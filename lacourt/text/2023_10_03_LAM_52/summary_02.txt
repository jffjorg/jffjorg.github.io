And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a trial that is estimated to require 119.75 hours of testimony. The plaintiff's estimates account for about 78% of the total hours. The court would need to accommodate the trial by holding it 4 days a week, which would allow for work on other cases. Considering the time needed for jury selection, opening statements, closing arguments, and deliberations, the trial would take over two months to complete. The judge notes that the case would qualify to be reassigned to a long cause department. The judge is not considering structural error, as neither party has alleged it. The judge's tentative ruling is intended to ensure justice is served and to accommodate the trial in a fair and efficient manner.

The court has reviewed the joint witness list and estimates that it can accommodate about 4.2 hours per day for trial. If the court were to accept the plaintiff's estimates, the trial would take over two months to complete, which would qualify the case for reassignment to a long cause department. The court notes that neither party has alleged structural error in the case, and therefore, a miscarriage of justice does not need to be shown. The court will consider the time needed for jury selection, opening statements, closing arguments, and deliberations when making its final ruling.
