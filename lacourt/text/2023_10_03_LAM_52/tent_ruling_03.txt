 Case Number:  20STCV32017    Hearing Date:   October 3, 2023    Dept:  52 Defendant S. Keven Steinberg dba Steinberg
Law’s Motion to Have Requests for Admissions, Set Two Deemed Admitted
Defendant
S. Keven Steinberg dba Steinberg Law moves for an order deeming admitted the
truth of the matters and the genuineness of documents specified in requests for
admissions, set two, to plaintiff Dan Wolfe. 
When
a party fails to respond to requests for admission, the requesting party may
move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any
matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted.  (CCP § 2033.280(b).)  Failure to timely respond to requests for
admission also waives any objection. 
(CCP § 2033.280(a).)
On May 26, 2023,
defendant served requests for admissions, set two on plaintiff by mail.  (Besa Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. A.)  Plaintiff was required to respond within 35
days.  (CCP § 2033.250(a) [30 days]; §
1013(a) [extra 5 days after service by mail].) 
His deadline to respond was therefore June 30.  In his declaration executed on July 20, defendant’s
counsel states, “To date Plaintiff has not provided any verified and complete
responses.”  (Besa Decl., ¶ 2.)  Plaintiff
did not timely respond to defendant’s requests for admissions, set two.  Defendant is therefore entitled to an order deeming the truth of the
matters specified in the requests admitted.
Defendant also moves for $1,310 in sanctions against
plaintiff.  “It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary
sanction … on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely
response to requests for admission necessitated [a] motion” to deem matters
admitted.  (CCP § 2033.280(c).)  Plaintiff’s failure to serve timely responses
to defendant’s requests necessitated this motion.  Sanctions are mandatory.  
Defendant, however, did not reasonably incur $1,310
in expenses.  Defendant claims expenses
including four hours of attorney fees at $250 hourly for drafting the motion
(Besa Decl., ¶ 8), the $60 filing fee (ibid.), and another $250 for an
hour of attorney fees anticipated in “reviewing, analyzing, and drafting a
reply to Plaintiff’s expected opposition and appearing at the hearing on this
motion” (id., ¶ 9).  Plaintiff did
not file an opposition.  Defendant did
not file a reply.  The court will
therefore only award expenses for half an hour for appearing at the hearing.  The total sanctions will be $1,185.
Disposition
Defendant S.
Keven Steinberg dba Steinberg Law’s motion to have requests for admissions, set
two deemed admitted is granted.  The truth of
matters specified in defendant’s request for admissions, set two (Nos. 120-141)
to plaintiff Dan Wolfe are hereby deemed admitted.
Plaintiff Dan Wolfe is hereby ordered to pay defendant S.
Keven Steinberg dba Steinberg Law $1,185 in sanctions within 30 days.
