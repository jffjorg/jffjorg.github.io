[2]    A miscarriage of justice need not be shown
if there is structural error.  (Aulisio v. Bankcroft (2014) 230
Cal.App.4th 1516, 1527.)  Neither party allege
structural error in this case.


[3] The joint witness
list estimated 119.75 total hours of testimony. 
Plaintiff’s estimates constituted about 78% of the total number of
hours.  In the court’s experience, it can
accommodate about 4.2 hours per day for trial. 
In a trial of this length, the court would have held trial four days a
week so that it could work on law and motion in other cases.  Considering the time needed for jury
selection, opening statements, closing arguments, and deliberations, the trial
would have taken over two months if the court had accepted the plaintiff’s
estimates.  The case would have also qualified
to be reassigned to a long cause department.
