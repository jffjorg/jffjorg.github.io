RELIEF REQUESTED 
Defendant, Rusnak/Pasadena, demurs to the fourth cause of action for negligent
repair in Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint (FAC) on grounds that: (1)
Plaintiff has not and cannot set forth facts sufficient to assert a negligent
repair cause of action, and (2) the negligent repair cause of action is barred
by the economic loss rule.


PROCEDURAL
Proof of Service
Timely Filed (CRC Rule 3.1300(c)): Ok
16/21 Court Days Lapsed (CCP § 1005(b)): Ok
Proper Address (CCP § 1013, § 1013a, § 1013b): Ok
Meet and Confer
A party filing a
demurrer “shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who
filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining
whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be
raised in the demurrer.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., §430.41, subd. (a).)  “The parties
shall meet and confer at least five days before the date the responsive
pleading is due. If the parties are not able to meet and confer at least five
days prior to the date the responsive pleading is due, the demurring party
shall be granted an automatic 30-day extension of time within which to file a
responsive pleading, by filing and serving, on or before the date on which a
demurrer would be due, a declaration stating under penalty of perjury that a
good faith attempt to meet and confer was made and explaining the reasons why
the parties could not meet and confer.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §430.41, subd. (a)(2).) 
Failure
to sufficiently meet and confer is not grounds to overrule or sustain a
demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., §430.41(a)(4).)
Here,
movant’s counsel attempted to meet and confer with Plaintiff’s counsel, but
Plaintiff’s counsel never responded to Defendant’s counsel’s electronic
correspondence nor did Plaintiff’s counsel return Defendant’s counsel’s phone
calls.
LEGAL STANDARDS FOR DEMURRERS
Demurrer
– Sufficiency
A demurrer for
sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda, (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th
740, 747.)  When considering demurrers,
courts read the allegations liberally and in context.  (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of
Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)  The court “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting
all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law ….”  (Berkley
v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) 
In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of
the pleading or via proper judicial notice. 
(Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.)  A demurrer tests the pleadings
alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters; therefore, it lies only
where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially
noticed.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.30,
430.70.)  The only issue involved in a
demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with
extraneous matters, states a cause of action. (Hahn, supra, 147
Cal.App.4th at 747.)  
The
general rule is that the plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts, not
evidentiary facts.  (Doe v. City of
Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550.) 
“All that is required of a plaintiff, as a matter of pleading … is that
his complaint set forth the essential facts of the case with reasonable
precision and with sufficient particularity to acquaint the defendant with the
nature, source and extent of his cause of action.”  (Rannard v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp.
(1945) 26 Cal.2d 149, 156-157.)  
On
demurrer, a trial court has an independent duty to “determine whether or not
the … complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action under any
legal theory.”  (Das v. Bank of
America, N.A. (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 727, 734.)  Demurrers do not lie as to only parts of
causes of action, where some valid claim is alleged but “must dispose of an
entire cause of action to be sustained.” 
(Poizner v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97,
119.)  “Generally it is an abuse of
discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if there is any
reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment.”  (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d
335, 349.)
PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS
The procedural
background in this case is confusing. 
The
original Complaint was filed on 9/13/2024. An answer was filed on 10/21/2024.
On
10/28/2024, a demurrer was filed against the original Complaint. The demurrer
was originally scheduled for 12/6/2024; however, on 11/22/2024 the demurrer hearing
was reset to 12/13/2024.
Additionally
on 11/22/2024, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC).
On
12/4/2024, another notice of continuance was filed by the Court continuing the
12/13/2024 hearing to 12/24/2024.
On
12/5/2024, this Court filed a notice of rejection of the amended complaint
(FAC) because Defendant filed an answer on 10/21/2024.
This
rejection of the filing of the FAC on 12/5/2024 appears to be improper. 
Under
CCP § 472(a), “A party may amend its pleading once without leave of the court
at any time before the answer, demurrer, or motion to strike is filed, or
after a demurrer or motion to strike is filed but before the demurrer or motion
to strike is heard if the amended pleading is filed and served no later than
the date for filing an opposition to the demurrer or motion to strike.”
(CCP § 472(a).)
Here,
since the demurrer hearing was set for 12/24/2024, when the FAC was filed and
served on 11/22/2024 it would have been timely filed and served because it was
filed and served before the date for filing an opposition to the demurrer.
This Court is ordered to strike the notice of rejection filed by
this Court on 12/5/2024.
It’s
also confusing that this Court drafted a work-up/tentative ruling on 12/24/2024
regarding the demurrer to the original Complaint when on 11/22/2024 the FAC was
already filed, and on 12/20/2024 the demurrer to the FAC
had already been filed. Despite, all this, on 12/24/2024, this Court sustained
the demurrer to the original complaint with leave to amend and Plaintiff was
ordered to file an FAC within 30 days of the 12/24/2024 order.
To
no surprise, no FAC was filed within 30 days of 12/24/2024 because presumably
the Plaintiff intended the FAC that was already filed on 11/22/2024 (and
rejected by this Court on 12/5/2024) to be the operative FAC.
Therefore, for purposes of this demurrer to the FAC, the Court
assumes that the FAC filed on 11/22/2024 is the operative pleading and strikes
the notice of rejection filed by this Court on 12/5/2024.
The
FAC alleges four causes of action. 
The
first three causes of action – (1) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of
Express Warranty, (2) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Implied
Warranty, and (3) Violation of the Song-Beverly Act Section 1793.2 – are
alleged against Defendant, Volkswagen Group of America, Inc.
The
fourth cause of action for negligent repair is alleged against Defendant,
Rusnak/Pasadena, a California Corporation d/b/a Audi Pasadena. 
The
instant demurrer to the FAC pertains to the fourth cause of action for
negligent repair alleged against Rusnak/Pasadena.
ANALYSIS
Negligence
Defendant argues that
Plaintiff’s fourth cause of action for negligence repair does not state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action.
 
To state a cause of
action for negligence, a plaintiff must allege (1) the defendant owed the
plaintiff a duty of care, (2) the defendant breached that duty, and (3) the
breach proximately caused the plaintiff's damages or injuries. (Lueras v.
BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 49, 62)
 
Here, Plaintiff
successfully alleges all elements of a negligence claim in ¶¶ 64-70 and ¶¶
12-16 of the FAC.
 
Defendant appears to
argue that Plaintiff did not allege a causal connection between the negligence
and Plaintiff’s injury.
 
Defendant’s argument is
unavailing. 
 
As stated in Christensen
v. Superior Court:
 
A plaintiff ” must allege a causal
connection between the negligence ... and the injury he
suffered. Ordinarily that is accomplished by implication from the
juxtaposition of the allegations of wrongful conduct and harm. (See 4 Witkin,
Cal. Procedure [(3d ed. 1985)] Pleading, §§ 561-566, pp. 600-606.) However,
where the pleaded facts of negligence and injury do not naturally give rise to
an inference of causation the plaintiff must plead specific
facts *901 affording an inference the one caused the others.“
 
(Christensen v. Superior Court (1991) 54 Cal.3d
868, 900-01.)
 
Here, the pleaded facts naturally give rise to an
inference of causation.
 
Defendant also argues that the FAC lacks any statement
of damages that Plaintiff is seeking with respect to the negligent repair
claim. 
 
Defendant cites to CCP § 425.10(a) which states, “(a) A
complaint or cross-complaint shall contain both of the following: (1) A
statement of the facts constituting the cause of action, in ordinary and
concise language. (2) A demand for judgment for the relief to which the
pleader claims to be entitled. If the recovery of money or damages is demanded,
the amount demanded shall be stated.” (CCP § 425.10(a).)
Here, Plaintiff’s Prayer for Relief prays for judgment
against Defendants as follows:
1. For general, special, and actual
damages according to proof at trial; 
2. For rescission of the purchase contract
and restitution of all monies expended; 
3. For diminution in value; 
4. For incidental and consequential
damages according to proof at trial; 
5. For civil penalty in the amount of two
times Plaintiff’s actual damages; 
6. For prejudgment interest at the legal
rate; 
7. For reasonable attorney’s fees and
costs of suit; and 
For such other and further relief as the
Court deems just and proper under the circumstances.
(FAC, Prayer for Relief.)
Here, although Defendant correctly notes that under
CCP § 425.10(a) the FAC lacks any statement about the amount of money damages
demanded, the Court does not find this as grounds to sustain a demurrer.
Defendant’s citation to CCP § 425.10(a) with respect
to damages appears to be accurate; however, the cases that Defendant cites as
this being grounds to sustain a demurrer are inapposite. 
Defendant attempts to support its argument that not
complying with § 425.10(a) is grounds to sustain a demurrer by citing to Van
Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1520 and Becker v. S.P.V.
Construction Co. (1980) 27 Cal.3d 489, 494. The Court notes that neither of
those cases sustained a demurrer for not complying with § 425.10. The crux of both
of those cases cited by Defendant pertained to default judgments. Defendant’s
cases are inapposite, and the Court will not rely on a hyper-technical argument
pertaining to § 425.10 to sustain a demurrer when Defendant cited no case law
supporting the argument that not complying with § 425.10 is grounds for
sustaining a demurrer.

Economic
Loss Rule
Defendant argues that
Plaintiff’s negligent repair claim is barred by the economic-loss rule.
Defendant’s
arguments are unavailing for several reasons. 
Defendant
argues that Plaintiff does not allege they sustained any personal injuries as a
result of Defendant’s negligence. Defendant then argues that when Plaintiff’s
damages consist solely of alleged economic loss, the economic loss doctrine
precludes recovery in tort for product liability. 
Defendant’s
argument is unavailing because this cause of action is not seeking recovery in
tort for product liability. 
The
fourth cause of action is not alleged against the manufacturer, and the fourth
cause of action is for the negligent repair of the vehicle. The fourth cause of
action has nothing to do with seeking recovery in tort for product liability.
To
demonstrate how Defendant’s application of the economic-loss rule is inapposite
in the instant context, the Court points to a case relied upon by Defendant – Robinson
Helicopter Co., Inc. v. Dana Corp. (2004) 34 Cal.4th 979 (Robinson).

In Robinson, a helicopter manufacturer brought
action against a parts supplier for breach of contract, breach of warranty, and
intentional and negligent misrepresentation after the supplier changed
manufacturing process for helicopter clutches, which resulted in an increased
failure rate. Robinson summarized the economic loss rule as follows:
Economic loss consists of “ ‘ “ ‘damages
for inadequate value, costs of repair and replacement of the defective product
or consequent loss of profits—without any claim of personal injury or damages
to other property....’ ” ' [Citation.]” (Jimenez v. Superior Court (2002)
29 Cal.4th 473, 482, 127 Cal.Rptr.2d 614, 58 P.3d 450.) Simply
stated, the economic loss rule provides: “ ‘ “[W]here a purchaser's
expectations in a sale are frustrated because the product he bought is not
working properly, his remedy is said to be in contract alone, for he has
suffered only ‘economic’ losses.” ' This doctrine hinges on a distinction
drawn between transactions involving the sale of goods for commercial purposes
where economic expectations are protected by commercial and contract law, and
those involving the sale of defective products to individual consumers who are
injured in a manner which has traditionally been remedied by resort to the law
of torts.” (Neibarger v. Universal Cooperatives, Inc. (1992)
439 Mich. 512, 486 N.W.2d 612, 615, fns. omitted.) The economic loss rule
requires a purchaser to recover in contract for purely economic loss due to
disappointed expectations, unless he can demonstrate harm above and beyond a
broken contractual promise.  (Redarowicz v. Ohlendorf (1982)
92 Ill.2d 171, 65 Ill.Dec. 411, 441 N.E.2d 324, 327.) Quite simply, the
economic loss rule “prevent[s] the law of contract and the law of tort from
dissolving one into the other.” (Rich Products Corp. v. Kemutec,
Inc. (E.D.Wis.1999) 66 F.Supp.2d 937, 969.)
In Jimenez v. Superior Court,
supra, 29 Cal.4th 473, 127 Cal.Rptr.2d 614, 58 P.3d
450, we set forth the rationale for the economic loss rule: “ ‘The distinction
that the law has drawn between tort recovery for physical injuries and
warranty recovery for economic loss is not arbitrary and does not rest on the
“luck” of one plaintiff in having an accident causing physical injury. The
distinction rests, rather, on an understanding of the nature of the
responsibility a manufacturer must undertake in distributing his products.’
[Citation.] We concluded that the nature of this responsibility meant that a
manufacturer could appropriately be held liable for physical injuries
(including both personal injury and damage to property other than the product
itself), regardless of the terms of any warranty. [Citation.] But the
manufacturer could not be held liable for ‘the level of performance of his
products in the consumer's business unless he agrees that the product was
designed to meet the consumer's demands.’ [Citation.]” (Id. at
p. 482, 127 Cal.Rptr.2d 614, 58 P.3d 450.)
(Robinson Helicopter
Co., Inc. v. Dana Corp. (2004) 34 Cal.4th 979, 988-989.)
Defendant’s arguments
about Robinson are unavailing, as Robinson appears to evaluate the
economic-loss rule to draw a distinction between transactions involving the
sale of goods  in the context of contract
law and those involving defective products sold to consumers in the context of
tort law.
Here, we don’t have the
sale of goods/products, nor do we have a products liability case. 
The fourth cause of
action is asserted only for negligent repair against the entity that tried to
repair the vehicle. 
Further, Defendant cited
cases like Sacramento Regional Transit Dist. v. Grumman Flexible (1984)
158 Cal.App.3d 289 and Seely v. White Motor Co. (1965) 63 Cal.2d 9. When
discussing these two cases, and many others, the Second District Court of Appeal
stated, “From all of these cases, we conclude that in actions arising from the
sale or purchase of a defective product, plaintiffs seeking economic losses
must be able to demonstrate that either physical damage to property (other than
the defective product itself) or personal injury accompanied such losses; if
they cannot, then they would be precluded from any tort recovery in strict
liability or negligence. However, such authorities would seem to have little or
no application when the commercial relationship of the parties does not involve
the sale of goods or products, nor the rules developed under the law merchant
and the Uniform Commercial Code, but rather relates only *781 to the
performance of services.” (North American Chemical Co. v. Superior Court (1997)
59 Cal.App.4th 764, 780-81.)
Here, Plaintiff’s fourth
cause of action for negligent repair (that is alleged against the entity that
performed the repairs and not the car manufacturer) has nothing to do with the
sale or purchase of a defective product.
Further, with respect to Robinson,
the Supreme Court of California ruled that “We hold the economic loss rule does
not bar Robinson’s fraud and intentional misrepresentation claims because they
were independent of Dana’s breach of contract.” (Robinson at 991 citing Erlich
v. Menezes (1999) 21 Cal.4th  543,
552-554.) Here, while it is unclear if Robinson even applies in the
instant context for negligent repair, the negligent repair cause of action is
rooted in tort and independent of the first three causes of action alleged
against the manufacturer for violation of the Song-Beverly Act.
Additionally, Defendant’s
Reply is unavailing. 
TENTATIVE RULING
Defendant’s
demurrer to the fourth cause of action for negligent repair is OVERULED. Plaintiff
stated facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and the economic-loss
rule does not appear to be applicable in the instant context.
