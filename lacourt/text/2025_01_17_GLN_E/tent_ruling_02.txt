BACKGROUND
On
03/11/2024, Plaintiff, Salvador Z. Solano, filed the instant action against
Defendant, General Motors LLC, alleging five causes of action for: (1)
Violation of Civil Code 1793.2(d); (2) Violation of Civil Code 1793.2(b); (3)
Violation of Civil Code 1793.2(a)(3); (4) Breach of Express Written Warranty
Civil Code 1791.2(a), Section 1794; and (5) Breach of the Implied Warranty of
Merchantability Civil Code 1791.1, Section 1794.
The instant action pertains to Plaintiff’s
September 8, 2019 purchase of a 2019 Chevrolet Silverado.

Plaintiff alleges that during the warranty period the
subject vehicle developed defects to the engine; electrical system; transmission
system; braking system; and any additional complaints made by Plaintiff,
whether or not they are contained in the records or any repair orders. (Compl.
¶ 12.)
LEGAL STANDARD – COMPEL FURTHER – REQUESTS
FOR PRODUCTION
Under
CCP § 2017.010, “any party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not
privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending
action..., if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.”  The Section specifically provides that
“[d]iscovery may relate to the claim or defense of the party seeking discovery
or of any other party to the action,” and that discovery “may be obtained of
the identity and location of persons having knowledge of any discoverable
matter, as well as of the existence, description, nature, custody, condition
and location of any document, electronically stored information, tangible
thing, or land or other property.”
 
CCP § 2031.310(a) provides that a party demanding a document
inspection may move for an order compelling further responses to the demand if
the demanding party deems that:
“(1)   A statement of
compliance with the demand is incomplete.
  (2)   A representation of inability to comply is
inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.
  (3)   An objection in the response is without
merit or too general.”  
 
(CCP
§ 2031.310(a).)
 
Under CCP § 2031.310(b)(1), “The motion shall set forth
specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the
demand.”  
 
“In the more specific context of a
demand for production of a tangible thing, the party who asks the trial court
to compel production must show “good cause” for the request—but unless there is
a legitimate privilege issue or claim of attorney work product, that burden is
met simply by a fact-specific showing of relevance.” (TBG Ins. Services
Corp. v. Superior Court (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 443, 448.)

PROCEDURAL ANALYSIS
45-Day Requirement
Unless
notice of this motion is given within 45 days of the service of the verified
response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific
later date to which the demanding party and the responding party have agreed in
writing, the demanding party waives any right to compel a further response to
the demand. (CCP § 2031.310(c).) 
Here, Plaintiff’s motion is timely.
Meet and Confer
“The
motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040.” (CCP § 2031.310(b)(2).)
Here, Plaintiff’s counsel met and conferred.
