And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling states that Plaintiff Micah Abshear moves to compel responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories—employment law, and for sanctions. In opposition, Defendant's attorney filed a declaration indicating that Plaintiff's former counsel served form interrogatories—employment law and Defendant served responses upon Plaintiff's former counsel on February 8, 2022. However, Plaintiff's current counsel has again served Defendant with form interrogatories—employment law. The court rules that if Defendant has already served responses to form interrogatories—employment law, they need not serve the responses again. If Plaintiff's current counsel cannot locate the 2022 responses, Defendant is to serve a copy of those responses upon Plaintiff. The court also denies Plaintiff's request for sanctions.
