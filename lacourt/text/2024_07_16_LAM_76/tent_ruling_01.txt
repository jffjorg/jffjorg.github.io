TENTATIVE RULING 
Plaintiff Micah Abshear moves to
compel responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories—employment
law and for sanctions.
In opposition, attorney Andrew
M. Wyatt filed a declaration indicating that Plaintiff’s former counsel served
form interrogatories—employment law, and Defendant served responses upon
Plaintiffs former counsel on February 8, 2022. However, current counsel has
again served Defendant with form interrogatories—employment law.
If Defendant already served
responses to form interrogatories—employment law, they need not serve the
responses again. If Plaintiff’s current counsel cannot locate such responses,
Defendant is to serve a copy of those 2022 responses upon Plaintiff. If any
event, Plaintiff’s request for sanctions will be DENIED.
