ANALYSIS
 
Petition To Confirm Arbitration Award
 
Discussion
 
Petitioner
Richard Alan Skelton, Jr. brings a petition to confirm FINRA arbitration award.
 
The petition to confirm must be
served and filed no later than four years after the date of service of a signed
copy of the award on the petitioner (Code Civ. Proc., § 1288) but may not be
served and filed until at least 10 days after service of the signed copy of the
award upon the petitioner. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1288.4.)
 
            Although a petition to confirm arbitration award may be filed after 10
days of the service of the award (Civ. Proc. Code, § 1288.4), the hearing must
be at least 100 days after the service of the award (Civ. Proc. Code, §
1288.2), which is the period of time in which the respondent may either file a
file a petition to vacate the award, even if that time is beyond the 10 days in
which the respondent may file a response to the petition. (Civ. Proc. Code, §§
1285.2, 1290.6.) As articulated by the California Supreme Court, it
appears that a response to a petition to confirm an arbitration award,
which response seeks to vacate or reduce the award, may be served within 100
days of the service of the award.(Law Fin.
Grp., LLC v. Key (2023)
14 Cal.5th 932, 946-47.)
 
            Here, the award is dated April 1,
2024, and was served upon the parties on April 2, 2024. 
 
            The 100-day period following the service
of the award expires on July 11, 2024. As such, this hearing is after that
period in which a petition to vacate may be filed. 
 
            The Court
notes that FINRA has obtained a waiver from FINRA of the requirement to name
FINA as a part to the action to confirm the arbitration award. (Declaration of
Chad Weaver, Exh. E.)
 
Any party to an arbitration award
may petition the court to confirm, correct, or vacate the award. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1285.) “If a petition or response under this chapter is duly served
and filed, the court shall confirm
the award as made, whether rendered in this state or another state, unless in
accordance with this chapter it corrects the award and confirms it as
corrected, vacates the award or dismisses the proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1286 [bold emphasis added].) A petition to confirm a binding arbitration shall
name as respondents all parties to the arbitration and may name any other
parties to be bound by the award. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.) The petition shall
(1) set forth the substance of or have attached a copy of the agreement to
arbitrate unless petitioner denies the existence of such an agreement; (2) set
forth the name(s) of the arbitrator(s); and (3) set forth or have attached a
copy of the award and written opinion of the arbitrator. (Code Civ. Proc., §
1285.4(a)-(c).)
 
Cal. Civ. Proc, § 1290.4 governs
the method of service of the petition to confirm arbitration as follows:
 
(a) A copy of the petition and a
written notice of the time and place of the hearing thereof and any other
papers upon which the petition is based shall be served in the manner provided
in the arbitration agreement for the service of such petition and notice.
 
(b) If the arbitration agreement
does not provide the manner in which such service shall be made and the person
upon whom service is to be made has not previously appeared in the proceeding
and has not previously been served in accordance with this subdivision:
 
(1) Service within this State shall
be made in the manner provided by law for the service of summons in an action.
 
    
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.4(b)(2) [bold emphasis added].)
 
Here,
the petition was served by e-mail only on June 7, 2024. A copy of the
arbitration agreement was not attached to the Petition, so it is unclear
whether the arbitration agreement permitted service by e-mail. As such, the
Court applies Civ. Proc. Code, § 1290.4(b)(2) to require that the Petition by
served by personal service, substituted service or mailing and notice of
acknowledgment. 
 
Accordingly,
the hearing on the petition to confirm arbitration award is CONTINUED to August
23, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. Petitioner to properly serve a copy of the petition, as
well as notice of the continuance of the hearing on the petition, and to file
proof of service.
