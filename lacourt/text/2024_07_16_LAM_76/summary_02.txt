And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has continued the hearing on the petition to confirm an arbitration award to August 23, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. The petitioner, Richard Alan Skelton, Jr., must properly serve a copy of the petition and notice of the continuance of the hearing on the petition, and file proof of service. The judge's decision is based on the fact that the petition was served by e-mail only, which is not a sufficient method of service under California law. The judge also notes that the 100-day period in which the respondent may file a petition to vacate the award has expired.
