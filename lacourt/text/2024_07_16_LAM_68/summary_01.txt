And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for $11,189.03 in monetary sanctions. The defendants claimed that the plaintiffs' first amended PAGA complaint lacked a factual or legal basis, but the judge found insufficient support for this claim. The judge also ruled that the court would not punish counsel for rightfully seeking to adjudicate employment claims. The judge further declined to use the sanctions motion as a means of initially adjudicating the entire action under the guise of a threat of sanctions against the plaintiffs. The judge noted that the defendants may consider an action for malicious prosecution if they prevail. The case management and conference, as well as the outstanding OSCs, are set for July 24, 2024, and the defendants are ordered to provide notice.
