REQUESTED
Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories (set one)
 
SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiffs
were tenants of a single family dwelling at 32270 Saticoy Street, West Hills,
and allege unsanitary and/or unsafe conditions on the premises as a result of
improper maintenance and upkeep. 
 
On
October 17, 2022, Plaintiffs filed their complaint for Failure to Provide
Habitable Dwellings, Breach of Covenant of Right to Quiet Enjoyment and
Possession of the Property, Nuisance, and Negligence. Defendants answered the
complaint on February 23, 2023.
 
On
June 10, 2024, Derrick Robinson filed a Request for Dismissal from the
complaint. 
 
RULING: Granted.
Defendant, Samuel Welch moves to compel further responses to
form interrogatories (set one), numbers 2.6, 12.4, 12.7, and 13.1, from
Plaintiff Iyana Jackson. The responses consist of incomplete replies, with
assurances of later production upon entry into a protective order, admission of
certain unspecified documents or media, or references to other parties and
non-parties responsible for the provision of information. 
 
The responses are incomplete and fail to respond to all
subcategories of the requests. The references to other persons constitutes an
improper, factually incomplete answer. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84
Cal.App.3d 771, 783–784 [“Answers must be complete and responsive. Thus, it is
not proper to answer by stating, ‘See my deposition’, ’See my pleading’, or
‘See the financial statement’”].)
 
The motion is therefore granted. Responding is ordered to
serve responses in compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.210-20310240.
No sanctions requested. 
 
The court calendar shows nine remaining, scheduled motions
to compel further responses through July 22, 2024. The motions appear as a
continuation of discovery issues addressed by the court in the 23 motions to
compel responses granted on November 22, 2023.
 
The court does not conduct any informal discovery conferences.
While the court understands the prior use and perhaps reliance on the IDC
system, the court finds the number of items on the court calendar through the
next three months presents a potentially inordinate burden. The court reserves
the right to set an OSC re: Discovery Referee in lieu of a hearing on any given
motion, and may take off any and all motions in lieu of the OSC hearing. The
court invites the parties to continue meeting and conferring, including the
provision of supplemental responses, when possible. 
 
Next
set of motions to compel further responses begins with Noah Penn-El beginning
on July 2, 2024.
 
Defendant
to give notice.
