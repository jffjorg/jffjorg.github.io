RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant, Ascot Insurance Company
RELIEF REQUESTED: Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay Action

SUMMARY OF ACTION:
Plaintiff Ritz Systems, Inc. acquired commercial premises insurance from Ascot Insurance Company with a business personal property coverage of $15,000,000 and business and extra expense coverage of $3,000,000. The policy was reduced from $15,000,000 to $10,000,000 without the request or approval of Plaintiff. A fire caused by a neighbor destroyed the warehouse, leading to a claim for $16,808,284. Ascot agreed to a claim amount of $2,000,000.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the motion to compel arbitration and stay action brought by Plaintiff Ritz Systems, Inc. against Defendant Ascot Insurance Company. The dispute arises from a fire that destroyed the warehouse, which was insured by Ascot, and the parties' disagreement over the amount of loss and the actual cash value of covered property. The court finds that the plain language of the policy does not require mutual acceptance for appraisal, and allows the appraisal process to occur despite the coverage dispute. The court orders Plaintiffs and Ascot into an appraisal, but notes that any award rendered may be subject to reversal if the coverage issue is not resolved.
