The court has denied the plaintiff's application for default judgment as premature. The defendant's default has not been entered on the First Amended Complaint. Additionally, the court has identified several defects in the plaintiff's application, including the failure to dismiss Doe defendants, failure to provide a summary of the case, failure to attach relevant agreements, and failure to provide an interest calculation. The court has ordered a Case Management Conference and an Order to Show Cause Re: Why Sanctions Should Not Be Imposed Against Plaintiff for Failure to Appear on April 8, 2024, set for July 16, 2024.
