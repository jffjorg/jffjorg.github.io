And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's application for default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff loaned Fu Corp. $1,320,000.00 at 5% interest for a one-year term, but Fu Corp. failed to pay the outstanding balance. The plaintiff filed a complaint against Fu Corp, Dos Lagos, Chen, and Does 1-10 for breach of contract and breach of personal guarantee. However, the plaintiff failed to comply with several court rules and procedures, including submitting a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought and providing a showing of grounds for each judgment. The plaintiff also failed to utilize the most current version of Judicial Council form CIV-100 and failed to reconcile discrepancies in their proposed judgment. As a result, the judge has denied the plaintiff's application for default judgment without prejudice.
