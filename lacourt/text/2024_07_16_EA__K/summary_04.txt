And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the motions filed by the defendant to continue the depositions of Rosa and Jasmine, and to take their depositions at a different location. The judge notes that the depositions were initially noticed for April 3 and 4, 2024, but were rescheduled to March 3 and 4, 2024 due to the defendant's notice of continuance. Rosa and Jasmine objected to the rescheduling, claiming they were not available at the new dates.

The judge finds that the motion is not moot, despite the fact that Jasmine failed to appear for her deposition on March 4, 2024. The judge also notes that the parties are entitled to a protective order, which would prevent the depositions from being taken at a location that is not within 75 miles of the deponent's residence, as required by Code of Civil Procedure § 2025.250.

The judge's tentative ruling is pending further submission of the parties' arguments and evidence.
