1.         Motion to
Compel Plaintiff Ricardo’s Deposition
Legal Standard
“If, after service
of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing
agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that
is a party under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid objection . .
., fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for
inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing
described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an
order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production
for inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd.
(a).)
A motion to compel
deposition “shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the
documents, electronically stored information, or things described in the
deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted
the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,
subd. (b)(2).)
The
motion shall also “set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the
production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or
tangible thing described in the deposition notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.450, subd. (b)(1).)
A court shall impose
monetary sanctions if the motion to compel is granted, “unless the court finds
that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or
that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)
Discussion
Defendant moves the court for an order compelling Ricardo to
appear for an in-person deposition on a date and time certain within 30 days of
the court’s ruling on this motion. Defendant also seeks sanctions against
Ricardo and his counsel in the amount of $1,957.20.
Defendant’s counsel Dwayne S. Beck (“Beck”) represents as
follows:
On September 19, 2023, Defendant served Ricardo with a
“Notice of Deposition,” wherein Ricardo’s deposition was scheduled for April 2,
2024 at Beck’s office in Riverside. (Beck Decl., ¶ 5, Exh. A.) On October 11,
2023, Defendant served Ricardo with a “Notice of Continuance of Taking
Deposition of Plaintiff,” rescheduling Ricardo’s deposition to March 8, 2024 at
Beck’s office. (Id., ¶ 6, Exh. B.) On February 14, 2024, Ricardo served
an objection thereto, advising that he was not available for his deposition at
the date and time scheduled. (Id., ¶ 7, Exh. C.) On February 14 and 23,
2024, Beck’s office emailed Ricardo’s counsel’s office to obtain Ricardo’s
availability for deposition. (Id., ¶ 8, Exh. D.) On February 27, 2024,
Beck sent Ricardo’s counsel a letter, advising therein that while he had
received Ricardo’s February 14, 2024 objection, he would be moving forward with
the depositions of the three plaintiffs as scheduled since he hadn’t received alternate
dates. (Id., Exh. E.) On February 27, 2024, Ricardo’s counsel’s office
responded that Ricardo was available for deposition on April 19, 22, and 26,
2024, at 10:00 a.m. via Zoom. (Id., ¶ 9, Exh. D.) Beck’s office
responded the same day, advising that none of the above dates worked but that
Beck was available May 6, 2024 to take all three plaintiffs’ depositions
in-person. (Id., ¶ 10, Exh. D.) Ricardo’s counsel’s office advised that
May 6, 2024 was not a workable date and offered Beck their office to conduct in
person depositions. (Id., ¶ 11, Exh. D.) Counsel thereafter exchanged
communications disputing the location of the deposition. (Id., ¶¶ 12-18,
Exhs. D and F.) On March 8, 2024, Beck took a Certificate of Non-Appearance
after Ricardo failed to appear for deposition. (Id., ¶ 20, Exh. G.)
The procedural history on ecourt reflects that Beck
requested an Informal Discovery Conference (“IDC”) on March 29, 2024, which the
court granted on April 2, 2024 and set for May 22, 2024. On May 17, 2024, the
court advanced the IDC pursuant to Defendant’s ex parte application, heard the
IDC, noted that the discovery issued were not resolved and permitted the
parties to file discovery motions. The instant motion followed on May 23, 2024.
Ricardo, in opposition, contends that the motion is moot,
because the March 8, 2024 date scheduled for deposition has since passed.
Ricardo’s argument is nonsensical because it was Ricardo’s failure to appear at
his deposition on March 8, 2024, which lead to the filing of the instant
motion.
Ricardo then asserts that “[t]here is Good Cause for
Protective Order.” (Opp., 3:3). Ricardo, however, never moved for a protective
order.
Counsel’s dispute hinges on their varying interpretation of
Code of Civil Procedure § 2025.310, which reads, in relevant part, as follows:
(a)        At the election of the deponent or the
deposing party, the deposition 
officer may
attend the deposition at a different location than the deponent 
via remote means.
A deponent is not required to be physically present with 
the deposition
officer when being sworn in at the time of the deposition.
(b)       Subject to Section 2025.420, any party or
attorney of record may, but is 
not required to,
be physically present at the deposition at the location of the 
deponent. . .
(d)       An exercise of the authority granted by
subdivision (a) or (b) does not 
waive any other
provision of this title, including, but not limited to, 
provisions
regarding the time, place, or manner in which a deposition shall 
be conducted . .
.
Defendant’s counsel contends that Ricado must attend his
deposition in-person, while Ricardo’s counsel contends that Ricardo may attend
same remotely.
The court is persuaded that when subdivisions (a) and (d) are
read together an election made pursuant to subdivision (a) is not intended to supplant
Code of Civil Procedure §§ 2025.220, subdivision (a)[1]
and 2025.250, subdivision (a)[2]
regarding the place where a deposition is conducted. The deposing party chooses
the location of the deposition pursuant to the above provisions, provided that
the location is within certain geographical limits.
The motion, then, is granted. Ricardo is ordered to submit to
an in-person deposition within 30 days from the date of the notice of
ruling.
Sanctions
Defendant
seeks sanctions against Ricardo and his counsel in the amount of $1,957.20
[calculated as follows: 2 hours preparing motion, plus 1 hour
meeting/conferring, plus 1.5 hours preparing
reply plus 1 hour attending hearing at $250.00/hour, plus $60.00 filing fee,
plus $522.20 for Certificate of Non-Appearance].
Utilizing
a Lodestar approach, and in view of the totality of the circumstances, the
court finds that the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs
incurred for the work performed in connection with the pending motion is $1,082.20
(i.e., 1 hour preparing motion, plus 0.5 hours meet/confer, plus 0.5 hours
