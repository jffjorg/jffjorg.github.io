And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Defendant Juan Hernandez Banuelos' motions to compel the depositions of Plaintiffs Ricardo Penaloza, Rosa Penaloza, and Jasmine Penaloza. The judge orders each plaintiff to submit to an in-person deposition within 30 days from the date of the notice of ruling. The judge also awards sanctions against each plaintiff and their counsel in the amounts of $1,082.20, $560.00, and $1,232.20, respectively. The sanctions are payable within 30 days from the date of the notice of ruling. The court's ruling is based on the defendant's failure to appear for deposition and the plaintiffs' refusal to comply with the deposition notices. The court finds that the defendant has shown good cause for the production of the depositions and that the plaintiffs' failure to appear is unjustified.
