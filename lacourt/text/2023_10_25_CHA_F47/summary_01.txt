(Christopher L. Lawrence, declaration)
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The motion for determination of good faith settlement filed by the Rose Defendants is denied without prejudice. The motion claims that the settlement between the Rose Defendants, Plaintiff Raul Cabrera, and Samuel F. Rose Properties, LLC was made in good faith and requests an order dismissing any pending and future claims for equitable contribution or total, partial, and comparative indemnity against the Rose Defendants based on comparative negligence or comparative fault.

The judge finds that the motion is not supported by sufficient evidence and that the Rose Defendants' declaration, which is the only evidence offered in support of the motion, does not provide a basis for the conclusion that the attack on the Plaintiff was unforeseeable. The judge also notes that the motion fails to provide copies of the documents relied upon, such as the Master Lease, the Assignment, and the Renewal, which makes it difficult to determine the relationship between the parties and the potential liability of Samuel F. Rose Properties, LLC.

The judge concludes that the motion is denied without prejudice, meaning that the parties can still file a new motion or appeal the decision.
