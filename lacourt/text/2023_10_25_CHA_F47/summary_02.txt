And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the demurrer and the motion to strike, both with 30 days leave to amend. The plaintiff, Gerardo Zavala, alleged that the defendant, American Honda Motor Co., Inc., violated the Song-Beverly Act - Breach of Express Warranty and engaged in fraudulent inducement - concealment. The defendant filed a demurrer and motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages, which the court has granted.

The court found that the plaintiff's complaint failed to allege facts sufficient to support a cause of action for fraudulent inducement - concealment. Specifically, the court found that the plaintiff did not allege that the defendant definitively knew about the purportedly concealed information, nor did the plaintiff allege facts to support a finding that the defendant had exclusive knowledge of material facts not known to the plaintiff.

Furthermore, the court found that the plaintiff failed to cite adequate binding authority to support his position, and that the plaintiff's reliance on non-binding authority was misplaced. The court also found that the plaintiff's claim was barred by the "economic loss rule," which prohibits recovery of economic loss associated with the product itself.

The court has given the plaintiff 30 days to amend its complaint to try to cure the defects in its pleading.
