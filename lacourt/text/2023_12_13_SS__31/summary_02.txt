And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Michael Evich Kirsanov's unopposed motion for leave to file a First Amended Answer (FAA) to Plaintiff Emerson Langlois-Ulrich's complaint. The FAA seeks to add an affirmative defense based on prelitigation settlement of Plaintiff's claims. The judge found that Defendant failed to comply with California Rules of Court (CRC) Rule 3.1324(a)(3) and (b) by not specifying what allegations are proposed to be added to the previous Answer and where they can be found. The judge also noted that Defendant's separate declaration did not clearly address each factor of CRC Rule 3.1324(b). The judge denied the motion without prejudice to Defendant re-filing a motion for leave to amend after curing the defects. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if a party intends to submit on the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the required information.
