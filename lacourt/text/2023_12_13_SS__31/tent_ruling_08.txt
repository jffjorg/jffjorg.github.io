 Case Number:  22STCV02453    Hearing Date:   December 13, 2023    Dept:  31 DEPT:   31 OSC DATE:  12/13/2023 CASE NAME/NUMBER:  22STCV02453 ROZA ZADORIAN vs INDIA SWEETS & SPICES CHAI & CAFE, LLC REQUEST FOR COURT JUDGMENT AGAINST [DEFAULTING PARTY]:  India Sweets & Spices Chai & Cafe, LLC RECOMMENDATION:    DENY for reasons stated below.  TENTATIVE  This action arises from an alleged trip and fall on August 2, 2021 in the parking lot of Defendant India Sweets & Spices Chai & Cafe, LLC’s (“Defendant”) store. Plaintiff alleges she fell on an unkempt and uneven patch of asphalt.   The request for default judgment submitted on October 23, 2023 is DENIED for the following reasons:  Plaintiff’s declaration is unsigned.   Additionally, Plaintiff avers that her medical specials amount to $229,737.51. However, in accordance with Howell v. Hamilton Meats & Provisions, Inc. (2011) 52 Cal. 4th 541, a plaintiff's recovery for past medical expenses will be limited to the amounts actually paid or owed or the reasonable value of the care provided, whichever is less. In other words, an injured plaintiff is limited to recovering the discounted amount health insurance pays on their behalf as past medical damages, not the inflated amount medical providers bill health insurance companies for their services.  The Court notes that it appears that a significant portion of Plaintiff’s medical specials were contractually adjusted because Plaintiff used insurance for medical treatment. (Decl. Exh. 3 at p. 44.) Plaintiff is only entitled to recover the actual amount paid for by health insurance after deducting the contractual adjustments, not the full inflated amount. In the amended default package, the Court requests Plaintiff, with the assistance of her counsel, to adjust the amount requested and to affirmatively demonstrate that the amount sought represents the true amount actually paid for by insurance or owed by Plaintiff for Plaintiff’s past medical specials.   Further, in terms of general damages for pain and suffering, Plaintiff does not provide sufficient evidence of lingering injuries to support $1,150,000 in damages. Facts and circumstances that establish reliable indicia of pain and suffering include evidence such as numerous visits to medical provider(s), a declaration from a treating physician, evidence of problems adjusting to injuries, permanent disfiguration or permanency of injury, disabilities, and so forth. Plaintiff must substantiate her claim for general damages with sufficient and admissible evidence. If Plaintiff is unable to support her allegations, then she must reduce the amounts sought accordingly.    No later than ___________, Plaintiff is to submit a new default judgment package correcting these defects.  Failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal. The OSC re entry of default judgment is continued to _____________.
