 Case Number:  20STCV45169    Hearing Date:   December 13, 2023    Dept:  31 DEPT:   31 OSC DATE:  12/13/2023 CASE NAME/NUMBER:  20STCV45169 ANA MORALES vs ARGO SPRING MANUFACTURING CO., INC. REQUEST FOR COURT JUDGMENT AGAINST [DEFAULTING PARTY]:  ARGO SPRING MANUFACTURING CO., INC RECOMMENDATION:  GRANT in the following amounts: Principal damages: $510,736.03 Costs: $3,446.20 TOTAL: $514,182.23  TENTATIVE  On March 11, 2021, Defendant Argo Spring Manufacturing Co., Inc. (“Defendant”) filed an Answer to Plaintiff’s Complaint. On April 11, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion for terminating sanctions, and Defendant’s Answer was stricken, and default entered pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 2023.030. (Min. Order, April 11, 2023.) On July 19, 2023, the Court denied Defendant’s motion for reconsideration of the April 11, 2023 ruling. (Min. Order, July 19, 2023.)  Plaintiff alleges injuries arising from a Power Press machine incident on November 30, 2018. Plaintiff declares she was using a power press machine, which had a guard removed, when Plaintiff’s right middle finger was crushed by the press at the point of operation. Consequently, Plaintiff suffered an amputation of the tip of the middle finger on her right hand.   Plaintiff seeks $1,948,725.72 in principal damages, which is comprised of $448,725.72 in special damages and $1.5 million in general damages. Additionally, Plaintiff seeks $3,446.20 in costs, and appropriately provides an itemization of each item.  Plaintiff’s declaration in support provides that her past medical specials amount to $59,222.16, her future medical care amounts to $197,377.56, and her loss of earnings amount to $192,126 ($111,320 in past lost earnings from December 1, 2018 to October 6, 2023, and $80,806 in future lost earnings.)  The Court notes that on default, Plaintiff is necessarily capped by the Statement of Damages served on Defendant. Plaintiff’s January 20, 2023 Statement of Damages provides that she is seeking $1.5 million in general damages, and for special damages - $29,950.47 in medical expenses, $1 million in future medical expenses, and $83,408 in loss of earnings.   In personal injury and wrongful death cases, a plaintiff must serve a statement of damages setting forth the nature and amount of damages to be sought before default may be taken. (Code Civ. Proc., section 425.11.) The purpose of the statement of damages is to ensure that a defendant who declines to contest an action does not thereby subject himself to open ended liability. (Schwab v. Rondel Homes, Inc. (1991) 53 Cal.3d 428, 435 (quoting Greenup v. Rodman (1986) 42 Cal.3d 822, 826.) The amount sought cannot exceed the amount pled in the operative complaint/cross-complaint or set forth in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., § 580(a); Airs Aromatics, LLC v. CBL Data Recovery Technologies, Inc. (2018) 23 Cal.App.5th 1013, 1018.)  Therefore, although Plaintiff cured the defects previously identified in the Court’s July 28, 2023 order and provides documentation substantiating her damages claim, the amount sought in past medical specials and loss of earnings is excess of the amounts provided in the Statement of Damages. Accordingly, on default judgment, the Court is only able to award the maximum amount provided in the Statement of Damages as to medical specials and loss of earnings. Further, the Court does not find the documentation sufficient to support an award for $1.5 million in general damages on default judgment, and will reduce the amount.   Based on the foregoing, the request for default judgment submitted on October 6, 2023 is GRANTED in the principal amount of $510,736.03 ($310,736.03 in special damages and $200,000 general damages), and $3,446.20 in costs, for the total amount of $514,182.23 against Defendant Argo Spring Manufacturing Co., Inc. ¿¿  Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.¿¿¿¿
