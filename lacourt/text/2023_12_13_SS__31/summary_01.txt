And here is the English summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's request for default judgment against the Defendants, Aria, Nahid, and Parviz Servatjoo. The Plaintiff alleged that Parviz hit him in the face with a closed fist, causing injury, and sought damages and costs. The Judge ruled that the Plaintiff did not establish a basis of liability for Aria and Nahid as parents because Parviz was not a minor at the time of the incident and they were not involved in the incident to impose direct liability. The Judge also noted that the Plaintiff's declaration referenced exhibits that were not attached, and required the Plaintiff to submit a new default judgment package correcting these defects. Failure to do so may result in sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal. The hearing date is set for December 13, 2023.
