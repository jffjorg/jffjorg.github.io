The ruling is based on the plaintiff's declaration and limited records, which substantiate medical specials in the amount of $8,081.65 and lost income in the amount of $12,000. However, the court reduces the amount of damages awarded due to insufficient evidence to support the plaintiff's claim for general damages and lost earnings. The court also orders the plaintiff to provide notice of this ruling.
