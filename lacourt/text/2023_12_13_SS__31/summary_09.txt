Summary:

The tentative ruling addresses a motion for summary adjudication filed by 200 Pine Avenue, LLC and Riverrock Real Estate Group, Inc. (collectively, "Moving Parties") against Octopus Restaurant Long Beach, Inc. and Automac Parking, Inc. (collectively, "Defendants") regarding the duty to defend in a slip and fall incident that occurred on February 17, 2020. The Moving Parties argue that the duty to defend arises on tender of defense, citing the Restaurant Lease and Parking Agreement. The Court finds that the Restaurant Lease requires Octopus Restaurant to defend 200 Pine Avenue, LLC against claims arising from the underlying tort action, and grants the motion for summary adjudication on this issue. The Court denies the motion for summary adjudication on Automac's duty to defend, as there is no cause of action alleging Automac had any duty to defend 200 Pine Avenue, LLC.
