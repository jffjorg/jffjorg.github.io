And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Hon. Michelle C. Kim, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of David Trujeque and Rosa Trujeque (Plaintiffs) vs. Victory Outreach, Roger Soto, and Jasmine Galvez (Defendants). The Plaintiffs had moved the Court to compel the Defendants to provide further responses to special interrogatories and document requests. The parties had participated in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) on November 9, 2023, and the Court had instructed that the motions would be taken off calendar unless the Plaintiffs informed the Court that the Defendants did not provide further responses. As of December 11, 2023, no party had filed additional information, and the Court has presumed that the issues are resolved and moot. Therefore, the motions to compel further responses are taken off-calendar. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if a party intends to submit on the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the Court by the deadline. If all parties do not submit, they should appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
