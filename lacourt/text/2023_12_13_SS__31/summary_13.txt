And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling sustains the demurrer filed by the defendant, State of California, without leave to amend. The plaintiff, Sharita Randleston, filed a lawsuit against the defendant claiming damages for the death of Asherey Shatonia Ryan, who was killed in an automobile collision caused by Nicole Lorraine Linton. The defendant argued that the complaint fails to state a cause of action for negligence because it does not allege any statutory basis of liability or show that the defendant breached any duty of care to the plaintiff or decedent. The court agrees that the negligence claim against the defendant premised upon Linton's nursing license fails to constitute a cause of action for the automobile collision because the issuance of a nursing license and protection policy in relation thereto is specific to acts or omissions in the rendering of nursing services. The court finds that the plaintiff failed to state a cause of action for negligence and sustains the demurrer.
