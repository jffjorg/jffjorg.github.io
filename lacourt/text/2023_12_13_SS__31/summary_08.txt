And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the request for default judgment in the case of Roza Zadorian vs India Sweets & Spices Chai & Cafe, LLC. The case arises from a trip and fall on August 2, 2021, in the parking lot of the defendant's store. The plaintiff alleges that she fell on an unkempt and uneven patch of asphalt and is seeking $229,737.51 for medical specials and $1,150,000 for general damages for pain and suffering.

However, the Judge has denied the request for default judgment due to several defects in the plaintiff's submissions. First, the plaintiff's declaration is unsigned, and secondly, the plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence of lingering injuries to support the alleged general damages. Additionally, the Judge notes that the plaintiff has used insurance for medical treatment, and therefore, the recovery for past medical expenses will be limited to the amounts actually paid or owed or the reasonable value of the care provided.

The Judge has ordered the plaintiff to submit a new default judgment package correcting these defects by a certain date. Failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal. The OSC re entry of default judgment is continued to a future date.
