And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the dismissal of the case. The plaintiff had previously failed to prosecute the case, and the court had dismissed it on July 3, 2023. The plaintiff then filed a motion to set aside the dismissal, which was denied on October 23, 2023. The plaintiff is now seeking reconsideration, claiming that new facts or circumstances warrant reconsideration. However, the judge finds that none of the contentions made in the motion are supported by evidence, and that the plaintiff still has not demonstrated compliance with the Code of Civil Procedure's requirements for serving defendants. The judge notes that the plaintiff is still represented by counsel, despite filing the motion as a self-represented plaintiff.
