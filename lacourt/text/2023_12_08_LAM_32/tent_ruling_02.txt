      [Tentative]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion for attorney fees 
 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            Plaintiff Miriam Morgado (“Plaintiff”)
commenced this action against Defendants FCA US LLC (“FCA”) on February 24, 2022.   Plaintiff
asserts causes of action under the Song-Beverly Act.  
The Complaint alleges in pertinent part as
follows: On April 25, 2021, Plaintiff purchased a new 2021 Jeep Wrangler (“Vehicle”)
manufactured by FCA.  During the warranty
period the vehicle developed defects.
LEGAL
STANDARD
Attorney’s fees are mandatory to the
prevailing plaintiff under the Song-Beverly Act.   (Kim v.Euromotors West/The Auto Gallery
(2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 170, 178; Drouin
v. Fleetwood Enterprises (1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 486, 493. Pursuant to California
Civil Code, Section 1780(e) : “[t]he court shall award court costs and
attorney’s fees to a prevailing plaintiff in litigation filed pursuant to this
section.” A prevailing plaintiff is someone who has obtained a net monetary
recovery on a Song-Beverly Act.  (Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc.
(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 150.)
 “The
verified time statements of the attorneys, as officers of the court, are
entitled to credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are
erroneous.”  (Horsford v. Board Of Trustees Of California State University (2005)
132 Cal.App.4th 359, 396.)  If the motion
is supported by evidence, the opposing party must respond with specific
evidence showing that the fees are unreasonable.  (Premier
Med. Mgmt. Sys. v. California Ins. Guarantee Ass’n (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th
550, 560-63.)  The Court has discretion
to reduce fees that result from inefficient or duplicative use of time.  (Horsford,
supra, 132 Cal.App.4th at 395.)  
In determining a reasonable attorney fee,
the trial court begins with the lodestar, i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended
multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate. 
(Warren v. Kia Motors America,
Inc. (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 24, 36.) 
The lodestar may then be adjusted based on factors specific to the case
in order to fix the fee at the fair market value of the legal services
provided.  (Ibid.)  These facts include
(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill
displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the
litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent
nature of the fee award.  (Ibid.)
ANALYSIS
            Plaintiff moves for an award of
attorney fees in the amount of $33,220.00 and costs in the amount of $924.20. 
            A.
Entitlement to Attorney Fees
On May 3, 2023, the parties formally
agreed to resolve this action and Defendants stipulated that Plaintiff would be
the “prevailing parties” so that Plaintiff could seek attorney’s fees and costs
by motion.  As such, Plaintiff is the
prevailing party in this action, and as prevailing party in this action,
Plaintiff is entitled to a reasonable amount of attorney fees. The issue to be
addressed is the reasonableness of the requested amount of attorney fees,
costs, and expenses.  
B.
Reasonableness of Fees
1.
Reasonable Hourly Rates
The hourly rates claimed by Plaintiff’s attorneys
to be as follows: (1) Isaac Kohen $535.00 per hour; and (2) Tamara Imber
$285.00 per hour.  
“In determining hourly rates, the court
must look to the ‘prevailing market rates in the relevant community.’”  (Heritage
Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 100.)  In making this determination, “[t]he court
may rely on its own knowledge and familiarity with the legal market.”  (Ibid.) 

The Court finds that Isaac Kohen’s hourly
rate of $450.00 per hour is the reasonable hourly rate in this case.  The Court finds that Tamara Imber’s reasonable
hourly rate in this case is $285.00 per hour. 
  
2.
Hours Reasonably Expended
The total number of billable hours claimed
by Plaintiff’s attorneys are as follows: (1) Isaac Kohen 41 hours; and (2)
Tamara Imber 22 hours.   
            Mercedes claims that the number of
hours billed is unreasonable.  
The Court finds that the reasonable hours
spent by Plaintiff’s attorney Isaac Kohen in this matter are 40 hours. The
Court finds that the reasonable hours spent by Plaintiff’s attorney Tamara
Imber are 25 hours.  
In making this determination, the court
found that some of the billing was excessive, especially for attorneys as experienced
as plaintiff’s counsel. While plaintiff has the right to have multiple
attorneys, the court finds that some of the attorneys’ work was duplicative and
redundant.  
C.
Multiplier 
Plaintiff requested a lodestar multiplier
enhancement.  Defendant did not request a
negative lodestar multiplier.
 The
Court finds that an upward adjustment to the lodestar is not warranted in this
action. This was a straightforward lemon law case.  There is no evidence that Plaintiff’s counsel
was precluded from taking other cases. A downward adjustment to the lodestar is
not warranted either as Plaintiff’s counsel took this case on a contingency.
D.
Entitlement and Reasonableness of Costs
Plaintiff requests a total of $924.20 in costs and expenses.  Defendant does not object to an award of
costs.  
The court finds that Plaintiff is entitled
to an award of $924.20 in costs and expenses.
D.
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing reasons,
Plaintiff’s motion for attorney fees is GRANTED.  The Court awards $24,270.00 in attorney fees
($18,000.00 Isaac Kohen and $6270 Tamara Imber) and $924.20 in costs and expenses.
