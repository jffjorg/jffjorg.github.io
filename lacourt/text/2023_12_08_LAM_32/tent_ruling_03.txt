     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant county of los angeles’ motion
  for judgment on the pleadings 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On June 2, 2022, Plaintiff Angela
Walton initiated this employment action against Defendants County of Los Angeles
and Alexandro Villanueva. The operative pleading is the First Amended Complaint
filed July 11, 2022. The FAC asserts (1) Labor Code retaliation, (2) FEHA
discrimination, (3) FEHA retaliation, and (4) FEHA failure to prevent. 
            Plaintiff is a detention facility captain
employed by the County. (FAC ¶¶ 23, 24.) Plaintiff alleges that Sheriff
Villanueva personally intervened in Plaintiff’s exercise of her duties and
actively undermined Plaintiff’s authority. (Id., ¶ 25.) Plaintiff also
filed a Policy of Equity (“POE”) complaint against her supervisor, Commander
Josie Woolum in August 2021 for harassment. (Id., ¶ 26.) Shortly after,
Plaintiff was demoted and lost her command at the detention center, a decision allegedly
made by Sheriff Villanueva in conjunction with Commander Woolum and other
chiefs. (Ibid.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendants discriminated against
her based on her status as an African-American female. (Id., ¶ 28.)
Plaintiff also alleges retaliation as a result of her serving as a witness
against LASD, complaining about her supervisors’ violations of Civil Service Rules,
and opposing other misconduct. (Id., ¶¶ 29-43.) 
            On November 14, 2023, Defendant
County filed the instant motion for judgment on the pleadings as to Plaintiff’s
first cause of action for whistleblower retaliation. Plaintiff filed her
opposition on November 27, 2023. Defendant filed its reply on December 1, 2023.
   
LEGAL STANDARD
A motion for judgment on the pleadings may
be made on the same grounds as those supporting a general demurrer, i.e., that
the pleading fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a legally cognizable
claim or defense. (Stoops v. Abbassi (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 644, 650.) A
motion for judgment on the pleadings performs the same function as a general
demurrer, and hence attacks only defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings
or by matters that can be judicially noticed. (Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp.
(1999) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999.) Judgment on the pleadings must be denied where
there are material factual issues that require evidentiary resolution. (Schabarum
v. Calif. Legislature (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1205, 1216.)  
DISCUSSION
I.
Claim Presentation Requirement
Under the Government Claims Act, “no suit
for money or damages may be brought against a public entity on a cause of
action for which a claim is required to be presented . . . until a written
claim therefor has been presented to the public entity and has been acted upon
by the board, or has been deemed to have been rejected by the board . . . .” (Gov.
Code, § 945.4.) A plaintiff must file a lawsuit within six months after notice
of the board’s action on their claim. (Id., § 945.6.) “[F]ailure to
allege facts demonstrating or excusing compliance with the claim presentation
requirement subjects a claim against a public entity to a demurrer for failure
to state a cause of action.” (Lowry v. Port San Luis Harbor Dist. (2020)
56 Cal.App.5th 211, 218.) 
 
II.
Plaintiff’s Tort Claim
Here, Plaintiff alleges that she presented
a tort claim to the County on February 8, 2022. (FAC ¶ 21.) On February 18,
2022, Defendant notified Plaintiff that her claim, as it pertained to
activities occurring before August 8, 2021, was being returned due to
untimeliness. (FAC, Ex. 1.) On April 7, 2022, Defendant notified Plaintiff that
her claim, as it pertained to activities since August 9, 2021, had been
rejected for failure to substantially comply with Government Code requirements.
(Ibid.) Plaintiff filed this action on June 2, 2022, within six months
of both notices. 
III.
Defendant’s Argument
Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot proceed
on any claims predating August 9, 2021 because Plaintiff did not bring the
government claim within six months of accrual of the cause of action, leading
Defendant to “return” the claim as untimely rather than “reject” the claim as
required to trigger a right to sue. Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot
proceed on any claims after August 9, 2021 because Plaintiff’s government claim
did not substantially comply with the Act due to a typo regarding the date of injury.

a. Claims Predating August 9, 2021
            “A claim relating to a cause of
action for death or for injury to person . . . shall be presented . . . not
later than six months after the accrual of the cause of action.” (Gov. Code, §
911.2(a).) Defendant argues that because Plaintiff presented her tort claim on
February 9, 2022, six months prior would be August 9, 2021. As a result, Defendant
argues, any claim predating August 9, 2021 is time-barred. 
However, Defendant is only moving to
dismiss the first cause of action for whistleblower retaliation under Labor Code
section 1102.5. Defendant does not explain how that claim accrued prior to
August 9, 2021. Defendant does not point to any allegations in the complaint
that establish, as a matter of law, the claim was “complete with all of its
elements” before August 9, 2021. (See Willis v. City of Carlsbad (2020)
48 Cal.App.5th 1104, 1124.) Additionally, to the extent the retaliation claim
is based on a “pattern of reasonably frequent and similar acts,” the continuing
violation doctrine makes the cause of action accrue on the date of the last
act. (Ibid.) Plaintiff alleges that she was demoted on August 15, 2021.
(FAC ¶ 26.) Therefore, Plaintiff’s retaliation claim was timely presented. 
Defendant also argues that a lawsuit may
not be filed until a presented claim is “rejected,” which did not occur in this
case for the claims predating August 9, 2021, because Defendant “returned” those
claims as untimely. However, the whistleblower claim, the only claim implicated
in this motion, accrued after August 9, 2021 because Plaintiff was not demoted
until August 15, 2021. Defendant acknowledges that it “rejected” the claims accruing
after August 9, 2021. Therefore, Plaintiff has met the prerequisite under
Section 945.4 for bringing the whistleblower claim. 
b. Claims After August 9, 2021
A tort claim presented to a public entity
must contain, inter alia, the following elements: the date, place and
other circumstances of the occurrence; and a general description of the
indebtedness, obligation, injury, damage or loss incurred. (Gov. Code, § 910.)
A claimant only needs to substantially comply with the requirements, meaning “sufficient
information is disclosed on the face of the filed claim ‘to reasonably enable
the public entity to make an adequate investigation of the merits of the claim.’”
(Pacific Tel. & Tel. Co. v. County of Riverside (1980) 106
Cal.App.3d 183, 188.) “The doctrine of substantial compliance, however, ‘cannot
cure total omission of an essential element from the claim or remedy a
plaintiff's failure to comply meaningfully with the statute.’” (Connelly v.
County of Fresno (2006) 146 Cal.App.4th 29, 38.) 
Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s tort
claim fails to substantially comply with the Act because it identifies a future
injury date of August 15, 2022, six months after the claim was filed in
February 2022. The date should have been August 15, 2021, when Plaintiff
was demoted. Defendant contends that the failure to allege a proper date of
injury is a total failure that cannot be saved by substantial compliance
because Plaintiff has omitted the essential requirement to identify an accrued
harm and state the date of injury. Defendant claims that it was “prevented from
conducting an investigation into Ms. Walton’s claims” due to the incorrect
date. (Lewis Decl. ¶ 6.) 
Defendant’s argument is not well-taken. It
is not credible that Defendant was unable to investigate Plaintiff’s claim
simply because of a typo. Despite this minor error, Plaintiff’s claim contained
sufficient information for Defendant to investigate the merits. The context of
the claim and the other allegations made within make clear that the operative
events occurred in 2021. Defendant would have known that it removed Plaintiff
from the detention facility in August 2021. Plaintiff identified an accrued harm
and stated the date of accrual as required. She simply mistyped part of the
date. Defendant cites no authority for the proposition that a simple typo
constitutes a “total omission of an essential element.” 
The claims requirement “should not be
applied to snare the unwary where its purpose has been satisfied.” (Stockett
v. Association of Cal. Water Agencies Joint Powers Ins. Authority (2004) 34
Cal.4th 441, 446.) Defendant’s motion attempts to do just that by dismissing an
entire retaliation claim based on a single typo. The Court finds that Plaintiff’s
tort claim substantially complied with the Government Code. 
CONCLUSION
            Defendant’s motion for judgment on
the pleadings is DENIED.
