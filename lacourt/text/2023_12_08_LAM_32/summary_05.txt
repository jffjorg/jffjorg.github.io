And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Wilshire Law Firm's motions to compel further responses from Plaintiff MARYAM KHANI. The motions relate to Requests for Admission (RFAs) and a Form Interrogatory (FROG) that were filed by Plaintiff in response to Defendant's discovery requests. The judge finds that Plaintiff's objections to the RFAs and FROG are without merit and that further responses are required.

The judge grants Defendant's motions to compel further responses and orders Plaintiff to provide additional responses to the RFAs and FROG within 15 days. The judge also awards sanctions of $1,870 to Defendant and against Plaintiff and Plaintiff's counsel, to be paid within 30 days.
