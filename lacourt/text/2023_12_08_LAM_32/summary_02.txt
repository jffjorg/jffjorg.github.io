And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Plaintiff's motion for attorney fees and costs. The Plaintiff, Miriam Morgado, seeks $33,220.00 in attorney fees and $924.20 in costs and expenses. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff is the prevailing party in the case and is entitled to a reasonable amount of attorney fees. The Judge awards $24,270.00 in attorney fees ($18,000.00 to Isaac Kohen and $6,270.00 to Tamara Imber) and $924.20 in costs and expenses. The Judge finds that the reasonable hourly rates for the attorneys are $450.00 per hour for Isaac Kohen and $285.00 per hour for Tamara Imber. The Judge also finds that the reasonable hours spent by the attorneys in this matter are 40 hours for Isaac Kohen and 25 hours for Tamara Imber. The Judge notes that some of the billing was excessive, especially for attorneys as experienced as plaintiff's counsel, and that some of the attorneys' work was duplicative and redundant.
