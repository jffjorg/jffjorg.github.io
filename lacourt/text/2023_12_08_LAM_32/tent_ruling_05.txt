                        Defendants.
  


 
  Case No.:  22STCV26639
  Hearing Date:  December 8, 2023
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant wilshire law firm’s motions to
  compel further responses 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On August 17, 2022, Plaintiff filed
this legal malpractice action against Defendants Bobby Babak Saadian and Wilshire
Law Firm, PLC. Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint on December
6, 2022, asserting causes of action for (1) legal malpractice, (2) breach of
fiduciary duty, and (3) fraud. 
            On November 8, 2023, Defendant
Wilshire Law Firm filed the instant motions to compel further responses from
Plaintiff as to Requests for Admission and the associated Form Interrogatory
No. 17.1. Plaintiff has not filed an opposition. 
LEGAL STANDARD
            Upon receiving responses to its discovery requests,
the propounding party may move for an order compelling further responses if the
responses are incomplete or evasive, or objections are without merit or too
general. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(a), 2031.310(a), 2033.290(a).) 
 
 
MEET AND CONFER
A motion to compel further must be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration demonstrating an attempt to
resolve the matter informally. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(b)(1), 2031.310(b),
2033.290(b).) The Court finds that Defendant has satisfied the meet and confer
requirement. (See Grassel Decl.)
DISCUSSION
I.
Requests for Admission
There are three RFAs at issue. RFA No. 27
asks Plaintiff to admit that she took no action to investigate the alleged
misconduct until July 2022. RFA No. 28 asks Plaintiff to admit that Plaintiff
filed the complaint on August 17, 2022. RFA No. 33 asks Plaintiff to admit that
she has no evidence that Defendant Saadian breached any duty owed to her. 
            Plaintiff responded to each RFA with
the following: “Objection. The request is vague, ambiguous, and overly broad.
Subject to and without waiving said objection Plaintiff is unable to admit or
deny based on the information currently available. Discovery and investigation
continue.” 
            Plaintiff’s objections are without
merit. The requests are sufficiently clear and particularized to warrant a
response. Plaintiff’s statement that she is unable to answer the RFA does not
comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.220(c). Therefore, further
responses are required for RFA Nos. 27, 28, and 33.
II.
Form Interrogatory No. 17.1
            Plaintiff asserted the same objection
to FROG No. 17.1 as it pertains to RFA Nos. 20, 27, 28, and 33. The objection
is without merit for the same reasons articulated above. 
Therefore,
a further response is required for FROG No. 17.1.
 
 
CONCLUSION
            Defendant Wilshire Law Firm’s
motions to compel further responses are GRANTED. Plaintiff shall provide
further responses to the subject RFAs and FROGs within 15 days. Sanctions are
in the amount of $1,870 (5 hours at $350 and $120 filing fee) awarded to
Defendant and against Plaintiff and plaintiff’s counsel.  Sanctions shall be paid within 30 days.  .
