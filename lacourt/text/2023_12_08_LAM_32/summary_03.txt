* Plaintiff's whistleblower retaliation claim was timely presented.
* Defendant's argument that Plaintiff failed to present government claim within six months of accrual of cause of action is not well-taken.
* Defendant's argument that Plaintiff's tort claim did not substantially comply with Government Code requirements is also not well-taken, as the claim contained sufficient information for Defendant to investigate the merits despite a minor error.
