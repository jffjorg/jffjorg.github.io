[1] There
appears to be no such time requirement for motions to quash deposition notices,
provided for in Code of Civil Procedure § 2025.410, subd. (c), save an implied
provision — by virtue of the proviso that said motion automatically stays the
deposition — that any such motion be served before the deposition begins.


[2] “When it
appears to the satisfaction of the court that the amendment renders it
necessary, the court may postpone the trial, and may, when the postponement
will by the amendment be rendered necessary, require, as a condition to the
amendment, the payment to the adverse party of any costs as may be just.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 473, subd. (a)(2).) 


[3] “The
court may, of its own motion, postpone the trial, if at the time fixed for the
trial the court is engaged in the trial of another action; or if, as provided
in section 473 of this code, an amendment of the pleadings, or the allowance of
time to make such amendment, or to plead, renders a postponement necessary.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 594a.)
