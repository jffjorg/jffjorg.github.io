And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:


The judge's tentative ruling discusses the procedures for filing motions to quash deposition notices. The judge notes that there is no specific time requirement for filing such motions, except that they must be served before the deposition begins. The judge also references California Code of Civil Procedure sections 473 and 594a, which allow for the postponement of trial in certain circumstances, including when an amendment to the pleadings is necessary. The judge intends to postpone the trial and may require the payment of costs to the adverse party if an amendment to the pleadings is necessary.
