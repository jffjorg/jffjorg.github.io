Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the motions filed by the parties. The motions to quash deposition notices and for a protective order are denied, as the case is now at issue with all parties appearing. The motion to compel deposition is also denied, as the probability of prejudice resulting from multiple depositions is now remote. The motion for a trial continuance is granted, as good cause exists for the addition of new parties to the action. No sanctions are awarded, as the motions were filed and opposed with substantial justification.
