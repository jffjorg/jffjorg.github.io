The motion to compel deposition is also denied, as the probability of prejudice resulting from multiple depositions is now remote. The motion for a trial continuance is granted, as good cause exists for the addition of new parties to the action. No sanctions are awarded, as the motions were filed and opposed with substantial justification.

## English Summary 

The judge's tentative ruling grants in part the Plaintiffs' motions to quash deposition notices, for a protective order, and to continue the trial. The motion to continue the trial is granted because several new defendants have recently joined the case, requiring more time for preparation. 

The judge denies the requests for a protective order and to quash the deposition notices. The judge also denies the Defendant's motion to compel depositions, finding that the basis for the Plaintiffs' motions no longer applies since all defendants have appeared.  No sanctions are awarded to either party.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted in part the motions filed by Haley Burnham and Patrick Burnham, the plaintiffs, to quash deposition notices, for a protective order, and to continue the trial. The motion to continue the trial is granted, but the request for a stay, protective order, or order quashing deposition notices is denied. The judge has also denied the motion filed by Mattive Brothers Leasing, Inc., the defendant, to compel the deposition of the plaintiffs. No sanctions are awarded to either party.

The judge's decision is based on the facts that the case was consolidated on August 22, 2022, and new defendants were added, including Muncie Power Products, Inc. The judge notes that Muncie has now appeared in the case and filed a demurrer and motion to strike, which renders the basis for the plaintiffs' request for a protective order moot. The judge also finds that the likelihood of prejudice resulting from multiple depositions is now remote.

The judge's decision is guided by California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.410, 2025.450, 2025.610, 473, and 594a, as well as CRC Rule 3.1332, subd. (d).
