And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied California Capital Insurance Company's (CCIC) motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) against Maple and Dallaswhite. CCIC argued that the jury's verdict was without basis because CCIC had already paid more than the appraised costs and that there was no evidence that Maple actually incurred the costs of the sprinkler system. However, the court found that CCIC's failure to adequately investigate the repairs and expenses and its induction of Maple and Dallaswhite to incur costs for which it now seeks repayment justified the jury's verdict.

Regarding CCIC's motion against Maple, the court found that CCIC's argument that there was no substantial evidence to support the verdict was unpersuasive. The jury had substantial basis for finding that CCIC was liable for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and for unjust enrichment.

Regarding CCIC's motion against Dallaswhite, the court found that CCIC's argument that Dallaswhite's claims were barred because the adjuster lacked authority to contract was unpersuasive. The court also found that CCIC's argument that Dallaswhite was not entitled to claim damages for demobilization and demolition work was unpersuasive.

In summary, the court has denied CCIC's motions for JNOV against Maple and Dallaswhite, and has found that the jury's verdict was supported by substantial evidence.

The judge has denied CCIC's motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict in a case involving sprinkler repair costs and insurance bad faith claims. 

The judge found that the jury had sufficient evidence to support their verdict in favor of both Maple and Dallaswhite.  CCIC had argued that the jury's findings were inconsistent with the evidence and that they were not liable for the full amount awarded because a dispute existed regarding coverage. The judge disagreed, finding the evidence supported the jury's conclusions. 

Specifically, the judge found that CCIC's handling of the claims may have contributed to the need for the repairs in question and that the jury had a basis for rejecting CCIC's counterclaims.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied California Capital Insurance Company's (CCIC) motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict against Maple and Dallaswhite Corporation. CCIC argued that the verdicts in favor of Maple and Dallaswhite were without basis because CCIC had already paid more than the policy required, and because there was no evidence that Maple and Dallaswhite actually incurred the costs for which they were seeking reimbursement. However, the judge found that CCIC's failure to adequately investigate the repairs and expenses, and its failure to pay the appraised costs, were significant factors in the jury's verdicts. The judge also found that the jury's verdicts were supported by the evidence presented at trial, including expert testimony and documentary evidence.

In particular, the judge rejected CCIC's argument that the jury's verdict in favor of Maple was unsupported because CCIC had already paid more than the policy required. The judge found that CCIC's failure to investigate the repairs and expenses, and its failure to pay the appraised costs, contributed to the necessity of the costs for which it now seeks reimbursement.

The judge also denied CCIC's motions as to Dallaswhite, rejecting its arguments that Dallaswhite's claims were barred because the adjuster who ratified the Work Authorization contract lacked authority to contract, and that Dallaswhite was not entitled to claim damages for demobilization and demolition work. The judge found that the evidence presented at trial supported Dallaswhite's claims, and that CCIC's arguments were unpersuasive.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling is a significant defeat for CCIC, and a victory for Maple and Dallaswhite.
