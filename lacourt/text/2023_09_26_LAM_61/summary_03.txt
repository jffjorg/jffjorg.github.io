And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied California Capital Insurance Company's (CCIC) motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) against Maple and Dallaswhite. CCIC argued that the jury's verdict was without basis because CCIC had already paid more than the appraised costs and that there was no evidence that Maple actually incurred the costs of the sprinkler system. However, the court found that CCIC's failure to adequately investigate the repairs and expenses and its induction of Maple and Dallaswhite to incur costs for which it now seeks repayment justified the jury's verdict.

Regarding CCIC's motion against Maple, the court found that CCIC's argument that there was no substantial evidence to support the verdict was unpersuasive. The jury had substantial basis for finding that CCIC was liable for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and for unjust enrichment.

Regarding CCIC's motion against Dallaswhite, the court found that CCIC's argument that Dallaswhite's claims were barred because the adjuster lacked authority to contract was unpersuasive. The court also found that CCIC's argument that Dallaswhite was not entitled to claim damages for demobilization and demolition work was unpersuasive.

In summary, the court has denied CCIC's motions for JNOV against Maple and Dallaswhite, and has found that the jury's verdict was supported by substantial evidence.
