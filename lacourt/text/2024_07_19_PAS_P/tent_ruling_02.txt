rendered, common count-open book account, breach of contract-third party
beneficiary, unjust enrichment, conversion, and negligence,”. (Motion, p. 2.)            The
demurrer is now before the Court. II.        LEGAL STANDARD"A party may amend its
pleading once without leave of the court at any time before the answer,
demurrer, or motion to strike is filed, or after a demurrer or motion to strike
is filed but before the demurrer or motion to strike is heard if the amended
pleading is filed and served no later than the date for filing an opposition to
the demurrer or motion to strike. A party may amend the pleading after the date
for filing an opposition to the demurrer or motion to strike, upon stipulation
by the parties." (Code Civ. Proc., § 472, subd. (a).) "All papers opposing a motion
so noticed shall be filed with the court and a copy served on each party at
least nine court days ... before the hearing." (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005,
subd. (b).) "[T]he filing of an amended complaint moots a motion directed
to a prior complaint." (JKC3H8 v. Colton (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th
468, 477; see also Sylmar Air Conditioning v. Pueblo Contracting Services,
Inc. (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 1049, 1054 ["[t]he filing of [a] first
amended complaint render[s] [a movant's] demurrer moot since "'an
amendatory pleading supersedes the original one, which ceases to perform any
function as a pleading"'" (citations omitted)].) Accordingly, a
"demurrer [directed to the original pleading] should [be] taken off
calendar" when an amended complaint is filed. (People ex rel.
Strathmann v. Acacia Research Corp. (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 487, 506.)
However, this right is limited to the amendment of a complaint initiating an
action into a first amended complaint; otherwise stated, a party cannot amend
an already amended complaint as a matter of course even though a demurrer has
been directed to the operative and already amended pleading. (Hedwall v.
PCMV, LLC (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 564, 572-579.) III.      ANALYSIS            The
demurrer filed by Defendant Lanai Property, LLC against Plaintiff’s original December
8, 2023 complaint is MOOT.            The hearing
on the demurrer was set for July 19, 2024.Nine court days before the hearing,
on July 8, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint.Such a filing was made as a matter
of course. (Code Civ. Proc., § 472, subd. (a).)The FAC superseded the original December 8, 2023, Complaint
and mooted the instant demurrer. (Sylmar Air Conditioning v. Pueblo
Contracting Services, Inc., supra, 122 Cal.App.4th at p. 1054.) IV.       ORDER            Defendant’s
