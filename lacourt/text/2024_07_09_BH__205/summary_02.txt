And here is the English summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies Ford Motor Company's motion for judgment on the pleadings, which sought to dismiss the plaintiff's Song-Beverly Act (SBA) claims. The plaintiff, Cristina Dinulescu, claims that Ford failed to comply with the SBA by not promptly replacing or making restitution for a defective 2018 Ford Mustang. The judge found that the SBA claims are not subject to dismissal, and that Ford's argument that the claims cannot be brought against a manufacturer for a used car is without merit. The judge also denied Ford's request for judicial notice of a 2020 retail installment sales contract, which was not referenced in the complaint. As a result, the judge's ruling allows the plaintiff's SBA claims to proceed.
