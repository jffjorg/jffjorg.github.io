```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion to strike the plaintiff's complaint for two reasons. Firstly, the plaintiff failed to specify the amount of damages sought in the complaint, which is required by California Code of Civil Procedure section 425.10. Secondly, the plaintiff's claim for attorneys' fees is invalid because it is not based on any statutory or contractual provision, and the plaintiff has not alleged the essential elements necessary to justify an award of attorneys' fees under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.

The judge also notes that the plaintiff's malpractice suit seeks recovery for the plaintiff's personal economic interests, rather than to vindicate an important public right, which is the purpose of the private attorney general statute. Therefore, the plaintiff is not entitled to attorneys' fees under section 1021.5.

The judge grants the defendants' motion to strike the plaintiff's prayer for unspecified damages with 20 days' leave to amend and plaintiff's prayer for attorneys' fees without leave to amend.
