And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to seal portions of the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) that refer to a contract with an express confidentiality provision. The contract, known as the Paramount Slate Agreement, was entered into on August 12, 2020, and contains a broad confidentiality provision. The plaintiff claims that the contract was modified as a result of the terms of the Paramount Slate Agreement, and the information contained in the agreement is relevant to the plaintiff's breach of contract claim.

The judge has found that there is an overriding interest in enforcing the confidentiality provision, which outweighs the public's right of access to the information. The judge has also found that there is a substantial probability that the parties' contractually expressed intention to keep the information confidential would be prejudiced if the SAC is not sealed.

The judge has granted the motion to seal the SAC, but has only ordered that the portions of the SAC that contain references to the terms of the Paramount Slate Agreement and the parties' performance (or non-performance) of their obligations arising out of the agreement be sealed. The judge has not ordered that the entire SAC be sealed, but rather has only ordered that the specific information that is subject to the confidentiality provision be redacted.
