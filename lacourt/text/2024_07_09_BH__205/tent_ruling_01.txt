  Case Number:  22SMCV02938    Hearing Date:   July 9, 2024    Dept:  205    Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District  Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205   BRADLEY J. FISCHER,  Plaintiff, v.  NEW REPUBLIC PICTURES, LLC, et al.,   Defendants.    Case No.:  22SMCV02938     Hearing Date:  July 9, 2024   ORDER RE:   PLAINTIFF BRADLEY J. FISCHER’S    MOTION TO FILE SECOND AMENDED    COMPLAINT UNDER SEAL     BACKGROUND This hearing is on Plaintiff Bradley J. Fischer’s motion to seal portions of the Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) that refer to a contract which Plaintiff claims is at the core of the issues raised in the SAC.  That contract contains an express confidentiality provision prohibiting disclosure of the terms of that agreement to third parties.  The Court previously sealed the same materials and information contained in the original Complaint and the First Amended Complaint that are the subject of the instant motion.   LEGAL STANDARD An application to seal must be accompanied by a declaration containing facts sufficient to justify sealing. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 2.551(b)(1).)  Plaintiff has not submitted the declaration explaining the facts which justify sealing.  Notwithstanding, the Court will consider Plaintiff’s motion on the merits.     A court may order records to be filed under seal when the following conditions are met: “(1) [t]here exists an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record[s]; (2) [t]he overriding interest supports sealing the record[s]; (3) [a] substantial probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record[s are] not sealed; (4) [t]he proposed sealing is narrowly tailored; and (5) [n]o less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest.”  (Cal. Rules of Court 2.550(d).) In ruling on a motion to seal, the court must identify (1) the specific information claimed to be entitled to protection from public disclosure, (2) the nature of the harm threatened by disclosure, and (3) any countervailing considerations. (H.B. Fuller Co. v. Doe (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 879, 894.) Therefore, in order to prevail on his or her motion, the moving party must present a specific enumeration of the facts sought to be withheld and the specific reasons for withholding them. (Id. at 904.) The California Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment provides “a right of access to ordinary civil trial and proceedings.” (NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc. v. Superior Court (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178, 1212.)  The court further noted its belief that “the public has an interest, in all civil cases, in observing and assessing the performance of its public judicial system.”  (Id. at 1210.)  There is a presumption of openness in civil court proceedings. (Id. at 1217.)  Therefore, it is up to this Court to determine if that presumption has been overcome. Courts must find compelling reasons, prejudice absent sealing and the lack of less-restrictive means, before ordering filed documents sealed. (Hurvitz v. Hoefflin (2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 1232, 1246; KNBC-TV, 20 Cal.4th at 1208-1209 n. 25; Champion v. Superior Court (1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 777, 787.)   A compelling reason could include the “enforcement of binding contractual obligations not to disclose.”  (KNBC TV, 20 Cal.4th at n. 46; see also Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Superior Court¿(2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1273, 1283 ¿(defendant’s “contractual obligation not to disclose can constitute an overriding interest within the meaning of” the predecessor to¿rule 2.550(d)).)   A proposed sealing must also be narrowly tailored to serve the overriding interest, such as by sealing only portions of pleadings or redacting particular text that refer to the confidential information.  (In re Marriage of Burkle (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 1045, 1052, 1070.)   DISCUSSION The California Supreme Court has recognized that “enforcement of binding contractual obligations not to disclose” may constitute an overriding interest warranting the sealing of records.  (NBC Subsidiary, 20 Cal.4th at n.46.)  Here, the SAC refers to an agreement between Defendant New Republic Pictures, LLC, its affiliate NRP Film Investments II LLC (“NRP”), and Paramount Pictures Corporation dated August 12, 2020 (the “Paramount Slate Agreement”) that contains a very broad confidentiality provision.  The Paramount Slate Agreement is relevant background for Plaintiff’s breach of contract claim as Plaintiff claims the parties’ contract was modified as a result of the terms of the Paramount Slate Agreement.  (See, e.g., SAC ¶¶ 25-28, 35, 36, 42, 46.)   There is an overriding interest in enforcing the Paramount Slate Agreement’s confidentiality provision that overcomes any right of public access to the SAC, which does not relate to any matters of general public concern.  This Court has already accepted that this information merits sealing.  (See Order Granting Motion to Seal dated January 14, 2023; Minute Order dated June 29, 2023.)    There is also a substantial probability that the parties’ contractually expressed intention to keep the information contained in the Paramount Slate Agreement confidential would be prejudiced if the SAC is not sealed.  Absent sealing, the terms of the Paramount Slate Agreement would be revealed to the public, in contravention of the confidentiality provision.    Finally, the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored, and no less restrictive means exists to achieve the overriding interest, as Plaintiff has proposed to only redact those portions of the SAC containing references to the terms of the Paramount Slate Agreement and the parties’ performance (or non-performance) of their obligations arising out of the Paramount Slate Agreement. CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to seal portions of the SAC.   IT IS SO ORDERED.  DATED: July 9, 2024    ___________________________ Edward B.
