This is a tentative ruling by Judge Thomas D. Long in a case between Trevor Phillips (plaintiff) and Yeezy LLC, et al., et al. (defendants). The defendants' counsel, Brian Brumfield, has filed a motion to be relieved as counsel due to the defendants terminating the attorney-client relationship on June 21, 2024, and refusing to pay counsel. The court has decided to deny the motion unless counsel provides a complete and amended proposed order including the defendants' current or last known phone number. The court also intends to set an Order to Show Cause Re: Failure to Retain New Counsel for Yeezy LLC because a corporation cannot represent itself in court.
