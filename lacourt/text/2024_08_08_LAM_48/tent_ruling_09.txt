[TENTATIVE] ORDER CONTINUING DEMURRER
  AND MOTION TO STRIKE 
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
August 8, 2024



 
On May 24, 2023, Plaintiff Maggie
Parsons filed this action against Defendants Robert Ozeran and Law Offices of Robert
Ozeran Inc.
On
November 9, 2023, Defendants/Cross-Complainants filed a cross-complaint,
alleging (1) fraud – intentional misrepresentation; (2) fraud – concealment;
(3) intentional infliction of emotional distress (“IIED”); (4) negligence; (5)
common law appropriation of name; and (6) appropriation of name under the Civil
Code.
On
November 27, 2023, Parsons filed a demurrer and motion to strike.
Parsons’s
requests for judicial notice of the Petition for Nullity and a July 31, 2024
order in the family law case In re: Marriage of Ozeran and Parsons, Case
No. 23CHFL00714 (“Dissolution Action”) are granted.
The
cross-complaint’s first four causes of action arise from Parsons’s alleged
false representation that Ozeran was baby Roman’s biological father.  (See Cross-Complaint ¶¶ 40-44, 51-55, 60, 67.)  Parsons argues that res judicata and
collateral estoppel bar these causes of action because the same issue is being
decided through the Petition for Nullity in the Dissolution Action.  (Demurrer at pp. 5-6.)
A
trial was held in the Dissolution Action, and on July 31, 2024, the judge took
the matter under submission.  (Parsons
Reply RJN.)  The forthcoming Statement of
Decision may necessarily decide the issue of Parsons’s alleged fraud.  Accordingly, the Court will continue the
motions here until after there is a final judgment on the merits in the Dissolution
Action.
The
parties are ordered to appear for the hearing and be prepared to suggest a
timeline for the continued hearing and supplemental briefing on res
judicata/collateral estoppel.
The
Hearing on Demurrer - without Motion to Strike to Cross-Complaint is CONTINUED
to _____________________.
The
parties may file supplemental briefing on res judicata/collateral estoppel no later
than 10 days before the hearing.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
