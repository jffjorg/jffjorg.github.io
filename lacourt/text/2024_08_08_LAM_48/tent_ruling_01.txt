  CASE NO.: 20STCV36335
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR LEAVE
  TO AMEND COMPLAINT
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
August 8, 2024



 
On September 23, 2020, Plaintiff Virginia F. Ambriz filed
this action.  Some Defendants have answered,
some have defaulted, and some have been dismissed.  On July 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion for
leave to file a first amended complaint (“FAC”).
The
Court may, in its discretion and after notice to the adverse party, allow an amendment
to any pleading.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (a)(1).)  A motion to amend a pleading
must include a copy of the proposed amendment or amended pleading which must be
serially numbered to differentiate it from previous pleadings or amendments and
must state what allegations in the previous pleading are proposed to be deleted
or added, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the allegations
are located.  (California Rules of Court,
rule 3.1324(a).)  The motion shall also be
accompanied by a declaration attesting to the effect of the amendment, why the amendment
is necessary and proper, when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were
discovered, and why the request for amendment was not made earlier.  (California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(b).)  The Court does not ordinarily consider the validity
of the proposed amended pleading when determining whether to grant leave to amend.  (Kittredge Sports Co. v. Superior Court
(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1048.)
Plaintiff
identifies the amendments and provides a copy of the proposed FAC.  Plaintiff seeks to remove a defendant and claim
that has settled, correct names of defendants, clarify the alleged conduct for each
defendant, and add one related cause of action. 
(See Boortz Decl. ¶¶ 4-5, 8.)  Counsel
recently realized that the Complaint does not make specific allegations against
the now-named and defaulted Doe Defendants. 
(Boortz Decl. ¶¶ 6-7.)  Trial has not
yet been set.  No oppositions were filed.
Because
there is no showing of prejudice, the motion for leave to amend the complaint is
GRANTED.  Plaintiff is ordered to file her
FAC within ten days.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
