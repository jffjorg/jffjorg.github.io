  CASE NO.: 22STCV38317
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER REGARDING MOTION TO BE
  RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
August 8, 2024



 
Vip
Bhola, counsel of record for Defendant Sahara Construction Co. Inc., seeks to be
relieved as counsel.  Counsel’s declaration
states that there has been a complete breakdown of the attorney-client relationship,
making further representation difficult and/or impossible.  No party opposed the motion.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motion
complies with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.
“[A]
corporation cannot represent itself in a court of record either in propria persona
or through an officer or agent who is not an attorney.”  (Caressa Camille, Inc. v. Alcoholic Beverage
Control Appeals Bd. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.)  The Final Status Conference is scheduled for September
3, 2024, and trial is scheduled for September 16, 2024.  Leaving Defendant without counsel and unable to
defend this action on the eve of trial is prejudicial to Defendant.  However, the Court recognizes that no oppositions
were filed.
The
parties are ordered to appear for this hearing. 
No further tentative ruling will be issued.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
