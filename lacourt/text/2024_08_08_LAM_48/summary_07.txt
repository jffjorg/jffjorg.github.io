And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to bifurcate issues related to the legality of the defendant's repurchase request under the Song-Beverly Act. The plaintiff seeks a bench trial on four specific issues: the defendant's pre-litigation letter conditioning a repurchase on the plaintiff waiving other rights and potential claims outside of the Song-Beverly Act, conditioning a repurchase on the condition of the vehicle, conditioning a repurchase on an illegal confidentiality agreement, and deducting of negative equity. The defendant does not oppose bifurcation. The judge orders counsel to appear at the hearing to discuss whether additional evidence and testimony are needed or if the issues can be decided based on the existing briefing. The motion to bifurcate is GRANTED.
