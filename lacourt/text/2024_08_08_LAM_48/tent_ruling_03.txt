[TENTATIVE] ORDER SUSTAINING DEMURRER
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
August 8, 2024



 
On
March 27, 2023, Plaintiffs Ricky Millan, Silvia Millan, Michael Millan, Samantha
Millan, and Tommy Millan filed a first amended complaint (“FAC”).  The FAC alleges (1) negligence – premises liability;
(2) negligence per se; (3) negligent hiring; (4) negligent infliction of emotional
distress; (5) unjust enrichment; (6) nuisance; (7) breach of contract; (8) breach
of the covenant of quiet enjoyment; (9) unfair business practices; and (10) fraudulent
concealment.
On
March 26, 2024, Plaintiffs identified Doe 3 as Defendant Milner Roofing Inc.
On
July 8, 2024, Defendant filed a demurrer.
DISCUSSION
A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740,
747.)  When considering demurrers, courts
read the allegations liberally and in context, accepting the alleged facts as true.  (Nolte v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (2015)
236 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1406.)  “Because a demurrer
challenges defects on the face of the complaint, it can only refer to matters outside
the pleading that are subject to judicial notice.”  (Arce ex rel. Arce v. Kaiser Found. Health
Plan, Inc. (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 471, 556.)
A.        Defendant’s Request for Judicial Notice
is Granted.
Plaintiffs
argue that the demurrer “is based solely on impermissible use of extrinsic evidence,
an unsigned, unauthenticated paper (see Defendant’s Demurrer) which must
not be considered.”  (Opposition at p. 4.)  The “unsigned, unauthenticated paper” is a copy
of the Trust Transfer Deed recorded on May 23, 2018 as document number 20180509199.
The
Court may take judicial notice of “the existence and recordation of real property
records, including deeds of trust, when the authenticity of the documents is not
challenged,” as well as “a variety of matters that can be deduced from the documents.”  (Fontenot v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2011)
198 Cal.App.4th 256, 264-265.)  “[A] court
may take judicial notice of the fact of a document’s recordation, the date the document
was recorded and executed, the parties to the transaction reflected in a recorded
document, and the document’s legally operative language, assuming there is no genuine
dispute regarding the document’s authenticity. 
From this, the court may deduce and rely upon the legal effect of the recorded
document, when that effect is clear from its face.”  (Id. at p. 265.)
The
request for judicial notice is granted to the extent explained above.
B.        The Deed Does Not Show that Defendant
Lacks Any Interest in the Property.
Defendant
argues that it did not own, possess, or control the property.  (See Demurrer at p. 7.)  The Trust Transfer Deed reflects a conveyance
of real property from “JOAN H. PLOTKIN, Trustee of the PLOTKIN TRUST AGREEMENT dated
August 28, 1991” to “JOAN H. PLOTKIN, Trustee of the SURVIVOR’S TRUST under the
PLOTKIN TRUST AGREEMENT dated August 28, 1991” on May 16, 2018.  
The
legal effect of the Deed is a transfer of the property on May 16, 2018.  It does not show that Defendant had no interest
in the property at any time thereafter until the September 5, 2020 fire.
The
demurrer is overruled on this ground.
C.        Plaintiffs’ Negligence Causes of Action
Are Duplicative.
Defendant
argues that the causes of action for negligence per se (second cause of action),
negligent hiring (third cause of action), and negligent infliction of emotional
distress (fourth cause of action) are duplicative of the first cause of action for
negligence.  (Demurrer at pp. 7-89)  Plaintiffs’ first four cases of action all allege
different theories of negligence and should be combined into a single cause of action
for negligence.
The
demurrer is sustained on this ground.
D.        There Are No Facts About Defendant’s Conduct.
Defendant
argues that there are no allegations about its involvement in any wrongdoing or
any relationship with Plaintiffs.  (See Demurrer
at pp. 7-14.)
Plaintiffs
sued Joan Plotkin and Doe Defendants, and they later identified Defendant as Doe
3.  The allegations that all Does are responsible
for Plaintiffs’ harm and that they are “the agents, servants, employees, and/or
joint venturers of their co-defendants” are conclusory and lack facts.  (FAC ¶¶ 7-8.)
Each
cause of action is brought against “All Defendants.”  However, Plaintiffs specifically seek “equitable
relief, monetary and punitive damages against Defendant JOAN PLOTKIN, a California
landlord.”  (FAC ¶ 1.)  The “landlords” failed to properly fix the roof,
the absence of a swamp cooler caused an electrical fire, and “the negligence and
lack of care by the landlord caused this situation which led to the fire.”  (See, e.g., FAC ¶¶ 19, 24, 27; 31, 35, 40.)  The lack of maintenance, the poor conditions,
and the fire gave rise to all of Plaintiffs’ damages.  (See, e.g., FAC ¶ 50, 62, 69, 77, 85, 97.)  There are no specific facts about Defendant’s
involvement.
The
demurrer to all causes of action is sustained on this ground.
CONCLUSION
Defendant
Milner Roofing Inc.’s demurrer is SUSTAINED with 30 days’ leave to amend.
On
January 11, 2024, the Court sustained Joan Plotkin’s demurrer to the third, fourth,
fifth, seventh, and tenth causes of action with 30 days’ leave to amend.  Plaintiffs did not timely file an amended complaint.  Joan Plotkin then filed an answer to the remainder
of the FAC on March 7, 2024.  Accordingly,
this order’s grant of leave to amend is limited to the allegations about demurring
Defendant Milner Roofing Inc.
