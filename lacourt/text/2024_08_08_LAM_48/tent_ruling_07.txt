  CASE NO.: 22STCV40227
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO BIFURCATE
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
August 8, 2024



 
On
July 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to bifurcate issues relating to the legality
of Defendant FCA US LLC’s repurchase request under the Song-Beverly Act.
Plaintiff
seeks a bench trial on the following issues: (1) Defendant’s pre-litigation letter
conditioning a repurchase on Plaintiff waiving other rights and potential claims
outside of the Song-Beverly Act; (2) Defendant’s pre-litigation letter conditioning
a repurchase on the condition of the vehicle; (3) Defendant’s pre-litigation letter
conditioning a repurchase on an illegal confidentiality agreement; and (4) Defendant’s
pre-litigation letter deducting of negative equity.  Defendant does not oppose bifurcating the trial
in this manner.  (See generally Opposition.)
The
Court may order a separate trial of any cause of action or any separate issue in
furtherance of convenience or when separate trials will be conducive to expedition
and economy.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1048, subd.
(b).)  The Court may also order the trial
of an issue to precede the trial on another issue.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 598.)
The
motion to bifurcate is GRANTED.
Counsel
is ordered to appear at the hearing to discuss whether there needs to be additional
evidence and testimony in a bench trial on the current trial date of November 25,
2024, or whether the issues can be decided based on the existing briefing.
