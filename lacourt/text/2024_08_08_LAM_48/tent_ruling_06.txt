  CASE NO.: 22STCV38777
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO BE RELIEVED
  AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
August 8, 2024



 
Noah
Green, counsel of record for Plaintiff Bikram Sheenh, seeks to be relieved as counsel.  Counsel’s declaration states that there are irreconcilable
differences regarding the handling of the case. 
No party opposed the motion.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motion
complies with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  After counsel filed this motion, counsel represented
to the Court that the case has settled, so there is no prejudice to Plaintiff.
The
proposed order no longer contains accurate information about the next scheduled
hearing.  The Court will correct this information
before signing the order.
The
unopposed motion to be relieved is GRANTED and effective upon filing a proof of
service showing service of the signed Form MC-053 order and this order on Bikram
Sheenh and all parties who have appeared.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
 
        
Dated this 8th day of August 2024
