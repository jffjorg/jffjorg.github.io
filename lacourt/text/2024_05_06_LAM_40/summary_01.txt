And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion to be relieved as counsel for Allyson K. Thompson & Laura P. Birnbaum is continued to July 9, 2024. The court needs greater clarity as to proof of service of the notice and motion on all parties in the action, as well as the reasons for the withdrawal. The court also notes that the record is unclear as to whether the motion is opposed, and if so, on what grounds. The court suggests that defense counsel file amended papers rather than errata notices in relation to the motion to be relieved as counsel for Defendant Michael Florman.
