Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendant Equity Residential Management, LLC (ERM) to the Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint. The Court finds in favor of ERM, sustaining its demurrer with leave to amend. The Court determines that the First Amended Complaint fails to allege an invasion of privacy that is so serious in nature as to be highly offensive to a reasonable person. The Court concludes that the Plaintiffs' allegations do not constitute a serious invasion of privacy that is highly offensive to a reasonable person going through a rental application process with full knowledge that submitting the application involves consent to the landlord obtaining consumer reports regarding the applicants.
