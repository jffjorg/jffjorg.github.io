BACKGROUND
 
On January 17, 2020, petitioner Hudock
Employment Law Group (“Petitioner”) commenced this action by filing its
petition to confirm contractual arbitration award. The petition arises from
petitioner’s dispute with respondents Celebrity HomeHealth, Inc. and David
Bustan (collectively “Respondents”), involving unpaid legal services in an
employment law matter. (Petition, ¶ 5.) The arbitrator awarded a total amount
of $69,360.62 to Petitioner. (Petition, ¶ 8b(1).) 
 
On August 12, 2021, the court granted Petitioner’s
petition to confirm arbitration award and awarded petitioner attorney’s fees
and costs in the reduced amount of $1,942.50 and interest in the amount of
$9,880. (Minute Order 08/12/21.) 
 
On September 3, 2021, the court ordered
judgment entered for Petitioner against Respondents in this matter in the total
amount of $81,183.12, based on $69,360.62 in damages, $9,880.00 in prejudgment
interest, $1,275.00 in attorney fees, and 667.50 in costs. (Minute Order
09/03/21.) 
 
The Court of Appeal remanded this matter
for an evidentiary hearing to determine
whether a valid arbitration contract exists between Petitioner and Celebrity
HomeHealth, Inc. (“Respondent”). 
 
On September 12, 2024, the court denied
Petitioner’s petition to confirm arbitration award against respondent Celebrity
HomeHealth, Inc., finding no arbitration agreement exists between the two
parties. The Court affirmed judgment as to respondent David Bustan. (Minute
Order 09/12/24.) 
 
On September 30, 2024, Respondent filed its
memorandum of costs, requesting $952.85 for filing and motion fees, $489.53 for
service of process, $2,990.00 for court reporter fees as established by
statute, $134.12 for models, enlargements, and photocopies of exhibits, $741.15
for electronic filing or service fees, and $8,230.76 for other fees, for a
total amount of $13,538.41. The memorandum of costs provides attorney fees will
be determined by motion.  
 
On October 16, 2024, Petitioner filed
its motion to tax and strike costs in response to Respondent’s memorandum of
costs. On December 31, 2024, Respondent filed its opposition, and on January 7,
2025, Petitioner filed its reply. 
 
On November 8, 2024, Respondent filed
its motion for attorneys’ fees, to which Plaintiff opposed on December 31, 2024,
and which Respondent replied on January 7, 2025. 
 
Both motions are set for hearing on
January 14, 2025. 
 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 

Respondent
     Celebrity HomeHealth, Inc.’s motion for attorney fees is granted in the
     reduced total amount of $63,000. 

 

Petitioner Hudock Employment Law Group’s
     motion to tax and strike costs is granted in the reduced total amount of
     $3,942.85. Respondent Celebrity HomeHealth, Inc. is therefore entitled to
     costs in the reduced amount of $9,595.56. 

 
 
1.      MOTION FOR ATTORNEYS’ FEES FILED BY RESPONDENT
CELEBRITY HOMEHEALTH, INC. ON 11/08/24 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
Code of Civil
Procedure Section 1293.2, which pertains to arbitration proceedings, provides
that the court “shall” award costs for judicial proceedings as provided in
Chapter 6 of the Code. A petition to compel arbitration is a judicial
proceeding. (Otay River Constructors v. San Diego Expressway (2008) 158
Cal. App. 4th 796, 805.) Code of Civil Procedure Section 1033.5, which is in
Chapter 6, in turn provides that costs recoverable by a prevailing party
include filing and motion fees, service fees, and attorney’s fees, when
authorized by contract. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(a)(1), (4), (10); see also
id., § 1032.) 
 
In addition, “[i]n
any action on a contract, where the contract specifically provides that
attorney's fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract, shall
be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then the
party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract, whether he
or she is the party specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to
reasonable attorney's fees in addition to other costs.” (Civ. Code
§1717(a).)  
 
“[T]he fee
setting inquiry in California ordinarily begins with the lodestar, i.e., the
number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.
California courts have consistently held that a computation of time spent on a
case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a determination of
an appropriate attorneys’ fee award.” (PLCM Grp. v. Drexler (2000) 22
Cal 4th 1084, 1095.) The reasonable hourly rate is the prevailing rate for
similar work in the community. (Ibid.) “The lodestar figure may then be
adjusted, based on consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to
fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services provided.” (Ibid.)   
 
In determining
whether to adjust the lodestar figure, the court may consider the nature and
difficulty of the litigation, the amount of money involved, the skill required
and employed to handle the case, the attention given, the success or failure,
and other circumstances in the case. (EnPalm LLC v. Teitler (2008)
162 Cal.App.4th 770, 774.) 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
Respondent requests
an order awarding it attorneys’ fees in the amount of $74,585 for successfully
defeating Petitioner’s petition
to confirm the arbitration award and for this motion for attorneys’ fees and
costs. Respondent argues it is entitled to a mandatory award of attorneys’ fees
under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1293.2 and 1033.5. Respondent is also
able to recover its fees under Civil Code section 1717 because it is the
prevailing party and because the contract Petitioner sought to enforce contains
a fees provision. Respondent’s counsel is entitled to a blended hourly rate of
$350, and the 213.1 hours expended were reasonable. 


Petitioner
asks the court to deny the motion, arguing that respondent is not entitled to
recovery of attorneys’ fees for the proceedings prior to and including the
appeal pursuant to the at-issue fee agreement. Further, respondent has not met
its burden of proof to establish the fees incurred are reasonable and not
excessive. 
 
Prevailing
Party 
 
Here, Petitioner’s
argument that respondent is not entitled to recovery of attorneys’ fees
pursuant for the proceedings prior to and including the appeal is meritless as
it is not supported by law or the at-issue fee agreement, which states:
 
If the firm must make any efforts or institute any
type of action to collect past due payments of fees and costs owed to the firm
under this agreement, the prevailing party in that collection matter shall be
entitled to reimbursement for all attorney fees and costs incurred in
connection with such proceedings….
 
(Opp., p. 6.) Based
on foregoing fee agreement, Petitioner argues there were, at minimum, four
“proceedings”: (1) the arbitration; (2) the petition to confirm arbitration;
(3) the appeal; and (4) the evidentiary hearing. (Opp., p. 7.) If any fees are
deemed to be recoverable by Respondent, then such fees would be limited to the
evidentiary hearing. (Ibid.) The court finds Petitioner’s argument
unpersuasive and declines to parse out the action into separate “proceedings” and
separate prevailing party analysis. In this case, the petition to confirm
arbitration award was initially granted in Petitioner’s favor; however, the
Court of Appeal remanded this matter to hold an evidentiary hearing to
determine whether a valid arbitration contract exists between Petitioner and Respondent.
Ultimately, on September 12,
2024, the court denied Petitioner’s petition to confirm arbitration award
against Respondent, finding no arbitration agreement exists between the two
parties. The Court affirmed judgment as to respondent David Bustan. Therefore, Respondent
is the prevailing party in this proceeding entitled to recover its reasonable
attorneys’ fees pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure Section 1293.2. 
 
Reasonable
Attorneys’ Fees
 
Respondent requests attorneys’ fees of $74,585, based on a blended hourly
rate of $350 and the 213.1 hours expended. 
 
Petitioner does not contest the blended
hourly rate of $350 sought, as Petitioner’s opposition fails to address it entirely.
Therefore, the court finds the blended hourly rate charged by Respondent’s
counsel reasonable. 


Respondent’s
attorneys billed a total of 213.1 hours in connection with this action.
(Declaration of Griffin Schindler, ¶ 2–14, Ex. 1–2; Declaration of David Bustan,
¶ 3–4.) Respondent provides the following chart:

(Motion, p. 14.)

 
Petitioner
argues the fees sought by Respondent are unreasonable based on the Appellate
Court order stating that the parties are to bear their own costs, the
significant litigation created by Respondents, and unreasonable apportionment. 
 
First, the
Court of Appeal’s opinion stated that the parties are to bear their own costs,
however it was silent as to fees. (10/18/22 Appellate Court Opinion.) Second,
Petitioner’s argument that Respondents—Celebrity HomeHealth, Inc. and David
Bustan—created excessive litigation by using delay tactics is unpersuasive as
it is conclusory, and Petitioner’s statements against respondent David Bustan
are not relevant as respondent David Bustan is not a party to this attorneys’
fees motion. Further, Petitioner fails to acknowledge the complexity of this
case given the appeal and two-day evidentiary hearing. Lastly, the court
declines to reduce fees via apportionment as Petitioner fails to account for
the reality that certain costs would have been the same, especially in light of
Petitioner’s decision to jointly bring this action against Respondents. 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the court
will reduce the fee request by $5,005.00 in connection with the Motion to
Vacate Judgment, which Respondent withdrew on November 22, 2023. The court will
also reduce the fee request by $12,250 for
work incurred by Respondent’s former counsel Donna Leung as Ms. Leung never
provided her own declaration in support of the motion. The court will also
reduce the fee request by $1,400 for work incurred by Jonathan Kent for the
same reason as above. 
 
On November
25, 2024, Respondent’s counsel filed a supplemental declaration in support of
this motion, wherein counsel represents that an additional 20.2 hours in this
matter have been reduced to an invoice since the filing of this motion. (Supplemental
Declaration of Griffin Schindler, ¶ 3, Ex. 3.) The invoice reflects 2.4 hours
performed by James Decker and 17.8 hours performed by Griffin Schindler, which,
multiplied by $350 per hour, results in a total of $7,070, bringing the total
fee sought to $81,655 ($74,585 and $7,070). (Ibid.)
Petitioner does not contest the $7,070 as the opposition fails to address it. 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
Accordingly,
the motion for attorneys’ fees is granted in the reduced total amount of $63,000.

                 
 
2.      MOTION TO TAX/STRIKE COSTS FILED BY
PLAINTIFF/PETIONER HUDOCK EMPLOYMENT LAW GROUP ON 10/16/24
 
LEGAL STANDARD 
 
“[T]he prevailing party in a lawsuit is
entitled as a matter of right to recover allowable costs under [Code of Civil
Procedure] section 1032, subdivision (b) which provides ‘… (b) Except as
otherwise expressly provided by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a
matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding.’” (Seever v.
Copley Press, Inc. (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1550, 1557.) If the items on a
verified memorandum of costs appear to be proper charges, they are prima facie
evidence that the costs listed were necessarily incurred. (Ibid.) “[I]t
is not enough for the losing party to attack submitted costs by arguing that he
thinks the costs were not necessary or reasonable.” (Ibid.) “Rather, the
losing party has the burden to present evidence and prove that the claimed
costs were not recoverable.” (Ibid. [emphases added[; see also Jones
v. Dumrichob (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1258, 1266 [denying motion to tax costs
where “[n]o counter-declarations or other rebuttal documents were proffered by
appellants to support factually the conclusory challenge to the necessity of
the items in question”); Rappenecker v. Sea-Land Service, Inc. (1979) 93
Cal.App.3d 256, 266 [“Defendant’s mere statements in the points and authorities
accompanying its notice of motion to strike cost bill and the declaration of
its counsel are insufficient to rebut the prima facie showing.”].)
 
DISCUSSION
 
On September 30, 2024, Respondent filed
its memorandum of costs, requesting $952.85 for filing and motion fees, $489.53
for service of process, $2,990.00 for court reporter fees, $134.12 for models,
enlargements, and photocopies of exhibits, $741.15 for electronic filing or
service fees, and $8,230.76 for other fees, for a total amount of $13,538.41.
The memorandum of costs provides attorney fees will be determined by
motion.  
 
Petitioner requests an order to tax and
strike costs, arguing that the memorandum of costs filed on September 30, 2024
is unreasonable, unauthorized, vague, and Respondent appears to seek the
unpermitted costs of respondent David Bustan, who was not determined to be a
prevailing party.
 
In opposition, Respondent does not
dispute the timeliness of Petitioner’s motion. 
Instead, Respondent argues that the motion should be denied as its
verified Memorandum of Costs is prima facie evidence and the costs were
reasonably and necessarily incurred in its defense against Petitioner’s
enforcement of the arbitration agreement. 
 
The court finds that Respondent’s verified
memorandum of costs, together with the declarations of Respondent’s counsel Griffin
Schindler and respondent David Bustan, constitute prima face evidence that the
costs listed were necessarily incurred. Contrary to Petitioner’s argument, Respondent
is not required to set forth receipts. Further, Petitioner has presented no
evidence to substantiate its claims that “[Celebrity HomeHealth, Inc.] and
Bustan appear to merge their purported claims of costs.” (Motion, p. 6.)  As set forth above, “it is not enough for the
losing party to attack submitted costs by arguing that he thinks the costs were
not necessary or reasonable.” (Seever v. Copley Press, Inc. (2006) 141
Cal.App.4th 1550, 1557.)
 
Nonetheless, the Court strikes the
following costs under C.C.P.  1033.5(c)(2)
and (3): 
 
1)     
Appellate
filing fees of $891.20 ($116.20 plus $775.00) under Item 1, as the Appellate
Court ordered, “the parties are to bear their own costs on appeal.” (10/18/22 Appellate
Court Opinion.)
2)     
Motion
to Vacate filing fee of $61.65 under Item 1, as the motion was withdrawn. (11/22/23
Notice of Withdrawal.)
3)     
Court
reporter fees of $2,990.00 under Item 11, as there is no statutory basis for
such fees. (Code Civ. Proc. §1033.5, subd. (a)(11).)
4)     
Travel
costs in the amount of $6585.38 under item 16, as there is no statutory basis
for such costs and they are neither justified nor reasonable.
5)     
Transcript
costs of $1338.10, as they were not ordered by the court and are not otherwise
permitted by statute.   
 
CONCLUSION
 
Thus, Petitioner’s motion to tax/strike
costs is granted in the reduced total amount of $11,866.33. Respondent
Celebrity HomeHealth, Inc. is therefore entitled to costs in the reduced amount
of $1672.08.
