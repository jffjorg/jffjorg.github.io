And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a dispute over a commercial property lease. The plaintiffs, Hany Hegazy, Taha Deif, Moustafa Ahmed Shokr, and TMH, LLC, filed a complaint against the defendants, Giang Hong, Hai Hong, and Suong Thi Trinh, alleging that the defendants agreed to lease the property to them and that they spent $70,000 building out the property. However, the plaintiffs were unable to obtain permits to operate their intended mini-market and smoke shop due to zoning issues.

The defendants filed a demurrer to the complaint, arguing that it was insufficient to support the causes of action. The judge has determined that the demurrer will be continued for one month, and that the parties must engage in meet and confer efforts to resolve their differences. The judge has also ordered the parties to file meet and confer declarations and briefs detailing which issues were resolved and which remain to be decided.

The judge's tentative ruling highlights the importance of meet and confer efforts in resolving disputes, and emphasizes the need for parties to engage in constructive communication to resolve their differences.
