Summary:
--------

The tentative ruling is for a court hearing on October 3, 2023, in Department S27. The case involves Plaintiffs Hany Hegazy, Taha Deif, Moustafa Ahmed Shokr, and TMH, LLC who filed a complaint against Defendants Giang Hong, Hai Hong, and Suong Thi Trinh on February 10, 2022. The complaint includes causes of action for conversion, fraud and deceit, breach of written lease contracts, and breach of oral contract. The Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants agreed to lease commercial property to them and represented that the property was zoned for their intended use. However, the Plaintiffs spent $70,000 building out the property but were unable to obtain permits to operate their intended mini-market and smoke shop because the premises were not zoned for such use.

A demurrer was filed by Trinh, which is a pleading used to test the legal sufficiency of other pleadings. The legal standard on demurrer is that it raises issues of law, not fact, and is not used to challenge the truthfulness of the complaint. For the purposes of the ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are assumed to be true, however improbable they may be. A demurrer can only be used to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable.

Before filing a demurrer, the demurring party must meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer. The parties are to meet and confer at least five days before the date the responsive pleading is due.

In this case, Defense Counsel sent a meet and confer email, but Plaintiffs never responded. The Court will require Counsel to engage in the required meet and confer efforts before it rules on this demurrer. The hearing on the demurrer is continued for one month, to Tuesday, 11/07/23 at 8:30 a.m. in Department S27. Counsel are ordered to meet and confer forthwith. If Counsel are unable to come to agreement concerning the issues presented on demurrer, the attorneys for both sides must file meet and confer declarations at least two weeks prior to the continued hearing date. The parties must also file short briefs detailing which issues were resolved and which issues remain to be decided at the hearing by October 31, 2023. Defendants are ordered to give notice.
