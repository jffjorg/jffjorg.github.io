## English Text Summary

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a case involving a landlord (FK Realty, LLC) and a tenant (Keystone Industries LBC, LLC). 

The tenant filed a lawsuit claiming they have a valid lease assignment, while the landlord is seeking to evict them. The judge previously ruled against the tenant's attempt to add other legal claims to the lawsuit, leaving only the forcible detainer claims in play.

The landlord also filed a motion to remove a "lis pendens," a notice that a lawsuit is pending, which can impact property ownership. The judge initially denied this motion because the landlord did not properly file a prior judgment in a separate unlawful detainer case that would have covered all occupants of the property.

The judge found that due to errors made by the landlord when filling out forms for the prior judgment, it did not apply to all tenants.  Therefore, the lis pendens remains in place.


The judge scheduled a case management conference to discuss the case further.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to expunge lis pendens in the case of Keystone Industries LBC, LLC v. Fred Kazemi, et al. The plaintiff, Keystone Industries LBC, LLC, filed a complaint for forcible detainer against the defendants, Fred Kazemi, Cary Alexander, and FK Realty, LLC. The defendants responded with demurrers, and the plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint that included additional causes of action. The Court struck the First Amended Complaint, finding that the inclusion of the additional causes of action was improper in a forcible detainer action.

The defendants then filed a motion to expunge lis pendens, arguing that the plaintiff's claim was not valid and that the lis pendens should be removed. The plaintiff opposed the motion, arguing that the defendants had not established that the plaintiff's claim was not valid. The Court found that the defendants had not met their burden of proof and denied the motion to expunge.

The Court also found that the defendants had made errors in filling out the forms for the prior UD judgment, which resulted in the judgment not being entered against all tenants, subtenants, named claimants, and other occupants of the premises. The Court denied the motion to expunge, finding that the plaintiff's claim was still valid and that the lis pendens should remain in place.

The parties are reminded that there is a case management conference scheduled concurrently with the hearing on the motion, and the Court asks counsel to make arrangements to appear remotely at the conference and hearing.
