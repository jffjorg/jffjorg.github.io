And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the motions to enforce the settlement and has made the following decisions. The motion to enforce the settlement between Pabst Kinney and Jeron Green, Sr. is granted. The motion to enforce the settlement between Pabst Kinney and Jeron Green, Jr. is also granted, as the minor plaintiff was represented by a guardian ad litem (GAL) who was present at the settlement conference. However, the motion to enforce the settlement between Ad Astra and Tinne Smith is denied, as Smith was not personally present at the settlement conference and the court cannot enforce an oral agreement made through an attorney. The court previously denied the motion to rescind the settlement, and the parties are ordered to finalize the settlement by placing the minor plaintiff's funds in a blocked account. If the parties fail to do so, the funds will remain inaccessible. The court has scheduled a hearing for October 3, 2023, for further discussion and potential submission on the tentative ruling.

## English Summary

This tentative ruling addresses two motions to enforce a settlement agreement reached in a civil case. The motions were filed by defendants Ad Astra and Pabst Kinney against plaintiffs Jeron Green, Sr., Jeron Green, Jr., and Tinne Smith.

The court previously approved the settlement, which included payments of $40,000 to Jeron Green, Sr., $30,000 to Jeron Green, Jr., and $20,000 to Tinne Smith. However, the agreement was reached without Tinne Smith's personal presence in court.

The court grants Pabst Kinney's motion to enforce the settlement with both Jeron Green, Sr. and Jeron Green, Jr.  It finds that Jeron Green, Jr.'s agreement to the settlement was valid because he was represented by his guardian ad litem, who was present in court. 

Regarding Tinne Smith, the court denies both defendants' motions to enforce the settlement. It emphasizes that under California law, a client must personally agree to a settlement in open court for it to be enforceable. Since Tinne Smith was absent, the court lacks the authority to enforce the agreement against her.  



The court also reminds the plaintiffs that they must place the settlement funds for Jeron Green, Jr. into a blocked account to finalize the agreement. Failure to do so will indefinitely prevent access to those funds.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to enforce the settlement agreement between the parties. The parties had agreed to a settlement on January 5, 2023, and the court had approved the settlement on March 23, 2023. On July 14, 2023, the court denied the plaintiffs' motion to rescind the settlement.

The court has granted Pabst Kinney's motion to enforce the settlement between itself and Jeron Green, Sr., as well as the minor plaintiff, Jeron Green, Jr. The court has also granted Pabst Kinney's motion to enforce the settlement between itself and the minor plaintiff, Jeron Green, Jr.

However, the court has denied the motions to enforce the settlement between Tinne Smith and the defendants, Ad Astra and Pabst Kinney, as Smith was not present at the settlement and did not personally agree to the settlement. The court notes that CCP §664.6 requires that the parties personally agree to the settlement in open court before it can be enforced, and that the statute does not permit an attorney to bind a client by signing a written agreement.

The court has ordered the parties to give notice of the ruling and has informed them that they must have the minor plaintiff's funds placed in a blocked account in order to finalize the settlement. If the parties fail to do so, the funds will remain inaccessible to any of the plaintiffs indefinitely.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to enforce the settlement in the case of Jeron Green, Sr., Jeron Green, Jr., and Tinne Smith vs. Ad Astra and Pabst Kinney. The parties had previously agreed to a settlement, with the elder Green receiving $40,000, the junior Green receiving $30,000, and Smith receiving $20,000. However, the plaintiffs later filed a motion to rescind the settlement, which was denied by the court.

The defendants have now filed motions to enforce the settlement, which the court has partially granted and partially denied. The court has granted the motion to enforce the settlement between Pabst Kinney and the elder Green, as well as between Pabst Kinney and the minor plaintiff, Jeron Green, Jr. However, the court has denied the motions to enforce the settlement against Tinne Smith, as she was not present in court when the settlement was agreed to and there is no authority permitting the court to enforce a settlement against a party who orally agreed to it through their attorney.

The court has ordered the defendants to give notice and has informed the plaintiffs that they must place the minor plaintiff's funds in a blocked account in order to finalize the settlement. The parties have been instructed to submit on the tentative ruling or appear remotely at the hearing.
