And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the motions to enforce the settlement and has made the following decisions. The motion to enforce the settlement between Pabst Kinney and Jeron Green, Sr. is granted. The motion to enforce the settlement between Pabst Kinney and Jeron Green, Jr. is also granted, as the minor plaintiff was represented by a guardian ad litem (GAL) who was present at the settlement conference. However, the motion to enforce the settlement between Ad Astra and Tinne Smith is denied, as Smith was not personally present at the settlement conference and the court cannot enforce an oral agreement made through an attorney. The court previously denied the motion to rescind the settlement, and the parties are ordered to finalize the settlement by placing the minor plaintiff's funds in a blocked account. If the parties fail to do so, the funds will remain inaccessible. The court has scheduled a hearing for October 3, 2023, for further discussion and potential submission on the tentative ruling.
