And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by Assistance at Home Care to award attorneys' fees as the prevailing party in this action. Assistance seeks to recover fees in the amount of $41,535. Global Regency Senior Care Services, LLC opposes the motion, arguing that the settlement agreement between the parties precludes an award of attorneys' fees and that the fees sought are excessive.

The judge finds that the opposition was filed one day late due to the newly-enacted court holiday on 9/22/23, but decides to consider the opposition nonetheless.

The judge rejects Global's argument that the parties' communications between 1/10/23 and 1/17/23 constitute a "new contract" that precludes an award of attorneys' fees. The judge finds that Global waived its right to argue this point by not raising it in opposition to the motion to enforce the settlement agreement.

The judge also rejects Global's argument that the fees charged are excessive. The judge finds that the billing records submitted by Assistance are detailed and do not reveal any inefficiencies or other improper conduct. The judge awards the full amount of fees sought by Assistance.

The judge orders Assistance to give notice and sets a hearing date of October 3, 2023. The parties are instructed to submit on the tentative ruling by contacting the clerk or appearing remotely at the hearing.
