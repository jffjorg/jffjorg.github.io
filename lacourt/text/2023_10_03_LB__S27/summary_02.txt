Summary of Tentative Ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for attorneys' fees brought by Assistance at Home Care, the prevailing party in this action. The motion is opposed by Globa Regency Senior Care Services, LLC, who argues that the parties entered into a subsequent contract that precludes an award of attorneys' fees and that the amount of fees sought is excessive. The Judge has considered the opposition and finds that the parties' subsequent contract is invalid and that Assistance is entitled to an award of its attorneys' fees. The Judge has also rejected Global's argument that the fees charged are excessive, finding that the billing records are detailed and do not reveal any inefficiencies or other improper conduct. As a result, the Judge awards the full amount of fees sought, totaling $41,535.
