And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to deem RFAs admitted and a motion for terminating sanctions. The defendants have filed a motion to deem RFAs admitted because the plaintiff did not serve responses to discovery, and they are seeking sanctions against the plaintiff and her attorney. The judge grants the motion to deem RFAs admitted and imposes sanctions against the plaintiff and her attorney in the amount of $450. The judge also awards the defendants $60 in filing fees.

The defendants have also filed a motion for terminating sanctions because the plaintiff has engaged in repeated abuses of the discovery process. The judge finds that the plaintiff's conduct is egregious but is inclined to deny the request for terminating sanctions. The judge notes that terminating sanctions are only warranted in the most extreme cases and are typically not awarded when outstanding discovery obligations have been complied with, although on an untimely basis.

The judge also notes that the defendants' notice of motion fails to comply with CCP §2023.040, which requires the notice of motion to identify each party, person, and/or attorney against whom sanctions are sought. Therefore, the judge is without power to award monetary sanctions. The judge orders the defendants to give notice and directs the parties to submit on the tentative or appear remotely at the hearing.
