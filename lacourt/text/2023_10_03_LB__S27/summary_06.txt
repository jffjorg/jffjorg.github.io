And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a petition for relief from failure to file a timely claim against the County of Long Beach. The petitioner, Leonides Enriquez, was shot by police officers employed by the County and seeks relief from the failure to file a timely claim. The City of Long Beach, which was initially listed as the respondent, is actually not a party in this action. The Court notes that the petitioner failed to include copies of the government tort claim and application for leave to file a late claim with the petition.

The Court finds that the petition is untimely filed, as it was filed more than six months after the application for leave to file a late claim was rejected. The Court also notes that the Emergency Rule 9, which tolled the statutes of limitations and repose, had a sunset date of June 30, 2022, and was not applicable to this case.

The Court denies the petition and orders the parties to give notice. The Court also takes the Case Management Conference and future motion scheduled for February 22, 2024 off calendar.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Leonides Enriquez v. County of Long Beach. The case concerns Enriquez's petition for relief from failure to file a timely claim against the County. Enriquez suffered gunshot wounds from police officers employed by the County and served a government tort claim and application for leave to file a late claim. The City of Long Beach denied the application and Enriquez subsequently filed the petition.

The judge notes that the petition must be filed within six months after the application for leave to file a late claim is rejected, and that the time limit is mandatory and acts as a statute of limitations. The judge also finds that the petition was not filed within this time period, despite Enriquez's argument that Emergency Rule 9 extended the statute of limitations.

The judge has denied the petition because it was not filed within the required time period. The judge has also ordered that the case management conference and future motion hearing scheduled for February 22, 2024, be taken off calendar.

case\_number: 23LBCP00168
hearing\_date: October 3, 2023
dept: S27

background\_facts:
- date: 8/08/21
event: Petitioner suffers injuries that give rise to this action
- date: 7/25/22
event: Petitioner serves his government tort claim and application for leave to file a late claim on the City of Long Beach
- date: 9/14/22
event: The City denies the application for leave to file a late claim
- date: 4/28/23
event: Petitioner files the instant petition

petition:
law\_governing\_petitions:
- text: Pursuant to Gov Code §946.6(c), the Court is required to grant a petition for relief from failure to file timely claim if it finds, based on facts alleged in the petition, attached declarations and evidence taken at the hearing, both that (a) the claimant's late claim application to the entity (under Gov Code §911.4) was made within a “reasonable time” not exceeding one year after accrual of the cause of action, and (b) failure to present a timely claim in the first instance was due to any of the statutory grounds for which the entity should have granted claimant's late claim application.
- text: The petition must be filed within six months after the application for leave to file a late claim is rejected.
- case\_citation: J.M. Huntington Beach Union High School Dist. (2017) 2 Cal.5th 648, 653-656

initial\_notes:
- text: Petitioner failed, with his petition, to include copies of the government tort claim and application for leave to file a late claim.

request\_for\_judicial\_notice:
- text: Respondent seeks judicial notice of various minute orders and findings in NA117793, a criminal case in which Petitioner was the defendant.

time\_between\_denial\_and\_filing\_of\_petition:
- text: Defendant argues the petition should be summarily denied because it was filed more than six months after the application was rejected.
- petitioner\_argument: The six-month period was extended by Emergency Rule 9, which did not sunset until 6/30/22.
- text: The Court finds the key issue is this: Petitioner’s application for leave to file a late claim was rejected in September of 2022. At best, this commenced a six-month “statute of limitations” to file the instant petition. September of 2022, however, was after the time periods in subdivisions (a) and (b), and was also after the sunset of the rule. Petitioner failed entirely to show how or why the six-month statute of limitations to file this petition would have been extended by the rule. The petition is therefore denied because it was not filed within six months after the application was rejected.

case\_management\_conference:
- text: A petition is a summary proceeding. The petition is denied, and there is nothing further to be done in this action.
- text: Because the petition is a summary proceeding, the Court takes the CMC and future motion scheduled for 2/22/24 off calendar.
- order: Petitioner is ordered to give notice.
