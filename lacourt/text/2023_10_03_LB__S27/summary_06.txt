And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a petition for relief from failure to file a timely claim against the County of Long Beach. The petitioner, Leonides Enriquez, was shot by police officers employed by the County and seeks relief from the failure to file a timely claim. The City of Long Beach, which was initially listed as the respondent, is actually not a party in this action. The Court notes that the petitioner failed to include copies of the government tort claim and application for leave to file a late claim with the petition.

The Court finds that the petition is untimely filed, as it was filed more than six months after the application for leave to file a late claim was rejected. The Court also notes that the Emergency Rule 9, which tolled the statutes of limitations and repose, had a sunset date of June 30, 2022, and was not applicable to this case.

The Court denies the petition and orders the parties to give notice. The Court also takes the Case Management Conference and future motion scheduled for February 22, 2024 off calendar.
