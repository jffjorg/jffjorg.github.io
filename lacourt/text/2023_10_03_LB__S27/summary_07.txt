The Defendants filed an answer with various affirmative defenses, including breach of governing documents, nuisance, negligence, and declaratory relief.

The judge has also ruled that the Defendants' twelfth affirmative defense, alleging the complaint is barred by the statute of limitations, is overruled.

The judge has ruled that the Defendants' first, sixth, eleventh, and fifteenth affirmative defenses, alleging shared negligence, are well-pled and have overruled the demurrer to these defenses. The judge has also ruled that the Defendants' third, fourth, seventh, eighth, and ninth affirmative defenses, alleging assumption of risk, failure to mitigate, estoppel, unclean hands, and laches, are insufficiently pled and have sustained the demurrer to these defenses with leave to amend.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the answer filed by the defendant, Fred Di Bernardo and Katheryne Vance. The plaintiffs, Michele and Barrett Travis, had filed a complaint alleging that the defendant's condo unit above theirs had leaked, causing damage. The defendant had filed an answer with various affirmative defenses, including breach of governing documents, nuisance, negligence, and declaratory relief.

The judge found that the demurrer to the second, fifth, tenth, fourteenth, and sixteenth affirmative defenses was sustained without leave to amend, as they failed to state a defense. The demurrer to the first, sixth, eleventh, and fifteenth affirmative defenses was overruled, as they were well-pled and stated facts to support the assertions.

The judge also ordered the defendant to file an amended answer within 20 days, omitting any affirmative defenses for which she did not have factual support. The defendant may file a motion for leave to amend her answer if she discovers additional facts during the course of litigation.

The judge encouraged the parties to meet and confer and stipulate to the filing of an amended answer, and reminded the defendant of her obligation to meet and confer in connection with pleading challenges. The court's tentative ruling is subject to change based on any opposition or further briefing.
