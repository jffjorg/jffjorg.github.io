And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to answer filed by the Plaintiffs, Michele and Barrett Travis, against the Defendants, Fred Di Bernardo and Katheryne Vance. The Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants' condo unit above their unit leaked and caused damages. The Defendants filed an answer with various affirmative defenses, including breach of governing documents, nuisance, negligence, and declaratory relief.

The judge has ruled that the Defendants' second, fifth, tenth, fourteenth, and sixteenth affirmative defenses are insufficiently pled and have sustained the demurrer to these defenses without leave to amend. The judge has also ruled that the Defendants' twelfth affirmative defense, alleging the complaint is barred by the statute of limitations, is overruled.

The judge has ruled that the Defendants' first, sixth, eleventh, and fifteenth affirmative defenses, alleging shared negligence, are well-pled and have overruled the demurrer to these defenses. The judge has also ruled that the Defendants' third, fourth, seventh, eighth, and ninth affirmative defenses, alleging assumption of risk, failure to mitigate, estoppel, unclean hands, and laches, are insufficiently pled and have sustained the demurrer to these defenses with leave to amend.

The judge has ordered the Defendants to file an amended answer within 20 days, omitting any affirmative defense for which they do not have factual support. The judge has also encouraged the parties to meet and confer and stipulate to the filing of an amended answer if necessary.
