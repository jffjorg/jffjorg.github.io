2.     Petition
for Relief from Failure to File Timely Claim
a.    
Law
Governing Petitions for Relief
Pursuant to Gov Code §946.6(c), the
Court is required to grant a petition for relief from failure to file timely
claim if it finds, based on facts alleged in the petition, attached
declarations and evidence taken at the hearing, both that (a) the claimant's
late claim application to the entity (under Gov Code §911.4) was made within a
“reasonable time” not exceeding one year after accrual of the cause of action,
and (b) failure to present a timely claim in the first instance was due to any
of the statutory grounds for which the entity should have granted claimant's
late claim application.  The petition
must be filed within six months after the application for leave to file a late
claim is rejected.  §946.6(c).  The time limit is mandatory and acts as a
statute of limitations.  See J.M. Huntington
Beach Union High School Dist. (2017) 2 Cal.5th 648, 653-656.
 
As a “remedial statute,” §946.6 is
to be liberally construed so as to permit claimants with a recognized excuse to
have their cases heard on the merits; i.e., doubts are to be resolved in favor
of granting the §946.6 petition.  Draper
v. City of Los Angeles (1990) 52 Cal.3d 502, 507; Renteria v. Juvenile Justice,
Dept. of Corrections & Rehab. (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 903, 910.
 
An order granting §946.6 relief
completely excuses the plaintiff from filing any claim at all, allowing suit to
be filed within 30 days.  Viles v. State
of Calif. (1967) 66 Cal.2d 24, 27; Ard v. County of Contra Costa (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th
339, 343.
 
b.     Initial Notes
Petitioner served his government
tort claim and his application for leave to file a late government tort claim on
the City of Long Beach.  Petitioner named
the County of Long Beach, “et al.” as the respondent in this action.  The opposition to the petition indicates it
is brought by “Defendant, City of Long Beach.” 
There is no defendant in this action; this is a petition, and therefore
there is only a respondent.  In any
event, there appears to be substantial confusion concerning whether the city or
the county is the respondent in this action. 

 
The Court also notes that
Petitioner failed, with his petition, to include copies of the government tort
claim and application for leave to file a late claim.  Respondent included these documents with the opposition.  
 
c.     Request
for Judicial Notice
Respondent seeks judicial notice of
various minute orders and findings in NA117793, a criminal case in which
Petitioner was the defendant.  The RJN
does not form the basis of this ruling, but is granted regardless.  
 
d.     Time
Between Denial of Application and Filing of Petition
As noted above, the City denied the
application for leave to file a late claim on 9/14/22.  Petitioner filed this petition on
4/28/23.  4/28/23 is substantially more
than six months after 9/14/22, and therefore Defendant argues the petition should
be summarily denied.  Gov Code §946.6(c),
J.M., supra, at 653-656.  
 
Plaintiff contends the six-month
period was extended by Emergency Rule 9, which did not sunset until
6/30/22.  Rule 9(c) provides, “This rule
will sunset on June 30, 2022, unless otherwise amended or repealed…This sunset
does not nullify the effect of the tolling of the statutes of limitation and
repose under the rule.”  Rule 9(a) and
(b), however, provide:
(a) Tolling statutes of limitations
over 180 days
Notwithstanding any other law, the
statutes of limitations and repose for civil causes of action that exceed 180
days are tolled from April 6, 2020, until October 1, 2020.
(b) Tolling statutes of limitations
of 180 days or less
Notwithstanding any other law, the
statutes of limitations and repose for civil causes of action that are 180 days
or less are tolled from April 6, 2020, until August 3, 2020.
 
The parties do not adequately focus
the issues with respect to the tolling provision.  Defendant, by way of example, contends the
rule had a sunset date of 6/30/21, but it was actually 6/30/22.  Defendant also argues the rule does not apply
to government tort claims or petitions, but does not cite any applicable authority.  Plaintiff assumes, without briefing, that the
provisions cover his injuries, which were sustained in August of 2021, after the
time period in subdivisions (a) and (b).
 
The Court finds the key issue is
this: Petitioner’s application for leave to file a late claim was rejected in
September of 2022.  At best, this
commenced a six-month “statute of limitations” to file the instant petition.  September of 2022, however, was after the time
periods in subdivisions (a) and (b), and was also after the sunset of the
rule.  Petitioner failed entirely to show
how or why the six-month statute of limitations to file this petition would
have been extended by the rule.  The petition
is therefore denied because it was not filed within six months after the
application was rejected.
 
3.     Case
Management Conference and Future Motion Hearing
A petition is a summary
proceeding.  The petition is denied, and
there is nothing further to be done in this action.  
 
Because the petition is a summary
proceeding, the Court takes the CMC and future motion scheduled for 2/22/24 off
calendar.  
 
Petitioner is ordered to give
notice.  
 
Parties who intend to submit
on this tentative must contact the clerk at 562-256-2227 indicating intention to submit on the tentative as directed by
the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department
does not receive an email indicating the parties are submitting on the tentative
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion may be placed off calendar.  If a party submits on the tentative, the
party’s email must include the case number and must identify the party
submitting on the tentative. If any party does not submit on the tentative, the
party should make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing on this matter.
