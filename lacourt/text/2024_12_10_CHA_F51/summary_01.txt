And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the unopposed motion for summary judgment filed by Defendant Marc Harvey Incerpi, M.D. The motion seeks an order granting summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication in favor of the defendant and against the plaintiff, Ceasar Carrillo.

The plaintiff alleges medical malpractice against multiple defendants, including the defendant, claiming that the defendant's negligence caused the plaintiff's premature birth and resulting complications. However, the defendant argues that he acted within the standard of care in treating the plaintiff's mother.

The court finds that the defendant has met his initial burden to present facts that negate a necessary element of a medical malpractice cause of action. Since the plaintiff has chosen not to oppose the motion, he has failed to offer any responsive evidence to show a triable issue of material fact exists as to this cause of action.

Accordingly, the court grants the motion and orders the plaintiff to file a proposed judgment within 10 days.
