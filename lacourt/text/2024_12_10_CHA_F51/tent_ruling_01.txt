Carrillo in her capacity as his  guardian ad litem (“Plaintiff”) NOTICE: OK    RELIEF REQUESTED: An  order granting summary judgment, or, in the alternative, summary adjudication,  in favor of Moving Defendant and against Plaintiff.   TENTATIVE RULING: The unopposed motion is granted.   BACKGROUND    This is a medical  malpractice action in which Plaintiff alleges that in 2016, at Moving  Defendant’s hospital, various medical providers, including Moving Defendant,  negligently treated his mother, Maria Carillo (“Ms. Carillo”), who was 34 weeks  pregnant with Plaintiff, resulting in Ms. Carillo’s appendix bursting and  Plaintiff being born several weeks premature, “with numerous and significant  complications, including but not limited to respiratory distress, neonatal  sepsis, right sided intraventricular brain hemorrhage and grade IV left sided  intraventricular brain hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, and subarachnoid  hemorrhage resulting in hydrocephalus that has required the implantation of a  ventriculoperitoneal shunt in Ceasar Carrillo’s brain.” (Compl. ¶¶ 12–15.)   On  11/10/22, Plaintiff filed his complaint, alleging against five named defendants  the sole cause of action for Medical Malpractice. On 3/13/23, Moving Defendant  filed his answer.   On 9/19/24,  Moving Defendant filed the instant motion for summary judgment. No opposition  has been filed to date. // // // // ANALYSIS   The function of a motion for summary judgment or  adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing party cannot  show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an order of  summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield  Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil Procedure section 437c,  subdivision (c) “requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the  evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’  and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no  triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to  judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7  Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of the pleadings in a motion for summary  judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the affidavits  or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of fact  within the issues delimited by the pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento  (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 65, citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima  (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 381–382.)    As to each claim as framed by the complaint, the defendant  moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial burden of proof by  presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to establish a defense.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005)  128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519–1520.)     Once the defendant has met that burden, the burden shifts  to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts  exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto. To establish a triable  issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial  responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 163.) Courts “liberally  construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and  resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v.  Arnold Worldwide, Inc.¿(2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)    A.     Medical Malpractice  – Professional Negligence   Plaintiff’s sole cause of action alleges Medical Malpractice  – Professional Negligence against all Defendants. “The elements of a cause of  action for medical malpractice are: (1) a duty to use such skill, prudence, and  diligence as other members of the profession commonly possess and exercise; (2)  a breach of the duty; (3) a proximate causal connection between the negligent  conduct and the injury; and (4) resulting loss or damage.” (Chakalis v.  Elevator Solutions, Inc. (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 1557, 1571.)   Here,  Moving Defendant argues that he, “acted within the applicable standard of care  in connection with Plaintiff’s care and treatment.” (MSJ 14:26–27.) In support  of this contention, Moving Defendant proffers the sworn declaration of his  expert, a licensed medical doctor specializing in Perinatology, Obstetrics  & Gynecology, and Obstetrics & Gynecology – Maternal Fetal Medicine,  stating that “to a reasonable degree of medical probability Dr. Incerpi’s care  and treatment of the patient was appropriate and within the standard of care.”  (Decl. of Bruce Kovacs, M.D., ¶¶ 1, 4.) Dr. Kovacs further asserts that “to a  reasonable degree of medical probability, no act or omission by Dr. Incerpi was  below the standard of care or was a substantial factor that caused or  contributed to any injury suffered by Plaintiff Caesar Carrillo in his care and  treatment of Maria Carrillo.” (Id. at ¶ 5.)   Based  on the foregoing, the Court finds that Moving Defendant has met his initial  burden to present facts to negate a necessary element of a Medical Malpractice  cause of action. As Plaintiff has chosen not to oppose the instant motion, he has therefore failed to offer any  responsive evidence to show a triable issue of material fact exists as to this  cause of action. Accordingly, the Court finds that Moving Defendant is entitled  to summary judgment.   CONCLUSION    The unopposed motion is granted.  Plaintiff to file proposed judgment within 10  days.
