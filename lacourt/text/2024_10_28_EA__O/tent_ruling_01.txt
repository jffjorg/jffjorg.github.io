  Case Number:  23PSCV00548    Hearing Date:   October 28, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
MOTION TO QUASH SERVICE OF THE SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT AND
TO SET ASIDE DEFAULT JUDGMENT PURSUANT TO CALIFORNIA CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE §
473.5 is DENIED; service was in substantial compliance with the code
because Zhou and/or Zeng received actual notice of the summons and litigation
documents via mail, email, and a call.  
 
Background
 
This is a collections case.
 
On February 24, 2023, Plaintiff CREDITORS ADJUSTMENT BUREAU,
INC—a collection agency assigned this account by State Compensation Insurance
Fund ("SCIF") for premiums due in connections with two workers
compensation insurance policies—filed led suit against Defendant Universal
Elite Construction, LLC for $182,531.59.
 
On April 24, 2023, default was entered against Defendant.
 
On July 13, 2023, the court entered default judgment as to
Plaintiff’s 5/30/23 request for entry of default judgment.
 
On July 31, 2024, Defendant filed a ‘Substitution of
Attorney’ naming Counsel Rios as its attorney.
 
On August 30, 2024, Defendant filed the instant motion.
 
On October 15, 2024, Plaintiff filed its opposition.
 
To date, as of Friday, 10/25, no Reply has been received
(due 5 court days before hearing, Monday, 10/21).
 
Legal Standard[1]
Defendant
relies upon 473.5 to set aside the default judgment. (See e.g., Motion pp. 6-7;
see also Opp. p. ii.) 
 
In turn, Section 473.5 subdivision (a)
provides the following:
 
When service of a summons has not
resulted in actual notice to a party in time to defend the action and a
default or default judgment has been entered against him or her in the action,
he or she may serve and file a notice of motion to set aside the default or
default judgment and for leave to defend the action. The notice of motion
shall be served and filed within a reasonable time, but in no
event exceeding the earlier of: (i) two years after entry of a default
judgment against him or her; or (ii) 180 days after service on him or her
of a written notice that the default or default judgment has been entered.
(emphasis and underline added).
 
This statue affords
discretionary relief. (Ramos v. Homeward
Residential, Inc. (2014) 223
Cal.App.4th 1434, 1444.) As summarized by the court in Goya v.
P.E.R.U Enterprises (1978) 87 Cal.App.3d 886:
 
[The statute] permits
the court to set aside a default or default judgment against a defendant
and allow him to defend the action on its merits if (1) he received through no
inexcusable fault of his own, no actual notice of the action in time to appear
and defend, and had not made a general appearance; (2) a default or default
judgment has been entered against him by the court; (3) he acted with
reasonable diligence in serving and filing the notice of motion to set aside
the default or default judgment; and (4) he has a meritorious defense.
(Comment (to section 473.5) Judicial
Council.) (Id. at pp. 890-891, emphasis added.) 
 
 
 
 
 
Discussion[2]
 
Before engaging in
the merits and relevant authority, the court provides the following undisputed
facts:
 
-     
The
proof of service indicates that on 3/8/23, a registered process server served Defendant
via substituted service by leaving the documents with Hui Wang
“Co-Occupant.” 
-     
Plaintiff
acknowledges that it did not make any effort at personal service before the
(alleged) substituted service. (Opp. p. 3:16-22)
-     
Hui
Wang is Kevin Zhou’s mother who is not an employee, officer, or agent authorized to
accept service of process for the LLC. Hui Wang does not live at the residence
nor speaks English. (Kevin Zhou according to the Statement of Information is
the CEO of the LLC.) 
-     
The
address where the party was served as 34 Willowbrook Lane in the city of Pomona.[3] This
address is also the only address identified for Defendant as its
"Principal Address" and "Mailing Address," and is also the
only address identified as where Kevin C. Zhou could be served as the agent for
service of process. 
-     
The process server mailed copies of the
lawsuit related legal documents to defendant's address. This mailing was not
returned by the Post Office.
-     
On
June 20, 2023, plaintiff filed its request for entry of default judgment, of
which another copy was mailed to defendant's address; this mail was also not
returned by the post office.
-     
On July 17, 2023, a representative from plaintiff’s office called the registered
telephone number of Yanfen Zeng, a manager/member of defendant.[4]
Although Ms. Zeng claimed to not speak English, Ms. Zeng was able to find a
translator and plaintiffs representative discuss with her at length regarding
the judgment which was entered against defendant, the possible consequences,
and that the CSLB license may be suspended if the judgment was not address. (See
Johnson Decl., pp. 48-55 of 56 of PDF [includes notes from the conversation and
an 7/17/23 email sent to Zeng].)[5] 
-     
On
June 19, 2024, Plaintiff sent a letter to the CSLB advising CSLB of the
judgment and requesting that Defendant’s license be suspended. 
-     
On
June 20, 2024, the CSLB suspended Defendant’s license. 
 
The Code of Civil Procedure provides a number of
ways to serve process on a corporation doing business in the state such as (i)
service by service on the corporation's designated agent for service of
process. (Code Civ. Proc.,1 § 416.10, subd. (a));
(ii) personally delivering a summons and complaint to those corporate officers,
managers and employees identified in section 416.10, subdivision (b);
or (iii) by delivering process to someone in charge of the office of one of the
individuals identified in section 416.10, subdivision (b) and
then mailing the individual a copy of the summons and complaint. (§ 415.20.)
 The individuals pertinent to the latter option include “the president, chief executive officer, or
other head of the corporation, a vice president, a secretary or assistant
secretary, a treasurer or assistant treasurer, a
controller or chief financial officer, a general
manager, or a person authorized by the corporation to receive service of
process.” (§416.10, subd. (b).) “Because the face of [Plaintiff’s] proof of
service fails to identify any individual specified in section 416.10, subdivision (b) who
was served on behalf of the corporation, the proof of service and, hence, the
judgment-roll, show that the judgment is void for lack of proper service.” (Ramos,
supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 1442.) But the inquiry does not end there.
The court turns to the Ramos court’s explanation of service that is in
substantial compliance with the code section(s). 
 
It is axiomatic that
strict compliance with the code's provisions for service of process is not
required. (Pasadena Medi–Center Associates v.
Superior Court (1973) 9
Cal.3d 773, 778, 108 Cal.Rptr. 828, 511 P.2d 1180; Dill v. Berquist Construction Co., supra, 24 Cal.App.4th at p. 1436, 29 Cal.Rptr.2d
746; Espindola v. Nunez (1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 1389, 1391, 245 Cal.Rptr. 596.)
“Although some decisions under pre-1969 statutes required strict and exact
compliance with the statutory requirements [citation], the provisions of
the new law, according to its draftsmen, ‘are to be liberally construed. ... As
stated in the Nov. 25, 1968, Report of the Judicial Council's Special Committee
on Jurisdiction, pp. 14–15: “The provisions of this chapter should be liberally
construed to effectuate service and uphold the jurisdiction of the court if actual notice has been received by the defendant, and
in the last analysis the question of service should be resolved by considering
each situation from a practical standpoint. ...” The liberal construction rule,
it is anticipated, will eliminate unnecessary, time-consuming, and costly
disputes over legal technicalities, without prejudicing the right of defendants
to proper notice of court proceedings.’ [Citation.]” (Pasadena Medi–Center Associates v. Superior Court, supra, at p. 778, 108 Cal.Rptr. 828, 511 P.2d 1180,
italics added.) “Thus, substantial compliance is sufficient.” (Dill v. Berquist Construction Co., supra, at p. 1437, 29 Cal.Rptr.2d 746.)
In general, substantial compliance with the code occurs when, although not
properly identified in a proof of service, the person to
be served in fact actually received the summons
 “[W]hen the defendant is a corporation, the ‘person to be served’ is one
of the individuals specified in section 416.10. Therefore, [plaintiff] could be
held to have substantially complied with the statute if, despite his failure to
address the mail to one of the persons to be served on behalf of the
defendants, the summons was actually received by one of the persons to be
served.” (Dill v. Berquist Construction Co., supra, at p. 1437, 29 Cal.Rptr.2d 746.)
 
Here, Plaintiff used none of the methods
prescribed in the Code of Civil Procedure for service of process on Defendant.
Rather, plaintiff left a summons and complaint with a “co-occupant” and then
mailed the corporation, rather serving any individual officer or manager with a
copy of the summons and complaint. Notwithstanding, Defendant has not
offered evidence from which it might be inferred a person specified in section 416.10 did
not actually receive documents. To the contrary, none
of the mail sent to the corporation’s principal and mailing address was
returned.  
 
Therefore, the court determines that
the record shows that Defendant received actual notice of the lawsuit via
mail to show substantial compliance with the service requirements on a
corporation. 
 
Service aside, Defendant
has not met the requirements of this statute. First, Defendant does
not explain how it was reasonable to wait over one year from the last
communication on 7/13/23 to seek relief. Second, Defendant has
not advanced a meritorious defense to the breach of contract/account stated
action.
 
All in all, “relief under
section 473.5 is available only where the defendant's lack of actual notice
‘was not caused by his or her avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect.’ (§
473.5, subd. (b).).” (Ramos, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 1444.) Here, Defendant
ignored the written notice of the action such that any lack of actual
notice was caused by Defendant’s own inexcusable neglect. 
 
Conclusion 
 
Based on the foregoing—in that Defendant did
have actual notice of the summons and complaint and that its ignorance was
the result of inexcusable neglect—the motion is DENIED.
