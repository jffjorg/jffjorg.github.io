```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment and allow the defendant to defend the action on its merits. The defendant argued that it did not receive actual notice of the lawsuit and that the service of process was defective. However, the judge found that the defendant received actual notice of the lawsuit via mail, email, and a call, and that the service of process was sufficient under California law. The judge also found that the defendant's lack of notice was caused by its own inexcusable neglect, as it ignored the written notice of the action. Therefore, the judge denied the motion and upheld the default judgment.
