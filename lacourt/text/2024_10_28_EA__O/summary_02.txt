And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant has filed a motion to set aside a default judgment entered against them. The defendant claims that they are entitled to relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b), which provides relief for mistakes, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. However, the court finds that the motion is untimely, as it was filed more than six months after the entry of default judgment. The court also notes that the plaintiff's reliance on case law is not persuasive, as the cases cited are not directly applicable to the facts of this case. Finally, the court is aware that the conversation between the plaintiff and defendant occurred after the entry of default judgment, which may have impacted the defendant's ability to investigate and respond to the lawsuit in a timely manner.
