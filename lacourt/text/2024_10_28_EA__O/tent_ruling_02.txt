Defendant’s motion states that Defendant seeks to set aside the default
judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure (CCP)[1]
section 473(b), which provides relief due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise,
or excusable neglect. (Motion p. 2:16-22 [‘Introduction’ section].) Such a motion
“shall be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months,
after the judgment….” (Code of Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b), emphasis added.)
Here, however, this statute would be inapplicable because any motion must have
been filed by 1/13/24 (six months from entry of default judgment on 7/13/23),
but instead was made on 8/30/24. 
 


[2] Plaintiff’s reliance upon Pulte Homes Corp. v.
Williams Mechanical, Inc. (2016) 2 Cal.App.5th 267 and Hoski v. U-Haul
Co. (1963) 212 Cal.App.2d 640 as cases “directly on point” are not
instructive. (Opp. p. 5.) For one, the former case involved service upon the
dissolved corporation’s attorney whereas here, the officer’s mother was
served, and the latter case predates the 1969 amendment to the statute. 
 


[3] The court notes that this address appears to also be
Zhou’s personal residence as his declaration states his mother does not
“live” there and that she occasionally visits to “water the plants.” 
 


[4] The court is cognizant that this conversation
happened after entry of default judgment.
 


[5] The opposition states that Plaintiff called Defendant
“many times” suggesting that the parties spoke multiple times, but a review of
Johnson’s declaration indicates that they only had one conversation over the
phone. (Opp. p. 7:1-2.)
