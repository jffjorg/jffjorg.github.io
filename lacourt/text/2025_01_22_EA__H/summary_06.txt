And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Intecann Security, Inc.'s motion to stay proceedings in a lawsuit filed by Alexander Peralta. Peralta claims that Intecann failed to secure workers' compensation insurance and did not maintain a safe working environment, resulting in a work injury. Intecann argued that Peralta cannot pursue a civil action against them because workers' compensation is the sole and exclusive remedy. However, the Judge found that Peralta is entitled to pursue both the workers' compensation claim and the civil action because Intecann failed to obtain insurance coverage. The Judge also noted that Peralta's counsel represents that there is no activity occurring in the workers' compensation case and that the last activity was Peralta's deposition in July 2025 (although this date appears to be an error).
