And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a Judge regarding a motion to set aside default in a lawsuit. The lawsuit was filed by Malissa Murillo, who alleges that she was subjected to sexual harassment and wage theft while working at Dr. Privitera's Holistic Clinic and Alternative Endeavors, Inc. The defendants, including Dr. Privitera's Holistic Clinic, Alternative Endeavors, Inc., and Anakin Mark Privitera, have moved to set aside the default judgments entered against them.

The Court notes that the defendants' motion does not comply with California Rules of Court rule 3.1113(d) and (f) and admonishes counsel for not complying with these procedural requirements. The Court also rejects the defendants' argument that service of the summons and complaint was improper, finding it to be waived and grossly untimely.

The Court denies the defendants' motion to set aside default, except that it orders counsel to meet and confer regarding the legal status of Dr. Privitera's Holistic Clinic and file a Joint Status Report by close of business on January 22, 2025. The Court also vacates an Order to Show Cause Re: Default Judgment as to Endeavors, which was calendared in error.
