 Case Number:  23PSCV00259    Hearing Date:   January 22, 2025    Dept:  H Straight  Forwarding, Inc. v. Global Sales Channel Group Inc.,   Case No. 23PSCV00259   ORDER ON APPLICATION FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENTPlaintiff Straight Forwarding, Inc.’s Application
for Default Judgment is DENIED without prejudice.   Background Plaintiff  Straight Forwarding, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows:           Plaintiff provides logistic services,  including arranging shipment of freight and providing storage/warehouse  services for its customers. Commencing in or about October 2022, Plaintiff and Global  Sales Channel Group Inc. (“Global”) agreed that Plaintiff would handle certain  shipments for Global arriving in Los Angeles in exchange for a fee and  reimbursement of expenses and costs. Plaintiff sent Global invoices totaling  $30,765.84, but Global has failed to pay.           On or about October 1, 2022, Haidong  Ou aka Alan Ou (“Ou”) issued Check No. 1055 for $10,000.00 to Plaintiff on  Global’s account, but it bounced. On October 28, 2022, Plaintiff received Check  No. 1061 for $6,300.47 on Global’s account, which was post-dated for November  22, 2022. Defendants asked Plaintiff not to deposit Check No. 1061 until  November 22, 2022, but requested that Plaintiff release their shipment in the  interim. Plaintiff complied, but Check No. 1061 also bounced when Plaintiff  deposited it. On  July 21, 2023, Plaintiff filed an “Amendment to Complaint,” wherein Ou was  named in lieu of Doe 1. On  August 9, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), asserting  causes of action against Global and Does 1-50 for (1) Breach of Contract (against  Global only); (2) Open Book Account (against Global only); (3) Account Stated (against  Global only); and (4) Fraud Based on Bad Check. On  March 9, 2024, Global’s default was entered. On June 13, 2024, Ou’s default was  entered. Pending  before the Court is Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment.    Discussion Plaintiff’s  Application for Default Judgment is denied without prejudice. The  following defects are noted:           1.       Plaintiff  has provided the Court with only one Request for Court Judgment (Judicial  Council Form CIV-100), directed against both Global and Ou in the total amount  of $36,780.63 (comprised of $30,765.84 demand of complaint, plus $5,504.79  interest and $510.00 costs). The “Brief in Support of Default Judgment,”  however, indicates that Plaintiff is seeking $36,780.63 against Global and only  $6,300.47 against Ou. Plaintiff should resubmit two separate Request for Court  Judgment (Judicial Council Form CIV-100), one for Global and one for Ou.           2.       The  exhibits attached to the “Brief in Support of Default Judgment” lack foundation  and authentication and are not considered.           3.       Plaintiff  purports to seek $6,300.47 from Ou pursuant to Civil Code § 1719, subdivision  (a)(2), which reads as follows:            “Notwithstanding any penal sanctions that may  apply, any person who passes a check on insufficient funds shall be liable to  the payee for damages equal to treble the amount of the check if a written demand  for payment is mailed by certified mail to the person who had passed a check on  insufficient funds and the written demand informs this person of (A) the  provisions of this section, (B) the amount of the check, and (C) the amount of  the service charge payable to the payee. The person who had passed a check  on insufficient funds shall have 30 days from the date the written demand was  mailed to pay the amount of the check, the amount of the service charge payable  to the payee, and the costs to mail the written demand for payment. If this person  fails to pay in full the amount of the check, the service charge payable to the  payee, and the costs to mail the written demand within this period, this person  shall then be liable instead for the amount of the check, minus any partial  payments made toward the amount of the check or the service charge within 30  days of the written demand, and damages equal to treble that amount, which  shall not be less than one hundred dollars ($100) nor more than one thousand  five hundred dollars ($1,500). When a person becomes liable for treble damages  for a check that is the subject of a written demand, that person shall no  longer be liable for any service charge for that check and any costs to mail  the written demand.” (Emphasis added). Plaintiff  has not provided the Court with any evidence that a written demand for payment  was mailed to Ou via certified mail containing the information set forth above  and that Ou failed to make any payment within the 30 days set forth above.  There is no reference to Civil Code § 1719 in the FAC. Accordingly,  the application is denied without prejudice. Plaintiff is directed to submit a  revised default judgment packet that addresses the aforementioned defects.
