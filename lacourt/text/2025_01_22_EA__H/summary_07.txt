And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by defendant Scott Allan Cullens. The defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's third cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress is sustained, without leave to amend. The judge finds that the plaintiff's third cause of action is duplicative of their first cause of action and does not add anything new to the complaint. The defendant's motion to strike the third cause of action is denied as moot, as the court has already sustained the demurrer.
