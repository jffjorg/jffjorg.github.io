```

And here is the English text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the motion for preliminary approval of a class settlement. The proposed settlement is for the named Plaintiff on an individual basis, not a class-wide basis. Therefore, a motion for preliminary approval of a class settlement is unnecessary and improper. The court has a fiduciary duty to absent class members to review and approve class action settlements. Since there is no class settlement, the motion is denied. The court also denies the request for preliminary approval of the settlement agreement.
