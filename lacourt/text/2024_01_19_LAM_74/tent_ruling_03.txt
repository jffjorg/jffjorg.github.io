 Case Number:  23STCV03309    Hearing Date:   January 19, 2024    Dept:  74 Luis Gonzalez v. Monzon & Son
Enterprises, Inc.
 
Plaintiff Luis Gonalez’s Motion to
Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories – Employment Law (Set One)
from Defendant Monzon & Son Enterprises, Inc.
 
The
court considered the moving papers. No opposition was timely filed. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1005 [“All papers opposing a motion […] shall be filed with the court
and a copy served on each party at least nine court days […] before the
hearing.”].) 
BACKGROUND
            This action arises from an
employment dispute.
            On
Febuuray 14, 2023, Plaintiff Luis Gonzalez (Plaintiff) filed a complaint
against Defendant Monzon & Son Enterprises, Inc. (Defendant).
            On
August 7, 2023, Plaintiff served Defendant with form interrogatories, employment
law (set one) (Interrogatories). 
            On
September 22, 2023, Defendant responded with objections only.
            On
November 30, 2023, Plaintiff filed this motion to compel further responses to
the interrogatories at issue.
LEGAL STANDARD 
            ¿¿A
propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response to interrogatories
if the propounding party deems that an answer to a particular interrogatory is
evasive or incomplete, or that an objection to an interrogatory is without
merit or too general. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300,
subd. (a).) Such a motion must be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (b).) 
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff seeks further responses to
all the interrogatories at issue. As a preliminary matter, the court finds
Plaintiff has demonstrated good cause for this motion and the parties have
sufficiently met and conferred. The court also notes that Defendant’s
boilerplate objections are too general and improper. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.300, subd. (a); Korea Data Systems v. Superior Court (1997) 51
Cal.App.4th 1513, 1516.) Moreover, Defendant has not expanded upon its
objections in a timely opposition and separate statement. Thus, further
responses will be necessary. In addition, the court finds that sanctions are
warranted. Plaintiff’s counsel’s hourly rate is reasonable, and she has
sufficiently substantiated her request for attorney fees. (Manalo Decl., ¶ 10.)
But because Defendant did not file a timely opposition requiring Plaintiff’s
review and reply, the court reduces the award accordingly ($1,860 = $600/hr. x 3
hrs. + $60 filing fee). 
CONCLUSION
                The court grants Plaintiff’s motion
to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories, Employment Law (Set One). Defendant
shall provide further, Code-Compliant responses by January 29, 2024. The court
grants Plaintiff’s request for attorney sanctions. Defendant shall pay Plaintiff’s
counsel attorney fees in the sum of $1,860 by January 29, 2024.
                Plaintiff shall give notice.
