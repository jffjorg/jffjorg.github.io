 Case Number:  23STCV02267    Hearing Date:   January 19, 2024    Dept:  74 Andrew
Leavenworth v. Self-Realization Church, et al.
Defendant Alisa Miller Fein’s
Demurrer to First Amended Complaint
BACKGROUND 
            This
action arises from a dispute over personal property.
            On
June 22, 2023, Plaintiff Andrew Leavenworth (Plaintiff) filed a first amended
complaint (FAC) on behalf of Joan Wight (Decedent). Alisa Miller Fein
(Defendant Miller), Chris Bagley, Self-Realization Fellowship Church, Gurbir
Maker, Ujjal Maker, Doris Schneider, and Rosario Hurley are the named
Defendants.
            On
July 24, 2023, Defendant Miller filed this demurrer.
LEGAL STANDARD
            A
demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable. (¿¿Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318¿¿.) “¿To
survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a
cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the
plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.¿” (¿¿C.A. v. William S. Hart Union
High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872¿¿.) For the purpose of testing
the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer
admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded. (¿Aubry v. Tri-City
Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967¿.) A demurrer “¿does not
admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.¿” (¿¿Daar v.
Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713¿¿.) DISCUSSION  
Conspiracy
            Defendant Miller first argues that
the FAC does not allege any actionable conduct against her. Additionally,
Defendant Miller contends the FAC does not allege any facts to justify holding
her liable for the misconduct of others. The court disagrees. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Miller and
Defendant Self-Realization Fellowship Church (Defendant SRF) entered a
conspiracy with the other named Defendants. “In order to state a cause of
action based upon a conspiracy theory the plaintiff must allege the formation
and operation of the conspiracy, the wrongful act or acts done pursuant to it,
and the damage resulting from such acts.” (117 Sales Corp. v. Olsen (1978)
80 Cal.App.3d 645, 650.) Here, Plaintiff alleges all Defendants (including
Defendant Miller) and other SRF monastics and members entered a conspiracy to
wrongfully acquire Decedent’s property and intellectual property rights for
Defendant SRF. (FAC, ¶ 53.) Paragraph 58 of the FAC details some of Defendant Miller’s
acts done in furtherance of the conspiracy. Last, Plaintiff has alleged
resulting damage. (FAC, ¶¶ 187-188, 202-203, 217-218, 230, 234, 240, 244, 252,
260, 271, 280, 284.) Thus, Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a conspiracy in
which Defendant Miller participated.
Third Cause of
Action – Financial Elder Abuse
            Financial elder abuse occurs when a
person takes, retains, or assists in taking or retaining the personal property
of an elder for a wrongful use or with intent to defraud. (Welf. & Inst.
Code, § 15610.30, subd. (a)(1)(2).)
            Defendant Miller goes on to argue
Plaintiff’s claim for financial elder abuse fails. But Plaintiff alleges in
part that Defendant SRF’s monastics and agents stole
Decedent’s personal property from her home in January 2019, loaded the personal
property into vans owned by Defendant SRF, and transported the personal
property to Defendant SRF’s headquarters. (FAC, ¶ 143.) Moreover, Defendant SRF allegedly received the stolen property.
(FAC, ¶ 144.) A list of Decedent’s missing personal property, compiled the
following October, supports as much. (FAC, ¶ 166.)
Defendant Miller claims the FAC lacks any allegation that she ever “looted”
Decedent’s house. However, Plaintiff alleges Defendant Miller was a co-conspirator of Defendant SRF and its monastics.
(FAC, ¶ 53.) Moreover, the trier of fact could conclude that the alleged
misconduct furthered the Defendants’ conspiracy to wrongfully obtain Decedent’s
personal property. 

            Moreover, Defendant Miller argues
fraud-based claims must be supported by specific facts (who, what, where, when,
and how). (See Estate of Marler (1957) 148 Cal.App.2d 30, 37.) But a financial
elder abuse claim need not be based on fraud; it may also be based, as here, on
the taking or retention of personal property for wrongful use. Thus, the court
overrules the demurrer for this cause of action.
Fifth Cause of
Action – Conversion
            “Conversion is the wrongful exercise
of dominion over the property of another.” (Oakdale Village Group v. Fong (1996)
43 Cal.App.4th 539, 543-544.) The elements for this cause of action are as
follows: (1) the plaintiff’s ownership or right to possession of the property
at the time of the conversion, (2) the defendant’s conversion by a wrongful
act, and (3) damages. (Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Zerin (1997) 53
Cal.App.4th 445, 451.) 
            In support of her demurrer,
Defendant Miller claims no allegations in the FAC indicate she converted
Decedent’s personal property. As noted above, though, Plaintiff alleges in part
that Defendant SRF’s monastics and agents stole Decedent’s personal property
from her home in January 2019, loaded the personal property into vans owned by
Defendant SRF, and transported the personal property to Defendant SRF’s
headquarters. (FAC, ¶ 143.) Moreover, Defendant SRF allegedly received the
personal property. (FAC, ¶ 144.) Plaintiff has further provided a list of items
missing from Decedent’s home. (FAC, ¶ 166.) For her part, Defendant Miller was
a co-conspirator of Defendant SRF and its monastics. (FAC, ¶ 53.) The trier of
fact could conclude that the alleged conversion furthered the Defendants’
conspiracy to wrongfully obtain Decedent’s personal property. Given the
foregoing, the court overrules the demurrer for this cause of action.
Sixth Cause of
Action – Violation of Penal Code section 496
            Penal Code section 496 concerns the
receipt of stolen property. The elements for this cause of action are as
follows: (1) the property has been stolen, (2) the accused received it, and (3)
and the accused knew the property was stolen. (People v. Stuart (1969)
272 Cal.App.2d 653, 656.) 
            Defendant Miller argues the FAC
lacks factual allegations to support this claim against her. The court
disagrees. Again, Plaintiff alleges in part that Defendant SRF’s monastics and
agents stole Decedent’s personal property from her home in January 2019, loaded
the personal property into vans owned by Defendant SRF, and transported the
personal property to Defendant SRF’s headquarters. (FAC, ¶ 143.) Moreover,
Defendant SRF allegedly received the personal property. (FAC, ¶ 144.) Plaintiff
has further provided a list of items missing from Decedent’s home. (FAC, ¶
166.) For her part, Defendant Miller was a co-conspirator of Defendant SRF and
its monastics. (FAC, ¶ 53.) The trier of fact could conclude that the alleged
receipt of stolen property furthered the Defendants’ conspiracy to wrongfully
obtain Decedent’s personal property. Thus, the court overrules the demurrer for
this cause of action.
Eighth Cause of
Action – Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress
            The elements for this cause of action are
as follows: “(1) outrageous conduct by the defendant, (2) intention to cause or
reckless disregard of the probability of causing emotional distress, (3) severe
emotional suffering and (4) actual and proximate causation of the emotional
distress.” (Bogard v. Employers Casualty Co. (1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 602,
616.) 
            Defendant Miller makes the case that
the court should sustain her demurrer for this cause of action because Plaintiff
does not attribute the alleged outrageous conduct to Defendant Miller. But the
allegation applies to all Defendants, including Defendant Miller. (FAC, ¶ 267.)
Defendant Miller also argues her alleged misconduct did not cause Decedent’s
emotional distress. But Plaintiff alleges that Decedent suffered severe
emotional distress from Defendants’ (including Defendant Miller) outrageous
conduct, which Decedent contemporaneously reported. (FAC, ¶¶ 267, 268.) This is
sufficient for pleading purposes. Thus, the court overrules the demurrer for
this cause of action.
CONCLUSION 
Based
on the foregoing, the court overrules Defendant Miller’s demurrer.
Defendant
shall file and serve her answer within 20 days.
Defendant
shall give notice.
