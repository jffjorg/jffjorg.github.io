And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a demurrer filed by defendant Alisa Miller Fein to the first amended complaint (FAC) filed by plaintiff Andrew Leavenworth on behalf of the decedent, Joan Wight. The FAC alleges conspiracy, financial elder abuse, conversion, violation of Penal Code section 496, and intentional infliction of emotional distress against defendant Miller and other defendants. The court finds that the FAC sufficiently alleges a conspiracy in which defendant Miller participated, and that it alleges facts to justify holding her liable for the misconduct of others. The court also finds that the FAC alleges the necessary elements for the causes of action of financial elder abuse, conversion, and violation of Penal Code section 496, and that it alleges the necessary elements for the cause of action of intentional infliction of emotional distress. Therefore, the court overrules the demurrer and allows the FAC to proceed.
