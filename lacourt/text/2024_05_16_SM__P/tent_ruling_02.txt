Plaintiff’s OSC
Re: Preliminary Injunction– UNOPPOSED 
 
This is an OSC for
a preliminary injunction to stop defendant borrower from dissipating rents from
the subject property. The underlying action alleges borrower failed to pay back
the amount owed under the parties’ agreement for a loan of $6,150,000. No
opposition has been filed. 
 
A preliminary
injunction will issue if 1) moving party is likely to suffer greater injury
from a denial than the non-moving party is likely to suffer from its grant, and
2) a reasonable probability that the moving party will prevail on the merits. IT
Corp. v. County of Imperial (1983) 35 Cal.3d 63, 69-70. When a strong
showing is made on one of these two elements, the showing as to the other
element does not need to be as strong. Right Site Coalition v. Los Angeles
Unified School District (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 336, 339. A preliminary
injunction will only be issued if money damages would be an inadequate remedy. Tahoe
Keys Prop. Owners’ Assoc. v. State Water Resources Control Bd. (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th
1459, 1471. 
 
A preliminary
injunction is generally designed to preserve the status quo, but a preliminary
injunction that to some extent alters the status quo can be issued in “extreme
cases where the right thereto is clearly established.”  Integrated Dynamic Solutions, Inc. v.
Vitavet Labs, Inc. (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 1178, 1184. 
 
The plaintiff
seeks relief, arguing it will face irreparable harm, and asks the court to order
a preliminary injunction to protect plaintiff’s rights and interest in the subject
property. The plaintiff demonstrates it would likely face a greater injury from
a denial than defendant without appointment of a receiver. Plaintiff contends
that without a receiver, borrower will simply utilize the interim period to
continue to collect rent, not pay property taxes, and otherwise fail to fulfill
financial and other obligations associated with the property. Nutz Decl. ¶ 22. 
 
Defendants do not
file opposition. GRANTED.
