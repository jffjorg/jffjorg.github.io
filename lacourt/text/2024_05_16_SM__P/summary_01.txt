And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying defendants' motion for an undertaking of $56,000 from the plaintiff. The plaintiff was injured in a go-karting accident at the defendants' property when she was 12 years old. The defendants argue that they present a reasonable possibility of prevailing, but the court finds that they have not provided sufficient evidence to support this claim. The court grants the plaintiff's request for sanctions is denied as the plaintiff did not provide the opportunity to withdraw the motion under the 21-day safe harbor period.
