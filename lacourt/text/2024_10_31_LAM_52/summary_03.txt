The judge has ruled that Fred Loya Insurance Company's motion for an order permitting service by publication on defendant Christian Raymond Naranjo is granted. The plaintiff has shown that they have exercised reasonable diligence in attempting to serve the defendant, but have been unable to do so due to the defendant's unknown whereabouts. The plaintiff hired a process server to serve the defendant at his last known home address, but the process server was unable to locate the defendant. A second address for the defendant was subsequently found, but the unit was vacant. The judge finds good cause to permit service by publication and will sign the proposed order submitted by the plaintiff.
