Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Maureen Martinez vs. Armine Ambartsumyan. Martinez moves to compel Ambartsumyan to answer questions at a deposition, to testify at a second day of deposition, and to produce documents. The judge finds that Martinez adequately met and conferred with Ambartsumyan's counsel regarding the deposition, but did not meet and confer regarding the document requests. The judge grants Martinez's motion to compel Ambartsumyan to answer three specific questions and to testify at a second day of deposition. The judge orders Ambartsumyan to be available for deposition no later than November 18, 2024. The judge also finds that both sides acted with substantial justification and therefore denies requests for sanctions.
