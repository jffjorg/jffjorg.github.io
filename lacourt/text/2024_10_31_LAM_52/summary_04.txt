And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to quash the service of process. The plaintiff, Brett Stettner, on behalf of the Estate of Suzi G. Stettner, failed to prove valid service of summons on the defendant, Coastal Health Care, Inc. dba Brentwood Health Care Center. The proof of service, which attested to personal service via Mitchel Taylor, was insufficient because Taylor was not authorized to accept service on behalf of Coastal. Additionally, the proof of service was also insufficient for substituted service because the process server did not attest to mailing a copy of the documents to the person to be served after leaving the documents with Taylor. Therefore, the judge has quashed the service of the summons on the defendant.
