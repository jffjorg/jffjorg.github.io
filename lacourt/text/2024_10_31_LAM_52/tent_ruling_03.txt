 Case Number:  24STCV10378    Hearing Date:   October 31, 2024    Dept:  52 Plaintiff
Fred Loya Insurance Company’s Motion for Order for Service by Publication 
            Plaintiff
Fred Loya Insurance Company moves for an order permitting service by
publication on defendant Christian Raymond Naranjo.  Code of Civil Procedure section 415.50
provides, “A summons may be served by publication if upon affidavit it appears
to the satisfaction of the court in which the action is pending that the party
to be served cannot with reasonable diligence be served in another manner
specified in this article.”
Plaintiff shows to the satisfaction of the court
that defendant Naranjo cannot with reasonable diligence be served in another
manner.  Plaintiff submitted a
declaration stating it hired Concept Investigations, Inc. to serve the
complaint on defendant.  (Kandarian-Stein
Decl., ¶ 6.)  At defendant’s last known
home address, a resident informed the process server that defendant no longer
lived there.  (Id., ¶ 7; Turner
Decl.)  Plaintiff found a second address
for defendant, but the unit was vacant. 
(Kandarian-Stein Decl., ¶¶ 9-10; Turner Decl.)  
Plaintiff has exercised reasonable diligence.  Plaintiff has been unable to serve
defendant.  The court finds good cause to
permit service by publication.
Disposition
Plaintiff Fred Loya Insurance Company’s motion for
an order permitting service by publication is granted.  The court will
sign the proposed order plaintiff submitted on form LASC LACIV 145.
