And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel production of documents and deposition filed by plaintiff Marcelino Diaz. The motion is granted in part. The defendant, Blue Cross of California dba Anthem Blue Cross, is ordered to produce all documents, including screenshots from its PEGA system and metadata for all audio recordings, in accordance with its statements of compliance in response to demands for inspection Nos. 1, 3, and 4, within 20 days.

The judge also found that Anthem did not serve a valid objection to the deposition and that its attempt to postpone the deposition until after cross-defendants appear in the action is reasonable. The court will not order Anthem to produce its deponent until it rules on Anthem's motion for protective order.

The judge denied the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions against Anthem and its counsel, finding that Anthem acted with substantial justification and tried in good faith to produce responsive documents and work with the plaintiff on scheduling the depositions.
