Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted defendant USA Express Legal & Investigative Services, Inc.'s motion for terminating sanctions against plaintiffs Lydia Fuller and Isela Linares, and has awarded monetary sanctions against them in the amount of $2,750.00. The motion for terminating sanctions against plaintiff Bianca Nicole Basilio is denied. The judge found that Fuller and Linares failed to serve further responses and pay monetary sanctions as ordered by the court, and that their failure was not caused by willfulness or bad faith. The judge also found that Basileo complied with the court's order and provided verified supplemental responses. The judge noted that terminating sanctions are a drastic measure and should only be ordered when there has been previous noncompliance with a rule or order and it appears a less severe sanction would not be effective.
