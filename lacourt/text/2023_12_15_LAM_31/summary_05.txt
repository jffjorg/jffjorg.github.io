And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling of Judge Kerry Bensinger grants Defendant JPMorgan Chase Bank's motion to expunge the lis pendens recorded by Plaintiff Joseph Salazar on the residence at 1250 King Lake Dr., Diamond Bar, California. The Court finds that the pleading does not state a real property claim and therefore has jurisdiction to hear the motion. The Court also awards attorney's fees of $942 to be paid by Plaintiff within 30 days. The motion was filed on October 13, 2023, and the opposition and reply were filed subsequently. The Court granted judicial notice of 28 documents and conducted a limited "demurrer-like" analysis of the pleading. The Court finds that the pleading does not state a real property claim, and the available remedy for the claims is limited to monetary damages.
