And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration and request for a reasonable accommodation. The plaintiff, acting in pro per, filed a notice of association of counsel and requested that a different judge hear the motion. The Court denied this request, citing the lack of a "same judge" requirement in Section 1008, subdivision (b) of the Code of Civil Procedure. The plaintiff also requested 45 minutes as a reasonable accommodation to address the Court, but the Court denied this request as well, citing the lack of a medical condition necessitating the accommodation. The Court also addressed the plaintiff's assertion that the October 2, 2023 Order was "ghostwritten and researched by judicial assistant Araxi Gindzhkan", stating that this assertion is unsupported and false.
