 Case Number:  23STCV15229    Hearing Date:   December 15, 2023    Dept:  31 Tentative Ruling  Judge Kerry Bensinger, Department 31   HEARING DATE: December 15, 2023   TRIAL DATE:  Not set  CASE:   Joseph Salazar v. First American Title Insurance Co., et al.  CASE NO.:    23STCV15229    MOTION TO EXPUNGE LIS PENDENS   MOVING PARTY: Defendant JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.  RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Joseph Salazar   I. BACKGROUND  On June 30, 2023, Plaintiff, Joseph Salazar1, filed a Judicial Council form complaint, against Defendants, First American Title Insurance Co. and Urbana Bonnie Footte, for taking a loan out on the residence at 1250 King Lake Dr., Diamond Bar, California 91765 (the “Subject Property”) without Plaintiff’s consent.  On July 25, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), alleging causes of action for (1) Negligence and (2) Intentional Tort.  The FAC adds JP Morgan Chase Bank (“Chase”) as a defendant.  On October 13, 2023, Chase filed this motion to expunge the lis pendens2 recorded by Plaintiff on the Subject Property.  Chase seeks attorney’s fees and costs from Plaintiff for bringing this motion.    Plaintiff filed an opposition.  Chase replied.3   II. LEGAL STANDARD ¿ Under CCP § 405.30, at any time after a notice of pendency of action has been recorded, any party with an interest in the real property may apply to the Court to expunge the notice. A Lis Pendens may be expunged either under CCP § 405.31 if the pleadings do not contain a real property claim; or under CCP § 405.32 if the Court finds that the party claiming the Lis Pendens has not established by a preponderance of the evidence the probable validity of the real property claim. Under CCP § 405.30, the party claiming the Lis Pendens has the burden of proof under sections 405.31 and 405.32. The moving party has the burden of demonstrating that their pleadings contain a real property claim and that the probable validity of their real property claim can be established by a preponderance of the evidence.¿  III. JUDICIAL NOTICE  Chase requests judicial notice of twenty-eight documents.  The unopposed requests are GRANTED.  (Evid. Code, § 452, subds. (c), (d), (g).)    IV. DISCUSSION  First, the Court undertakes a limited “demurrer-like” analysis of whether the pleading states a real property claim, defined by CCP § 405.4 as causes of action which would, if meritorious, affect title to, or the right to possession of, specific real property. (Code Civ. Proc., § 405.4; See Kirkeby v. Superior Court (2004) 33 Cal.4th 642, 647.)¿ ¿ On review of the Complaint, the Court finds that the pleading does not state a real property claim within the definition of CCP § 405.4.  The Complaint asserts two causes of action for General Negligence and Intentional Tort against Defendants for allegedly taking out a loan on the Subject Property without Plaintiff’s consent.  As Chase correctly points out, neither claim constitutes a real property claim.  Indeed, the available remedy for both claims is limited to monetary damages.  (See Civ. Code § 3333; see also CACI 3900.)    Plaintiff does not address this argument.  Rather, he argues that this Court does not have jurisdiction to hear this motion because Plaintiff filed a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy Petition.  As such, this action is automatically stayed pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 362(k).  This argument lacks merit.  Chase provides evidence to show that there is no current bankruptcy proceedings.  (See Reply, Request for Judicial Notice (RJN), Nos. 27 and 28.)  Specifically, Plaintiff’s bankruptcy petition was dismissed on October 25, 2023 for failure to file schedules, statements, and/or plan.  (RJN No. 28.)  The automatic stay was also vacated.  (Id.) Chase is entitled to an order expunging the lis pendens.  Attorney’s Fees  Chase seeks attorney’s fees for bringing this motion.  “Section 405.38 changed the law by requiring (as opposed to merely authorizing) a court to award attorney's fees and costs to the party prevailing on a motion to expunge, unless the other party acted with substantial justification or other circumstances would make such an award unjust.”  (Shoker v. Superior Ct. of Alameda Cnty. (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 271, 280, italics in original.)  Here, Chase is the prevailing party.  Accordingly, the Court awards attorney’s fees of $942, consisting of two hours at defense counsel’s hourly rate and the $60 filing fee.    IV. CONCLUSION  The motion to expunge the lis pendens is Granted.  Defendant JPMorgan Chase Bank is awarded attorney’s fees in the sum of $942 to be paid by Plaintiff within 30 days of this order.   Moving party to give notice.    Dated:   December 15, 2023    ¿ ¿¿¿ ¿ ¿ Kerry Bensinger¿¿ ¿ Judge of the Superior Court¿
