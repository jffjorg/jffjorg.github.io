And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Gregory Langadinos' motion for reconsideration of the Court's denial of his motion for leave to file a first amended complaint. The Plaintiff filed his original complaint on December 16, 2019, and was denied leave to amend on October 2, 2023. The Plaintiff argues that the Court's decision was erroneous and that the Court violated the Judicial Code of Conduct by allowing a judicial assistant to write and research the order. The Plaintiff also argues that the Court did not apply a liberal standard for pro se pleadings and that the order is biased and discriminatory against the Plaintiff as a disabled person. The Court finds that the Plaintiff's arguments lack merit and that the Plaintiff has failed to present new or different facts, circumstances, or law warranting a different result. The Court concludes that the Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration is denied.
