And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendant, The Regents of the University of California, to the First Amended Complaint filed by the plaintiff, Arami Cheyenne Walker. The plaintiff claims that the defendant's use of her photographic images without her consent was unauthorized and constitutes a violation of her rights under Civil Code section 3344.

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the First Cause of Action for Appropriation, holding that the use of the plaintiff's images was not commercial in purpose and therefore does not constitute a violation of Civil Code section 3344. The judge has also sustained the demurrer to the Second Cause of Action for Breach of Contract, holding that the defendant did not breach the contract because the use of the plaintiff's images was not defamatory.

The judge has overruled the demurrer to the Third Cause of Action for Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress, holding that the plaintiff's claim is defective because it fails to allege a direct victim or bystander who witnessed the injury.

The judge has granted the plaintiff leave to amend the Second Cause of Action for Breach of Contract and has ordered the plaintiff to file and serve a Second Amended Complaint within 30 days. The judge has also ordered the defendant to file and serve a responsive pleading within 30 days of service of the amended pleading. The motion to strike is moot.
