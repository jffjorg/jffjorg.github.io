MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff Gregory Langadinos
 
RESPONDING
PARTY:     Defendant
Ronald S. MacDonald
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On December
16, 2019, Plaintiff, Gregory Langadinos,[1]who
is self-represented, filed a form complaint against Defendants, Ronald S.
MacDonald (“MacDonald”) and Monica K. Kramer (“Kramer”), asserting a cause of
action for motor vehicle negligence.  Kramer
was dismissed from this action on May 11, 2021. 

            
            On February
24, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”)
to add new defendants and causes of action.  On October 2, 2023, after taking the matter under
submission, the Court denied the motion for leave to amend because of
substantive and procedural defects.  
 
            On October
16, 2023, Plaintiff filed this motion for reconsideration pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure[2]
section 1008, subdivision (b).[3]
[4]

 
            On November
21, 2023, Defendants filed an opposition. Defendants request sanctions.
 
            On November
30, 2023, Plaintiff replied.
 
II.        LEGAL
STANDARD
 
            “When an
application for an order has been made to a judge, or to a court, and refused
in whole or in part, or granted, or granted conditionally, or on terms, any
party affected by the order may, within 10 days after service upon the party of
written notice of entry of the order and based upon new or different facts,
circumstances, or law, make application to the same judge or court that made
the order, to reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior
order.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1008, subd. (a).)  “A party seeking
reconsideration also must provide a satisfactory explanation for the failure to
produce the evidence at an earlier time. [Citation.]”¿ (New York Times Co.
v. Superior Court (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 206, 212.)¿¿A motion for
reconsideration is properly denied where it is based on evidence that could
have been presented in connection with the original motion.  (Morris v.
AGFA Corp. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1452, 1460.)   
 
            “The
statutory provisions relating to motions for renewal (i.e., subsequent
applications for the same order) are found in section 1008, subdivision
(b).”  (Graham v. Hansen (1982) 128 Cal.App.3d 965, 970.)  “A
party who originally made an application for an order which was refused in
whole or part, or granted conditionally or on terms, may make a subsequent
application for the same order upon new or different facts, circumstances, or
law, in which case it shall be shown by affidavit what application was made
before, when and to what judge, what order or decisions were made, and what new
or different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown.”  (Code
Civ. Proc. § 1008, subd. (b).)  “These provisions contain no requirement
that a motion for renewal be made within the 10-day time period as is required
for motions for reconsideration.”  (Graham, supra, 128
Cal.App.3d at p. 970.) 
 
III.       DISCUSSION
 
            A.  Timeliness 
            
            “When an application
for an order has been made to a judge, or to a court, and refused in whole or
in part, or granted, or granted conditionally, or on terms, any party affected
by the order may, within 10 days after service upon the party of written notice
of entry of the order and based upon new or different facts, circumstances, or
law, make application to the same judge or court that made the order, to
reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior order.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 1008, subd. (a).)           
            
            “The
statutory provisions relating to motions for renewal (i.e., subsequent
applications for the same order) are found in section 1008, subdivision
(b).” (Graham, supra, 128 Cal.App.3d at p. 970.)  “These
provisions contain no requirement that a motion for renewal be made within the
10-day time period as is required for motions for reconsideration.” (Id.)
 
            Plaintiff
brings this motion for pursuant to Section 1008, subdivision (b).  Accordingly, the Court construes this motion
as a motion for renewal.  As a renewed
motion, Plaintiff’s motion is timely. 
 
            B.  Analysis
 
            “A party
who originally made an application for an order which was refused in whole or
part, or granted conditionally or on terms, may make a subsequent application
for the same order upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law,
in which case it shall be shown by affidavit what application was made before,
when and to what judge, what order or decisions were made, and what new or
different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown.”  (Code
Civ. Proc. § 1008, subd. (b), emphasis added.)   
 
            Plaintiff brings
this renewed motion for leave to file an amended complaint.  As best as the Court can tell, Plaintiff
seeks reconsideration for the following reasons: 
 
1.     
Erroneous facts;
2.     
This Court violated the Judicial
Code of Conduct by (1) allowing a judicial assistant to write and research the
October 2, 2023 order in an effort to conserve judicial resources, (2) failing
to apply a liberal standard for pro se pleadings in denying Plaintiff leave to amend,
and (3) adopting an order that is biased and discriminates against Plaintiff as
a disabled person.
3.     
Relief from the October 2, 2023
Order under Section 473 is warranted.
 
            Plaintiff ‘s
arguments lack merit.  None of the
foregoing reasons are “new or different facts, circumstances, or law” as
required by Section 1008, subdivision (b). 
“A motion made in accordance with section 1008 must include reference to
new or different facts, circumstances, or law before the earlier order may be
reconsidered.”  (In re Marriage of
Oropallo (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 997, 1002.) 
 Plaintiff does not explain what “erroneous
facts” are at issue. Or how they are relevant to the Court’s consideration of
the renewal motion.   
 
            Moreover,
the Court is cognizant that leave to amend is liberally granted.  As stated in the Court’s October 2, 2023
order, “[t]he liberal policy of granting leave to amend at any stage of the
proceedings applies only where no prejudice is shown to the adverse party. (Melican,
supra, 151 Cal.App.4th at p. 175.).”  The Court considered Plaintiff’s arguments
and expressly found that the prejudice to Defendants would be extreme if leave
were granted. 
 
            Last,
Plaintiff again invokes Section 473 to seek relief from the October 2, 2023
order.  The arguments are not new.  They were raised and rejected previously.  A key aspect of the discretionary relief
provision of Section 473 is the determination of prejudice to the opposing
party. (Zamora v. Calyborn Contracting Group, Inc. (2002) 28 Cal.4th 249,
258.)  As mentioned above, the Court
found that Defendants would be prejudiced by the proposed amendments.  The Court also found that Plaintiff did not
explain the delay in seeking leave to amend. 
 
            The Court
considered the evidence and the arguments Plaintiff presented in connection to
his motion for leave to amend.  The Court
issued its ruling denying the motion.[5]  Plaintiff fails to present new or different
facts, circumstances, or law warranting a different result pursuant to section
1008(b).
            
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
            Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion, construed as a motion for
renewal, is DENIED.
 
            Moving
party to give notice, unless waived.
