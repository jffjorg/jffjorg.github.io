And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the defendant's motion for attorney's fees and costs, as well as the plaintiff's opposition and reply. The defendant is seeking $78,015.00 in attorney's fees and $3,499.23 in costs, which were incurred in defending against the plaintiff's lawsuit. The parties entered into a joint venture agreement, which was found to be unenforceable by the Court.

The Court finds that the defendant is entitled to attorney's fees under California Civil Code Section 1717(a), which provides that the prevailing party in "any action on a contract" shall be awarded reasonable attorney's fees incurred to enforce that contract where the contract specifically provides for attorney's fees. The joint venture agreement provides for the prevailing party to be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees and costs in conforming and executing upon the award.

The Court also finds that the fees and costs sought by the defendant are reasonable, given the complexity of the case and the amount of work required to defend against the plaintiff's claims.

Accordingly, the Court grants the defendant's motion for attorney's fees and costs.
