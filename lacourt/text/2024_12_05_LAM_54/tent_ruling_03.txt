District Attorney George Gascon and City of Los Angeles
Responding Party: Plaintiff Meldoy Rogers

DEFENDANT TO NOTICE. 
 
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, please
email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with
notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the
day of the hearing.
 
The Court considers the moving papers
and opposition.
 
Defendant moves to declare Plaintiff a
vexatious litigant. Defendant filed a notice of non-opposition on November 25,
2024. Plaintiff filed an untimely “objection” to the motion on December 2,
2024. Given the extreme remedy requested in the motion, the Court will consider
Plaintiff’s late filed opposition. The Court will continue the hearing and
allow Defendant to file and serve a reply. The Case Management Conference is
continued to the same date and time.
