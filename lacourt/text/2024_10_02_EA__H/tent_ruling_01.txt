Specifically, the plaintiffs in the lead case (Case No. 23PSCV00325), Zhenni Zou (“Zou”) and Xiaoye Cui (“Cui”) (together, “Zou/Cui”), allege that Qian Yu (“Yu”) converted a company truck for her own use and benefit and that material disagreements between Zou/Cui and Yu have led to the mismanagement of company assets. Zou/Cui thus have sued Yu for conversation and dissolution of corporation. In Yu’s own lawsuit (Case No. 23STCV02756), Yu alleges that Zou/Cai set up a separate company, CSZ Logistics, Inc. (“CSZ”), and that Zou/Cai improperly transferred the entire business of CC Express to CSZ without Yu’s consent. Yu thus has sued Zou/Cui, CC Express, and CSZ for, among other causes of action, breach of fiduciary duty, conversation, breach of oral contract, unfair competition, and unfair enrichment. On April 3, 2023, the Clerk entered default against CC Express in Case No. 23STC02756. On July 5, 2023, Case Nos. 23PSCV00325 and 23STCV02756 were deemed related, and Case No. 23PSCV00325 was designated as the lead case. On February 13, 2024, Zou/Cui filed a Derivative First Amended Complaint in Case No. 23PSCV00325, asserting causes of action against Yu and Does 1-50 and Nominal Defendant CC Express for (1) conversion and (2) dissolution of Corporation Pursuant to California Corporations Code § 1800 et seq.On March 12, 2024, the Court ordered CSZ’s answer stricken and default entered in Case No. 23STCV02756.On April 9, 2024, the Clerk entered default against Yu in Case No. 23PSCV00325. On May 9, 2024, the Court consolidated Case Nos. 23PSCV00325 and 23STCV02756 for all purposes and designated Case No. 23PSCV00325 as the lead case. A Mandatory Settlement Conference is set for November 7, 2024. A Post-Mediation Status Conference and Further Case Management Conference is set for December 11, 2024. Pending before the Court are two discovery motions filed by Zou in the case brought by Yu against Zou (Case No. 23STC02756). Specifically, Zou moves (1) for an order establishing requests for admissions and (2) to compel responses to form interrogatories. At the last Case Management Conference on August 8, 2024, the Court ordered Zou to re-file the motions under the lead case number (Case No. 23PSCV00325) since the cases had been consolidated. On August 9, 2024, Zou re-filed the motions as requested. To date, Yu has not filed any opposition or response to either motion. For the reasons stated herein, the Court grants both motions and awards sanctions against Yu in the amount of $360 per motion, for a total of $720. II.      Legal Standards A response to requests for admission is due 30 days after service.
