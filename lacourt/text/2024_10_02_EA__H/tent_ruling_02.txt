 Case Number:  23PSCV03996    Hearing Date:   October 2, 2024    Dept:  H Deuschel
v. Atlas Springs Company, Inc., et al., Case No. 23PSCV03996
The hearing on Defendants Atlas
Springs Company, Inc.’s and Fernando Gutierrez’s Demurrer to Plaintiff’s
Complaint is CONTINUED to December 13, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.

Background
Plaintiff
Michael Deuschel (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows:
Plaintiff owns a 1998 Dodge B3500 converted
camper-van (the “subject vehicle”) that serves as his dwelling. Plaintiff
contracted with Atlas Springs Company, Inc. (“Atlas Springs”) to repair the
subject vehicle in June 2021. Altas Springs’ Chief Executive Officer is
Fernando Gutierrez (“Gutierrez”). When Plaintiff complained about Atlas
Springs’ failed products and workmanship, Atlas Springs stole the subject
vehicle and extorted him to sign a liability release before they would release
the subject vehicle to him.
On
December 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint, asserting causes of action
against Atlas Springs, Gutierrez and Does 1-20 for:
1.       Breach
of Contract;
2.       Negligent
Repair;
3.       Product
Liability;
4.       Personal
Injury;
5.       The
Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 121011 et seq.;
6.       California
Civil Code § 51 et seq., The Unruh Civil Rights Act;
7.       Negligence;
and
8.       Intentional
and Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress.

A
Case Management Conference is set for October 2, 2024.

Discussion
Atlas
Springs and Gutierrez demur, per Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, to
Plaintiff’s complaint, on the basis that it fails to state facts sufficient to
constitute causes of action and is uncertain.
The
Court continues the hearing on the demurrer to December 13, 2024, at 8:30
a.m. Code of Civil Procedure Section 430.41 requires a demurring party in
certain civil actions, before filing the demurrer, to engage in a specified
meet and confer process with the party who filed the pleading demurred to for
the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached as to the filing
of an amended pleading that would resolve the objections to be raised in the
demurrer.
The
Court notes that a “Declaration of Patricia Rodriguez Re: Meet and Confer” was
filed on behalf of Gutierrez on July 11, 2024. Rodriguez advised therein,
without more, that she was retained by Gutierrez and was unable to meet and
confer five days in advance of filing the demurrer to the complaint. Rodriguez
filed the instant demurrer on behalf of both defendants on August 15, 2024. The
instant demurrer is not accompanied by any meet and confer declaration
whatsoever. Rodriguez’s obligation to meet and confer is not excused on the
basis that Plaintiff is self-represented.
Rodriguez
(or other counsel at Rodriguez Law Group, Inc.) must file a declaration in
compliance with Code of Civil Procedure § 430.41 at least nine court days prior
to the continued hearing date. 
Rodriguez
(or other counsel at Rodriguez Law Group, Inc.) is instructed to provide notice
of the continued hearing date to Plaintiff forthwith and to file proof of
service of said notice at least nine court days prior to the continued hearing
date.
