Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by defendant George Liu to the complaint filed by plaintiff Loa Int'l (USA) Transport Co. Inc. The court has sustained the demurrer in its entirety, with leave to amend. This means that the plaintiff's complaint does not adequately state a cause of action for breach of contract, intentional interference with contractual relations, intentional interference with prospective economic relations, violation of California Unfair Competition Law, and trade secret misappropriation.

The court has also deemed defendant's motion to strike portions of the complaint moot, as the demurrer has been sustained and the plaintiff will need to amend its complaint to state a cause of action.

The court's ruling is based on the facts of the case, including the allegations made by the plaintiff and the defendant's demurrer. The court has considered the legal standards and precedents applicable to the causes of action alleged by the plaintiff and has determined that the plaintiff's complaint fails to adequately state a cause of action for each of the causes of action alleged.

English text:
This is a breach of contract action between Loa Int’l (USA) Transport Co. Inc. and its former employee George Liu. The case is set for a hearing on September 27, 2023. George Liu has filed a demurrer to Loa's complaint and a motion to strike. The court has sustained George Liu's demurrer with leave to amend and deemed his motion to strike moot. The case arises from George Liu's alleged email to RL Jones, a customs brokerage and international logistics company in Texas, posing as a current employee of Loa to obtain Loa's pricing and attempt to secure RL Jones as a customer. George Liu also allegedly disclosed Loa's pricing to RL Jones. Loa has alleged several causes of action, including breach of contract, intentional interference with contractual relations, intentional interference with prospective economic relations, violation of California Unfair Competition Law, trade secret misappropriation, and common law trademark infringement. However, the court has found that Loa has failed to adequately plead several of these causes of action, and George Liu's demurrer is sustained with leave to amend.
