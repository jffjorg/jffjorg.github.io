## English Summary

The tentative ruling in this case concerns a personal injury lawsuit filed by Hiram Muro against United Towing & Transport Inc. and Henry Hernandez. 

Muro alleges that Hernandez, while operating a tow truck, caused him to fall and sustain severe injuries by raising the flatbed truck to an unsafe height. The defendants demurred to Muro's complaint, arguing that he failed to state a cause of action for motor vehicle negligence and that they were not subject to the higher standard of care for common carriers. 

The judge overruled the demurrer, finding that Muro sufficiently alleged Hernandez operated the flatbed negligently and that his claims did not require specific facts regarding common carrier status. 

The judge also denied the defendants' motion to strike Muro's allegations regarding common carrier liability, stating that pleading ultimate facts is sufficient. 

The defendants are now required to answer the First Amended Complaint within ten days.
