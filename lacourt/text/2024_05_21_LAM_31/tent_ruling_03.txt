MOTIONS
TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO DISCOVERY 



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
John E. Bouzane dba Fast Eviction Service
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendants PAMA
Management Inc.
 
 
 
On December 8, 2023, Plaintiff, John E. Bouzane dba Fast
Eviction Service, filed motions to compel Defendants and Cross-Complainants,
PAMA Management Inc. and Golden Management Services, Inc., to provide further
responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set One, Nos.
1-27, 30-38 40, 45-74, and 77-81.
 
On January 4, 2024, the court continued the motions to allow
the parties to participate in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC). 
 
On January 24, 2024, the court held an IDC with the
parties.  The issues were not resolved.  The court directed counsel to meet and confer
re: five topics no later than February 5, 2024 and ordered Counsel for
Plaintiff to prepare and submit a Notice of Outcome within five court days
following the meet and confer.  To date,
Plaintiff has not filed a Notice of Outcome. 
 
On April 17, 2024, Defendants filed their oppositions to
Plaintiff’s motions.  In the oppositions,
Defendants argue the motions should be denied because after the IDC, Defendants
produced thousands of documents that were responsive to Plaintiff’s Request for
Production of Documents.  Thereafter,
Counsel for Defendants contacted Plaintiff’s Counsel to inquire whether the
document production satisfied Plaintiff in order to take these motions off
calendar.  Plaintiff’s Counsel advised he
would respond in a few days, however, to do date, Plaintiff’s Counsel has not
indicated whether Plaintiff will be moving forward with these motions.
 
On April 29, 2024, the parties filed a stipulation to
continue the motions to allow Defendants to provide further responses. 
The motions came on for hearing on April 30, 2024.  The parties’ April 29, 2024 stipulation did
not appear in the court’s electronic file in advance of the hearing.  As such, the court issued a tentative order ruling
that the motions were moot based on Defendants’ oppositions.  Plaintiff’s counsel appeared at the
hearing.  Based on oral representations,
the court continued the motions to May 21, 2024 and ordered the parties to
submit supplemental briefing no later than May 14, 2024.
 
As of May 14, 2024, the parties had not submitted
supplemental briefing.  However, on May
17, 2024, counsel for Plaintiff filed a declaration re: status of
discovery.  Paragraph 7 is
incomplete.  Paragraph 8 is
incomprehensible.  The parties appear to
request additional time to meet and confer. 
Given the parties failure to frame the issues and apprise the court of
the status, the motions will be continued again.  The court will hear from the parties re:
dates and scheduling. 
 
Clerk of the Court to give notice.
