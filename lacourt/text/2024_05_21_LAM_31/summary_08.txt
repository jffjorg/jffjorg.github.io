And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling issued by Judge Kerry Bensinger on May 21, 2024, grants the motion to quash the deposition subpoena for production of business records to Roche Diagnostics Corporation in part. The court modifies the subpoena to seek records from February 2012 to February 2022. The central issue in the case is when the look-back period should commence, and the court rules out both the present day and the date of the incident. The court selects the date of hire (February 2020) as the look-back period, as it makes sense to learn about relevant issues concerning Plaintiff's employment prior to being hired by GRAIL. The court also notes that including the time Plaintiff worked at GRAIL would reduce the relevant look-back period to eight years, not ten.
