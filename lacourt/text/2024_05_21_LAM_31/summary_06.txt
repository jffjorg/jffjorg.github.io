And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is a summary of the court's decision on the demurrer filed by the defendant, Blue Cross of California dba Anthem Blue Cross, to the complaint filed by the plaintiff, Elena Jahnke. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant delayed approving a referral for medical treatment, causing her to suffer a grand mal seizure. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's UCL claim was deficient because it did not allege any unlawful, fraudulent, or unfair acts. The court found that the plaintiff had sufficiently alleged a violation of Insurance Code section 790.03(h)(3) and California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 28 section 1300.67.2.2.

The court rejected the defendant's argument that the plaintiff's UCL claim was deficient because it did not allege any unlawful, fraudulent, or unfair acts. The court found that the plaintiff had sufficiently alleged a violation of section 1300.67.2.2, which requires health care service plans to provide or arrange for the provision of access to health care services in a timely manner. The court also found that the plaintiff had sufficiently alleged a threat of irreparable harm, which is the primary focus of relief under the UCL.

The court overruled the demurrer and ordered the defendant to serve and file its answer to the first amended complaint within 10 days of the date of the order.
