And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court addresses the plaintiff's argument that, as the prevailing party in a FEHA claim, AHF was required to file a noticed motion for a discretionary award of costs. The plaintiff relies on Neeble-Diamond v Hotel California By the Sea, LLC (2024) for this proposition. The court notes that typically, arguments raised for the first time in reply are disregarded, but it addresses the argument here because it is relevant to the issues before the court. The court concludes that, unlike Neeble-Diamond, the plaintiff has responded to AHF's Memorandum of Costs by filing a Motion to Strike and/or Tax Costs, thereby making the issues concerning the merit of the FEHA claim and the intertwining of FEHA and non-FEHA claims squarely before the court.
