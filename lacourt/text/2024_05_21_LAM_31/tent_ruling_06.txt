DEMURRER
WITHOUT MOTION TO STRIKE



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant
Blue Cross of California dba Anthem Blue Cross
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiff Elena
Jahnke
 
 
I.          FACTUAL AND
PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
 
            This action arises from an insurer’s delayed approval of a
referral for medical treatment. On June 16, 2023, Plaintiff, Elena Jahnke,
filed a Complaint against Defendants, Blue Cross of California dba Anthem Blue
Cross (“Anthem”) and Preferred IPA of California (“Preferred IPA”), asserting
causes of action for (1) Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair
Dealing, (2) Breach of Contract, (3) Violations of Business & Professions
Code section 17200, and (4) Negligence.  The
First, Second, and Third Causes of Action are alleged against Anthem.  A copy of the policy is attached to the Complaint.

 
            On November
6, 2023, Anthem filed a demurrer to the First, Second, and Third Causes of
Action of the Complaint, and concurrently filed a motion to strike punitive
damages and attorney fees.  On January
24, 2024, the court overruled the demurrer to the First and Second Causes of
Action and sustained the demurrer to the Third Cause of Action.  The court further granted the motion to
strike as to attorney fees and denied as to punitive damages.  Leave to amend was granted.
 
            The FAC alleges
that Plaintiff had health insurance with Anthem.  Per an agreement between Anthem and its
medical group, Preferred IPA, any referral requests were to be reviewed for
approval or denial by Preferred IPA.  On
June 17, 2022, Plaintiff’s neurosurgeon determined Plaintiff needed prompt
treatment to address arteriovenous malformations on her brain and submitted an
urgent referral for an endovascular surgeon to Preferred IPA.  However, Preferred IPA did not respond to the
referral within 96 hours as required under the policy.  Plaintiff’s request remained pending for six
months.  In that time, Plaintiff’s physical
symptoms worsened.  Defendants eventually
approved the referral only after Plaintiff suffered a grand mal seizure.  
On February 22, 2024, Plaintiff timely filed the First
Amended Complaint (FAC) asserting the same causes of action as the Complaint.
 
            On March
22, 2024, Anthem filed this Demurrer to the Third Cause of Action in the FAC.

            Plaintiff
filed an opposition.  Anthem replied.
 
II.        LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
                A
demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the pleadings and will be sustained
only where the pleading is defective on its face.  (City of Atascadero
v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th
445, 459.)  “We treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or
law.  We accept the factual allegations of the complaint as true and
also consider matters which may be judicially
noticed.  [Citation.]”  (Mitchell v. California Department of
Public Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007; Del E. Webb Corp. v.
Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604 [“the facts alleged
in the pleading are deemed to be true, however improbable they may be”].) 
Allegations are to be liberally construed.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
452.)  In construing the allegations, the court is to give effect to
specific factual allegations that may modify or limit inconsistent general or
conclusory allegations.  (Financial Corporation of America v. Wilburn
(1987) 189 Cal.App.3rd 764, 769.)   
 
            A demurrer
may be brought if insufficient facts are stated to support the cause of action
asserted.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).)  “A demurrer for
uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some respects
uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery
procedures.”  (Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc. (1993) 14
Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)   


            Where the
complaint contains substantial factual allegations sufficiently apprising
defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet, a demurrer for uncertainty
will be overruled or plaintiff will be given leave to amend.  (Williams
v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.) 
Leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of
successful amendment.  (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335,
348.)  The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading
can be amended successfully.  (Ibid.)  
 
III.       DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff’s Third
Cause of Action is a UCL claim.  The UCL
is codified at Business and Professions Code, section 17200 et seq. 
Section 17204 of the UCL provides that a private person “who has suffered
injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of the unfair
competition” may bring a 17200 action.  (Bus. & Prof. Code, §
17204.)  “To bring a UCL claim, a plaintiff must show either an (1)
unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent business act or practice, or (2) unfair,
deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising. [Citation.]  Because the UCL
is written in the disjunctive, it establishes three varieties of unfair
competition—acts or practices which are unlawful, or unfair, or
fraudulent.”  (Adhav v. Midway Rent A Car, Inc. (2019) 37
Cal.App.5th 954, 970, citations and quotations omitted.)  The UCL is “not
an all-purpose substitute for a tort or contract action.”  (Madrid v. Perot Sys. Corp. (2005) 130
Cal.App.4th 440, 452 (citations omitted).)
 
Anthem argues that
Plaintiff’s UCL claim is still deficient for two reasons: (1) Plaintiff does
not allege any unlawful, fraudulent, or unfair acts, and (2) there are no
remedies available. 
 
A.    
Unlawful, Fraudulent, or Unfair Acts
 
“[A]ny ‘unlawful,’
‘unfair’ or ‘fraudulent’ business act or practice is deemed to be unfair
competition.”  (Smith v. State Farm
Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 700, 717.)  As relevant here, “unlawful” conduct is
“anything that can properly be called a business practice and is forbidden by
law.”  (Cel-Tech Commc’ns, Inc. v. Los
Angeles Cellular Tel. Co. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 163, 180.) 
 
Here, Plaintiff’s
UCL claim is based upon alleged violations of Insurance Code section
790.03(h)(3) and California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 28 section
1300.67.2.2.  (See FAC, ¶¶ 26(k) and(l),
40.)  Anthem attacks Insurance Code
section 790.03(h)(3) as inapplicable to Anthem because, as a health care
service plan provider, the Department of Managed Health Care, not the
Department of Insurance govern Anthem. 
The uncontested point has merit. “The Legislature has elected to subject
insurers and health care service plans to distinct regulatory regimes.  Insurers are regulated by the Insurance Code.
… Health care service plans fall under the jurisdiction of the Department of
Managed Care.”  (Smith v. PacifiCare
Behavioral Health of California, Inc. (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 139, 157–58;
see also Bain v. United Healthcare Inc. (N.D. Cal. Aug. 30, 2016) 2016
WL 4529495, at *8 [“The distinction between health and disability insurance is
underscored by the fact that California regulates insurance plans and health
care service plans differently.”]; Blue Cross of California v. Superior
Court (2010) 180 Cal.App,4th 1237, 1242 [noting that Anthem Blue Cross is
“a managed health care service plan subject to the Knox-Keene Act and regulated
by the DMHC.”].)  “A health care service
plan, as defined in Chapter 2.2 (commencing with Section 1340) of Division 2 of
the Health and Safety Code, shall not be subject to this section.”  (Cal. Ins. Code § 740(g).)  The Insurance Code does not apply to Anthem.
 
Anthem next
targets CCR Title 28 section 1300.67.2.2.  Anthem points out Section 1300.67.2.2 does not
authorize a private right of action.  “This
section does not: . . . (c) Create a new cause of action or a new defense to liability
for any person.”  (Cal. Code Regs. tit.
28 § 1300.67.2.2(a)(4)(c).)  As such,
Anthem argues that Plaintiff cannot sustain a UCL claim predicated on violation
of Section 1300.67.2.2.   Anthem’s argument fails.  Plaintiff has not alleged a separate cause of
action pursuant to Section 1300.67.2.2. 
Plaintiff has brought a UCL claim based on a violation of Section
1300.67.2.2.  The “UCL authorizes
lawsuits to remedy unlawful conduct even if the underlying statute that renders
the conduct unlawful does not itself create an independent right of action.”  (Blue Cross of California, Inc. v.
Superior Ct. (2009) 180 Cal.App.4th 1237, 1250.)  Further, Plaintiff has alleged sufficient
facts to state a violation of Section 1300.67.2.2 requires a health care
service plan “to provide or arrange for the provision of access to health care
services in a timely manner.”   In
sustaining, in part, Anthem’s demurrer to the Complaint, the court found that
Plaintiff alleged sufficient facts to show Anthem “did nothing to ensure
Plaintiff received a timely decision on the referral nor did Anthem implement a
policy or procedure to rectify Preferred IPA’s failure to timely act on the
referral. As a result, Plaintiff’s necessary medical treatment was
unnecessarily delayed.”  (Minute Order,
1/24/24.)  Plaintiff sufficiently alleges
a violation of Section 1300.67.2.2 (unlawful act) to invoke the UCL.
 
B.    
Remedies Under the UCL
 
Anthem next
challenges Plaintiff’s entitlement to remedies under the UCL.  Here, Plaintiff seeks restitution and injunctive
relief.  (See FAC, ¶ 43.)  The court focuses on the injunctive relief
claim as it is dispositive of this issue. 

 
Injunctive relief
is the primary focus of relief under the UCL. 
(In re Tobacco II Cases (2009) 46 Cal.4th 298, 319.) In
California, injunctive relief is not available where there is a plain,
complete, speedy and adequate remedy at law.  (See Prudential Home Mortgage Co. Inc. v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1236, 1249-1250 (holding that
equitable relief was unavailable to plaintiff because statutory remedies would
be adequate).  To obtain injunctive
relief, a plaintiff must show a possibility of irreparable harm.  (Bush v. Cal. Conservation Corps (1982)
136 Cal.App.3d 194, 204.)  Irreparable
harm occurs only where pecuniary damages will not afford adequate relief, or it
will be extremely difficult to ascertain the amount that would afford adequate
relief.  (See Civ. Code § 3422.)  Moreover, injunctive relief under the UCL is
appropriate “only when there is a threat of continuing misconduct.”  (Madrid v. Perot Systems Corp. (2005)
130 Cal.App.4th 440, 462-65 (2005); see also Civ. Proc. Code § 526; Gafcon,
Inc. v. Ponsor & Associates (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 1388, 1403 fn. 6 [“injunctive
relief is available to prevent threatened injury and is not a remedy designed
to right completed wrongs . . . Unless there is a showing that the challenged
action is being continued or repeated, an injunction should be denied.”].) 
 
Contrary to Anthem’s
position, Plaintiff alleges sufficient facts to support a request for
injunctive relief.  Plaintiff alleges that
she continues to suffer negative effects from her grand mal seizure and that
Anthem’s practices are ongoing in that she has continued to encounter delays in
her receipt of follow-up care.  (FAC, ¶¶
5, 20, 21.)  These allegations show a threat
of irreparable harm (speedy approval of health care services) that cannot be
remedied by pecuniary damages.  Further,
the threat is ongoing.  Plaintiff
supports her request for injunctive relief under the UCL.
 
 IV.
      CONCLUSION
            
Based on the foregoing, the Demurrer is OVERRULED.
 
Defendant Blue Cross of California dba Anthem Blue Cross is
ordered to serve and file its Answer to the FAC within 10 days of the date of
this order.
 
Plaintiff to give notice, unless waived.
