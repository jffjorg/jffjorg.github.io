  Case Number:  18STCV10177    Hearing Date:   January 17, 2024    Dept:  26 MOTIONS TO
VACATE JUDGMENT(CCP § 663)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff Young Chow Dai’s Motions to Vacate Judgment are
DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS:  
 
On December 31, 2018, Plaintiff
Young Chow Dai (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action against Defendants Paul
P. Cheng & Associates and Marsha S. Mao. Plaintiff filed the operative
Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) on October 4, 2019 against Defendants Paul P.
Cheng (“Defendant Cheng”), Marsha S. Mao (“Defendant Mao”), and Law Offices of
Paul P. Cheng & Associates (“Defendant Cheng & Associates”). The SAC,
which arises from alleged wrongful actions in connection with a settlement
agreement, alleges causes of action for: (1) accounting; and (2) fraud.  
 
On February 7, 2023, Defendant
Cheng filed a motion for summary judgment (“MSJ”). On March 1, 2023, Defendant
Cheng filed a motion to deem the truth of the matters in Defendant’s Requests
for Admission, Set One, served on Plaintiff, admitted and for monetary
sanctions. On April 12, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to transfer venue to the
Santa Monica Courthouse. 
 
On July 24, 2023, after hearing
and oral argument, the Court: (1) granted the MSJ filed by Defendant Cheng; (2)
granted Defendant Cheng’s motion to deem the truth of the matters in
Defendant’s Requests for Admission, Set One, as admitted and awarded Defendant
monetary sanctions; and (3) denied Plaintiff’s motion to transfer and change
venue. (Minute Order, 07/24/23.) On August 4, 2023, Defendant Cheng filed and
served Notice of Entry of Judgment or Order as to the Court’s July 24, 2023
order. 
 
On August 7, 2023, Plaintiff filed
and served the instant Motion to vacate judgment and
enter a new and different judgment (the “Motion”). On August 8, 2023, the
Court entered judgment in favor of Defendant Cheng and against Plaintiff. The
Court’s order for entry of summary judgment provides that “Plaintiff’s case
against Defendant Paul P. Cheng is therefore dismissed with prejudice.” (Minute
Order, 08/08/23, p. 3:1-4.) Plaintiff filed an Amended Motion to Vacate
Judgment and Enter a New and Different Judgment on August 11, 2023. Defendant
filed and served an opposition to the Amended Motion on August 17, 2023. 
 
Plaintiff filed similar motions to
vacate on August 25, 2023 and September 29, 2023. The Court will consider all
three motions to vacate in this ruling. 
 
Discussion
 
The first Motion to Vacate is brought pursuant to
California Code of Civil Procedure section 663. However, this statute “does not
lie to vacate a summary judgment and remit an action for trial.” (Forman v.
Knapp Press (1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 200, 203.) “Rather, section 663 empowers
a trial court, on motion of [a] party . . . entitl[ed] . . . to a different
judgment from that which has been entered to vacate its judgment and enter
another and different judgment.” (Ibid.) Even if the Motion was a
procedurally proper mechanism to set aside the Court’s ruling on the Motion for
Summary Judgment, it would still fail because it does not “specify the
particulars in which the legal basis for the decision is not consistent with or
supported by the facts, or which the judgment or decree is not consistent with
the special verdict.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 663a, subd. (a).) Instead, the Motion
is an incoherent recitation of facts and inapposite authority. In fact, the
Court struggled to find any comprehensible statement therein. Plaintiff has
failed to present any cohesive and comprehensible argument in support of the
Motion. 
Finally, the first Motion is not timely under the
statute. “[T]he power of the court to rule on a motion to set aside and vacate
judgment shall expire 75 days from the mailing of notice of entry of judgment
by the clerk of the court pursuant to Section 664.5, or 75 days after service
upon the moving party by any party of written notice of entry of the judgment,
whichever is earlier, or if that notice has not been given, 75 days after the
filing of the first notice of intention to move to set aside and vacate the
judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., § 663a, subd. (b).) Plaintiff was served with the
Notice of Entry of Judgment and Order on August 4, 2023. Even as of the date of
the initial hearing on the Motion, set for November 2, 2023, more than 75 days
had elapsed since Plaintiff was served with the Notice of Entry of Judgment and
Order. Therefore, the Court has no authority to grant the Motion.
Plaintiff’s
second Motion to Vacate is also brought under Code of Civil Procedure sections
663, 473, subdivision (b), and 473.5. The second Motion, however, provides no
legal authority regarding the provisions of sections 473 and 473.5, or analysis
of how those statutes apply to the facts of this case. Finally, the third
Motion to Vacate cites no legal authority as a basis to vacate the judgment. 
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, Plaintiff
Young Chow Dai’s Motions to Vacate Judgment are DENIED.
