And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Douglas M. Keough's motion to vacate the entry of default and default judgment. The motion was made under Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5, which allows a party to set aside a default or default judgment if they did not receive actual notice of the action. Defendant Douglas claimed that he did not receive notice of the Summons and Complaint and that he only became aware of the action in November 2023. However, the judge found that Defendant Douglas did receive notice of the action, as evidenced by the numerous documents mailed to his residence after the action was filed. The judge also found that Defendant Douglas did not provide a sufficient explanation for why he did not notice these documents, and that merely claiming that he did not try to avoid service was not sufficient to meet the statutory requirements. As a result, the judge denied the motion and upheld the default judgment against Defendant Douglas.
