And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's Motion to Vacate Judgment, which was filed on August 7, 2023, and also denied the two subsequent motions to vacate judgment filed on August 11 and September 29, 2023. The judge found that the motions were procedurally improper and failed to present any cohesive and comprehensible argument in support of the motions. Additionally, the judge found that the motions were not timely under the statute, as more than 75 days had elapsed since the plaintiff was served with the Notice of Entry of Judgment and Order. The judge also noted that the plaintiff's motions did not provide any legal authority regarding the provisions of sections 473 and 473.5 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, or analysis of how those statutes apply to the facts of the case.
