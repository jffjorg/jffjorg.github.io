ANALYSIS: 
 
On April 17, 2023, Plaintiff Abba Bail Bonds, Inc. (“Plaintiff”)
filed this action against Defendant Dairyon Dayvon Thompson West (“Defendant”).
Defendant filed an answer, in propria persona, on September 6, 2023. Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Compel Deposition and
Request for Sanctions on December 19, 2023. No opposition has been filed to
date. 
 
Discussion

 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, section (a) states
in relevant part: 
 
If, after service of a deposition
notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or
employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that is a party
under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section
2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce
for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move
for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the
production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).) The motion must
also “set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the production for
inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice” and “be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,
subds. (b)(1), (2).) 
 
Plaintiff served Defendant with a Notice of Deposition on September
29, 2023, setting the deposition for November 9, 2023. (Motion, Iskander Decl.,
Exh. 1.) Defendant did not attend the deposition or otherwise communicate with
Plaintiff’s counsel. (Id. at ¶3.) Attempts to reach Defendant regarding
the deposition and other outstanding discovery on December 17, 18, and 19, 2023
have been unsuccessful. (Id. at ¶5.) Based on this history and the lack
of any opposition, Plaintiff has demonstrated that the meet and confer
requirement is satisfied and that there was no good cause for Defendant’s failure
to attend the deposition or communicate regarding discovery. 
 
Due to Defendant’s failure to cooperate in the taking of
their deposition, Plaintiff is entitled to an order compelling their
appearance. An award of sanctions is also appropriate due to Defendant’s non-cooperation.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).) Plaintiff request for monetary
sanctions, however, is excessive given this straightforward and unopposed
motion. Under a lodestar calculation, sanctions are granted in the amount of $1,081.00
based on two hours of attorney time billed at $510.00 per hour and $61.00 in
costs. (Motion, Iskander Decl., ¶7.)
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Abba Bail Bonds, Inc.’s Motion to Compel
Appearance at Deposition and Request for Sanctions is GRANTED. DEFENDANT DAIRYON DAYVON THOMPSON WEST IS ORDERED TO
APPEAR FOR DEPOSITION AT A DATE AND TIME DETERMINED BY PLAINTIFFS’ COUNSEL,
WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER. DEFENDANT IS ALSO ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $1,081.00
TO PLAINTIFFS’ COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
