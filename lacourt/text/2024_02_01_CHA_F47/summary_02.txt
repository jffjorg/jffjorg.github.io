And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses a demurrer to the 4th, 5th, and 6th causes of action and a motion to strike certain portions of the complaint filed by the defendants, Prezzee, Inc. and Peter Durham, against the plaintiff, Sanah "Sonya" Hamad. The defendants had argued that certain portions of the complaint should be struck because they failed to state a valid claim. However, the plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint just nine court days before the hearing, which renders the demurrer and motion to strike moot. As a result, the judge has placed the demurrer and motion to strike off calendar, effectively dismissing them.
