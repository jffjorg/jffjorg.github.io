And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendants in a legal malpractice action brought by the plaintiff. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants, a law firm, failed to properly represent him in a probate action, causing him emotional distress. The defendants demurred to the plaintiff's claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED), arguing that the allegations are insufficient. The court has sustained the demurrer, finding that the plaintiff's allegations do not adequately plead intentional conduct or conduct that rises to the level of malice or conscious disregard. The court has also denied the plaintiff's request for leave to amend the complaint. The defendants are ordered to serve and file their Answer within 10 days.
