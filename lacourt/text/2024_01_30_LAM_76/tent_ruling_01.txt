ANALYSIS
Motion For Final Approval
of Class Action and Representative Action Settlement
“The trial court must determine
whether a class action settlement is fair and reasonable, and has broad
discretion to do so.” (Clark v. American
Residential Services LLC (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 785, 791.)
Here, in conditionally certifying
the settlement class, the Court implicitly found that the settlement appeared
to be within in the range of reasonableness of settlements and the product of
arms-length, informed negotiations, subject to any objections that may be
raised at the final hearing.
No objections have been raised in
advance of this final hearing, and there have been no opt-outs. The Court
hereby affirms the findings in the Order Granting Preliminary Approval of Class
Action Settlement.
 As set forth in the moving papers,
the $120,229.89 gross settlement amount will yield a net payment to the 575
class members of $75.37.
The Settlement Agreement provides
for a PAGA payment of $10,000, with $7,500 (75%) to be paid to the LWDA, and
the remaining $2,500 (25%) to be included as part of the Net Settlement Amount
for payment to Settlement Class Members.) This allocation complies with Labor
Code § 2699(i).
The Settlement Administrator administered
the class notice. As noted, there were zero objections and zero objections. (Declaration
of Yami Burns.)
The Court finds the settlement to
be fair, adequate and reasonable.
As to whether an attorney fee is
fair, the primary factor for determination is whether the fee bears a
reasonable relationship to the value of the attorney’s work. (Robbins v. Alibrandi (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th
438, 451.)  In fee-shifting cases, the
primary method is the lodestar method; and in common fund cases, the primary
method is the percentage of the fee method. (Apple Computer, Inc. v. Superior Court (Cagney) (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th
1253, 1270; Thayer v. Wells Fargo Bank,
N.A. (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 819, 833.)  Courts have adopted a practice of cross-checking
the lodestar against the value of the class recovery because the award is then
anchored in the time spent by counsel. (Lealao
v. Beneficial California, Inc. (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 19, 45, fn.
12.)
Here, class counsel is requesting
attorney fees in the amount of 40,075.63, which represents 1/3% of the gross settlement
value. This is lower than the calculated lodestar, which would be $161,103.00.
(Bibiyan Decl., ¶ 15.) The request for attorney’s fees in the amount of $40,076.63
is approved. The request for costs in the amount of $9,813.84 as set forth in
the Bibiyan Decl. at ¶ 18 is approved.
Plaintiffs request a $7,500
incentive award to Plaintiff and Class representative Soheil Davood. He
submitted a declaration which justifies the award requested.
 “[T]he rationale for making enhancement or
incentive awards to named plaintiffs is that they should be compensated for the
expense or risk they have incurred in conferring a benefit on other members of
the class.” (Clark, supra, 175 Cal.App.4th at p. 806.) An incentive award is
appropriate “ ‘if it is necessary to induce an individual to participate in the
suit[.]’ … [Citation.]” (Id. at p. 804.) “[C]riteria courts may consider in
determining whether to make an incentive award include: 1) the risk to the class
representative in commencing suit, both financial and otherwise; 2) the
notoriety and personal difficulties encountered by the class representative; 3)
the amount of time and effort spent by the class representative; 4) the
duration of the litigation and; 5) the personal benefit (or lack thereof)
 [*1395]  enjoyed by the class representative as a result of the
litigation. [Citations.]” (Van Vranken v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (N.D.Cal.
1995) 901 F.Supp. 294, 299.) These “incentive awards” to class representatives
must not be disproportionate to the amount of time and energy expended in
pursuit of the lawsuit. (See Dornberger v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. (S.D.N.Y.
2001) 203 F.R.D. 118, 124–125.)


(Cellphone Termination Fee Cases (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 1380,
1394-95.)
The Court will approve the request of a $7,500 incentive award to Plaintiff.
Administration costs in the amount of
$9,500.00 are approved. (Burns Decl., ¶ 17; Exh. B.)
In light of the foregoing, the
motion for final approval of the class action settlement is GRANTED.
Per CRC Rule 3.769, the Court is
required to retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the terms of the
judgment and may not enter an order dismissing the action. 
      CRC
Rule 3.769(h) provides: 
If the
court approves the settlement agreement after the final approval hearing, the
court must make and enter judgment. The judgment must include a provision for the retention of the court's
jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the terms of the judgment. The court
may not enter an order
dismissing the action at the same time as, or after, entry of judgment.
     (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.769(h)[bold emphasis and underlining added].)
            The Court sets a status
conference September 23, 2024 at 8:30 AM regarding completion of the administration
of the settlement. Once the period in which to cash settlement payment checks
distributed to class members has expired, the administrator shall submit a
report to the Court regarding the results of settlement distribution. If the
Court finds that the terms of the settlement as set forth in the judgment have
been satisfied, the Court will dismiss the action at that time.
