Discussion          
Defendant
Ethos Society Ktown Holdings, LLC moves to compel arbitration and stay this
action.
The Court
first addresses whether Defendant waived the right to compel arbitration. Plaintiff
filed the Complaint in this action on April 14, 2023, and the case was classified
as limited civil. On April 26, 2023, Defendant filed a demurrer. On May 18,
2023, the Court ordered the case related to 23STCV06711, and ordered the case
reclassified as a civil unlimited jurisdiction case. On July 26, 2023, the Court
issued a ruling on Defendant’s demurrer and motion to strike. On August 9,
2023, Defendant filed the instant motion to compel arbitration. Thereafter, on
August 25, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint.
The Court
finds that Defendant did not waive the right to arbitration by virtue of having
filed a demurrer while the case was in limited civil. Under the procedural circumstances
in this action, especially with the reclassification, the delay in filing the
motion to compel was reasonable, and there is no indication that Plaintiff
suffered prejudice in the form of a substantial expenditure of time and money
on this litigation, or that Defendant gain an unfair advantage from the delay. (Bower v. Inter-Con Security Systems, Inc.
(2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 1035, 1048.) 
In all
other respects, the Court incorporates by reference its discussion in
23STCV06711. For the reasons discussed therein, the motion to compel
arbitration is GRANTED and the litigation is ordered stayed pending
arbitration. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.4.)
The Court
sets a status conference for April 30, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. regarding the
commencement of arbitration. The parties are expected to commence arbitration
by that date.
