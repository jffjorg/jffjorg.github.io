ALLEGATIONS: 
 
ARF Financial, LLC
(Plaintiff) brought this action against 311 W. Chicago Ave, LLC. dba Hush
Chicago, Paul D. Alqas, Chase C. Meyer, & George A. Rizzo (collectively
Defendants). Plaintiff alleged, among other things, that Defendants defaulted
on a merchant credit loan issued by Plaintiff in the amount of $75,000. 
 
On May 4, 2024, Plaintiff
filed a notice of settlement. The Court read and considered the notice of
settlement and thereafter set an OSC re: Dismissal for January 6, 2025. Jurisidction
was retained pursuant to C.C.P. § 664.6.
 
On July 24, 2024,
Plaintiff filed this Motion to Vacate the Notice of Settlement and Enter
Judgment. Plaintiff asks that judgment be entered against Defendants pursuant
to the terms of the agreement. 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
I.                   
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
C.C.P. §
664.6(a) provides: 
 
If
parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties
outside of the presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement
of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment
pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court
may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until
performance in full of the terms of the settlement.
 
II.                
MERITS 
 
Plaintiff
has sufficiently demonstrated that the parties stipulated to the entry of
judgment against Defendants in this matter in the event Defendants ceased
making settlement payments. Plaintiff submits the declaration of its counsel,
Angela Velen, to which a copy of the fully executed settlement agreement is
attached. (See Velen Decl. Exh. 1.) The agreement contains a clear provision
that, in the event of default, Plaintiff could seek the entry of judgment in
this matter totaling the unpaid balance ($85,153.88) minus any pre-default
payments. (Id. at ¶ 6.) 
 
Plaintiff’s
declaration states that Defendants made $52,400.00 in settlement payments but
thereafter stopped making payments. (Velen Decl. ¶ 5.) Despite notice to
Defendants of their default, Defendants remain in arrears. (Velen Decl.
¶ 6, Exh. 2.) Plaintiff states that the remaining balance for the
stipulated settlement is $38,881.31. (Velen Decl. ¶ 9.) 
 
Pursuant
to the stipulation, judgment is to be entered in favor of Amex in the amount of
$38,881.31. The court will sign Plaintiff’s proposed Order and enter the
proposed Judgment.
