And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by Judah Friedman to enter a consent judgment in a case that was previously settled between Friedman and Miriel Thompson. Friedman is seeking to vacate a permanent restraining order against Thompson, but the judge is unclear about the purpose of the motion and whether it is necessary to enter a consent judgment to achieve this goal. The judge notes that the parties stipulated to the terms of the settlement, which was memorialized in a minute order, and that the court retained jurisdiction to enforce the settlement. However, Friedman does not allege that Thompson has violated any terms of the settlement, and the judge is uncertain about the grounds for the motion. Therefore, the judge is denying the motion to enter a consent judgment without prejudice.
