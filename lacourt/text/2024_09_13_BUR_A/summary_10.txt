And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling is in response to a motion by the First Amendment Coalition to unseal the record and compel Plaintiffs to disclose their true names. The Plaintiffs, John Doe and Jane Roe, are proceeding anonymously and have filed their Complaint under pseudonyms. The Court finds that the motion to unseal the record is premature and denies the motion without prejudice. The Court notes that Plaintiffs have not adhered to the proper procedure for proceeding anonymously and must move for permission to do so in accordance with California Rules of Court, Rule 2.551(b). The Court sets an OSC re: Proceeding Anonymously for November 15, 2024 at 10:30 a.m. and requires Plaintiffs to file a motion for permission to proceed anonymously within 60 days.
