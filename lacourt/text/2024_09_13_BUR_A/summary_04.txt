Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering two motions to compel further responses to discovery demands from Plaintiff Jonathan Lee against Defendants Zane and Gina Cazares. The Plaintiff alleges that he was injured by the Defendants' negligent operation of a motor vehicle.

The judge finds that the Plaintiff has demonstrated good cause for further production and that the Defendants' responses were incomplete and failed to identify facts, witnesses, or documents. The judge grants the motions to compel further responses and orders that the Defendants provide supplemental responses within 30 days.

The judge also awards sanctions in the amount of $1,710 against the Defendants' counsel for opposing the motion and for failing to substantiate their objections. The judge finds that the Defendants' counsel acted without substantial justification and that the imposition of sanctions is necessary to deter similar behavior in the future.
