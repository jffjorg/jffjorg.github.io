And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend their complaint. The motion was procedurally defective, as the plaintiffs failed to include a list of proposed changes or a copy of the proposed amended pleading. The judge also found that the plaintiffs' explanation for the amendments was insufficient and that they failed to explain why they did not move to amend earlier. Additionally, the judge found that the motion to amend was an improper vehicle to address the plaintiffs' concerns about personal jurisdiction. The court's ruling on personal jurisdiction was based on the evidentiary showings made by both parties in connection with the motion to quash, and the plaintiffs did not provide sufficient evidence to convince the court that personal jurisdiction exists. The judge also admonished the plaintiffs' counsel to provide timely notice of future court dates when ordered to do so.
