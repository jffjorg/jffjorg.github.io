**English Summary:**

This tentative ruling pertains to a case where Plaintiff Ashlie Anderson sued Defendant Ricardo Avelar and his insurer, Automobile Club of Southern California, for damages arising from a car accident. Anderson claims Avelar was at fault and the insurer acted fraudulently and discriminatorily by unfairly designating her vehicle as a "total loss."

The Defendants moved to strike several causes of action in Anderson's complaint, which the court granted. Now, the Defendants are seeking attorney fees for successfully defending against Anderson's claims. 

Anderson opposes the fee request, citing various issues with the Defendants' arguments and the court process. She also requests additional time to prepare for the hearing due to a recent hospitalization. 

The judge has continued the hearing to December 12, 2023, and ordered Anderson to provide medical documentation supporting her need for a continuance.
