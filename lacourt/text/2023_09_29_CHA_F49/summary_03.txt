Summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion by the defendants (Automobile Club of Southern California, et al.) for attorney fees in the amount of $15,267.43 following their successful special motion to strike the second through twelfth causes of action from the complaint filed by plaintiff Ashlie Anderson. The plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that it is untimely, seeks fees before entry of judgment, and is unreasonable. The Judge continues the hearing to December 12, 2023, and orders the plaintiff to produce a current and updated medically supported supplemental declaration explaining any inability to appear. The Judge also reserves the right to proceed with the hearing if the plaintiff does not provide a timely declaration.
