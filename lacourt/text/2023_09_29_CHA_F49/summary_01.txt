Here is a summary of the ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled that the William S. Hart Union High School District owed a duty of care to the plaintiffs, Blackwell and Muehlberger, in connection with the shooting death of their children at Saugus High School. The court found that the school district had knowledge of potential violence and had implemented some safety measures, but failed to do enough to prevent the shooting. The court also found that the shooting was foreseeable and that the school district had a duty to investigate the student's behavior and provide appropriate support and services to address his needs. The court denied the school district's motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication, and instead found that triable issues of material fact exist as to whether the school district's failure to take reasonable steps to prevent the shooting was a breach of its duty of care.

The court's ruling is based on its analysis of the evidence presented, including the depositions of school officials and experts, as well as the "murder book" report and other documents. The court found that the school district had a duty to protect the students from foreseeable harm, including harm caused by a student with a known history of violence. The court also found that the school district's failure to take reasonable steps to prevent the shooting was a breach of its duty of care.

The court's ruling is subject to change based on the further developments in the case.
