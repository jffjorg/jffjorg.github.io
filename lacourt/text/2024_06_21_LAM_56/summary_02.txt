And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to compel responses to special interrogatories, form interrogatories, requests for admission, and requests for production of documents. The motions were filed by plaintiff Edwin Enrique Hercules Jr against defendant FCA US LLC, et al.

The judge has granted the motions to compel responses to the extent that any objections contained in the defendant's responses are waived. The defendant failed to respond to the interrogatories and requests for admission in a timely manner, and the plaintiff moves to compel the defendant to respond.

The judge has also imposed no sanctions on the defendant, as no request for sanctions was made in the motion. The judge notes that the defendant's responses contain objections, which are deemed waived due to the responses being served late.

The parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court as directed by the instructions provided on the court website. If the department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
