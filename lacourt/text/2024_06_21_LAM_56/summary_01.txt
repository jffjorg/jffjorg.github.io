And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the motion of the defendants, Dvir Cohen and Yafit Cohen, to enforce the parties' settlement agreement and dissolve the preliminary injunction issued on November 8, 2022. The settlement agreement, signed on January 26, 2024, requires the plaintiff, Bo Zhang, to apply to dissolve the preliminary injunction. The court finds that the parties entered into a valid and binding settlement and that the defendants have demonstrated the need to modify the injunction to enforce the settlement agreement. The court notes that the settlement agreement was signed by all parties and their respective counsel, and that there is no evidence to conclude otherwise. The court grants the motion under California Code of Civil Procedure sections 664.6 and 533. The motions to compel depositions and for sanctions are moot as a result.
