1005, subdivision (b), any opposition papers were required to have been filed

BACKGROUND       

            This action arose out of a dispute
over the August 22, 2022 foreclosure sale of a real property located at 611 West
Lemon Avenue, Arcadia, CA 91007 (the “Property”).  On October 7, 2002, Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant
Bo Zhang (“Zhang”) brought the complaint against Defendants asserting claims
for (1) fraudulent misrepresentation and (2) violation of Business and
Professions Code section 17200.  Zhang
alleges that he is entitled to purchase the Property as an “eligible tenant buyer”
under Civil Code section 2924m.  
 
On
November 8, 2022, upon application of Zhang, the Court issued a preliminary
injunction (“PI”) enjoining Defendants from evicting Zhang from the Property
and from transferring title to the Property.
 
            On January 25 and January 26, 2024,
all parties named in this action signed
a Settlement
Agreement and Mutual Release (“Settlement Agreement”).  (Declaration of Atty. Andrew Jay Kulick
(“Kulick Decl.”), Exhibit (“Exh.”) A.)
 
            On March 25, 2024, Moving Defendants
filed this motion pursuant to CCP sections 664.6 and 533, in order to enforce
the parties’ Settlement Agreement, specifically the provision requiring Zhang to
move to dissolve the November 8, 2022 PI.
 


 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE 
            Moving
Defendants request judicial notice of the PI issued by the Court.  The Court notes that judicial notice of its
own records related to this case is unnecessary and redundant.  Nonetheless, Moving Defendants’ request is
granted.
 
DISCUSSION
Legal Standard
According
to CCP section 664.6(a), “[i]f parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a
writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.  If requested by the parties, the court may
retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until
performance in full of the terms of the settlement.” “[T]he court's retention
of general jurisdiction under section 664.6 includes the court’s equitable
authority.” (Lofton v. Wells Fargo Home Mortgage (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th
1050, 1061.)  “Nothing in the language of
section 664.6 suggests it was intended to be exclusive.”  (Kilpatrick v. Beebe (1990) 219 Cal.
App. 3d 1527, 1529.)  This provision “was
enacted to provide a summary procedure for specifically enforcing a settlement
contract without the need for a new lawsuit.” (Weddington Productions, Inc.
v. Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793, 809.)  The court ruling on the motion may consider
the parties’ declarations and other evidence in deciding what terms the parties
agreed. (In re Marriage of Assemi (1994) 7 Cal.4th 896, 911.)
 
CCP
section 533 states that “[i]n any action, the court may on notice modify or
dissolve an injunction or temporary restraining order upon a showing that there
has been a material change in the facts upon which the injunction or temporary
restraining order was granted, that the law upon which the injunction or
temporary restraining order was granted has changed, or that the ends of
justice would be served by the modification or dissolution of the injunction or
temporary restraining order.”
 
Analysis
The
parties entered into a written Settlement Agreement on January 26, 2024, after
the issuance of the PI on November 8, 2022. 
Among the agreed-upon terms required Zhang to “apply to dissolve the
preliminary injunction to permit the sale” of the Property.  The Settlement Agreement states in relevant
part, as follows:

 
(Kulick Decl.,
Exh. A.)  The agreement was signed by all
parties in this action as well as their respective counsel.  (Id.)  The Court finds that the parties entered into
a valid and binding settlement, and there is no evidence for the Court to
conclude otherwise.  
 
Therefore,
Moving Defendants have demonstrated the need to modify the injunction in order
to enforce the parties’ agreement.  Thus,
the Court finds there has been a material change in facts and the ends of
justice would be served by modifying the injunction order. (Code Civ. Proc. §
533.)  
 
Ruling
Accordingly,
Moving Defendants’ motion is GRANTED under CCP §§ 664.6 and 533.  As a consequence, the Motions to Compel
Depositions and for Sanctions are MOOT.
 
Moving
Defendants are to submit a proposed order.
 
Moving
Defendants are ordered to give notice of this ruling.             
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
