Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion for trial preference. The plaintiff, Baydzar Keosheyan, is 85 years old and has ongoing health issues due to an injury sustained at the defendant's market, Kirakosyan Market Inc. The plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendant and a motion for trial preference, citing the need for a speedy trial due to her age and health issues. The defendant did not file an opposition to the motion. The parties agreed to a joint stipulation, which sets a trial date within 120 days from the signing of an order. The judge finds that the plaintiff has met the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure § 36(a)(1)-(2) and that granting the motion for trial preference will serve the interests of justice. Therefore, the judge tentatively plans to grant the plaintiff's motion for trial preference.
