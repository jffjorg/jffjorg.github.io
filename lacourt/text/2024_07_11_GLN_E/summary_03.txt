```yaml
Case:
  Number: 23GDCV02489
  Name: Vartouhie Achakian v. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC, et al.

Parties:
  Plaintiff: Vartouhie Achakian
  Defendant: Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC, Calstar Motors Inc.

Facts:
  * Plaintiff filed a complaint on November 22, 2023, alleging three causes of action.
  * The first two causes of action are against Defendant Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC, alleging violation of the Song-Beverly Act - Breach of Express Warranty and violation of the Song-Beverly Act - Breach of Implied Warranty.
  * The third cause of action is against Defendant Calstar Motors Inc. alleging negligent repair.
  * Plaintiff's counsel served the discovery requests on January 3, 2024, which were due on February 2, 2024.
  * As of May 29, 2024, Defendant's counsel had not responded to the discovery requests.

Disputes:
  * Defendant argues that the discovery requests were not properly served and therefore, no responses were required.
  * Plaintiff argues that the discovery requests were properly served and that Defendant had a duty to respond.

Legal Standard:
  * CCP ยง 2033.280(b) states that if a party to whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely response, the requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted.

Intentions:
  * Plaintiff intends to move for an order deeming the truth of the matters admitted in the discovery requests.
  * Defendant intends to argue that the discovery requests were not properly served and therefore, no responses were required.

Money:
  * Plaintiff seeks monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,904.00 for Defendant's misuse and abuse of the discovery act.

Roles:
  * Judge: [Name of Judge]
  * Plaintiff's Counsel: [Name of Counsel]
  * Defendant's Counsel: [Name of Counsel]

Significant Statements:
  * "The Court does not find Defendant's excuse persuasive or compelling. It is up to Defendant's counsel to effectively operate its own law firm so that it can diligently represent its client." (Paragraph 16)
  * "The Court fails to understand Plaintiff's argument. CRC, rule 2.251(c)(1) states, 'A court may require parties to serve documents electronically in specified civil actions by local rule or court order, as provided in Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6 and the rules in this chapter.'" (Paragraph 24)
  * "The Court does not find Plaintiff's citation availing. Although Plaintiff argues that the statutory scheme's only reference to prior consent to e-service is embodied in ยง 1010.6(c)(1)-(2), that does not appear to be the case. CCP ยง 1010.6(c) 'applies to electronic service by consent of an unrepresented person in a civil action.'" (Paragraph 30)
```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the parties' arguments and finds that the discovery requests were not properly served. Therefore, the Court denies Plaintiff's motion to compel responses to the discovery requests. The Court also finds that Defendant's failure to respond to the discovery requests was not a result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. As such, the Court will not deem the truth of the matters admitted in the discovery requests.

The Court notes that Defendant's counsel failed to properly serve the discovery requests and that Plaintiff's counsel was aware of this failure. The Court also notes that Defendant's counsel did not provide any legal authority to support its argument that the discovery requests were not properly served.

The Court will hear argument on what Defendant is attempting to assert with respect to CCP ยง 1010.6(a)(1) and CRC, rule 2.251(b)(1)(B). The Court will also consider the parties' arguments on the proper service address for the parties.

The Court denies Plaintiff's motion to compel responses to the discovery requests and orders Defendant to serve the discovery requests on the correct email address. The Court also awards Plaintiff monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,904.00 for Defendant's misuse and abuse of the discovery act.
