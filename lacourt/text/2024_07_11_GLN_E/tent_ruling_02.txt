TENTATIVE RULINGS – COMPEL RESPONSES
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff, Evon Halaka, filed a Complaint on 11/09/2023 alleging three
causes of action for: (1) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express
Warranty, (2) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Implied Warranty, and
(3) Violation of Song-Beverly Act Section 1793.2.
 
MOTION 1 - RELIEF REQUESTED¿ 
“Plaintiffs, EVON HALAKA (hereinafter “Plaintiffs”), will, and hereby do, move
for an order to compel responses, without objections, to Plaintiff’s Form and
Special Interrogatories, Set One (“Interrogatories”). Plaintiff’s
Interrogatories were initially served and propounded on Defendant by Plaintiff
on December 29, 2023. 
 
This Motion is made pursuant to
California Code of Civil Procedure, sections 2033.280, subdivision (a), and
2033.280, subdivision (b), on the grounds that Defendant FCA US LLC
(“Defendant”) has failed to provide any responses to Plaintiff’s Interrogatories,
which seek information directly relevant to their claims under the Song-Beverly
Consumer Warranty Act. Thus, Plaintiff seeks an order compelling Defendant to
produce responses, without objections, within 10 calendar days of the Court’s
order. 
 
The Motion is based upon this
Notice, the following Memorandum of Points and Authorities, the Declaration of
Gregory Sogoyan, the pleadings, and papers on file herein, and upon any other
matters that may be presented to the Court at the hearing. 
 
No separate statement is being
submitted in support of the instant Motion, as it is not required pursuant to
rule 3.1345(b) of the California Rules of Court.”

LEGAL
STANDARD – COMPEL RESPONSES, INTERROGATORIES
Within 30 days after service of interrogatories, the party to whom the
interrogatories are propounded shall serve the original of the response to them
on the propounding party, unless on motion of the propounding party the court
has shortened the time for response, or unless on motion of the responding
party the court has extended the time for response. (CCP § 2030.260(a).)
If
a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response,
the party propounding the interrogatories may move for an order compelling
response to the interrogatories. (CCP § 2030.290(b).)
Further,
if a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely
response, “The party to whom the interrogatories are directed waives any right
to exercise the option to produce writings under Section 2030.230, as well as
any objection to the interrogatories, including one based on privilege or on
the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its
determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The
party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with
Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240. (2) The party’s failure to
serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect.” (CCP § 2030.290(a).)
Unlike
a motion to compel further responses, a motion to compel responses is not
subject to a 45-day time limit, and the propounding party does not have to
demonstrate either good cause or that it satisfied a “meet and confer”
requirement. (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404 citing Weil and
Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group

to hH-30 (Weil & Brown).)

LEGAL
STANDARD – COMPEL RESPONSES, INSPECTION DEMANDS
Within
30 days after service of a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling, the party to whom the demand is directed shall serve the original of
the response to it on the party making the demand, and a copy of the response
on all other parties who have appeared in the action, unless on motion of the
party making the demand, the court has shortened the time for response, or
unless on motion of the party to whom the demand has been directed, the court
has extended the time for response. (CCP § 2031.260(a).)
If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
party making the demand may move for an order compelling response to the
demand. (CCP § 2031.300(b).)
If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
party to whom the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
directed waives any objection to the demand, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). (CCP § 2031.300(a).) “The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following conditions
are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently served a response that is in
substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240,
and 2031.280. (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result
of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (CCP § 2031.300(a)(1)-(2).)
Unlike a motion to compel further responses, a motion
to compel responses is not subject to a 45-day time limit, and the propounding
party does not have to demonstrate either good cause or that it satisfied a
“meet and confer” requirement. (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.

8:1489, pp. 8H-29 to hH-30 (Weil & Brown).)
LEGAL STANDARD –REQUEST TO DEEM ADMISSIONS ADMITTED
“Within 30 days after service of requests for
admission, the party to whom the requests are directed shall serve the original
of the response to them on the requesting party, and a copy of the response on
all other parties who have appeared, unless on motion of the requesting party
the court has shortened the time for response, or unless on motion of the
responding party the court has extended the time for response.” (CCP § 2033.250(a).)
 
If a party to whom
requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely response, the
requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents
and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as
well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with § 2023.010).
(CCP § 2033.280(b).) 
Further, “If
a party to whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely
response, the following rules apply: (a) The party to whom the requests for
admission are directed waives any objection to the requests, including one
based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently served a response
that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and
2033.230. (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response was the
result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (CCP § 2033.280(a).)
“The court shall
make this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.” (CCP § 2033.280(c).)
 
TENTATIVE RULING ALL MOTIONS 
Plaintiff lumps what
should have been four motions into three motions.
A motion must be brought separately as to each
discovery method at issue. The instant three motions should have been filed as four
separate motions and four filing fees paid. Plaintiff’s Motion 1 lumped
compelling responses to Form and Special Interrogatories, Set One, into one
motion when it should have been filed as two separate motions, i.e., one motion
for FROGs and one motion for SROGs. “[P]ayment of filing fees is both mandatory
and jurisdictional.” (Hu vs. Silgan Containers Corp. (1999) 70 Cal. App.
4th 1261, 1269.)  
If
Plaintiff wants these four motions to be heard, they can pay the additional
filing fee to the Court before the hearing and show proof of payment of the
additional filing fee before the hearing.
Alternatively,
Plaintiff is welcome to request the Court to continue the instant hearings to a
date that all four motions will be scheduled for; however, Plaintiff is advised
that all motions must provide sufficient notice to Defendant. Further, Plaintiff
would need to clarify which discovery method Motion 1 will pertain to on the
future hearing date, i.e., will Motion 1 pertain to special interrogatories or
form interrogatories. Presumably, the additional motion filed will clearly
indicate what individual discovery method it pertains to, i.e. FROGs or SROGs.
As
to the merits of these motions, on December 29, 2023, Plaintiff served Form
Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, Requests for Production of Documents,
and Requests for Admissions, Set One, on Defendant. (Sogoyan Decl. ¶ 8.)
As
of the date of the Sogoyan Declarations [April 29, 2024], Defendant had failed
to provide any responses to the discovery served on December 29, 2023.
Therefore, Defendant did not provide timely responses, as the responses did not
come anywhere close to being served within 30 days of service of the discovery
that was propounded.
On
June 12, 2024, which would be after the filing of Plaintiff’s motions, Defendant
served unverified responses. On June 20, 2024 Defendant served verifications to
the responses. Therefore, here, responses were not timely provided, but
responses and verifications were ultimately provided before the hearing on the
instant motions.
Tentative
Ruling Motions 1 and 2
As
to the Oppositions to the SROGs/FROGs and RFPs, Defendant argues that it did
not waive objections because it served responses that were substantially
compliant and its failure to timely respond was due to mistake, inadvertence,
or excusable neglect. 
Those
arguments as to SROGs/FROGS and RFPs are unavailing. Whether Defendant served
substantially compliant responses, or whether the untimely response were due to
mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, is irrelevant for compelling
initial responses to interrogatories and RFPs at this hearing. That standard is
only relevant if Defendant files a motion to be relieved from waiver of
objections. Defendant has not filed a motion to be relieved from waiver of
objections, and the Oppositions are not considered motions to be relieved from
waiver of objections. 
Further,
as to SROGs/FROGs and RFPs, Opposition argues that Motions 1 and 2 should be
denied as moot.
The
Reply argues that Motions 1 and 2 should not be denied as moot. 
The
Reply supports its argument that Motions 1 and 2 should not be denied as moot
by citing to Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants because that case addressed the issue of if the trial court has
authority to hear a motion to compel responses to written interrogatories under
§ 2030.290 when the party on whom the interrogatories were served fails to
serve any response within the required time, thereby waiving objections, but
after the motion is served, provides an untimely response that the propounding
party deems inadequate. (Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 395-396 (Sinaiko).)
Ultimately,
the court in Sinaiko held that the scenario this Court faces today
(untimely responses that were served before the hearing) does not divest the
trial court authority to hear and grant a motion to compel responses under §
2030.290(b). (Sinaiko, supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 396.)
However,
Sinaiko also held that whether the trial court should proceed with a
motion to compel responses under § 2030.290 when there has been an untimely
response is within the sound discretion of the trial court. (Sinaiko, supra,
148 Cal.App.4th at p. 396.)
Therefore,
while the Reply is correct to note that this Court can rule on Motions 1 and 2
and does not have to deny them as moot, it is not entirely clear what the
moving party is seeking with its request to not have the motions be denied as moot.
It appears that the Reply has a problem that the responses to SROGs/FROGs and
RFPs asserted objections, and it appears that the Reply wants the Court to note
that objections to SROGs/FROGs and RFPs were waived, but it is not clear as to
what the Reply is arguing it seeks in the Court’s ruling on Motions 1 and 2.
Sinaiko
helps
shed light on potential ways in which the Court can deal with the instant
scenario as describe below:
Under section
2030.290, therefore, once a party has failed to serve timely interrogatory
responses, the trial court has the authority to hear a propounding party's
motion to compel responses under section 2030.290, subdivision (b),
regardless of whether a party serves an untimely response. If a party fails to
serve a timely response to interrogatories, then by operation of law, all
objections that it could assert to those interrogatories are waived. (§
2030.290, subd. (a).) Unless that party obtains relief from its waiver, the
propounding party is entitled to move under subdivision (b) for an order
compelling the response to which the propounding party is entitled—that is, a
response without objection, and that substantially complies with the provisions
governing the form (§ 2030.210) and completeness (§ 2030.220) of interrogatory
responses.
The
question we address is the extent of the trial court's authority under section
2030.290, subdivision (b), not whether relief should be granted in a particular
case. If a party provides an untimely interrogatory response that does not
contain objections and that sets forth legally valid responses to each interrogatory,
the untimely response might completely or substantially resolve the issues
raised by a motion to compel responses under section 2030.290. Even in
such cases, however, the trial court retains the authority to hear the motion.
(See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1030(a) [“The court may award
sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to
compel discovery, even though ... the requested discovery was provided to the
moving party after the motion was filed”].) Whether a particular response does
resolve satisfactorily the issues raised by a motion is a matter best
determined by the trial court in the exercise of its discretion, based on the
circumstances of the case. In many cases involving untimely responses, the
propounding party will take the motion off calendar or narrow its scope to the
issue of sanctions. If the propounding party proceeds with the motion, however,
the trial court has the discretion to rule on the motion. The trial court might
compel responses without objection if it finds no legally valid responses have
been provided to one or more interrogatories; it might deny the motion to
compel responses as essentially unnecessary, in whole or in part, and just impose
sanctions; it might treat the motion as one under section
2030.300 and either determine that further answers are required,14 or
order the propounding party to “meet and confer” (§ 2030.300, subd. (b)) and
file a separate statement (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1020(a)(2), (c)); or it
might take the motion off calendar, thereby requiring the propounding party to
file a motion under section 2030.300.
(Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 408-409.)
Therefore,
the Court will hear argument as to what Plaintiff precisely seeks with its
ruling with respect to Motions 1 and 2. The Court notes that it agrees that
objections were waived, and that Defendant has not filed a motion to be
relieved from waiver of objections. The Court also notes that while it is clear
that Plaintiff has a problem with the fact that Defendant asserted objections
in part of its responses, the Court will not be analyzing each response and
turning the instant hearings into motions to compel further responses. 
Tentative
Ruling Motion 3
As
to Motion 3, which pertains to RFAs, the same scenario as Motions 1 and 2
arises with respect to the fact that responses were untimely, and verified responses
were not provided until after the filing of the motion, but before the hearing
on the motion to deem admitted.
The
issues that Motion 3 face are slightly more complex than the issues that
Motions 1 and 2 face, and neither party helps the Court determine what the
proper solution is here. The primary issue that arises here is how the Court
should handle the objections in the responses to the RFAs at the instant
hearing.  
The
Opposition argues that the motion should be denied as moot in its entirety
because it served responses before the hearing, and Opposition argues that the
objections it asserted in its responses were not waived because its responses
were served in substantial compliance, and Defendant’s failure to timely
respond was due to mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
To
the extent that Opposition is under the impression that the Opposition is
considered a motion to be relieved from waiver of objections, the Court notes
that Defendant’s Opposition is not construed as a motion to be relieved from
waiver of objection.
The
Reply argues that this motion should not be denied as moot, the RFAs should be
deemed admitted, and objections should be waived. 
Reply
cites to Sinaiko to argue that this Court has authority to rule on this
motion, despite Defendant providing untimely responses.
However,
the Reply’s citation to Sinaiko is unhelpful to the Court. Sinaiko did not deal with RFAs, which are fundamentally different than
interrogatories and RFPs.
As stated in St. Mary v. Superior
Court:
RFAs are different from other civil discovery tools
such as depositions, interrogatories, and requests for documents. “Most of
the other discovery procedures are aimed primarily at assisting counsel to
prepare for trial. Requests for admissions, on the other hand, are primarily
aimed at setting at *775 rest a triable issue so that it will not
have to be tried. 
…
As has been explained in one treatise: “The
admission request differs fundamentally from the other five discovery tools
(depositions, interrogatories, inspection demands, medical examinations, and
expert witness exchanges). These devices principally seek to obtain proof
for use at trial. In marked contrast, admission requests seek to eliminate the
need for proof: ‘[T]he purpose of the admissions procedure ... is to limit the
triable issues and spare the parties the burden and expense of litigating
undisputed issues.’
(St.
Mary v. Superior Court (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 762, 774-774.) (St. Mary)
St.
Mary appears
to be more on point that Sinaiko, but St. Mary does not fully
direct this Court as to what it should do in the instant scenario.
In
St. Mary, St. Mary served her untimely proposed responses to the RFAs
not only before the hearing on the motion, but even before the motion to compel
responses was filed. (See St. Mary at 766 & 778.) [This Court notes
that here, the responses were served after the motion was filed, but for
purposes of analyzing St. Mary and the instant motion, the fact that the
untimely responses were served after the motion was filed seems to be a
distinction without a difference. St. Mary focuses on how the trial
court erred in deeming admitted responses when the responses were untimely.
Here, the responses were also untimely, and both St. Mary and 2033.280
don’t make a distinction between untimely responses served after the filing of the
motion versus untimely responses served before the filing of the motion. For
example, 2033.280(c) only makes a distinction with responses served before the hearing.]
St.
Mary helps
explain 2033.280 as follows:
Under
the RFA procedure postdating the Civil Discovery Act, a propounding party must
take affirmative steps—by bringing a formal “deemed admitted” motion—to have
RFAs to which timely responses are not received deemed admitted. In the
event responses to RFAs are not timely served, the responding party waives any
objections thereto (§ 2033.280, subd. (a)), and “[t]he requesting party may
move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any
matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary
sanction” (id. subd. (b)). Unless the court determines that
the responding party “has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed
response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with
Section 2033.220,” it must order the RFAs deemed admitted. (Id. subd.
(c).) “[A] deemed admitted order establishes, by judicial fiat, that a
nonresponding party has responded to the requests by admitting the truth of all
matters contained therein.” (Wilcox, supra, 21 Cal.4th at p. 979,
90 Cal.Rptr.2d 260, 987 P.2d 727.) The court must also impose monetary
sanctions upon the party and/or the attorney for the failure to serve a timely
response to the RFAs. (§ 2033.280, subd. (c).) But a responding party's
service, prior to the hearing on the “deemed admitted” motion, of substantially
compliant responses, will defeat a propounding party's attempt
under section 2033.280 to have the RFAs deemed admitted. (Tobin v.
Oris (1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 814, 827, 4 Cal.Rptr.2d 736 (Tobin ).)
As one court put it: “If the party manages to serve its responses before the
hearing, the court has no discretion but to deny the motion. But woe
betide the party who fails to serve responses before the hearing. In that
instance the court has no discretion but to grant the admission motion, usually
with fatal consequences for the defaulting party. One might call it ‘two
strikes and you're out’ as applied to civil procedure.” (Demyer v.
Costa Mesa Mobile Home Estates (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 393,
395–396, 42 Cal.Rptr.2d 260, fns. omitted (Demyer ).)18
(St. Mary v. Superior Court (2014) 223
Cal.App.4th 762, 775-776. Footnote 18 stated, “Both Tobin, supra, 3 Cal.App.4th 814,
4 Cal.Rptr.2d 736, and Demyer, supra, 36 Cal.App.4th 393,
42 Cal.Rptr.2d 260, were disapproved on other grounds in Wilcox, supra, 21
Cal.4th at p. 983, fn. 12, 90 Cal.Rptr.2d 260, 987 P.2d 727.)
However,
where there is a gap in St. Mary and in the instant scenario is how the
parties responded to the RFAs.
In
St. Mary, the Court of Appeal noted that the responses were in
substantial compliance and the RFAs should not have been deemed admitted even
though they were untimely and some of the responses contained more in their
responses than just the words “Admit” or “Deny.” (See St. Mary at p. 780-781.)
While
St. Mary addressed the key issue of whether a proposed response was
substantially compliant, the issue here is that none of the responses in St.
Mary had objections, whereas some of the responses here had objections. 
The
Reply argues that because the responses contained both responses and
objections, the Defendant’s responses are not in substantial compliance because
the objections were waived due to being untimely and that, therefore, the
responses should be deemed admitted. 
The
Court will hear argument because neither party provides case law as to whether
asserting both responses and objections in the untimely, verified responses, does
or does not constitute substantial compliance.
The
Court’s inclination is that Defendant’s responses were in substantial
compliance to the degree that the requests should not be deemed admitted. 
The
Court’s further inclination is that the objections in the responses would be
more appropriately dealt with in a different type of motion. For example, if
Defendant wanted to seek relief from waiver of objections, Defendant could
potentially file a motion for relief from waiver of objections under § 2033.280(a).

Likewise,
if Plaintiff doesn’t find the objections appropriate and that the objections
were waived, Plaintiff could potentially file a motion to compel further
responses.
As
stated in St. Mary:
If
the propounding party believes that the responses to RFAs are deficient in some
respect or that any objections thereto are not well taken, he or she may make a
motion to compel further responses under section 2033.290. (See Wimberly v.
Derby Cycle Corp. (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 618, 636, 65
Cal.Rptr.2d 532; Tobin, supra, 3 Cal.App.4th at p.
829, fn. 25, 4 Cal.Rptr.2d 736.) Section 2033.290 provides that such a motion
to compel further responses may be made within 45 days of service of the
responses (§ 2033.290, subd. **529 (c)) if the propounding
party asserts that the particular answer or answers are “evasive or incomplete”
or the objection or objections are “without merit or too general” (id. subd.
(a)). 
(St.
Mary, supra,  223 Cal.App.4th at 776.)
Further:
The
RFA device is not intended to provide a windfall to litigants. Nor is the RFA
procedure a “gotcha” device in which an overly aggressive propounding
party—who rejects facially reasonable requests for a short discovery extension
and thereafter files the wrong discovery motion after service of a slightly
tardy proposed RFA response that is substantially code-compliant—may obtain a
substantive victory in the case by having material issues deemed admitted. RFAs
are not to be deemed admitted unless the party to whom RFAs are propounded
fails to respond prehearing to RFAs in a manner that is substantially
code-compliant (§ 2033.280, subd. (c)), or he or she is recalcitrant and
violates a court order compelling further responses that are deficient (§
2033.290, subd. (e)). Furthermore, the order deeming admitted the 41 RFAs, to
the extent that it may substantially impact St. Mary's ability to prove her
case, undermines public policy that promotes controversies being resolved
through trials on the merits. (See New Albertson's, Inc., supra, 168
Cal.App.4th at pp. 1420–1421, 86 Cal.Rptr.3d 457 [court's discretion under
§ 2033.300 to grant party leave to withdraw or amend RFA responses based upon
“mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect” must be exercised consistently
with “the spirit of the law and in a manner that serves the interests of
justice”; policy favoring trial on the merits dictates that any doubts be
resolved in favor of party seeking relief].)
(St.
Mary v. Superior Court (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 783-784.)
The
Court will hear argument as to Motion 3. 

Sanctions – Requests for Admission
“It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or
attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for
admission necessitated this motion.” (CCP § 2033.280(c).) 
Sanctions - Inspection Demands
In relevant part, § 2031.300(c) states as follows:
Except as provided
in subdivision (d), the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully
makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.
 
(CCP §
2031.300(c).)
 
Sanctions – Interrogatories
CCP
§ 2030.290 states in relevant part:
The court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.
 
(CCP §
2030.290(c).)
 
Sanctions Ruling
“The
court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files
a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was
filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery
was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1348(a).) 
 
Here, none of the three notices/motions sought
sanctions in their moving papers. However, all three of Plaintiff’s replies argue
that the Court should impose sanctions against Defendant, or their counsel of
record, in an amount the Court deems fit. 
The Court notes that the section regarding sanctions
for RFAs (§ 2033.280(c)) uses different language in the sense that it says
sanctions are “mandatory.”
The Court will hear argument because the Court is
concerned about notice issues since Movant did not request sanctions until the
Reply. 
As stated in CRC, rule 2.30, titled, “Sanctions for
rules violations in civil cases”:
(a) Application
This sanctions rule applies to the rules
in the California Rules of Court relating to general civil cases, unlawful
detainer cases, probate proceedings, civil proceedings in the appellate
division of the superior court, and small claims cases.
(b) Sanctions
In addition to any other sanctions
permitted by law, the court may order a person, after written notice and an
opportunity to be heard, to pay reasonable monetary sanctions to the court or
an aggrieved person, or both, for failure without good cause to comply with the
applicable rules. For the purposes of this rule, "person" means a
party, a party's attorney, a witness, and an insurer or any other individual or
entity whose consent is necessary for the disposition of the case. If a failure
to comply with an applicable rule is the responsibility of counsel and not of
the party, any penalty must be imposed on counsel and must not adversely affect
the party's cause of action or defense thereto.
(c) Notice and procedure
Sanctions must not be imposed under this
rule except on noticed motion by the party seeking sanctions or on the court's
own motion after the court has provided notice and an opportunity to be heard.
A party's motion for sanctions must (1) state the applicable rule that has been
violated, (2) describe the specific conduct that is alleged to have violated
the rule, and (3) identify the attorney, law firm, party, witness, or other
person against whom sanctions are sought. The court on its own motion may issue
an order to show cause that must (1) state the applicable rule that has been
violated, (2) describe the specific conduct that appears to have violated the
rule, and (3) direct the attorney, law firm, party, witness, or other person to
show cause why sanctions should not be imposed against them for violation of
the rule.
(d) Award of expenses
In addition to the sanctions awardable
under (b), the court may order the person who has violated an applicable rule
to pay to the party aggrieved by the violation that party's reasonable
expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees and costs, incurred in
connection with the motion for sanctions or the order to show cause.
(e) Order
An order imposing sanctions must be in
writing and must recite in detail the conduct or circumstances justifying the
order.
(CRC, rule 2.30(a)-(e).)
The Court will hear argument.
Plaintiff is ordered to pay the filing fee for
combining the SROG and FROG motion.
