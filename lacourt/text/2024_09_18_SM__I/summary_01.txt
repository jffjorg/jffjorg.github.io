And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling in a case filed against a contractor, Simzar, by Michael Amin and his wife, Shirin, who are trustees of their respective trusts. The plaintiffs allege various construction problems and seek damages. The defendant filed a demurrer arguing that the complaint is uncertain and that the statute of limitations has expired. The court disagrees with the uncertainty argument and finds that the complaint is clear. However, the court sustains the demurrer as to Shirin, finding that she is bringing a new claim separate from Michael's claim, and that the addition of Shirin as a plaintiff does not relate back to the original complaint. The court will inquire about granting leave to amend the complaint.
