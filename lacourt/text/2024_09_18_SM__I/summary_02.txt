And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer and motion to strike filed by California Mental Health Services Authority (CalMHSA) in a lawsuit against Cause Communications. The case involves a dispute over a contract for a program called "We Rise" and an alleged false claim by Cause Communications for $400,000.

The judge has overruled the demurrer on the ground that CalMHSA is a "prosecuting authority" under the California False Claims Act, which allows it to bring a lawsuit in its own name. The judge has also denied the motion to strike the opposition to the demurrer.

The judge has also ruled on a separate issue involving a breach of contract claim by CalMHSA, finding that the notice requirements in the contract were substantially complied with and that the alleged breach is not a technicality.

The court has granted CalMHSA's request to continue the hearing and has given it until noon the next day to file a reply to the opposition to the motion to strike.
