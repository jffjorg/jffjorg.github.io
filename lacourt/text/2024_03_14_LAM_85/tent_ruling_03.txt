 Case Number:  24STCV04202    Hearing Date:   March 14, 2024    Dept:  85 
Darren Haas and Heather
Strauch v. Peak Foreclosure Services, Inc. and Richards Real Estate, Inc., 24STCV04202
Tentative decision on preliminary injunction enjoining foreclosure sales:
 granted



 
            
            Plaintiffs
Darren Haas (“Haas”) and Heather Strauch (“Strauch”) apply for a preliminary
injunction enjoining Defendants Peak Foreclosure Services, Inc. (“Peak”) and
Richards Real Estate, Inc. (“Richards”) from conducting a trustee’s sale or
otherwise disposing of 745 Eighth Place, Hermosa Beach, CA (“Eighth Property”)
or 825 Pacific Coast Highway, Hermosa Beach, CA (“Pacific Property”).
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers and Richards’ opposition (no
opposition from Peak is on file),[1] and
renders the following tentative decision. 
 
            A.
Statement of the Case
            1.
Complaint
            Plaintiffs
commenced this proceeding on February 19, 2024, alleging (1) wrongful
foreclosure, (2) violation of Civil Code sections 2924 et. seq., (3)
declaratory relief, and (4) injunctive relief. 
The verified Complaint alleges in pertinent part as follows.
            Haas
and Strauch each own a 50% undivided interest in each Property as tenants-in-common.  In August 2020, Plaintiffs executed two separate
Line of Credit Promissory Notes for $600,000 (“Eighth Note” and “Pacific Note”)
in favor of Thompson Falls, LLC (“Thompson”), secured by their interests in the
Properties.  Although the Eighth Note
misstates the address as “745 Pacific Coast Highway,” the deed of trust for the
Eighth Note (“Eighth DOT”) reflects the correct address.
            Neither
Plaintiff has requested or received an advance under any of the Notes and no
amount is due thereunder.  Despite this,
in January 2024, Plaintiffs received a Notice of Trustee’s Sale (“NOS”) for
each Property alleging default under the two DOTs.  
            Plaintiffs
contacted Thompson representative Brian Dozier (“Dozier”), who informed them that
Thompson had transferred its rights and obligations under the Notes to
Richards.  Dozier assured Plaintiffs he
would contact Richards’ principal, Leslie Richards (“Leslie”), and have the
mistake corrected.
            On
February 18, 2024, Dozier advised Plaintiffs that Leslie orally agreed to call
off the sales.  To date, Leslie has not
provided written confirmation.
            Plaintiffs
seek actual damages, a judicial declaration voiding each NOS and Notice of
Default (“NOD”), injunctive relief enjoining foreclosure on the Properties, and
attorneys’ fees and costs.
 
            2.
Course of Proceedings
            On
February 21, 2024, the court granted Plaintiff’s ex parte application
for a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) and order to show cause re:
preliminary injunction (“OSC”) to enjoin Defendants from conducting a
foreclosure sale as to either Property.
            On
February 22, 2024, Plaintiffs personally served Defendants with the Complaint,
Summons, and moving papers for the ex parte application.
            
            B.
Applicable Law
            An
injunction is a writ or order requiring a person to refrain from a particular
act; it may be granted by the court in which the action is brought, or by a
judge thereof; and when granted by a judge, it may be enforced as an order of
the court.  CCP §525.  An injunction may be more completely defined
as a writ or order commanding a person either to perform or to refrain from
performing a particular act.  See Comfort
v. Comfort, (1941) 17 Cal.2d 736, 741. McDowell v. Watson, (1997) 59
Cal.App.4th 1155, 1160.[2]  It is an equitable remedy available generally
in the protection or to prevent the invasion of a legal right.  Meridian, Ltd. v. City and County of San
Francisco, et al., (1939) 13 Cal.2d 424.
            The
purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo
pending final resolution upon a trial.  See
Scaringe v. J.C.C. Enterprises, Inc., (1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 1536. Grothe
v. Cortlandt Corp., (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1313, 1316; Major v. Miraverde
Homeowners Assn., (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 618, 623.  The status quo has been defined to
mean the last actual peaceable, uncontested status which preceded the pending
controversy.  Voorhies v. Greene
(1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 989, 995, quoting United Railroads v. Superior Court,
(1916) 172 Cal. 80, 87. 14859 Moorpark Homeowner’s Assn. v. VRT Corp.,
(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1396. 1402.
            A
preliminary injunction is issued after hearing on a noticed motion.  The complaint normally must plead injunctive
relief.  CCP §526(a)(1)-(2).[3]  Preliminary injunctive relief requires the
use of competent evidence to create a sufficient factual showing on the grounds
for relief.  See e.g. Ancora-Citronelle
Corp. v. Green, (1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 146, 150.  Injunctive relief may be granted based on a
verified complaint only if it contains sufficient evidentiary, not ultimate,
facts.  See CCP §527(a).  For this reason, a pleading alone rarely
suffices.  Weil & Brown, California
Procedure Before Trial, 9:579, 9(ll)-21 (The Rutter Group 2007).  The burden of proof is on the plaintiff as
moving party.  O’Connell v. Superior
Court, (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1452, 1481. 
            A
plaintiff seeking injunctive relief must show the absence of an adequate
damages remedy at law.  CCP §526(4); Thayer
Plymouth Center, Inc. v. Chrysler Motors, (1967) 255 Cal.App.2d 300, 307; Department
of Fish & Game v. Anderson-Cottonwood Irrigation Dist., (1992) 8
Cal.App.4th 1554, 1565.  The concept of
“inadequacy of the legal remedy” or “inadequacy of damages” dates from the time
of the early courts of chancery, the idea being that an injunction is an
unusual or extraordinary equitable remedy which will not be granted if the
remedy at law (usually damages) will adequately compensate the injured
plaintiff.  Department of Fish &
Game v. Anderson-Cottonwood Irrigation Dist., (1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 1554,
1565.
            In
determining whether to issue a preliminary injunction, the trial court
considers two factors: (1) the reasonable probability that the plaintiff will
prevail on the merits at trial (CCP §526(a)(1)), and (2) a balancing of the
“irreparable harm” that the plaintiff is likely to sustain if the injunction is
denied as compared to the harm that the defendant is likely to suffer if the
court grants a preliminary injunction. 
CCP §526(a)(2); 14859 Moorpark Homeowner’s Assn. v. VRT Corp.,
(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1396. 1402; Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro v.
Schectman, (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1283; Davenport v. Blue Cross of
California, (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 435, 446; Abrams v. St. Johns Hospital,
(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 628, 636.  Thus, a
preliminary injunction may not issue without some showing of potential
entitlement to such relief.  Doe v.
Wilson, (1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 296, 304. 
The decision to grant a preliminary injunction generally lies within the
sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent
an abuse of discretion.  Thornton v.
Carlson, (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 1249, 1255.
            A
preliminary injunction ordinarily cannot take effect unless and until the
plaintiff provides an undertaking for damages which the enjoined defendant may
sustain by reason of the injunction if the court finally decides that the
plaintiff was not entitled to the injunction. 
See CCP §529(a); City of South San Francisco v. Cypress Lawn
Cemetery Assn., (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 916, 920.

Statement of Facts
            Plaintiffs,
who are siblings, each own a 50% undivided interest as tenants-in-common for both
Properties.  Haas Decl., ¶¶ 1-3; Strauch
Decl., ¶¶ 1-3.
            In
August 2020, Plaintiffs signed the Eighth Note and the Pacific Note in
Thompson’s favor to borrow up to $600,000 against each Property.  Haas Decl., ¶¶ 4-5, Exs. A, C; Strauch Decl.,
¶¶ 4-5, Exs. A, C.  Under the Notes, Plaintiffs
had the right to request loan advances from Thompson.  Haas Decl., ¶¶ 4-5, Exs. A, C; Strauch Decl.,
¶¶ 4-5, Exs. A, C.  The advances were to
be reflected on Schedule A, which was blank when Plaintiffs signed the Notes.  Haas Decl., ¶¶ 4-5, Exs. A, C; Strauch Decl.,
¶¶ 4-5, Exs. A, C.  Plaintiffs’ managing
member would initial the entry on the Schedule when they received the
advance.  Haas Decl., ¶¶ 4-5, Exs. A, C;
Strauch Decl., ¶¶ 4-5, Exs. A, C.  Interest
would accrue at a 6% annual rate until August 14, 2023, when the Notes would
mature.  Haas Decl., ¶¶ 4-5, Exs. A, C;
Strauch Decl., ¶¶ 4-5, Exs. A, C.  Interest
would then accrue from inception at a 6.5% rate.  Haas Decl., ¶¶ 4-5, Exs. A, C; Strauch Decl.,
¶¶ 4-5, Exs. A, C. 
            Each
Note was secured by a DOT recorded against that Property in Thompson’s
favor.  Haas Decl., ¶¶ 4-5, Exs. B, D;
Strauch Decl., ¶¶ 4-5, Exs. B, D. 
Although the Eighth Note lists the Eighth Property’s address as “745
Pacific Coast Highway, Hermosa Beach, CA 90254,” the Eighth DOT lists the
correct address as “745 Eighth Place Hermosa Beach, CA 90254.”  Haas Decl., ¶4, Exs. A-B.  Plaintiffs do not own an interest in Property
at 745 Pacific Coast Highway, Hermosa Beach, CA 90254.  Haas Decl., ¶4.
            Plaintiffs
never requested nor received an advance under either Note.  Haas Decl., ¶6; Strauch Decl., ¶6.  Despite this, in January 2024, Peak sent
Plaintiffs a NOS for each Property.  Haas
Decl., ¶7, Exs. E-F; Strauch Decl., ¶7, Exs. E-F.  Because neither Plaintiff has withdrawn money
under the Notes, neither is in default and the foreclosure sales are
improper.  Haas Decl., ¶9; Strauch Decl.,
¶9.  
            Plaintiffs
contacted Thompson representative Dozier, who informed them Thompson had
transferred to Richards its rights and obligations under the Notes.  Haas Decl., ¶8; Strauch Decl., ¶8.  Dozier assured Plaintiffs that he would
contact Richards’ principal, Leslie, and have the mistake corrected.  Haas Decl., ¶8; Strauch Decl., ¶8.  Dozier repeated this during daily
conversations.  Haas Decl., ¶8; Strauch
Decl., ¶8.  
            On
February 18, 2024, Dozier advised Plaintiffs that Leslie orally had agreed to
call off the sales.  Haas Decl., ¶9;
Strauch Decl., ¶9.  To date, Leslie has
not provided written confirmation.  Haas
Decl., ¶9; Strauch Decl., ¶9.  
            The
estimated value of the Eighth and Pacific Properties on real estate websites are
$1.3-$1.5 million and $1.5 million, respectively.  Haas Decl., ¶¶ 11-12; Strauch Decl., ¶¶ 11-12.  Assuming arguendo Plaintiffs had drawn
the maximum $600,000 on each line of credit, the maximum owed on each Note
after 6.5% annual interest would be $726,509.59.  Ficenec Decl., ¶5.
            
            D.
Analysis
            Plaintiffs
seek a preliminary injunction enjoining the foreclosure sale of the Properties.
 
            1.
Probability of Success
            The
Complaint’s first cause of action is for wrongful foreclosure.  Plaintiffs provide evidence that they signed
two Notes in August 2020 to borrow up to $600,000 against each Property.  Haas Decl., ¶¶ 4-5, Exs. A, C; Strauch Decl.,
¶¶ 4-5, Exs. A, C.  Each Note was secured
by a DOT recorded in Thompson’s favor against that Property.  Haas Decl., ¶¶ 4-5, Exs. B, D; Strauch Decl.,
¶¶ 4-5, Exs. B, D.   Thompson later assigned these Notes and DOTs to
Richards.  Haas Decl., ¶8; Strauch Decl.,
¶8.  
            Under
the Notes, Plaintiffs received the right to request loans and advances.  Haas Decl., ¶¶ 4-5, Exs. A, C; Strauch Decl.,
¶¶ 4-5, Exs. A, C.  The advances were to
be reflected on Schedule A, which was blank when Plaintiffs signed the
Notes.  Haas Decl., ¶¶ 4-5, Exs. A, C;
Strauch Decl., ¶¶ 4-5, Exs. A, C. 
Plaintiffs’ managing member was to initial the entry on the Schedule when
they received the advance.  Haas Decl.,
¶¶ 4-5, Exs. A, C; Strauch Decl., ¶¶ 4-5, Exs. A, C.  
            In
January 2024, Peak sent Plaintiffs a NOS for each Property.  Haas Decl., ¶7, Exs. E-F; Strauch Decl., ¶7,
Exs. E-F.  Plaintiffs never withdrew
money under the Notes and are not in default. 
Haas Decl., ¶9; Strauch Decl., ¶9. 
 Defendants do not have the right
to foreclose on either Property.  Haas
Decl., ¶9; Strauch Decl., ¶9.  
            Plaintiffs
have demonstrated a probability of success on their claim for wrongful
disclosure.  
 
            2.
Balance of Hardships
            In
determining whether to issue a preliminary injunction, the second factor which
a trial court examines is the interim harm that plaintiff is likely to sustain
if the injunction is denied as compared to the harm that the defendant is
likely to suffer if the court grants a preliminary injunction.  Donahue Schriber Realty Group, Inc. v. Nu
Creation Outreach, (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 1171, 1177.  This factor involves consideration of the
inadequacy of other remedies, the degree of irreparable harm, and the necessity
of preserving the status quo.  Id.
            Plaintiffs
assert that the harm Defendants will incur due to an injunction is non-existent.  Mot. at 5-6. 
The estimated value of the Eighth and Pacific Properties on real estate
websites is $1.3-$1.5 million and $1.5 million, respectively.  Haas Decl., ¶¶ 11-12; Strauch Decl., ¶¶ 11-12.  Even if Plaintiffs had drawn the maximum
$600,000 on each line of credit, the maximum owed on each Note after 6.5%
annual interest would be $726,509.59. 
Ficenec Decl., ¶5.  Defendants are
over-secured by more than $500,000 per Note. 
Mot. at 5-6.
            The
court need not discuss this in detail.  Real
property is a unique asset.  Where land is
the subject matter, the inadequacy of the legal remedy is well settled, and the
equitable jurisdiction is firmly established. 
Stockton v. Newman (1957), 148 Cal. App. 2d 558, 564.  Plaintiffs would lose ownership of the
Properties if the foreclosure sales proceed. 
At worst, Defendants’ financial harm from the improvident issuance of a preliminary
injunction will be compensated by eventual foreclosure sales.
            The
balance of hardships strongly favors a preliminary injunction.
 
            E.
Conclusion 
            The
application for a preliminary injunction is granted.  The court must
require a bond supporting the preliminary injunction.¿ The purpose of a bond is
to cover the defendant’s damages from an improvidently issued injunction.¿ CCP
§529(a).¿ In setting the bond, the court must assume that the preliminary
injunction was wrongly issued.¿ Abba Rubber Co. v. Seaquist, (“Abba”)
(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1, 15.¿ The damages include any lost
profits resulting from the injunction.  See
Allen v. Pitchess, (1973) 36 Cal.App.3d 321, 327-28.  The attorney’s fees necessary to successfully
procure a final decision dissolving the injunction also are damages that should
be included in setting the bond.  Abba,
supra, 235 Cal.App.3d at 15-16.  While Abba reasoned that the
plaintiff’s likelihood of prevailing is irrelevant to setting the bond, a more
recent case disagreed, stating that the greater the likelihood of the plaintiff
prevailing, the less likely the preliminary injunction will have been wrongly
issued, and that is a relevant factor for setting the bond.  Oiye v. Fox, (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th
1036, 1062.  In lieu of a bond, the judge
may permit a deposit into court.  CCP
§995.710.
             Richards opposes on the basis that Plaintiffs
must post an undertaking and requests a $1,200,000 undertaking to reflect the
two $600,000 lines of credit under the Notes. 
Opp. at 2.  
The harm caused by a wrongfully issued preliminary
injunction is not the line of credit itself. 
Rather, it is the amount of damage Richards will sustain from a delayed
foreclosure.  This ordinarily is the lost
use of the foreclosure sale proceeds during the pendency of the lawsuit, plus plus
attorney’s fees incurred in setting aside the preliminary injunction, whether
by motion or at trial.  Defendants present
no evidence on this issue.  The bond is
set at $1500, cash or corporate surety.
