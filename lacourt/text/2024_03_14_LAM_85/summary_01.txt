And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling confirms the appointment of a receiver to collect rents and profits from the Properties and enforces the assignment of rents provision in the deed of trust. The court finds that the Plaintiff, Lone Oak Fund, LLC, has demonstrated a prima facie case for the appointment of a receiver due to the Defendant, Beverly Hills Flats, LLC's, default under the Lone Oak Note and deed of trust. The default includes failure to repay the principal after two extensions of the maturity date, failure to pay the 2023 property taxes, and failure to comply with the terms of the Lone Oak Note and deed of trust. The court grants the Plaintiff's request for a preliminary injunction enjoining both parties from interfering with the Receiver and directing them to turn over all property, related records and documents, and rents and profits in their possession, custody, or control.
