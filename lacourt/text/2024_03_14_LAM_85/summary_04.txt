And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by the Judge regarding a future Court Hearing in the case of Richards. The Judge is disappointed that Richards failed to lodge a courtesy copy of the opposition in violation of the Presiding Judge's First Amended General Order Re: Mandatory Electronic Filing, and warns Richards' counsel to provide courtesy copies in all future filings.

The Judge also discusses the substance of an injunction, citing Agricultural Labor Relations Bd. v. Superior Court and Teachers Ins. & Annuity Assoc. v. Furlotti. The Judge notes that a mandatory injunction, which requires a party to take affirmative action, carries a heavy burden and is not typically granted. However, a court may issue an injunction to maintain the status quo without a cause of action in the complaint, as stated in CCP ยง526(a)(3).

Overall, the Judge's tentative ruling provides guidance on the procedures for filing documents with the court and the standards for issuing injunctions.
