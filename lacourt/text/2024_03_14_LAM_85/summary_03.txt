And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has considered the evidence presented by the parties and has made a tentative decision to grant the preliminary injunction sought by the plaintiffs, Darren Haas and Heather Strauch. The plaintiffs are seeking to prevent the foreclosure sales of two properties, 745 Eighth Place and 825 Pacific Coast Highway, both located in Hermosa Beach, California. The plaintiffs allege that the foreclosure sales are wrongful because they have not defaulted on their loans and that the defendants, Peak Foreclosure Services, Inc. and Richards Real Estate, Inc., have no right to foreclose on the properties.

The judge has found that the plaintiffs have demonstrated a probability of success on their claim for wrongful foreclosure and that the balance of hardships favors granting the preliminary injunction. The judge has also set the bond for the preliminary injunction at $1,500, cash or corporate surety.

The judge has ordered that the foreclosure sales be stayed pending the final resolution of the lawsuit, and that the defendants post a bond to cover any damages that may be sustained as a result of the preliminary injunction. The judge has also scheduled a hearing on the preliminary injunction for March 14, 2024.
