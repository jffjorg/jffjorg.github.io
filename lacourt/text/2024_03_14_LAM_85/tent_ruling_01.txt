  Case Number:  24STCV03052    Hearing Date:   March 14, 2024    Dept:  85 
Lone Oak Fund, LLC v. Beverly
Hills Flats, LLC et al., 24STCV03052
 
Tentative decision on confirmation
of appointment of receiver: granted



            
 
            Plaintiff
Lone Oak Fund, LLC (“Lone Oak”) seeks confirmation of the appointment of Kevin
Singer (“Receiver”) for 1009 N. Croft Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90069
(“1009 Property”) and 1015 N. Croft Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90069
(“1015 Property”).
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers (no opposition is on file) and
renders the following tentative decision.  
 
            A.
Statement of the Case
            1.
The Complaint
            Plaintiff
Lone Oak commenced this action on February 5, 2024 against Defendant Beverly
Hills Flats, LLC (“Flats”) and Nominal Defendant Davoud Kobaei (“Kobaei”) as
Trustee of the DPK Family Trust (“Trust”). 
The Complaint alleges (1) judicial foreclosure of real property and (2) specific
performance of assignment of rents, issues, and profits, along with appointment
of receiver and injunctive relief.  The
Complaint alleges in pertinent part as follows.
            Defendant
Flats owns the Properties, each of which consists of a seven-unit apartment
building with a floor area of 6,499 square feet.  
On October 2, 2020, Lone Oak loaned Flats (“Lone Oak Loan”)
$4.44 million via a loan agreement (“Lone Oak Loan Agreement”) and Note (“Lone
Oak Note”).  Farhad Farahmand (“Farahmand”)
executed the Note on Flats’ behalf.  The
Note provided for interest only payments of $21,633.33 per month based on a
cumulative 5.9% rate on the first of each month from December 1, 2020
thereafter.  The balance would then be
due and payable on September 30, 2021.
            The
Lone Oak Note defined default to include any event of default so defined in the
deed of trust recorded against the Properties (“Lone Oak DOT”) to secure the
loan.  The Lone Oak DOT defines an event
of default to include, inter alia, (a) failure to make any payment of
principal or interest on the Lone Oak Note when due; and (d) mortgage,
assignment, or further encumbrance of the Properties without Lone Oak’s prior
written consent.
            Upon
an event of default, the Lone Oak Note allows Lone Oak to declare due the
outstanding principal and all interest accrued. 
The annual interest rate upon default or maturity of the Loan will also
increase to 24%.  
            The
Lone Oak DOT assigns all rights to receive rentals, income, receipts, issues
and profits from the Properties to Lone Oak. 
Pursuant to Civil Code section 2938, the Lone Oak DOT provides for
appointment of a receiver to take possession of and manage the Property and
collect all rent from it.  The Lone Oak DOT
also gave Lone Oak the right to declare all secured obligations immediately due
and payable.
            In
January 2021, Flats obtained a junior loan in a second position from Kobaei as
Trust’s Trustee for $2.95 million.  This
loan was secured by a Deed of Trust against the Properties in Trust’s favor
(“Trust DOT”).  This junior loan was a
material breach of the Lone Oak Note and Lone Oak DOT.
            On
October 13, 2021, Lone Oak and the Defendants entered a Loan Modification
(“Lone Oak First Modification”) extending the Lone Oak Loan’s maturity date to September
30, 2022.  On September 22, 2022, Lone
Oak and Defendants entered a second Loan Modification (“Lone Oak Second
Modification”) extending the Lone Oak Loan’s maturity date to September 30, 2023.  
            When
the Lone Oak Loan matured on September 30, 2023, Flats failed to pay the
outstanding balance despite demand to do so. 
This was another material breach of the Lone Oak Loan and meant that interest
accrued at the 24% annual default rate beginning October 1, 2023.
            Flats
further failed to pay the 2023 property taxes for the 1009 Property and the
1015 Property.  
            Lone
Oak has declared a default per the Lone Oak Note and Lone Oak DOT.  Both documents also entitle Lone Oak to
attorney’s fees and costs incurred in legal action to enforce them.
 
            2.
Course of Proceedings
            On
February 8, 2024, this court granted Lone Oak’s ex parte application for
a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) and appointment of a receiver for the
Properties.
            On
February 9, 2024, the proposed receiver, Kevin Singer (“Singer”) signed the
Oath of a Receiver.  Also on February 9,
Lone Oak posted a $1,500 undertaking for the TRO and a $1,500 undertaking for
the appointment of a receiver. Singer posted a $10,000 undertaking as Receiver.
            Also
on February 9, 2024, Lone Oak personally served Flats with the Complaint,
Summons, ex parte application for a TRO, moving papers, and the granted
order.  Lone Oak personally served Flats’
attorney with the ex parte order on February 12, 2024.
            On
February 13, 2024, Lone Oak personally served Kobaei with the Complaint,
Summons, ex parte application for a TRO, moving papers, and the granted
order.  It also served Flats the same
documents by substitute service, effective February 23, 2024.
            
            B.
Applicable Law
            CCP
section 564(b) provides that the court has authority to appoint a receiver in
any of the following pertinent circumstances: (2) In an action by a secured
lender for the foreclosure of a deed of trust or mortgage and sale of property
upon which there is a lien under a deed of trust or mortgage, where it appears
that the property is in danger of being lost, removed, or materially injured,
or that the condition of the deed of trust or mortgage has not been performed,
and that the property is probably insufficient to discharge the deed of trust
or mortgage debt; (9) in all other cases where necessary to preserve the
property or rights of any party; (11) in an action by a secured lender for
specific performance of an assignment of rents provision in a deed of trust,
mortgage, or separate assignment document; and (12) in a case brought by an
assignee under an assignment of leases, rents, issues, or profits pursuant to
Civil Code section 2938(g).
            Upon
default of the assignor under the obligation secured by the assignment of
leases, rents, issues, and profits, Civil Code section 2938(c)(1) allows the
assignee to enforce the assignment via appointment of a receiver.  
            The
appointment of a receiver is a drastic remedy to be utilized only in
“exceptional cases.”  As such, a receiver
should not be appointed unless absolutely essential and because no other remedy
will serve its purpose.  City &
County of San Francisco v. Daley, (“Daley”) (1993) 16 Cal.App.4th
734, 744.  
            Once
appointed, a receiver has, under the control of the court, power to bring and
defend actions in his own name, as receiver; to take and keep possession of the
property, to receive rents, collect debts, to compound for and compromise the
same, to make transfers, and generally to do such acts respecting the property
as the court may authorize.  CCP §568.

Statement of Facts[1]
            1.
Loan Agreements
            On
October 8, 2020, a grant deed was recorded transferring the 1015 Property to
Flats.  RJN Ex. 1.  Flats owns the Properties, each of which
consists of a seven-unit apartment building with a floor area of 6,499 square
feet.  Rothstein Decl., ¶3.  Flats’ Statement of Information lists
Farahmand as its managing member. 
Rothstein Decl., ¶3; RJN Ex. 2.
            On
October 2, 2020, Lone Oak loaned Flats $4.44 million via the Lone Oak Loan
Agreement and Lone Oak Note, both of which Farahmand signed.  Rothstein Decl., ¶¶ 4-6, Exs. A-B.  The interest rate under the Lone Oak Note was
5.9%.  Rothstein Decl., ¶6, Ex. B.  Under section 1.4, on the first of each month
from December 1, 2020 thereafter, Flats was required to pay all interest
accrued, or $21,633.33 per month, and would pay the principal balance on the
maturity date, defined in section 1.1 as September 30, 2021.  Rothstein Decl., ¶6, Ex. B.  
            Section
1.12 of the Note defines “Default” as the occurrence of an Event of Default
under the Lone Oak DOT.  Rothstein Decl.,
¶7, Ex. B.  Default entitles Lone Oak to
declare immediately due and payable the outstanding principal and all interest
accrued to that point.  Rothstein Decl.,
¶8, Ex. B.  The annual interest rate upon
default or maturity of the Loan increases to 24%.  Rothstein Decl., ¶9, Ex. B.  
            To
secure the loan, the Lone Oak DOT was recorded against the Properties.  Rothstein Decl., ¶10; RJN Ex. 3.  It assigned to Lone Oak all interest in leases,
rents, and revenue from the Properties as security for the Loan.  Rothstein Decl., ¶¶ 11-12; RJN Ex. 3.  It granted Flats a license to collect and
retain payments under such leases as they became due until an Event of Default
under the Lone Oak DOT.  Rothstein Decl.,
¶13; RJN Ex. 3.  
            Section
4.1 of the Lone Oak DOT defines an Event of Default to include, inter alia,
(a) failure to make any payment of principal or interest on the Lone Oak Note
when due; (b) failure to pay any other amount when due and payable under the
Lone Oak Note; (d) mortgage, assignment, or further encumbrance of the
Properties without Lone Oak’s prior written consent; and (g) existence of any
Default as defined in the “Loan Documents,” including the Lone Oak Loan
Agreement and Lone Oak Note.  Rothstein
Decl., ¶14; RJN Ex. 3.  Upon such an
Event, section 4.2 of the Lone Oak DOT gives Lone Oak the right to pursue all
rights and remedies, including the right to, inter alia, (a) declare all
secured obligations immediately due and payable, (c) foreclose on the Lone Oak
DOT, and (d) apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for, and obtain,
appointment of a receiver of the Properties as a matter of strict right and
without regard to the adequacy of the security for the repayment of the
Loan.  Rothstein Decl., ¶15; RJN Ex.
3.  
            On
October 13, 2021, Lone Oak and Defendants entered the Lone Oak First
Modification.  Rothstein Decl., ¶16, Ex.
C.  It extended the Lone Oak Loan’s
maturity date to September 30, 2022.  Rothstein
Decl., ¶16, Ex. C.  In exchange, the annual
interest rate would increase to 6.4% beginning April 1, 2022.  Rothstein Decl., ¶16, Ex. C.  On the first of each month, Flats was to pay
all interest accrued up to that point, or $23,680 per month.  Rothstein Decl., ¶16, Ex. C.  It would then pay the principal balance on
the maturity date.  Rothstein Decl., ¶16,
Ex. C.
            On
September 22, 2022, Lone Oak and Defendants entered a Lone Oak Second
Modification.  Rothstein Decl., ¶17, Ex.
D.  It extended the Lone Oak Loan’s
maturity date to September 30, 2023. 
Rothstein Decl., ¶17, Ex. D.  In
exchange, the annual interest rate would increase to 7.9%.  Rothstein Decl., ¶17, Ex. D.  On the first of each month, Flats was required
to pay all interest accrued up to that point, or $29,230.  Rothstein Decl., ¶17, Ex. D.  It would then pay the principal balance on
the maturity date.  Rothstein Decl., ¶17,
Ex. D.  
 
            2.
Defaults
            In
January 2021, Flats obtained a junior loan in a second position from Kobaei as
Trust’s Trustee for $2.95 million.  Rothstein
Decl., ¶19.  This loan was secured by the
Trust DOT against the Properties, recorded January 19, 2021.  Rothstein Decl., ¶19, RJN Ex. 4.  This was a material breach of the Lone Oak
Note and Lone Oak DOT.  Rothstein Decl.,
¶20.
            When
the Lone Oak Loan matured on September 30, 2023, Flats failed to pay the
outstanding balance despite demand to do so. 
Rothstein Decl., ¶21.  This was
another material breach of the Lone Oak Loan. 
Rothstein Decl., ¶21.  
            Flats
failed to pay the 2023 property taxes totaling $25,748.38 for the 1009 Property
and $25,747.06 for the 1015 Property. 
Rothstein Decl., ¶23, Exs. E-F.  These
taxes became delinquent on December 11, 2023. 
Rothstein Decl., ¶23, Exs. E-F. 
Lone Oak also expects Flats to miss the April 10, 2024 deadline to pay
property taxes of $23,403.31 for each Property. 
Rothstein Decl., ¶23, Exs. E-F.  
            Lone
Oak has declared default under the Lone Oak Note and DOT.  Rothstein Decl., ¶24.  This means that interest has accrued at the
24% annual default rate beginning October 1, 2023.  Rothstein Decl., ¶25.  
On January 19, 2024, Lone Oak recorded a Substitution of
Trustee assigning its interest in the Lone Oak DOT to Peak Foreclosure Services
(“Peak”).  Rothstein Decl., ¶26; RJN Ex.
5.  Later that day, Peak recorded a
Notice of Default and Election to Sell (“NOD”) under the Lone Oak DOT.  Rothstein Decl., ¶26; RJN Ex. 6. 
 
            3.
Rents and Maintenance
            An
onsite inspection shows that Flats has rented out units on the Properties and
collects rent from them.  Rothstein
Decl., ¶27.  It has not used this revenue
to repay the balance on the Lone Oak Loan. 
Rothstein Decl., ¶27.  
            The
inspection also revealed that Flats has left some units vacant, possibly in
anticipation of developing the Properties. 
Rothstein Decl., ¶28.  When the
parties signed the Lone Oak Note, Flats produced a rent roll showing annual
rent income of $318,192.48.   Rothstein
Decl., ¶28, Ex. G.  Failure to rent all
units negatively impacts Lone Oak and diminishes the Properties’ value.  Rothstein Decl., ¶28.  A receiver is needed to collect existing rent
and to rent vacant units to increase revenue. 
Rothstein Decl., ¶28.  
            The
inspection also revealed signs of vandalism and a lack of necessary repairs to
the Properties.  Rothstein Decl.,
¶29.  Flats’ failure to act in the
Properties’ best interests has risked diminution of the value of Lone Oak’s security
under the Lone Oak Note.  Rothstein
Decl., ¶29.  
            Based
on the sum of the principal owed, default interest, foreclosure fees,
reconveyance fees, inspection fees, and attorney’s fees, less a $29,230 partial
payment, Flats owes $4,768,078.14 as of January 23, 2014.  Rothstein Decl., ¶30.
 
            4.
Receiver
            Singer
is the founder and president of Empire Brokerage & Real Estate Services,
Inc.  Singer Decl., ¶2.  His company specializes in both state and
federal court receiverships, referee assignments, partition sales, professional
trustee assignments, real estate & business brokering, and real estate
consulting for receiverships.  Singer
Decl., ¶2.  Singer has served as a
receiver for 530 state cases in the last twenty-four years.  Singer Decl., ¶¶ 3-4, Ex. A.  
            Hourly
rates range from $295 for the principal and partners to $85 for
bookkeepers.  Singer Decl., ¶6.
 
            D.
Analysis
            Plaintiff
Lone Oak seeks confirmation of the appointment of Receiver to preserve the Properties
and collect rents and profits.  No
opposition has been filed.
            CCP
section 564(b) provides that the court has authority to appoint a receiver, inter
alia, (2) in an action by a secured lender for the foreclosure of a deed of
trust or mortgage and sale of property upon which there is a lien under a deed
of trust or mortgage, where it appears that the property is in danger of being
lost, removed, or materially injured, or that the condition of the deed of
trust or mortgage has not been performed, and that the property is probably
insufficient to discharge the deed of trust or mortgage debt; (9) in all other
cases where necessary to preserve the property or rights of any party; (11) in
an action by a secured lender for specific performance of an assignment of
rents provision in a deed of trust, mortgage, or separate assignment document;
and (12) in a case brought by an assignee under an assignment of leases, rents,
issues, or profits pursuant to Civil Code section 2938(g).
            Upon
default of the assignor under the obligation secured by the assignment of
leases, rents, issues, and profits, Civil Code section 2938(c)(1) allows the
assignee to enforce the assignment via appointment of a receiver.  
            On
October 2, 2020, Lone Oak loaned Flats $4.44 million via a Lone Oak Loan
Agreement and Lone Oak Note.  Rothstein
Decl., ¶¶ 4-6, Exs. A-B.  This loan was
secured by a Lone Oak DOT which assigned to Lone Oak all rent Flats obtained from
leasing the Properties.  Rothstein Decl.,
¶¶ 11-12; RJN Ex. 3.  
            Section
4.1 of the Lone Oak DOT defines an Event of Default to include, inter alia,
(a)  failure to make any payment of
principal or interest on the Lone Oak Note when due; (b) failure to pay any
other amount when due and payable under the Lone Oak Note; and (c) mortgage,
assignment, or further encumbrance of the Properties without Lone Oak’s prior
written consent;.  Rothstein Decl., ¶14;
RJN Ex. 3.  Under the Lone Oak Note,
default entitled Lone Oak to declare immediately due and payable the
outstanding principal and all interest accrued to that point.  Rothstein Decl., ¶8, Ex. B.  The annual interest rate upon default or
maturity of the Loan increased to 24%. 
Rothstein Decl., ¶9, Ex. B.  
            Lone
Oak asserts three forms of default under the Lone Oak Note and DOT.  Flats has failed to repay the principal after
two extensions of the maturity date.  Rothstein
Decl., ¶¶ 21-22, Exs. C-D.  Flats also obtained
a loan from Trust and recorded a junior DOT against the Properties.  Rothstein Decl., ¶19, RJN Ex. 4.  Flats further failed to pay the 2023 property
taxes, totaling $25,748.38 for the 1009 Property and $25,747.06 for the 1015
Property.  Rothstein Decl., ¶23, Exs.
E-F.  Because of Flats’ default, Lone Oak
may invoke remedies under the Lone Oak DOT, including the right to a receiver
to collect the rents assigned thereunder. 
Rothstein Decl., ¶15; RJN Ex. 3.  
 
            E. Conclusion
            The
appointment of Receiver to maintain the Properties and collect rents and
properties is confirmed.  A preliminary
injunction will issue enjoining both parties from interfering with Receiver,
compelling them to cooperate with Receiver, and directing them to turn over all
property, related records and documents, and rents and profits in their
possession, custody, or control.  Lone
Oak has posted $1,500 undertakings each for the TRO and appointment of a
receiver.  Receiver has posted a $10,000
undertaking for his receivership.  The
TRO bond will function as the preliminary injunction bond.
