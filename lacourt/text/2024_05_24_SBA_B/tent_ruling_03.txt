RULING
            The demurrer is SUSTAINED WITH LEAVE
TO AMEND.
BACKGROUND
            On January 17, 2024, plaintiffs Jodi
Mannino, as trustee of the Jodi Elizabeth Mannino Trust, under Agreement dated June
16, 2014, and Jan Satterfield, as trustee of the Jan Satterfield Revocable
Trust dated December 5, 2017, filed a verified partition complaint against
defendant Jay F. Mannino, as trustee of the Jay F. Mannino Trust created u/d/t
dated January 26, 2009.[1]  The Plaintiffs allege that they are co-owners
of 3 parcels of real property and seek the partition of those properties.  The 3 properties are identified as 14800
South Avalon Blvd., Gardena, 14823 South Avalon Blvd., Gardena, and 850 E. 111th
Place, Los Angeles.
            On March 28, 2024, cross-complainant
Jay F. Mannino as trustee filed a cross-complaint against cross-defendants Jodi
Mannino and Jan Satterfield, alleging (1) breach of fiduciary duty; and (2)
waste. Cross complainant alleges that prior to May 2021, the property located
at 111 Place was leased to a tenant at a rental rate substantially below fair
market rental value. He alleges that:
“In or about May 2021, against
JAY’s will, and over his objection to JODI and SATTERFIELD that the renewal was
being made at a below market rate, JODI and SATTERFIELD entered into a five (5)
year extension of the lease effective as of May 1, 2021, at a sub-market rate
of $0.31/Sq ft of land area on a triple net (NNN) basis. JAY refused to sign
the Lease Extension.”  (¶ 11)
            On April 29, 2024, cross-defendants
filed the instant demurrer to the cross-complaint. On May 13, 2024,
cross-complainant filed an opposition. On May 17, 2024, cross-defendants filed
a reply. 
 
LEGAL AUTHORITY
            A demurrer tests the sufficiency of
a complaint by raising questions of law. (Rodas v. Spiegel, (2001)87
Cal. App. 4th 513, 517.) In determining the merits of a demurrer, all material
facts pleaded in the complaint and those that arise by reasonable implication,
but not conclusions of fact or law, are deemed admitted by the demurring party.
(Ibid.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context. Plaintiffs need allege only “ultimate facts.” (Ludgate
Ins. Co. Ltd. v. Lockheed Martin Corp., (2000) 82 Cal. App. 4th 592, 606.)
And the absence of any allegation essential to a cause of action renders it
vulnerable to a demurrer. (McKenney v. Purepac Pharm. Co., (2008) 167
Cal. App. 4th 72, 77.)
DISCUSSION
Cross-defendants
argue that cross-complainant’s claim for breach of fiduciary duty is
inadequately pleaded because it fails to establish the essential elements: (1) existence
of a fiduciary duty, (2) breach of that duty, and (3) damages caused by the
breach. (Guitierrez v. Girardi (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 925, 932.) They
assert that no fiduciary duty exists unless a party knowingly undertakes to act
on behalf of another or enters a relationship imposing such a duty by law.
Cross
Complaint alleges:
“7. At
the time of the death of their father, each of JAY, JODI, and SATTERFIELD
received a one-third (1/3) interest as tenants in common in three parcels of
real property, including: a. 14800 S. Avalon Boulevard, Gardena, California
90248 (“14800 S. Avalon”). b. 14823 S. Avalon Boulevard, Gardena, California
90248 (“14823 S. Avalon Boulevard”). c. 850 E. 111th Place, Los Angeles,
California (“111th Place”)”  (¶ 7)
Here, the
cross-complaint alleges that the parties acquired their interests
simultaneously and through the same instrument. However, cross-defendants direct
the court to the verified Answer filed by Cross Complaint where he alleges that:
“Answering
Defendant, LP, holds a 1/3 ownership interest in 850 E 111TH PLACE PROPERTY as
tenant in common. That interest is derivative of the previous interest held by
Answering Defendant Jay Mannino, as Trustee of the Jay F. Mannino Trust.”
Cross
Defendants assert that there is no fiduciary relationship because the parties
acquired their interests via different instruments and in different years as
the cotenants for 111th Property are three separate trusts.
Specifically, Jay’s trust (JFM Trust) acquired its interest in 2009 after it
was previously transferred into the Meissner-Mannino Trust in 2004. Jodi’s
trust (JEM Trust) acquired its interest in 2022 after it was previously in the
JMN Trust in 2021. Jan’s trust (Satterfield Trust) acquired its interest in 2021.
Furthermore, under Corporations Code § 16202, joint tenancy, tenancy in common,
or part ownership does not establish a partnership or fiduciary relationship,
even if co-owners share profits from the property.
Additionally,
cross-defendants assert that the business judgment rule bars cross-complainant’s
fiduciary duty claim because the cross-complaint alleges only that Jodi and Jan
proposed a renewal of a lease at a rate below fair market value. There are no
affirmative allegations of facts establishing “fraud, bad faith, overreaching
or an unreasonable failure to investigate materials facts.” (Lee v.
Interinsurance Exchange (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 694, 715.) 
Regarding
the claim of “waste,” cross-defendants argue that cross-complainant has not
demonstrated that Jodi and Jan’s actions resulted in permanent injury to the
property. “Waste is defined as an unlawful act or omission of duty on the part
of the tenant, resulting in permanent injury to the [property].” (Old
Republic Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 128,
149 [Disproved on another ground in Vandenberg v. Superior Court (1999)
21 Cal.App.4th 815].) “Waste will be found only when the market value of
property is permanently diminished or depreciated.” (Smith v. Cap Concrete,
Inc. (1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 769, 777.) Here, cross-defendants assert that
the cross-complaint fails to allege that the lease at issue caused “permanent”
damage to the Property. 
In
opposition, cross-complainant argues that the co-tenants (Jodi and Jan) are
subject to fiduciary obligations because they acquired their interests in the
property through the same initial conveyance. He contends that co-tenants who
receive their interests at the same time, through the same deed or will, have
fiduciary duties to each other. “Where tenants in common receive their
interests at the same time, such as the same deed or will, again, a fiduciary
relationship exists.” (Wilson v. S.L. Rey, Inc. (1993) 17 Cal.App.4th
234, 243 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 552].) Cross-complainant also argues that
cross-defendants’ reliance on Corporations Code §16202 is misplaced as this
statute states that a tenancy in common does not by itself establish a
partnership, but cross-complainant clarifies that his case involves a tenancy
in common subject to fiduciary duties due to the simultaneous acquisition of
interests. Cross-complainant also asserts that the cross-complaint sufficiently
alleges that Jodi and Jan breached their fiduciary duty by leasing the property
at a rate 40% below fair market value, which deprived cross-complainant of his
fair share of the property’s value. He emphasizes that fiduciary relationships
require the highest good faith and undivided loyalty, and that cross-defendants
failed to uphold these standards.
Regarding
the business judgment rule, cross-complainant acknowledges it provides a
presumption of sound business judgment but argues that it does not apply when
there are allegations of actions taken without reasonable inquiry, with
improper motives, or conflicts of interest. Cross-complainant points out that
the cross-complaint alleges the lease renewal at a significant discount,
causing substantial financial loss, which raises factual issues about
cross-defendants’ good faith and inquiry into fair market value. These issues, cross-complainant
argues, should be determined through discovery rather than at the pleading
stage.
Lastly, cross-complainant
contends that cross-defendants’ actions constitute waste, as leasing the
property below market value permanently diminishes its market value. He refutes
cross-defendants’ claim that not renting the property would constitute waste,
asserting that the question of waste is inherently tied to the property’s
rental value and should be resolved on the merits after discovery.
In reply,
cross-defendants argue that the cross-complaint is legally flawed and should be
dismissed. First, they claim that they do not improperly rely on outside
evidence as the facts in question are cross-complainant’s own judicial
admissions in his Verified Answer, which are treated as waivers of proof and
thus not merely evidence. Second, cross-defendants’ claim that
cross-complainant’s reliance on Wilson v. S.L. Rey actually supports
cross-defendants’ argument that there is no fiduciary relationship among the
parties. Cross-defendants claim that case law establishes that each trustee
owes fiduciary duties to their respective beneficiaries, not to each other and familial
relationships alone do not create fiduciary duties. Third, even if a fiduciary
relationship were acknowledged, cross-defendants assert it is limited in scope,
and that fiduciary duties between co-tenants generally prevent acquiring
adverse titles or encumbrances, which is not alleged in this case. Here, the
cross-complaint centers on dissatisfaction with the lease price, not adverse
title acquisition. Fourth, while the business judgment rule does have
exceptions for conflicts of interest, cross-defendants argue that
cross-complainant fails to provide sufficient factual allegations to meet these
exceptions as the claims lack affirmative allegations of fraud, bad faith, or an
unreasonable failure to investigate material facts, which are necessary to
rebut the business judgment rule. Finally, regarding the waste claim,
cross-defendants argue that waste requires permanent injury to the property,
and since the property can always be rented at market rate in the future, any
current loss from below-market rent is not permanent.
The
parties cite the decision in Wilson v. S.L. Rey, Inc. (1993) 17
Cal.App.4th 234.  That case began as a
simple acquisition of three persons as tenants in common.  By the time of the case the some of the interests
had been transferred by various means to others.
“Having
established that SYA, by taking Pikush's undivided 28 percent interest, became
a tenant in common with Wilson **556 and Halprin, we now turn to the
incidents of cotenancy. Cotenants stand in fiduciary
relationship to each other. (Aaron v. Puccinelli (1953) 121 Cal.App.2d
675, 264 P.2d 152.) Thus, when a cotenant acquires an adverse outstanding title
or encumbrance, he does so as trustee for the benefit of his cotenants. (Smith
v. McNutt (1909) 156 Cal. 769, 106 P. 70.) Cotenants stand in such
confidential relation to one another in respect to the common property and the
common title that it would be inequitable to permit one, without the consent of
the others, to buy an outstanding adverse claim or title and assert it for his
exclusive benefit, and to thereby undermine the common title and injure and
prejudice the interests of his cotenants. (Ferry v. McNeil (1963) 214
Cal.App.2d 411, 29 Cal.Rptr. 577.)
Were
we to end our inquiry here, we would have to conclude that the trial court
erred. However, the facts of this case compel analysis of the *243 question
whether cotenants who acquire their interests at different times, by different
instruments, should be held as fiduciaries to one another.
Courts in
other jurisdictions have held the reason for the rule (trust) is absent when
cotenants acquire their interests at different times by different instruments,
therefore, no fiduciary relationship exists. (Turner v. Sawyer (1893)
150 U.S. 578, 586, 14 S.Ct. 192, 195, 37 L.Ed. 1189; Hodgson v. Federal Oil
& Development Co. (1927) 274 U.S. 15, 19, 47 S.Ct. 502, 503, 71 L.Ed.
901; Stevens v. Reynolds (1895) 143 Ind. 467, 41 N.E. 931; Boynton v.
Veldman (1902) 131 Mich. 555, 91 N.W. 1022; Brokaw v. Richardson
(1923) 255 S.W. 685, 687 [dicta]; Dampier v. Polk (1952) 214 Miss. 65,
58 So.2d 44, 50.) No California court has addressed this exception to the rule.
While
this is a question of first impression in California, it is not a difficult
one. It would be an elevation of form over substance to hold that a fiduciary
relationship exists between strangers merely because they have acquired
interest in the same piece of property. In the instance of a joint tenancy, by definition
a relationship of trust and confidence exists between the joint tenants. Where
tenants in common receive their interests at the same time, such as the same
deed or will, again, a fiduciary relationship exists.
But
where, as here, cotenants acquire their interests at different times through
different instruments, and no relationship of trust and confidence exists
between them, then no fiduciary relationship can be found to exist. (Stevens
v. Reynolds, supra, 41 N.E. 931; Boynton v. Veldman, supra, 91 N.W.
1022; Brokaw v. Richardson, supra, 255 S.W. at p. 687 [dicta]; Dampier
v. Polk, supra, 58 So.2d at p. 50.) This holding is consistent with an
observation made long ago by our Supreme Court in Smith v. McNutt, supra,
156 Cal. 769, 106 P. 70, that a fiduciary relationship can have no application,
absent the relationship which constitutes the whole reason for its existence.
The trial
court here specifically found no relationship of trust and confidence existed
between Wilson and Orendain, Wilson treated Orendain as a stranger, and
therefore no fiduciary relationship existed. Substantial evidence supports this
finding.”  Wilson v. S.L. Rey, Inc.
(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 234, 242–243 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 552, 555–556]
In the
case before this court, Cross Complainant alleges that the parties obtained
their initial interests “at the time of the death of their father.”  (¶ 7) 
Thus they began as fiduciaries. 
They then conveyed their interests to their respective trusts, and in
the case of Cross Complainant to his LP. 
Thus, the ownership changed in a technical sense, but the parties
remained co-owners through their trusts. 
This change in form of ownership is not of the type noted in Wilson that
should be viewed as changing the nature of the relationship of the parties.  At least at the pleading stage, the
allegations are sufficient to support a claim of the existence of a fiduciary
relationship.
            Additionally,
the cross-complaint provides sufficient details regarding the alleged breach of
fiduciary duty, including leasing the property at a rate 40% below fair market
value, which deprived the cross-complainant of his fair share of the property’s
value. (Cross-Complaint ¶¶ 10-12.)
However, it
would appear that the business judgment rule bars the fiduciary duty claim. There
are no facts which show cross-defendants took actions without reasonable
inquiry, with improper motives, and potential conflicts of interest. Cross-complainant
asserts that a lease was renewed at a rate substantially below the fair market
value, but this alone fails to raise issues about cross-defendants’ good faith
and inquiry into the fair market value. There are no affirmative allegations of
facts establishing “fraud, bad faith, overreaching or an unreasonable failure
to investigate materials facts.” (Lee v. Interinsurance Exchange (1996)
50 Cal.App.4th 694, 715.)
Given the
application of the business judgment rule, the court finds that the waste claim
cannot stand.
ORDER
            Therefore,
the Court SUSTAINS the demurrer WITH LEAVE TO AMEND as to the fiduciary duty and
waste claims. Cross Complainant is granted 20 days leave to amend.
            Moving
parties are ordered to give notice of ruling.
