[1] /         The Court observes that the Answer to
the Complaint states that it is filed for “Defendants, JAY F. MANNINO, as
trustee of the JAY F. MANNINO TRUST created u/d/t dated January 26, 2009 and
JFM FAMILY HOLDINGS LP, a Delaware limited partnership (“Answering
Defendants”)…”  Yet the Court did not see
that JFM Family Holdings LP is a party to the suit.  Also, the Answer identified the attorneys for
defendants as representing “Jay F. Mannino, an Individual and Jay F.
Mannino, as Trustee of the Jay F. Mannino Trust created u/d/t dated January 26,
2009, and JFM Family Holdings LP.” 
The Court did not see that Jay F. Mannino was sued in individual capacity.  The Court asks that these issues be clarified.
