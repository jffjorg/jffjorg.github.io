And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case. The plaintiffs, Jodi E. Mannino and Jan Satterfield, as trustees of their respective trusts, brought a verified partition complaint against defendant Jay F. Mannino, as trustee of the Jay F. Mannino Trust. The defendant cross-complained, alleging breach of fiduciary duty and waste. The plaintiffs' cross-complaint alleged that the defendants leased the property at a rate 40% below fair market value, which deprived the plaintiffs of their fair share of the property's value.

The court held that the demurrer to the cross-complaint is sustained, with leave to amend. The court found that the cross-complaint failed to allege sufficient facts to establish a fiduciary duty, as the parties acquired their interests in the property at different times and through different instruments. The court also held that the waste claim cannot stand, as the business judgment rule bars the fiduciary duty claim.

The court granted the plaintiffs 20 days to amend their cross-complaint. The moving parties are ordered to give notice of the ruling.
