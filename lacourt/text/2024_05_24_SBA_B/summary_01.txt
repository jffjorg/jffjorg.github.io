And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is based on the information presented before May 24, 2024, regarding the case number 23TRCV01477. The case involves Halimah Basheer, the plaintiff, who filed a complaint against David L Abo, Tony T Nguyen, and Dimonale Adolescent Care Facility, alleging general negligence and premises liability. The plaintiff claims that she was injured on the premises of the defendants when she slipped on a dirty, slippery and/or wet floor.

The plaintiff has filed a statement of damages and has sought to obtain a default judgment against the defendants. However, the court has noted several deficiencies in the plaintiff's submission, including the lack of evidence to support general damages, the lack of a memorandum of costs and disbursements, and the lack of evidence to support the entitlement to attorney fees.

As a result, the court has scheduled a hearing date for the plaintiff to present live testimony and documentary evidence to support the claim for a default judgment against the defendants. The court has also required the plaintiff to address the issue of attorney fees and to provide evidence to support the entitlement to recover attorney fees.
