Case No.:  23TRCV01477
ORDER ON REQUEST FOR ENTRY OF
  DEFAULT JUDGMENT
Hearing Date:  May 24, 2024




 
On May 9, 2023, plaintiff
Halimah Basheer filed a complaint against defendants David L Abo, Tony T
Nguyen, and Dimonale Adolescent Care Facility, alleging general negligence and
premises liability.  Basheer claims that:
“On or about March 14, 2023 Plaintiff
was lawfully on the premises of Defendants DAVID L ABO, an individual; TONY T
NGUYEN, an individual; DIMONDALE ADOLESCENT CARE FACILITY, unknown entity; and
DOES 1 TO 50, inclusive, located at or near 2509 W 115th Pl., Hawthorne, CA
90250. Plaintiff was walking within the subject premises when she slipped on a
dirty, slippery and/or wet floor, thereby causing Plaintiff to endure severe
injury and pain.” 
(Complaint attachment.)
On May 26, 2023, plaintiff
personally served defendant Dimonale Adolescent Care Facility the summons and
complaint and statement of damages. On July 19, 2023, plaintiff personally
served defendant Tony T. Nguyen the summons and complaint and statement of
damages. On the same date, plaintiff served by substituted service David L Abo
the summons and complaint and statement of damages.
On June 9, 2023, defendant
Dimonale Adolescent Care Facility filed an answer.
On August 22, 2023,
default was entered against Tony T. Nguyen.
On September 6, 2023, plaintiff
filed the statement of damages and default was entered against David L Abo.
On March 19, 2024 the court
ordered plaintiff to file a new default judgment on the following grounds:
1.     
No
authority or evidentiary support for attorney’s fees.
2.     
Explain
why this case is not barred by worker's compensation as it appears plaintiff
was injured in the course of her employment. 
3.     
Provide
evidence of individual liability as to defendants Tony Nguyen and David Abo. 
4.     
Submit
only one proposed default judgment as to all the defendants on JUD-100.
5.     
No
evidence of general damages.
On April 3, 2024, plaintiff
filed the following:
1.     
 Briefs in support of requests for default
judgment against David L Abo and Tony T Nguyen. 
2.     
Declarations
by plaintiff and Nina Sargsyan (plaintiff’s counsel) filed in support of requests
for default judgment against David L Abo and Tony T Nguyen. 
3.     
CIV-100
forms, request for entry of court judgment for David D Abo and Tony T Nguyen.
4.     
JUD-100
form against defendants David D Abo and Tony T Nguyen.
On April 11, 2024, there
was a notice of rejection for entry of default on the grounds that default was
already entered as to David D Abo and Tony T Nguyen.
On April 23, 2024, plaintiff
filed two separate CIV-100 forms, requesting entry of court judgment against defendants
David D Abo and Tony T Nguyen.
On May 1, 2024, the court
noted that the rejection notice filed on April 11, 2024 was in error and that
the court needed additional time to review the default judgment.
 
DISCUSSION
Code of Civil Procedure section 585 sets forth the two options for
obtaining a default judgment. First, where the plaintiff's complaint¿seeks
compensatory damages only, in a sum certain which is readily ascertainable from
the allegations of the complaint or statement of damages, the clerk may enter
the default judgment for that amount….However, if the relief requested in the complaint
is more complicated than that, consisting of either nonmonetary relief, or
monetary relief in amounts which require either an accounting, additional
evidence, or the exercise of judgment to ascertain (such as emotional distress
damages, pain and suffering, or punitive damages), the plaintiff must request
entry of judgment by the court. In such cases, the plaintiff must affirmatively
establish his entitlement to the specific judgment requested.¿  (Kim v. Westmoore Partners, Inc.
(2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, 287.)
Section 585 also allows for interest and attorney fees, where otherwise
allowed by law. (Code of Civ. Proc. 585(a).) A party seeking judgment on the
default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a brief
summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in support
of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4) a
memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought; (7) a dismissal
of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for
separate judgment under CCP Section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for attorneys’ fees if
allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (California Rules of
Court § 3.1800(a).)
The Deficiencies and Need for Live Testimony
Plaintiff claims that she is entitled to judgment against both David L.
Abo and Tony T. Nguyen in the total amount of $2,898,438.18.  This is composed of special medical damages
in the amount of $33,688.89, general damages of $1,000,000, costs of $1,467.60
and attorneys fees in the amount of $414,062.60, which is then imposed as a judgment
against each defendant thereby doubling the amounts.  (The Court notes that this amount exceeds the
amount of $2 million listed on the Statement of Damages filed August 22, 2023.)
However, the medical bills submitted to justify the claim of special
damages of $33,688.89 (times 2) only total $10,197.  This discrepancy must be adequately addressed
and explained.
Plaintiff asks the Court to award her $414,062.60 against each fo the two
individual defendants, totalling $828,125.20. 
Nothing in the submission suggests that Plaintiff is entitled to recover
attorneys fees from either defendant. 
This must be addressed with both a factual presentation and legal brief supporting
the entitlement to recover attorneys fees.
Plaintiff fails to satisfy the procedural requirements. Although plaintiff
has provided a brief summary, declarations, proposed form of judgment, plaintiff
has not provided a memorandum of costs and disbursements.
Plaintiff declares that defendants David L Abo and Tony T Nguyen are not plaintiff’s employers,
but they are the property owners of the subject premises. Plaintiff provides a
property search as an attached exhibit. (Plaintiff’s Brief, Exh.
D.) Finally, there is no
evidence to support general damages.
In light of the amounts claimed the Court shall require live testimony to
support an award to Plaintiff.
ORDER
The Court shall schedule a hearing date for Plaintiff to present live
testimony and documentary evidence to support the claim for a default judgment against
Abo and Nguyen.
