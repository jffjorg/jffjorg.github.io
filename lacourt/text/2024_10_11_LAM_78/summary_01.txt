And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled on a motion for attorney fees and costs filed by plaintiffs Justin and Amanda Webb against defendants Justin Choi and Bradley Blankenship. The plaintiffs seek reasonable compensatory legal fees and costs for work done by their counsel, Ms. Hobbs, on the case. However, the court finds that the request is excessive and that Ms. Hobbs has not sufficiently supported her legal rate of $581.75 per hour. The court awards the plaintiffs $3,000 in legal fees and costs, which is a fair and reasonable approximation of the costs incurred. The court also notes that Ms. Hobbs' agreement to accept $3,000 as the last offer is relevant to the award. The court's tentative ruling is subject to change based on any submissions or appearances by the parties at the hearing on October 11, 2024.
