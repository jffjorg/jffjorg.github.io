And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling grants Defendant David Pastor's motion to set aside the default judgment against him.

The court finds that the default judgment was caused by the attorney's mistake, and therefore, the default judgment is set aside. The motion is granted.
