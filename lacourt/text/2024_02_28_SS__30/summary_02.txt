And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the Cross-Defendant's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication as to the cross-complaint. The Cross-Defendant failed to address the causes of action for breach of contract and declaratory relief, and did not provide sufficient evidence to show that there are no triable issues of material fact. The Court also denied the Cross-Defendant's motion for summary adjudication of the affirmative defenses, as the Cross-Defendant failed to address each of the elements of the affirmative defenses and did not provide sufficient argument in support of its claims.
