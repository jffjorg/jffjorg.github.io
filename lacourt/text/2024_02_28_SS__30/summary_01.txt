And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling addresses a demurrer filed by defendant Jose Adan Alarcon Gonzalez against plaintiff Marisol Serrano et al. The court finds that the meet and confer requirement has been met. The demurrer argues that the plaintiff's cause of action is time-barred due to the statute of limitations for negligence, which is two years. However, the court concludes that the delayed discovery rule applies, and the plaintiff's cause of action did not accrue until July 25, 2019, when the plaintiff discovered her injuries. The court finds that the plaintiff's allegations regarding when she found out about her injuries are sufficient to constitute facts regarding the time and manner of discovery and her inability to have made earlier discovery despite reasonable diligence. As a result, the court overrules the demurrer and allows the plaintiff's complaint to proceed.
