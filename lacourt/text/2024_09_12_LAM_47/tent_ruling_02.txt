Entitlement to Fees
 
            Civil Code section 1717 provides, in
relevant part:
In any action on a contract, where the contract specifically
provides that attorney's fees and costs, which are incurred to
enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the parties or
to the prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be the party
prevailing on the contract, whether he or she is the party specified in the
contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees in addition to
other costs.
(Civil Code § 1717(a), bold emphasis added.) “[I]t
is established that fees, if recoverable at all – pursuant either to statute or
parties’ agreement – are available for services at trial and on appeal.”
(Morcos v. Board of Retirement (1990) 51 Cal.3d 924, 927 [emphasis in
original].) Article 17 of the contract giving rise to this dispute
categorically states that “[i]n the event of any arbitration or litigation
relating to the project, project performance or this contract, the prevailing
party shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees, costs, and expenses.”
(Cross-Defendants’ Exh. A Art. 17.1.) The Court’s interlocutory judgment,
entered May 16, 2024, expressly states that Cross-Defendants are the prevailing
parties and are entitled to their reasonable attorney’s fees. (May 16, 2024
Interlocutory Judgment.) The Court therefore finds that Cross-Defendants are
entitled to attorney’s fees. 
 
Reasonableness of Fees
 
            Reasonable
attorney’s fees are allowable costs when authorized by contract, statute, or
law. (Code Civ. Proc § 1033.5(a)(10), (c)(5)(B).) In actions that are based on
a contract, “where the contract specifically provides that attorney’s fees and
costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to
one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is determined
to be the party prevailing on the contract… shall be entitled to reasonable
attorney’s fees in addition to other costs.” (Civil Code § 1717(a) [emphasis
added].) A recovery of attorney’s fees is authorized even in noncontractual or
tort actions if the contractual provision for fee recovery is worded broadly
enough. (See Code Civ. Proc § 10211; Maynard v. BTI Group, Inc. (2013)
216 Cal.App.4th 984, 993 [agreement to award fees based on outcome of “any
dispute” encompasses all claims, “whether in contract, tort or otherwise]; Lockton
v. O'Rourke (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1051, 1076; Lerner v. Ward (1993)
13 Cal.App.4th 155, 160.) 
 
The prevailing party must file a
noticed motion to claim contractual attorney fees as costs. (Civil Code §
1717(b)(1); see Russell v. Trans Pacific Group (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th
1717, 1728.) Reasonable attorney’s fees shall be fixed by the Court, and shall
be an element of the costs of suit. (Civil Code § 1717(a); Code Civ. Proc. §
1033.5(c)(5)(B).) Reasonable attorney fees are ordinarily determined by the Court
pursuant to the “lodestar” method, i.e., the number of hours reasonably
expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate. (See PLCM Group, Inc. v.
Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095-1096; Margolin v. Regional Planning
Com. (1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004 [“California courts have consistently
held that a computation of time spent on a case and the reasonable value of
that time is fundamental to a determination of an appropriate attorneys' fee
award.”].) “[T]he lodestar is the
basic fee for comparable legal services in the community; it may be adjusted by
the court based on factors including, as relevant herein, (1) the novelty and
difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting
them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other
employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award….” 
(Ibid.) In setting the hourly rate for a fee award, courts are entitled
to consider the “fees customarily charged by that attorney and others in the
community for similar work.” (Bihun v. AT&T Info. Sys., Inc. (1993)
13 Cal.App.4th 976, 997 [affirming rate of $450 per hour], overruled on other
grounds by Lakin v. Watkins Associated Indus. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 644,
664.)  The burden is on the party seeking attorney’s fees to prove the
reasonableness of the fees. (Center for Biological Diversity v. County of
San Bernardino (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 603, 615.) 
 
The
Court has broad discretion in determining the amount of a reasonable attorney’s
fee award, which will not be overturned absent a “manifest abuse of discretion,
a prejudicial error of law, or necessary findings not supported by substantial
evidence.” (Bernardi v. County of Monterey (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th
1379, 1393-1394.)  The Court need not explain its calculation of the
amount of attorney’s fees awarded in detail; identifying the factors considered
in arriving at the amount will suffice. (Ventura v. ABM Indus. Inc.
(2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 258, 274-275.)
 
Here,
Cross-Defendants request attorney’s fees in the amount of $47,402.50. This
amount is derived from $37,802.50 in attorney’s fees actually billed in
connection with this action, plus $9,600 in anticipated fees relating to this
motion. The itemized billing records provided by Cross-Defendant’s counsel
indicate that 27.4 hours of attorney time were incurred at $550 per hour, and
76.9 hours of attorney time were incurred at $600 per hour. (Cross-Defendants’
Exh. D.) The Declaration of Cross-Defendants’ counsel, Kenneth G. Ruttenberg,
states that his office charged Cross-Defendants $550 per hour through the end
of November 2023, and thereafter billed $600 per hour. (Declaration of Kenneth
G. Ruttenberg ISO Mot. ¶ 17.) 102.1 of those hours were billed by Attorney
Ruttenberg, who describes his training, experience, and hourly rate. (Id.
¶¶ 2, 17.) Those same records indicate that 2.1 hours of attorney time at $600
per hour were billed by Attorney Mark A. O’Brien in connection with
Cross-Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment. (See Exh. D.) While Attorney
Ruttenberg’s declaration notes Attorney O’Brien’s contribution, it does not
account for his training, skills, or experience so as to demonstrate that his
fees were reasonable. That said, Attorney Ruttenberg notes that the bulk of his
firm’s billing entries pertain to the motion for summary judgment and summary
adjudication, which sought to adjudicate both the First Amended Cross-Complaint
and the first cause of action in the First Amended Complaint. (Ruttenberg Decl.
¶ 18.) Attorney Ruttenberg estimates that approximately one-half of the time
spent on the motion is attributable to the First Amended Complaint, and
therefore deducted $23,407.50—i.e., half the fees incurred on that motion—from
the billing request on this motion. (Id.) Upon review of the itemized
records, the Court finds that the remaining request is reasonable as to the
fees actually incurred prior to this motion, with the exception of the fees
incurred by Attorney O’Brien. As Cross-Defendants have not accounted for Attorney
O’Brien’s skills, training, or experience, the Court finds that this portion of
the fee request should be reduced by $630, reflecting the remaining portion of
his fees not captured by the deduction already applied. 
 
Attorney
Ruttenberg also states that he has incurred 11 hours of attorney time on this
motion and anticipates another 5 hours on the reply brief and the hearing on
this motion. (Ruttenberg Decl. ¶ 20.) To that end, Cross-Defendants request
another $9,600 in attorney’s fees. The Court finds this request, which seeks
compensation for 16 hours of attorney time on an unopposed and straightforward
fee motion, to be unreasonably inflated. The Court will therefore reduce this
request to $2,400, equivalent to 4 hours of attorney time at $600 per hour. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
Cross-Defendants’ Motion for Attorney’s Fees is GRANTED in the amount of $39,572.50.
 
            Moving
Parties to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
