Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted Cross-Defendants' Motion for Attorney's Fees in the amount of $39,572.50. The Court found that Cross-Defendants are entitled to attorney's fees as the prevailing parties on the First Amended Cross-Complaint. The Court considered the reasonableness of the fees requested and reduced the request by $630 for fees incurred by Attorney O'Brien, as the Court did not have sufficient information about his skills, training, and experience. The Court also reduced the request by $7,900 for fees incurred on the motion, finding that the request was unreasonably inflated. The Court awarded attorney's fees in the amount of $2,400 for fees incurred on the reply brief and the hearing on the motion.
