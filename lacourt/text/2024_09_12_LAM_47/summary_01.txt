```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted in part and denied in part the plaintiff's motion for leave to augment her expert witness list. The plaintiff seeks to add two new experts: Edwond A. Provder, a life care planner and vocational expert, and Lawrence H. Jacobson, an expert on the legal standard of care. The judge has denied the request to add Provder because it is too late and there is no justification for the addition. However, the judge has granted the request to add Jacobson because the original expert, Gregory Fayard, is unavailable to testify at trial due to a scheduling conflict. The judge has also criticized the plaintiff's counsel for failing to provide credible evidence that they attempted to meet and confer with the defendant's counsel before filing the motion.
