And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling is regarding the demurrer filed by the defendants, Kaiser Foundation Hospitals and Southern California Permanente Medical Center, to the complaint filed by the plaintiffs, Desiree Montserrat Rodriguez Chavez, Jennifer Sofia Rodriguez Chavez, Sergio Jonathan Steve Rodriguez Chavez, and Adriana Leticia Chavez Haro. The demurrer alleged that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.

The court found that the defendants failed to demonstrate how the distinction between professional and ordinary negligence is material to the plaintiffs' ability to state a claim for wrongful death and survival based on negligence. The court also found that the complaint adequately alleges that the plaintiffs, Chavez Haro and Jennifer Rodriguez Chavez, were contemporaneously aware that the defendants' alleged failure to properly medicate Sergio Rodriguez Jimenez was the cause of his suicide.

Accordingly, the court overruled the demurrer in its entirety and ordered the defendants to file an answer in ten days.
