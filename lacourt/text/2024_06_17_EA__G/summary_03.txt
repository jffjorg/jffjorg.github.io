And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies Christopher Michael Walker's motion to set aside the judgment and any default, and to quash any writ of possession/execution. The court finds that Walker failed to provide proof of service that establishes Rushing was timely served with copies of the present motion as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1005. As a result, the court lacks jurisdiction to rule on the motion and denies it without prejudice.
