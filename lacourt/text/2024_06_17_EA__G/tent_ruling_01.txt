BACKGROUND
This
is a breach of contract action. In April 2022, Plaintiff Jaime Adolfo De La
Vega entered into a written agreement with Defendant Mynor Rolando Mejia
Hernandez in which Mejia Hernandez agreed to remodel a property in Pomona in
exchange for estimated labor and material costs of $89,500. After Mejia
Hernandez commenced work on the Pomona property in May 2022, De La Vega agreed
to pay an additional $15,000 in August 2022 after Mejia Hernandez claimed
additional funds would be needed to complete the project. In January 2023, De
La Vega asked Mejia Hernandez to stop work on the Pomona property and sought
out the services of another contractor. De La Vega alleges that only half of
the work had been completed at this time and that twenty percent of the
completed work was unsatisfactory.
On September
21, 2023, De La Vega filed a complaint against Mejia Hernandez and Does 1-10 alleging
the following causes of action: (1) breach of contract, (2) breach of implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing, (3) breach of implied warranty, and (4)
negligence. On October 30, 2023, De La Vega’s process server served Mejia
Hernandez with substitute service in Apple Valley.
On February
8, 2024, the Court entered default against Mejia Hernandez after Mejia
Hernandez failed to file a timely answer. On May 1, 2024, De La Vega submitted
the present application for default judgment.
An
OSC Re: Default Judgment is set for June 17, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)

La Vega seeks default judgment against Mejia Hernandez in the total amount of $217,806.22,
including $199,229.37 in damages, $12,117.51 in interest, $3,930.00 in attorney
fees, and $2,529.34 in costs.¿For the following reasons, the Court CONTINUES
the hearing on De La Vega’s
application.

application, De La Vega’s declaration relies on exhibits that appear to have
portions in Spanish without an English translation including Exhibits A, D, and
G. Pursuant to Rule 3.110, subdivision (g) of the California Rules of Court, “[e]xhibits
written in a foreign language must be accompanied by an English translation,
certified under oath by a qualified interpreter.” Accordingly, De La Vega’s declaration must be resubmitted with the

determined at the hearing set in Department G (Pomona). De La Vega is
further ordered to resubmit De La Vega’s supporting declaration with proper
translations for foreign language exhibits pursuant to Rule 3.110, subdivision
(g) of the California Rules of Court.
