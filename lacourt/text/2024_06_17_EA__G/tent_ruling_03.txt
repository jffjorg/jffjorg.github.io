Aside the Judgment and Any Default, and To Quash Any Writ of
Possession/Execution
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Defendant Christopher Michael Walker’s Motion to Set
Aside the Judgment and Any Default, and To Quash Any Writ of
Possession/Execution is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
BACKGROUND
This
is an action on a previous judgment. In February 2013, Bertha Merza brought a
collections action in this Court against Michelle Darlene Walker, Christopher
Walker, and Norwalk Driving School. In October 2013, Merza obtained a default
judgment against the Walkers in the amount of $60,430.00. In August 2013, Merza
assigned the judgment to Plaintiff Jean-Pierre Rushing, doing business as
Interwest Judgment Recovery.
On December
7, 2023, Rushing filed a complaint against the Walkers on the October 2013
judgment. On December 13, 2023, Rushing’s process server personally served
Michelle Walker in West Covina. On the same day, Rushing’s process server
personally served Christopher Walker in Eastvale.
On January
30, 2024, the Court entered default against Christopher Walker after Christopher
Walker failed to timely file an answer.
On May
29, 2024, Christopher Walker filed the present motion. A hearing on the present
motion, case management conference, and OSC Re: Sanctions are set for June 17,
2024.
ANALYSIS
Christopher
Walker seeks to set aside the entry of default on the grounds of mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. For the following reasons, the Court
DENIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE the motion.
Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 1005, subdivisions (a)(10) and (b), a motion
and its supporting papers must be filed and served at least sixteen court days before
the hearing date with an additional five days required if the mailing address
is within the State of California. Here, Christopher Walker failed to
provide a proof of service that establishes Rushing was timely served with copies
of the present motion as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1005.
Because “the court lacks jurisdiction to rule on a motion that has not been
properly noticed for hearing on the date in question,” Christopher Walker’s
motion is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE. (Diaz v. Professional Community Management, Inc. (2017) 16
Cal.App.5th 1190, 1204-1205.)
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Christopher Walker’s motion to set
aside default is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
