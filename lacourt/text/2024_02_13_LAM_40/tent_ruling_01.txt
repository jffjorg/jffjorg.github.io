Bustos Auto Body (his former employer), Fabricio Busto (Bustos Auto Body’s

erroneously sued as Fabrico Raul Bustos), and Does 1 through 20 pursuant a July

(2) Failure to Pay All Wages Owed, (3) Failure to Pay All Minimum Wages Owed,
(4) Failure to Provie All Required Rest Periods, (5) Failure to Provide All

Motion Before the Court
On June 28, 2023, Plaintiff’s
counsel served a notice of deposition on Defendant Busto’s counsel, with the
deposition to take place on July 27, 2023. The deposition notice was served on
Eliel Chemerinski, whom the Court relieved of representation on March 30, 2023,
and on Defendant Busto at his 1345 San Fernando Road, San Fernando, CA 91340
business address.
Between July 20 and 26, 2023,
Plaintiff’s counsel emailed Defendant Busto at the email provided by Eliel
Chemerinsky. Defendant Busto did not respond to those communications.
On July 27, 2023, Defendant Busto
called Plaintiff’s counsel’s office and the parties discussed the deposition,
some material issues in this action, the credibility of Defendant Busto’s
representations, and Defendant Busto’s desire for service at a different email
address and a different physical address but failure to provide more than a
telephone number. Plaintiff’s counsel thereafter texted Defendant Busto, noting
a failure to produce discovery.
On October 4, 2023, Plaintiff’s
counsel filed a motion to compel the deposition of Defendant Busto. Defendant
Busto failed to oppose the motion, which the Court granted on November 3, 2023
at a hearing at which Defendants made no appearance. Plaintiff Busto was
ordered to submit himself for deposition by November 15, 2023 and to pay
$2,061.65 in sanctions within 30 days of the ruling.
On November 8, 2023, the Court held
a status conference at which Defendant Busto failed to appear, leading the
Court to order sanctions against Busto pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 177.5.
On December 21, 2023, Plaintiff
filed a motion to strike Defendant Busto’s Answer or, in the alternative, that
the Court enter additional sanctions, monetary or otherwise, against Defendant
Busto for acting in contempt of Court orders in willfully refusing to attend
his properly noticed deposition and failure to pay Court ordered monetary
sanctions to Plaintiff. The motion also seeks reasonable costs and attorneys’
fees in connection with Defendant Busto’s failure to attend and participate in
the deposition.
The motion was mailed to Defendants
Busto and Bustos Auto Body on December 21, 2023 and emailed to these Defendants
to the same email address on December 22, 2023. (See Notice of Errata filed January
4, 2024.)
On January 3, 2024, the Court held
an order to show cause (OSC) hearing at which Defendant Busto failed to appear.
Plaintiff’s counsel represented that Defendant Busto did not intend to
participate in this case and that Plaintiff had filed a motion to enter default
as to Defendant Busto, i.e., the December 21st motion. The Court also granted
additional sanctions against Defendant Busto pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 177.5.
Defendant Busto failed to oppose
Plaintiff’s motion, which is now before the Court.
 
Motion for Terminating Sanctions
Legal
Standard
Terminating
sanctions are drastic sanctions that should be imposed sparingly and only when
it is clear that the party to be sanctioned has left no viable alternatives.
(See Dept. of Forestry & Fire. Prot. v. Howell (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th
154, 191, disapproved on other grounds in Presbyterian Camp & Conf.
Ctrs, Inc. v. Superior Court (2021) 12 Cal.5th 493; Lopez v. Watchtower
Bible & Tract Soc’y (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566, 604.)
The
court should consider the totality of the circumstances before ordering
terminating sanctions, including (1) whether the conduct of the party was
willful, (2) the detriment to the party propounding discovery, and (3) the
number of formal and informal attempt to obtain the discovery. (Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390.) The Court is
not required to find that a party acted in bad faith before imposing
terminating sanctions. (See Creed-21 v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18
Cal.App.5th 690, 703.)
If
terminating sanctions are warranted, the Court may make:
(1)
An order striking all or parts of the pleadings (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030,
subd. (d)(1); Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967,
992; Van Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1519 [trial
court struck defendant’s answer]);
(2)
An order staying proceedings until a party obeys a discovery order (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d)(2); Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc., supra,
174 Cal.App.4th at p. 992);
(3)
An order dismissing all or part of a party’s action (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.030, subd. (d)(3); Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc., supra,
174 Cal.App.4th at p. 992; see, e.g., Crawford v. JPMorgan Chase Bank
(2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1265, 1271 [dismissal proper when party threatened to
use pepper spray and taser on opposing counsel at deposition and was openly
contemptuous of trial court]); and
(4)
An order rendering a default judgment against a party (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.030, subd. (d)(4); Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc., supra,
174 Cal.App.4th at p. 992; see, e.g., Electronic Funds Solutions, LLC v.
Murphy (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1183-1184 [defendant’s pervasive and
consistent misuse of discovery process supported court’s dismissal of answer
and entry of default judgment]; but see Nickell v. Matlock (2012) 206
Cal.App.4th 934, 943-944 [Code Civ. Proc., § 764.010 prohibits court from rendering
judgment by default as discovery sanction in quiet title actions]).
Order
Granting Terminating and Monetary Sanctions: GRANTED.
Here,
the Court finds that sufficient grounds exist to strike Defendant Busto’s
Answer.
As
argued by Plaintiff, Defendant Busto’s conduct in failing to 1) respond to
communications, 2) attend his deposition and 3) pay sanctions appears willful:
“Here, there is no argument of either because Defendant did not comply with the
Court order to attend his deposition, or at least properly meet and confer to
establish an alternative date. Defendant also failed to pay the Court ordered
monetary sanctions to Plaintiff, and presumably also to the Court. Failure to
comply arose out of Defendant’s deliberate choice to not comply, which he
outrightly stated when speaking with Plaintiff’s counsel. (Mot., p. 8; see Mot.,
Danelon Decl., ¶¶ 13-14 [“During my call on November 9, 2023, I advised
Defendant that he would need to attend his deposition on November 15, 2023 or at
least provide me an alternative date for his deposition to be taken. Defendant
became defiant and rude, including cursing, and told me that he would not
attend his deposition on November 15, 2023 or any other date. [¶] I then
advised Defendant that the Court had also ordered him to pay monetary sanctions
to Plaintiff on November 3, 2023 …. … Defendant again became crass and again
explicitly stated that he would not pay monetary sanction to Plaintiff or the
Court at any point. As of this date, the monetary sanctions have not been paid
to Plaintiff. [¶] …. Defendant said … he did not care [whether Plaintiff filed
a motion to strike his answer for failure to comply with this Court’s order]
and that he [Busto] would not comply with any court order.”]; see also Mot.,
Danelon Decl., ¶ 8, Ex. E [phone log showing call from Defendant Busto].)
There
is a clear detriment here to the propounding party, Plaintiff Jose Garcia, who
is unable to conduct discovery and depose Defendant Busto prior to trial in
this action, particularly where a deposition was first noticed in June 2023.
Last,
Plaintiff shows sufficient follow-ups with and outright refusals to comply from
Defendant Busto. (Mot., Danelon Decl., ¶¶ 8-16.)
The
Court thus GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion, STRIKES Defendant Busto’s Answer, and
ENTERS DEFAULT against Defendant Busto, a conclusion reinforced by the outright
refusal of Defendant Busto to comply with his Court’s orders and the lack of
viable alternatives to ensure Defendant Busto’s compliance with the Discovery
Act and this Court’s orders. (See, e.g., 11/8/23 and 1/3/24 Minutes [imposing
monetary sanctions on Defendant Busto for failure to appear]; Dept. of
Forestry & Fire. Prot. v. Howell, supra, 18 Cal.App.5th at p. 191.)
The
Court also GRANTS the request for sanctions in the amount of $2,923.45, which
is comprised of reasonable costs of $61.65 and $861.60, a reasonable fee rate
of $500 per hour, and four hours expended by counsel or to be expended by
counsel in connection with this motion, including making an appearance at this
hearing. (Mot., p. 11; Mot., Danelon Decl., ¶ 22.)
 

Conclusion
Plaintiff Jose Garcia’s Motion to
Strike Answer of Defendant Fabricio Busto; or in the Alternative, Enter
Additional Sanctions for Contempt and Failure to Comply with Court Order is
GRANTED.
Plaintiff may proceed by way of entering
default and default judgment.
Defendant Fabricio Raul Busto’s
(sued as Fabrico Raul Bustos) July 28, 2022 Answer to Complaint is STRICKEN. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d)(1); Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc., supra,
174 Cal.App.4th at p. 992; Van Sickle v. Gilbert, supra, 196
Cal.App.4th at p. 1519.)
The Court ENTERS DEFAULT against
Defendant Fabricio Raul Busto (sued as Fabrico Raul Bustos). (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2023.030, subd. (d)(4); Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc., supra,
174 Cal.App.4th at p. 992; Electronic Funds Solutions, LLC v. Murphy, supra,
134 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1183-1184.)
Plaintiff Jose Garcia’s request for
reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees is also GRANTED in the amount of
$2,923.45.
Defendant Fabricio Raul Busto (sued
as Fabrico Raul Bustos) is ORDERED to remit payment of these sanctions to
Plaintiff Jose Garcia within 21 days of notice of this order.
Defendant Fabricio Raul Busto (sued
as Fabrico Raul Bustos) is further ORDERED to remit the monetary sanctions
ordered in this Court’s November 3, 2023 order to Plaintiff Jose Garcia within
21 days of this ruling. (Code Civ. Proc., § 128, subd. (a)(4) [courts shall
have the power to compel obedience to its orders].)
