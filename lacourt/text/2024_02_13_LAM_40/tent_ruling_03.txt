 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Defendants Virgin
  Galactic, LLC and Galactic Co., LLC’s Motion to Compel Arbitration.



 
Background
Plaintiff David Grylls sued Defendants Virgin Galactic, LLC (VG),
Galactic Co., LLC (Galactic), and Does 1 through 10 pursuant to an October 10,
2023 Complaint alleging claims of (1) Wrongful Termination in Violation of
Public Policy, (2) Discrimination in Violation of Government Code Section
12940(a), (3) Retaliation for Harassment and/or Discrimination Complaints in
Violation of Government Code Section 12940(h), (4) Failure to Prevent in
Violation of Government Code Section 12940(k), (5) Failure to Provide CFRA
Leave in Violation of Government Code 12945.2(k), (6) Retaliation for Using
CFRA Leave in Violation of Government Code Section 12945.2(q), (7) Failure to
Pay Overtime in Violation Sections 510, 1194, 1998, (8) Failure to Authorize
and Permit Meal Breaks in Violation of Labor Code Sections 226.7 and 512, (9)
Failure to Provide Accurate Wage Statements in Violation of Labor Code Section
226(a), and (10) Failure to Pay Wages of Owed Timely in Violation of Labor Code
Sections 201 to 203.
On November 20, 2023, the Court related this matter with 23STCV27067, a
case between the same parties for PAGA claims only.
On January 18, 2024, Defendants VG
and Galactic filed a motion to compel arbitration in this action. According to
a proof of service, the motion was personally served on Plaintiff’s counsel at
the address appearing on the Complaint’s caption page.
Plaintiff Grylls has failed to
oppose the motion to compel arbitration despite, most recently, filing a case
management conference statement on January 30, 2024. That statement fails to
address Defendants VG and Galactic’s January 29, 2024 case management
conference statement’s reference to the motion to compel arbitration and its
hearing on February 13, 2024.
Defendants VG and Galactic’s motion
to compel arbitration is now before the Court.
 
Motion
to Compel Arbitration
Legal Standard 
The Federal Arbitration Act
(“FAA”), while a federal statute, applies in California courts and requires
state courts to enforce arbitration agreements as required by the federal
common law developed under the FAA. (See Southland Corp. v. Keating
(1984) 465 U.S. 1, 15-16; Broughton v. Cigna Healthplans (1999) 21
Cal.4th 1066, 1074-78, superseded by statute on another ground as stated in Ferguson
v. Corinthian Colleges, Inc. (9th Cir. 2013) 733 F.3d 928, 937.).) The FAA
preempts and invalidates state law and state judicial decisions that disfavor
arbitration or require arbitration provisions to pass higher scrutiny. (Southland
Corp. v. Keating, supra, at p. 12; Perry v. Thomas (1987) 482
U.S. 483, 490.) If the parties designate the FAA applies, then California
arbitration law is preempted. (See, e.g., Rodriguez v. American Techs., Inc.
(2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1121-1122.) However, courts have found that
where the FAA is found not to apply, the California Arbitration Act (Code Civ.
Proc. § 1280 et seq.) applies. (See Valencia v. Smyth (2010) 185
Cal.App.4th 153, 178.)
 A court’s inquiry is limited
to a determination of (1) whether a valid arbitration agreement exists and (2)
whether the arbitration agreement covers the dispute. (9 U.S.C. § 4; Chiron
Corp. v. Ortho Diagnostics Systems, Inc. (9th Cir. 2000) 207 F.3d 1126,
1130; Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. (2002) 537 U.S. 79, 84; see Simula,
Inc. v. Autoliv, Inc. (9th Cir. 1999) 175 F.3d 716, 720 [if the finding is
affirmative on both counts the FAA requires the Court to enforce the
arbitration agreement in accordance with its terms].) “An order to arbitrate
the particular grievance should not be denied unless it may be said with
positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an
interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.” (United Steelworkers of
America v. Warrior & Gulf Navigation Co. (1960) 363 U.S. 574,
582-583.) 
 Moreover, the general rule is
that the FAA governs all agreements to arbitrate in contracts “involving
interstate commerce.” (Higgins v. Superior Court (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th
1238, 1247.) The term “involving” commerce “is broad and is indeed the
functional equivalent of “affecting’ commerce.” (Allied-Bruce Terminix
Companies, Inc. v. Dobson (1995) 513 U.S. 265, 273-274.) The U.S. Supreme
Court has held that this broad interpretation includes employment contracts.
(See Circuit City Stores v. Adams (2001) 532 U.S. 105, 106.) The
defendant bears the burden of proving applicability of the FAA by showing that
its activities constitute interstate commerce. (Hoover v. Am. Income Life
Ins. Co. (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 1193, 1207.) Failure to demonstrate that
the employment agreement affects interstate commerce renders the FAA
inapplicable. (See Lane v. Francis Capital Management LLC (2014) 224
Cal.App.4th 676, 687-688; Woolls v. Superior Court (2005) 127
Cal.App.4th 197, 212.)
Even where the FAA governs the
interpretation of arbitration clauses, California law governs whether an
arbitration agreement has been formed in the first instance. (Baker v.
Osborne Development Corp. (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 884, 893.) 
 The party seeking arbitration
has the “burden of proving the existence of a valid arbitration agreement by a
preponderance of the evidence.” (Ruiz v. Moss Bros. Auto Group, Inc.
(2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 836, 842.) “Once that burden is satisfied, the party
opposing arbitration must prove by a preponderance of the evidence any defense
to the petition.” (Lacayo v. Cataline Restaurant Group Inc. (2019) 38
Cal.App.5th 244, 257.) “The trial court sits as the trier of fact, weighing all
the affidavits, declarations, and other documentary evidence, and any oral
testimony the court may receive at its discretion, to reach a final
determination.” (Ruiz v. Moss Bros. Auto Group, Inc., supra, at
p. 842.) 
On a petition to compel
arbitration, the court must grant the petition unless it finds (1) no written
agreement to arbitrate exists, (2) the right to compel arbitration has been
waived, (3) grounds exist for revocation of the agreement, or (4) litigation is
pending that may render the arbitration unnecessary or create conflicting
rulings on common issues. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2; see Condee v. Longwood
Management Corp. (2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 215, 218-219.)
In determining the enforceability
of an arbitration agreement, the court considers “two ‘gateway issues’ of
arbitrability: (1) whether there was an agreement to arbitrate between the
parties, and (2) whether the agreement covered the dispute at issue.” (Omar
v. Ralphs Grocery Co. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 955, 961.) If these issues are
satisfied in favor of the movant, (3) the party opposing arbitration must prove
by a preponderance of the evidence any defense to the petition. (Lacayo v.
Cataline Restaurant Group Inc., supra, 38 Cal.App.5th at p. 257.)
Order Compelling Arbitration:
GRANTED.
I.
Whether Arbitration Agreement
Exists
“Parties are not required to
arbitrate their disagreements unless they have agreed to do so. [Citation.] A
contract to arbitrate will not be inferred absent a ‘clear agreement.’
[Citation.] When determining whether a valid contract to arbitrate exists, we
apply ordinary state law principles that govern contract formation. [Citation]
In California, a ‘clear agreement’ to arbitrate may be either express or
implied in fact. [Citation.]” (Davis v. Nordstrom, Inc. (9th Cir. 2014)
755 F.3d 1089, 1092-93 [applying California law].) The court is only required
to make a finding of the agreement’s existence, not an evidentiary
determination of its validity. (Condee v. Longwood Management Corp., supra,
88 Cal.App.4th at p. 219.)
Here, Defendants attach a copy of
an electronic arbitration agreement purportedly executed by Defendant Grylls.
(Mot., pp. 7-9; see Mot., Witte Decl., Exs. B [acceptance of employment], D
[electronic arbitration agreement], E [other onboarding documents executed by
Plaintiff].) Defendants attach a declaration from Joy Witte, People Generalist
for Galactic since November 2020, which explains the records showing the
November 9, 2020 hiring of Plaintiff Grylls and the onboarding process for new
employees, including the process by which Plaintiff signed an arbitration
agreement and other documents as a condition of employment. (See Mot., Witte
Decl., ¶¶ 1-13, Exs. B, D, E; Complaint, ¶ 16 [termination on July 11, 2023].) 
No opposition or reply/notice of
non-opposition appear in the record.
The Court finds in favor of
Defendants.
The Court first determines that the
Witte declaration meets the requirements established in Espejo v. Southern
California Permanente Medical Group (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 1047, 1062 and Ruiz
v. Moss Bros. Auto Group, Inc., supra, 232 Cal.App.4th at p. 844.
The Court next determines that an
arbitration agreement executed by the parties sufficiently carries Defendants’
burden as to this issue. (Mot., Witte Decl., Ex. D; see Gamboa v. Northeast
Community Clinic (2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 158, 164-165 [the moving party bears
the initial burden of producing prima facie evidence of a written agreement to
arbitrate the controversy, which can be met by the moving party by attaching a
copy of the arbitration agreement purporting to bear the opposing party’s
signature].)
Accordingly, the Court determines that
an agreement to arbitrate exists between the parties.
II.
Scope of the Arbitration
Agreement
“[T]he decision as to whether a
contractual arbitration clause covers a particular dispute rests substantially
on whether the clause in question is ‘broad’ or ‘narrow.’” (Bono v. David
(2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 1055, 1067.) “‘A “broad” clause includes those using
language such as “any claim arising from or related to this agreement”‘
[Citation] or ‘arising in connection with the [a]greement’ [Citation.]” (Rice
v. Downs (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 175, 186 [italics omitted].) “But clauses
requiring arbitration of a claim, dispute, or controversy ‘arising from’ or ‘arising
out of’ an agreement, i.e., excluding language such as ‘relating to this
agreement’ or ‘in connection with this agreement,’ are ‘generally considered to
be more limited in scope than would be, for example, a clause agreeing to
arbitrate “‘any controversy … arising out of or relating to this agreement[.]’”
[Citations.]” (Id. at p. 186-87 [italics omitted].) “Several Ninth
Circuit cases have held that agreements requiring arbitration of ‘any dispute,’
‘controversy,’ or ‘claim’ ‘arising under’ or ‘arising out of’ the agreement are
intended to encompass only disputes relating to the interpretation and
performance of the agreement.” (Id. at p. 187.)
Defendants argue that the
arbitration agreement encompasses all the FEHA, CFRA, Labor Code, and wrongful
termination claims because those types of claims are within the scope of the
parties’ arbitration agreement. (Mot., pp. 10-12, citing Mot., Witte Decl., Ex.
D, ¶ 2.)
No opposition or reply/notice of
non-opposition appear in the record.
The Court finds in favor of
Defendants.
The parties’ agreement provides: “Employer
and Employee hereby agree that the sole and exclusive means to resolve any and
all claims or controversies between them, or between Employee and any
present or former officer, director, agent, or employee of Employer, relating in any manner to the employment or termination
of employment of Employee, shall be by final and binding arbitration under the
auspices of the American Arbitration Association (‘AAA’). The Parties
agree that any claim, dispute, and/or controversy that Employee may have
against Employer (or its owners, directors, officers, managers, employees, or
agents), or Employer may have against Employee, shall be submitted to and
determined exclusively by binding arbitration under the Federal Arbitration
Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1 et seq. (“FAA”), in conformity with the procedures of the
American Arbitration Association’s Employment Arbitration Rules & Mediation
Procedures (‘the AAA Rules’).” (Mot., Witte Decl., Ex. D, ¶ 2.)
The FEHA, CFRA, Labor Code, and
wrongful termination claims clearly “relat[e] in [some] manner to the
employment or termination of employment of [Plaintiff Grylls from employment
with Defendants],” with the parties agreeing to “final and binding arbitration
under the auspices of the American Arbitration Association” as to these claims.
(Mot., Witte Decl., Ex. D, ¶ 2.)
Accordingly, the Court determines
that the agreement to arbitrate between the parties encompasses the claims
alleged in the Complaint.
III.
Interstate Commerce
A motion to compel arbitration
based on the FAA must show not only that that the employer engaged in
interstate commerce but also that “the employment relationship involved
interstate commerce.” (Lane v. Francis Capital Management LLC, supra,
224 Cal.App.4th at pp. 687-688.) Courts have found that where the FAA is found
not to apply, the California Arbitration Act (Code Civ. Proc. § 1280 et seq.)
applies. (See Valencia v. Smyth, supra, 185 Cal.App.4th at p.
178.)
Defendants argue that the parties’
arbitration agreement provides that “[t]he FAA applies to th[e] Agreement
because [Defendants’] business involves interstate commerce.” (Mot., p. 10,
citing Mot., Witte Decl., Ex. D, ¶¶ 2, 12.)
No opposition or reply/notice of
non-opposition appear in the record.
The Court finds in favor of
Defendants.
Here, either the agreement provides
grounds for finding interstate commerce is involved (Mot., Witte Decl., Ex. D,
¶¶ 2, 12), or the Court can enforce the arbitration agreement pursuant to California
law (Valencia v. Smyth, supra, 185 Cal.App.4th at p. 178).
The Court thus determines that
Defendants have carried their burden in moving for an order compelling
arbitration of Plaintiff’s claims.
IV.
Defenses to the Arbitration
Agreement
A “party opposing arbitration must
prove by a preponderance of the evidence any defense to the petition” to compel
arbitration in the matter. (Lacayo v. Cataline Restaurant Group Inc., supra,
38 Cal.App.5th at p. 257.)
Here, because no opposition was
filed in response to Defendants VG and Galactic’s motion despite service of
this motion on the same address listed in Plaintiff’s Complaint’s caption page
(compare Mot., Proof of Service, with Complaint, p. 1), Plaintiff fails to
carry his burden to show valid defenses to enforcement of the parties’
arbitration agreement.
Defendants’ motion is thus GRANTED.
V.
Dismissal or Stay of Action
“If a court of competent
jurisdiction, whether in this State or not, has ordered arbitration of a
controversy which is an issue involved in an action or proceeding pending
before a court of this State, the court in which such action or proceeding is
pending shall, upon motion of a party to such action or proceeding, stay the
action or proceeding until an arbitration is had in accordance with the order
to arbitrate or until such earlier time as the court specifies.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1281.4; see also 9 U.S. Code, § 3 [similar].)
Defendants request a stay of this
action pending resolution of the arbitration proceedings. (Mot., pp. 19-20.)
No opposition or reply/notice of
non-opposition appear in the record.
The Court finds in favor of
Defendants.
The Court ORDERS this action STAYED
until an arbitration is had in accordance with this order or until such earlier
time as the Court specifies.
Defendants also seek an order to
stay the related case, LASC Action No. 23STCV27067, a PAGA case, “pending resolution
of this motion.” (Memo. at pp. 19:23 – 20:6.) As a practical matter, that action
has been effectively so stayed, and Defendants have not requested that the
other matter be stayed after the motion’s resolution. In any event, that PAGA action
would presumably be adjudicated in accordance with Adolph v. Uber Technologies,
Inc. (2023) 14 Cal.5th 1104, 1123-1124.
VI.
Attorney Fees and Costs
            In their
Motion and in the introduction of the Memorandum of Points and Authorities,
Defemdants “seek to recover costs and fees associated with bringing said motion
to compel, pursuant to Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §§ 128.5 and 128.7.” (Notice of
Motion at p. 2:17-18; Memo. at p. 7:13-14.) Nothing more is said about fees or
costs in the motion or the memorandum. Nor are fees or costs set forth in either
of the declarations filed in support of the motion. (See Joy Witte, Jamie Lee
Declarations). Accordingly, the Court has no support for such request nor even
a requested number, and denies the request. 
Conclusion
Defendants Virgin Galactic, LLC and
Galactic Co., LLC’s Motion to Compel Arbitration is GRANTED.
The Court ORDERS this action STAYED
until an arbitration is had in accordance with this order or until such earlier
time as the Court specifies.
However, the Court declines to
order any arbitration or further stay in relation to LASC Action No.
23STCV27067.
