And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in favor of Plaintiff Janet Weiss's motion to compel inspection of the Baravarian Condo. The motion was filed in response to Defendant Nurbeh Baravarian's refusal to permit Plaintiff Weiss to access the bathroom in the Baravarian Condo to effect repairs to a leaking water pipe located between the two condos. The Judge found that an inspection of the Baravarian Condo is necessary to establish the issues in the case and to determine whether Defendant Baravarian's claims of damages to the Baravarian Condo are legitimate.

The Judge rejected Defendant Baravarian's arguments that photographs are sufficient and that an inspection is not necessary. The Judge also found that any right to privacy held by Defendant Baravarian is overcome by the compelling interest in an inspection of the Baravarian Condo.

The Judge ordered Defendant Baravarian to permit an inspection of the Baravarian Condo within 30 days of the ruling. The Judge also denied Plaintiff Weiss's request for sanctions against Defendant Baravarian, finding that sanctions would be unjust.
