And here is the summary in English text:

The Court's tentative ruling grants Ally Bank's (Plaintiff) application for a writ of possession to take possession of a 2023 Ford F-150 motor vehicle from Xiangkai Hu (Defendant). The vehicle is valued at approximately $51,650.00 and Defendant owes Plaintiff $77,480.11. Defendant defaulted under a retail installment sales contract for the vehicle, and Plaintiff is the lienholder. The Court finds that Plaintiff has established the probable validity of its claim to possession of the vehicle and that Defendant has wrongfully detained the vehicle. Since Defendant has no interest in the vehicle, the Court waives the requirement for Plaintiff's undertaking. The Court orders Defendant to transfer the vehicle to Plaintiff forthwith and requires Plaintiff to file and serve a completed copy of Judicial Council Form CD-120 for the Court's review and signature before the writ may issue.
