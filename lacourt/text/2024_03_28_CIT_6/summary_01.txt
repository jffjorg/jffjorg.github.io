And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to continue the hearing on the plaintiff's motion to approve the recording of a lis pendens to April 30, 2024. The plaintiff, Nobia Joyce, is seeking to record a lis pendens to protect her interests in real property and provide notice to the public. The defendant, Shawn M. Millner, et al., oppose the motion, arguing that the plaintiff did not comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 405.36 and that the plaintiff is not justified in seeking approval to record a second lis pendens.

The judge notes that the law requires plaintiffs to record a lis pendens upon commencing an action for quiet title or partition, and that the plaintiff's failure to expunge the prior lis pendens as previously ordered may be a factor in the court's decision. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to file and serve a supplemental brief providing evidence showing that it is more likely than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the defendants on her claims to prevail on the motion.

The judge has also ordered the defendants to file and serve a supplemental opposition and any supporting evidence no later than April 17, 2024, and the plaintiff may file and serve a supplemental reply no later than April 23, 2024. The parties are ordered to address whether any undertaking should be required if the court approves the recording of the lis pendens. The plaintiff is ordered to give notice of the court's ruling within five calendar days of the order.
