Plaintiff must file and serve a  supplemental brief addressing the issues identified herein no later than April  8, 2024. Defendants must file and serve a supplemental opposition no later than  April 17, 2024.

On March 20, 2020, plaintiff Nobia  Joyce (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants Shawn M. Millner, the  Shawn Marie Millner Revocable Trust (collectively, Millner), Laurence Todd  (Todd) (Millner and Todd may be collectively referred to as Defendants), and  Does 1 through 20, alleging causes of action for quiet title, partition,  declaratory relief, and ejectment and damages.  On November 29, 2022, Defendants filed a cross-complaint against  Plaintiff, Stephen R. Golden, Stephen R. Golden & Associates, P.C., and  Does 1 through 20. On February 3, 2023, Defendants filed the operative amended  cross-complaint against the same parties, alleging causes of action for breach  of the July 5, 2018 settlement agreement, breach of the August 12, 2018  co-tenant agreement, assault, battery, false imprisonment, negligent infliction  of emotional distress, intentional infliction of emotional distress, slander of  title, and fraud.  On March 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to approve recording of  lis pendens. On March 5, 2024, Millner opposed the motion. On March 13, 2024,  Todd opposed the motion. On March 20, 2024, Plaintiff replied to both  oppositions.  LEGAL STANDARD              “Immediately upon commencement of the action, the  plaintiff shall file a notice of the pendency of the action in the office of  the county recorder of each county in which any real property described in the  complaint is located.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 761.010, subd. (b).) “(a)  Immediately upon filing the complaint, the plaintiff shall record a notice of  the pendency of the action in the office of the county recorder of each county  in which any real property described in the complaint is located.” (Code Civ.  Proc., § 872.250, subd. (a).)              “Once  a notice of pending action has been expunged, the claimant may not record  another notice of pending action as to the affected property without leave of  the court in which the action is pending.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 405.36; see also  De Martini v. Superior Court (2024) 98 Cal.App.5th 1269, 1276 [holding  that Code Civ. Proc., § 405.36 applied even though the prior lis pendens was  expunged in a different action.])  DISCUSSION  Summary of Arguments  Plaintiff seeks the Court’s approval per Code of Civil Procedure  section 405.36 for the lis pendens she previously recorded for this action and  later filed on May 7, 2020 (the Lis Pendens). Plaintiff indicates that she was  involved in a prior action with the Defendants which involved a lis pendens  that was later expunged. Upon commencing this action, Plaintiff indicates she  recorded and later filed the Lis Pendens. Plaintiff seeks the Court’s approval  because the Court of Appeal’s recent decision in De Martini v. Superior  Court provides that Code of Civil Procedure section 405.36 applies even  when the prior lis pendens was expunged in a different action. Plaintiff  indicates that she moved for the Court’s approval soon after learning of the De  Martini decision since there was no prior case law requiring a party to  seek leave of court to record a second lis pendens when it was filed in a  different case.  In opposition,[1] Defendants contend Plaintiff’s motion is an admission that Plaintiff did not  comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 405.36, and that Plaintiff admits  she failed to comply with the July 5, 2018 order in the earlier case of KC067882  by failing to expunge the prior lis pendens. Defendants then contend Plaintiff  was not justified in filing a second lis pendens without leave just because  this is a different action, and that De Martini only clarified Code of  Civil Procedure section 405.36.  In reply, Plaintiff contends the Lis Pendens should be approved to  protect Plaintiff’s interest in her house and to provide notice to the public  of the dispute over the underlying property. Plaintiff notes that although  Plaintiff’s prior counsel failed to expunge the prior lis pendens as previously  ordered, Plaintiff’s current counsel did expunge it after being retained. Plaintiff  further notes that the law requires plaintiffs to file a lis pendens for quiet  title and partition actions, and contends the fact Plaintiff is seeking the  Court’s approval after a recent change in the law does not invalidate the basis  for seeking this relief.  Analysis  A  real property claim is a cause of action that, if successful, would affect  title to or the right of possession of specific real property or the use of an  easement identified in a pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 405.5; see Id., §  405.20 [“A party to an action who asserts a real property claim may record a  notice of pendency of action in which that real property claim is alleged.”].)  A notice of pendency of action must be expunged, “if the court finds that the  claimant has not established by a preponderance of the evidence the probable  validity of the real property claim.” (Id., § 405.32; De Martini v.  Superior Court (2024) 98 Cal.App.5th 1269, 1278-1279 [“The trial court must  order a lis pendens be expunged if the claimant fails to establish by a  preponderance of the evidence the probable validity of the real property claim.  [Citation.]”) "'Probable validity,' with respect to a real property claim,  means that it is more likely than not that the claimant will obtain a judgment  against the defendant on the claim." (Code Civ. Proc., § 405.3.)  The  law requires plaintiffs to record a lis pendens upon commencing an action for  quiet title or partition. (Code Civ. Proc., § 761.010, subd. (b); Id., §  872.250, subd. (a).) Normally, a lis pendens may be recorded by an attorney  without the courts’ approval. (See Id., § 405.21.) It is only after a  lis pendens has been expunged that the plaintiff must then obtain court  approval to record a second lis pendens. (Id., 405.36; De Martini,  supra, 98 Cal.App.5th at p. 1276.)  The  Court also notes that there does not appear to have been any prior California precedent  reaching the same conclusion as the Court of Appeal did in De Martini.  In De Martini, the Court of Appeal relied on an unpublished federal  opinion, in which the federal district court interpreted Code of Civil  Procedure section 405.36 and held that it applied even though the prior lis  pendens had been expunged in a different action in a different court. (De  Martini, supra, 98 Cal.App.5th at p. 1276, quoting in part Fid. Nat'l Title Co. v. United States SBA (E.D. Cal. 2015) 2015 WL 7077407.) The Court infers from  this that there was no prior case law in California that specifically addressed  the applicability of Code of Civil Procedure section 405.36 across multiple  actions. As such, Plaintiff’s belief that the initiation of a new action  otherwise required Plaintiff to record the lis pendens without first seeking  court approval was reasonable, especially in light of the requirements of Code  of Civil Procedure sections 761.010, subdivision (b), and 872.250, subdivision  (a).  However, the Court notes that Plaintiff’s moving papers  do not address the requirement of Code of Civil Procedure section 405.32, which  requires the Lis Pendens to be expunged unless Plaintiff can establish the  probable validity of her claims by a preponderance of the evidence. (Code Civ.  Proc., § 405.32; De Martini, supra, 98  Cal.App.5th at pp. 1278-1279.) While a lis pendens generally is required in the  context of a quiet title or partition action, (Code Civ. Proc., § 761.010,  subd. (b); Id., § 872.250, subd. (a)), and the recording party usually  may record a lis pendens without leave of court if they are represented by an  attorney, (Id., § 405.21), the present circumstances are different  because the Lis Pendens is the second lis pendens Plaintiff has recorded  against the subject property, and the first lis pendens was ordered expunged. (Pallack Decl., ¶ 2). Code of Civil Procedure  section 405.36 provides that once a lis pendens has been expunged, a claimant  must seek leave of court to record any subsequent lis pendens. (Code Civ.  Proc., § 405.36.) Accordingly, the preponderance of the evidence standard of  proof applies to Plaintiff’s motion, and Plaintiff must submit evidence showing  that it is more likely than not that Plaintiff will obtain a judgment against Defendants  on her claims to prevail on this motion. (See Id., §§ 405.3, 405.32.)  Considering that Defendant’s motion to expunge lis  pendens is pending hearing on April 30, 2024, the Court will continue the  hearing on this motion to April 30, 2024, to be heard in conjunction with  Defendant’s motion, which requires the same legal standard of proof. Plaintiff  must file and serve a supplemental brief providing the necessary evidence under  Code of Civil Procedure section 405.32, no later than April 8, 2024. Defendants  must file and serve a supplemental opposition and any supporting evidence no  later than April 17, 2024. Plaintiff may file and serve a supplemental reply no  later than April 23, 2024. The parties should also address whether any  undertaking should be required if the Court approves the recording of the Lis  Pendens. The briefing ordered as to Plaintiff’s motion will satisfy the  briefing requirements as to Defendants’ motion to expunge the Lis Pendens.  Thus, no further briefing will be necessary for Defendants’ motion to expunge  the Lis Pendens.  CONCLUSION  The Court CONTINUES the hearing on Plaintiff’s motion to approve  recording of lis pendens to April 30, 2024. Plaintiff must file and serve a  supplemental brief addressing the issues identified herein no later than April  8, 2024. Defendants must file and serve a supplemental opposition no later than  April 17, 2024. Plaintiff may file and serve a supplemental reply no later than  April 23, 2024.               Plaintiff is ordered to give notice  of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.
