Motion
for Leave to Amend
 
The court may, in furtherance of justice, and on such terms as may be
proper, allow a party to amend any pleading. 
Code Civ. Proc., §§ 473 & 576. 
Judicial policy favors resolution of all disputed matters between the
parties and, therefore, leave to amend is generally liberally granted.  Ordinarily, the court will not consider the
validity of the proposed amended pleading in ruling on a motion for leave since
grounds for a demurrer or motion to strike are premature.  However, the court does have discretion to
deny leave to amend where a proposed amendment fails to state a valid cause of
action as a matter of law and the defect cannot be cured by further
amendment.   Cal. Casualty General Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1985) 173
Cal.App.3d 274, 281. 
 
The application for leave to amend should be made as soon as the need to
amend is discovered.  The closer the
trial date, the stronger the showing required for leave to amend.  If the party seeking the amendment has been
dilatory, and the delay has prejudiced the opposing party, the court has the
discretion to deny leave to amend.  Hirsa v. Superior Court (1981) 118
Cal.App.3d 486, 490.  Prejudice exists
where the amendment would require delaying the trial, resulting in loss of
critical evidence, or added costs of preparation such as an increased burden of
discovery.  Magpali v. Farmers Group, Inc. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471, 486-488. 
 
Cross-Complainant moves for an order granting leave to file a First
Amended Cross-Complaint to substitute the personal representative of the
deceased Cross-Defendant. The motion is made on the ground that Cross-Defendant
Daniel Patrick Donohue died during the pendency of this litigation and thus a
substitution of the Cross-Defendant is appropriate. Cross-Complainant moves to
substitute decedent’s personal representative – Odane H. Murray. 
 
Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324(a) states: “A motion to amend a pleading
before trial must:
(1) Include a copy of the proposed amendment or amended pleading, which
must be serially numbered to differentiate it from previous pleadings or
amendments;
(2) State what allegations in the previous pleading are proposed to be
deleted, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the deleted
allegations are located; and
(3) State what allegations are proposed to be added to the previous
pleading, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the
additional allegations are located.” 
 
Cross-Complainant has included the proposed amended pleading and
adequately complied with Rule 3.1324(a)(2) and (3). (Motion, page 6, lines 8-27
to page 7, lines 1-4).
 
Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324(b) requires that the moving party must
submit a separate declaration specifying:
“(1) The effect of the amendment;
(2) Why the amendment is necessary and proper;
(3) When the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were
discovered; and
(4) The reasons why the request for amendment was not made earlier.”
 
Cross-Complainant has provided a declaration meeting the requirements of
Rule 3.1324(b)(1) to (4). (Decl., Michael C. Osborne, ¶¶ 2-5.)
 
Therefore, Cross-Complainant’s Motion for Leave to File First Amended
Cross-Complaint is granted. Cross-Complainant is ordered to file and serve the
First Amended Cross-Complaint within 3 days of this date.
 
Cross-Complainant is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
