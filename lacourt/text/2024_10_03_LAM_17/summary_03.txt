Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge, Hon. Jon R. Takasugi, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of MICHAEL SEVERO, JR. and MICHELLE SEVERO against THE ELITE GROUP PROPERTY INSPECTION SERVICE, et al. The Defendants' motion to strike portions of the Plaintiff's Complaint is partially granted and partially denied.

The motion is granted as to the attorneys' fees request, but denied as to the prayer for punitive damages. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's allegations of fraud and breach of fiduciary duty could potentially show that the Defendants engaged in "despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others." However, the Judge notes that whether or not the Defendants' conduct rises to this level is a factual determination that cannot be made at this stage.

The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff has not alleged any facts establishing entitlement to recover attorney fees from the Moving Parties, and therefore grants the Defendants' motion to strike as to this request. The tentative ruling will be adopted as the final order unless the parties submit written arguments or appear in court on the hearing date.
