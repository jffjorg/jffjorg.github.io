Significant Statements:
  - "We agree with the great weight of authority that section 44808 'grants a district [and its employees] immunity [for a student's injuries] unless [the] student was [or should have been] directly supervised during a specific undertaking.'" (LeRoy v. Yarboi (2021) 71 Cal.App.5th 737, 743, 744.)
  - "The school districts in both Hoyem and the instant case place the same emphasis on the situs of the injury as controlling. The court in Hoyem pointed out, however, that when a school district fails to properly supervise a student on school premises, the district cannot automatically escape liability simply because the injury occurred off the school property." (Perna v. Conejo Valley Unified School Dist. (1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 292, 295.)
