The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion by Plaintiff's counsel Elan Darvish to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Iris Au. The ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2), which allows the court to grant an attorney's motion to withdraw from representation after proper notice to the client. The motion is granted because it was made in the proper form and presented with proper notice. The ruling does not involve any disputes or money issues. The next steps are for parties who intend to submit on this tentative to send an email to the court by 4 p.m. the day prior to the hearing, and for the court to adopt this tentative as the final order if all parties submit.
