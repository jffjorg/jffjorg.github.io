STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On June 28, 2021, Plaintiffs Yoo Ha Kang, Young Ae Kang,
and Jinny Hyun Jin Kang (“Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint against Defendants
Kelly Nam (“Nam” or “Defendant”) and all persons unknown, claiming legal or
equitable right, title, estate, lien, or interest in the property described in
the Complaint adverse to Plaintiffs’ title or any cloud upon Plaintiffs’ title,
and Does 1 through 20. (“Defendants”). The complaint alleged four causes of
action: (1) Quiet Title (Prescriptive Easement, (2) Declaratory and Injunctive
Relief, (3) Private Nuisance, and (4) Trespass and Ejectment. The complaint
alleges that the Plaintiffs have used shared driveway, an easement, since 2014,
as the Plaintiffs’ property has a narrow driveway that could lead to car
damage. The Defendants then sent a letter to the Plaintiffs stating that they
were trespassing when using the driveway.  
 
On August 26, 2021, Defendant filed a Motion to Strike,
which was GRANTED, with leave to amend.  
 
On January 14, 2022, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended
Complaint.  
 
On January 26, 2023, Defendant filed an Answer.  
 
On February 3, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a Motion to Strike,
which the court DENIED.
 
On April 11, 2023, Plaintiffs filed an ex parte application seeking an order re contempt due to Nam’s
violating a Preliminary Injunction Order, which the court GRANTED in part,
setting a contempt hearing.
 
On June 14, 2023, after concluding a contempt hearing, the
court found that Christopher (Chris) Nam and Jenny Nam were agents of Kelly
Nam, had knowledge of the Preliminary Injunction Order, and had the ability to
comply with the order. Accordingly, the court found Chris Name and Jenny Nam
guilty of contempt.
 
On August 25, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a motion for attorney’s
fees. 
 
On January 8, 2024, jury trial commenced.
 
On May 3, 2024, the court entered a Third Amendment Judgment
after trial in favor of Plaintiffs.
 
On May 8, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a memorandum of costs.
 
On May 24, 2024, Defendant timely filed the instant motion
to tax costs. On October 30, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an opposition. Any reply
was due on or before November 4, 2024. As of November 6, 2024, the court has
not received a reply.
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
“ ‘The right to recover any of
the costs of a civil action “is determined entirely by statute.” ’ [Citation.]
“ ‘[I]n the absence of an authorizing statute, no costs can be recovered by
either party.” ’ [Citation.] ‘Section 1032 governs the award of costs of trial
court litigation.’ [Citation.]” (Charton
v. Harkey (2016) 247 Cal.App.4th 730, 737.)¿¿ 
¿ 
“Except as otherwise expressly provided by statute, a
prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any
action or proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (b).) (Emphasis added.)
Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, subdivision (a) defines a “prevailing party”
as “[1] the party with a net monetary recovery, [2] a defendant in whose favor
dismissal is entered, [3] a defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant
obtains any relief, and [4] a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not
recover any relief against that defendant.”¿¿ 
¿ 
Costs are allowable if incurred,
whether or not paid. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(1).) Costs must also
be “reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely
convenient or beneficial to its preparation” and must be reasonable in amount.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(2)-(3).)¿¿ 
¿¿ 
A prevailing party claiming costs
must file and serve a memorandum of costs either (1) within 15 days after the
date of service of a notice of entry of judgment or dismissal by the clerk
under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.5, (2) 15 days after the service of
written notice of entry of judgment or dismissal, or (3) within 180 days after
entry of judgment, whichever is first. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700, subd.
(a).)¿¿ 
¿ 
Any motion to strike or tax costs
must be served and filed 15 days after service of the memorandum, plus an
additional 5 days if served by mail or 2 days if served electronically. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1700, subd. (b)(1).) “Unless objection is made to the
entire cost memorandum, the motion to strike or tax costs must refer to each
item objected to by the same number and appear in the same order as the
corresponding cost item claimed on the memorandum of costs and must state why
the item is objectionable.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700, subd. (b)(2).)¿ 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Defendant contends the claimed costs are excessive and lack
proper documentation. Plaintiffs reduced their request to $24,691.38 and
contend their costs are reasonable.[1]
 
Item 4 – Deposition
Costs
 
Defendant objects to the $8,540.08 in deposition costs as
excessive because it is unclear if they incorporate other costs reasonably
incurred. Plaintiffs provide the deposition invoices in support of these costs.
The party
seeking to tax deposition costs bears the burden of proof that the deposition
was unnecessary. (Silver v. Gold (1989)
211 Cal.App.3d 17, 26.) Here,
Defendant did not meet their burden that the depositions were unnecessary. In
fact, Plaintiffs took Defendant’s deposition, and Defendant’s parents’
depositions. (Schorr Decl.¶¶ 8-12, Exhibit A.) Defendants’ parents required
Korean interpretation services to be deposed. (Id.) As such, these costs are reasonable.
 
Accordingly, the court DENIES Defendant’s motion to tax these
costs.
 
Item 5 – Service of
Process Fees
 
Defendant objects to the $659.20 in service of process costs
because Plaintiffs did not detail how the subpoenas were served. Defendant
contends that fees and costs related to postage for sending mail or documents
is prohibited. Plaintiffs argue they incurred $741.60 in service of process
costs, detail those costs, and provide invoices in support. Upon reviewing the
evidence provided by Plaintiff, the costs are reasonable. 
 
Accordingly, the court DENIES Defendant’s motion to tax these
costs.
 
Item 11 – Court
Reporter Fees
 
Defendant objects to the $8,715.57 in court reporter fees
because Plaintiffs did not support this claim. Moreover, Defendant argues that
the parties agreed to split the court reporter costs for trial and did not
agree that the prevailing party would recover those fees. Plaintiffs argue that
Defendant hired the court reporter and seek reimbursement only to the extent
Defendant requests contribution from Plaintiffs for the trial court reporter
fees. Additionally, Plaintiffs note that agreeing to share a court reporter for
trial reduced total costs by half since no agreement would necessitate hiring
two court reporters for trial. 
 
When parties have an unambiguous agreement to share costs
and do not separately state that those costs are recoverable by the prevailing
party, then “such a provision will not be read into the agreement” by the
court. (Anthony v. Xiaobin Li (2020)
47 Cal.App.5th 816, 824.) 
 
Here, the parties have an unambiguous agreement to split the
cost for the court reporter for trial. (Kim Decl. ¶ 2, Exhibit A.) The
agreement does not state that those fees are recoverable by the prevailing
party. 
 
Accordingly, the court GRANTS the motion to tax costs as
to this item.
 
Item 13 –
Interpreter Fees
 
Defendant objects to the $4,437.00 in interpreter fees
because it is unclear if they were incurred for deposition or due to being
deemed an indigent person. Defendant also argues Plaintiffs seek recovery for
trial dates where trial did not occur. Plaintiffs argue the court has
discretion to award them under CCP § 1033.5(c)(4) and seeks to modify the
amount requested to $10,523.00 with supporting invoices.
 
“Items not mentioned in this section and items assessed upon
application may be allowed or denied in the court’s discretion.” (CCP §
1033.5(c)(4).)
 
Here, the interpreter costs are reasonable. First, it is
undisputed that Plaintiffs required Korean interpreters to testify at trial.
(See, e.g., Kim Decl., Exhibit A [confirming each party would order their own
interpreters].) Second, Plaintiffs hired Korean interpreters for two
interpreters during trial to ensure quality of interpretation and to prevent
fatigue. (Schorr Decl. ¶ 19.) Plaintiffs provided the invoices supporting the
costs. (Scholl Decl. ¶ 20, Exhibit C.) 
 
Accordingly, the court DENIES the motion to tax costs as
to this item.
 
Item 16 – Other
Costs
 
Defendant objects to the $975.82 in “other fees” because
they are for “messenger fees” that do not have statutory support. Plaintiffs
argue the court can exercise its discretion to award these costs pursuant to
CCP § 1033.5(c)(4) which consist of courtesy copy delivery, binder retrieval,
document retrieval, and recording the lis pendens. Plaintiffs request a reduced
amount of $875.18.
 
The court has reviewed the invoices provided by Plaintiffs
and exercises its discretion to allow some, but not all, of the requested
costs. First, this court does not require courtesy copy delivery. The court
therefore strikes $319.50 of those costs. Second, document retrieval of trial
binders by a court runner is convenient, not necessary. The court therefore
strike $103.00 of those costs. In total, the court strikes $320.80 of these
costs.
 
Accordingly, the court GRANTS the motion to tax costs in
part as to this item.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.The court GRANTS the motion to
tax costs in part.
2.The court STRIKES the $8,715.57
in costs requested under Item 11.
3.The court STRIKES $320.80 in
costs requested under Item 16.
4.The court Awards the remaining
costs of: $15,655.01 payable within 30 days of this order.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
