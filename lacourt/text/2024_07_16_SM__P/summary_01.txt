And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has considered the arguments presented by the parties in this case, including the defendants' demurrer to the third amended complaint. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants, W.I. Simonson, Watkins, Bland, and Vides, committed fraud and deceit by concealing and suppressing information about the removal and alteration of the plaintiff's vehicle's accident-avoidance system while it was at Simonson's repair facility. The plaintiff also alleges that the defendants conspired to commit fraud, induced Watkins and Bland's false representations, and breached an oral contract for vehicle service.

The judge has found that the fraud cause of action was sufficiently pled, and that the plaintiff has adequately alleged damages of at least $18,000. The judge has also rejected the defendants' argument that the plaintiff's alleged damages occurred prior to any alleged misrepresentations, and has found that the consideration element is met in the alleged oral contract.

The judge has overruled the defendants' demurrer to the third amended complaint, and has allowed the case to proceed to trial.
