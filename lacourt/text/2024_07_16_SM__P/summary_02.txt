And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering HCR Wealth Advisors, Inc.'s (HCR) unopposed motion to amend a 2021 judgment that entered a judgment in favor of HCR on the cross-complaint against Drake. The motion seeks to change the name of the judgment debtor from "HCR Wealth Advisors, Inc." to "HCR Wealth Advisors." HCR argues that it recently discovered that its name on all pleadings and the judgment includes "Inc.", which is not part of its full, legal entity name, as reflected in its amended Articles of Incorporation. The court finds that the evidence demonstrates HCR's correct legal entity name is indeed "HCR Wealth Advisors," and therefore grants the motion to amend the judgment.
