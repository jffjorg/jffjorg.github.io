COURT’S [TENTATIVE]
  RULING RE: 
Terminating Sanctions



[THE
FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]: 
 
I. BACKGROUND
On November 24, 2020, plaintiff
Patricia Ann Mendez (“Plaintiff”) was driving on a freeway when her vehicle was
struck by a van driven by defendant Dong Hai Le (“Defendant”), an employee of
dismissed defendant Home Depot U.S.A. Inc. (“Home Depot”). (Complaint pp. 2–3.)
Plaintiff thereby sustained injuries. (Complaint p. 3.)
 
On November 15, 2022,
Plaintiff initiated the instant lawsuit by filing a complaint alleging a cause
of action for negligence. On March 20, 2023, Plaintiff’s attorney moved to be
relieved as counsel, which motion was granted on April 12, 2023.
 
On June 26, 2023,
Defendant filed an unopposed motion to have requests for admission deemed
admitted, which was granted on August 23, 2023.
 
On September 21, 2023,
Defendant filed an unopposed motion to compel responses to form interrogatories
and special interrogatories, which motion was granted on December 6, 2023.
Plaintiff was ordered to provide verified responses, without objection, to
Defendant’s form interrogatories and special interrogatories within 20 days.
The same day, Defendant filed a Notice of Ruling showing that Plaintiff was
notified of the ruling by e-mail.
 
On November 29, 2023,
Home Depot filed three unopposed motions to compel, which were granted on
January 5, 2024, and an unopposed motion to have requests for admission deemed
admitted, which was granted on January 22, 2024. On February 20, 2024, Home
Depot was dismissed from the case at the request of Plaintiff.
 
On January 17, 2024,
Defendant filed the instant motion for terminating sanctions (the “Motion”).
 
II. MOVING PARTY’S POSITION
 
Defendant
contends that per this court’s December 6 ruling on his motion to compel, the
Plaintiff was ordered to respond to Defendant’s interrogatories within 20 days,
or by December 26, 2023, but Plaintiff failed to do so. (Motion pp. 3–4.)
Defendant observes that disobeying a court order to provide discovery is a
misuse of the discovery process. (Id. at p. 4.) Defendant further
observes that this court has the authority to impose a terminating sanction and
that Defendant served a notice of the December 6 ruling on Plaintiff. (Id.
at pp. 4–5.) Defendant argues that terminating sanctions are warranted given
that there is no excuse for Plaintiff’s failure to comply with this court’s
December 6 order. (Id. at pp. 5–6.)
 
III. DISCUSSION
 
The court may impose a
terminating sanction by an order striking out the pleadings or parts of the
pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d)(1).) “The trial court may order a terminating
sanction for discovery abuse ‘after considering the totality of the
circumstances: [the] conduct of the party to determine if the actions were
willful; the detriment to the propounding party; and the number of formal and
informal attempts to obtain the discovery.’” (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez
(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390.)   
 
“The discovery statutes
evince an incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary
sanctions and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Doppes v.
Bentley Motors, Inc.¿(2009) 174 Cal.App.4th
967, 992; see J.W. v. Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc.¿(2018) 29 Cal.App.5th
1142, 1169.) If a lesser sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is
warranted. (Doppes, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at 992.) “Discovery sanctions
‘should be appropriate to the dereliction, and should not exceed what is
required to protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied
discovery.’” (Ibid.) “But where a violation is willful, preceded by a
history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not
produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in
imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Id., quoting Mileikowsky v. Tenet
Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279–280); Creed-21 v. City of
Wildomar¿(2017) 18 Cal.App.5th
690, 702, quoting Doppes and Mileikowsky.)¿¿ 
 
For example, the Third
District held that terminating sanctions were warranted when a party repeatedly
failed to propound adequate discovery responses, even after the court imposed
monetary sanctions. (Liberty Mutual Fire Ins. Co. v. LcL Administrations,
Inc. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 1093.) In Mileikowsky, the Court of
Appeal held that five motions to compel created a record “replete with evidence
of [appellant’s] failures to answer discovery requests.” (Mileikowsky, supra,
128 Cal.App.4th at 279–280.)
 
The court should consider
the totality of the circumstances, including conduct of the party to determine
if the actions were willful, the determent to the propounding party, and the
number of formal and informal attempts to obtain discovery. (Lang v. Hochman
(2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.) Terminating sanctions should not be
ordered lightly, but are justified where a violation is willful, preceded by a
history of abuse, and there is evidence that less severe sanctions would not
produce compliance with the discovery rules. (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) 
 
Before any sanctions may
be imposed the court must make an express finding that there has been a willful
failure of the party to serve the required discovery responses. (Fairfield
v. Superior Court for Los Angeles County (1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 113, 118.)
The party who failed to comply with discovery obligations has the burden of
showing that the failure was not willful. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84
Cal.App.3d 771, 788; Cornwall v. Santa Monica Dairy Co. (1977) 66
Cal.App.3d 250, 252-253.)   
 
Plaintiff has exhibited a
consistent pattern of not participating in this lawsuit and not complying with
her discovery obligations in this lawsuit. She failed to respond to discovery
requests from both defendants, causing both Defendant and Home Depot to bring
motions to compel, none of which she opposed. Plaintiff did not timely appear
at any of the hearings on these motions. She then failed to comply with the
December 6 order to respond to Defendant’s interrogatories, causing Defendant
to bring the Motion, which she again does not oppose. The hearing on the Motion
was originally scheduled for March 5, 2024, but it was continued after
Plaintiff failed to make an appearance. Additionally, Plaintiff has not
appeared at any of the Case Management Conferences since her former attorney
was relieved as her counsel (no appearances for Plaintiff at Case Management
Conferences on March 5, 2024; January 22, 2024; January 2, 2024; August 23,
2023; and May 22, 2023). In a Case Management Statement dated February 27, 2024
and filed March 4, 2024, Defendant indicated that Plaintiff has thus far not
responded to any discovery. (March 4, 2024 CMS p. 5.) Monetary sanctions
against Plaintiff have been previously ordered but not paid.
 
Having failed to oppose
the Motion or raise any excuse as to why she has thus far failed to respond to
any discovery despite having been ordered to do so by this court, Plaintiff has
failed to meet her burden of showing that this failure to respond was not willful.
However, Defendant has not made any showing that it has attempted to formally
or informally obtain discovery since the December 6 court order was issued from
Plaintiff beyond serving her with the notice of the court order. And, the
December 6 court order is the first court order that Plaintiff has disobeyed. We
therefore decline to find that Plaintiff’s failure to comply with the December
6 court order was willful. Absent this finding, we may not impose terminating
sanctions.
 
Accordingly, this court
DENIES the Motion.
