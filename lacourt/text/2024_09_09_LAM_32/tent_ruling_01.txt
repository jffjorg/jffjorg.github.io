  Case No.:  20STCV04529
  Hearing Date:  September 9, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
     plaintiffs’ motions to
  compel 
     responses and deem 
     matters admitted 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On March 27, 2020, Plaintiffs Craig
Sallin, Croesus Investments, LLC, Linda Snyder-Kelbaugh, Sun Coast
Distributing, Inc., Sun Pacific Group, Inc., and Jerry James filed this action
for breach of contract against Defendants Joe Samuel Bailey and Renew Spinal
Care, Inc. The operative First Amended Complaint was filed on March 27,
2020.  
            The FAC asserts a single cause of
action for breach of written settlement agreement. The FAC alleges that
Plaintiffs invested money to Defendants in 2014 and 2015 and that the parties
reached a settlement in 2019 resolving disputes over the amount owed. This
action stems from Defendants’ alleged failure to pay the amounts required by
the 2019 agreement.  
            On April 10, 2024, Defendants filed
a cross-complaint against Plaintiffs for declaratory relief and usury.
Defendants allege that the 2019 agreement was designed to impose an interest
rate above 10% on repayment of the prior loans and is thus a disguised usurious
loan agreement.
            At issue currently are numerous
motions to compel responses and deem matters admitted filed by Plaintiffs
against the various Defendants. Defendants have not filed any opposition.    
LEGAL STANDARD
Discovery responses are due 30 days after
service of the requests, unless the parties stipulate or the court orders
otherwise. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260(a), 2031.260(a), 2033.250(a).) If a
responding party fails to respond in time, the propounding party may move for
an order compelling the responses or deeming matters admitted. (Id., §§
2030.290(b), 2031.300(b), 2033.280(b).) The responding party also waives its
objections. (Id., §§ 2030.290(a), 2031.300(a), 2033.280(a).)  
DISCUSSION
The issue is identical across the various
motions, i.e., Defendants have not responded to the discovery within the
statutory deadline. (See Kent Decl.) Thus, an order compelling the responses is
warranted. Furthermore, the matters raised in the RFAs are deemed admitted
unless Defendants serve substantially code-compliant responses before the
hearing on the motions. 
Sanctions are warranted as Defendants
provide no substantial justification for their failure to timely respond to
discovery. Given the simplicity and identical nature of the motions, the
reasonable amount is $2,800, representing 7 hours at $400 per hour. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiffs’ motions to compel
responses and deem matters admitted are GRANTED. Defendants shall provide
verified responses without objection (except as to privacy and privilege)
within 20 days of this order. RFAs are deemed admitted unless Defendants serve
substantially code-compliant responses before the hearing on September 9, 2024.
The Court sanctions Defendants in the total amount of $2,800, to be paid within
30 days of this order.
