And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to compel further responses filed by the defendant, J. Paul Getty Trust. The motions were filed in response to the plaintiff, Odile Madden's, failure to fully answer the defendant's interrogatories and requests for production.

The judge finds that the plaintiff failed to fully answer the defendant's interrogatories, particularly FROG No. 9.2, which asked for the identification of documents supporting the existence or amount of any items of damages claimed. The judge grants the motion to compel further responses as to FROG No. 9.2.

The judge also grants the motion to compel further responses as to RFP Nos. 19-20 and 59-61, which seek production of documents and information related to the plaintiff's allegations and damages. The judge finds that the defendant has established good cause for production and that the requests are not overly burdensome or seeking sensitive information.

The judge orders the plaintiff to provide further responses to the defendant's interrogatories and requests for production within 20 days of the order. The production of documents shall be subject to a protective order.

The judge denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions and finds that the defendant has satisfied the meet and confer requirement. The judge's ruling is tentative and subject to change based on any further submissions or arguments made by the parties.
