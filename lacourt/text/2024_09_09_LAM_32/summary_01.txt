And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, granting their motions to compel responses and deem matters admitted. The plaintiffs have requested that the defendants respond to discovery requests within the statutory deadline, which was not met by the defendants. As a result, the judge has ordered the defendants to provide verified responses without objection within 20 days of the order. If the defendants fail to do so, the matters raised in the requests for admission (RFAs) will be deemed admitted. The judge has also sanctioned the defendants in the amount of $2,800, to be paid within 30 days of the order, due to their failure to provide a substantial justification for their failure to timely respond to discovery.
