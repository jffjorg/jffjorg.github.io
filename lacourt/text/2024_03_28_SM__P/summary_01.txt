And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' demurrer and motion to strike the plaintiff's first amended complaint. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants, High Horse Malibu, LLC, Terkleson & Szczepanik, were negligent in allowing their employee to lift the horse's leg while the plaintiff was on the horse, resulting in the plaintiff's injuries. The defendants argue that the plaintiff assumed the risk of horseback riding and that the plaintiff failed to plead sufficient facts to state a cause of action.

The Judge has ruled that the plaintiff's first cause of action for negligence is sufficient, as it alleges that the defendants owed a duty of care, breached that duty, and caused the plaintiff's injuries. The Judge has also ruled that the doctrine of primary assumption of the risk does not apply in this case, as the defendants increased the inherent risks of horseback riding by lifting the horse's leg.

The Judge has sustained the defendants' demurrer as to the second cause of action for premises liability, as the plaintiff's allegations do not state a separate premises liability claim. The Judge has also sustained the defendants' demurrer as to the third cause of action for negligent supervision, as the plaintiff's allegations do not show that the defendants had prior knowledge of the employee's propensity to lift the horse's leg.

Finally, the Judge has granted the defendants' motion to strike the plaintiff's request for attorney's fees, as the plaintiff's complaint does not identify any statutory or contract provision for such fees.
