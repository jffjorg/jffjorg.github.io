MOTION


Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings



 
MOTION
In its July 2,
2024, this Court continued to this date the motion it set for judgment on the
pleadings on the first amended complaint filed by Plaintiff Lance Bledsoe
(“Plaintiff”) and the order to show cause for Plaintiff’s failure to file proof
of service of the complaint.  In that order,
the Court directed Plaintiff to file a written response to the motion for
judgment on the pleadings by no later than September 9, 2024.  Plaintiff failed to do so and to otherwise articulate
a good faith basis for maintaining this action. 

Accordingly, the
Court dismisses this cause with prejudice as frivolous.  (See Huang v. Hanks (2018) 23
Cal.App.5th 179, 181-182 [trial court has inherent authority to dismiss patently
frivolous claims].  
The Court’s clerk
shall provide notice of this order to Plaintiff.
