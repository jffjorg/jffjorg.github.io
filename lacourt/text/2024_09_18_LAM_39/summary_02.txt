And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling dismissing a lawsuit brought by Lance Bledsoe with prejudice as frivolous. The lawsuit was filed in July 2024, and the judge continued the motion for judgment on the pleadings to September 18, 2024. However, the plaintiff failed to file a written response to the motion and failed to articulate a good faith basis for maintaining the action. As a result, the judge has dismissed the case, citing the authority of Huang v. Hanks (2018) 23 Cal.App.5th 179, 181-182, which states that the trial court has the power to dismiss patently frivolous claims. The court's clerk will notify the plaintiff of the order.
