  Michael Z. Hermalyn and FVP, LLC



  
BACKGROUND
Defendant
DraftKings Inc. (“Defendant”) has moved to dismiss or stay this action based on
inconvenient forum.  Plaintiffs Michael
Z. Hermalyn (“Hermalyn”) and FVP, LLC (“Fanatics,” collectively, “Plaintiffs”) oppose
the motion.  
ANALYSIS
Hermalyn signed various agreements with
Defendant which include forum selection clauses.  Those clauses specify any disputes should be
resolved in Massachusetts, and Massachusetts substantive law applies.  (See Declaration of Katherine V.A. Smith
filed May 10, 2024, Exhibit B.)  Pursuant
to California law, a forum-selection clause is presumptively valid and is
enforceable unless the opposing party meets the “heavy burden” of proving
enforcement would be unreasonable under the circumstances of the case.  (Bancomer S.A. v. Superior Court (1996)
44 Cal.App.4th 1450, 1457.)  When a
contract contains a forum-selection clause that requires litigation to proceed
exclusively in one forum, the court will enforce the clause unless it is
unreasonable.  (Animal Film, LLC v.
D.E.J. Productions, Inc. (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 466, 471.)  “A clause is reasonable if it has a logical
connection with at least one of the parties or their transaction.”  (Verdugo v. Alliantgroup, L.P. (2015)
237 Cal.App.4th 141, 147 (Verdugo).)  Given that Defendant is headquartered in
Massachusetts, the forum-selection clause is reasonable.
As Plaintiffs point out, their claims are
based on Hermalyn’s unwaivable statutory rights under California law.  Under Business and Professions Code section
16600, “every contract by which anyone is restrained from engaging in a lawful
profession, trade, or business of any kind is to that extent void.”  A former employee may sue for injunctive
relief to enjoin enforcement of a covenant not to compete.  (Bus. & Prof. Code, §§ 16600, 16600.5.)[1]
 As such, Defendant “bears the burden to
show litigating the claims in the contractually-designated forum will not
diminish in any way the substantive rights afforded under California law.”  (Verdugo, supra, 237 Cal.App.4th
at p. 147, internal quotations and citations omitted.)  Defendant fails to do so.  Unless Defendant stipulates to the application
of California substantive law regarding covenants not to compete, Massachusetts
is not a suitable alternative forum, as Massachusetts law infringes on
Hermalyn’s unwaivable statutory rights. 
Therefore, the motion is denied.
Defendant contends Plaintiffs’ rights under section
16600 are not unwaivable.  Defendant is
incorrect.  “Any one may waive the
advantage of a law intended solely for his benefit. But a law established for a
public reason cannot be contravened by a private agreement.”  (Civ. Code, § 3513.)  Section 16600 advances the public interest in
permitting employees “to practice [their]
profession.”  (Edwards v. Arthur
Andersen LLP (2008) 44 Cal.4th 937, 948.) 
The Court, therefore, concludes the protections afforded by section
16600 are unwaivable. 
Defendant also argues the Court should stay this
matter pending the Supreme Court of California’s decision in EpicentRx v. S.C. (review granted December 13, 2023, S282521).  Defendant cites no authority for the
proposition the Court should stay this case indefinitely pending that decision
when indefinite delay would, in essence, moot Plaintiffs’ claims.  
Further, the Court notes Defendant has taken at
least two depositions in this matter (see e.g., Declaration of Katherine V.A.
Smith filed May 28, 2024, Exhibits C, D), conducted other discovery, and engaged
in motion practice.  Such activity has exceeded
the scope of establishing the grounds for enforceability of the forum selection
clause.  The substantial litigation
Defendant has conducted to date “conflicts with [Defendant’s] assertion that
California is an inconvenient forum . . . .” 
(Martinez v. Ford Motor Co. (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 9, 19.)
Plaintiffs are ordered to give notice of this
order and to file proof of service of same.
