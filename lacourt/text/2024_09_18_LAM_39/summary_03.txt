Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to dismiss or stay the action based on inconvenient forum. The defendant, DraftKings Inc., argued that the forum selection clause in the agreements between Michael Z. Hermalyn and FVP, LLC (Plaintiffs) specifies Massachusetts as the forum and Massachusetts substantive law applies. However, the judge held that the forum selection clause is reasonable and enforceable, but only if the defendant stipulates to the application of California substantive law regarding covenants not to compete. The judge also rejected the defendant's argument that the Court should stay the matter pending the Supreme Court of California's decision in EpicentRx v. S.C., as it would result in an indefinite delay and potentially moot the Plaintiffs' claims.
