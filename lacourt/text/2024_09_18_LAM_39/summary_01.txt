And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication filed by the defendants in a lawsuit brought by the plaintiff, Tami K. Alan. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants are liable for employment claims, but the defendants argue that the claims are time-barred and that the plaintiff failed to exhaust her administrative remedies.

The judge is focusing on two issues: (1) whether the settlement agreement in another case (BC454062) tolls the statute of limitations, and (2) whether the settlement in another case (BC576936) bars the plaintiff's fourth cause of action. The judge finds that the settlement agreement in BC454062 tolls the statute of limitations for five years, and that the settlement in BC576936 releases the claims raised in that action, including the wage and hour claims at issue in the plaintiff's fourth cause of action.

The judge grants the defendants' motion for summary adjudication of the fourth cause of action, finding that the plaintiff has failed to raise triable issues of material fact as to whether she can prevail on that claim. The judge also denies the defendants' motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication on the other claims, finding that the plaintiff has raised triable issues of material fact as to those claims.
