Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has scheduled an evidentiary hearing on January 19, 2024, to determine whether the Plaintiff, Amelia Joaquim Rowell, executed the Mutual and Voluntary Agreement to Arbitrate Claims on March 7, 2022. The Defendants, National University, et al., are seeking to compel arbitration based on this agreement. The Plaintiff disputes having executed the agreement and argues that it is unconscionable and illegal. The Judge finds that the agreement is not procedurally unconscionable, but notes that there is unequal bargaining power between the parties. The Judge also finds that the agreement is not substantively unconscionable, as it does not require unusual fees or restrict discovery. The Judge will consider the evidence presented at the evidentiary hearing to determine whether the Plaintiff assented to the agreement and whether it should be enforced.
