And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has made a tentative ruling on the motion to enforce subpoena filed by the plaintiff, Paul Van Kleef. The motion is denied. The subpoena was served on Beitchman & Kekian, PC, a third-party law firm, seeking documents related to their representation of Clean Concept and Lubov Azria. Beitchman has asserted that all responsive, non-privileged documents have been served, and that the withheld documents are either attorney work-product, privileged communications, or confidential corporate documents. The court finds that the work-product privilege is not waived in this action, and that Beitchman owes independent duties to the non-Clean Concept entities. Therefore, the court will not require Beitchman to potentially violate its ethical duties. The court also declines to award sanctions to either party.
