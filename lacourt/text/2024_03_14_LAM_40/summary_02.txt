Roles:

  - Defendant: LAUSD
Significant Statements:
  - "There is â€¦ a precondition to the taking of judicial notice in either its mandatory or permissive form[:] [A]ny matter to be judicially noticed must be relevant to a material issue."
  - "The determination of what constitutes a public purpose is primarily a matter for the Legislature to determine, and its discretion will not be disturbed by the courts so long as that determination has a reasonable basis."
```

The judge's tentative ruling denies LAUSD's motion for judgment on the pleadings, finding that AB 218 is not unconstitutional and that the revival of previously time-barred claims does not violate the Gift Clause. The ruling concludes that the Legislature has the power to revive lapsed claims and exempt them from the claims presentation requirement of the Government Tort Claims Act, and that the elimination of the prefiling claims requirement and retroactivity component of AB 218 does not create liability for the defendant.
