 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Defendant Los
  Angeles Unified School District’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings.



 
I. Background
A. Pleadings
Plaintiff E.M.—a citizen and
resident of the State of Arkansas—sues Defendants Doe 1 Los Angeles Unified School
District (LAUSD) and Does 2 through 25 pursuant to a January 6, 2023, First
Amended Complaint (FAC) alleging claims of (1) Negligence (School), (2)
Negligence (Does 2 through 25), (3) Negligent Hiring, Retention, and
Supervision (School), and (4) Negligent Hiring, Retention, and Supervision
(Does 2 through 25).
The claims arise from the following
allegations. From approximately 1987 to 1988, when Plaintiff was approximately
ten years old, Plaintiff was sexually abused and assaulted by an LAUSD teacher,
Eugene Rosen, on numerous occasions over the course of approximately a one-year
period. The acts of sexual abuse and assault perpetrated against Plaintiff by Eugene
Rosen took place on LAUSD premises. The inappropriate behavior and rumors of
Eugene Rosen were well known at LAUSD, which, observed by any reasonable
person, would raise suspicion and merit an investigation. E.M. reported
inappropriate touching of E.M.’s shoulders to multiple teachers at the school
and the principal of the school. Despite the foregoing, no action was taken, no
investigation was completed, and Eugene Rosen continued to sexually abuse and
assault E.M.
B. Motion Before the Court
On November 13, 2024, LAUSD filed a
motion for judgment on the pleadings against the Complaint’s claims.
On February 13, 2024, Plaintiff
E.M. filed an opposition to LAUSD’s motion.
On March 7, 2024, LAUSD replied to
Plaintiff E.M.’s opposition.
LAUSD’s motion is now before the
Court.
 
II. Requests for Judicial Notice
Per Plaintiff E.M.’s request, the
Court takes judicial notice of the Assembly floor analysis AB 218 dated August
30, 2019. (Opp’n, RJN, Ex. 12; Evid. Code, §§ 452, subds. (c), (h), 453, subds.
(a)-(b).)
However, the Court declines to take
notice of the eleven rulings by other trial courts in relation to whether AB
218 violates the Gift Clause. (Opp’n, RJN, Exs. 1-11.) “There is … a
precondition to the taking of judicial notice in either its mandatory or
permissive form[:] [A]ny matter to be judicially noticed must be relevant to a
material issue.” (People ex rel. Lockyer v. Shamrock Foods Co. (2000) 24
Cal.4th 415, 422 fn. 2.) The orders advanced for notice by E.M. simply do not
relate to the face of the pleadings here or the Court’s analysis of the
relevant authorities and proper interpretation of the law.
 
III. Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings
A. Legal Standard
Either prior to trial or at the
trial—and barring statutory provisions otherwise—the plaintiff or the defendants
may move for judgment on the pleadings where the appropriate ground for such a
motion is the same as that arguable by general demurrer, namely, the failure to
state a cause of action or defense. (Dobbins v. Hardister (1966) 242
Cal.App.2d 787, 791 A motion for JOP is used to challenge a pleading in the
same manner as a general demurrer—that is, the challenged pleading (1)
establishes that the court does not have subject-matter jurisdiction or (2)
does not allege facts sufficient to support a cause of action or defense. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (c)(1); see Marzec v. Public Empls. Ret. Sys. (2015)
236 Cal.App.4th 889, 900; International Assn of Firefighters v. City of San
Jose (2011) 195 Cal.App.4th 1179, 1196.)
To sufficiently allege a cause of
action, a complaint must allege all the ultimate facts—that is, the facts
needed to establish each element of the cause of action pleaded. (Committee
on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197,
212, superseded by statute as stated in Branick v. Downey Savings & Loan
Assn. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 235, 242.) In testing the sufficiency of the cause
of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly
pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.)
Courts read the allegations liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los
Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228,
disapproved on other grounds in Jones v. Lodge at Torrey Pines Partnership
(2008) 42 Cal.4th 1158, 1162.) However, this analysis “does not admit
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab
Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.) The face of the complaint includes exhibits
attached to the complaint. (Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d
91, 94.) If facts appearing in the exhibits contradict those alleged, the facts
in the exhibits take precedence. (Holland v. Morse Diesel Intern., Inc.
(2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447, superseded by statute on other grounds as
stated in White v. Cridlebaugh (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 506, 521.)
As with a demurrer, the grounds for
a motion for judgment on the pleadings must appear on the face of the pleading
or be based on facts capable of judicial notice. (Bufil v. Dollar Fin. Grp.
(2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 1193, 1202, disapproved on other grounds in Noel v.
Thrifty Payless, Inc. (2019) 7 Cal.5th 955, 985-986, fn. 15.) The only
significant difference between the two motions is that a motion for judgment on
the pleadings is brought after the time to file a general demurrer has expired.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (f); Caldera Pharms. v. Regents of the Univ.
of Cal. (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 338, 350; International Assn of
Firefighters v. City of San Jose, supra, at p. 1196.)
B. Motion for Judgment on the
Pleadings, Entire Complaint, Violation of Gift Clause: DENIED.
1. Parties’ Arguments
LAUSD demurs to the Complaint as a whole
on the grounds that the claims are premised on a change to the law known as AB
218, which was passed in 2020, eliminated the claims presentation requirement
for childhood sexual abuse cases for conduct arising on or after January 1,
2009, and added a new subsection to Government Code section 905 making the
changes to the statute retroactive, actions which amount to a violation of the
California Constitution’s Gift Clause. (Mot., pp. 7-12.)
The opposition contests this position,
and the reply responds thereto. (Opp’n, pp. 2-9; Reply, pp. 2-4.)
2. Analysis
After review, the Court finds in
favor of Plaintiff E.M.
a. AB 218 is Not
Unconstitutional
Here,
the Court is unpersuaded that the Legislature lacks the power to revive lapsed
claims and exempt said claims from the claim presentation requirement of the
Government Tort Claims Act.
The test for “whether or not a proposed application of
public funds is to be deemed a gift within the meaning [of the gift clause], …
is … whether the money is to be used for a public or a private purpose.” (City
of Oakland v. Garrison (1924) 194 Cal. 298, 302.) “The determination of
what constitutes a public purpose is primarily a matter for the Legislature to
determine, and its discretion will not be disturbed by the courts so long as
that determination has a reasonable basis. [Citations.]” (County of Alameda
v. Carleson (1971) 5 Cal.3d 730, 746.) Legislative findings are to be
“given great weight and will be upheld unless they are found to be unreasonable
and arbitrary. [Citations.]” (California Hous. Fin. Agency v. Elliot
(1976) 17 Cal.3d 575, 583.) 
A review of the legislative history of AB 218 shows its
public purpose. An August 30, 2019 Assembly discussion of AB 218 —at which AB
218 was voted on—shows that AB 218’s purposes are: to help prevent future
assaults by raising the cost for sexual assault of minors; to protect victims
of sexual assault rather than the perpetrators, who benefit from statutes of
limitations; to confront cover ups of sexual abuse in institutions, thus
preventing continuing victimization and the sexual assault of additional children;
and to create an effective deterrent against individuals and entities who have
chosen to protect the perpetrators of sexual assault over the victims. (Opp’n,
RJN, Ex. 12 [attaching Assm. Floor analysis AB 218 (2019-2020 Reg. Sess.) (Sep.
14, 2019) 2019 CA A.B. 218].) The Court finds that these comments sufficiently
state the public purposes for the Legislature’s passage of AB 218, such that,
even if AB 218 permits a private individual to recover individualized monetary
relief based on sexual assault, that benefit serves the public by deterring
sexual assault generally and protecting minors. 
Moreover, a question remains as to
how a statute requiring a public entity to defend a tort claim it thought had
expired constitutes an unlawful gift of public money where the same defense
employed in a new case just filed would not violate the Gift Clause. Both
require a plaintiff to prove wrongdoing and damages to recover. Nothing in
section Code of Civil Procedure section 340.1, subdivision (q), or Government
Code section 905, subdivisions (m) and (p)—statutory sections modified by AB
218—obligate any defendant, individually or collectively with the other
statutory sections, to pay monies related to a meritless claim. As highlighted
in an authority cited by LAUSD: “We are not strongly impressed with the
contention of the respondent that the application of funds to pay judgments
obtained against the state constitutes a gift of public money, within the
prohibition of the Constitution … The judgments which are to be paid bear no
semblance to gifts. They must be first obtained in courts of competent
jurisdiction, to which the parties have submitted their claims in the manner
directed by law. In other words, they are judgments obtained after the
requirements of due process of law have been complied with.” (See Heron v.
Riley, 209 Cal. 507, 517.)
b. LAUSD’s Cited Authority is
Distinguishable
LAUSD’s cited authority (Opp’n,
10-12) is factually distinguishable because those decisions involved
circumstances where the legislature appropriated funds to pay specific
individuals (Bourn v. Hart (1892) 93 Cal. 321, 326-328; Conlin v.
Board of Supervisors (1893) 99 Cal.17, 21-23) passed legislation that a
specific class of persons would be paid a specified amount out of a county’s or
other public entity’s general funds (Powell v. Phelan (1903) 138 Cal.
271, 273-274, Heron v. Riley, supra, 209 Cal. at 517). AB 218 does
neither of these things, but rather revives previously time-barred claims that
accrued when the sexual assault occurred but must still be proven in a court of
competent jurisdiction in the manner provided by law, consistent with due process
requirements. Any claims presentation was abolished by AB 218 and its
application is retroactive to the allegations here, which occurred from 1987 to
1988.
The cases LAUSD relies on also
predate the Government Claims Act, enacted in 1963. Before the Government
Claims Act was enacted, “tort liability for public entity defendants was barred
by a common law rule of governmental immunity. Over time, however, the common
law rule became ‘riddled with exceptions,’ both legislative and judge made, and
in 1961 this court abolished the rule altogether [in Muskopf v. Corning
Hospital Dist. (1961) 55 Cal.2d 211, 214].” (Quigley v. Garden Valley
Fire Protection Dist. (2019) 7 Cal.5th 798, 803.) More than a decade after
the Government Claims Act was passed, the California Supreme Court pronounced
that “Government Code section 815 restores sovereign immunity in California
except as provided in the Tort Claims Act or other statute.” (Williams v.
Horvath (1976) 16 Cal.3d 834, 838.) 
However, even if the Legislature
confined potential governmental liability to “rigidly delineated
circumstances,” the Court is not persuaded that the Legislature is barred from
changing those circumstances, nor is it persuaded that the Legislature necessarily
“creates liability” when it eliminates a statutory immunity that previously
applied to a negligent act that occurred in the past, e.g., in the form of the
elimination of the prefiling claims requirement and retroactivity challenged here.
In dicta in Shirk v. Vista Unified School Dist. (2007) 42 Cal.4th 201,
213, superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in Rubenstein v. Doe
No. 1 (2017) 3 Cal.5th 903, 914-916, the California Supreme Court stated
that if the Legislature “intended to … revive … the claim representation
requirement under the government claims statute, it could have easily said so,”
implying the Legislature’s ability to make the changes it did in AB 218
relating to subdivisions (m) and (p) in Government Code section 905. And here,
as briefly discussed above, any cause of action against Eugene Rosen, the
offending teacher, accrued at the time the cause of action was complete with
all its elements. (Fox v. Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. (2005) 35 Cal.4th
797, 806-807.) Those elements, in the light most favorable to the pleadings,
accrued at the time of the alleged abuse in 1988 at the latest. The exposure to
LAUSD would have been created at the same time under a negligence or negligent
supervision theory, such as here, subject to the claims presentation
requirement at the time. As such, unlike LAUSD’s cited authority, liability
initially existed and was simply revived by AB 218.
c. The California Supreme Court
Has Denied Review of Similar Arguments
Last, the Court briefly notes that
the California Supreme Court has denied review of a court of appeal denial of a
petition for writ of mandate filed by a California school district against a
trial court overruling the school district’s demurrer to a pleading, where the
demurrer was based on the arguments that AB 218 was not constitutional based on
its elimination of the Government Claims Act requirement and retroactivity
component. (Jamie Hill v. Stockton Unified School District, a public entity
et al. (Super. Ct. San Joaquin County, 2022, No. STK-CV-UNPI-2022-0001471)
(Dec. 21, 2022) [trial court ruling overruling demurrer based on AB 218
unconstitutionality arguments]; Stockton Unified School District v. The Superior
Court of San Joaquin County (Apr. 17, 2023, C098020) [petition for writ of
mandate denied], review den. Stockton Unified School District v. S.C. (Hill)
(May 31, 2023, S279636).)
LAUSD’s motion is thus DENIED. 
IV. Conclusion
Defendant Los Angeles Unified
School District’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is DENIED.
