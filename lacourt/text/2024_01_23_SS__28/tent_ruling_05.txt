 Case Number:  21STCV39388    Hearing Date:   January 23, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
October 26, 2021, Plaintiffs Elia Morales, Jose Saenz, Sonia Morales Martinez,
and Leonel Curiel, a minor, appearing by and through his guardian ad litem Sonia
Morales Martinez, filed this action against Defendants Dong Jin Chu (“Chu”),
DJC Transportation, Inc. (“DJC”), and Does 1-25 for negligence. 
On
December 2, 2021, Defendants Chu and DJC filed an answer. 
On
June 27, 2022, the Court found that this case (21STCV39388) and case number 21STCV45209
are related within the meaning of California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a).  Case number 21STCV39388 became the lead case.  The cases were assigned to Department 28 of
the Spring Street Courthouse for all purposes. 
On
December 18, 2023, Petitioner submitted a petition for approval of minor’s compromise
to be heard on January 23, 2024. 
PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
Sonia Morales Martinez (“Petitioner”) asks the Court to approve the compromise
of the pending action of Leonel Curiel. 
DISCUSSION 
Section
12a(1) of the petition states that medical expenses totaled $891.00.  Section 12a(3) of the petition states that the
total amount of medical expenses has been reduced by $534.60 as the result of
negotiated, statutory, or contractual reductions.  This should mean that the remaining amount
($356.40) will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.  However, Section 12a(4) of the petition states
that none of the medical expenses will be paid or reimbursed from the
settlement proceeds.  While Section
12a(2) of the petition states that $356.40 of the medical expenses were paid,
the petition does not state who paid those expenses or whether the person or
entity who paid those expenses has waived the right to be reimbursed from the
settlement proceeds.  The Court cannot
approve a petition unless it reimburses all medical expenses that have not been
waived or reduced. 
The
Court denies the petition. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice the petition to approve the compromise of
Plaintiff Leonel Curiel’s claims filed by Petitioner Sonia Morales Martinez. Petitioner is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within
five days.
