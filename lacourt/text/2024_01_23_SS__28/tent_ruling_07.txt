considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On August
29, 2022, Plaintiff Nadereh Kangavari (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
Defendants Cedars Sinai Medical Center (“Medical Center”), Cedars Sinai Health
System (“Health System”), and Does 1-50 for general negligence and premises
liability. 
On
October 17, 2022, Medical Center and Health System (“Defendants”) filed an answer. 
On
November 9, 2023, Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment to be heard
on November 7, 2024. 
On
November 21, 2023, Defendants filed a motion to continue the trial to
accommodate their summary judgment motion, set for January 17, 2024.  The Court continued the hearing to January
23, 2024.  Plaintiff has not filed an
opposition. 
Trial
is currently scheduled for February 26, 2024. 
PARTIES’ REQUEST 
Defendants ask the Court to continue the trial to a date after the November 7, 2024 hearing on their summary judgment motion. 
LEGAL STANDARD  
California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(b), provides that “a party seeking a continuance of
the date set for trial, whether contested or uncontested or stipulated to by
the parties, must make the request for a continuance by a noticed motion or an
ex parte application under the rules in chapter 4 of this division, with
supporting declarations. The party must make the motion or application as soon
as reasonably practical once the necessity for the continuance is discovered.” 
          Under
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c), the Court may grant a continuance
only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the continuance.
Circumstances that may indicate good cause include “a party's excused inability
to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite
diligent efforts,” or the unavailability of a party, counsel, or expert due to
death, illness or other excusable circumstance. The Court should consider all
facts and circumstances relevant to the determination, such as proximity of the
trial date, prior continuances, prejudice suffered, whether all parties have
stipulated to a continuance, and whether the interests of justice are served.
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).)  

DISCUSSION 
The
trial is currently scheduled for February 26, 2024.  Moving Defendants served their motion for
summary judgment on November 9, 2023. 
Because of the Court’s impacted calendar, the hearing on the summary
judgment motion was scheduled for November 7, 2024, after the February 26, 2024
trial date. 
The
Court finds good cause and grants the motion to continue the trial to a date after
the November 7, 2024 hearing on the summary judgment motion.  The final status conference and all related
discovery and pre-trial dates will be based on the new trial date.

Sinai Health System to continue the trial. 
Trial is continued to December 10, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department 28
