 Case Number:  23STCV21259    Hearing Date:   January 23, 2024    Dept:  28 Claimant
Meir Reichman (“Claimant”) was walking through a crosswalk when he was struck
by the vehicle of Defendant Luis Panis (“Defendant”). Claimant suffered from a
left wrist injury. 
This
is an expedited petition without a hearing, which is permitted under California
Rules of Court, rule 7.950.5, if Petitioner Mitch Reichman (“Petitioner”) uses
the required Judicial Council forms and meets certain conditions. The conditions
are: 
1.
Petitioner is represented by an attorney. 
2.
The claim is not for wrongful death. 
3.
Settlement proceeds will not be placed in a trust. 
4.
There are no unresolved liens. 
5.
Petitioner’s attorney did not become involved at the request of Defendant or
the insurance carrier. 
6.
Petitioner’s attorney is not employed by or associated with a Defendant or
insurance carrier in connection with the petition. 
7.
If an action is filed, all Defendants have appeared and are participating in
the compromise OR the court has determined that the settlement is in good
faith. 
8.
The settlement, exclusive of interests and costs, is $50,000 or less OR if
greater than $50,000, the amount payable is the insurance policy limits AND all
proposed contributing parties would be substantially unable to use assets other
than the insurance policy limits AND the court does not otherwise order. 
PROPOSED SETTLEMENT:
$35,000.00 
INJURIES:
Left wrist injury 
MEDICAL
EXPENSES: $9,568.16 
COSTS:
$941.17 
ATTORNEY’S
FEES: $10,500.00, which is 30% of the proposed gross settlement 
BALANCE
OF PROCEEDS: $20,045.36 
DISCUSSION: 
Section
11b of the petition asks Petitioner to list “[t]he Defendants and amounts offered
by each” to settle the case.  Petitioner
has appropriately listed Defendants John
Philip Ingco Panis and Luis Panis and their offer of $15,000 to settle the
case.  However, Petitioner has also
listed $20,000 for “Meir Reichman (UIMBI & Medical Payments Benefits).”  Meir Reichman is the Claimant, not a Defendant.  The benefits that Claimant will receive from
his own insurance carrier is not a “settlement” amount for purposes of the
petition and should not be included in Section 11b.  Therefore, it appears that the true gross settlement amount is $15,000, the amount that Defendants have offered to pay Claimant to settle the case.
Claimant’s
counsel should calculate attorney’s fees based only on the amount that
Defendants and their insurance carriers will pay to settle the case (i.e.,
$15,000).  Payments from Claimant’s own insurance
carrier to cover Claimant’s medical or other expenses should not be used as a
basis for calculating attorney’s fees. 
Section
13a(1) of the petition states that the total amount of medical expenses was
$9,568.16.  Section 13a(3) states that
the total amount of medical expenses was reduced by $4,510.33 as the result of
negotiated, statutory, and contractual reductions.  The difference between the total amount of
medical expenses and the amount of the reduction (here, $5,057.83) should be
paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.  However, Section 13a(4) of the petition
states that only $613.88 of the medical expenses will be paid or reimbursed from the
settlement proceeds.  This would leave
$4,443.95 of the medical expenses unaccounted for.  The Court cannot approve a petition unless it
reimburses all medical expenses that have not been waived or reimbursed. 
While
Section 13a(4) of the petition states that $613.88 of the medical expenses will
be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds, Section 17b states that $3,513.47
will be paid from the proceeds. 
Section
13a(5) of the petition states that the lien amount is $4,353.95.  However, the attached letter from The Rawlings
Company states that the health plan paid $4,353.95 of the medical expenses but is willing to accept
$2,899.59 to satisfy the health plan's claim for payment.  Therefore, it appears that
the lien amount in Section 13a(5) should be $2,899.59 (which is the amount
listed in Section 13f(2)).
The
Court denies the petition without prejudice.
