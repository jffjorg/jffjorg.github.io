Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion to quash the deposition subpoena served by Costco on Anthem Blue Cross. The subpoena seeks records related to Plaintiff Cynthia Hopes's insurance policy and medical treatment. Plaintiff objects to the subpoena, arguing that it is overbroad, violates her privacy rights, and seeks irrelevant medical information. Costco withdrew the deposition subpoena, but Plaintiff refused to take the motion off calendar. The judge denies the motion as moot, as the deposition subpoena is no longer active.
