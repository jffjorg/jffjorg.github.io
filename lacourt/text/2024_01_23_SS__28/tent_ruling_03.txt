 Case Number:  21STCV21937    Hearing Date:   January 23, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
reviewed Defendant Reynoldo Macapagal Abrenica’s unopposed motions to compel responses
to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and demand for production, the Court rules as follows. 
On
April 27, 2023, Defendant Reynoldo Macapagal Abrenica (“Defendant”) served form
interrogatories, set one, special interrogatories, set one, and demand for production, set one, on Plaintiff Marlon Lee (“Plaintiff”). 
Responses
were due on October 20, 2023. Plaintiff failed to provide timely, verified
responses and had not provided responses by the time Defendant filed these
motions on January 2, 2024. 
The
Court grants Defendant’s motions to compel responses to the form and special
interrogatories under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (b),
and orders Plaintiff to provide verified responses to the form and special
interrogatories compliant with Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.210,
section (a), and 2030.220 without objections by February 22, 2024. 
The
Court grants Defendant’s motion to compel responses to the demand for
production under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 and
orders Plaintiff to provide verified responses compliant with Code of Civil
Procedure section 2031.210 and to produce the documents, electronically stored
information, and/or other things requested without objections by February 22,
2024. 
Defendant
requests $1,311.65 for each motion based on five hours of attorney’s time at a
rate of $250.00 per hour and one $61.65 filing fee.  Counsel spent two hours drafting each motion
and anticipated spending one hour to reply to any opposition and two hours to
attend the hearing. 
The
motions are substantially similar, they are unopposed, and they will be heard
together. The Court awards sanctions of $1,184.95 for all three motions based on four
hours of attorney’s time and three $61.65 filing fees.  (See Code Civ. Proc., §§
2023.030, subd. (a), 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c).) 
The
Court orders Plaintiff Marlon Lee and his counsel to pay Defendant Reynoldo
Macapagal Abrenica $1,184.95 by February 22, 2024. 
Moving
party is to give notice of this ruling.
