LEGAL STANDARD 
Code

“(a) If, after service of a
deposition notice, a party to the action . . . , without having served a valid
objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to
proceed with it, or to produce for
inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing
described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an
order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production
for inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice. 
“(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with
both of the following: 
“(1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the production for inspection of any document, electronically
stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice. 
“(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend
the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored information, or
things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the
petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.  * * *  “(g) (1) If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted,
the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against the
deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. . . .” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,
subds. (a), (b), (g)(1).) 
DISCUSSION 
On May
3, 2023, Plaintiff failed to appear for a noticed deposition without having served
an objection, despite previously agreeing to the date. 
On
September 5, 2023, New Legend served a fourth amended deposition notice,
scheduling Plaintiff’s deposition for September 22, 2023 at 10:00 a.m.  Plaintiff did not serve a written objection to
the notice and did not inform New Legend’s counsel that the deposition would
not go forward.  Plaintiff failed to
appear for the September 22, 2023 deposition. 
New Legend’s counsel emailed and phoned Plaintiff’s counsel to ask about
Plaintiff’s nonappearance at the deposition but was told Plaintiff’s counsel
was unavailable.  New Legend’s counsel
took a certificate of nonappearance. 
The
Court grants the motion. Plaintiff has failed to appear for two noticed
depositions without having served a valid objection. 
New
Legend requests $3,025.00 in sanctions based on 5.5 hours of attorney’s work at
a rate of $550.00 per hour and one $60.00 filing fee.  Counsel spent three hours drafting the motion
and anticipated spending 1.5 hours to prepare a reply and one hour to attend the hearing.  The motion is unopposed. The Court awards $810.00
in sanctions, based on 3 hours of attorney’s time at a reasonable rate of
$250.00 per hour and one filing fee.
