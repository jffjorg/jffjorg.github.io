And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively denied the petition to approve the proposed settlement without prejudice. The petition was filed by Claimant Meir Reichman, who was struck by Defendant Luis Panis's vehicle and suffered a left wrist injury. The proposed settlement amount is $35,000, but the judge finds that the true gross settlement amount is actually $15,000, which is the amount offered by the Defendants to settle the case. The judge also finds that the petition does not comply with the requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 7.950.5, as the Claimant's counsel has listed medical payments benefits as part of the settlement, which is not allowed. Additionally, the judge finds that the petition does not adequately reimburse medical expenses, as the Claimant's counsel has only proposed reimbursing $613.88 of the total medical expenses, leaving $4,443.95 unaccounted for. The judge orders the Claimant's counsel to recalculate the attorney's fees based only on the amount that the Defendants and their insurance carriers will pay to settle the case, and to provide a revised petition that complies with the requirements of the rule and adequately reimburses medical expenses.
