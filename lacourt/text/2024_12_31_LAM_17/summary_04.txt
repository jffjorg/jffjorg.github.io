Summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the unlawful detainer action. The Plaintiff, Wilmington Harbor Properties LP, filed the action against Gabriel McFarlane on April 26, 2024, but it was dismissed on October 8, 2024, for failure to prosecute. The Plaintiff then filed a motion to set aside the dismissal, claiming that the dismissal was due to attorney error. However, the judge ruled that the motion was not accompanied by a proposed new default package, which is required by law, and therefore denied the motion without prejudice. The judge also noted that the Plaintiff's counsel had acknowledged that the case was dismissed due to the failure to submit a new default package, but the motion did not include the missing documentation. The judge relied on California Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b) and the case of Cowan v. Krayzman (2011) in making his ruling.
