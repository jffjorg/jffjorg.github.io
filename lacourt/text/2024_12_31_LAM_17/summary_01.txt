And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to its Requests for Production (RFPs) and Special Interrogatories. The defendant, Southern Motion, failed to provide substantive responses to the requests, citing objections on grounds of privilege, work product, and prematurity. However, the judge found that these objections were unpersuasive and that the requests are relevant and narrowly tailored. The judge ordered Southern Motion to provide further responses to the RFPs and Special Interrogatories and imposed a sanction of $900 per motion, payable within 30 days.
