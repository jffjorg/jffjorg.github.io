And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the Court's previous ruling on the Defendants' motion for leave to conduct discovery. The Plaintiff had argued that the Court's ruling was too broad and that the Defendants should not be allowed to depose the Plaintiff or Mr. Kent without providing all the documents they intend to rely on during the deposition. The Judge has rejected these arguments, stating that there is no requirement for an evidentiary hearing in connection with law and motion practice and that the Plaintiff will have an opportunity to respond and present other evidence if the Defendants file supplemental matters. The Judge has also stated that the deponent is typically required to produce documents, and that the relief granted by the Court is not broader than what was requested by the Defendants. The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion and overruled the objections.
