And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion to compel arbitration in a case involving elder abuse, violation of Patient Bill of Rights, negligence, and wrongful death. The defendants argued that the arbitration agreement should be enforced, while the plaintiffs claimed that it is unenforceable due to lack of capacity, unconscionability, and failure to authenticate the signature of one of the plaintiffs. The judge found that the arbitration agreement includes a clear and unmistakable delegation clause, which allows the arbitrator to determine arbitrability. The judge also found that the plaintiffs failed to establish substantive unconscionability of the delegation clause. As a result, the motion to compel arbitration is granted, and the arbitrator will determine arbitrability. The case is stayed pending the resolution of arbitration.
