Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant Melanie Shornick's motion to strike Plaintiff Xiaofun Sun's complaint as a strategic lawsuit against public participation (SLAPP). The judge finds that the complaint arises from protected activity, specifically Defendant's exercise of her right to petition and free speech in connection with a public issue. The judge also finds that Plaintiff cannot demonstrate a likelihood of prevailing on her claims, as the conduct at issue is shielded by the litigation privilege and there is no evidence that the information was published to others. As a result, the judge orders Defendant to prepare, serve, and submit a proposed judgment. Additionally, the judge awards Defendant her reasonable attorney fees and costs.
