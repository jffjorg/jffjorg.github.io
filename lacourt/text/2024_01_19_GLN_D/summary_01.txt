And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by Lora L. Lococo to appear as counsel pro hac vice for Herc Rental's Inc. in a case. The motion is unopposed, and the judge is satisfied that the paperwork is in order. However, the judge is concerned that Lococo may be making multiple appearances pro hac vice in the state within a short period of time, which may be a problem under CRC Rule 9.40. The judge is asking Lococo to explain why she needs to make multiple appearances and whether there are special circumstances that justify this. If Lococo can provide a satisfactory explanation, the judge may grant the motion. The judge also encourages parties to use audio or video appearances through LACourtConnect if possible.
