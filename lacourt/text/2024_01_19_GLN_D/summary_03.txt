Summary:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay the court action. The defendant, Hyundai Motor America, argued that the matter must be arbitrated pursuant to the arbitration clause in the Sale Contract between the plaintiff, Stacey Taylor, and Glendale Hyundai. However, the judge found that the plaintiff's claims against the manufacturer do not rely on the Sale Contract and therefore equitable estoppel does not apply. The judge also noted that the Ford Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89 Cal.App. 5th 1324 decision, which was recently published, supports the denial of the motion.
