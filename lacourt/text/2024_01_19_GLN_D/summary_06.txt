Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the motion to vacate (cancel) the judgment in this small claims case. The defendant claimed that it did not receive notice of the trial and therefore did not appear at the trial, resulting in a judgment being entered against it. However, the court found that notice was properly given to the defendant and that the defendant's failure to appear was not justified. The court also found that the defendant's claims of lack of notice and reliance on counsel's instructions were not credible. Therefore, the motion to vacate the judgment was denied.
