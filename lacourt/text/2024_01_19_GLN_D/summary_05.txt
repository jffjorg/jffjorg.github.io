And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to set aside a default judgment entered against defendants Wayne Hazle and Mary Ellen Hazle. The defendants seek relief under CCP section 473(b) based on their attorney's mistake in failing to investigate whether a complaint had been filed before the attorney was retained. The court finds that the default judgment was caused by the attorney's mistake and grants the defendants' motion to set aside the default judgment. The court orders the defendants to file and serve an answer to the complaint in substantial conformity with the previously filed answer, and strikes the answer filed on November 2, 2023. The court also notes that the defendants' attorney must take responsibility for the mistake and must show that the mistake was not caused by the clients.
