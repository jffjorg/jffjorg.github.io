And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's request for punitive damages in the First Amended Complaint. The plaintiff, Douglas J. DeNoce, et al., alleged that the defendants, Watergate Property Owners Association, Inc. and S.H. Chavin, Inc. dba Community Property Management, failed to abate a noise-based nuisance that caused the plaintiff to suffer a life-altering stroke. The defendants argued that the plaintiff failed to allege specific facts showing that they acted with malice, oppression, or fraud in building the adjacent parking strips and failing to control and abate the noise. The Judge held that the plaintiff failed to allege sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages and granted the defendant's motion to strike. The plaintiff is given 30 days to amend the complaint, and the Judge set a hearing for the proposed amended complaint.
