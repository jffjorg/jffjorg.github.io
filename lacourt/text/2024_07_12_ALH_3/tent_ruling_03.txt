Plaintiff Dimerco Express USA Corp.
(“Plaintiff”) requests a default judgment against defendant Concord Displays,
LLC (“Defendant”) in the amount of $24,630.97. On May 23, 2042, Plaintiff filed
a declaration of counsel attaching a settlement agreement which provides for
the entry of a stipulated judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
664.6. In light of this agreement, Plaintiff’s attempt to secure a default
judgment is procedurally incorrect. Plaintiff should be moving for entry of a
judgment pursuant to stipulation and submit a proposed judgment that reflects
its stipulated nature. Accordingly, the hearing on the default prove-up is
vacated and the Court sets an OSC re: Dismissal for _____________ in order to
allow Plaintiff time to file a noticed motion.
