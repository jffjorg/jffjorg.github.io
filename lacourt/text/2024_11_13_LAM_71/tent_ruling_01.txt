Plaintiff Grigor Pogosyan’s unopposed motion to compel the deposition of Defendant General Motors, LLC’s
person(s) most knowledgeable is granted.

ruling.
 
          Plaintiff Grigor
Pogosyan (“Pogosyan”) (“Plaintiff”) moves unopposed to compel the
deposition of Defendant General Motors, LLC’s (“GM”) (“Defendant”) Person(s) Most Knowledgeable (“PMK”).  (Notice of Motion, pg. 1; C.C.P. §2025.450(a).)

alleging three causes of action: (1) breach of implied warranty; (2) breach of
express warranty; and (3) violation of the Song Beverly Consumer Warranty Act
(“Song-Beverly”).  (See Complaint.)
On May 28, 2024, Plaintiff served a Notice of Deposition of Defendant’s
PMK, with the deposition to take place on June 20, 2024.  (Decl. of Korn ¶5, Exh. A.)  On June 12, 2024, Defendant served a list of
objections to the Notice of Deposition. 
(Decl. of Korn ¶5, Exh. B.) 
Therefore, the deposition did not proceed.
On July 16, 2024, Plaintiff scheduled the deposition of Defendant’s
PMK for August 8, 2024.  (Decl. of Korn ¶7,
Exh. D.)  On July 30, 2024, Defendant
served a list of objections to the Notice of Deposition.  (Decl. of Korn ¶7, Exh. E.)
On August 8, 2024, despite timely noticing the deposition of
Defendant’s PMK, and Plaintiff was forced to take a Certificate of
Non-Appearance.  (Decl. of Korn ¶8, Exh.
F.)
On September 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion.  As
of the date of this hearing no opposition has been filed.
The Court grants Plaintiff’s motion
pursuant to C.C.P. §2025.450 and orders Defendant’s PMK to appear for deposition
within 20 days.  Plaintiff has
demonstrated good cause to order Defendant to produce a PMK witness.
Moving Party is to give notice of this ruling.

motion to compel the deposition of Defendant’s PMK is granted.  Defendant is to produce its PMK for
deposition within 20 days of this ruling.
