Complaint for unlawful detainer filed in LASC Case No. 23SMUD00496 (D-RJN, Exh.
1); (2) Unlawful Detainer Stipulation filed June 8, 2023, signed by Judge Mark
A. Borenstein (D-RJN, Exh. 2); (3) Court’s Minute Order of June 8, 2023 (D-RJN,

Judgment of August 30, 2023 (D-RJN, Exh. 5), is granted.
 
Meet and Confer
Before filing a
demurrer, the demurring party must meet and confer in person, by telephone,
or by video conference with the party who filed the pleading to attempt to
reach an agreement that would resolve the objections to the pleading and
obviate the need for filing the demurrer.  (C.C.P. §430.41(a), emphasis added.)
The demurring party
shall file and serve with the demurrer a declaration stating either of the
following: (A) The means by which the demurring party met and conferred with
the party who filed the pleading subject to demurrer, and that the parties did
not reach an agreement resolving the objections raised in the demurrer. (B)
That the party who filed the pleading subject to demurrer failed to respond to
the meet and confer request of the demurring party or otherwise failed to meet
and confer in good faith.  (C.C.P.
§430.41(a)(3).)
Moving Defendant’s
counsel submitted a meet and confer declaration stating that she met and
conferred with Plaintiff telephonically on August 9, 2024.  (See Decl. of
Windler ¶2.)  Moving
Defendant’s counsel declares she explained to Plaintiff the defects in the
complaint and the parties were not able to come to an agreement on the
pleadings.  (See Decl. of Windler
¶2.)  Accordingly, the Court will
consider Moving Defendant’s demurrer.
 
Background
Plaintiff filed his initial Complaint on March 27, 2024, against
Moving Defendant and Non-moving Defendants Winston Cenac, Trustee of the Island
Boy Trust (“Cenac”), Shelby Ring (“Ring”), the Law Offices of Rebecca Hufford-Cohen
(“Law Offices”), and On Time (“On Time”) (collectively, “Defendants”) alleging
four causes of action: (1) illegal eviction; (2) illegal theft; (3)
discrimination; and (4) fraud.  On July
15, 2024, this Court sustained Moving Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s
Complaint.  (7/15/24 Minute Order.)
On August 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed the operative FAC alleging seven
causes of action: (1) wrongful eviction; (2) discrimination in violation of
FEHA; (3) breach of contract; (4) conversion; (5) negligence; (6) fraud and
misrepresentation; and (7) intentional infliction of emotional distress.
Plaintiff alleges he entered into a rental agreement with Cenac for
a studio apartment located at 238 1/2 Market St, Venice, CA.  (FAC ¶2.) 
Plaintiff alleges he was charged disproportionately high rent compared
to other tenants and faced not only financial strain but also suspected
discrimination based on his ethnicity.  (FAC ¶2.) 
Plaintiff alleges throughout his tenancy he fulfilled all rental
obligations, maintaining the property in good condition despite facing numerous
habitability issues including severe mold contamination and unrepaired water
damage-issues that Cenac repeatedly failed to address adequately.  (FAC ¶2.)  
Plaintiff alleges
that in February 2023, the dispute between the Plaintiff and Cenac escalated
when Cenac falsely alleged unpaid rent and initiated an eviction claim.  (FAC ¶3.)  Plaintiff alleges he countered these claims
with proof of payment, yet the challenges persisted.  (FAC ¶3.)  Plaintiff alleges the situation worsened in
July 2023 when Cenac, under the guise of another eviction attempt, falsely claimed
non-payment.  (FAC ¶3.)  Plaintiff alleges despite his compliance,
evidenced by bank records showing timely rent payments, the eviction process
moved forward.  (FAC ¶3.)  Plaintiff alleges this premature legal action
ignored the facts and aimed to dispossess the Plaintiff unjustly.  (FAC ¶3.)  
Plaintiff alleges
after the property changed hands in late July 2023, the new owner, Moving
Defendant 90018 Collection LLC, began extensive renovations without proper
notification to the tenants, disrupting their living conditions and violating
multiple tenancy and building codes.  (FAC
¶4.)  Plaintiff alleges in November 2023,
in a distressing turn of events, law enforcement officials forcibly removed the
Plaintiff from his home on an improperly executed order, leaving him without
residence and immediate access to his personal belongings.  (FAC ¶4.)  Plaintiff alleges this action, devoid of prior
notice or justification, was not only traumatic but also obliterated the
Plaintiff’s ability to conduct his remote work, directly impacting his
livelihood.  (FAC ¶4.)
Plaintiff alleges
that on November 9, 2023, he was a tenant at 238 ½ Market Street, Venice, California
90291, and was subjected to an eviction by the sheriff. (FAC ¶¶92-95.)  Plaintiff alleges that outside, Jason Panneton
was waiting, and Shelby Ring was also present, though at a distance.  (FAC ¶95.) 
Plaintiff alleges one of the sheriffs handed Panneton the keys, stating
he now had possession back.  (FAC
¶95.)  Plaintiff alleges the paperwork
Panneton held listed the name and address of Rebecca Hufford-Cohen but did not
mention 90018 Collection LLC.  (FAC
¶95.)  Plaintiff alleges neither Cenac
nor any of his employees or representatives were present, and 90018 Collection
LLC had not notified the Plaintiff about the lockout before it was enforced by
the sheriffs. (FAC ¶95.) 
Plaintiff alleges
on November 28, 2021, his personal property was removed without his consent.  (See FAC ¶167.) Plaintiff alleges that
before the sale to Defendant 90018, he fulfilled all payments due to the
landlord Cenac by July 24, 2023, as outlined in a stipulation agreement he had
with Cenac.  (See FAC ¶¶50-53,
68.) 
Plaintiff alleges
Cenac filed an ex parte that alleged non-payment and included a misleading
hearing notice that led to an erroneous judgment.  (FAC ¶¶57, 60.)
Plaintiff alleges
that following the eviction, Moving Defendant 90018 and Non-moving Defendant
Panneton initiated major reconstruction without permits from the Los Angeles
Housing Authority and displaced Plaintiff and violated the health rights of
tenants.  (FAC ¶¶14, 71-73, 189.)

Moving Defendant filed the instant demurrer on September 3,
2024.  Plaintiff filed his opposition on October
29, 2024.  Defendant filed its reply on
October 31, 2024.
          
A.  
Demurrer
Summary of Demurrer
Moving Defendant demurs to Plaintiff’s FAC on the grounds that the
entire FAC and each cause of action alleged therein fails to state facts on
which relief may be granted and is uncertain. 
(Demurrer, pgs. 2-3; C.C.P. §§430.10(e), (f).)
 
Legal Standard
“[A] demurrer tests the legal
sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc.
(2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  A
demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable.  (See Donabedian v.
Mercury Insurance Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a
demurrer, a court may not consider declarations, matters not subject to
judicial notice, or documents not accepted for the truth of their
contents].)  For purposes of ruling on a
demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed to be true, but the
reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of law.  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital District
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
 
Failure to State a Claim
Wrongful Eviction (1st COA)
          California
recognizes the tort of wrongful eviction.  (See Barkett v. Brucato (1953) 122
Cal.App.2d 264, 275.)  “An essential
element of a wrongful eviction claim is that the tenant has vacated the
premises. [Citations.]”  (Ginsberg v.
Gamson (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 873, 900.)
The elements of a cause of action in tort for wrongful eviction
are (1) the tenant has property rights and privileges with regard to the use or
enjoyment that has been interfered with; (2) there has been a substantial
invasion of those rights or privileges; (3) the conduct
of the landlord is the legal cause of the invasion of the tenant’s rights or
privileges; and (4) the invasion is intentional and unreasonable, or unintentional
and otherwise actionable under the rules governing liability for negligent, reckless
or ultrahazardous conduct.  (Tooke v. Allen
(1948) 85 Cal.App.2d 230, 237.)
Plaintiff fails to allege Moving Defendant is the landlord of 238
½ Market Street, Venice, CA 90291; factual allegations that Moving Defendant
substantially invaded his rights as a tenant; that Moving Defendant as the
landlord was the legal cause of the invasion of Plaintiff’s rights or
privileges as a tenant; and that Moving Defendant’s invasion was intentional
and unreasonable, or unintentional and otherwise actionable under the
rules governing liability for negligent, reckless or ultrahazardous conduct.
Further, Moving Defendant was not a party to
the unlawful detainer action, LASC Case No. 23SMUD00496.  (D-RJN, Exhs. 1-5.)  Moving Defendant’s predecessor in interest,
Cenac, filed the unlawful detainer action at issue against Plaintiff.   (See D-RJN, Exh. 1.)  The unlawful detainer court, having found
Plaintiff to be in breach of its agreement with then-owner Cenac, adjudicated
that Plaintiff could be evicted from the apartment unit at the property.  (D-RJN, Exh. 4.)  Thereafter, the unlawful detainer court
entered judgment in favor of Cenac. 
(D-RJN, Exh. 5.)
          Accordingly,
Moving Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s 1st cause of action is sustained without
leave to amend.
 
Discrimination (2nd COA)
The elements of the cause of action for housing discrimination are:
(1) Plaintiff was a member of a protected class; (2) applied for and was qualified
for a housing accommodation; (3) was denied a housing accommodation; and (4) circumstantial
evidence of discriminatory motive, such as similarly situated individuals
applied for and obtained housing.  (Department
of Fair Employment and Housing v. Superior Court (2002) 99
Cal.App.4th 896, 902.)
Plaintiff fails to allege the protected class he belongs to for
which Moving Defendant based its impermissible decision to deny Plaintiff’s
application for a housing accommodation. 
Plaintiff fails to allege he applied to Moving Defendant and was
qualified for a housing accommodation. 
Plaintiff fails to allege circumstantial evidence of a discriminatory
motive by Moving Defendant against him. 
Further, Plaintiff fails to allege he filed a complaint with the
Department of Fair Employment and Housing (“DFEH”) against Moving Defendant
prior to filing the instant action.  (See
Govt. Code §12980(h).)
Accordingly, Moving Defendant’s demurrer to the 3rd cause of
action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.

 
          Breach
of Contract (3rd COA)
          Plaintiff
was not granted leave to amend his initial Complaint to add a cause of action
for breach of contract in his FAC. 
Accordingly, the Court will address this cause of action in its sua
sponte motion to strike.
          
Conversion (4th COA)
Conversion is the wrongful exercise of dominion over the property
of another. The elements of a conversion claim are: (1) the plaintiff’s
ownership or right to possession of the property; (2) the defendant’s
conversion by a wrongful act or disposition of property rights; and (3)
damages.  (Lee v. Hanley (2015) 61
Cal.4th 1225, 1240.)
To prove a cause of action for conversion, the plaintiff must show
the defendant acted intentionally to wrongfully dispose of the property of
another.  (Duke v. Superior Court (2017)
18 Cal.App.5th 490, 508.)
“[C]onversion is a strict liability tort. It does not require bad
faith, knowledge, or even negligence; it requires only that the defendant have
intentionally done the act depriving the plaintiff of his or her rightful
possession.” (Voris v. Lampert (2019) 7 Cal.5th 1141, 1158.)
In the stipulation filed in the unlawful detainer action with
Cenac (and not Moving Defendant) Plaintiff agreed that he “may take
possession/dispose of [personal property] after the Vacate Date . . . [and that
any] items left in the unit shall be deemed abandoned. [Plaintiff Jegede]
waive[d] any right to remove [his] property after the lock out.”  (D-RJN, Exh. 2 at Attachment A ¶4.)  Plaintiff agreed to vacate the Subject
Premises by August 31, 2023, “removing all personal property and persons.”  (D-RJN, Exh. 2 at pg. 1.)  At the ex parte hearing on the motion to
enforce settlement in the unlawful detainer matter, Judge Bornstein determined
that Plaintiff breached the terms of the stipulation he made with Cenac and
thereafter, Judge Bornstein granted Cenac’s motion to enforce the settlement,
restoring possession of the Subject Premises to Cenac.  (D-RJN, Exh. 4.)  Plaintiff’s FAC is not the proper mechanism
to relitigate Judge Bornstein’s ruling on the unlawful detainer proceedings.  Instead, a timely appeal of the unlawful
detainer proceedings would have been the proper mechanism to challenge any possible
procedural defects.
Accordingly, Moving Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s 4th cause
of action is sustained without leave to amend.
 
          Negligence (5th
COA)
Plaintiff was not granted leave to amend his
initial Complaint to add a cause of action for negligence in his FAC.  Accordingly, the Court will address this
cause of action in its sua sponte motion to strike.
 
Fraud (6th COA)
“A complaint for fraud must allege the following elements: (1) a
knowingly false representation by the defendant; (2) an intent to deceive or
induce reliance; (3) justifiable reliance by the plaintiff; and (4) resulting
damages.” (Service by Medallion, Inc. v. Clorox Co. (1996) 44
Cal.App.4th 1807, 1816 [combining misrepresentation and scienter as a single
element].)
Fraud actions are subject to strict requirements of particularity
in pleading.  (Committee on Children’s
Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 216.)  Fraud must be pleaded with specificity rather
than with general and conclusory allegations.  (Small v. Fritz Companies, Inc. (2003)
30 Cal.4th 167, 184.)  The specificity
requirement means a plaintiff must allege facts showing
how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were made,
and, in the case of a corporate defendant, the plaintiff must allege the names
of the persons who made the representations, their authority to speak on behalf
of the corporation, to whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when the
representation was made.  (Lazar
v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645; West v. JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 780, 793.)
Plaintiff fails to allege a knowingly false representation by Moving
Defendant, an intent to deceive or induce reliance, and justifiable reliance by
the plaintiff.  Further, Plaintiff fails
to allege facts showing how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the
representations were made, and, in the case of a corporate defendant, the
plaintiff must allege the names of the persons who made the representations,
their authority to speak on behalf of the corporation, to whom they spoke, what
they said or wrote, and when the representation was made.
Accordingly, Moving Defendant’s demurrer to the 4th cause of
action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
 
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (7th COA)
Plaintiff was not granted leave to amend his
initial Complaint to add a cause of action for intentional infliction of
emotional distress in his FAC. 
Accordingly, the Court will address this cause of action in its sua
sponte motion to strike.
 
Conclusion
Moving Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s FAC is sustained without
leave to amend as to the 1st and 4th causes of action and is sustained with
20 days leave to amend as to the 2nd and 6th causes of action.
The Court does not address Plaintiff’s 3rd, 5th, and 7th causes of
action in this demurrer and addresses these causes of action in its sua
sponte motion to strike.
Moving Party to give notice.
 
B.   
The Court’s sua sponte Motion to Strike
Legal Standard
C.C.P. §436 provides that the Court
may, upon a motion made pursuant to C.C.P. §435, or at any time within its
discretion and upon terms it deems proper, “strike out any irrelevant, false,
or improper matter inserted in any pleading” and/or “strike out all or part of
any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a
court rule, or an order of the court.” A motion to strike should be applied
cautiously and sparingly because it is used to strike substantive
defects.  (PH II, Inc. v. Superior Court (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th
1680, 1683.)  The grounds for a motion to
strike must appear on the face of the pleading under attack, or from matter
which the court may judicially notice.  (C.C.P.
§437.)
“A court is not required to tolerate
purported amended complaint that fails to amend previous pleading, is not filed
in good faith, is filed in disregard of established procedural requirements,
or is otherwise violative or orderly judicial administration.”  (Tostevin v. Douglas (1958) 160
Cal.App.2d 321, 331, quoting Neal v. Bank of America National Trust &
Savings Association (1949) 93 Cal.App.2d 678, 682-683, emphasis added.)  
This court, by its own motion strikes
Plaintiff’s 3rd cause of action in the FAC exceeds the scope of this Court’s
granting of leave to amend.  The original
Complaint contained four causes of action: (1) illegal eviction; (2) illegal theft; (3) discrimination; and
(4) fraud. The Complaint was challenged by Defendant’s demurrer.  This Court sustained Moving Defendant’s
demurrer to all four causes of action with leave to amend. 
Plaintiff’s operative FAC alleges seven causes of action: (1) wrongful eviction; (2) discrimination
in violation of FEHA; (3) breach of contract; (4) conversion; (5) negligence;
(6) fraud and misrepresentation; and (7) intentional infliction of emotional
distress.  Plaintiff was not granted
leave to add the additional causes of action for breach of contract (3rd),
negligence (5th), or intentional infliction of emotional distress (7th).
Accordingly, the 3rd, 5th, and 7th
causes of action in Plaintiff’s FAC are improperly pled in violation of this
Court’s order and must be stricken.   (See
7/15/24 Ruling; C.C.P. §436(b).)
Accordingly, the Court, sua sponte, strikes Plaintiff’s 3rd, 5th,
and 7th causes of action in Plaintiff’s FAC.
 
Conclusion
The court, sua sponte, strikes
Plaintiff’s 3rd, 5th, and 7th causes of action in Plaintiff’s FAC.
Plaintiff to give notice.
