The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case between Luis M Meza Marantes (Plaintiff) and Antonio Campa et al. (Defendants). The Judge denies the Plaintiff's default judgment packet and sets a hearing on an order to show cause why the complaint should not be dismissed and/or the Plaintiff's counsel should be sanctioned $250 for failing to enter default judgment. The Judge's decision is based on several reasons, including the fact that not all exhibits included with the Plaintiff's declaration are properly authenticated, Exhibit 3 to the Plaintiff's declaration is not legible, the Plaintiff has not shown liability as to each defendant, and the recovery is not duplicative. Additionally, the Judge notes that the Plaintiff's Complaint includes a contract between Cal-City Construction Inc. and Marentes Construction, signed by Marentes Construction, which is not made with any of the named Defendants.
