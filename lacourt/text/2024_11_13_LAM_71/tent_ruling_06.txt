Background
On July 30, 2012, default judgment was entered
by the Court in favor of Judgment Creditor against Judgment Debtor Susana
Mendoza.  (7/30/12 Judgment.)  On February 10, 2014, Judgment Creditor filed
an acknowledgment with this Court that he assigned his right, title, and
interest in the judgment, consisting of the unpaid amount of $8,835.50 to
Assignee of Record.  (2/10/14
Acknowledgment of Assignment of Judgment.)
On October 1, 2020, the California Secretary of
State suspended the Assignee of Record’s powers and privileges of for
nonpayment of taxes to the Franchise Tax Board. 
(Decl. of Garcia ¶4, Exh. 1.)
Judgment Creditor filed the instant motion on
August 16, 2024.  As of the date of this
hearing no opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
An assignee may become the assignee of record
by filing an acknowledgment of assignment with the clerk of the court that
entered the judgment.  (C.C.P. §673(a).)  The acknowledgment must be made in the same
manner as an acknowledgment of a real property conveyance.  (C.C.P. §673(c).)  It must be executed and acknowledged by the
judgment creditor or by the prior assignee of record (if any).  (C.C.P. §673(c).)
Revenue
and Tax Code §23301 provides:
Except for the purposes of
filing an application for exempt status or amending the articles of
incorporation or organization as necessary either to perfect that application
or to set forth a new name, the powers, rights and privileges of a domestic
taxpayer may be suspended, and the exercise of the powers, rights and
privileges of a foreign taxpayer in this state may be forfeited, if any of
the following conditions occur:
(a)   If any tax, penalty, or interest, or any
portion thereof, that is due and payable under Chapter 4 (commencing with
Section 19001) of Part 10.2, or under this part, either at the time the return
is required to be filed or on or before the 15th day of the ninth month
following the close of the taxable year, is not paid on or before 6 p.m. on the
last day of the 12th month after the close of the taxable year.
(b)   If any tax, penalty, or interest, or any
portion thereof, due and payable under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
19001) of Part 10.2, or under this part, upon notice and demand from the
Franchise Tax Board, is not paid on or before 6 p.m. on the last day of the
11th month following the due date of the tax.
(c)   If any liability, or any portion thereof,
which is due and payable under Article 7 (commencing with Section 19131) of
Chapter 4 of Part 10.2, is not paid on or before 6 p.m. on the last day of the
11th month following the date that the tax liability is due and payable.
 
(Rev.
& Tax Code §23301, emphasis added.)
 
Discussion
On October 1, 2020, the California Secretary of
State suspended the Assignee of Record’s powers and privileges of for
nonpayment of taxes to the Franchise Tax Board.  (Decl. of Garcia ¶4, Exh. 1.)  As a result, Assignee of Record is now
legally unable to collect or enforce the judgment on Judgment Creditor’s
behalf.  (See Rev. & Tax. Code
§23301; Reed v. Norman (1957) 48 Cal.2d 338, 342; Bourhis v. Lord
(2013) 56 Cal.4th 320, 324; Color-Vue, Inc. v. Abrams (1996) 44
Cal.App.4th 1599, 1603-1604; Cal-Western Business Services, Inc. v. Corning
Capital Group (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 304.)
Assignee of Record has refused to reassign the
judgment back to Judgment Creditor despite multiple demands.  (Decl. of Garcia ¶¶3-8.)
Jurisdiction over the subject matter and the
parties is effective both before and after entry of judgment in the action.  This Court has inherent equitable and
statutory powers and jurisdiction to enforce and compel obedience to its
judgments, orders, and process.  (C.C.P.
§§128(a)(4), 177, 187, 410.50; Security Trust & Savings Bank v. Southern
Pacific Railroad Co. (1935) 6 Cal.App.2d 585, 588; Brown v. Brown
(1971) 22 Cal.App.3d 82, 84; Blueberry Properties, LLC v. Chow (2014)
230 Cal.App.4th 1017, 1020-1021; Goldman v. Simpson (2008) 160
Cal.App.4th 255, 263-264; Tide Water Associated Oil Co. v. Superior Court
(1955) 43 Cal.2d 815, 825; Phillips, Spallas & Angstadt, LLP v. Fotouhi
(2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 1132, 1142-1143; Yolanda’s, Inc. v. Kahl & Goveia
Commerical Real Estate (2017) 11 Cal.App.5th 509, 514; Estrada v.
Royalty Carpet Mills, Inc. (2024) 15 Cal.App.5th 582, 597-598; Torjesen
v. Mansdorf (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 111, 118.)
Here, Assignee of Record’s refusal to reassign
Judgment Creditor’s judgment back to him for enforcement constitutes a breach
of its fiduciary duty to Judgment Creditor. 
(See Cross v. Bonded Adjustment Bureau (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 266,
276-277.)  Under such circumstances, this
Court is within its authority to issue an order reassigning the judgment back
to Judgment Creditor.  Judgment Creditor
cannot enforce his judgment until it is reassigned back to him. If the judgment
is not reassigned back to Judgment Creditor, it will be null and void in
effect.
Accordingly, Judgment Creditor’s motion is
granted.
 
Conclusion
Judgment Creditor’s unopposed motion to
reassign the judgment in this matter from Ex Parte Collection Services, LLC,
back to Judgment Creditor is granted.
Moving Party to give notice.
