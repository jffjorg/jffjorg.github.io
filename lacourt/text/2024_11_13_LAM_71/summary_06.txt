And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the motion of Judgment Creditor Alfredo Garcia to reassign the judgment in the matter from Ex Parte Collection Services, LLC, back to him is granted. The judgment was assigned to Ex Parte Collection Services, LLC in 2014, but the company's powers and privileges were suspended in 2020 due to nonpayment of taxes to the Franchise Tax Board. Despite multiple demands, Ex Parte Collection Services, LLC has refused to reassign the judgment back to Judgment Creditor. The judge finds that Ex Parte Collection Services, LLC has breached its fiduciary duty to Judgment Creditor and that the judgment is no longer enforceable in its current form. Therefore, the judge orders the judgment to be reassigned back to Judgment Creditor, allowing him to enforce the judgment and collect the unpaid amount of $8,835.50.
