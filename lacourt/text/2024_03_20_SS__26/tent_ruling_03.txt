ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Daniel Lupa-Chazan (“Plaintiff”) propounded Form
Interrogatories, Set One, and Requests for Admission, Set One, on Defendant Alicia Garcia (“Defendant Alicia”) on January
8, 2024. (Motions, Lupa-Chazan Decl., ¶2.) Plaintiff filed the instant (1)
Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request For
Sanctions; and (2) Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for
Admission, Set One, Admitted, and Request For Sanctions on February 13, 2024.
Defendant Alicia filed oppositions on March 6, 2024 and Plaintiff replied on
March 12, 2024. 
 
Discussion
 
Defendant Alicia served responses to the Form
Interrogatories, Set One, on February 7, 2024. (Id. at Exh. A.) The
Motion to Compel Responses is brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2030.290, which pertains to initial responses. Plaintiff argues that
the responses are tantamount to no response at all because they were not
verified but also admits that they contain objections. (Citing Appleton v.
Superior Court (1988), 206 Cal.App.3d 632.) Responses containing objections
need not be verified. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.250, subd. (a).) The responses
to Form Interrogatory, Set One, Nos. 102.4, 102.5, 102.9, 102.10, 102.11,
115.2, 120.1, 120.3, 120.5, 120.8., therefore, did not have to be verified to
be Code-compliant responses. An order compelling responses to Form
Interrogatory, Set One, is granted only as to No. 101.1.
 
Defendant Alicia served responses to the Requests for
Admission, Set One, on February 7, 2024. (Id. at Exh. A.) The Motion to Compel
Responses is brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.290,
which pertains to further responses. A motion to compel further responses must
be accompanied by a separate statement. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd.
(a)(2).) The motion is not accompanied by a separate statement, as required.
Regarding the merits, Plaintiff again argues that the responses are tantamount
to no response at all because they were not verified but also admits that they
contain objections. (Citing Appleton v. Superior Court (1988), 206
Cal.App.3d 632.) As previously explained, responses containing objections need
not be verified. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.240, subd. (a).) The responses to
Requests for Admission, Set One, Nos. 1-14, therefore, did not have to be
verified to be Code-compliant responses. An order compelling responses to
Request for Admission, Set One, is denied.
 
In light of the ruling predominately denying these motions,
Plaintiff’s requests for sanctions are also denied. 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Daniel Lupa-Chazan’s (1) Motion to Compel Responses to
Form Interrogatories, Set One, and for Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED SOLELY AS
TO NO. 101.1; (2) Motion to Compel Responses to Requests for Admission, Set One,
and for Monetary Sanctions is DENIED.
