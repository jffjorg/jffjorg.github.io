And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the Upper Westwood Homeowner's Association (HOA) to the complaint filed by Hector Mercado. The HOA argues that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute causes of action and that it cannot be ascertained whether the contracts are written, oral, or implied by conduct. The judge agrees with the HOA's demurrer and sustains it, finding that the complaint does not provide sufficient information to support the causes of action against the HOA. The judge orders the plaintiff to provide an offer of proof if they request leave to amend the complaint. The case will be heard on November 2, 2023.
