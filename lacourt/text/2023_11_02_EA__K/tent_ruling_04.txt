Damages and Specific Performance
On January 29, 2021, an “Order
Granting Motion for Summary Adjudication of Issues” was filed; that same day,
the court was notified that Sagar had died on January 17, 2021.
On February 24, 2021, Plaintiffs filed an “Amendment to Complaint,”

matter to Judge Wesley Hsu for trial purposes only.
On April 10, 2023, the Judgment on Special Verdict was filed. On April
17, 2023, Coleman filed (and mail-served) a “Notice of Entry of Judgment.” On
April 28, 2023, Coleman filed a “Memorandum of Costs.”
On July 3, 2023, Coleman filed a “Notice of Appeal.” On September 6,
2023, Kilci filed a “Notice of Cross-Appeal.”
Legal Standard
In general, the
“prevailing party” is “entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any
action or proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (b).) The phrase
“prevailing party” includes “the party with a net monetary recovery, a
defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered, a defendant where neither
plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief, and a defendant as against those
plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against that defendant.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).)
Code of Civil Procedure § 1034,
subdivision (a) states that “[p]rejudgment costs . . . shall be claimed and
contested in accordance with rules adopted by the Judicial Council.” A
prevailing party claiming costs must serve and file a memorandum of costs. (California
Rules of Court (“CRC”) rule 3.1700, subd. (a)(1).) “The memorandum of costs
must be verified by a statement of the party, attorney, or agent that to the
best of his or her knowledge the items of cost are correct and were necessarily
incurred in the case.” (Id.) The
contesting party may dispute any or all of the items in the prevailing party’s
memorandum of costs by a motion to strike or tax costs. (CRC rule 3.1700, subd.
(b).)
“If items on their face appear to be
proper charges, the verified memorandum of costs is prima facie evidence of
their propriety, and the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show
they were not reasonable or necessary. On the other hand, if items are properly
objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on the party
claiming them as costs. However, whether a cost item was reasonably necessary
is still a question of fact to be decided by the trial court. (Jones v. Dumrichob (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th
1258, 1266 [internal quotations and citations omitted].) “Initial
verification will suffice to establish the reasonable necessity of the costs
claimed. There is no requirement that copies of bills, invoices, statements, or
any other such documents be attached to the memorandum. Only if the costs have
been put in issue via a motion to tax costs must supporting documentation be
submitted.” (Id. at 1267.)
Discussion

Kilci moves
the court for an order, per California Rules of Court Rule 3.1700, taxing Coleman’s
memorandum of costs as to the following items: (8) witness
fees (i.e., $186,162.00 of the $186,480.04 in total requested) and (16) other
(i.e., $108,925.90 of the $112,411.63 in total requested)
1.                 
Witness Fees (i.e., Item No. 8)
Expert fees may
be awarded pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 1033.5, subdivision (b) when
expressly
provided for by law. Kilci seeks to tax the entirety of Coleman’s request for
$186,162.00 in expert witness fees pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure § 998.
Code of Civil Procedure § 998, subdivision (d) provides that
“[i]f an
offer made by a plaintiff is not accepted and the defendant fails to obtain a
more favorable judgment or award in any action or proceeding other than an
eminent domain action, the court or arbitrator, in its discretion, may require
the defendant to pay a reasonable sum to cover postoffer costs of the services
of expert witnesses, who are not regular employees of any party, actually
incurred and reasonably necessary in either, or both, preparation for trial or
arbitration, or during trial or arbitration, of the case by the plaintiff, in
addition to plaintiff's costs.”
Coleman attached a copy
of an “Offer to Compromise Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, Section 998”
dated October 19, 2016, in which Coleman offered to compromise the proceeding
by allowing judgment to be entered against Sagar only and in Coleman’s favor in
the amount of $100,000.00. Kilci’s counsel Ronald Zurek (“Zurek”) acknowledges
that Coleman served a section 998 offer on October 19, 2016 (Zurek Decl., ¶ 2,
Exh. A), but provides evidence that Plaintiff withdrew same on November 18,
2016, before the 30 days had expired.[1]
(Id., ¶ 3, Exhs. B and C.)
Kilci points out
that when Coleman withdrew her statutory offer, Coleman’s counsel concurrently
sent a letter to Zurek which makes reference to a “counter” having been made.
Kilci argues that Coleman cannot assert that a defense request to settle the
case by use of a release and dismissal instead of a formal pleading acceptance
constituted a counter-offer which functioned as a rejection thereby terminating
Coleman’s offer. (See Poster v. Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Dist. (1990)
52 Cal.3d 266, 272 [“The legislative purpose of section 998 is better served by
the bright line rule adopted by the Court of Appeal in this case, under which a
section 998 offer is not revoked by a counteroffer and may be accepted by the
offeree during the statutory period unless the offer has been revoked by the
offeror. . .”].) Coleman does
not make any such assertion and, in fact, opposes the motion entirely on the
basis that it is untimely.[2]
The court determines
that Item No. 8 should be taxed in the amount of $186,162.00.
2.                 
“Other”
Fees (i.e., Item No. 16)
Kilci seeks to tax Coleman’s
request for prejudgment interest of $94,660.00 as “[i]nterest on CCP 998.”
Since Coleman is not entitled to recover section 998 costs, she is not entitled
to recover any interest on section 998 costs.
Kilci also seeks to
tax Coleman’s request to recover three different amounts (i.e., for $1,350.00,
$2,125.00 and $2,450) for the cost of mediation. Although mediation costs can
be recoverable in the court’s discretion pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §
1033.5, subdivision (c)(4), the court declines to award them here. The court will hear from counsel on this
issue.
Finally, Kilci seeks
to tax Coleman’s request for “Trial- Air BNB” costs of $5,666.00 and “Trial-
Assistant” costs of $2,675.00 as unauthorized. The court agrees: Code of Civil
Procedure § 1033.5, subdivision (a)(3)(C) allows for travel expenses “to attend
depositions,” not for trial. At any rate, allowable costs must be “reasonably
necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or
beneficial to its preparation.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(2).) As
Kilci states, “making the choice to incur expensive lodging just in order to
avoid Los Angeles County traffic during the day was truly not reasonably
necessary in order for plaintiff and her lawyer to try the case.” (Motion,
3:26-4:1).
Conclusion
The court grants Kilci’s
motion in full.
