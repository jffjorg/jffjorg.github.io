And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff to respond to special interrogatories. The plaintiff failed to respond to the interrogatories, which were served on December 14, 2023. The judge notes that the interrogatories are questionable at best and likely objectionable, but the plaintiff did not object or respond. The judge finds that the defendant has met its burden to show that the plaintiff failed to respond, and therefore grants the motion to compel. The judge also denies the defendant's request for sanctions, as the plaintiff has not made any argument against the sanctions. The judge orders the plaintiff to provide code-compliant, written, verified responses to the special interrogatories within 21 days.
