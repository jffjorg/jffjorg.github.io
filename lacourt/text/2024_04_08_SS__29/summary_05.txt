And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court rules that the defendants' motions to compel plaintiff Joseph Safdeye to respond to discovery requests are granted. The plaintiff failed to respond to defendants' Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Production, which were served on January 12, 2023. The court orders the plaintiff to provide written, verified, code-compliant responses to the discovery requests within 21 days of notice. The court also denies the defendants' request for sanctions against the plaintiff. The court finds that the plaintiff's failure to respond to discovery requests was due to his illness and that an award of sanctions would be unjust.
