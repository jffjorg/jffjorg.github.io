 Case Number:  21STCV23990    Hearing Date:   April 8, 2024    Dept:  29 The Court will hear from counsel on all  issues relating to the pending motion, including on the following issues. First, in its reply papers, Bosch presented  evidence from its employee Mr. Hudnut and its investigator Mr. Rowe stating (in  effect) that they attended a joint inspection of the scene on September 19, 2019,  and no one told them that any evidence would be discarded, destroyed, or otherwise  not maintained.  Because this evidence  came in with the reply, the Court continued the hearing and gave State Farm the  opportunity to respond, by way of a sur-reply.   In the sur-reply, State Farm’s investigator Mr. Koster states (in  effect) that Bosch did not request that the refrigerator be preserved, and that  if Bosch had made such a request, it would have been honored. Does either side contest these facts?  How do these facts apply to the spoliation  argument? Second, State Farm argues (in effect) that  there was no spoliation because there is no “substantial probability” that  Bosch’s case was damaged or impaired by the destruction of the  refrigerator.  What is Bosch’s response? Third, Bosch seeks (among other things)  terminating sanctions.  If the Court  determines that spoliation occurred and that some level of sanction is, why is a  terminating sanction appropriate on these facts (as opposed to a lesser  sanction)?
