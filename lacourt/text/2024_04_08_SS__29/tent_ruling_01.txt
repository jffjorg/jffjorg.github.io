Legal
Standard 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
1032 provides that, in general, the “prevailing party” is entitled as a matter
of right to recover costs for suit in any action or proceeding. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1032, subd. (b); see Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17 Cal.4th 599,
606; Scott Co. Of Calif. v. Blount, Inc. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1103,
1108.)  Assuming the “prevailing party” requirements are met, the trial
court has no discretion to order each party to bear his or her own costs of
suit.  (Michell v. Olick (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1194, 1198; Nelson
v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 129.)   
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5,
subdivision (a) enumerates items that are allowable as costs under section
1032.  These costs must be “reasonable in
amount” and  “reasonably necessary to the
conduct of the litigation, rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its
preparation.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
1033.5, subd. (c)(2) & (c)(3).)  Except
as provided in section 1033.5, subdivision (b), other items may be allowed or
denied as costs in the discretion of the court. 
(Id., subd. (c)(4).)
 
If the items appearing in a cost
bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax
costs to show that they were not reasonable or necessary.  (Ladas v.
California State Automotive Assoc. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761,
773-774.)  But once there is a proper objection, the burden of proof is on
the party claiming them as costs.  (Ibid.) Whether a cost item was
reasonably necessary to the litigation presents a question of fact for the
trial court.  (Ibid.)   
 
“Any notice of motion to
strike or to tax costs must be served and filed 15 days after service of the
cost memorandum… If the cost memorandum was served electronically, the period
is extended as provided in Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6(a)(4).” (Cal.
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1700(b)(1).) 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
1038 provides an additional provision for the recovery of certain items.  “In any civil proceeding under the Government
Claims Act (Division 3.6 (commencing with Section 810) of Title 1 of the
Government Code) or for express or implied indemnity or for contribution in any
civil action, the court, upon motion of the defendant or cross-defendant,
shall, at the time of the granting of any summary judgment, motion for directed
verdict, motion for judgment under Section 631.8, or any nonsuit dismissing the
moving party other than the plaintiff, petitioner, cross-complainant, or intervenor,
or at a later time set forth by rule of the Judicial Council adopted under
Section 1034, determine whether or not the plaintiff, petitioner,
cross-complainant, or intervenor brought the proceeding with reasonable cause
and in the good faith belief that there was a justifiable controversy under the
facts and law which warranted the filing of the complaint, petition,
cross-complaint, or complaint or answer in intervention. If the court should
determine that the proceeding was not brought in good faith and with reasonable
cause, an additional issue shall be decided as to the defense costs reasonably
and necessarily incurred by the party or parties opposing the proceeding, and
the court shall render judgment in favor of that party in the amount of all reasonable
and necessary defense costs, in addition to those costs normally awarded to the
prevailing party. An award of defense costs under this section shall not be
made except on notice contained in a party’s papers and an opportunity to be
heard.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1038, subd. (a).)
 
“Defense costs,” as used in section
1038, “shall include reasonable attorney’s fees, expert witness fees, the
expense of services of experts, advisers, and consultants in defense of the
proceeding, and where reasonably and necessarily incurred in defending the
proceeding.” (Id., subd. (b).) 
 
A judge may only impose
costs under section 1038 against the plaintiff, not the plaintiff's attorney,
even when the attorney lacks reasonable cause and good faith in filing or
maintaining the action, because the words “counsel,” “counsel for plaintiff,”
or “plaintiff's attorney” are not included in the text of section 1038. (Settle
v State (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 215, 218–219.)

Defendant filed Notice of
Lodgment of Exhibit B, video of incident, with its Motion to Recover Costs.
 
Discussion 
 
Motion to
Recover Costs
 
Defendant seeks to to recover
costs under Code of Civil Procedure section 1038, contending Plaintiff lacked
both reasonable cause and good faith to maintain its action against the
Defendant. (Motion, 6:19-20.) 
 
Defendant cites Kobzoff v. Los
Angeles County Harbor/UCLA Med. Ctr. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 851 (“Kobzoff”). In Kobzoff,
the court held that reasonable cause is found when the public entity shows it
did not own or operate the site of where the injury occurred. (Kobzoff v.
Los Angeles County Harbor/UCLA Med. Ctr. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 851, 858.) 
 
Defendant contends that here,
Plaintiff was injured not on property Defendant owned or controlled. (Motion, 7:23-24.)

 
The Court denies this motion
under section 1038 for two separate and independent reasons.
 
First, the motion is not
timely.  A motion under section 1038 must
be made “before the discharge of the jury or entry of judgment.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1038, subd. (c).)  Here, the Court issued an order granting
Defendant’s motion for summary judgment on November 28, the Court entered
judgment in favor of Defendant on December 21, 2023, and Defendant did not file
this motion until more than two months later, on March 1, 2024.  Although there is other language in subdivision
(a) regarding additional time being provided by a rule of the Judicial Council,
no party has identified that any such rule has been adopted, and, in any event,
no sufficient excuse is offered  for the
delay of more than two months.  (See Gamble
v. Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 253, 259.)  The Court declines to follow the improperly
cited unpublished opinion and admonishes counsel for Defendant for violating the
Rules of Court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.1115(b).)
 
Second, and independently, even
on the merits, the Court finds that Plaintiff brought this action with reasonable cause and
in a “good faith belief that there was a justifiable controversy under the
facts and law which warranted the filing of the complaint.”  Defendant prevailed on summary judgment, but
that does not mean that the there was no reasonable cause or good faith belief
sufficient to support the filing of the complaint.  Moreover, Defendant continues to
mischaracterize the nature of Plaintiff’s claims as against Defendant: in
bringing his claim against Defendant, Plaintiff alleged that his injury was
caused by a dangerous condition on Defendant’s property adjacent to the
railroad tracks, not that the dangerous condition existed only on the property (not
owned by Defendant) on which the railroad tracks were located.  
 
Therefore, Defendant’s motion under
section 1038 is DENIED.
 
Motion to
Tax Costs
 
Plaintiff specifically seeks to
tax the following costs from Defendant’s Memorandum of Costs:
(1)  Item 1, filing and motion fees
for jury fees;
(2)   Item 4, deposition costs;
(3)  Item 11, court reporter fees;
(4)  Item 16, other costs for expert
fees and subpoenas of records;
(5)  And all costs Defendant has
failed to provide any supporting documentation for.
 
Plaintiff contends Item 1,
request for $229.25 for filing fee for filing of jury fees should be stricken
as this matter never proceeded to trial and the fee for jury fees is $150.00
not $229.25. (Motion, 6:12-16.)  Plaintiff
further argues Item 4, deposition costs, should be stricken as the costs are
unreasonable at $2,873.55. (Id., 6:18-19.) Plaintiff also contends court
reporter fees, Item 11, should be stricken. (Id., 7-8:25-27,1-2.) Plaintiff
states Item 16, Expert Fees, should be removed as Defendant never served an
offer to compromise pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 998. (Id.,
8:7-9.) Lastly, Plaintiff contends the costs for subpoenas of medical and other
records, again Item 16, is excessive. (Id., 8:19-20.)
 
Defendant contends that Item
1 includes the jury fee and cost of electronic filing. (Ekpezu Decl., ¶ 5.)
Second Defendant states the deposition costs cover the fact Plaintiff failed to
appear four times, with Defendant taking a notice of non-appearance at one of
these instances, and later taking Plaintiff’s deposition. (Id., ¶ 6.)
Defendant states it was reasonably necessary to obtain transcripts of the
depositions of Shaoli Xu, Max Rendon and Kenneth Tom. (Id.) Defendant
states the court reporter fees are reasonably incurred for the hearings on
Defendant’s summary judgment motion of August 21, 2023 and September 6, 2023. (Id.,
¶ 7.) 
 
Defendant argues the other
costs include the subpoenas for records, which was a reasonable and necessary
cost for litigating this case, as well as expert fees for an accident
reconstruction expert to opine on the location of the accident in relation to
Defendant’s property; Defendant states these fees are allowed under Code of
Civil Procedure section 1038. (Id., ¶ 9.) Defendant provides invoices
for charges as Exhibit A.
 
The Court finds that all of
the requested costs are allowed under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1033.5,
with the exception of the expert fees. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (b)(1).)  All other items are authorized by law,
reasonable in amount, and reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation
(rather than merely convenience or beneficial to its preparation).  
The Court awards costs to
Defendant, as the prevailing party, in the amount of $7,052.96 (the requested
amount of $18,569.96 minus the expert fees of $11,517.00)
 
Conclusion 
 
The Court DENIES Defendant’s
motion to recover defense costs under Code of Civil Procedure section 1038.
 
The Court AWARDS Defendant costs
under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033 and 1033.5 in the amount of
$7,052.96.
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
