The court will hear from the parties on April 8, 2024. There are three preliminary issues that need to be addressed before the court can reach the merits of the summary judgment motion. First, the moving parties failed to file all exhibits in support of the summary judgment motion. Second, the plaintiffs failed to file all exhibits in support of their opposition. Third, the parties filed a stipulation and proposed order to seal certain parts of the file, but the court denied the request. The court will hear from the parties regarding how they wish to proceed.
