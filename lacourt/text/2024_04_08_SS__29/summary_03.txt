```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court will hear arguments on April 8, 2024, regarding State Farm's motion. Bosch presented evidence from its employee and investigator stating that they attended a joint inspection of the scene on September 19, 2019, and were not told that any evidence would be discarded, destroyed, or not maintained. State Farm's investigator responded that Bosch did not request preservation of the refrigerator, and that State Farm would have honored such a request if made. The Court will consider whether these facts support Bosch's argument that spoliation occurred. State Farm argues that there was no spoliation because there is no "substantial probability" that Bosch's case was damaged or impaired by the destruction of the refrigerator. Bosch seeks terminating sanctions if the Court finds that spoliation occurred. The Court will consider whether terminating sanctions are appropriate in this case.
