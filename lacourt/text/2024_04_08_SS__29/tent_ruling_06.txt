 Case Number:  22STCV33581    Hearing Date:   April 8, 2024    Dept:  29  
The
Court will hear from the parties.
 
There
are three preliminary issues that must be addressed before the Court can reach
the merits of the summary judgment motion.
 
First,
on November 9, 2023, moving parties filed a “Notice of Lodgment of Evidence” in
support of the summary judgment motion. Lodging exhibits is not the same as filing
exhibits. Exhibits and other evidence offered in support of a motion must be
filed and placed into the Court’s file. (See Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.1302.) If for
some reason the moving parties wish not to file some or all of the evidence in
support of the motion, the Court cannot consider such evidence.
 
Second, on
March 25, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a “Notice of Lodgment of Evidence” in support
of their opposition. In this filing, however, all but three of the documents
described in the notice were attached to the notice, and thus are now in the
Court file, as required. As to the other three exhibits, however, they have not
been filed and cannot be considered.
 
Third,
and apparently related to the first two issues, the parties filed a stipulation
and proposed order to seal certain parts of the file. Parties seeking a sealing
order must comply with California Rules of Court, rules 2.550-2.551. These
rules require certain showings and findings. “The court must not permit a
record to be filed under seal based solely on the agreement or stipulation of
the parties.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551(a).) Accordingly, the parties’
stipulation was denied, and the proposed sealing order was not made. No motion
or application to seal has been filed.
 
If the
sealing request is denied, the party may then decide whether to withdraw the evidence
or proceed with the evidence and thereby allow it to be placed in the public
file. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551(b)(6).)
 
The
Court will hear from the parties regarding how they wish to proceed.
