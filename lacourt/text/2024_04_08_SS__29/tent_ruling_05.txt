Defendants’ Motion to Compel Plaintiff to Respond to Requests for Production (Set
One)
 
Tentative
The motions are granted.
Background
On May 31, 2022, Joseph Safdeye
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Hovanes John Haitaian and Hakop
Haitaian (collectively “Defendants”) and Does 1 through 10 for motor vehicle
negligence arising from an automobile accident occurring on August 25, 2021.  Defendants filed their answer to the
complaint on December 15, 2022.
 
On January 12, 2023, Defendants
served Plaintiff with discovery, including Form Interrogatories (Set One),
Special Interrogatories (Set One), and Requests for Production (Set One).  (Kothary Decls., ¶ 2 & Exh. A.)  Plaintiff has not responded.  (Id., ¶ 5.)
 
On April 24, 2023, Defendants filed the
three motions to compel that are now before the Court.  Plaintiff did not file an opposition, but his
counsel filed a declaration on March 26, 2024. No reply has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
 
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit
for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and confer efforts are
required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.
v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor
must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)
A party must respond to requests for production of
documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents are directed
does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) There
is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and
confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When
a party moves to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the
court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).) Requests for admission may be propounded on a party
without leave of court 10 days after the service of the summons on, or
appearance by that party, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.020(b).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery
Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines
“[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery.” 
Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery
process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2023.020, subd. (a).)
Discussion
On January 12, 2023, Defendants
served written discovery on Plaintiff. (Kothary Decls., ¶ 2 & Exhs. A.)
Plaintiff has not responded. (Id., ¶ 5.)
 
Defendants need not show anything more.  The three motions to compel are GRANTED.
 
The requests for sanctions are DENIED for two reasons.
 
First, Defendant’s requests
for sanctions are DENIED.  The statutes
governing motions to compel initial responses to interrogatories and requests
for production authorize an award of sanctions “against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes” the motion to compel.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c); § 2031.300, subd. (c).)  Here, Plaintiff did not file any opposition,
and so there is no authority under the Civil Discovery Act to award sanctions
against Plaintiff or Plaintiff’s counsel.
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 does not
provide an independent basis to award sanctions; to the contrary, the statute
expressly states that a sanctions award must be “authorized by the chapter
governing any particular discovery method or any other provision of this
title.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030.)  
The
Court of Appeal, in an opinion by Justice Moor, recently made this very point
in City of Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84
Cal.App.5th 466, 504 (“sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 do not independently
authorize the trial court to impose monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery
… without regard to any other provision of the Discovery Act”).  The Court is aware that the California
Supreme Court has granted review of the City of Los Angeles case, but the Court
notes that the order granting review, filed on January 25, 2023, states that
pending review, the appellate opinion “may be cited,” including “for its
persuasive value.”  The Court finds the
reasoning of Justice Moor to be persuasive. 
Second,
Plaintiff’s counsel filed a declaration stating that stating responses have been prepared and verified but
have not been served because Plaintiff is battling cancer. (Sanders Decl., ¶¶ 2-3.)  Under these circumstances, the Court finds
that an award of sanctions would be unjust.
To be clear,
however, Plaintiff must respond to the discovery requests.  That is Plaintiff’s obligation under the
Civil Discovery Act, and it is now his obligation under the order of this Court.  Failure to do so may result in serious, and
escalating, sanctions.
