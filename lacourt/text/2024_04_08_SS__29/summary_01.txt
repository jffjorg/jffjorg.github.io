Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motions filed by the parties. The defendant, City of Los Angeles, has filed a motion to recover defense costs under Code of Civil Procedure section 1038, while the plaintiff, Juan Ramon Valdez, has filed a motion to tax costs claimed by the defendant.

The court has denied the defendant's motion to recover defense costs under Code of Civil Procedure section 1038 for two separate reasons. First, the motion was not timely, as it was filed more than two months after the court's summary judgment order. Second, even on the merits, the court finds that the plaintiff brought the action with reasonable cause and in good faith belief, and therefore, the defendant did not establish that the plaintiff lacked reasonable cause and good faith to maintain the action.

The court has also awarded costs to the defendant in the amount of $7,052.96, as the prevailing party, under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1033.5.
