 Case Number:  20STCV33804    Hearing Date:   April 8, 2024    Dept:  29 Defendants’
Motion to Compel Plaintiff to Respond to Special Interrogatories (Set Three)
 
Tentative
 
The motion is granted.
 
Background 
 
This action arises from a motor vehicle accident which occurred
on September 13, 2018. On September 3, 2020, Plaintiff Charles Volpe
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants Courtney Pierre, Shana
Pierre, James Pierre (collectively “Defendants”), and DOES 1 through 50,
inclusive, alleging a cause of action for negligence.  
 
On December 14, 2023, Defendant James Pierre served
Plaintiff with Special Interrogatories (Set Three).  (Mendoza Decl., ¶ 3 & Exh. A.)  Although the one and only interrogatory in this
set is questionable at best, and likely objectionable, Plaintiff did not object
or otherwise respond.  (Id., ¶ 5.)
 
On February 15, 2024, Defendants filed and served this motion
to compel.  Defendants also seek
sanctions. 
 
No opposition has been filed. 
 
Legal
Standard 
 
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely response, the propounding
party may move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290;
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In
addition, a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)
Discussion              
 
Defendant James Pierre served
Plaintiff with Special Interrogatories (Set Three) on December 14, 2023.  (Mendoza Decl., ¶ 3 & Exh. A.)  Plaintiff did not object or otherwise
respond.  (Id., ¶ 5.)
 
Defendants need not show anything
more.  Their motion to compel is granted.
 
Defendants’
request for sanctions is denied.  
 
Defendants
seek sanctions under section 2030.290, subdivision (c), and sections 2023.010
and 2023.030.  Section 2030.290,
subdivision (c), authorizes an award of sanctions against a party or attorney “who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes” a motion to compel initial responses; here, no
opposition was filed.  And sections
2023.010 and 2023.030 “do not independently authorize the trial court to
impose monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery.”  (City of Los Angeles v.
PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 504.)  (The
Court is aware that the California Supreme Court has granted review of the City
of Los Angeles case, but the Court notes that the order granting review, filed
on January 25, 2023, states that pending review, the appellate opinion “may be
cited,” including “for its persuasive value.”  The Court finds the
reasoning of Justice Moor in the City of Los Angeles case to be
persuasive.)
 

Conclusion 
 
The Court GRANTS Defendants’
motion to compel.
 
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff to
provide code compliant, written, verified responses, without objection, to
Defendant James Pierre’s Special Interrogatories (Set Three) within 21 days of
notice.
 
The
Court DENIES Defendants’ request for sanctions.
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
