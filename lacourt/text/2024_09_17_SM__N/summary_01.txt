And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to demurrer filed by the defendants, Body Contour Centers, LLC d/b/a Sono Bello and Debra Stafford, M.D. The plaintiff, Thomasina White, alleges that the defendants committed medical battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress during a surgical procedure.

The court has sustained the demurrers to the first and second causes of action, but with 30 days' leave to amend. The court finds that the plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged a medical battery because it is not clear from the facts alleged that the defendants performed an operation to which the plaintiff had not consented. Similarly, the court is not convinced that the plaintiff can amend her claim to state intentional infliction of emotional distress, but will allow her one final opportunity to do so.

The court has also denied as moot the defendant's motion to strike portions of the second amended complaint, as the ruling on demurrer renders the motion unnecessary.

The court's ruling is based on the legal precedents of Cobbs v. Grant and Aubry v. Tri-City Hosp. Dist., and on the California Code of Civil Procedure, sections 436 and 437. The court's order allows the plaintiff to amend her complaint only as authorized by the court's order and prohibits her from adding new parties or causes of action without permission.
