[1] The FAC also named RCA Records as
a defendant.  Plaintiff dismissed RCA
Records from this action on October 26, 2023.


[2] Derulo and Atlantic also filed a
request for judicial notice in connection with their demurrer to the FAC.  Plaintiff filed an opposition to the request
for judicial notice, titled, “Plaintiff’s Opposition to Defendant’s Request for
Judicial Notice in Support of Motion to Dismiss”.  As Derulo and Atlantic correctly point out,
this title appears to be an error. 
Plaintiff’s opposition to the request for judicial notice is not discussed
with respect to the Motion to Dismiss. 
Rather, the substance of Plaintiff’s opposition is directed entirely at
Derulo and Atlantic’s demurrer and the allegedly improper reliance on material
extrinsic to the FAC.  Although extrinsic
material may generally not be considered when ruling on a demurrer, Plaintiff
does not provide authority that extrinsic material may not be considered when
deciding a motion to dismiss.  
 


[3] Citing Code of Civil Procedure
section 418.10, Gibson argues the motion should be denied because Moving Defendants
have already made a general appearance in this action.  The argument lacks merit.  “[F]iling the [section 410.30] motion at the
outset is permissive, not mandatory, so that CCP § 418.10 does not apply to a
“motion to stay or dismiss the action by a defendant who has made a general
appearance” (e.g., by filing an answer). [CCP § 410.30(b); see Morris v.
AGFA Corp. (2006) 144 CA4th 1452, 1460-1461, 51 CR3d 301, 307-308—motion
filed one year after action commenced did not appear to be untimely, and in any
event did not prejudice plaintiffs].” 
(Weil & Brown, Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial (The Rutter
Group 2023) ¶ 3:417.2.)  The motion is
timely.
