MOTION
FOR ATTORNEY’S FEES



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiffs
Sade Vidalcadena and Jose Vidalcadena
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendants Mercedes-Benz,
USA LLC and Keyes European LLC
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
On May 13, 2021, Plaintiffs, Sade Vidalcadena and Jose
Vidalcadena, filed this action against Defendants, Mercedes-Benz, USA LLC and Keyes
European LLC, for violations of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. 
 
On October 27, 2021, the court granted Defendants’ motion to
compel arbitration.  The case was stayed
pending binding arbitration.
 
On July 11, 2023, the parties settled the case.  Defendants stipulated that Plaintiffs would
be the prevailing party for the purposes of seeking attorney’s fees and costs
by motion.
 
On March 22, 2024, Plaintiffs filed this Motion for Attorney
Fees, Court Costs, and Litigation Expenses.
 
Defendants filed an opposition.  Plaintiffs replied. 
 
II.        DISCUSSION 
            Plaintiffs
seek a total award of $39,465.05, which consists of $34,285 in attorney’s fees,
$1,751.55 costs, and an additional $3,428.50 based on a request of a 1.1
multiplier.
            On July 11,
2023, the parties agreed to settle the matter. 
(Kohen Decl., ¶¶ 3-4, Ex. 3)  The
parties agree that the settlement provides for attorney’s fees by motion under
Civil Code section 1794.  
Civil Code section 1794, subdivision (d) provides:
(d) If the
buyer prevails in an action under this section, the buyer shall be allowed by
the court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate
amount of costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on actual time
expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by
the buyer in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action.


(Civ. Code, § 1794, subd. (d), emphasis added.)
 
            The
parties do not dispute that Plaintiffs are the prevailing party under the
Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. 
Accordingly, Plaintiffs are entitled to an award of reasonable attorney
fees as the prevailing party.  The only
matter at issue is the reasonableness of the fees requested.
 
The determination of reasonable amount of attorney fees is
within the sound discretion of trial courts. (PLCM Group v. Drexler
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095; Akins v. Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. (2000)
79 Cal.App.4th 1127, 1134.) “The determination of what constitutes a reasonable
fee generally ‘begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably
expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate….’”  “[T]he lodestar is the basic fee for
comparable legal services in the community; it may be adjusted by the court
based on factors including, as relevant herein, (1) the novelty and difficulty
of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the
extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award….”  (Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc.
(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.)  In
setting the hourly rate for an attorney fees award, courts are entitled to
consider the rate of “‘fees customarily charged by that attorney and others in
the community for similar work.’”  (Bihun
v. AT&T Information Systems, Inc. (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 976, 997
[affirming rate of $450 per hour], overruled on other grounds by Lakin v.
Watkins Associated Indus. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 644, 664.) The burden is on the
party seeking attorney fees to prove reasonableness of the fees.  (Center for Biological Diversity v. County
of San Bernardino (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 603, 615.)
 
The Court has broad discretion in determining the amount of
a reasonable attorney’s fee award which will not be overturned absent a
“manifest abuse of discretion, a prejudicial error of law, or necessary
findings not supported by substantial evidence.”  (Bernardi v. County of Monterey
(2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1393-94.) 
The Court need not explain its calculation of the amount of attorney’s
fees awarded in detail; identifying the factors considered in arriving at the
amount will suffice.  (Ventura v. ABM
Industries Inc. (2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 258, 274-75.)
            1.  Reasonable Hourly Rate
Two
attorneys worked on this matter for Plaintiff: Issac Kohen and Tamara R. Imber,
billing at rates of $525 and $295 per hour, respectively. (Kohen Decl., ¶¶ 24, 25.)
 
Defendants argue that Mr.
Kohen’s hourly billing rate of $525 is excessive and unsupported.  (Opp., p. 5.)  Defendants suggest that a billing rate of
$300 per hour for Plaintiff’s counsel’s time in this matter.
            Based
upon general prevailing rates in the Los Angeles area for this type of
litigation, the Court finds the reasonable rate for Plaintiff’s counsel’s
billing is as follows: for Lodestar purposes, the Court will award a “blended” hourly
rate of $400.00 per hour.  (See, e.g., Mikhaeilpoor
v. BMW of North America (2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 240 [trial court has
discretion to award a “blended hourly rate” for attorney’s fees motion].)  This determination considers the complexity
of the case, the quality of services provided, and the attorneys’ experience.
            2.  Number
of Hours Reasonably Expended
Plaintiff’s records reflect a total of 71 hours
billed, which does not include an expected 12.5 hours to draft this motion, review
the opposition, draft a reply, and appear at the hearing for this motion.  (Kohen Decl., ¶ 40, Ex. 1.) 
 
“[I]t is the burden of the challenging party to
point to the specific items challenged [within the moving party’s verified
billing invoice], with a sufficient argument and citations to evidence.  General arguments that fees claimed are
excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice.”  (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230
Cal.App.4th 459, 488.)  
 
Defendants object to Plaintiff’s counsel’s excessive
time spent on tasks which Defendants assert were inflated, routine filings and
template discovery, and for duplicative work.  (Opp., pp. 7-8.)  Defendants also object to tasks performed by
attorneys billing at high rates, such as Mr. Kohen’s billing for preparing the
complaint and form discovery.  Defendant
submits that a paralegal, and not an attorney, should have taken care of
drafting the complaint. This Court agrees with these observations in
considerable part.  
 
The
Court appreciates that this case was ordered to arbitration.  During arbitration, Plaintiffs served and
responded to standard written discovery and participated in mediation.  Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration and
Plaintiffs’ instant motion for fees and costs are the only motions that have
been filed and argued.  There has been
little law and motion practice.
 
Moreover, there was nothing particularly complex
or unique about this case.  The issues
involved were applicable to other consumers’ vehicles, thereby triggering
economies of scale in terms of Plaintiffs’ counsel’s efficiency in litigating
this type of lemon law case.  Litigating
this matter should not have required anything more than slight factual
modification to existing boilerplate.
 
Considering these facts, the Court agrees that
in some instances, the time quoted is excessive or unreasonable under the
circumstances. 
 
Based on the foregoing, and in view of the
totality of the circumstances, the Court finds that the total amount of
reasonable attorney’s fees in this case, using a lodestar methodology, is $26,000.
 This was calculated by multiplying the
hourly rate of $400.00 by 65 hours, which the Court deems to be the total
amount of reasonable attorney’s fees expended in this matter.
 
The Court in its discretion declines to apply
a multiplier given this Song-Beverly case did not involve novel or complex
issues of law.  
III.       CONCLUSION
            Plaintiffs
are awarded the total sum of $27,751.55, consisting of $26,000 in attorney’s
fees and $1,751.55 in costs.[1]
