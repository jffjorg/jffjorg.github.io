MOTION
TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL



 
MOVING PARTY:               Aaron
M. Brian, Nixon Peabody LLP
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
 
This action arises from the breach of a commercial lease
agreement.  Plaintiff Century City Mall,
LLC alleges its former tenant, Defendant Bailey 44, LLC, refused to pay rent
and then unlawfully abandoned the leased premises with several years of term
remaining.  
 
On December 13, 2021, the parties entered into a stipulation
and protective order. 
 
On February 21, 2024, Aaron M. Brian, counsel for Defendant
Bailey 44, LLC filed this Motion to be Relieved as Counsel.  
 
On April 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed a conditional opposition.
 
On April 9, 2024, Counsel for Defendant filed a declaration
in reply.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD 
 
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and motion to be directed to
the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general terms and without
compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a
motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of
filing a consent under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the Declaration
in Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-052));
(3) service of the notice of motion and motion and declaration on all other
parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order relieving
counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as
Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). 
 
The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw,
and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the
client, and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice.  (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  
 
III.       DISCUSSION 
 
Aaron M. Brian seeks to be relieved as counsel of record for
Defendant for the following reasons: “Irreconcilable differences have arisen
between client and attorney making it unreasonably difficult to carry out the
employment effectively.”  (Form MC-052.)   Defense
counsel’s Motion complies with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  
 
In its conditional opposition, Plaintiff explains it was
compelled to produce third-party lease agreements (“Tenant Leases”).  Plaintiff argues Defendant cannot be trusted
with the third- Tenant Leases because Defendant has twice violated the
protective order by publicly filing documents subject to the protective order.  As such, the protective order does not
provide protection and further, it presupposes that entity parties are
represented by counsel and are cooperating with its counsel.  Given that Defense Counsel seeks to be
relieved, and Defendant’s history of violating the protective order, Plaintiff
therefore requests that Defense Counsel’s withdrawal be conditioned on the
filing of a declaration which attests to the return and destruction of the
Tenant Leases to ameliorate any prejudice to Plaintiff.  
 
In reply, Counsel for Defendant filed a declaration.  The declaration states that the Tenant Leases
were disclosed only to the Defendant. 
(Brian Decl., ¶ 4.)
 
Absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s
request for withdrawal should be granted.  (People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d
398, 406.)  
 
Upon review, the court will hear from counsel regarding the
status of new counsel substituting into the case and the current status of the
documents that are subject to the protective order.  
 
IV.       CONCLUSION         
            The
court will hear from the parties. 
Dated:   April 16, 2024
