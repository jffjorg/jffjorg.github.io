The Plaintiffs seek a total award of $39,465.05, consisting of $34,285 in attorney's fees, $1,751.55 in costs, and an additional $3,428.50.

The Court awards the total amount of reasonable attorney's fees in this case is $26,000, calculated by multiplying the hourly rate of $400.00 by 65 hours. The Court declines to apply a multiplier given this Song-Beverly case did not involve novel or complex issues of law.
