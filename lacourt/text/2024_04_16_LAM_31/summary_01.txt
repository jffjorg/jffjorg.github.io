And here is the English-text summary:

The Honorable Kerry Bensinger, Judge of the Superior Court, issued a tentative ruling in the case Century City Mall, LLC v. Bailey 44, LLC (Case No. 21STCV14165). The case concerns a breach of a commercial lease agreement, with Plaintiff alleging that Defendant failed to pay rent and subsequently abandoned the leased premises. Defendant's counsel, Aaron M. Brian, filed a motion to be relieved as counsel, citing "irreconcilable differences" with his client. Plaintiff filed a conditional opposition, arguing that Defendant's history of violating the protective order and Defendant's alleged refusal to pay rent make it necessary to condition Defendant's withdrawal on the return and destruction of Tenant Leases. The court will hear from counsel regarding the status of new counsel substituting into the case and the current status of the documents subject to the protective order.
