And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses a demurrer to a complaint and a request for judicial notice filed by Derulo and Atlantic. The Judge notes that the plaintiff's opposition to the request for judicial notice is not relevant to the demurrer and that the plaintiff does not provide authority that extrinsic material may not be considered when deciding a motion to dismiss. The Judge also addresses the timeliness of the motion, citing Code of Civil Procedure section 418.10, and concludes that the motion is timely.
