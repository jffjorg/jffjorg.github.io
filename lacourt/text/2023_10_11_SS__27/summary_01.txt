And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is a motion filed by the defendants, Brian E. Boudreaux and Sophia Rocha, seeking terminating sanctions against the plaintiff, Alex Omar Munguia Romero, for failing to comply with a court order to appear for a physical examination. The court finds that Romero's failure to appear for the examination was willful and that he disobeyed the court's order. The court also notes that Romero failed to file an opposition to the motion, indicating a lack of interest in prosecuting the case. Based on these findings, the court grants the motion and dismisses Romero's complaint with prejudice.
