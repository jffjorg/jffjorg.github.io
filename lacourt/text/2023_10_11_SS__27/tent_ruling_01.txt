MOTION
FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendants
Brian E. Boudreaux and Sophia Rocha 
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition 
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            This is a consolidated action arising from a multi-vehicle
collision involving Troy Perry, Adrineh Hayrabidian, and Alex Omar Munguia
Romero (“Romero”), and Defendants, Brian Boudreaux and Lois Sophia Rocha, arising
from an automobile collision that occurred on October 1, 2019.   Romero
is currently self-represented.
 
On May 4, 2023, the Court granted Defendants’ motion to
compel Romero’s appearance at a physical examination.  Pursuant to the Court’s order, Plaintiff was
ordered to appear at a physical examination with Dr. Ronald Kvitne on May 15,
2023.  
 
On May 10, 2023, Defendants served Romero with notice of the
Court’s May 4, 2023 ruling.  Plaintiff has
not appeared for examination with Dr. Kvitne.  Defendants now seek an order for terminating
sanction of Romero’s complaint. 
Defendants do not seek monetary sanctions.
 
The motion is unopposed.
            
II.        LEGAL STANDARDS
Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030 gives the court the discretion to impose sanctions against anyone
engaging in a misuse of the discovery process.¿ Misuse of the discovery process
includes failure to respond to an authorized method of discovery or disobeying
a court order to provide discovery.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds.
(d), (g).)¿ A court may impose terminating sanctions by striking pleadings of
the party engaged in misuse of discovery or entering default judgment.¿ (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d).)¿ A violation of a discovery order is
sufficient for the imposition of terminating sanctions.¿ (Collison &
Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1620.)¿ Terminating
sanctions are appropriate when a party persists in disobeying the court’s
orders.¿ (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 795-796.)¿¿¿ 
The court should consider the
totality of the circumstances, including conduct of the party to determine if
the actions were willful, the detriment to the propounding party, and the
number of formal and informal attempts to obtain discovery.  (Lang v.
Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.)  If a lesser sanction fails
to curb abuse, a greater sanction is warranted.  (Van Sickle v. Gilbert
(2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.)  However, “the unsuccessful imposition
of a lesser sanction is not an absolute prerequisite to the utilization of the
ultimate sanction.”  (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 787.)
        
Before any sanctions may be imposed
the court must make an express finding that there has been a willful failure of
the party to serve the required answers.  (Fairfield v. Superior Court
for Los Angeles County (1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 113, 118.)  Lack of
diligence may be deemed willful where the party understood its obligation, had
the ability to comply, and failed to comply.  (Deyo, supra, 84
Cal.App.3d at p. 787; Fred Howland Co. v. Superior Court of Los Angeles
County (1966) 244 Cal.App.2d 605, 610-611.)  The party who failed to
comply with discovery obligations has the burden of showing that the failure
was not willful.  (Deyo, supra, 84
Cal.App.3d at p. 788; Cornwall v. Santa Monica Dairy Co. (1977) 66
Cal.App.3d 250; Evid. Code, §§ 500, 605.)¿ 
A terminating sanction is a
“drastic measure which should be employed with caution.”¿ (Deyo, 84
Cal.App.3d at p. 793.)¿ “A decision to order terminating sanctions should not
be made lightly.  But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history
of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce
compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing
the ultimate sanction.”¿ (Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280.)¿ While the court has discretion to impose
terminating sanctions, these sanctions “should be appropriate to the
dereliction and should not exceed that which is required to protect the
interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.”¿ (Deyo, 84
Cal.App.3d at p. 793.)¿ “[A] court is empowered to apply the ultimate sanction
against a litigant who persists in the outright refusal to comply with his
discovery obligations.”¿ (Ibid.)  Discovery sanctions are
not to be imposed for punishment, but instead are used to encourage fair
disclosure of discovery to prevent unfairness resulting for the lack of
information.¿ (See Midwife v. Bernal (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 57, 64
[superseded on other grounds as stated in Kohan v. Cohan (1991) 229
Cal.App.3d 967, 971].)¿ 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
            As the
Court stated in Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at pp. 795-796,
“[t]erminating sanctions are appropriate when a party persists in disobeying
the court’s orders.”  Terminating sanctions are appropriate here for that
very reason.  Romero did not appear for a medical examination, disobeyed a
Court Order compelling Plaintiff to appear for medical examination, and has
failed to file an opposition to this motion.    
 
            The Court
finds Romero knew of his discovery obligations and knew of the Court Order
compelling his compliance.  The Court finds Plaintiff’s failure to appear
for medical examination was willful as was his disobedience to the Court’s
Order.  Given Romero’s apparent disinterest in prosecuting this action and
apparent abandonment of the case, the Court finds lesser sanctions would not
curb the abuse.  
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
            
            Based on
the foregoing, the motion for terminating sanctions is GRANTED.  Plaintiff Alex Omar Munguia Romero’s Complaint
against Defendants Brian E. Boudreaux and Sophia Rocha is dismissed with
prejudice. 
 
Moving party to give notice.
