And here is the English-text summary:

The judge, Kerry Bensinger, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Jaleel Melendez v. Pinetree Terrace Apartments, et al. (Case No. BC692559). The plaintiff, Jaleel Melendez, is seeking to be relieved from deemed admissions made in the case. The judge has previously denied the plaintiff's motion to be relieved from deemed admissions on May 4, 2023, and the plaintiff has not filed a motion for reconsideration within the 10-day time limit. As a result, the judge has denied the plaintiff's latest motion to be relieved from deemed admissions. The judge also notes that the plaintiff has reserved a hearing date for a Motion to Set Aside/Vacate Judgment (CCP 473) on October 18, 2023, but has yet to file any motion in connection with this hearing. Given the previous rulings in the case, the judge has taken the hearing for the Motion to Set Aside/Vacate Judgment (CCP 473) off calendar.
