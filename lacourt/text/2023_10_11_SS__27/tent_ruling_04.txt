RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition 
 
 
            Claimant,
Esther Granados, a minor, by and through her parent and guardian ad litem, Petitioner,
Marili Arellano, has agreed to settle her claims against
Defendant Demetrius Watson in exchange for $12,500.  If approved, $54.24 will be used for medical
expenses, $3,125 will be used for attorney’s fees and $257 will be used for
other expenses, leaving a settlement balance of $9,063.76 for Claimant to be deposited
at Bank of America, in Long Beach, California, subject to withdrawal only on
authorization of the court.   
 
            Court
approval is required for all settlements of a minor’s claim.  (Probate Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; Code Civ. Proc. § 372.)  The petition must be verified and “must
contain a full disclosure of all information that has any bearing on the
reasonableness of the compromise, covenant, settlement, or disposition.”¿ (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)¿¿
 
            Upon
review, the Court finds the settlement balance is fair and reasonable, as is
the request for attorney’s fees.  Further,
the medical expenses and other expenses are supported by documentation.
 
            Accordingly,
the unopposed Petition is GRANTED.  The Court
sets an OSC Re: Proof of Deposit (minor –Esther Granados) for December 11, 2023
at 8:30 a.m.¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 7.953, subd. (a).)¿ If an
acknowledgement of receipt by the financial institution is filed before that
date, no appearance will be required.
 
            The
OSC Re: Dismissal (Settlement) scheduled for November 1, 2023 at 9:30 a.m. is
CONTINUED to December 11, 2023 at 8:30 a.m.
 
Moving party to give notice.
