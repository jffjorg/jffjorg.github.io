And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of the defendant's person most qualified (PMQ) and related documents, but with some limitations. The PMQ categories and requests were deemed relevant to the plaintiff's claims and not overly broad. The judge also found that the defendant's objections to the PMQ categories and requests were largely meritless. The judge ordered the defendant to produce the PMQ and related documents within 30 days of the order and to pay $861.65 in sanctions to the plaintiff. The judge also limited the timeframe of the categories and requests to the five years preceding the incident.
