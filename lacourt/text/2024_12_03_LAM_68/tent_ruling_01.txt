SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiffs
Salar Benshian, Albert Benshian, and Elham Zarabi, submitted a claim on their
homeowner insurance policy following an alleged burglary at their home.
Plaintiffs allege policies with Defendants Metropolitan Direct Property and
Casualty Insurance Company aka Metlife Auto & Home Insurance Agency, Inc., and
Lloyd's of London. Plaintiffs allege a total off $553,700 from both missing
property and damage to the home. Plaintiffs allege Metlife denied the claim on
grounds of failure to fully cooperate. On September 7, 2022, Plaintiffs filed
their complaint for 1. Breach Of Contract 2. Breach of the Implied Covenant Of
Good Faith And Fair Dealing 3. Unfair Business Practices (Bus. & Prof.
Code§ 17200) 4. Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress.
 
On
March 10, 2023, Plaintiffs dismissed Brit Gold Specialty USA without prejudice.
On April 12, 2023, Plaintiffs dismissed Lloyd’s of London without prejudice.
 
On
May 19, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint for 1. Breach of
Contract 2. Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing 3.
Unfair Business Practices (Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200) 4. Negligent
Infliction of Emotional Distress 5. Bad Faith Denial of Insurance Coverage and 6.
Discrimination against Metlife Auto & Home Insurance Agency, Inc. and
Kamkar Insurance Agency. On May 24, 2023, the court sustained the unopposed
demurrer of Metropolitan Direct Property and Casualty Insurance Company and
deemed the first amended complaint untimely. The court granted Plaintiffs leave
to a file a “new” first amended complaint.
 
On
June 15, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their “new” first amended complaint for 1.
Breach of Contract 2. Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair
Dealing 3. Unfair Business Practices (Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200) 4.
Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress 5. Bad Faith Denial of Insurance
Coverage 6. Violation Of Civil Code Section 51, and 7. Violation Of Business
And Professions Code Section 17200 against Metlife Auto & Home Insurance
Agency, Inc. and Kamkar Insurance Agency. On July 17, 2023, Plaintiff again
dismissed Lloyd’s of London without prejudice. 
 
On
January 5, 2024, Plaintiffs substituted in Lloyd's of London Subscribing to
Policy Number AG19000031-00 for Doe 1. On January 10, 2024, Plaintiffs
substituted in Defendant Parviz Aminpour for Doe 2. On January 11, 2024, the
court dismissed Kamkar Insurance Agency without prejudice. On January 26, 2024,
Certain Underwriters at Lloyd’s, London Subscribing to Policy Number
AG19000031-00 answered the first amended complaint. 
 
On
August 21, 2023, the court sustained the demurrer of Metropolitan Direct
Property and Casualty Insurance Company to the entire complaint without leave
to amend. 
 
On
October 28, 2024, a notice of lien was filed in relation to an unlawful
detainer action entitled Parviz Aminpous v. Salar Benshian, 21STUD11872.
 
RULING: Granted
Defendant
Certain Underwriters at Lloyd’s of London moves to compel verifications as to Requests
for Admissions (set one) and Form Interrogatories (set one) served on Plaintiffs.
 
Defendant represents service of requests for
admissions and form interrogatories on January 30, 2024. [Declaration of Elizabeth
Dolter, ¶ 4, Ex. A.] The verifications remain outstanding at the time of the
filing of the motion. [Id., ¶¶ 6-8.]
 
Unverified
responses constitute non-responses. (Appleton
v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.) The court therefore
grants the motion to compel responses to form interrogatories and deems the
requests for admissions admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a-b),
2033.280, subd. (a-b).)
 
The
court imposes sanctions in the amount of $500 imposed against all Plaintiffs,
joint and several with counsel, and payable within 30 days, as the verification
was only provided after the filing of the hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290, subd. (c), 2033.280, subd. (c).)
 
The
court will concurrently conduct the Case Management Conference, et al.
 
Defendant
to provide notice.
