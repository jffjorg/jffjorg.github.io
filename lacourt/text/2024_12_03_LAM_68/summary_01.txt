Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has ruled on a motion to compel verifications for form interrogatories and requests for admissions filed by the Defendant, Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's of London. The Plaintiffs, Salar Benshian, Albert Benshian, and Elham Zarabi, had submitted a claim following an alleged burglary at their home and were seeking damages from the Defendant. The Defendant denied the claim due to alleged lack of cooperation.

The Judge found that the Plaintiffs had failed to provide verifications for the requests for admissions and form interrogatories served on them, and therefore granted the motion to compel verifications. The Judge also deemed the requests for admissions admitted and imposed sanctions in the amount of $500 against all Plaintiffs, joint and several with counsel, payable within 30 days.

The Judge noted that the failure to provide verifications constitutes non-responses and that the court will concurrently conduct the Case Management Conference, et al. The Defendant is required to provide notice.
