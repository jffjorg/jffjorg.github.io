STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On February 20, 2020, Plaintiff Immigrant Rights Defense
Council, LLC (Plaintiff) filed a Complaint against Defendants Izabella Sklar,
Access Legal Services and Same Day Marriage in Los Angeles, Inc. (Defendants) with
one cause of action for Violation of the Immigration Consultant Act. Plaintiff
seeks injunctive relief. 
 
According to the Complaint, Defendants started offering
immigration services in 2003 but did not obtain immigration consultant bonds in
violation of Bus. & Prof. Code § 22443.3. Plaintiff also alleges that
Defendants created an “aura of expertise” and referred to themselves as
immigration law experts without taking the immigration specialization exam,
obtaining a law degree, or maintaining the required immigration consultant
bond.
 
On April 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed its acceptance of
Defendants’ CCP § 998 Offer to Compromise. The court entered Judgment that same
day.
 
On April 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Entry of
Judgment and Memorandum of Costs.
 
On June 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for
Attorneys’ Fees.
 
On August 28, 2024, Defendants filed an opposition. 
 
On September 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply.
 
On September 4, 2024, Defendants filed a CCP § 170.6
peremptory challenge to judicial officer which the court GRANTED.
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
Evidentiary
Objections
 
This court is unaware of any legal
authority which requires a court to rule on evidentiary objections on a motion,
except as to a motion for summary motion/adjudication [CCP § 437c (q)] or
a special motion to strike [CCP § 425.16 (b)(2); see also, Sweetwater Union High School Dist. v. Gilbane Building Co. (2019)
6 Cal.5th 931, 947-949.]   As such, this court respectfully
declines to rule on any of these objections.  This court is well aware of
the rules of evidence, and to how much weight, if any, should be given to any
of the proposed evidence.
 
Motion for
Attorneys’ Fees
 
CCP §§ 1032 and 1033.5(a)(10) provide that a prevailing
party may recover its costs as a matter of right, and that those costs may
include attorneys’ fees when authorized by statute, law, or contract. 
 
Bus & Prof Code § 22446.5 provides for an award of
attorneys’ fees: 
 
“(b) Any other party who, upon
information and belief, claims a violation of this chapter has been committed
by an immigration consultant may bring a civil action for injunctive relief on
behalf of the general public and, upon prevailing, shall recover reasonable
attorneys' fees and costs.” 
 
“[A]bsent circumstances rendering the award unjust, an
attorney fee award should ordinarily include compensation for all the hours reasonably spent, including those relating solely to the fee. 
We explained that the purpose behind statutory fee authorizations—i.e.,
encouraging attorneys to act as private attorneys general and to vindicate
important rights affecting the public interest—will often be frustrated,
sometimes nullified, if awards are diluted or dissipated by lengthy,
uncompensated proceedings to fix or defend a rightful fee claim.”  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122,
1133-34 (emphasis in original).)  “The fee setting inquiry in California
ordinarily begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably
expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.... The lodestar figure may
then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors specific to the case, in
order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services
provided.”  (Id. at 1134.) 
Other factors to consider in fixing the reasonableness of fees to be considered
beyond the fee agreement alone include, but are not limited to “(1) the time
and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and
the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly; (2) the likelihood
that the acceptance of the particular employment will preclude other employment
by the lawyer; (3) the fee customarily charged in this locality for similar
legal services; (4) the amount involved and the results obtained; (5) the time
limitations imposed by the circumstances; and (6) the experience, reputation,
and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services.”  (Glendora Community Redevelopment Agency v.
Demeter (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 465, 470; EnPalm,
LLC v.¿Teitler¿Family Trust¿(2008)
162 Cal. App. 4th 770, 774 (emphasis in original).)  
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Plaintiff contends its fees and costs are reasonable and the
court should award them in full. The amount constitutes 36.2 hours billed at
$750 per hour for $27,150 in attorneys’ fees plus a 1.5 lodestar multiplier.
Defendants argue Plaintiff’s fees are outrageously unreasonable because this is
a boilerplate complaint and Counsel’s bills are inflated and/or claimed for
piggybacked work on hundreds of prior cookie-cutter cases.[1]
Plaintiff replies that it is unclear which party is opposing the motion, it is
untimely, the lodestar fees requested are reasonable, and Defendants did not
provide admissible evidence supporting their position.
 
Timeliness
 
Plaintiff argues that the court should exercise its
discretion to disregard Defendants’ opposition because it was untimely.
 
A court may properly consider papers that are not timely
filed pursuant to CCP § 1005(b) unless it affects “substantial rights.” (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1300(d); CCP § 475.) Here, Plaintiff responded to the
substantive arguments in the opposition and so the court exercises its
discretion to consider those arguments.
 
Prevailing Party
 
Here, Plaintiff is the prevailing party because the CCP §
998 Offer provides for entry of judgment in Plaintiff’s favor. Additionally,
the CCP § 998 Offer provides that Plaintiff may recover reasonable attorneys’
fees and costs.
 
Lodestar Fees
 
The lodestar method looks at the time spent on a matter
multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate. (Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49). The two-step process begins with the lodestar method,
which is the time spent on the matter multiple by the hourly rate. After the
lodestar method, the second step is determining whether a multiplier should be
applied. The factors that courts look at to determine if a multiplier is
reasonable are: 1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2)
the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of
the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent
nature of the fee award.” (Ketchum v.
Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132).  
 
i.                   
Reasonableness of Hourly Rate
“In determining hourly rates, the court must look to the
“prevailing market rates in the relevant community.” (Bell v. Clackamas County¿(9th Cir.2003) 341 F.3d 858, 868.) The
rates of comparable attorneys in the forum district are usually used. (See¿Gates v. Deukmejian¿(9th Cir.1992) 987
F.2d 1392, 1405.) In making its calculation, the court should also consider the
experience, skill, and reputation of the attorney requesting fees.” (Heritage Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy¿(2013)
215 Cal.App.4th 972, 1009.) 
 
The court finds that these hourly rates are reasonable based
on the hourly rate of similarly situated attorneys in the Los Angeles area.
Based on the Laffey Matrix, attorneys with similar years of experience as
Plaintiff’s counsel as identified above have comparable.[2] However,
billing at a high rate comes with the expectation that the attorney also works
in an efficient manner that reflects the premium paid for his or her services.
The court considers this fact in addressing the reasonableness of the hours
expended, below.   
 
ii.                 
Reasonableness of Hours Billed
Although a verified fee bill is “prima facie evidence the
costs, expenses and services listed were necessarily incurred,” (Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d
677, 682), ultimately, Counsel still has the burden to demonstrate the
reasonableness of charges. (Mikhaeilpoor
v. BMW of North America (2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 240, 247.) Plaintiff
provided a declaration concerning time spent on this case rather than a
verified fee bill. (Medvei Decl. ¶ 4.) The court can still determine whether
the items billed are reasonable and necessarily incurred. Upon reviewing these
charges, Defendants’ contention that the billings are excessive and
unreasonable is well taken.
 
Plaintiff requests 36.2 hours for this matter that settled
within two months of filing the Complaint. (Medvei Decl. ¶ 4.) With Plaintiff’s
expertise warranting an hourly rate of $750 (or even $1,000 alluded to), the
time billed for this matter is unreasonable. First, Plaintiff’s request for
10.5 hours of pre-filing investigation is unreasonable because Plaintiff
apparently did not rely on the extensive documentation in its Complaint.
Rather, Plaintiff relied on Yelp reviews and Defendants’ website. (Complaint ¶¶
13, 15.) Second, Plaintiff’s overall billing for “settlement negotiations” and
“meet and confer re settlement” is suspiciously high because the supposed
negotiations occurred via short emails with Defendants’ counsel and Plaintiff
billed for some settlement negotiation calls that did not occur. (Gentino Decl.
¶¶ 3, 4, 5, 6, 13.) Third, Plaintiff’s billing for templated documents and
Judicial Council forms is unreasonable. While templates are useful, if
attorneys are still billing significant time to make minor changes, such use of
legal resources is unwarranted and any such bill is unreasonable, particularly
if the attorney is billing at a high hourly rate. (Mikhaeilpoor, supra, at
p. 250.) Finally, Plaintiff’s billing for the instant motion, reply, and
hearing attendance is unreasonable because this is not such a complicated
motion warranting 16 hours of work from a seasoned attorney. The court
therefore reduces the hours spent from 36.2 hours to 6.2 hours.[3]
 
Costs
 
Plaintiff requests $635.66 in costs. Defendants do not
challenge the costs. Therefore, the court will award costs as requested.
 
Accordingly, the court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion for
attorneys’ fees and costs in part.
 
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.Motion for Attorneys’ Fees and
Costs is GRANTED in part;
2.Plaintiff is awarded $5,345.66;
3.Plaintiff to file a proposed
amended judgment within 14 days’ notice of this ruling.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
