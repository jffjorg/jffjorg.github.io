And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, American Express National Bank, is seeking a default judgment against the defendant, David Gross, for the amount of $77,133.99. The bank issued a credit card to Gross pursuant to a credit card agreement, but he failed to repay the amounts charged on the card. The bank filed a complaint and served Gross with the complaint and proof of service, but he did not respond to the complaint. The bank then filed a request for entry of default, which was granted, and subsequently requested a default judgment. The bank has properly complied with all the substantive and procedural requirements for a default judgment, including providing a properly authenticated billing statement and a memorandum of costs. The defendant's answer to the complaint was unauthorized and void after default was entered, and he did not file a motion to set aside default. Therefore, the court grants the plaintiff's request for default judgment and awards a default judgment in the amount of $77,133.99 in favor of the plaintiff.
