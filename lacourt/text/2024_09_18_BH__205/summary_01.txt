And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the request for entry of default judgment by The Real A Team Corporation against Independence HCM, Inc., et al. The case involves a dispute over the payment of services rendered by The Real A Team Corporation to Legacy Plus Unlimited d/b/a Alta Vista Health Services, which was later merged with Independence HCM, Inc. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants failed to pay for the services and engaged in fraudulent activities.

The Court has reviewed the evidence submitted by the plaintiff and has determined that the request for entry of default judgment is denied. The Court finds that the plaintiff has not properly substantiated its claim for attorneys' fees and that the declaration of the CEO of The Real A Team Corporation does not provide sufficient evidence of the facts alleged.

The Court also notes that the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment does not comply with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 585, which sets forth the procedures for obtaining a default judgment. The Court will require the plaintiff to re-file its request for entry of default judgment with additional evidence and a proper summary of the case.

Accordingly, the Court DENIES the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment.
