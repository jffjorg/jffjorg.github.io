Here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court is considering a motion to amend the complaint to add a claim for punitive damages against Dr. Garth Fisher and others. The plaintiff, Ashley Matthau, was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a tumor excision procedure with Dr. Fisher. However, Dr. Fisher failed to take out sufficient margins, leaving cancer in Matthau's body. The court finds that the plaintiff has established a substantial probability of prevailing on their fraud claim against Dr. Fisher, which includes allegations of misrepresentation, knowledge of falsity, intent to defraud, justifiable reliance, and resulting damage. As a result, the court grants the motion to amend the complaint to add a claim for punitive damages.
