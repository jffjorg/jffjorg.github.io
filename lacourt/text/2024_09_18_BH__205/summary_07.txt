Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling regarding Defendant Jerry Witsie's motion to quash service of summons for lack of personal jurisdiction or alternatively, to stay the action for forum non conveniens. The Court finds that it lacks both general and specific jurisdiction over the Defendant. The Defendant resides in Las Vegas, Nevada and has no contacts with the State of California that would support the exercise of personal jurisdiction. The Court also finds that the Defendant did not purposefully avail himself of forum benefits and that the controversy is not related to or arising out of any contacts with the forum. As a result, the Court grants the Defendant's motion to quash service of summons and declines to consider the alternative motion to stay the action for forum non conveniens.
