And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for reconsideration filed by the plaintiff, Dennis Stankie, in a case involving an alleged assault at the Santa Monica Bay Woman's Club. The plaintiff's original motion to amend his complaint was denied because he failed to provide a required declaration. The plaintiff now moves for reconsideration, submitting the required declaration, but the Judge denies the motion because the declaration does not address the proposed addition of claims for assault and battery, and the plaintiff does not provide a satisfactory explanation for failing to provide the declaration earlier. The Judge also notes that the plaintiff's reply in support of the motion was single-spaced and exceeded the 10-page limit.
