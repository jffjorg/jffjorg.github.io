And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to vacate default filed by Defendant Joseph Hallberg in an unlawful detainer action. The Plaintiff, RAR2-Marina Marketplace LLC, leased the premises to Phenix Salon Suites, Marina Del Rey, LLC, which then sublet the space to Hallberg and others. The Plaintiff initiated an unlawful detainer action against Phenix and all occupants, including Hallberg, on February 29, 2024. Hallberg filed a motion to quash, which was denied as untimely, and then filed a demurrer, which was overruled on July 5, 2024. Hallberg then attempted to file an answer, but it was rejected because of the default. Hallberg argues that the default is void because it was entered while his time to file a responsive pleading had not yet passed. However, the Court finds that the lease expired on April 30, 2024, and there is no live controversy between the parties as to the right of current possession. Therefore, the Court denies the motion to vacate default as moot.
