This is the Judge's tentative ruling regarding a motion to compel compliance with a deposition subpoena. The Defendant, Ralphs Grocery Company and The Kroger Co., is seeking to compel Jose Cruz Cisneros, a third-party witness, to appear for a deposition. The Defendant personally served Cisneros with a deposition subpoena, but he failed to appear. The motion is denied without prejudice due to the failure to properly serve the moving papers on Cisneros. The Judge orders the Defendant to personally serve a deposition subpoena on Cisneros, along with the court order compelling the deposition, and to schedule the deposition for at least five days after personal service. If the parties submit on the tentative, the motion will be denied due to lack of proof of personal service.
