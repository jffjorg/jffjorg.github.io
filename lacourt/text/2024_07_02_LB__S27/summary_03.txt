And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted UPS's motion to compel further responses from Charles White in connection with White's appeal of a labor commissioner decision. The dispute arises from UPS's request for production of documents (RPDs) seeking communications between White and third parties, including witnesses he intends to call at trial. The judge finds that White's responses to RPD 1, which seeks documents related to White's complaint, are insufficient and that White must provide all communications with third parties that relate to the allegations set forth in his complaint. The judge denies UPS's motion to compel further responses to RPDs 2-12, which seek communications between White and third parties related to White's employment. The judge also denies White's request for sanctions and orders White to serve a further response to RPD 1 within ten days. The parties are ordered to meet and confer to agree upon a date and time for production of the further responses.
