 Case Number:  23LBCV00678    Hearing Date:   July 2, 2024    Dept:  S27 Plaintiffs filed this action
against Defendants for damages arising out of an automobile accident.  The parties have agreed to a global
settlement of the entire lawsuit for the total amount of $30,000.  If the settlement is approved, $7500 will be
allocated to each of the two minor plaintiffs, and the remaining $15,000 will
be allocated to their father and GAL.  
 
With respect to Mason’s proposed
settlement, $393.65 would be used for medical expenses, $1766.11 for attorneys’
fees, and $435.53 for costs of suit, leaving $4904.71 to be placed in a blocked
account.  Mason suffered from headaches,
chest pain, nausea, back pain, and shoulder pain as a result of the accident,
but he has completely recovered from all injuries.
 
With respect to Broden’s proposed
settlement, $356.56 would be used for medical expenses, $1762.70 for attorneys’
fees, and $449.18 for costs of suit, leaving $4931.56 to be placed in a blocked
account.  Broden suffered from headaches,
dizziness, tinnitus, nausea, knee pain, and chest pain as a result of the
accident, but he has completely recovered from all injuries.
 
The Court has two minor concerns
with the petitions, each of which must be addressed at the hearing before the
Court will grant the petitions.  First, ¶11
in each petition appears to include erroneous information.  It indicates Petitioner is not a plaintiff in
the action and would not receive money under the settlement.  Petitioner/GAL, Brian Bundies, however, IS a
plaintiff in the action and would receive $15,000 as a result of the
settlement.  Related, and more
importantly, Attachment 11b(6) requires Petitioner to state the reasons for the
allocation of the settlement proceeds. 
Attachment 11b(6) does not meaningfully do so.  It does not explain why Petitioner, the adult
who will receive immediate access to his funds, is receiving more of the
proceeds of the settlement than the two minors. 
There is no indication that his injuries were more severe or that the
settlement is proportionate to medical expenses, injuries, etc.  The Court wishes to hear from Petitioner and
Counsel about the allocation of settlement proceeds at the hearing.
 
CRC 7.952 requires Petitioner and
the minors to appear at the hearing before the Court grants the petitions.  The minors are 13 and 15, so the Court will
require their appearance at the hearing. 
If the Court is satisfied with the testimony received, it will grant the
applications and issue the proposed orders on the applications.
