Here is a summary in English text:

The plaintiff, Tokio Marine America Insurance Company, filed a lawsuit against the defendant, Prestig, Inc., claiming carrier liability under the Carmack Amendment. The defendant moved for summary judgment and/or summary adjudication, arguing that the Coverage of Goods at Sea Act (COGSA) governs the action and that the plaintiff's claim is barred by the contractual claim presentation provision in the waybill and the statute of limitations in COGSA. The plaintiff opposed the motion, arguing that the defendant failed to provide admissible evidence showing that waybill ONEDL9CK0425400 applies and that there are triable issues concerning whether ONEDL9CK0425401 applies.

The judge found that there are triable issues of material fact concerning whether waybill ONEDL9CK0425400 or ONEDL9CK0425401 applies, and therefore denied the motion for summary judgment. The judge also denied the alternative motion for summary adjudication, finding that the issue of what constitutes a "package" under the ONE Sea Waybill is not suitable for summary adjudication.
