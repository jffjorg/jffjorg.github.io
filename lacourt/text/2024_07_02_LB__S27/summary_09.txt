And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a global settlement of a lawsuit between the parties. The settlement is for a total of $30,000, with $7500 allocated to each of the two minor plaintiffs and the remaining $15,000 allocated to their father and GAL. The Judge has expressed two minor concerns with the petitions, including the inclusion of erroneous information and the lack of explanation for the allocation of settlement proceeds. The Judge is requiring the petitioner and counsel to appear at the hearing to explain the allocation of the settlement proceeds and to address the concerns raised by the Court. If the Court is satisfied with the testimony received, it will grant the applications and issue the proposed orders on the applications.
