```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the motion to quash and the alternative motion to dismiss based on forum non conveniens. The motion to quash was previously denied on May 2, 2024, and the court continued the hearing to permit further briefing on the issues of statute of limitations and medical treatment in California. The defendants argued that imposition of personal jurisdiction over them is improper, but the court finds that they will not waive the one-year statute of limitations in Puerto Rico. As a result, Puerto Rico is not a suitable alternative forum, and the court denies the alternative motion to dismiss based on the doctrine of forum non conveniens. The motion is denied in its entirety.
