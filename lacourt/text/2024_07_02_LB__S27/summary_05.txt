Here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for summary judgment filed by SAI Long Beach B, Inc. dba Long Beach BMW, Brooke Ashley Baker, and Rita Regalado. The motion seeks summary judgment on the complaint, contending that vicarious liability does not apply because Baker was on a break at the time of the incident and was moving her car for her own personal purposes.

The Judge has reviewed the facts of the case, including the use of tandem parking at the workplace and Baker's use of her 10-minute break to move her vehicle to the street. The Judge has found that there are triable issues of material fact concerning vicarious liability and has declined to determine whether the plaintiff pled a direct liability claim and/or should be permitted leave to do so.

The Judge has also considered the case law, including Vogt v. Herron Construction, Inc., Bailey v. Filco, Inc., and Avila v. Standard Oil Co. The Judge has found that the instant case is more closely analogous to Cruz and Avila than it is to Bailey.

The Judge has denied the motion for summary judgment, finding that it is for the jury to determine whether Baker's acts were sufficiently foreseeable and related to her work duties so as to impose liability. The Judge has also denied the alternative motion for summary adjudication, finding that the motion does not provide any additional argument in support of the motion.

The Judge has ordered the defendant to give notice and has directed parties who intend to submit on the tentative to send an email to the court indicating their intention to do so.
