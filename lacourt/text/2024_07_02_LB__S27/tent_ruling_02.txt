6/25/24, Defendant filed reply papers, indicating Plaintiff refused to provide
dates until months after the motions were filed, and asking the Court to compel

not go forward.  
 
The hearing on the motions is
continued to Thursday, 8/15/24. 
Defendant must take the motions off calendar if they are moot.  If they are not moot, each party must file a
