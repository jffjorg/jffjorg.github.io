And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case between Glovis America, Inc. (the plaintiff) and Sehee Corp., Del Amo Petroleum, and Syed Faizi (the defendants). The plaintiff is seeking to conduct a deposition of Syed Faizi, who has been suffering from chronic bronchitis and pneumonia, making it impossible to schedule the deposition. The defendants are asking for an indefinite continuance of the trial date. The judge has decided not to order the deposition to go forward on a specific date, but instead will continue the trial date from July 15, 2024 to September 16, 2024. The judge has also continued the FSC date from July 12, 2024 to September 13, 2024. The parties are required to continue to communicate and schedule the depositions as soon as Faizi's health improves, and the defense counsel must provide updated health information and medical records to the plaintiff's attorney.
