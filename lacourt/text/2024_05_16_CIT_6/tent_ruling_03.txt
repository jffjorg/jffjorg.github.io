PNC Bank’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment 
Defendants:  Household
Consulting Group Inc., Denise G. Gallego 
TENTATIVE RULING
            Plaintiff’s
request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.           
BACKGROUND           
            This
is an action for breach of contract and common counts in connection with a bank
loan. On November 30, 2023, plaintiff PNC Bank, National Association, successor
by merger from Compass Bank (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants
Householding Consulting Group Inc. (Household), Denise G. Gallego (Gallego)
(collectively, Defendants), and Does 1 through 100, alleging causes of action
for breach of loan agreement, breach of guaranty, money lent, and account
stated. 
            On
January 31, 2024, default was entered against Defendants. On April 30, 2024,
Plaintiff submitted a request for entry of default judgment.           
LEGAL
STANDARD 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party
has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party
seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court
Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other
admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest
computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a declaration
of nonmilitary status; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all
parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate
judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for
attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.) 
ANALYSIS 
Plaintiff
seeks default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $214,554.22,
including $200,000 in damages, $1,020.69 in late charges, $11,726.03 in
interest, $1,200.00 in attorney fees, and $607.50 in costs. The Court still finds
some problems with Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment. First, Plaintiff’s
late charges still do not match the amount alleged in the complaint. The
complaint alleges a late charge of $1,010.69, (Compl., ¶¶ 20-21; Id.,
Prayer for Relief, ¶ 3), but Plaintiff requests $1,020.69 in the default
judgment package, (CIV-100, ¶ 2, subd. (b)(1); JUD-100, ¶ 6, subd. (a)(2).)
Plaintiff’s default judgment request exceeds the amount of damages demanded in
the complaint, which the Court cannot grant. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 585, subd.
(a).) 
Second,
Plaintiff’s prejudgment interest calculation is calculated under California
law, despite the underlying agreements being governed by Delaware law. (Compl.,
Ex. 1, p. 24 of pdf, ¶ 10.16; Id., Ex. 1, p. 34 of pdf, ¶ 17; Id.,
Ex. 2, p. 48 of pdf, ¶ 20.) This means the laws of the State of Delaware govern
the prejudgment interest determination here. (Airs Aromatics, LLC v. CBL
Data Recovery Technologies Inc. (2020) 50 Cal.App.5th 1009, 1014.) If
Plaintiff wishes to recover prejudgment interest, Plaintiff must provide Delaware
law supporting the prejudgment interest and calculation. 
Third, as
the Court previously noted, the Court could not find an attorney’s fees
provision in the underlying agreements between Plaintiff and Defendant
Household. (See Compl., Ex. 1; Minute Order (4/17/24).) The guaranties on the
other hand do contain attorney’s fees clauses between Plaintiff and Defendant
Gallego. (See Compl., Ex. 2, p. 41 of pdf; Id., p. 43 of pdf, ¶ 1, subd.
(a).) Additionally, Civil Code section 1717.5, subdivision (a), provides that
the attorney’s fees imposed by this section may not be imposed unless the
written agreement contains a statement that the prevailing party is entitled to
the fees provided by this section. (Civ. Code, § 1717.5, subd. (a).) Since the underlying
agreements between Plaintiff and Defendant Household do not contain an
attorney’s fees clause, Plaintiff may not recover attorney’s fees against
Defendant Household. 
Fourth,
Plaintiff did not submit an updated Summary of the Case. (See Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1800, subd. (1).) 
CONCLUSION
              Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s request
for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
