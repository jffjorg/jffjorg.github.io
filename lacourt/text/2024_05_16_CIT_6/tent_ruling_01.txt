  Case Number:  22PSCV00964    Hearing Date:   May 16, 2024    Dept:  6 CASE NAME:  Puente Hills  Business Center, L.P. v. A211 Incorporation, et al.  Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorney's Fees  TENTATIVE  RULING            The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion for attorney's fees in the  reduced amount of $15,975.00, plus $1,857.30 in costs.               Plaintiff is ordered to give notice  of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.  BACKGROUND  This is a breach of contract action pertaining to the rental of commercial  real property. On September 1, 2022, plaintiff Puente Hills Business Center,  L.P. (Plaintiff) filed this action against Defendants A211 Incorporation  (A211), Jung Il Jang (Jang) (collectively, Defendants), and Does 1 to 10,  alleging causes of action for breach of written lease agreement (as against  A211), breach of written guaranty (as against Jang), and for common counts as  to all Defendants.  Following a non-jury trial on February 23, 2024, the Court awarded  judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendants, jointly and severally,  in the amount of $32,713.87. Judgment was entered on March 6, 2024.  On March 21, 2023, Plaintiff moved for attorney fees. The motion  is unopposed.  LEGAL  STANDARD              In any  action on a contract, where the contract specifically provides that attorney's  fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded  either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is  determined to be the party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she is the  party specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable  attorney's fees in addition to other costs.  (Civ. Code, § 1717, subd. (a).)  The party seeking fees and costs bears the burden  to show "the fees incurred were allowable, were reasonably necessary to the  conduct of the litigation, and were reasonable in amount." (Nightingale  v. Hyundai Motor America (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 104.) To satisfy this  burden, evidence and descriptions of billable tasks must be presented in  sufficient detail, enabling the court to evaluate whether the case was  overstaffed, the time attorneys spent on specific claims, and the  reasonableness of the hours expended.(Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014)  230 Cal.App.4th 459, 486-487.)  “A trial court assessing attorney fees begins  with a touchstone or lodestar figure, based on the ‘careful compilation of the  time spent and reasonable hourly compensation of each attorney… involved in the  presentation of the case.” (Christian Research Institutev. Alnor (2008) 165  Cal.App.4th 1315, 1321.) “The reasonableness of attorney fees is within the  discretion of the trial court, to be determined from a consideration of such  factors as the nature of the litigation, the complexity of the issues, the experience  and expertise of counsel and the amount of time involved. [Citation.] The court  may also consider whether the amount requested is based upon unnecessary or  duplicative work. [Citation.]” (Wilkerson v. Sullivan (2002) 99  Cal.App.4th 443, 448.)  “The courts repeatedly have stated that the trial court is in the  best position to value the services rendered by the attorneys in his or her  courtroom [citation], and this includes the determination of the hourly rate  that will be used in the lodestar calculus. [Citation.]” (569 E. Cnty.  Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc. (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th  426, 436-437.)  DISCUSSION                        Plaintiff seeks  attorney fees in the amount of $16,920.00 based on paragraph 33.k of the  subject lease agreement and paragraph 6 of the corresponding guaranty, which  provide for recovery of attorney fees. Plaintiff contends it is the prevailing  party for purposes of Civil Code section 1717 since it was awarded judgment at  trial and that the amount requested is reasonable. More specifically, Plaintiff  indicates its counsel’s hourly rate for this matter was $350.00[1] and  that the amount of hours expended in connection with this matter for a total  amount of $13,875.00, i.e., from August 2022 to February 27, 2024, was  reasonable. Plaintiff contends it was forced to expend time, money and  resources litigating this action, which resulted in a decision and judgment in  favor of Plaintiff.              The Court finds Plaintiff’s motion  is well taken. The Court also notes that Defendants did not oppose the motion,  which the Court construes as a tacit admission that Plaintiff’s arguments are  meritorious. (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997)  58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410; C. Opposing the Motion—and Rebutting the Opposition,  Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial Ch. 9(I)-C, ¶ 9:105.10.)  Here,  the subject lease agreement and corresponding guaranty provide for the recovery  of attorney fees. (Igo Decl., Ex. 1, ¶ 33.k; Id., Ex. E of Ex. 1, ¶ 6.) If  a plaintiff obtains relief that the plaintiff has requested on the contract  claims in an action, the plaintiff is the prevailing party on the contract as a  matter of law. (Texas Commerce Bank v. Garamendi (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th  1234, 1247; Smith v. Krueger (1983) 150 Cal.App.3d 752,757.) The Court awarded judgment in favor of Plaintiff and  against Defendants. (Judgment (3/6/24).) Thus, Plaintiff is the prevailing  party here and is therefore entitled to recover attorney fees. (Civ. Code, §  1717, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).)               The Court also finds that the hourly rate of  $350.00 is reasonable for the applicable legal community. (See Center for  Biological Diversity (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 603, 616; 569  E. Cnty. Boulevard LLC, supra, 6 Cal.App.5th at pp. 436-437.) The burden is on the party seeking attorney fees to prove  the reasonableness of those fees. (Id. at p. 615.) Plaintiff’s attorney,  Anthony W. Burton, indicates having practiced law primarily in Southern  California, i.e., Los Angeles County, Orange County, Riverside County, and San  Diego County, since 2009. (Burton Decl., ¶ 3.) Plaintiff’s attorney also  indicates having tried multiple cases before a judge and jury, having filed  multiple summary judgment motions over the years, and having run his own firm  since the end of 2019. (Burton Decl., ¶¶ 4, 6.) Thus, Plaintiff’s counsel’s  hourly rate in this action is reasonable.  The  Court further finds the amount of hours expended to be reasonable. A  verified fee bill is prima facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and  services listed were reasonable. (Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d  677, 682). After reviewing the invoices and billing summary provided by  Plaintiff, (Burton Decl., ¶ 10), and considering the nature and extent of the  litigation, the Court finds that the hours billed are reasonable.  However, the Court notes one entry in Plaintiff’s  counsel’s billing summary that is problematic, namely the entry on July 10,  2023, which says, “Review of client updated damages chart; Call Defendant to  discuss potential settlement,” and was billed for 0.20 hours. (Burton Decl., ¶  10.) This is a duplicate entry, as there is another entry on July 10, 2023 with  the same description of services provided and for the same amount of time  expended. (Id.) The Court will therefore deduct this entry, which  reduces the award of attorney fees to $13,805.00.  As for the time expended on this motion, the  Court finds the appropriate amount of time to bill for it is the 5.7 hours  expended drafting the motion and corresponding declarations. (Burton Decl., ¶  11.) Since the motion is unopposed, Plaintiff will have incurred no time or  expense in having its counsel review an opposition or prepare a reply. The  Court will also reduce the amount of time for the hearing on this motion to 0.5  hours. Thus, the time awarded for this motion will be 6.2 hours, multiplied by  the hourly rate of $350.00, for a total of $2,170.00.  Accordingly, the total attorney fees awarded here  is $15,975.00, i.e., $13,805.00 plus $2,170.00.  The Court further GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for costs  in the amount of $1,857.30, finding the costs incurred appropriate. (Burton  Decl., ¶ 12; Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subds. (a)(1), (a)(4).)  CONCLUSION              The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion  for attorney's fees in the reduced amount of $15,975.00, plus $1,857.30 in costs.              Plaintiff  is ordered to give notice of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of  this order.
