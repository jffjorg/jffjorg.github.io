I. BACKGROUND
 
On September
25, 2020, Plaintiff Alta Arcadia Investments, LLC (“Plaintiff” or “Alta”) filed
this action against Defendant Sylvia Wei-Ting Hu (“Sylvia”), Does 1 to 150, and
all persons claiming by, through or under such entities or persons, and all
persons unknown, claiming any legal or equitable right, title, estate, lien or
interest in the real property described in the complaint adverse to Plaintiff’s
title or constituting any cloud on Plaintiff’s title thereto. 
 
The operative
third-amended complaint (“TAC”) was filed on August 3, 2022, Plaintiff alleges
the following causes of action against Defendants Sylvia, Michael C. Yang
(“Yang”), Ricky Hu (“Ricky”), and CalCounties Title Nation Company
(“CalCounties”): 
 
C/A
1: Quiet Title 
C/A
2: Adverse Possession 
C/A
3: Intentional Misrepresentation 
C/A
4: Negligent Misrepresentation
C/A
5: Negligence 
C/A
6: Restitution – Unjust Enrichment 
C/A
7: Breach of Contract 
C/A
8: Negligence 
C/A
9: Indemnification 
 
Plaintiff
alleges that it is the owner of real property in Arcadia, California (the
“Property”). Sylvia
and Yang first acquired title to the Property as joint tenants by quitclaim
deed. After Sylvia and Yang acquired the Property, Sylvia
transferred the Property to Yang by quitclaim on July 7, 1997, as Yang’s sole
and separate property. Thereafter, Yang transferred the Property back to Sylvia
on June 12, 2000 by quitclaim, as her sole and separate property. When the
couple divorced in April 2008 and as part of the dissolution judgment, the
family law court awarded 58.5% of the Property to Sylvia and the remainder to
Yang. Sylvia represented that, around November 2008, she paid for Yang’s
interest in the Property and, subsequently, executed a grant deed dated
November 14, 2008, transferring the Property to herself as an unmarried woman.
Thereafter, on April 7, 2009, Sylvia transferred the Property to her nephew
Ricky as a gift, and it was later transferred back to Sylvia on June 3, 2010.
On June 11, 2010, Plaintiff received a grant deed to the Property from Sylvia
in exchange for a loan in the amount of $900,000, plus interest, which was duly
recorded due in 18 months. At the time, Plaintiff alleges Sylvia represented
that she was the sole owner of the Property. This representation was false
because Sylvia claims that she did not pay Yang for his share of the Property
until 2013. Nevertheless, the loan transaction was arranged by Central Escrow
and Sarah Shun (which Sylvia selected), and, along with Sylvia, prepared and
approved all deeds, agreements, and loan documents related to this transaction
and Property. Sylvia defaulted on the loan. Plaintiff kept the Property as
payment for the outstanding loan balance. Recently, as Plaintiff decided to
sell the Property, it discovered that title was clouded. Sylvia has refused to
execute the statement of information that is required by the title company to
clear title. 
 
On August 24,
2023, Sylvia filed a Second Amended cross-complaint against Cross-Defendants
Alta, James Mu, Chang Tsai Mu, Chang An Mu, and Mei Yun Yang, alleging the
following causes of action:
 
C/A
1: Quiet Title (Verified) 
C/A
2: Fraud (Concealment)
 
Sylvia
alleges that, following the dissolution of her marriage with Yang on May 14,
2008, the judgment awarded her with 58.5% of the Property. Thereafter, on June
1, 2010, Sylvia borrowed $900,000 from the Cross-Defendants, and she executed a
promissory note and grant deed against the Property as collateral for the loan.
Sylvia further alleges that, at the time of the execution of these documents,
she informed the Cross-Defendants that she only owned 58.8% of the Property. It
was only until several years later that Yang conveyed his interest to Sylvia.
Thus, when she defaulted on the loan, Sylvia alleges that Cross-Defendants
breached their obligations by improperly keeping the entire Property.
Furthermore, Sylvia alleges that the Cross-Defendants misrepresented that they
would accept 58.5% of the Property.
 
On November
19, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motions to Deem
Request for Admissions, Set Two, Admitted and Request for Sanctions against
Defendant Sylvia Hu. 
 
No
opposition was filed. 
 
II. ANALYSIS 
 
A.      Legal
Standard
 
When a party fails to
serve a timely response to a request for admission, the party propounding the
request for admission may move for an order to deem the genuineness of any
documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests admitted.
(Code Civ. Proc., §¿2033.280, subd. (b).) A party who fails to provide a timely
response waives any objection, including one based on privilege or work
product. (Id., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) “The court shall make this order,
unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been
directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to
the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section
2033.220. It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction… on the
party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to
requests for admission necessitated this motion.” (Id., § 2033.280,
subd. (c).)
 
B.     
Discussion
 
Plaintiff
served Request for Admissions, Set Two, on Defendant
Sylvia Hu on September 20, 2024. (Cheng Decl. ¶ 2, Exh. 1.) Defendant’s response
was due on or before October 23, 2024. Since Defendant’s counsel had filed a
motion to be relieved as Defendant’s attorney, Defendant’s counsel requested,
and Plaintiff granted, an extension to respond to the discoveries to November
5, 2024. (Cheng Decl., ¶ 3.) However, no response has been served. (Cheng Decl.,
¶ 4.) Defendant has also not filed an opposition to this motion. 
 
Therefore,
because a response has not been served, the motion is granted. The truth of the matters specified in Request for Admissions,
Set Two, are hereby deemed admitted.
 
Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions for counsel’s
work on the instant motion. Plaintiff requests a total of $2,460.00, representing
3 hours spent on the motion and 3 hours to draft a Reply and appear at the
hearing, at an hourly rate of $400, plus $60 for the filing fee. (Cheng
Decl., ¶ 5.)
 
The Court finds sanctions are warranted because
Defendant has failed to respond. However, since no opposition was filed, the
Court reduces the requested total award by $1,200, which represents three hours
of Plaintiff counsel’s hourly rate. Therefore, the Court awards sanctions in
the total amount of $1,260. 
 
III. DISPOSITION
 
Plaintiff’s
Motion to Deem Request for Admissions, Set Two, Admitted against Defendant
Sylvia Hu is GRANTED. The truth
of the matters specified in Request for Admissions, Set Two, are hereby deemed
admitted.
 
The
Court further GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions against Defendant
Sylvia Hu in the reduced amount of $1,260.00.
Said monetary sanctions are to be paid to counsel for Plaintiff within 30 days
of the date of this order. 12/19/2024
