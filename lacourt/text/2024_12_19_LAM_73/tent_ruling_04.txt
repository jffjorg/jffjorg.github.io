ANALYSIS
 
CRC Rule
9.40(d) provides that an application to be admitted pro hac vice must state the
following: (1) applicant attorney’s residence and office addresses; (2) the
courts to which the applicant attorney has been admitted and dates of
admission; (3) a representation that the attorney applicant is a member in good
standing in the courts of admission and is not currently suspended or disbarred
in any court; (4) the title of each court and action in which the applicant
attorney has appeared pro hac vice in this State in the preceding two years, if
any; and (5) the name, address, and telephone number of the active California
State Bar member who is counsel of record in the local action. (CRC Rule
9.40(d).) 
 
C.R.C., Rule 9.40(e) provides as follows, “[a]n applicant for
permission to appear as counsel pro hac vice under this rule must pay a
reasonable fee not exceeding $50 to the State Bar of California with the copy
of the application and the notice of hearing that is served on the State Bar.” 
 
Defendants’ application on behalf of Tessa
Mansfield Hirte provides the information required by C.R.C., Rule
9.40(d).  The
declarations supplied sufficient information to satisfy the requirements. (Sayre
Decl., ¶¶ 6-10; Hirte Decl., ¶¶ 1-10.) Defendant’s counsel states they have served the application for admission
on the San Francisco office of the State Bar of California with the necessary
fee. (C.R.C., Rule 9.40(e); C.R.C., Rule
9.40(c)(1).) Defendants’ application
satisfies rule 9.40. Plaintiff did not file an opposition.
 
Accordingly, Defendants’
motion for an order admitting Tessa Mansfield Hirte to appear pro
hac vice is GRANTED. 
 
DISPOSITION

 
Defendants’ Pro Hac Vice Application
of Tessa Mansfield Hirte is GRANTED.
