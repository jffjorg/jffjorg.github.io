Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the motion filed by KH Capital, LLC to charge the interest of Oscar Augusto Davila, the judgment debtor, in Collection Legion Games, LLC. The motion seeks to allow the assignee of record, KH Capital, LLC, to collect a judgment entered against Davila in favor of Mahmoud Awad in the amount of $129,937.46, plus accrued interest and post-judgment costs. The judge found that the motion was unopposed and that a charging order would create a lien on Davila's membership interest in the LLC, allowing the assignee to collect the judgment. The judge ordered that the motion be granted and that notice be given to the moving party.
