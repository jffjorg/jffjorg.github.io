Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Matrix's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against Torrance Refining Company LLC (TORC). The motion seeks to file a cross-complaint alleging causes of action for Equitable Indemnity, Contribution, Apportionment of Fault, and Declaratory Relief against TORC. The judge grants the motion, but takes oral argument on two issues: the potential impact of the belated cross-complaint on the pending dispositive motion, and why Matrix waited until October 2023 to seek leave to file the cross-complaint.

The judge notes that the policy favoring amendment and resolving all matters in the same dispute is strong, and that leave to amend is liberally permitted under California law. However, the judge also notes that the court must balance this policy with the need to avoid inexcusable delay and probable prejudice to the opposing party.

In granting the motion, the judge finds that the proposed cross-complaint arises out of the same occurrence as the original complaint, and that it is in the interest of justice to allow Matrix to file the cross-complaint. The judge also notes that TORC has failed to show how allowing Matrix to file the cross-complaint will be unduly prejudicial.
