And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and order to show cause re preliminary injunction enjoining the non-judicial foreclosure sale of his property. The plaintiff, Christian Taylor, argued that the amounts itemized in the outstanding balance statement were incorrect and that he had tendered payment in full. However, the court found that the plaintiff had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of his arguments. The court noted that the plaintiff's mortgage note provided for default interest, and that the Deed of Trust granted a power of sale only for the 311 Market Street property. The court also found that the plaintiff's tendered payment in full was not sufficient to show that he had paid off the outstanding balance in full.
