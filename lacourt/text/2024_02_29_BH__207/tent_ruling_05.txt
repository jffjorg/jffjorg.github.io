MOTION


Ex Parte Application for TRO and OSC re: Preliminary
  Injunction

EX PARTE MOTION
 
This case arises from a dispute concerning Plaintiff Christian
Taylor’s (“Plaintiff”) failure to make certain payments and ultimate default on
the mortgage on his property located at 311 Market Street.  Plaintiff contends he relied on his
then-live-in boyfriend to make the payments (using Plaintiff’s money),
including the final payoff payment, but later discovered the payments were not
actually sent to pay the mortgage.
 
Plaintiff challenges many of the amounts itemized in the outstanding
balance statement, but offered to pay the balance of the amounts.  Defendants did not accept Plaintiff’s offer
to tender payment.
 
Plaintiff now moves ex parte for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to
enjoin the nonjudicial foreclosure sale of his property, currently scheduled
for March 12, 2024, and for an order to show cause why a preliminary injunction
should not issue.
 
Defendants Investment Management Company LLC and Brian Boren oppose Plaintiff’s
ex parte application.  
 
LEGAL
STANDARDS – TRO AND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION
 
A party seeking a TRO must establish “(1) irreparable injury to the
moving party without the TRO; (2) no harm to the public interest; (3) no
substantial harm to other interested parties; 
and (4) a likelihood of prevailing on the merits.”  (Sarale v. Pacific Gas & Electric Co.
(2010) 189 Cal.App.4th 225, 243.)
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 527, subdivision (a), “[a]
preliminary injunction may be granted at any time before judgment upon a
verified complaint, or upon affidavits if the complaint in the one case, or the
affidavits in the other, show satisfactorily that sufficient grounds exist
therefor.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 527, subd. (a).) “The purpose of a preliminary
injunction is to preserve the status quo pending final resolution upon a
trial.” (Grothe v. Cortlandt Corp. (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1313, 1316.)
The status quo has been defined to mean the last actual peaceable, uncontested
status which preceded the pending controversy. (14859 Moorpark Homeowner’s
Assn. v. VRT Corp. (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1396. 1402.) Preliminary
injunctive relief requires the use of competent evidence to create a sufficient
factual showing on the grounds for relief. (See, e.g., ReadyLink Healthcare
v. Cotton (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 1006, 1016; Ancora-Citronelle Corp. v.
Green (1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 146, 150.)
 
The trial court considers two factors in determining whether to issue
a preliminary injunction: (1) the likelihood the plaintiff will prevail on the
merits of its case at trial, and (2) the interim harm the plaintiff is likely
to sustain if the injunction is denied as compared to the harm the defendant is
likely to suffer if the court grants a preliminary injunction. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 526, subd. (a).) The balancing of harm between the parties “involves
consideration of such things as the inadequacy of other remedies, the degree of
irreparable harm, and the necessity of preserving the status quo.” (Husain
v. McDonald’s Corp. (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 860, 866-67.)
 
“The decision to grant a preliminary injunction rests in the sound
discretion of the trial court ... before the trial court can exercise its
discretion the applicant must make a prima facie showing of entitlement to
injunctive relief. The applicant must demonstrate a real threat of immediate
and irreparable injury.” (Triple A Machine Shop, Inc. v. State of Cal.
(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 131, 138.) “[A]n injunction is an unusual or
extraordinary equitable remedy which will not be granted if the remedy at law
(usually damages) will adequately compensate the injured plaintiff,” and the
party seeking injunctive relief bears the burden to prove its absence. (Department
of Fish & Game v. Anderson-Cottonwood Irrigation Dist. (1992) 8
Cal.App.4th 1554, 1564-1565.)
            
ANALYSIS
 
A.   
PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS ON THE MERITS
 
A
TRO or preliminary injunction may not issue unless it is “reasonably probable
that the moving party will prevail on the merits. (San Francisco Newspaper
Printing Co., Inc. v. Superior Court (1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 438, 442; see
Costa Mesa City Employees’ Association v. City of Costa Mesa (2012) 209
Cal.App.4th 298, 309 [no injunction may issue unless there is at least “some
possibility” of success].)
 
Plaintiff
makes the following arguments as to why the requested TRO should issue: (1) Defendants
are improperly charging late charges based upon a percentage of the total
unpaid balance, in violation of California law; (2) Defendants improperly
charge the increased 18% interest from the inception of the loan, instead of
from the date the notice of default was recorded; (3) Defendants’ statement
balance mischaracterizes foreclosure and other fees as “advances” and charges
more than the statutorily-permitted amounts; (4) Defendants improperly seek to
foreclose on both of Plaintiff’s properties, 311 Market Street and 313 Market
Street, despite the fact that the Deed of Trust granted a power of sale only as
to the 311 Market Street property; and (5) when these improper amounts are
deducted from the outstanding balance, Plaintiff has tendered payment in full.  The Court analyzes each in turn.
 
a.     
Improper Late Charges
 
Plaintiff
first contends that the late charges Defendant is charging, which amount to an
additional 6% interest rate on the full unpaid balance, violates California
law.  In support, Plaintiff cites to Honchariw
v. FJM Private Mortgage Fund, LLC (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 893, 905-906;
Garrett v. Coast and Southern Federal Savings and Loan Association (1973)
9 Cal.3d 731; and Civil Code section 1671.
 
Civil
Code section 1671 provides, in relevant portion, “a provision in a contract
liquidating the damages for the breach of the contract is valid unless the
party seeking to invalidate the provision establishes that the provision was
unreasonable under the circumstances existing at the time the contract was made.”  (Civ. Code, § 1671, subd. (b).)
 
Honchariw
and
Garrett both stand for the proposition that a late fee charged
for making a single late payment, as a percentage of the total outstanding loan
balance, is unreasonable.  However, Honcariw
specifically notes that, “[D]efault interest following note maturity has
long been allowed in California without resort to a liquidated damages
analysis.”  (83 Cal.Ap.5th at
905, fn. 8.)
 
Paragraph
6 of Plaintiff’s mortgage note provides:
 
IF BORROWER IS IN DEFAULT UNDER THIS NOTE…, AND
THE NOTE HOLDER HAS RECORDED A NOTICE OF DEFAULT …, THEN THE ENTIRE UNPAID
PRINCIPAL BALANCE SHALL AUTOMATICALLY BEAR AN ANNUAL INTEREST RATE (INSTEAD OF
THE RATE SPECIFIED IN PARAGRAPH 3) EQUAL TO THE LESSER OF (A) SIX PERCENTAGE
POINTS (6%) PER ANNUM ABOVE THE RATE OF INTEREST OTHERWISE APPLICABLE
THEREUNDER, OR (B) THE MAXIMUM INTEREST RATE ALLOWED BY LAW (THE “DEFAULT
RATE”).
 
(Ex.
A to Taylor Decl.)
 
            Thus, the additional 6% being
charged is default interest, not a late charge for a single missed
payment.  Thus, Plaintiff has not
demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits that the additional 6%
interest is prohibited by California law.
 
b.     
Charges In Excess of Those Agreed
 
Plaintiff
next contends that the charges exceed those agreed to in the note because
Defendants are charging the increased interest on all outstanding payments,
from the inception of the loan, not just those payments after the notice of
default.
 
The
note provides:
 
IF BORROWER IS IN DEFAULT UNDER THIS NOTE…, AND THE
NOTE HOLDER HAS RECORDED A NOTICE OF DEFAULT…, THEN THE ENTIRE UNPAID PRINCIPAL
BALANCE SHALL AUTHOMATICALLY BEAR AN ANNUAL INTEREST RATE (INSTEAD OF THE RATE
SPECIFIED IN PARAGRAPH 3) EQUAL TO THE LESSER OF (A) SIX PERCENTAGE POITNS (6%)
PER ANNUM ABOVE THE RATE OF INTEREST OTHERWISE APPLICABLE THEREUNDER, OR (B)
THE MAXIMUM INTEREST RATE ALLOWED BY LAW (THE “DEFAULT RATE”)
 
Thus,
pursuant to the note, the increased interest rate applies to “the entire unpaid
principal balance” not just the payments due after the notice of default is
recorded.
 
Therefore,
Plaintiff has not demonstrated a likelihood of prevailing on the merits of his
argument that the increased interest rate exceeds the terms of the note.
 
c.      
Advances
 
Plaintiff
next argues that Defendants’ ledger claims $18,758.11 for “Advance[s]” owed on
the loan that relate to foreclosure, forbearance, processing, and regulation
fees and costs that exceed those allowable pursuant to Civil Code sections
2924c-2924d.
 
Those
sections limit the types of foreclosure costs that can be recovered, and limit
the amount of trustee’s or attorney’s fees that may be recovered.  
 
However,
Plaintiff has not demonstrated that the requested $18,758.11 includes types of
costs that are not allowable or include trustee’s or attorney’s fees in excess
of those allowed by statute.
 
Therefore,
Plaintiff has not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits that the
$18,758.11 in “Advance[s]” are improper.
 
d.     
Foreclosure on Both of Plaintiff’s
Properties
 
Plaintiff
contends the Deed of Trust granted Defendants the power of sale with respect to
the 311 Market property only, yet Defendants now seek to improperly foreclose
on both 311 Market and the adjacent property, 313 Market, which Plaintiff also
owns.
 
The
Deed of Trust, dated July 5, 2018, grants a power of sale in the property
associated with APN: 4238-009-006 “which has the address of 311 Market Street
(Venice area) Los Angeles CA 90291.  (Ex.
B to Taylor Decl.)  The Notice of Default
and Notice of Trustee’s Sale reference “APN: OLD: 4238-009-006 NEW:
4238-009-024[.]”  (Exs. C-D to Taylor
Decl.)  Thus, it appears the parcel
number for the property in which Plaintiff granted the power of sale has
changed since the Deed of Trust was executed. 
But there is nothing on the face of the Notice of Default or Notice of
Trustee’s Sale or any other evidence demonstrating that Defendants are
improperly foreclosing on property they are not entitled to foreclose upon.
 
Therefore
Plaintiff has not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits that
Defendants have improperly noticed a trustee’s sale on a property they are not
entitled to foreclose upon.
 
e.      
Plaintiff Tendered the Outstanding Balance
 
Plaintiff
contends that although Defendants demand a payoff amount of $192,440.58, the outstanding
amount Defendants may lawfully demand does not exceed $60,000, once the
deductions are made in accordance with Plaintiff’s arguments above.  Plaintiff further contends that Plaintiff
tendered $60,000 to Defendants, thus Plaintiff has tendered the outstanding
balance in full and Defendants may not lawfully foreclose upon the property.
 
Because
the Court finds Plaintiff has not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the
merits that the outstanding balance owed exceeds that which Defendants may
lawfully collect, Plaintiff has similarly not demonstrated a likelihood of
success on the merits that Plaintiff’s tendering of $60,000 paid off the
lawfully-allowed outstanding balance in full. 

 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, because the Court finds that Plaintiff has not demonstrated
a likelihood of success on the merits, the Court denies Plaintiff’s motion for
a temporary restraining order and order to show cause re preliminary injunction
enjoining the March 12, 2024 foreclosure sale of Plaintiff’s property.
