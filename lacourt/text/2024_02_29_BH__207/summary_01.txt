And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer to answer filed by Keyway Pride Limited LLC (Plaintiff) against Chicago Title Company (Defendant). The Plaintiff demurred to the Defendant's Answer, alleging that it failed to state facts sufficient to cause a defense. The Defendant opposed the demurrer, and the Court has analyzed the pleadings.

The Court finds that the Defendant's Answer is defective in form, as it is an unverified answer to a verified complaint. Therefore, the Court strikes the Answer as improper. The Court also finds that the Defendant failed to meet its burden of showing how the pleading could be amended to state an affirmative defense.

As a result, the Court grants the Defendant leave to file a code-compliant Answer. The Defendant has up to and including March 20, 2024, to file and serve the new Answer. The Plaintiff is required to provide notice of the Court's ruling and file a proof of service regarding the same.
