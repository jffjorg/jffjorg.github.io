  Case Number:  21STCV45858    Hearing Date:   January 21, 2025    Dept:  71 Palmer v. White Memorial Medical Center
21STCV45858

Issue of Nondelegable Duty

­­­­­­­­­­­­            The
parties asked the Court for direction on the issue of whether Defendant, White
Memorial Medical Center, would be vicariously liable for any alleged negligence
by its property manager, Jones, Lang, LaSalle, and each submitted briefs on the
issue.  Plaintiff, Shubert Palmer, contends
White Memorial is vicariously liable for any alleged negligence by its property
manager, Jones, Lang, LaSalle.  (Plaintiff’s
brief, 1:1-12.)  The Court agrees.  A possessor of land owes a nondelegable duty to
others to put and maintain its property in reasonably safe condition.  The possessor is, therefore, liable for harm
caused by a negligent failure of its contractors to put or maintain the
buildings and structures in reasonably safe condition, no matter how carefully the
contractors were selected.  (Srithong
v. Total Investment Co. (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 721, 726.)
Defendant, White Memorial, agrees
that it is vicariously liable for any alleged negligence by, Jones, Lang, LaSalle
arising out of its management of White Memorial’s property.  (Defendant’s brief, 1:1-11.)  Defendant contends, however, that because it
is vicariously liable for any negligence by Jones, Lang, LaSalle, it is
entitled to an offset for the entirety of the settlement ($1,950,000) Jones,
Lang, LaSalle and Plaintiff entered into. 
(Defendant’s brief, 2:11-4:6.)  The
Court agrees.  A defendant vicariously liable
for another defendant is to be given full credit for any settlement made by the
defendant for whom the non-settling defendant is vicariously liable.  (Schreiber v. Lee (2020) 47
Cal.App.5th 745, 760.)
In light of these rulings, the
Court suggests that Jones, Lang, LaSalle need not be listed on the Verdict Form,
so unless there is any other differences between them, the Court is inclined to
use Plaintiff’s version.  21STCV455858
