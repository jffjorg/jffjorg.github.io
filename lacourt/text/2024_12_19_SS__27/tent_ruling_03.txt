CASE NO./NAME: 23STCV09150 ERIK
ALCATRAZ-GONZALEZ, et al. vs JOSE LUIS AGUIRRE
Moving Party: Defendant Jose Luis Aguirre 
Responding Party: Plaintiff¿ 
Notice: Sufficient
 
Ruling: GRANT
Written
Discovery
On June 12, 2024,
Defendant Jose Luis Aguirre served Form and Special Interrogatories, and
Requests for Production of Documents (Set One of each) on Plaintiff Melissa
Silva.
On July 9, 2024,
Plaintiff’s counsel requested and received a two-week extension to respond by July 30, 2024. On July 19, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel advised Defendant that they could not contact Plaintiff. On July 30, 2024, Plaintiff requested and received a second extension to provide the
responses at issue by August 13, 2024.
After August 13,
2024, Plaintiff made no further extension requests, nor were any further
extensions granted. As
of date of filing, Defendant has not received the discovery responses at issue and now moves the Court to compel initial responses.
It is undisputed
that responses were not provided before the statutory deadline. No opposition
or any
other filing indicates that responses were
provided before the hearing. The motion is therefore
granted. Plaintiff Melissa Silva is ordered to provide complete and verified
responses to Defendant Jose Luis Aguirre’s Form Interrogatories, Special
Interrogatories, and Requests for Production (Set One) without objections
within 20 days of this order.
Deposition
On July 9, 2024,
Defendant served the first notice of deposition for Plaintiff Melissa Silva,
scheduled for July 30, 2024. On July 19, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel advised they
had not had contact with Plaintiff for approximately two months and objected to
the deposition based on unavailability and unilateral scheduling, but stated
that Plaintiff would provide available dates. On July 30, 2024, Defendant
granted Plaintiff a second discovery extension provide Plaintiff’s availability by August 13, 2024. To date, Defendant has not received any
dates of availability from Plaintiff. It appears that no such date can be
provided as Plaintiff’s counsel has not had contact
with Plaintiff since approximately May 2024. 
Defendant has met
the requirements to compel Plaintiff’s deposition under Code of Civil Procedure section
2025.450, and the Court received no opposition
from Plaintiff’s counsel. The motion is granted, and Plaintiff is ordered to
appear for her deposition within 20 days of this order.
Sanctions
Defendant requests $690 in sanctions for each motion. The
Court finds sanctions appropriate as Plaintiff did not act with substantial
justification. Sanctions in the amount of $2,000 are ordered against Plaintiff
only, payable to Defendant within 20 days of today.
