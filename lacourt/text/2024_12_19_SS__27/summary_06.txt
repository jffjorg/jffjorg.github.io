And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to transfer the venue of the case from Los Angeles County to San Bernardino County. The case arises from a motor vehicle accident that allegedly occurred on October 6, 2021, in San Bernardino County. The Defendant, Silvia Janet Flores, seeks to transfer the venue to San Bernardino County, where she resided at the time the action was commenced and where the accident occurred. The Judge finds that venue is proper in San Bernardino County under California Code of Civil Procedure § 395(a). The Plaintiffs have failed to oppose the motion, which is deemed a waiver of all arguments raised. The Judge orders the Defendant to give notice of the transfer and advises the parties that if they submit on the tentative and do not appear at the hearing, the opposing party may still appear and argue the matter.
