And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is on a motion to compel a mental examination of the plaintiff, Maria Elena Espinoza, by the defendants, Luis Cornejo and On Track Transportation, Inc. The motion is based on a notice of demand for an independent medical examination (IME) served on the plaintiff on June 12, 2024.

The judge finds that the defendants have shown good cause for the examination and that the plaintiff has placed her mental condition in controversy. The plaintiff failed to appear at a previously scheduled IME and did not validly object to the examination. The judge also finds that the defendants properly attempted to meet and confer with the plaintiff's counsel before filing the motion.

The judge conditionally grants the motion to compel the mental examination, subject to the defendants filing a compliant proposed order specifying the diagnostic tests and procedures to be employed by December 23, 2024.

The judge also awards sanctions against the plaintiff in the amount of $3,535, including $1,160 in attorney fees and costs, $2,375 in no-show fees, and $575 in Spanish interpreter fees. The sanctions are jointly and severally against the plaintiff and her counsel and are to be paid within 30 days.
