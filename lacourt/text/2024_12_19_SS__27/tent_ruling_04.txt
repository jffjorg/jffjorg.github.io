INTRODUCTION
This
is an action arising from Plaintiff Edwin Zepeda (“Plaintiff”) allegedly
sustaining injuries when fireworks exploded on the 700 Block of East 27th
Street, Los Angeles, CA 90011 on June 30, 2021. 
On
June 8, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendants City of Los
Angeles (“City”), County of Los Angeles (“County”), and Does 1-50, inclusive,
alleging causes of action for general negligence and liability for wrongful act
or omissions by public entity employees.  
On
June 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”),
which added the Los Angeles Police Department (“LAPD”) as a defendant and
asserts the same causes of action articulated in the initial complaint. The FAC
is set forth on a Judicial Council Form PLD-PI-001. According to the FAC,
Plaintiff’s negligence claim is based on an alleged wrongful act or omission by
public employees under Gov. Code § 815.2, et seq. and a dangerous
condition on public property under Gov. Code § 835. 
The
FAC alleges, in part, that Defendants “and each of them, negligently hired,
trained, supervised, monitored and/or employed their employees, who
negligently, carelessly, and recklessly attempted to detonate fireworks in a
public street. Defendants, and each of them, knew in the course of reasonable
care and inspection, and/or should have known, that the number and amount of
explosive fireworks would cause a dangerous and massive explosion in a public
neighborhood. Defendants, and each of them, knew that the detonation of
fireworks should have been done in a safer area and not in a public street, or
in a local neighborhood, where injuries and damages would occur.” (FAC at p.
4.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendants continued to detonate explosive fireworks
without proper containment and, as such, he “suffered physical and mental
injuries as a result of Defendants detonating a massive amount of fireworks.”
(FAC at p. 4.) Plaintiff alleges that he has complied with the applicable
claims statutes. (FAC at p. 2.) 
On
July 12, 2023, Defendant County filed an answer. 
On
January 9, 2024, the Court granted the motion of Gary A. Dordick and Nicholas
I. Myers to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff. (01/09/24 Minute Order.) 
On
March 14, 2024, Defendants City and LAPD filed a joint answer to the complaint.[1]

On
April 24, 2024, the Court granted Defendant County’s motion to compel
Plaintiff’s further responses to form and special interrogatories; requests for
production of documents; and requests for admissions. (04/24/24 Minute Order.)
Plaintiff was ordered to provide further responses, without objections, to
Defendant County’s form interrogatories, special interrogatories, request for
production of documents, and request for admissions within 30 days of service
of the notice of ruling. (04/24/24 Minute Order at p. 1.) Plaintiff was also
ordered to pay monetary sanctions of $1,375.00 to Defendant County within 30
days of service of the notice of ruling. (04/24/24 Minute Order at p. 1.) 
On
April 30, 2024, Defendant County filed and served notice of the Court’s April
24, 2024 order. 
On
July 2, 2024, Defendant County filed and served the instant motion for summary
judgment, or in the alternative, for summary adjudication of issues (the
“Motion”). Defendant County moves for summary judgment in its favor on the
grounds that there are no genuine issues of material fact. (Not. of Mot. at p.
2:3-7.) 
On
September 20, 2024, the Court granted Defendant County’s motion to deem its
request for admissions as admitted. (09/20/24 Minute Order at p. 1.)
On
November 6, 2024, after hearing, the Court granted Defendant County’s motion to
continue trial. (11/06/24 Minute Order at p. 1.) The Court continued non-jury
trial from December 5, 2024, to March 3, 2025. (11/06/24 Minute Order at p. 1.)
The Court advanced the May 9, 2025 hearing date on the Motion and continued the
hearing to December 19, 2024. (11/06/24 Minute Order at p. 1.) 
On
November 7, 2024, Defendant County filed and served a notice of ruling as to
the Court’s November 6, 2024 order. 
As
of December 17, 2024, the Motion is unopposed. Any opposition to the Motion was
required to have been filed and served at least nine court days prior to the
hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) The Motion was served on
Plaintiff and Defendant City via mail and e-mail. The Court informs Plaintiff
that “[a] failure to oppose a motion may be deemed a consent to the granting of
a motion.” (Cal. R. Ct., Rule 8.54(c).) Although Plaintiff is currently
self-represented, self-represented litigants “are held to the same standards as
attorneys.” (Kobayashi v. Superior Court (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 536,
543.) 
          
II.      LEGAL STANDARD
The function of a motion for summary
judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing
party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an
order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code
Civ. Proc. § 437c(c) “requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all
the evidence submitted, and all inferences reasonably deducible from the
evidence and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is
no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled
to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler
v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function
of the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of
the issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose
whether there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the
pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento
(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67.)
“As to each claim as framed by the
complaint, the defendant moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial
burden of proof by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to
establish a defense.” (Scalf v. D. B. Log
Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Courts “liberally construe
the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve
doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.”  (Dore
v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.) Once the defendant
has met its burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable
issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a
defense thereto. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co., supra, 25
Cal.4th 826, 849.)  “[T]he plaintiff must
produce substantial responsive evidence sufficient to establish a triable issue
of material fact on the merits.” (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 151, 163.) 
A cause of action has no merit if a
defendant establishes an affirmative defense to that cause of action. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (o)(2).) “A plaintiff’s factually devoid discovery
responses may be used to shift the burden of production onto the plaintiff when
the logical inference is that the plaintiff possesses no facts to support his
or her claims.” (Bayramoglu v. Nationstar Mortgage (2020) 51 Cal.App.5th
726, 733.) “A defendant seeking to prevail on this ground must make an affirmative
showing that the plaintiff does not possess, and cannot reasonably obtain,
evidence to prove his or her case.” (Silva v. See’s Candy Shops, Inc. (2016)
7 Cal.App.5th 235, 246.) 
 
 
 
III.    DISCUSSION 
Judicial Notice 
          Defendant
County requests that the Court take judicial notice of the declaration of
Katherine Medina, Deputy Clerk of the Board of Supervisors for the County of
Los Angeles, which attests that “as of July 10, 2023, the County of Los Angeles
has no record of a Government Claim or Late Claim Application being filed by
Plaintiff . . . .” (Request for Judicial Notice at p. 2:1-4.)   
“If a plaintiff alleges compliance with
the claims presentation requirement, but the public records do not reflect
compliance, the governmental entity can request the court to take judicial
notice under Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (c) that the entity’s
records do not show compliance.” (Gong v. City of Rosemead (2014) 226
Cal.App.4th 363, 376.) 
          The Court
GRANTS Defendant County’s request for judicial notice. (Evid. Code §§ 452,
453.) 
Issue No. 1: Plaintiff’s Failure to Comply with the
Government Claims Act 
          “Suits for
money or damages filed against a public entity are regulated by . . . the
Government Claims Act.” (DiCampli-Mintz v. County of Santa Clara (2012)
55 Cal.4th 983, 989.) “Claims for personal injury and property damage must be
presented within six months after accrual; all other claims must be presented
within a year.” (Id. at p. 990.) “[N]o suit for money or damages may be
brought against a public entity on a cause of action for which a claim is
required to be presented . . . until a written claim therefor has been
presented to the public entity and has been acted upon . . . or has been deemed
to have been rejected . . . .” (Ibid., internal quotations omitted.) 
“[F]ailure to present a claim for money
or damages to a public entity bars a plaintiff from filing a lawsuit against
that entity.” (Ibid., internal quotations omitted, emphasis added.)
A county is deemed a local public entity. (Ibid.) “The filing of a claim
is a condition precedent to the maintenance of any cause of action against the
public entity and is therefore an element that a plaintiff is required
to provide in order to prevail.” (Ibid., emphasis in original.) A claim
is presented to a public entity “by [d]elivering it to the clerk, secretary or
auditor, or by mailing it to one of these officials or to the governing body.”
(Id. at p. 986.) Even a claim which is misdirected is “deemed to
have been presented in compliance . . . if [i]t is actually received by the
clerk, secretary, auditor or board of the local public entity.” (Ibid.,
emphasis in original.) 
Defendant County’s Evidence 
Defendant County presents the following
undisputed material facts in support of its motion for summary judgment:
Plaintiff alleges the date of his injury and damages as June 30, 2021.
(Defendant County’s Separate Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (DSUMF) No.
1.) As of July 10, 2023, more than two years post-incident, Defendant County
had no record of a government claim filed under the name Edwin Zepeda. (DSUMF
No. 2.) As of July 10, 2023, Defendant County had no application for leave to
file a late claim under the name Edwin Zepeda. (DSUMF No. 3.) As of July 10,
2023, Defendant County had no record of correspondence under the name Edwin
Zepeda. (DSUMF No. 4.) Plaintiff has no evidence to prove that he presented a
government claim to Defendant County for the injuries and damages he alleges as
a result of the incident set forth in his complaint. (DSUMF No. 5.) 
In support of the Motion, Amber A.
Logan (“Logan”), provides a supplemental declaration. Ms. Logan states the
following: on September 20, 2024, the Court granted Defendant County’s motion
to deem the facts set forth in Set One of Defendant County’s Requests for
Admission as admitted. (Logan Supp. Decl., ¶ 7; Ex. 9.) As a result of such
order, Plaintiff has admitted, among other facts, that he did not present a
government claim to Defendant County prior to filing the complaint and has no
evidence to prove that he submitted a government claim to Defendant County
prior to filing the complaint; he did not comply with the Government Claims Act
and has no evidence to prove compliance; and that Defendant County did not
cause the injuries Plaintiff sustained as a result of the incident. (Logan
Supp. Decl., ¶ 8.)  
Analysis 
Defendant County has shown that
Plaintiff failed to comply with the Government Claims Act. The burden now
shifts to Plaintiff to show a triable issue of material fact.
Given that the Motion is unopposed,
Plaintiff has not shown a triable issue of material fact. Since Plaintiff
failed to present any evidence as to his compliance with the Government Claims
Act, Defendant County has shown a complete defense to this action and summary
judgment is appropriate. (DiCampli-Mintz v. County of Santa Clara, supra,
55 Cal.4th 983, 989.) 
Due to the Court’s analysis above, the
Court need not address Defendant County’s arguments that: (1) Plaintiff has no
evidence to prove the essential elements of his causes of action for negligence
or dangerous condition of public property; and (2) Plaintiff’s factually devoid
discovery responses entitle Defendant County to summary judgment as a matter of
law. 
The Court need not address such
arguments because Plaintiff’s failure to show a triable issue of material fact
on the claim presentation issue bars any cause of action against Defendant
County as “[t]he filing of a claim is . . . an element that a plaintiff
is required to prove in order to prevail.” (DiCampli-Mintz, supra,
55 Cal.4th 983, 990, emphasis in original.) Defendant has therefore shown that
Plaintiff cannot prevail on any cause of action asserted in the FAC. Also,
Plaintiff’s failure to oppose the Motion is deemed a waiver to all arguments
raised therein as “[c]ontentions are waived when a party fails to support them
with reasoned argument and citations to authority.” (Moulton Niguel Water
Dist. v. Colombo (2009) 111 Cal.App.4th 1210, 1215.)
