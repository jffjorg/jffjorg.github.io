inclusive for (1) negligence and (2) premises liability. The Complaint alleges
that on or about May 29, 2021, Defendants negligently maintained the property
located at 3960-3962 Landmark Street, Culver City, CA (“Premises”) causing

II.         
LEGAL STANDARD
“A party seeking to advance, specially set, or
reset a case for trial must make this request by noticed motion or ex parte
application under the rules in chapter 4 of this division.” (Cal. Rules of Ct.,
rule 3.1335, subd. (a).) “The request may be granted only upon an affirmative
showing by the moving party of good cause based on a declaration served and
filed with the motion or application.” (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1335, subd.
(b).)
III.       
DISCUSSION
Defendant 1661, Inc. dba GOAT (“GOAT”) moves
for an order specially setting its renewed Motion for Summary Judgment or,
Alternatively, Summary Adjudication (“MSJ”) to be heard on January 6, 2025
instead of June 18, 2025. Alternatively, GOAT requests an order continuing
trial in this matter for 30-days (July 18, 2025) after the hearing on the renewed
MSJ. 
Pursuant to California Rules of Court, Rule
3.1332(c): the court may grant a continuance for “good cause,” which includes:
(1) unavailability of an essential lay or expert witness due to death, illness,
or other excusable circumstances; (2) unavailability of a party due to death,
illness, or other excusable circumstances; (3) unavailability of trial counsel
due to death, illness, or other excusable circumstances; (4) substitution of
trial counsel required in the interests of justice; (5) addition of a new party
or other parties in regard to a new party’s involvement hasn’t had a reasonable
opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial; (6) party’s excused
inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence
despite diligent efforts; or (7) significant, unanticipated change in the
status of the case as a result of which indicates the case is not ready for
trial. (Cal. Rules Ct., Rule 3.1332(c).)¿¿ 
¿¿Other relevant factors to be considered may
include: “(1) the proximity of the trial date; (2) whether there was any
previous continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to any party;
(3) the length of the continuance requested; (4) the availability of
alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the motion or
application for a continuance; (5) the prejudice that parties or witnesses will
suffer as a result of the continuance; (6) if the case is entitled to a
preferential trial setting, the reasons for that status and whether the need
for a continuance outweighs the need to avoid delay; (7) the court’s calendar
and the impact of granting a continuance on other pending trials; (8) whether
trial counsel is engaged in another trial; (9) whether all parties have
stipulated to a continuance; (10) whether the interests of justice are best
served by a continuance, by the trial of the matter, or by imposing conditions
on the continuance; and (11) any other fact or circumstance relevant to the
fair determination of the motion or application” (Cal. Rules Ct., Rule
3.1332(d).)¿¿ 
¿¿“A trial court has great discretion in the
disposition of an application for a continuance. Absent a clear abuse of
discretion, the court’s determination will not be disturbed.” (Estate of
Smith v. Atkinson (1973) 9 Cal.3d 74, 81.) “Such discretion is abused,
however, where the lack of a continuance results in the denial of a fair
hearing.” (Rankin v. Curtis (1986) 183 Cal.App.3d 939, 947.)¿
GOAT argues good cause exists to advance the
hearing of its renewed MSJ or continue trial to accommodate the currently set
hearing date because the renewed MSJ was timely filed after Plaintiff produced
new evidence that was not in GOAT’s possession at the time of the filing of the
prior MSJ. 
Although addressing the merits of the renewed
MSJ would be improper here, the Court notes there is statutory authority that
permits renewal of a prior MSJ upon a showing of newly discovered facts or
circumstances, or a change of law. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (f)(2)
stating, “A party shall not move for summary judgment based on issues asserted
in a prior motion for summary adjudication and denied by the court unless that
party establishes, to the satisfaction of the court, newly discovered facts or
circumstances or a change of law supporting the issues reasserted in the
summary judgment motion.”) Furthermore, GOAT filed and served its renewed MSJ
on October 14, 2024, which is within the 75-day notice requirement for filing
such motion. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (a)(2).) However, a motion for
summary judgment must be heard no later than 30 days before trial. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 437c, subd. (a)(3).) As stated above, the renewed MSJ is currently set
for hearing four months after the jury trial. Also, GOAT reserved the first
available hearing date for the renewed MSJ.  Having filed no opposition to this Motion,
Plaintiff has not indicated that it would suffer prejudice by advancing the
hearing of the renewed MSJ. The related Motion for Reconsideration is already
set for January 6, 2025. In the interest of judicial economy, hearing both
motions simultaneously appears to be appropriate.  However, to address timing issues arising
from changes to the summary judgment law, the Court will discuss the Motion
with the parties.
