STATEMENT OF
MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
The dispute arises from the lease of the real property located
at 5622 Keniston Ave. Los Angeles CA, 90043. Plaintiff files the instant action
against Defendant to recover rent paid based on alleged defects with the
property not disclosed at the time of the creation of the parties’
landowner/tenant relationship. 
            On May 14, 2024, Defendant/Cross-Complainant filed
the instant motion for an order deeming his Requests for Admission, Set One, as
admitted based on Plaintiff’s failure to respond under Code of Civil Procedure
§ 2033.280. Plaintiff filed his opposition on June 28, 2024. No reply has been
filed. 
 
TENTATIVE
RULING:
 
Defendant/Cross-Complainant Collin Hinds’s Motion for an Order Establishing Admissions is
DENIED as MOOT.
 
Request for Sanctions is DENIED.  
 
 
DISCUSSION:
 
Request
for Admissions
 
Legal Standard
 
A party must respond to requests for admissions
within 30 days after service of such requests. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.250,
subd. (a).)  “If a party to whom requests for admission are directed fails
to serve a timely response…(a) [that party] waives any objection to the
requests, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work
product…” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) “The requesting party may
move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any
matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7.” (Id. at subd. (b).)  A motion dealing
with the failure to respond, rather than with inadequate responses, does not
require the requesting party to meet and confer with the responding party. (Deymer
v. Costa Mesa Mobile Home Estates (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 393, 395, fn. 4
[disapproved on other grounds in Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 Cal.4th
973]). There is no time limit within which a motion to have matters deemed
admitted must be made. (Brigante v. Huang (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 1569,
1585.)
Analysis  
Defendant provides the declaration of his counsel, Alain V. Bonavida,
who states that he served Plaintiff with Defendant’s Request for Admissions,
Set One (RFAs) via overnight delivery on April 2, 2024. (Bonavida Decl. ¶ 3;
Exh. A.) The request was delivered to Plaintiff on April 3, 2024. (Id.;
Exh. B.) Counsel swears that as of the filing of the instant motion, no
responses have been received.  (Id.
¶ 4.) 
Plaintiff’s opposition declaration states that he did not receive
Defendant’s discovery request but did receive two USPS packages, one of which contained
the instant motion. (Worthen Decl. ¶ 1.) By the time he filed his opposition, however,
Plaintiff had responded to the RFAs. (Id. ¶ 3; Exh. A.)
Based on Plaintiff’s declaration, the motion appears to be moot under
CCP § 2033.280(c) as Plaintiff has provided his responses to the request for
admissions compliant with CCP §2033.220.  Defendant has not filed a reply challenging
the responses. Therefore, the Court finds the motion to be moot. 
Sanctions 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision (a)
provides, in pertinent part, that the court may impose a monetary sanction on a
party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process to pay the reasonable
expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone because of that
conduct. A misuse of the discovery process includes failing to respond or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010,
subd. (d).) Furthermore, it is “mandatory that the Court impose a monetary
sanction…on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely
response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
 
Defendant requests $3,150.02 be issued as a monetary
sanction against Plaintiff. (Bonavida Decl. ¶ 5.) While the filing of late
response does not negate the Court’s discretion to issue monetary sanctions,
sanction in this case would be unwarranted as Plaintiff swears under penalty of
perjury that his failure to respond timely was through no fault of his own.
(Worthen Decl. ¶ 5.) Therefore, the Court declines to issue sanctions in this
case. 
 
Accordingly, Defendant/Cross-Complainant
Collin Hinds’s Motion for an Order Establishing Admissions is DENIED as
MOOT.
 
Request for Sanctions is DENIED
 
Moving party to give notice, unless waived.  
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
