And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling by Judge Theresa M. Traber is that the motion for an order establishing admissions and for sanctions filed by Defendant/Cross-Complainant Collin Hinds is denied as moot. The motion was filed on May 14, 2024, requesting that the Court deem his Requests for Admission, Set One, as admitted due to Plaintiff's failure to respond. However, Plaintiff has since responded to the requests for admission, making the motion moot. The Court also denied the request for sanctions, as Plaintiff swore under penalty of perjury that his failure to respond timely was through no fault of his own.
