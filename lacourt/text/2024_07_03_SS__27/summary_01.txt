And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion for summary judgment and dismissing the plaintiff's claims. The defendant, Commerce Casino, argued that it was not in a joint venture or agency relationship with Coach Max Corp, and therefore, the plaintiff's claims against it are barred by the statute of limitations.

The judge found that the defendant has met its initial burden to establish that it was not in a joint venture with Coach Max Corp, as there was no evidence of shared profits or joint control between the two companies. The judge also found that the plaintiff did not raise a triable issue of fact regarding a joint venture or agency relationship.

The judge further found that the plaintiff did not address the defendant's argument that the plaintiff should not be allowed to relate back to the original filing, and therefore, the defendant's affirmative defense of statute of limitations is valid.

As a result, the judge granted the motion for summary judgment and dismissed the plaintiff's claims against the defendant.
