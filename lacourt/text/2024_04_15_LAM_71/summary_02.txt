And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court denies the plaintiff's default judgment packet and sets a hearing on an order to show cause why the complaint should not be dismissed and/or the plaintiff's counsel should not be sanctioned $250 for failing to enter default judgment. The court's decision is based on two reasons: first, the request for default judgment does not properly seek an amount that is equal to or less than the amount sought in the prayer for the complaint or C.C.P. ยง425.11 statement of damages. Second, the plaintiff seeks punitive damages but does not provide evidence of the defendant's wealth, which is required by law.
