         vs.
 
EMMANUEL
  J. DELACRUZ.


 Case No.: 
  23STCV10214
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  April 15, 2024



 
The Court
denies Plaintiff’s default judgment packet. 

The Court sets a hearing on an order to show cause why the complaint
should not be dismissed and/or Plaintiff’s counsel sanctioned $250 for failing
to enter default judgment (California Rule of Court, rule 3.110(h)) on July 1,
2024, at 8:30 AM in Department 71 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse for the following
reasons:

The
     request for court judgment does not properly seek an amount that is equal
     to or less than the amount sought in the prayer for the complaint or
     C.C.P. §425.11 statement of damages. 
     (See, e.g., Falahati v. Kondo (2005) 127
     Cal.App.4th 823, 830-831 [stating court acts in excess of its jurisdiction
     and the resulting default judgment is void if the court awards default
     judgment in an amount greater than that demanded in the complaint,
     including if the complaint does not specify the amount demanded].)  

 
2.    
Plaintiff
seeks punitive damage but does not provide evidence of the defendant’s wealth.
An award of punitive damages requires evidence as to the defendant’s wealth.  (Devlin
v. Kearny Mesa AMC (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 381, 390; Adams v. Murakami (1991) 54 Cal.3d 105, 118.)
