1.    
Motion to Compel FROG- Ben
Having reviewed Plaintiff’s unopposed Motion to Compel Responses
from Ben to Plaintiff’s FROG, the Court rules as follows.
          On June 12, 2024,
Plaintiff served FROG on Ben.  (Decl. of Brault
¶3, Exh. 1.)  Ben’s responses were due on
July 24, 2024, but Ben did not serve responses on Plaintiff.  (Decl. of Brault ¶6.)  Plaintiff’s counsel wrote to Ben’s counsel on
July 23 and 26, 2024, asking for responses; Plaintiff’s counsel did not receive
a reply from Ben’s counsel.  (Decl. of Brault
¶7, Exhs. 2, 3.)  As of the date of this
hearing, Plaintiff has not received responses to its FROG from Ben.   (Decl. of Brault ¶7.)  Plaintiff now moves to compel responses to
the FROG.
Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses is granted pursuant to C.C.P. §2030.290(b).  Ben is ordered to provide verified responses
to Plaintiff’s FROG compliant with C.C.P. §§2030.210(a) and 2030.220 without
objections within 20 days.
Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions totaling $1,860.00 against Ben and/or his counsel.  Since
the instant motion is unopposed, the Court declines to grant sanctions for
anticipated fees for reviewing the opposition and preparing a reply.  Further, since the instant motion
is substantially similar in content to the motion to deem admitted RFA, the
Court declines to grant additional fees for Plaintiff’s counsel’s appearance at
the hearing because fees for preparation of the motion should compensate for
these costs.
          The
Court awards sanctions pursuant to C.C.P. §2030.290(c) in the amount of $660.00,
calculated as follows:
(1.5 hours to prepare
instant motion x $400.00) + $60.00 filing fee = $660.00

The sanctions are payable by
Ben and his attorney, jointly and severally, within 20 days of this order.
Moving Party is to give
notice of this ruling. 
 
2.    
Motion to Compel RFP- Ben

but Ben did not serve responses on Plaintiff. 
(Decl. of Brault ¶5.)  Plaintiff’s
counsel wrote to Ben’s counsel on July 23 and 26, 2024, asking for responses;
Plaintiff’s counsel did not receive a reply from Ben’s counsel.  (Decl. of Brault ¶6, Exhs. 2, 3.)  As of the date of this hearing, Plaintiff has
not received responses to its RFP from Ben.  
(Decl. of Brault ¶6.)  Plaintiff
now moves to compel responses to the RFP.
Plaintiff’s motion to compel
responses is granted pursuant to C.C.P. §2031.300(b).  Ben is
ordered to provide verified responses to Plaintiff’s RFP and produce documents
compliant with C.C.P. §§2031.300(a) and 2031.210 without objections within 20
days.
Plaintiff requests monetary
sanctions totaling $1,860.00 against Ben and/or his
counsel.  Since the instant motion is
unopposed, the Court declines to grant sanctions for anticipated fees for
reviewing the opposition and preparing a reply.  Further, since the instant motion is
substantially similar in content to the motion to deem admitted RFA and motion
to compel FROG, the Court declines to grant additional fees for Plaintiff’s
counsel’s appearance at the hearing because fees for preparation of the motion should
compensate for these costs.
          The Court awards sanctions pursuant to C.C.P. §2030.290(c) in
the amount of $660.00, calculated as follows:
(1.5 hours to prepare
instant motion x $400.00) + $60.00 filing fee = $660.00

          On June 12, 2024, Plaintiff served RFA on Ben.  (Decl. of Brault ¶3, Exh. 1.)  Ben’s responses were due on July 17, 2024,
however no responses were served and Ben did not request an extension to
respond to the RFA.  (Decl. of Brault ¶5.)  On July 23 and 26, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel
sent emails to Ben’s counsel asking for responses to the RFA.  (Decl. of Brault ¶6, Exhs. 2, 3.)  Ben’s counsel did not respond to Plaintiff’s
counsel’s emails.  (Decl. of Brault ¶6.)  As of the date of Plaintiff’s motion,
Plaintiff did not receive a response from Ben to the RFA.  (Decl. of Brault ¶6.)  Plaintiff now moves to deem admitted the RFA.  
          Plaintiff’s motion to deem the truth of the matters
specified in its RFA to Ben and the genuineness of all documents specified
therein is granted pursuant to C.C.P. §2033.420(a).
Plaintiff requests monetary
sanctions totaling $1,860.00 against Ben and/or his
counsel.  Since the instant motion is
unopposed, the Court declines to grant sanctions for anticipated fees for reviewing
the opposition and preparing a reply.  Further, since the instant motion is substantially
similar in content to the motion to compel FROG, the Court declines to grant
additional fees for Plaintiff’s counsel’s appearance at the hearing because
fees for preparation of the motion should compensate for these costs.
          The Court awards sanctions pursuant to C.C.P. §2033.280(c) in
the amount of $660.00, calculated as follows:
(1.5 hours to prepare
instant motion x $400.00) + $60.00 filing fee = $660.00

Ben and his attorney, jointly and severally, within 20 days of this order.
Moving Party is to give
notice of this ruling. 
 

4.     Motion to
Compel Deposition- Karen
Meet and Confer
A motion to compel a deposition must be accompanied by a
declaration stating facts showing “a reasonable and good faith attempt at an
informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.”  (C.C.P. §§2016.040, 2025.480(b).)
Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration indicates he attempted to meet
and confer with Karen’s counsel on July 17, 2024.  (See Decl. of Brault ¶13.)  Plaintiff’s counsel declares he spoke on the
phone with Karen’s counsel on July 17, 2024, wherein he asked for available
dates for Karen’s deposition and Karen’s counsel did not provide Plaintiff’s
counsel with any dates.  (Decl. of Brault
¶13.)  Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration
substantially complies with the requirements of C.C.P. §2016.040.  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion is proper.
 
Background
On May 9, 2024, Plaintiff noticed
Karen’s deposition for May 22, 2024. 
(Decl. of Brault ¶4, Exh. 2.)  The notice was served on May 9, 2024.  (Decl. of Brault ¶4, Exh. 2.) 
Plaintiff did not receive oppositions to the deposition notice.  (Decl. of Brault ¶8.)
Plaintiff’s counsel did not receive any
e-mails, letters, telephone calls or other correspondence from Karen’s counsel
from May 8, 2024, until receiving Karen’s Motion to Quash on May 21, 2024.  (Decl. of Brault ¶9.)  Plaintiff’s counsel did not see the e-mail with
the attached motion to quash until the morning of May 22, 2024, the day of the
deposition.  (Decl. of Brault ¶9.)  Plaintiff’s counsel was not able to cancel
the Court Reporter for the May 22, 2024, deposition without incurring a charge,
and Plaintiff incurred a charge for the court reporter’s non-appearance fee in
the amount of $775.00, which has been paid. 
(Decl. of Brault ¶10,
Exh. 6.)
Karen’s Motion to Quash was to be heard
on July 16, 2024.  (Decl. of Brault ¶11.)  In the afternoon of July 15, 2024, this Court
posted its tentative ruling denying the motion and ordering sanctions against
Karen in the sum of $2,1750.00.  (Decl.
of Brault ¶11.)  Thereafter, Karen’s counsel filed a notice
taking the motion off calendar.  (Decl.
of Brault ¶11.)
Plaintiff filed the instant motion on July
18, 2024.  As of the date of this hearing
no opposition has been filed.
 
          Discussion
C.C.P. §2025.280(a) provides, in part,
“[t]he service of deposition notice under Section 2025.240 is effective to
require any deponent who is a party to the action . . . to attend and to
testify, as well as to produce any document or tangible thing for inspection
and copying.”  (C.C.P. §2025.280(a).)
C.C.P. §2025.450 states, in pertinent
part, as follows:
(a) If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action . . .
, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to
appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any
document, . . . described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice
may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and
the production for inspection of any document, . . .  described in the deposition notice.
 
(1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing good cause
justifying the production for inspection of any document . . . described in the
deposition notice.
 
(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration
under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition
and produce the documents . . . described in the deposition notice, by a
declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire
about the nonappearance.
 
(C.C.P. §2025.450.)
          The
Court denied Plaintiff’s motion pursuant to C.C.P. §2025.450.  Plaintiff has not noticed a deposition,
despite attempts to confer with Karen’s counsel regarding a new deposition
date.  In order to properly move for a
motion to compel deposition, Plaintiff must now unilaterally set and notice
Karen’s deposition, due to the fact that the originally scheduled deposition
was stayed by Karen’s motion to quash deposition and this Court’s ruling on the
motion.  (C.C.P §2025.410(c).)
          Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s motion is denied.
 
Sanctions
In light of the Court’s ruling on the
instant motion, the Court declines to award sanctions.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s unopposed motion to
compel Karen’s deposition is denied.  
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions
against Karen is denied.
Moving Party to give notice.
