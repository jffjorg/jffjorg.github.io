 Hearing
  Date:  May 23, 2024




 
Defendant’s
motion to strike costs is DENIED IN PART, GRANTED IN PART. The Court strikes
$37.70 in costs, reducing the total cost award to $2,695.90.
 
On 6/2/2021,
Plaintiff Ashley Ryan (Plaintiff) filed suit against General Motors, LLC
(Defendant), alleging: (1) violation of Civil Code section 1793.2, subdivision
(d); (2) violation of Civil Code section 1793.2, subdivision (b); (3) violation
of Civil Code section 1793.2, subdivision (a)(3); (4) breach of express written
warranty; (5) breach of implied warranty; and (6) fraud by omission.
 
            On
2/23/2024, Defendant moved to strike Plaintiff’s request for $2,733.60 in
costs. 
 
Discussion 
 
            Defendant
argues that Plaintiff is not entitled to recover costs because the Court denied
costs as part of Plaintiff’s attorney fees motion, and because Plaintiff’s counsel
has not shown the merit of Plaintiff’s costs.
 
            As
to the first contention, the Court declined to consider costs as part of the
attorney fees motion, because Plaintiff had not filed a verified memorandum of
costs, and thus the Court had no basis for assessing the properness of those
costs. Verification of the
memorandum of costs by the prevailing party’s attorney establishes a prima
facie showing that the claimed costs are proper.  (Jones v. Dumrichob (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1258, 1267.)  However, the Court’s ruling was a deferment,
rather than a determination that there was no entitlement to costs.
 
            As for the second contention, as
part of GM’s CCP 998 offer, GM agreed to pay “Plaintiff’s attorney’s fees,
expenses and costs that have been reasonably incurred pursuant to California
Civil Code § 1794(d) [that] may be determined by the Court via noticed motion.
For purposes of any such motion, GM will agree that Plaintiff is the prevailing
party.” (Law Decl., Ex. A, at 1:28-2:2.) Accordingly, Plaintiff is entitled to
recover costs. Moreover, there was nothing in the settlement agreement that
dictated a deadline by which to file for costs. 
 
            Accordingly,
the Court finds that Plaintiff is entitled to recover costs. The Court also
finds that all claimed costs are recoverable, with the exception of the notice
of change of address fee for $37.50. As for the other two costs challenged by
Defendant, while this case settled before trial, Plaintiff was entitled to pay
jury fees in the event that this action did proceed to trial, and the provision
of courtesy copies to the Court is reasonable.  

 
            Based
on the foregoing, Defendant’s motion to strike costs is denied in part, granted
in part. The Court strikes $37.70 in costs, reducing the total cost award to $2,695.90.
 
 
 
It is so ordered.
