And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is that Defendant's motion to strike costs is denied in part, granted in part. The court strikes $37.70 in costs, reducing the total cost award to $2,695.90. The plaintiff, Ashley Ryan, filed suit against General Motors, LLC (Defendant) alleging various claims, including violation of Civil Code section 1793.2, breach of express written warranty, and fraud by omission. The defendant moved to strike the plaintiff's request for $2,733.60 in costs. The court finds that the plaintiff is entitled to recover costs, but that the notice of change of address fee for $37.50 is not recoverable. The court also finds that the other two costs claimed by the defendant are reasonable.
