And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion to enforce the settlement agreement between Plaintiff Kaiden De Leon and Defendant EMC Topanga LLC. The settlement agreement provides for a payment of $48,000 to Plaintiff, with $18,000 of that payment being directed to Plaintiff's counsel. Defendant failed to make the payment, and Plaintiff seeks entry of judgment in the amount of $53,000, plus attorney fees. The court finds that the settlement agreement was properly signed by the parties and that Defendant's breach of the agreement is sufficient to warrant entry of judgment. The court will enter a judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the total amount of $49,845, which includes the settlement balance and attorney fees.
