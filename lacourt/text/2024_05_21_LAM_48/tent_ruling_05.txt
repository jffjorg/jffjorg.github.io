On
March 14, 2024, Plaintiff William Hoyman sent Request for Production of
Documents (Set One) and Form Interrogatories – General (Set One) to Defendant
Michael E. Plotkin.  Defendant did not provide
any responses.
On
April 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed two motions to compel Defendant’s responses.  Plaintiff also requested sanctions.
Where
a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the Court may make
an order compelling responses.  (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300; Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)   A party that fails to serve timely responses
waives any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection
of attorney work product.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300, subd. (a).) 

Defendant
did not serve responses to Plaintiff’s discovery and filed no oppositions to these
motions.  Accordingly, the motions to compel
are GRANTED.
Defendant
is ORDERED to serve verified responses, without objections, to Plaintiff’s Request
for Production of Documents (Set One) and Form Interrogatories – General (Set
One) within 30 days of this order.
Each
motion requests sanctions of $2,380.00, calculated as counsel spending “a total
of 4 hours to draft this motion, argue this motion in court, and draft a reply
to Plaintiff’s Opposition” at his hourly rate of $595.  (DeClercq Decl. ¶ 4.)  The Court will not award fees for drafting
replies to these unopposed motions.  The
Court finds that a reasonable sanction for each motion is $1,785.00.
Defendant
is ORDERED to pay a total sanction of $3,570.00 to Plaintiff within 30 days.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
