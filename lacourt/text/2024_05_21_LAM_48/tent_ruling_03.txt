  CASE NO.: 23STCV21208
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO STRIKE
  ANSWER; SETTING OSC
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
May 21, 2024



 
On
September 1, 2023, Plaintiff Cesar Cotto filed this action against Defendant Tacos
Los Guichos.  On October 12, 2024, Defendant
filed an answer in the form of a general denial.  On October 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion
to strike Defendant’s answer.
The
court may, upon a motion or at any time in its discretion: (1) strike out any irrelevant,
false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike out all or any
part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of California,
a court rule, or an order of the court.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 436, subds. (a)-(b).)
Defendant’s
answer was filed by Tacos Los Guichos “in pro per.”  There is no signature on the line for “Signature
of Defendant or Attorney.”  Instead, “Tacos
Los Guichos” is handwritten.
“[A]
corporation cannot represent itself in a court of record either in propria persona
or through an officer or agent who is not an attorney.”  (Caressa Camille, Inc. v. Alcoholic Beverage
Control Appeals Bd. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.)  Because the answer purports to be signed by Tacos
Los Guichos “in pro per,” it is not drawn or filed in conformity with the law.
The
motion to strike is GRANTED.  The Court orders
the General Denial filed on October 12, 2023 stricken.
The
Court will grant Defendant additional time, until July 22, 2024, to obtain counsel
and file a responsive pleading.  An Order
to Show Cause Re: Entry of Default is scheduled for July 22, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in
Department 48 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
Defendant
must retain counsel and file and serve a responsive pleading by that date or the
Court will place Defendant in default.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
