And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motions to compel the defendant's responses to the requests for production of documents and form interrogatories. The defendant failed to respond to the requests, and the court finds that the defendant waived any objections to the requests. The court orders the defendant to serve verified responses to the requests within 30 days. The court also awards sanctions to the plaintiff in the amount of $3,570.00, which is calculated as the cost of counsel's time in drafting and arguing the motions.
