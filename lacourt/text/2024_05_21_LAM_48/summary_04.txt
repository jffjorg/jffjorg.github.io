And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the unopposed motions to set aside the defaults entered against the individual Defendants, Marvin Johnson, Lori Gay, Jesse Ibarra, and Angela Heyward. The defaults were entered on November 13, 2023, and the Defendants moved to set them aside. The Court finds that the defaults were the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, and therefore grants the motions. The Court vacates the defaults and orders the Defendants to file and serve their answers within 10 days.
