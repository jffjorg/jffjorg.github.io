[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR ENTRY
  OF JUDGMENT
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
May 21, 2024



 
On February 15, 2024, Plaintiff Kaiden De Leon and Defendant
EMC Topanga LLC filed a stipulation to dismiss this action pursuant to a settlement,
with the Court retaining jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6
for enforcement of the settlement.
On March 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion
to enforce the settlement and to enter judgment.  Plaintiff’s request for judicial notice is denied
as unnecessary because the filings are already part of this case’s record.

Courts
may enter judgments pursuant to written settlements signed by the parties.  (Elyaoudayan v. Hoffman (2003) 104 Cal.App.4th
1421, 1428; Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6.)  Strict
compliance with the statutory requirements is necessary before a court can enforce
a settlement agreement.  (Sully-Miller
Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th
30, 37.)  The party seeking to enforce a settlement
“must first establish the agreement at issue was set forth ‘in a writing signed
by the parties’ (§ 664.6) or was made orally before the court.  [Citation.]” 
(Harris v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 299, 304.)
Plaintiff
and Defendant signed a settlement agreement on February 2 and 7, 2024.  (Holzman Decl. ¶ 2.)  Defendant agreed to pay Plaintiff a total of $66,000.00,
with $18,000.00 of that payment being directed to Plaintiff’s counsel from the arbitration
retainer reimbursement provided by JAMS, leaving a settlement balance of $48,000.00.  (Holzman Decl., Ex. A [“Settlement Agreement”],
¶ 2.)  Plaintiff’s counsel did receive the
$18,000.00 reimbursement from JAMS.  (Holzman
Decl. ¶ 5.)  Defendant’s payment was due within
10 days after Defendant received a signed copy of the Settlement Agreement and Form
W9.  (Settlement Agreement ¶ 2; see Holzman
Decl. ¶¶ 3-4 & Exs. B-C.)  To date, Defendant
has not made any settlement payment.  (Holzman
Decl. ¶ 5.)
Plaintiff
seeks entry of judgment in the amount of $53,000.00 plus attorney fees.  (Holzman Decl. ¶ 5; see Settlement Agreement ¶
11 [attorney fees provision].)  This is the
sum of the $48,000.00 balance owed plus a $5,000.00 penalty due to Defendant’s breach.
The
Settlement Agreement provides that “in the event Employer fails to make the Settlement
Payment within the time specified in this Agreement, Employer shall pay to Employee
an additional $5,000 in addition to all outstanding sums under this Agreement.”  (Settlement Agreement ¶ 2.)  “‘“[A]n amount disproportionate to the anticipated
damages is termed a ‘penalty.’  A contractual
provision imposing a ‘penalty’ is ineffective, and the wronged party can collect
only the actual damages sustained.”’  [Citation.]”  (McGuire v. More-Gas Investments, LLC (2013)
220 Cal.App.4th 512, 522.)  Accordingly, this
provision is unenforceable, and Plaintiff cannot collect an additional $5,000.00
penalty for Defendant’s breach.
Plaintiff
requests $1,845.00 in attorney fees for this motion.  (Motion at p. 4; Barari Decl. ¶ 4.)  This represents three hours spent on drafting
the motion at counsel’s rate of $595, plus a $60.00 filing fee.  (See Barari Decl. ¶¶ 3-4.)  The Court will not award additional fees for “reviewing
Defendant’s Opposition to the motion(s), [and] drafting a Reply brief if needed”
because the motion is unopposed.  (Barari
Decl. ¶ 4.)
The
unopposed motion to enforce settlement is GRANTED.  The Court will enter a judgment in favor of Plaintiff
and against Defendant in the total amount of $49,845.00 ($48,000.00 balance plus
$1,845.00 attorney fees). 
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
