The judge tentatively rules that the defendant's answer to the lawsuit is invalid because it was not signed by an attorney. The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to strike the defendant's answer. The defendant is given additional time, until July 22, 2024, to obtain counsel and file a responsive pleading. If the defendant fails to do so, the court will place the defendant in default.
