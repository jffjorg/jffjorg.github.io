On
January 26, 2024, Defendant Constance Wildasinn served Requests For Production of
Documents, Special Interrogatories, Form Interrogatories, and Requests for Admissions
on Plaintiff Casamigo Capital LLC.  Plaintiff
did not provide timely responses, and Defendant agreed to extend the deadline to
March 25, 2024.  Plaintiff still did not serve
responses.
On
April 3, 2024, Defendant filed four motions to compel Plaintiff’s responses and
to deem the RFAs admitted.  Defendant also
requested sanctions.
Where
a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the Court may make
an order compelling responses.  (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300; Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)   A party that fails to serve timely responses
waives any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection
of attorney work product.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300, subd. (a).) 

When
a party fails to timely respond to a request for admission, the propounding party
may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any
matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)  The party who failed to respond waives any objections
to the demand, unless the court grants them relief from the waiver, upon a showing
that the party (1) has subsequently served a substantially compliant response, and
(2) that the party’s failure to respond was the result of mistake, inadvertence,
or excusable neglect.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subds. (a)(1)-(2).)  The court shall
grant a motion to deem admitted requests for admissions, “unless it finds that the
party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the
hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is
in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
Plaintiff
did not serve responses to Defendant’s discovery and filed no oppositions to these
motions.  Accordingly, the motions to compel
are GRANTED.
Plaintiff
is ORDERED to serve verified responses, without objections, to Defendant’s Requests
For Production of Documents, Special Interrogatories, and Form Interrogatories within
30 days of this order.
The
motion to deem RFAs admitted is also GRANTED. 
Defendant’s Request for Admission, Set One is deemed admitted by Plaintiff.
Each
motion requests sanctions of $937.50.  Plaintiff’s
counsel is ORDERED to pay a total sanction of $3,750.00 to Defendant within 30 days.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
