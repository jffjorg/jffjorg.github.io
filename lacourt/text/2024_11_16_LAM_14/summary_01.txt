And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a demurrer filed by General Motors, LLC (Defendant) to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by Nancy Beltran (Plaintiff). The FAC alleges that the Defendant violated the Song-Beverly Act and the Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA) by making misrepresentations about the quality and performance of a new motor vehicle purchased by the Plaintiff.

The judge has overruled the demurrer as to the first and second causes of action for breach of implied and express warranties, finding that the FAC adequately pleads these claims. The judge has also denied the Defendant's motion to strike punitive damages, finding that the FAC sufficiently supports a demand for punitive damages based on fraud.

The judge notes that the FAC does not state that the vehicle was used, but rather alleges that it was a new motor vehicle under the Song-Beverly Act. The judge also finds that the FAC adequately pleads a cause of action for violation of the CLRA based on fraud, despite the Defendant's argument that the FAC fails to state what misrepresentations were made.

The case will proceed to a court hearing on November 16, 2024, where the parties will present their arguments and evidence to the court.
