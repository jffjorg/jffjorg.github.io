The court has ruled on several motions filed by Bahamon, including a motion to compel the defendants to respond to discovery requests and to take depositions.

The court has granted Bahamon's motion to compel the deposition of Bill Papariella, finding that Papariella failed to proceed with Bahamon's properly noticed deposition. The court has denied Bahamon's motion to compel the deposition of Karin Saidiner, finding that Saidiner is no longer employed by the defendants.

The court has awarded defendants sanctions in the amount of $1,260 for four hours of attorney time at a rate of $300 per hour and a $60 filing fee. The court has also awarded Bahamon sanctions in the same amount as to the motion to compel the deposition of Bill Papariella.
