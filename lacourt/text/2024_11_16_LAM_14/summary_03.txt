And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for an order approving the transfer of structured settlement payment rights filed by CBC Settlement Funding, LLC, the petitioner. The denial is without prejudice, meaning the petition can be refiled with additional information. The judge found that the petition did not comply with Insurance Code § 10139.5 because it lacked evidence supporting the factors enumerated in the statute, which the court must consider when determining whether a transfer is in the best interest of the payee. The judge also noted that portions of the exhibits submitted with the petition were improperly redacted and advised the petitioner to file a motion to seal and lodge unredacted copies of the documents with the court if necessary.
