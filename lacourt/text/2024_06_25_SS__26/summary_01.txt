```

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Samara Weiner's motion to amend the complaint to substitute the Estate of Michael Koomer as defendant. The motion is brought without any legal authority or supporting evidence, as required by the California Rules of Court. The Plaintiff's failure to provide a memorandum as required by the Rule is considered an admission that the request is without merit and cause for its denial. Furthermore, the Plaintiff has already filed a First Amended Complaint that names Michael C. Argan, as Trustee of the Michael D. Koomer Revocable Trust, and does not name Defendant Michael Koomer. Therefore, the motion is denied.
