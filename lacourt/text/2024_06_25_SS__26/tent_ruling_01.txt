On July 26, 2023, Plaintiff added Art Koomer (“Defendant  Art Koomer”) and Michael Koomer (“Defendant Michael Koomer”) to the Complaint  as doe defendants.   On December 18,  2023, the Court granted Defendants Century Property and Gerhard’s Motion for  Judgment on the Pleadings with respect to the Complaint with leave to amend.  (Minute Order, 12/18/23.) On February 5, 2024, the Court granted the same  Defendants’ ex parte application and dismissed Plaintiff’s Complaint against  them with prejudice. (Minute Order, 02/05/24.)

Rules of Court, Rule 3.1113(b).) Indeed, Plaintiff’s failure to provide a  memorandum as required by the Rule is an “admission that the [request] is  without merit and cause for its denial.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1113(a),  (b); In re Marriage of Falcone & Fyke (2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 964,  976.)
