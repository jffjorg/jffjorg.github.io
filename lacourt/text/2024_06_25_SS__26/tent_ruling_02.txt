ANALYSIS:
 
On October 28, 2022, Plaintiff Qualitas
Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) initiated this interpleader
action against Defendants Julli A. Conde (“Defendant
Conde”) and Richard M. Lester, a law corporation (“Defendant Lester”).
Defendant Lester answered on December 9, 2022. The Court entered default
against Defendant Conde on April 21, 2023. 

 
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Deposit
Funds on February 8, 2024. The Motion came for hearing
on April 30, 2024 and was continued to allow Plaintiff to file a supplemental
declaration. (Minute Order, 04/30/24.) Plaintiff filed a supplemental
declaration on May 2, 2024. To date, no opposition to the Motion has been
filed. 
 
Discussion
 
The Complaint
alleges that this action arises from a dispute over a settlement in a personal
injury action. (Compl., ¶¶2-6.) Defendant Lester represented Defendant Conde in
the underlying action and asserts a $4,000.00 attorney’s fees lien on the
$10,000.00 settlement. (Ibid.) Plaintiff, Defendant Conde’s insurer
concerning the motor vehicle accident that gave rise to the personal injury
settlement, allegedly cannot resolve the dispute over the insurance money. (Id.
at ¶12.) Plaintiff alleges no interest in the insurance money and upon its
deposit seeks to be discharged from liability in this action. (Id. at
¶¶13-16.) Plaintiff also requests an order that
it can recover its reasonable costs and attorney’s fees. (Id. at
¶15.) 
 
Interpleader is a procedure whereby a person holding money
or personal property to which conflicting claims are being made by others, or
may be made, can join the adverse claimants and force them to litigate their
claims among themselves. (Code Civ. Proc., § 386, subd. (b).) Hancock Oil
Co. v. Hopkins (1944) 24 Cal.2d 497, 508 (i.e., an escrow-holder who
receives conflicting demands from the parties to the escrow regarding the funds
or documents he or she holds); City of Morgan Hill v. Brown (1999) 71
Cal.App.4th 1114, 1122.)
 
Once the stakeholder’s right to interplead is established
and he or she deposits the money or personal property in court, he or she may
be discharged from liability to any of the claimants. This enables the
stakeholder to avoid multiplicity of actions, and the risk of inconsistent
results if each of the claimants were to sue him or her separately. (Cantu
v. Resolution Trust Corp. (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 857, 874; City of Morgan
Hill, supra, 71 Cal.App.4th at 1122.)
 
“An interpleader action is traditionally viewed as two
suits: one between the stakeholder and the claimants to determine the
stakeholder's right to interplead, and the other among the claimants to
determine who shall receive the funds interpleaded ... As against the
stakeholder, claimants may raise only matters which go to whether the suit is
properly one for interpleader; i.e., whether the elements of an interpleader
action are present.” (State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. Pietak (2001) 90
Cal.App.4th 600, 612.)
 
The stakeholder may seek reimbursement for its costs and
reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred.  
(UAP-Columbus JV 326132 v. Nesbitt (1991) 234
Cal.App.3d 1028, 1036.) The court may order payment thereof out of the funds
deposited by the stakeholder. (Ibid.) Ultimately, such payment may be
charged to one or more of the adverse claimants in the final judgment. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 386.6.) Finally, the Court may issue an “order restraining all
parties to the action from instituting or further prosecuting any other
proceeding in any court in this state affecting the rights and obligations as
between the parties to the interpleader until further order of the court.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 386, subd. (f).) 
 
Plaintiff’s request for an order depositing the interpleader
funds and to be discharged from liability on the Complaint in interpleader is
proper. Both Defendants have been served and have either answered or are in
default. Substantively, Plaintiff cannot determine the validity of the
conflicting demands that have been made and has no interest in the funds.
(Motion, Heath Decl., ¶3; Hartman Decl., ¶4.) Upon deposit of the funds to the
court, Plaintiff may be discharged from further liability. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
386, 386.5.) Furthermore, Plaintiff is entitled to recover the fees and costs
expended bringing this interpleader action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 386.6, subd.
(a).) 
 
Plaintiff seeks an award of attorney’s fees in the amount of
$9,422.50 based on 36.9 hours of attorney time. (Motion, Supp. Yuen Decl.,
¶¶6-7.) 9.3 hours were billed by a paralegal at $125.00 per hour and the
remaining time was billed at $300.00 per hour. (Ibid.) The hourly rate
billed for the attorney work was reasonable in light of the prevailing rate for
limited jurisdiction work in the area. However, the amount of time spent was
not reasonable. Although the action was filed in October 2022, nothing except a
request for entry of default was filed by Plaintiff until the instant Motion in
March 2024. Plaintiff also applied ex parte to continue the trial date, which
was set for the following month. Had the instant Motion been filed earlier, no
ex parte application would have been required. Nor was it necessary to have two
attorneys and a paralegal work on a straightforward interpleader action. A
single attorney and paralegal would have sufficed. The attorney hours,
therefore, are reduced by 13.8 hours in the amount of $4,140.00. Plaintiff is
awarded fees of $5,282.50. 
 
Finally, Plaintiff’s request for an offset of the $10,000.00
from any judgment awarded to Defendants is denied. 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Qualitas Insurance Company’s Motion to Deposit by
Stakeholder is GRANTED. PLAINTIFF IS TO
DEPOSIT FUNDS OF $4,717.50 WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THIS ORDER AND IS AWARDED
ATTORNEY’S FEES OF $5,282.50.
