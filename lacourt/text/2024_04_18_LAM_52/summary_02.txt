And here is the English-text summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings by defendants Bruce R. Cook and William E. Devin, III, against plaintiffs Perry Lazar and Plone Trust. The defendants argue that all causes of action against them are untimely and that judgment should be granted. The plaintiffs rely on the delayed discovery rule, alleging that they did not discover defects in their title to the subject property until 2019. The court has denied the defendants' motion, finding that a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that the defendants did not put the plaintiffs on inquiry notice of their claims. The court has also granted requests for judicial notice of six exhibits.
