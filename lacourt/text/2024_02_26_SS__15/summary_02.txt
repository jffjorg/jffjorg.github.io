And here is a summary of the text in English:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses 27 motions in limine filed by the defendants, which seek to exclude various evidence and arguments from the trial. The motions are denied or granted in part without prejudice to objections at trial. The evidence at issue includes government regulations, expert opinions, and documents from other lawsuits. The judge rules that some evidence is irrelevant, prejudicial, or unduly time-consuming, while other evidence may be relevant to notice or knowledge. The judge also grants a motion to bifurcate punitive damages. The ruling is subject to change based on further submissions and argument from the parties.
