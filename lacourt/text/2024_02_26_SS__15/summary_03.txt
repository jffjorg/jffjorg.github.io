And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motions in limine filed by the parties and has made a tentative ruling. The motions are:

* Plaintiffs' MIL No. 1: The motion to exclude evidence of other defendants who are not at trial and the contents of the complaint is denied in part and granted in part. The complaint may contain judicial admissions of fact.
* Plaintiffs' MIL No. 2: The motion to exclude expert James Dahlgren's religious practices and beliefs, his prior association with BWell Clinic, and prior court orders about him is granted.
* Plaintiffs' MIL No. 3: The motion to preclude mention of exposure to products eliminated by summary judgment orders is denied.
* Defendants' MIL No. 1: The motion to exclude evidence and argument about a post-sale failure to warn is denied.
* Defendants' MIL No. 2: The motion to exclude voir dire questions suggesting a specific damages amount is denied.

The judge has also noted that the motions are too vague and do not identify specific orders or products. Finally, the judge has stated that the expert's religious practices and beliefs are irrelevant, and his prior association with BWell Clinic is not relevant.
