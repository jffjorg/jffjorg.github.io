Discussion
 
Compensatory
damages
 
Plaintiff requests
damages in the total amount of $115,900, which represents the repayment balance
Defendant owes on the $136,500 loan he took out, plus fees. (O’Connell Decl., ¶¶
9 & 11, Exhs. A & B.) 
 
Interest
 
            As to the
interest, Plaintiff requests $7,366.00. The amount was calculated by applying
the statutory rate of 10% per annum on the outstanding balance of $115,900.00
for a period of 232 days, from July 23, 2023 to March 11, 2024. (O’Connell
Decl., ¶ 13.) Interest started to accrue on July 23, 2023 because Defendant did
not make his July 18, 2023 payment, and pursuant to paragraph 7.1 of the
Agreement, the borrower is considered to be in default when a payment amount
has become due but remains unpaid for 5 days. (O’Connell Decl., ¶ 10; Exh. A.)
This results in a figure of $7,366.79. Plaintiff requests $7,366.00. The Court
awards this amount. 
            
Attorney fees
 
            Counsel requests
$3,049.00 in fees “pursuant to the court’s default fee schedule.” (O’Connell
Decl., ¶ 14.) This amount complies with Local Rule 3.214 and the amount is
awarded. 
 
Costs
 
            Plaintiff also requests $511.00 in
costs, representing $435.00 in filing fees, and $76.00 in service fees. These
amounts are proper under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1033.5, subdivisions
(a)(1) and (a)(4). Accordingly, the Court grants these amounts.
 
Conclusion
 
            Plaintiff Can Capital, Inc. is
awarded default Judgment in the total amount of $126,826.00 against Defendant Richard
Raya.
