And here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the defendants' motion to continue the trial to January 13, 2025. The defendants' motion was filed on March 1, 2024, and the court finds good cause to continue the trial due to the need for 30 witness depositions and the defendants' counsel's scheduling conflicts. The court also grants the defendants' request to continue the final status conference to January 2, 2025.
