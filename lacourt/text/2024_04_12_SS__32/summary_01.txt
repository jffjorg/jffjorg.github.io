Here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies Defendant's motion for terminating sanctions against Plaintiff. The motion was brought because Plaintiff failed to comply with discovery orders. The Court finds that Plaintiff's failure to serve verified responses was not willful, but rather due to a mistake by Plaintiff's counsel. However, the Court does impose monetary sanctions in the amount of $412.50 against Plaintiff and Plaintiff's counsel, jointly and severally. The Court also orders Defendant to provide notice of the ruling and file a proof of service of such.
