```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has granted Defendant Palisades Village Center Associates, LLC's motion for summary judgment. The Defendant has met its burden of showing that the Privette doctrine applies and that no recognized exceptions are applicable. The evidence shows that Defendant contracted with Ayala Development to manage and oversee the renovation project, and that Ayala later retained F&M Building Construction, Inc. (FMBC) for work. Plaintiff was hired by FMBC to perform work on the site. Since Plaintiff has not filed an opposition, he fails to meet his burden of showing a triable issue of fact. Therefore, the motion for summary judgment is granted.
