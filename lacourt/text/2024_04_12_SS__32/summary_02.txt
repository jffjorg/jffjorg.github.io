```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's ex parte application for relief from jury waiver. The plaintiff failed to timely demand a jury trial and failed to pay the required jury fees. The defendant has prepared for a bench trial and would be prejudiced if forced to switch to a jury trial at this late stage. The court finds that the defendant will suffer prejudice if relief from waiver is granted. The plaintiff's request is untimely, and the court has denied the application. The plaintiff is ordered to provide notice of the court's ruling and file proof of service of such notice.
