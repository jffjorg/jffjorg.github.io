TENTATIVE
RULING
 



DEPT:


32




HEARING DATE:


April
  12, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


20STCV14882




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  for Terminating Sanctions   




MOVING PARTY:


Defendant Duc Hoang Duong, M.D. 




OPPOSING PARTY:


Plaintiff
  Miguel de la Rosa 



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
Defendant Duc Hoang Duong, M.D. (Defendant) moves for
terminating sanctions against Plaintiff Miguel de la Rosa (Plaintiff) for failure to comply
with the Court’s December 14, 2023 and December 15, 2023 discovery orders.
Defendant also moves for monetary sanctions. Plaintiff opposes and Defendant
replies. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
“To
the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method
or any other provision of this title, the court, after notice to any affected
party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may
impose…sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the
discovery process.” (Code Civ. Proc. section 2023.030.) The court may impose a
terminating sanction for misuse of the discovery process by any of the
following: “(1) An order striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings
of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process; (2) An order
staying further proceedings by that party until an order for discovery is
obeyed; (3) An order dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that
party; (4) An order rendering a judgment by default against that party.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2023.030(d).)  Failing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery, or
disobeying
a court order to provide discovery, constitutes a
misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d), (g).)

 
“The trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse
‘after considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the
party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the
propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the
discovery.’” (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th
377, 390, quoting Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal. App. 4th 1225,
1246.)   
 
“Generally, ‘[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be
made lightly.  But where a violation is
willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the
trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.’” (Los
Defensores, supra, 223 Cal. App. 4th at p. 390 [citation omitted].)    
 
“Under this standard, trial courts have properly imposed terminating
sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed one or more discovery orders.”
(Los Defensores, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390 citing Lang, supra, 77
Cal.App.4th at pp. 1244-1246 [discussing cases]; see, e.g., Collisson &
Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622 [terminating
sanctions imposed (by striking the defendant’s Answer and subsequently granting
default judgment) after defendants failed to comply with one court order to
produce discovery]; Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991) 231
Cal.App.3d 481, 491, disapproved on other grounds in Garcia v. McCutchen
(1997) 16 Cal.4th 469, 478, n. 4 [terminating sanctions imposed against the
plaintiff for failing to comply with a discovery order and for violating
various discovery statutes].)  
 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendant served discovery on Plaintiff on April 13, 2023. (Ashtari
Decl. ¶ 2.) On December 14, 2023 and December 15, 2023, the Court granted
Defendant’s unopposed motions to compel. Plaintiff was ordered to provide
verified responses, without objections, to Form Interrogatories, Special
Interrogatories, and Request for Production of Documents, Set One within 30
days. (See Min. Order, 12/14/23, 12/15/23.) Defendant served notice of the orders
electronically to Plaintiff’s counsel on December 18, 2023. 
 
On March 18, 2024, Defendant filed the instant motion asserting that
he had not received responses. 
 
Plaintiff’s opposition asserts that the failure to serve discovery
responses was not willful and that Defendant’s notice of the orders were unknowingly
directed to a spam folder. (Opp., 6.; Circcarelli Decl. ¶¶ 12–13.) While
Plaintiff’s counsel concedes counsel should have investigated the outcome of
the motions to compel, but states that the motions “fell completely off my
radar” due to the holiday season. (Circcarelli Decl. ¶ 14.)  Plaintiff also asserts that counsel has
provided verified responses, without objections, to Defendant’s discovery, upon
learning of the Court’s order through this motion. (Id. ¶ 12, 16, Exh.
A.) 
 
In reply, Defendant concedes that Plaintiff has served verified
responses. (Reply, 2.) Therefore, terminating sanctions are not appropriate at
this stage. 
 
However, Plaintiff offers no explanation for why discovery responses
were not served, knowing that motions to compel were on the Court’s calendar
and, more significantly, knowing that discovery was still outstanding. Although
Plaintiff’s counsel offers the excuse of the holiday season for not following
up regarding the outcome of the motions, counsel does not explain why discovery
responses were not served. Accordingly, monetary sanctions are appropriate.
However, the amount requested is excessive given the type of motion. The Court
awards sanctions in the amount of $412.50 (1.5 hours of attorney time plus the
filing fee).
 
CONCLUSION
 
Therefore, Defendant’s motion for terminating sanctions is DENIED. 
 
Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel, jointly and severally, shall pay
monetary sanctions in the amount of $412.50 to counsel for Defendant.
 
Defendant shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
