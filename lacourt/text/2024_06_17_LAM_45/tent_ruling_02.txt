Background
            Weather
Group, LLC and Entertainment Studios Networks, Inc. (collectively, Plaintiffs) filed
a Complaint on May 4, 2023 against McDonald’s USA, LLC, (Defendant) alleging a
single cause of action for Fraud — False Promise (Civ. Code § 1711).
            The
Complaint alleges the following: Prominent American corporations promised to
take an active role in remedying racial injustice after George Floyd’s murder
ignited nationwide protests. (Complaint, ¶ 1.) Defendant only pledged $1
million despite being one of the largest public corporations in America. (Id.
at ¶ 2.) Plaintiffs are part of a conglomerate of related media companies
(“Allen Media Group” or “AMG), all owned by Byron Allen, an African American entrepreneur.
(Id. at ¶ 4.) AMG is by far the largest African American-owned media
company in the country, with Plaintiffs representing over 90 percent of that
category. (Id. at ¶ 8.) Allen created the Black Owned Media Matters
movement after the George Floyd murder to address racial discrimination and
systemic racism in the media. (Id. at ¶ 5.) 
            AMG
informed Defendant in March 2021 that AMG had been victims of racial discrimination
in contracting in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981. (Id. at ¶ 6.) Plaintiffs
allege that Defendant announced its “Four-Year Plan” in May 2021 to deflect from
these serious allegations. (Id. at ¶ 7.) Plaintiffs further allege that Defendant’s
plan included a commitment to increase its spending with Black Owned Media from
two to five percent by 2024. (Id.) 
            Plaintiffs
allege that in reliance on Defendant’s commitment, Plaintiffs spent
considerable time and effort to put together a proposal for Defendant to
advertise across their portfolio. (Id. at ¶ 9.) Defendant rebuffed
Plaintiffs and proposed to spend only a tiny fraction of its advertising budget
on Plaintiffs’ properties. (Id. at ¶ 10.) Defendant’s allocation left it
well short of its public commitment. (Id.) In 2021 and afterwards,
Defendant was not spending anywhere close to two percent of its national
advertising budget on Black Owned Media under any definition. (Id. at
12.) Plaintiffs then filed suit.
            Now
the motion before the Court is Defendant’s Motion
for Attorney’s Fees (the Motion). Plaintiffs oppose the Motion, Defendant files
a reply.
Discussion 
Legal Standard
            With
respect to attorney fees and costs, unless they are specifically provided for
by statute (e.g., CCP §§ 1032, et seq.), the measure and mode of compensation
of attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement, express or
implied, of the parties. (CCP § 1021.) The prevailing party on a contract,
which specifically provides for attorney fees and costs incurred to enforce the
agreement, is entitled to reasonable attorney fees in addition to other
costs. (Civ. Code § 1717(a); CCP §§ 1032, 1033.5(a)(10)(A).) The
court, upon notice and motion by a party, shall determine the prevailing party
and shall fix, as an element of the costs of suit, the reasonable attorney
fees. (Civ. Code § 1717(a), (b).) Any notice of motion to claim
attorney fees as an element of costs under shall be served and filed before or
at the same time the memorandum of costs is served and filed; if only attorney
fees are claimed as costs, the notice of motion shall be served and filed
within the time specified in CRC 3.1700 for filing a memorandum of
costs. (CRC 3.1702; Gunlock Corp. v. Walk on Water, Inc. (1993) 15
Cal.App.4th 1301, 1303, fn. 1.)
            “It
is well established that the determination of what constitutes reasonable
attorney fees is committed to the discretion of the trial court, whose decision
cannot be reversed in the absence of an abuse of discretion. [Citation.]” (Melnyk v. Robledo (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d
618, 623-624.) The fee setting inquiry in California ordinarily “begins with
the ‘lodestar’ [method], i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended
multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” (Graciano
v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.) “[A]
computation of time spent on a case and the reasonable value of that time is
fundamental to a determination of an appropriate attorneys’ fee award.” (Margolin v. Reg’l Planning Comm’n (1982)
134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004.) The lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on
consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the
fair market value for the legal services provided. (See Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49 [discussing factors
relevant to proper attorneys’ fees award].) 
Analysis
            Defendant
files the instant Motion after prevailing on their anti-SLAPP motion on
February 2, 2024. (See Minute Order dated February 2, 2024.) In Defendant’s
moving papers, they argue they are entitled to attorney’s fees pursuant to Code
Civ. Proc. §425.16(c). Plaintiff does not oppose whether the fees sought were
reasonably incurred in connection with the anti-SLAPP motion. Plaintiff only
opposes the moving papers on the grounds that if the ruling on the anti-SLAPP
motion is reversed upon appeal, the attorney’s fees will be vacated. Upon
reply, Defendant argues the award of fees is immediately enforceable even when
plaintiff has appealed, citing to Carpenter v. Jack in the Box Corp.
(2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 454, 461. The Court agrees and grants the
Motion.
 
Conclusion 
            Accordingly, Defendant McDonald’s
USA, LLC’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees is GRANTED.
            It
is so ordered.
