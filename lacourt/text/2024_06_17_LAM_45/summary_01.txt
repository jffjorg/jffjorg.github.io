Here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted Relator's motion to quash the subpoena issued by the defendants. The judge found that the California Department of Insurance does not have subpoena immunity and that the defendants lack good cause to burden a non-party witness. The judge also ordered an in-camera review of the documents sought by the subpoena to determine if they are covered by the attorney-client privilege or attorney work-product doctrine.
