And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the petition without prejudice and dismissed it. The petition was filed by David Kartch, who sought an order directing the redaction of his personal identifying information from public indexes and databases. Kartch alleged that DAGUT Group Inc. had used his personal address in its corporate registration documents without his consent, and that he suspected potential identity theft.

The court has considered the petition and a renewed motion on multiple occasions, and has found that Kartch has not provided sufficient evidence of unlawful use of his personal identifying information. The court has also noted that DAGUT Group Inc. has not been served with the petition, and that Kartch has not established that any personal identifying information about him has been used.

The court has referred Kartch to the communications from the California Attorney General, which provide advice on ways to protect and monitor potential activity, including contact with credit reporting agencies and potential filings with the California Secretary of State. The court has also noted that Kartch may elect to place a security alert in his credit report, which would notify recipients of his credit report that his identity may have been used without his consent to fraudulently obtain goods or services.
