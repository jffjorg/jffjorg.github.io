```

The Judge's Tentative Ruling is that the motion for summary judgment is DENIED in its entirety. The court finds that there are triable issues of material fact arising from the parties' partnership agreement based on the lack of any evidence of any actual statutory violation under the operative regulation as passed Proposition M and reflected in Los Angeles Municipal Code 104, et seq., California Health and Safety Code section 11379.6, subdivision (a). The court declines to consider the defendants' arguments regarding the alleged illegal operation of a second dispensary under a single license and the alleged illegal extraction operation.
