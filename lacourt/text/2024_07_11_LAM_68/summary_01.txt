```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied Plaintiff Gavrielli Brands, LLC's motion for further sanctions against Defendant Empire Container Freight Station, Inc. The Plaintiff seeks further monetary sanctions due to the Defendant's failure to comply with prior orders imposing $26,000 and $16,000 in sanctions. The court finds that imposing further monetary sanctions would be punitive in nature and would not perpetuate the purpose of discovery. Instead, the court allows the Plaintiff to pursue other remedies for the sought-after payment goal. The court also notes that a sanctions award is an order with the force and effect of a money judgment and can be enforced through execution.
