TENTATIVE
RULING
Plaintiff Shores, LLC (1)
Application for Writ of Attachment as to Defendant Abode LA, LLC, is GRANTED. Plaintiff
seeks a writ as to Defendant in the amount of $793,104.60. Plaintiffs are
ordered to post an undertaking in the amount of $10,000.  
 
 
1.  The Claim:

 
Plaintiff establishes Defendant Abode LA, LLC (“Abode”) executed
the 22 Leases and that each of the 22 Leases provides a monthly rental amount
for each unit. (See Levine Decl., ¶ 4; Hoomissen Decl., ¶ 12, Ex. 10.) The
agreed rent under a lease is evidence of the rental value, or reasonable value
of use. (See, Harris v. Bissell (1921) 54 Cal.App. 307; 12 Witkin,
Summary 11th Real Prop § 771 (2024).)
 
Plaintiff establishes Abode owes $760,104.60 to Plaintiff in
daily rental damages and provides the method by which they obtained that number.
(See Levine Decl., ¶ 13, Ex. 3; See Motion, p. 12:11–18.) Plaintiff establishes
attorney fees and costs at capped by lease agreements at $33,000 ($1500 x 22
units), and Plaintiff’s counsel declares his time billed far surpasses the
$33,000 in recoverable fees. (Levine Decl., ¶ 6; Hoomissen Decl., ¶ 13.)  Plaintiff establishes that the amount of
attachment is readily discernable and over $500. 
 
 
2.  Probable Validity
of the Claim: 
 
Plaintiff
establishes that Abode entered in the lease agreements for the 22 units at
issue. (See Levine Decl., ¶ 4; Van Hoomissen Decl., ¶ 12, Ex. 10.) Plaintiff
establishes Abode took possession of the relevant units and Plaintiff
terminated the month-to-month tenancies on 6-4-23. (Levine Decl., ¶ 11; Van
Hoomissen Decl., ¶¶ 3, 4, Ex. 1, 2.) Plaintiff establishes daily rental damages
at $760,104.60. (Levine Decl., ¶ 13, Ex. 3.) 
 
Abode does not
establish any reasonable defense to attachment in the opposition. Reasonable
rental value can be obtained through the contract itself as demonstrated by
Plaintiff because the contract amount is “reasonable and definite.” (See CIT
Group/Equipment Financing, Inc., supra, 115 Cal.App.4th at p.
541 [“master lease and corresponding lease schedules provided clear formula for
computation of damages: monthly rent multiplied by unexpired term].)  Abode fails to show mitigation defense applies
to Plaintiff’s application for a writ of attachment.  More important, Abode does not submit any
competent or persuasive evidence that supports its claimed defenses failure to
mitigate damages, offset or otherwise. Indeed, in his own declaration, Mr. Weis
fails to show how he has personal knowledge of the facts stated in his declaration
or otherwise show the proper foundation for the admissibility of any of the exhibits
he attaches to his declaration as exhibits A-D.  Regardless, even if the Court were to consider
that evidence, the Court is not persuaded that Plaintiff has failed to meet its
burden to show the probable validity of its claims. (See, Hobbs v. Weiss
(1999) 73 Cal. App.4th 76, 80 (court must “consider the relative merits of the
positions of the respective parties and make a determination of the probable
outcome of the litigation”).  The trial
court is not required to accept as true the sworn testimony of any witness or
undisputed affidavit testimony. It may make contrary findings based on
inferences drawn from other evidence.  See
Bank of America v. Salinas Nissan (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 273.
 
3.  Suit for
Damages.
 
Yes.  
 
4.  Property to
be Attached:  
 
 Plaintiff seeks to attach all Abode property
in California for which there is a method of levy. 
All property within California held by a corporation,
partnership or unincorporated association is subject to attachment if there is
a statutory method of levy for the property (CCP §487.010(a),(b)).  By logical extension, the above requirement applies
to limited liability companies.  See
CCP §481.170 (defining “person” for attachment purposes to include
corporations, partnerships, unincorporated associations and limited liability
companies.)
 
5.  Undertaking:

 
 An undertaking is
required pursuant to CCP §489.210 which provides that, "Before issuance of
a writ of attachment . . ., the plaintiff shall file an undertaking to pay the
defendant any amount the defendant may recover for any wrongful attachment by
the plaintiff in the action."  A
flat amount of undertaking is provided for by statute: $10,000 (CCP
§489.220(a)).  The Court may set a higher
amount pursuant to CCP §489.220(b) if there is an objection to the undertaking.
 
Plaintiffs are ordered to provide an undertaking of $10,000 
 
6.  Claim
of Exemption.  None filed or applicable.
