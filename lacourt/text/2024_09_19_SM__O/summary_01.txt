And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on the demurrer with motion to strike filed by the defendants, 557 Westlake, LLC and Nissim David-Chai. The defendants had argued that the plaintiff, Renovating Specialist, Inc. dba Sivan Windows And Doors, had failed to plead the elements of fraud in the inducement and had failed to plead that the defendants had made knowingly false statements prior to the execution of the contract.

The judge has rejected these arguments, finding that the plaintiff has successfully pleaded all the elements of a cause of action for fraud in the inducement. The judge has also found that the plaintiff has pleaded the requisite intent to take property by false pretenses, which is necessary to plead a cause of action under Penal Code § 496.

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendants' demurrer to the 2nd and 3rd causes of action is overruled, and that the plaintiff's prayer for punitive and treble damages, plus attorneys' fees, is denied. The judge has also denied the defendants' motion to strike the prayer for punitive and treble damages.

The case is set for hearing on September 19, 2024.
