And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the complaint filed by Defendants 1250 North Fairfax Avenue, LLC and Sares Regis Management Company, LP. The Judge has OVERRULED the demurrer, finding that the claims alleged by Plaintiffs Artur Elizarov and Ilya Alekseyeff are sufficient to state a cause of action.

The Judge has determined that the doctrine of res judicata does not apply to the new claims, as they arise from a separate settlement agreement and not from the same underlying landlord-tenant litigation as the prior action. The Judge has also found that the fraud claim is plead specifically and suffices to allege a claim of fraud.

The Judge has noted that the release signed by Plaintiffs in the prior litigation does not bar the new claims, as they arise from the alleged breach of the settlement agreement and not from the same underlying claims. The Judge has also found that the Defendants' argument that the claims are barred by the doctrine of res judicata is without merit.
