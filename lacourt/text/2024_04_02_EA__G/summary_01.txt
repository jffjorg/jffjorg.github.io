Here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the plaintiff, Eric Zhang & Associates LLP, is granted permission to conduct limited non-party discovery to identify the Doe Defendants who allegedly made false and defamatory reviews on Google, Glassdoor, and Indeed. This discovery will assist the plaintiff in obtaining identifying information about the Doe Defendants. The court notes that this case is different from Pearlson v. Does 1 To 646 (1999) because the category of Doe Defendants is limited to individuals who made specific comments, reviews, or posts about the plaintiff on the specified websites.
