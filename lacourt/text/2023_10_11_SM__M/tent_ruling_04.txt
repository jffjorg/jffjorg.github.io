 Case Number:  22SMCV02950    Hearing Date:   October 11, 2023    Dept:  M CASE NAME:           Thanou v. Mahgerefteh
CASE NO.:                22SMCV02950
MOTION:                  Motion
for Trial Preference
HEARING DATE:   10/11/2023

 
Legal
Standard
 
            A party who is 70 years of age or
older, or who reach that age during pendency of the action, may be entitled to
preference if they establish to the court's satisfaction that: 1) he has a
“substantial interest in the action as a whole”; and 2) his health is “such
that preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing the party's interest in the
litigation.” (CCP § 36(a), (c)(2).) In contrast to minor plaintiffs,
trial¿priority is not mandatory and absolute merely because one of the parties
is age 70. The court has discretion to determine the¿extent¿of that party's
interest and find as a matter of fact the risk posed of that party's death or
incapacity if¿trial¿is delayed. (CCP § 36(a).) However, if the factors are
shown, the Court “shall” grant preference.  
 
            A¿trial¿must be set within 120 days
even if opposing parties have not completed discovery or pretrial preparations.
(Swaithes v. Superior Court¿(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 1082, 1086.) Mere
inconvenience to the court or to other litigants is irrelevant. (Rice¿v.¿Superior
Court (1982) 136 Cal.App.3d 81, 89-94; see Polibrid Coatings,
Inc. v. Superior Court (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 920, 923-924 [when brought
into case after over half the time to litigate has passed, party should be
given “at least enough time” to “reasonably complete discovery and bring a
summary judgment motion.”].) Thus, the Court must focus on the moving parties’
burden, rather than striking a balance between the conflicting interests of
opposing litigants.  
 
            A declaration supporting a motion
for CCP section 36(a)¿preference¿“may be signed by the attorney for the party seeking¿preference¿based
upon information and belief¿as to the¿medical diagnosis and prognosis¿of¿any
party.” (CCP § 36.5.) Accordingly, an attorney's declaration can consist
entirely of hearsay and conclusions. (Fox v. Superior Court (2018)
21 Cal.App.5th 529, 534.) 
 
            The
court has the general discretionary power to grant priority to any case upon a
showing of good cause, i.e. “that the interests of justice will be served by
granting this¿preference.” (CCP § 36(e).) A¿trial¿setting may not deprive
defendant of reasonable opportunity for discovery or pretrial preparation in violation
due process of law. (Roe v. Superior Court¿(1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 642,
643;¿Peters v. Superior Court (1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 218,
227.) 
 
Analysis
 
Counsel for plaintiff provides the
following information. Plaintiff Markella Thanou is 93 years old.
(Opia-Enwemuche Decl., ¶¶5-9.) Cedar Sinai Hospital medical records show that
she is currently in ill health, as she suffers numerous illnesses such as
congestive heart failure, HCC, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia
and heart arrhythmia. She also has a pacemaker. She also has suffered from
Aortic valve disorder (Noted 7/11/2022), ascites (Noted 4/15/2022), CHF
exacerbation (Noted 1/2/2015), Heart failure (Noted 8/20/2014), left
ventricular hypertrophy, Palpitations (Noted 8/20/2014) and shortness of breath
(Noted 8/19/2014). She currently has cirrhosis of the liver, due to her heart
failure. She is on various medications for her condition.
 
Plaintiff has substantial interest
in the action, as she is the sole plaintiff in this matter. Further, based on
the above averments, Plaintiff’s condition is such that preference is necessary
to prevent prejudicing her interest in the litigation. Critically, she is already
at an advanced age, with several life-threatening conditions, such as congestive
heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver, cancer of the liver, among other
illnesses. From these facts, the Court concludes that her risk of death or
incapacity during the pendency of this matter is high. Preference is therefore
to avoid the risk of prejudice to Plaintiff. 
 
Accordingly, the motion for
preference is GRANTED.
 
The Court shall advance the
demurrer filed in this action from March 26, 2023, to November 3, 2023, at 9:00
a.m.
 
The Court shall discuss a trial
date within 120 days at the hearing on this matter.
