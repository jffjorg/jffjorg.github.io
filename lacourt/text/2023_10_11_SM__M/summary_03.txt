And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to vacate the arbitration stay and to impose sanctions against the defendants. The defendants failed to pay arbitration fees in a timely manner, which led to a material breach of the arbitration agreement and a waiver of their right to compel arbitration. The judge found that the defendants' delay in paying the fees was not unreasonable and that the plaintiff did not unreasonably delay in bringing this motion. The judge also found that the defendants did not have a due process right to defend themselves in arbitration and that their actions waived their right to do so. The judge ordered the defendants to pay $5,560.00 in sanctions to the plaintiff's counsel within 30 days.
