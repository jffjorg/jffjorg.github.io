Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered a motion for leave to amend the complaint filed by Plaintiff Jonathan Ornstein. The motion is moot, as the plaintiff has already filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) on July 7, 2023. The court also notes that it did not intend to limit the previously-granted leave to amend to only a substitution of the plaintiff, but rather to allow the plaintiff to correct the technical form of the action as a derivative claim, including making any necessary allegations to support the derivative action. The court also notes that defendants have filed a motion to strike and demurrer against the FAC, and any deficiencies with the current FAC may be addressed then.
