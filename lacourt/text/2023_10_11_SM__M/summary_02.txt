And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has tentatively ruled on several issues in this case. First, the judge has sustained the demurrer (a legal objection to the complaint) with leave to amend as to the first and fourth causes of action (breach of CC&Rs and equitable relief), finding that the complaint does not adequately state a breach of contract. Second, the judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to the intentional infliction of emotional distress cause of action, finding that the alleged conduct by the Board members is not extreme or outrageous. Finally, the judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to the conversion cause of action, finding that the tort of conversion applies to personal property, not real property.
