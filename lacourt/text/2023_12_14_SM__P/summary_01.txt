And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's (Johnson) First Amended Complaint against the defendant (Essex Property Trust, Inc.). The plaintiff alleges that Essex failed to maintain the building, allowing dangerous and uninhabitable conditions to exist, including a poisonous methane leak. Essex has filed a demurrer to the plaintiff's fraud claim and a motion to strike the request for punitive damages.

The judge has overruled Essex's demurrer to the fraud claim, finding that the plaintiff adequately alleged fraudulent concealment. The judge notes that the heightened pleading standard does not apply to claims based on nondisclosure, and that the plaintiff alleged that Essex was aware of the methane leak but did not disclose it.

The judge has denied Essex's motion to strike the request for punitive damages, finding that the fraud claim is one of the bases for a punitive damages award, and that the plaintiff adequately alleged fraud by concealment.

The judge has ordered Essex to answer the complaint within 20 days.
