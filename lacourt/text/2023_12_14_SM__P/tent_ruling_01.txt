  Case Number:  21STCV01974    Hearing Date:   December 14, 2023    Dept:  P Tentative Ruling 
Johnson v. Essex
Property Trust, Inc., Case No. 21STCV01974
Hearing Date 12/14/2023
Essex Defendants’
Demurrer to and Motion to Strike Portions of First Amended Complaint

Plaintiff
rented an apartment in a building owned and operated by the Essex defendants.
Plaintiff alleges Essex failed to maintain the building, allowing dangerous and
uninhabitable conditions to exist, including a poisonous methane leak.
Plaintiff alleges she reported these conditions but Essex did not remedy them. The
Essex defendants demur to plaintiff’s cause of action for fraud and move to
strike the request for punitive damages. 
 
Fraud 
The elements of
fraudulent concealment are (1) defendant concealed or suppressed a material
fact, (2) duty to disclose, (3) defendant intentionally concealed the fact with
intent to defraud, (4) plaintiff was unaware of the fact and would not have
acted as she did had she known of the fact, and (5) resulting damage. Mosier
v. S. Cal. Physicians Ins. Exch. (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1022, 1045. The rule
of heightened specificity regarding fraud applies to affirmative
misrepresentation, not claims based on concealment or lack of disclosure. Alfaro
v. Community Housing Improvement System & Planning Assoc., Inc. (2009)
171 Cal.App.4th 1356, 1384. Landlords aware of hidden defects in their property
have an affirmative duty to inform tenants. Shotwell v. Bloom (1943) 60
Cal.App.2d 303, 310(superseded on other grounds Chavez v. City of Los
Angeles (2010) 47 Cal.4th 970, 983). 
 
Essex argues the
fraud claim is not alleged with sufficient particularity. The fraud claim is
not based on an affirmative misrepresentation but on alleged failure to disclose
a material fact, the presence of methane. FAC ¶¶140-144. Under Alfaro, the
heightened pleading standard does not apply to claims based on nondisclosure. Plaintiff
alleges defendants were aware of methane but did not tell her. It would be
illogical to require her to allege “when” or “how” defendants did not tell her.
She alleges they never told her, and she discovered the issue independently in summer
2022. FAC ¶19. That is sufficient. 
 
Likewise Johnson
is not required to name a specific employee who allegedly committed fraud since
this is a claim based on nondisclosure, not affirmative misrepresentation. Johnson
alleges no one working for Essex disclosed the presence of methane. She is not
required to name an employee who hypothetically could have disclosed the
condition. Essex also argues plaintiff has not adequately alleged a duty to
disclose the presence of methane. Johnson alleges Essex owned/controlled the
building and knew about the presence of methane. FAC ¶¶140-141. Under Shotwell,
this created a duty of disclosure to Essex’s tenants. Plaintiff adequately
alleges fraudulent concealment. OVERRULED. Defendants to answer within 20 days.
 
Motion to Strike Punitive
Damages 
Fraud is one of
the bases for a punitive damages award. Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §3294. Johnson adequately
alleged fraud by concealment. The request for punitive damages is proper. DENIED.
