And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to compel the deposition of the plaintiff, Julia Sarabi. The defendant had previously noticed the deposition for February 14, 2024, but the plaintiff objected and did not provide alternative dates. The plaintiff's limited opposition brief did not dispute the facts, and therefore, the Judge has granted the motion. The Judge has also imposed sanctions on the plaintiff in the amount of $260, consisting of 1 hour of defense counsel's time at an hourly rate of $200 and a $60 filing fee, to be paid within 20 days of the date of the order.
