Here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has considered the Plaintiff's motion to amend the complaint and the Defendant's opposition to the motion. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff's motion does not meet its burden of demonstrating why the amendment is necessary, and that the Plaintiff has not provided a thorough analysis supported by instructive authority. The Judge also notes that the Defendant has not explained the work that Test-Rite engages in, and has taken judicial notice of the corporation's Statement of Information.

The Judge is concerned about the privacy implications of producing personnel records and has reviewed the California Public Records Act and relevant case law. The Judge concludes that an employee has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his personnel records, but that this expectation is not automatic and must be weighed against the need for discovery.

The Judge has tentatively ruled that the Plaintiff's motion to amend the complaint will be granted, but only to the extent that the Plaintiff provides a copy of the proposed amendment that shows what allegations will be deleted and what allegations will be added. The Judge also notes that the Plaintiff has agreed to provide medical records and salary information, and that any concerns about privacy with disclosure of this information are moot.

The Judge has set the tentative ruling for hearing and invites the parties to address the issues raised in the ruling.
