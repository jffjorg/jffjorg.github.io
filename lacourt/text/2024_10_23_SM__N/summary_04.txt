And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's first amended complaint is sustained with 30 days' leave to amend. The plaintiff, Creditors Adjustment Bureau, Inc., may only amend its complaint as authorized by the court's order and may not add new parties or causes of action without permission. The judge has denied both parties' requests for sanctions.

The judge's ruling is based on the plaintiff's failure to sufficiently plead the terms of the contracts and debt amounts underlying its breach of contract, open book account, account stated, and reasonable value claims. The plaintiff has not provided copies of the insurance policies or described the terms of the agreements in sufficient detail for the trier of fact to determine the obligations owed by all parties to the agreements.

The judge has cited various California cases to support its ruling, including Harris v. Wachovia Mortgage, FSB, Lewis v. Safeway, Inc., and Aubry v. Tri-City Hosp. Dist. The judge has also noted that the burden is on the plaintiff to show that a pleading can be amended successfully and that leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment.
