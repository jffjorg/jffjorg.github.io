And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge denied Plaintiff Sheida Ashley's motion for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint, which seeks to add a new cause of action for trespass based on alleged water intrusion trespass by Defendant Sharona Attarchi. The Judge found that the motion did not meet the procedural requirements of bringing a motion for leave to file an amended pleading, specifically failing to provide information as to when the facts giving rise to the proposed new cause of action were discovered. The Judge also noted that the delay in seeking leave to amend the complaint had not been justified, and that the proposed amendment would likely require different discovery than what had already taken place, which could prejudice the defendant.
