action against Defendants Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation
Authority (“Defendant”) and Does 1-25 for motor vehicle tort and general
negligence. 
On
June 26, 2023, Defendant filed an answer.

Courthouse for all purposes. 
On
May 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to deem admitted matters specified in
requests for admission and for sanctions, to be heard on June 13, 2024.  On May
31, 2024, Defendant filed an opposition.  On June 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply. 
Trial
is currently scheduled for October 2, 2024. 
PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission,
set one, served on Defendant and to impose sanctions on Defendant. 
Defendant
asks the Court to deny the motion and to impose sanctions on Plaintiff. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280 provides:           
“If a party to whom requests for admission are
directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the requests for admission are
directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its
determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The requesting party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(c) The court shall make this order, unless it finds
that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.)  
DISCUSSION 
On June
27, 2023, Plaintiff served requests for admission, set one, on Defendant.  Plaintiff granted Defendant several
extensions of time to serve responses. On
January 17, 2024 (the last day to serve responses), Defendant served unverified,
objection-only responses. Plaintiff
argues that the Court should deem admitted the matters specified in the requests
for admission, and impose sanctions on Defendant, because Defendant did not
serve verified substantive responses to the requests for admission. 
The
Court denies Plaintiff’s motion.  Code of
Civil Procedure section 2033.210, subdivision (b), authorizes objections to
requests for admission.  (See Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.210, subd. (b) [“Each response [to a request for admission] shall
answer the substance of the requested admission, or set forth an objection
to the particular request” (emphasis added)].) 
Verifications
are not required for objection-only responses. 
(See Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.240, subd. (a) [“The party to whom the
requests for admission are directed shall sign the response under oath, unless
the response contains only objections” (emphasis added)].) 
If
Plaintiff took issue with Defendant’s objections, Plaintiff's remedy was to file a
motion to compel further responses to the requests for admission under Code of
Civil Procedure section 2033.290. 
Plaintiff did not file a motion to compel further responses.  Instead, even though Defendant had served responses to the requests for admission, Plaintiff filed a misplaced motion to deem
admitted the matters specified in the requests. 
Plaintiff has not shown that Defendant "fail[ed] to serve a timely response" to Plaintiff's requests for admission for purposes of Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280.  The Court therefore denies the motion. 
The
Court also denies Defendant’s request for sanctions.  Defendant asserts that it served further
responses to the requests for admission on May 15, 2024, but the further
responses attached to Defendant’s opposition do not include a verification.
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES Plaintiff Shaletia Michelle
Cummings’s motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission,
set one. 
The
Court DENIES Plaintiff Shaletia Michelle Cummings’s request for sanctions. 
The
Court DENIES Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s
request for sanctions. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
