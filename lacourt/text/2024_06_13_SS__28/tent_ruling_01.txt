  Case Number:  19STCV23846    Hearing Date:   June 13, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On July
8, 2019, Plaintiffs Jessie Said, Jan Said, Jonear
Said, by and through their guardian ad litem Amira Youssef, and Amira Youssef
filed this action against Defendants Alexandra Fierro Houston and Larry F.
Houston as Trustees of the Houston Trust dated September 6, 2016 (“Trustees”),
Westwood Properties LLC, Westwood Properties Management Services, Inc., and
Does 1-75 for general negligence, premises liability, and negligent infliction
of emotional distress. 
On
July 26, 2019, the Court appointed Amira Youssef to serve as guardian ad litem
for Plaintiffs Jessie Said, Jan Said, and Jonear Said. 
On
March 12, 2021, the Court dismissed Westwood Properties LLC without prejudice
at Plaintiffs’ request. 
On
April 8, 2021, Trustees filed an answer and a cross-complaint against
Cross-Defendants Amira Youseff, Mamdoh Said, and Roes 1-50 for equitable indemnity,
apportionment of comparative negligence, and declaratory relief. 
On
June 9, 2021, Cross-Defendants Amira Youseff and Mamdoh Said filed an answer to
the Trustees’ cross-complaint. 
On
August 22, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a notice of settlement. 
On
May 20, 2024, Petitioner Amira Youssef (“Petitioner”) submitted a petition for
expedited approval of the compromise of minor Plaintiff Jessie Said’s claims. 
PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
asks the Court for expedited approval of the compromise of the pending action of minor Plaintiff
Jessie Said. 
DISCUSSION 
The
petition contains the following information about the proposed settlement: 
Gross
settlement amount:                              $50,000.00
Total
medical expenses:                                 $11,832.23
Reductions:                                                    $670.00
Payment/reimbursement
from proceeds:        $2,708.00
Liens:                                                             $5,717.65
(Medi-Cal)
Attorney’s
fees:                                             $12,453.79
Non-medical
costs:                                        $14,120.56
Net
balance:                                                   $15,000.00
 Section
13a(1) of the petition states that total medical expenses were $11,832.23.  Section 13a(3) of the petition states that
this amount was reduced by $670.00 as the result of negotiated, contractual,
and statutory reductions.  This should
mean that $11,162.23 will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement
proceeds.  However, Sections 13a(4) and
13a(5) of the petition state that only $2,798.00 plus $5,717.65 ($8,425.65) of
the medical expenses will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.  (See also Section 17b.)  As a result, $3,406.58 of the medical
expenses are unaccounted for.  The Court
cannot grant a petition to approve a minor’s compromise unless it shows that
all medical expenses that have not been waived or reduced will be paid or
reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. 
Section
13e of the petition states that Petitioner paid $830.70 in medical expenses.  It is not clear if Petitioner will be
reimbursed this amount out of the settlement proceeds or if Petitioner has waived reimbursement. 
Section
14b of the petition states that Petitioner is asking that the settlement
funds be used to pay $14,120.56 in costs. 
Petitioner should provide a breakdown of these costs and evidence showing
that counsel incurred these costs.  (The
Court has reviewed paragraph 9 of counsel’s declaration.) 
The
Court denies the petition without prejudice. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice the petition for expedited approval of the
compromise of minor Plaintiff Jessie Said’s action filed by Petitioner Amira Youssef on May 20, 2024. 
Petitioner
is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within
five days.
