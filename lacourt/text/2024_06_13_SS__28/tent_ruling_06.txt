 Case Number:  23STCV12201    Hearing Date:   June 13, 2024    Dept:  28 Having  considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows.  BACKGROUND  On  December 27, 2022, Plaintiff John Dunton (“Plaintiff”) filed this action in the  Ventura County Superior Court against Defendants Robert  Romo (“Defendant”) and Does 1-10 for intentional infliction of emotional  distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, negligence, and  declaratory relief.  On  May 31, 2023, the Court granted Defendant’s unopposed motion to transfer the  case to the Los Angeles County Superior Court.  On  July 20, 2023, Defendant filed an answer.  On April  16, 2024, Defendant filed motions (1) to compel Plaintiff’s responses to form  interrogatories, set two, and (2) to deem admitted matters specified in  requests for admission, set one.   Defendant also asked the Court to impose sanctions on Plaintiff.  The motions were set for hearing on June 13,  2024.  On June 13, 2024, Plaintiff's counsel informed the Court that he had served code-compliant responses to the requests for admission the evening of June 12, 2024.  Defendant's counsel responded that he had not had an opportunity to review the responses and could not state whether they substantially complied with Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.220.  The Court continued the hearing on the motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission to July 9, 2024 and granted the parties leave to submit supplemental papers on the issue of whether Plaintiff's responses to the requests for admission substantially comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.220.     Trial  is currently set for July 15, 2024.  PARTY’S REQUESTS  Defendant  asks the Court (1) to compel Plaintiff’s responses  to form interrogatories, set two, (2) to deem admitted matters specified in  requests for admission, set one, and (3) to impose sanctions on Plaintiff.  LEGAL STANDARD  A.   Interrogatories  Code  of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides:  “If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails  to serve a timely response, the following rules apply:  “(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are  directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under  Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including  one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4  (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that  party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following  conditions are satisfied:  “(1) The party has subsequently served a response that  is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and  2030.240.  “(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response  was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  “(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may  move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories.  “(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under  Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or  attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to  interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted  with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition  of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling  answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition  of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under  Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that  sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing  with Section 2023.010).”  (Code Civ. Proc., §  2030.290.)            B.       Requests  for admission            Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280 provides:            “If a party to whom requests for admission are  directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply:  “(a) The party to whom the requests for admission are  directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege  or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section  2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its  determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied:  “(1) The party has subsequently served a response that  is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230.  “(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response  was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  “(b) The requesting party may move for an order that  the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the  requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7  (commencing with Section 2023.010).  “(c) The court shall make this order, unless it finds  that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has  served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests  for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. It is  mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing  with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to  serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.)   DISCUSSION  On March  11, 2024, Defendant served form interrogatories, set two, and requests for  admission, set one, on Plaintiff.  Plaintiff  did not provide timely responses and had not provided responses by the time Defendant  filed these motions.  The Court grants Defendant's motion to compel responses to form  interrogatories, set two, and orders Plaintiff to provide verified code-compliant responses  to the form interrogatories without objections by July 12, 2024.  As noted above, the Court continues the hearing on Defendant's motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests for  admission to July 9, 2024. Defendant  requests $825.00 in sanctions on his motion to compel responses to form  interrogatories, set two.  Under Code of Civil  Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300, sanctions are available against  parties, persons, and attorneys who unsuccessfully make or oppose a motion to  compel a response to interrogatories. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd.  (c) [interrogatories].)  Plaintiff has  not made or opposed a motion to compel responses to interrogatories.  Therefore, sanctions are not available under  this statute.  Other  statutes addressing misuse of the discovery process do not, by themselves,  authorize a sanctions award for this motion. (See Code Civ. Proc., §  2023.010.)  Code of Civil Procedure  section 2023.010 is “ ‘definitional’ and monetary sanctions may not be imposed  based solely on [the statute]. Monetary sanctions may be imposed only if authorized  by some other provision of the Discovery Act.” (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal.  Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 8:1900, p. 8M-2;  see Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030 [court may impose sanctions for misuse of the  discovery process “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter governing any  particular discovery method or other provision of this title”]; City of Los  Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 498-504,  review granted Jan. 23, 2023 with order permitting citation of opinion for its  persuasive value and to establish the existence of a conflict in authority that  would “allow trial courts to exercise discretion . . . to choose between sides  of any such conflict.”)  California  Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a), provides: “The court may award sanctions under  the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery,  even though no opposition to the motion was filed . . . .”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1348(a).)  Because rule 3.1348(a) authorizes sanctions  “under the Discovery Act,” the Court may not award sanctions under rule  3.1348(a) except as the Discovery Act authorizes.  As explained above, the Discovery Act does  not authorize sanctions for Defendant’s unopposed motion to compel responses to  form interrogatories, set two.  Therefore, the  Court denies Defendant’s request for sanctions on the motion to compel.  CONCLUSION  The Court GRANTS Defendant Robert Romo’s motion to  compel responses to form interrogatories, set two, and orders Plaintiff John  Dunton to serve verified code-compliant responses to the form interrogatories  without objections by July 12, 2024.  The Court CONTINUES the hearing on Defendant Robert Romo’s motion to deem  admitted matters specified in requests for admission, set one, to July 9, 2024 at 1:30 p.m. in Department 28 of the Spring Street Courthouse.  The parties may file supplemental papers at least five days before the continued hearing addressing whether Plaintiff's responses to the requests for admission substantially comply with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.220. The Court DENIES Defendant  Robert Romo’s request for sanctions on his motion to compel responses to form  interrogatories, set two.   Moving  party is to give notice of the Court’s ruling.  Moving  party is to file proof of service of the Court’s ruling within five days.
