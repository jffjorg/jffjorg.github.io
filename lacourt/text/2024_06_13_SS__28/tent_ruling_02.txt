 Case Number:  20STCV18231    Hearing Date:   June 13, 2024    Dept:  28 Having  considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows.  BACKGROUND  On January  24, 2020, Plaintiff Hrach Agazaryan (“Agazaryan”) filed this action against  Defendants Amado De Borja, Betty De Borja, Lotus Restaurant, Axtamar Restaurant  (“Axtamar”), and Does 1-100 for negligence and assault/battery.  On  July 13, 2021, Agazaryan filed a first amended  complaint.  On  October 15, 2021, the Court sustained Axtamar’s demurrer to Agazaryan’s first  amended complaint with leave to amend. On  October 28, 2021, the Court sustained the demurrer of Defendants Amado De Borja and Betty De Borja to the first amended complaint.  The Court also dismissed Defendants Amado De  Borja and Betty De Borja without prejudice at Agazaryan’s request.  On  October 29, 2021, Agazaryan filed a second amended complaint against Defendants Amado De Borja, Betty De Borja, Axtamar,  and Does 1-100 for negligence and assault/battery.  On  January 27, 2022, the Court sustained Axtamar Restaurant’s demurrer to Agazaryan’s  second amended complaint with leave to amend.  On  February 16, 2022, Agazaryan filed a third amended complaint against Defendants Amado De Borja, Betty De Borja, Axtamar, and  Does 1-100 for negligence and assault/battery.  On  April 19, 2022, the Court (1) overruled Axtamar’s  demurrer to Agazaryan’s third amended complaint and (2) granted in part Axtamar’s motion to strike and struck all references  to Axtamar in the second cause of action.   The Court denied Axtamar’s request to strike the punitive damage claim  in the second cause of action.  On  August 18, 2022, the Court granted State  Farm General Insurance Company’s ex parte application to intervene.  On August  26, 2022, Plaintiff-in-Intervention State Farm General Insurance Company (“State  Farm”) filed a complaint-in-intervention against Defendants-in-Intervention  Agazaryan and Roes 1-20 “solely in [State Farm’s] capacity as liability insurer  of Defendant MAMKA, INC. dba LOTUS RESTAURANT (named herein as Defendant MAMKA,  INC. dba AXTAMAR RESTAURANT (formerly dba LOTUS RESTAURANT) . . . .”  On  April 25, 2024, State Farm filed (1) a motion to compel Agazaryan’s responses  to special interrogatories, set one, and for sanctions, and (2) a motion to deem  admitted matters specified in requests for admission, set one.  The motions were set to be heard on May 16,  2024.  Agazaryan did not file oppositions.  The Court continued the hearing to June 13,  2024.  Trial  is currently scheduled for October 1, 2024.  PARTY’S REQUESTS  State  Farm asks the Court (1) to compel Agazaryan’s responses  to special interrogatories, set one, (2) to deem admitted matters specified in  requests for admission, set one, and (3) to impose sanctions on Agazaryan.  LEGAL STANDARD  A.   Interrogatories  Code  of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides:  “If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails  to serve a timely response, the following rules apply:  “(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are  directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under  Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including  one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4  (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that  party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following  conditions are satisfied:  “(1) The party has subsequently served a response that  is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and  2030.240.  “(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response  was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  “(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may  move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories.  “(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under  Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or  attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to  interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted  with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition  of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling  answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition  of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under  Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that  sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing  with Section 2023.010).”  (Code Civ. Proc., §  2030.290.)            B.       Requests  for admission            Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280 provides:            “If a party to whom requests for admission are  directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply:  “(a) The party to whom the requests for admission are  directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege  or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section  2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its  determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied:  “(1) The party has subsequently served a response that  is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230.  “(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response  was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  “(b) The requesting party may move for an order that  the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the  requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7  (commencing with Section 2023.010).  “(c) The court shall make this order, unless it finds  that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has  served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests  for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. It is  mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing  with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to  serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.)   DISCUSSION  On  October 31, 2023, State Farm served special interrogatories, set one, and  requests for admission, set one, on Agazaryan.  Agazaryan  did not provide timely responses and had not provided responses by the time State  Farm filed these motions.  The Court grants State Farm's motion to compel responses to special  interrogatories, set one, and orders Agazaryan to provide verified code-compliant responses  to the special interrogatories without objections by July 12, 2024.  The  Court grants State Farm's motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests for  admission, set one, and deems admitted the matters specified in the requests for admission served on Agazaryan on October 31, 2023.  State  Farm requests $900.00 in sanctions on its motion to compel responses to the  special interrogatories.  Under Code of  Civil Procedure section 2030.290, sanctions are available against  parties, persons, and attorneys who unsuccessfully make or oppose a motion to  compel a response to interrogatories. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.  (c) [interrogatories].)  Agazaryan has  not made or opposed a motion to compel responses to interrogatories.  Therefore, sanctions are not available under  this statute.  Other  statutes addressing misuse of the discovery process do not, by themselves,  authorize a sanctions award for this motion. (See Code Civ. Proc., §  2023.010.)  Code of Civil Procedure  section 2023.010 is “ ‘definitional’ and monetary sanctions may not be imposed  based solely on [the statute]. Monetary sanctions may be imposed only if authorized  by some other provision of the Discovery Act.” (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal.  Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 8:1900, p. 8M-2;  see Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030 [court may impose sanctions for misuse of the  discovery process “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter governing any  particular discovery method or other provision of this title”]; City of Los  Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 498-504,  review granted Jan. 23, 2023 with order permitting citation of opinion for its  persuasive value and to establish the existence of a conflict in authority that  would “allow trial courts to exercise discretion . . . to choose between sides  of any such conflict.”)  California  Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a), provides: “The court may award sanctions under  the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery,  even though no opposition to the motion was filed . . . .”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1348(a).)  Because rule 3.1348(a) authorizes sanctions  “under the Discovery Act,” the Court may not award sanctions under rule  3.1348(a) except as the Discovery Act authorizes.  As explained above, the Discovery Act does  not authorize sanctions for State Farm’s unopposed motion to compel responses  to special interrogatories.  Therefore,  the Court denies State Farm’s request for sanctions on the motion to compel.  Sanctions  are mandatory for State Farm’s motion to deem admitted matters specified in  requests for admission.  (Code Civ.  Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  State  Farm requests $900.00 in sanctions based on four hours of attorney time at a  rate of $210.00 per hour and one $60.00 filing fee.  Counsel spent two hours preparing the moving  papers and anticipated spending one hour to review any opposition and prepare a  reply and one hour to attend the hearing.   The Court grants $690.00 in sanctions based on three hours of attorney  time and one filing fee.  CONCLUSION  The Court GRANTS Plaintiff-in-Intervention State Farm  General Insurance Company’s motion to compel responses to special  interrogatories, set one, and orders Plaintiff Hrach  Agazaryan to serve verified code-compliant responses to the  special interrogatories without objections by July 12, 2024.  The Court GRANTS Plaintiff-in-Intervention State Farm  General Insurance Company’s motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests  for admission, set one.  The Court deems  admitted the matters specified in requests for admission, set one, served on  Plaintiff Hrach on October 31, 2023.  The Court DENIES Plaintiff-in-Intervention  State Farm General Insurance Company’s request for sanctions on its motion to  compel responses to special interrogatories.  The  Court GRANTS Plaintiff-in-Intervention State Farm General Insurance Company’s  request for sanctions on its motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests  for admission.  The Court orders Plaintiff Hrach Agazaryan and his counsel to pay Plaintiff-in-Intervention State Farm General  Insurance Company $690.00 by July 12, 2024.  Moving  party is to give notice of the Court’s ruling.  Moving  party is to file proof of service of the Court’s ruling within five days.
