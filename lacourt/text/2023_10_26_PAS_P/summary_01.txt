Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the motion to enforce the settlement agreement between the parties. The parties entered into a Stipulation for Entry of Judgment on March 25, 2023, which provided for court enforcement and payments by defendants. However, defendants failed to make timely payments and breached the stipulation. The Court finds that the Stipulation is enforceable under CCP section 664.6 and that judgment is warranted in the amount of $231,000.00, which represents the unpaid amounts under the Promissory Note and unpaid rental damages through August 31, 2023. The Court also finds that the plaintiffs are not seeking a double recovery, as they are only seeking a single judgment in the amount of $231,000.00.
