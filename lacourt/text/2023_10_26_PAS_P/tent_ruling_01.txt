Case No.: 22BBCV00266 (related case no. 22BBCV00601) 
 
 
[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR ENFORCEMENT OF SETTLEMENT
 
Date: October 26, 2023
Time:  8:30 a.m.
Dept.:  P



 
 
          I.        INTRODUCTION
          This is a collections case
involving unpaid lease payments, related to an unlawful detainer case,
22BBCV00601. On March 25, 2023, Plaintiffs ACN Marketing Corp. and Ling Chau
Investments LLC (collectively Plaintiffs) entered into a Stipulation for Entry
of Judgment in this case and the related unlawful detainer case with Defendants
Mahmud Ulkarim and Megna Tofu Manufacturing Company, Inc. (collectively
Defendants). On March 28, 2023, the agreement was placed on the record in
22BBCV00601. On April 7, 2023, the Court dismissed the case without prejudice.
(April 7, 2023 Request for Dismissal.)
          Before the Court is a motion to enforce the settlement by
plaintiffs. As the stipulation provides for court enforcement and plaintiffs
provide evidence of the defendants failure to perform pursuant to the
stipulation, the Court GRANTS the motion to enforce the settlement. 
 
II.       LEGAL
STANDARD
          Under Code of Civil Procedure, section 664.6:¿ 
(a)¿If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the
parties outside¿of¿the presence of the court or orally before the court, for
settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter
judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties,
the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement
until performance in full of the terms of the settlement.¿ 
(b) For purposes of this
section, a writing is signed by a party if it is signed by any of the
following:¿ 
(1) The party.¿ 
(2) An attorney who
represents the party.¿ 
(3) If the party is an
insurer, an agent who is authorized in writing by the insurer to sign on the
insurer's behalf.”¿ (CCP § 664.6.)           
 
III.     ANALYSIS
A.
Retention of Jurisdiction 
 “‘[V]oluntary dismissal of an action or special
proceeding terminates the court’s jurisdiction over the matter.’  (Conservatorship
of Martha P. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 857, 867) [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 142.) ‘If
requested by the parties,’ however, ‘the [trial] court may retain
jurisdiction over the parties to enforce [a] settlement until performance in
full of the terms of the settlement.’ (§ 664.6, italics added.)”  (Mesa
RHF Partners, L.P. v. City of Los Angeles (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 913,
917.)  “‘Because of its summary nature, strict compliance with the
requirements of section 664.6 is prerequisite to invoking the power of the
court to impose a settlement agreement.’”  (Ibid. (quoting Sully-Miller
Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103
Cal.App.4th 30, 37).) 
“A
request for the trial court to retain jurisdiction under section 664.6 ‘must
conform to the same three requirements which the Legislature and the courts
have deemed necessary for section 664.6 enforcement of the settlement itself:
the request must be made (1) during the pendency of the case, not after the
case has been dismissed in its entirety, (2) by the parties themselves, and (3)
either in a writing signed by the parties or orally before the court.’”  (Ibid.
(quoting Wackeen v. Malis (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 429, 440).)  “The
‘request must be express, not implied from other language, and it must be clear
and unambiguous.’” (Ibid. (quoting Wackeen, supra, 97 Cal.App.4th
at 440).) 
Here,
the parties signed a Stipulation for Entry of Judgment (Stipulation) containing
the parties’ agreement for the Court to retain jurisdiction pursuant to CCP Section
664.6 to enforce the terms of the stipulation and enter judgment in the event
of default. (Stipulation ¶ 10.) Prior to the dismissal of this action, the
Stipulation was signed by the parties and submitted to the Court in the related
unlawful detainer action. (March 28, 2023 Minute Order.)  On April
7, 2023, the Court dismissed the entire case pursuant to the Stipulation. (April
7, 2023 Request for Dismissal.)
The
Court finds that the Stipulation complies with Section 664.6 requirements.  Thus, the Court has retained jurisdiction to
enter judgment pursuant to the Stipulation in this action. 
B.
Entry of Judgment
The
Stipulation Agreement provides that Plaintiffs and Defendants agreed to dismiss
the action if Defendants paid Plaintiffs the unpaid rent amount of $332,120.10.
(Exh. 1, p. 2: 3-4.) Pursuant to the Stipulation, Defendants would pay Plaintiffs
$16,000.00 on the first of every month, and $27,500 on the fifteenth of every
month, from April 1, 2023 to March 15, 2024. (Exh. 1, p. 3: 1-24.) The payments
due on the first of the month applied to the monthly rent and promissory note
payment for that month. The payments due on the fifteenth of the month applied
to the Settlement Payment. (Exh. 1, p.3 ¶ 4(c).) All parties signed the
Stipulation. (Id. at p.8.)
The
Stipulation also provides that if Defendants fail to make timely payments, “Civil
Case” Plaintiff’s counsel will serve a written Notice of Default on Defendants’
counsel and the individual defendant by email. (Id. at p.4, ¶ (f).) If
Defendant does not remedy the default within ten (10) days of receiving notice,
“Civil Case Plaintiff and UD Plaintiff may have the Judgment entered ex
parte, upon 24 hours ex parte notice… for possession of the
premises, forfeiture of the lease, that portion of the Settlement Amount and
monthly rental payments” (Id. at p.5, ¶ h.)
On
October 2, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the instant Motion alleging that Defendants
breached the stipulation.  They seek judgment
in the amount of $231,000.00 for the settlement amount. (Motion p.4: 14-17.)
On
July 15, Defendants made a payment of $2,500 to Plaintiffs. (Agemian Decl. ¶
5.) No payment was made August 1, 2023. (Id.) On August 15, 2023,
Defendants made a payment of $5,000 to Plaintiffs. (Id.) Plaintiff’s
counsel sent default notices to defendant and counsel of record for each
inadequate payment. (Id. at ¶ 8.) As of the date of this Motion,
Defendants have not made any additional payments, and there is an outstanding
balance remaining. (Id. at ¶ 7.) Plaintiffs thus seek to have judgment
entered in the amount of $231,000.00, representing the unpaid amounts under the
Promissory Note, and unpaid rental damages through August 31, 2023. (Motion,
p.4: 14-16, referencing Exh. 2 [Promissory Note incorporated into the Complaint
at Exh. 3.]) 
The
Court finds the Stipulation to be enforceable under CCP Section 664.6. 
Plaintiffs provide evidence that Defendants stopped making payments and did not
respond to Plaintiff’s written notices of default. (Agemian Decl. ¶¶ 5-8.)
Thus, the Stipulation was breached and as the Court retained jurisdiction to
enter judgment upon such breach, judgment can be entered. Plaintiffs have
also provided the Stipulation to show that they are entitled to the settlement
amount, less any payments made, as well as the unpaid amounts under the
Promissory Note. (Motion, Exh.2.)  
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motion to Enforce Settlement is GRANTED. Judgment is entered
for Plaintiffs and against Defendants for $231,000.00. 
 
C.
Double Recovery Not Permitted
          In opposition, Defendants argue that plaintiffs are not
entitled to a double recovery. (Opposition, p.2:13.) In support, defendants
cite Singh v. Southland Stone and Fujifilm Corp. v. Yang for the
proposition that “double recovery of damages is not permitted.” (Opposition,
p.2: 14-16.) In Singh v. Southland Stone, USA Inc., plaintiff Singh sued
both the owner of the company that employed him and the company itself. (Singh
v. Southland Stone, USA. Inc. (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 338, 344.) To the
extent that Singh supports the proposition that double recovery is not
permitted, the case discussed that CACI No. 361 [on reliance damages] should
not have been used with a special verdict. (Id. at 360.) However, this
does not clearly support Defendants’ point here, because Singh discusses
double recovery on the narrow issue of a special verdict on multiple counts and
the jury’s responsibility/ability to avoid duplicative recovery. (Id.) This
is not at issue in this case. In Fujifilm Corp. v. Yang, Fujifilm sought
to enforce a settlement agreement between itself and defendants. (Fujifilm
Corp. v. Yang (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 326, 334.) In Fujifilm, the
jury’s damage award was not double recovery because of facts specific to the
fraudulent transfers alleged in the case and testimony about the transfers. (Id.
at 335.) Though the case cites Singh for the proposition that double
recovery of damages is prohibited, it is unclear how the facts of Fujifilm apply
to the instant case.  To the extent that
defendants are arguing that plaintiffs are seeking a double recovery, the
argument is insufficient as defendants do not present evidence to support the
contention that plaintiffs are indeed moving for double recovery.  In fact, plaintiffs move for “Judgment in
favor of Plaintiffs against Ulkarim and Megna, jointly and severally, in
this case in the amount of 231,000.00.” (Reply, p.4: 2-5, see Proposed Judgment
p.1: 24.) The use of the joint and several language indicate that plaintiffs
are only seeking $231,000.00 once, not twice. 
          In sum, nothing clearly indicates double recovery is being
sought.
