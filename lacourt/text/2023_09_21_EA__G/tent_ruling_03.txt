Default Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Shea Center Walnut, LLC’s Application for
Default Judgment is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
This
is an unlawful detainer action. In April 2021, Plaintiff Shea Center Walnut,
LLC (Shea Center) leased a property in Walnut to Defendant Intellink Education
LLC (Intellink) for a term of three years. Subsequently, Intellink breached the
lease agreement by failing to pay rent and on March 14, 2023, Shea Center
served Intellink with a three-day notice to pay rent or quit. Intellink then
failed to comply with the notice.
On April
6, 2023, Shea Center filed a complaint against Intellink and Does 1-10, alleging
a cause of action for unlawful detainer. On April 27, Shea Center’s process
server personally served Intellink in Fullerton.
On May
8, 2023, default was entered against Intellink. On June 6, Shea Center
submitted the present application for default judgment.
A case
management conference is set for September 21, 2023.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
Shea
Center seeks default judgment against Intellink in the total amount of $17,543.94,
including $16,130.64 in damages, $873.90 in attorney fees, and $539.40 in costs.
Because the court finds Shea Center has submitted sufficient evidence, the
court GRANTS their application for default judgment.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Shea
Center’s application for default judgment is GRANTED.
