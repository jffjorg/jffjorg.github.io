The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Andes Harvest, Inc.'s application for a writ of attachment against Oceanus Decor & Flooring, Inc. without prejudice. The application was filed in a breach of contract action arising from a series of sublease agreements. The judge found that Andes failed to adequately allege how Oceanus breached the sublease agreement, specifically failing to identify the "required conditions" for the premises. The judge noted that the burden to establish the probable validity of Andes's claims rests with Andes, and the failure to demonstrate how Oceanus breached the sublease agreement is fatal to the application. The judge also noted that Andes's claims involve a contract or written agreement and that Andes seeks to secure $260,000, an amount greater than zero.

## English Summary

This is a tentative ruling from a judge regarding a request by Plaintiff Andes Harvest, Inc. to attach assets of Defendant Oceanus Decor & Flooring, Inc. 

Andes Harvest claims Oceanus breached a sublease agreement by failing to provide a functional electrical system, making the property unsuitable for Andes's business. Andes seeks $260,000 in damages, including costs and attorney fees.

While the judge acknowledges the existence of a contract and Andes's payment, the ruling denies the attachment request because Andes failed to sufficiently demonstrate how Oceanus actually breached the agreement. 

The sublease agreement doesn't specify any required conditions for the property, and Andes's argument that the lack of electricity constitutes a breach is not supported by specific contractual language.

Therefore, the court finds Andes has not met its burden of demonstrating a probable validity of its breach of contract claim, resulting in the denial of the writ of attachment. This denial is without prejudice, meaning Andes can reapply if they can provide stronger evidence of breach.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Andes Harvest, Inc. v. Oceanus Decor & Flooring, Inc. Andes Harvest, Inc. ("Andes") has applied for a writ of attachment against Oceanus Decor & Flooring, Inc. ("Oceanus") to secure payment of $260,000, including $12,000 in costs and $60,000 in attorney fees, for Oceanus's failure to return $182,420.08 pursuant to a sublease agreement. The judge has denied Andes's application for a writ of attachment without prejudice.

The judge found that Andes failed to adequately allege how Oceanus breached the sublease agreement. Andes claimed that the lack of a functioning electrical system "failed to satisfy the required conditions," but failed to identify what these "required conditions" were. The sublease agreement did not appear to state any required conditions for the premises, and Andes failed to point to such language. Since the burden to establish the probable validity of Andes's claims rests with Andes, the court found that Andes's failure to demonstrate how Oceanus breached the sublease agreement was fatal to Andes's application.

The judge noted that attachment is proper where the claim is one upon which an attachment may be issued, the plaintiff has established the probable validity of the claim upon which the attachment is based, the attachment is not sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon which the attachment is based, and the amount to be secured by the attachment is greater than zero. The court also noted that the burden to establish the probable validity of Andes's claims rests with Andes, and that Andes must be able to establish "the existence of the contract, plaintiff's performance or excuse for nonperformance, defendant's breach, and the resulting damages to the plaintiff."

* The court found Andes failed to adequately demonstrate how Oceanus breached the sublease agreement.


**English Summary:**

The judge denied Andes's request for a writ of attachment against Oceanus. While Andes claimed Oceanus breached their sublease agreement by failing to provide a functional property, the judge found that Andes did not provide enough evidence to support this claim. Specifically, Andes failed to point to specific language in the sublease agreement that outlined the required conditions for the property, including the electrical system. 

This denial is without prejudice, meaning Andes can reapply if they provide more convincing evidence of Oceanus's breach.

---

This tentative ruling denies Andes Harvest, Inc.'s application for a right to attach order and writ of attachment against Oceanus Decor & Flooring, Inc. The plaintiff has not demonstrated the probable validity of its breach of contract claim, as it has failed to adequately allege how the defendant breached the sublease agreement. The plaintiff has adequately alleged the existence of a contract and its performance, but it has not identified the required conditions that the defendant allegedly failed to satisfy. The burden to establish the probable validity of the plaintiff's claims rests with the plaintiff, and its failure to meet this burden is fatal to its application.
