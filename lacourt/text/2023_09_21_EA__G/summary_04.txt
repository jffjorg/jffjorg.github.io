And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Andes Harvest, Inc.'s application for a writ of attachment against Oceanus Decor & Flooring, Inc. without prejudice. The application was filed in a breach of contract action arising from a series of sublease agreements. The judge found that Andes failed to adequately allege how Oceanus breached the sublease agreement, specifically failing to identify the "required conditions" for the premises. The judge noted that the burden to establish the probable validity of Andes's claims rests with Andes, and the failure to demonstrate how Oceanus breached the sublease agreement is fatal to the application. The judge also noted that Andes's claims involve a contract or written agreement and that Andes seeks to secure $260,000, an amount greater than zero.
