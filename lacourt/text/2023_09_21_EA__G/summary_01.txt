And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion filed by M.B. Sturgis, Inc. and Weber-Stephen Products, LLC for a determination of good faith settlement with the Piersons. The motion was filed because the parties are seeking to bar any other joint tortfeasors or co-obligors from making further claims against the settling tortfeasors or co-obligors for equitable comparative contribution or partial or comparative indemnity based on comparative negligence or comparative fault. The judge found that the motion provided sufficient grounds for a good faith determination, including the fact that the settlement was reached in good faith and was free of any collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed at injuring the interests of non-settling parties. The judge noted that because there was no opposition filed, the court did not need to consider the factors set forth in Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates (1985) 38 Cal.3d 488.

Since no one objected to the settlement, and the defendants provided a good explanation for why it was reached in good faith, the Judge found it acceptable. This means that other defendants in the case (Enerco, Coloma Store, Worthington, Grand Gas, and Does 1-50) cannot later seek to blame M.B. Sturgis and Weber-Stephen for a larger portion of any damages awarded to the Plaintiffs.
