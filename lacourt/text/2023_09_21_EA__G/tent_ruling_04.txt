 Case Number:  23PSCV01816    Hearing Date:   September 21, 2023    Dept:  G Plaintiff Andes Harvest, Inc.’s Application for a
Right to Attach Order and Order for Issuance of a Writ of Attachment against
Defendant Oceanus Decor & Flooring, Inc.
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Andes Harvest, Inc.’s Application for a
Right to Attach Order and Order for Issuance of a Writ of Attachment against
Defendant Oceanus Decor & Flooring, Inc. is DENIED without prejudice.
BACKGROUND
This
is a breach of contract action arising from a series of sublease agreements. Defendants
Cups (DE) LP (Cups) and Wadd-II (TN) LP (Wadd) are alleged to be the owners of commercial
property in the City of Industry. Since 2001, Defendant Novolex Holdings, LLC
(Novolex) allegedly rented the City of Industry property from Cups and Wadd and
had been subleasing the property to Defendant Oceanus Decor & Flooring,
Inc. (Oceanus) since 2022. In May 2023, Plaintiff Andes Harvest, Inc. (Andes)
agreed to sublease the City of Industry property from Oceanus. After Andes made
a payment of $182,420.08 which included the first month’s rent and a security
deposit, Andes discovered the electrical system for the City of Industry
property had been removed. When Andes demanded return of first months’ rent and
security deposit in June 2023, Oceanus only offered to return the payment in
installments, Novolex denied liability, and Cups and Wadd both ignored Andes’s
demand.
On
June 20, 2023, Andes filed a complaint against Cups, Wadd, Novolex, Oceanus,
Zhigang Cui, CBRE, Inc. (CBRE), and Does 1-25, alleging the following causes of
action: (1) breach of contract, (2) breach of implied covenant of good faith
and fair dealing, (3) concealment, (4) conversion, (5) restitution, and (6)
breach of the duty of disclosure.
On
August 16, 2023, Andes filed the present application. A hearing on the
application is set for September 21 with a case management conference on
November 28.
ANALYSIS
Andes
moves for a writ of attachment against Oceanus. For the following reasons, the
court DENIES Andes’s application.
Legal Standard
Attachment
is proper where: (1) “[t]he claim is one upon which an attachment may be
issued;” (2) “plaintiff has established the probable validity of the claim upon
which the attachment is based;” (3) “[t]he attachment is not sought for a
purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon which the attachment is
based;” and (4) “[t]he amount to be secured by the attachment is greater than
zero.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 480.090, subd. (a); see also Bank of
America v. Salinas Nissan, Inc. (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 271 (Salinas
Nissan) [party pursuing attachment remedy carries burden of establishing
grounds justifying attachment, including presenting facts that show probable
validity of underlying claim].)¿ The court may issue an attachment on a claim
for money arising under contract, so long as the amount claimed by the party
seeking attachment is reasonably ascertainable in an amount greater than
$500.00.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 483.010, subd. (a).)
“Probable
validity means that ‘more likely than not’ the plaintiff will obtain a judgment
on that claim.” (Santa Clara Waste
Water Co. v. Allied World National Assurance Co. (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 881,
885, citing Code Civ. Proc., § 481.190.) Plaintiff’s application must “be
supported by an affidavit or declaration showing that the applicant, on the
facts presented, would be entitled to a judgment on the claim upon which the
attachment is based.” (Lydig Construction, Inc. v. Martinez Steel Corp. (2015)
234 Cal.App.4th 937, 944, citing Code Civ. Proc., § 484.030.) The affidavits
must set forth facts with particularity and a verified complaint may be
utilized in lieu of such affidavits. (Code Civ. Proc., § 482.040.) Furthermore,
any documentary evidence must be presented in admissible form. (Id., at
p. 944.)
Discussion
In
this case, attachment is proper because Andes’s claims involve a contract or a
written agreement. (See Klein v. Benaron (1967) 247 Cal.App.2d 607, 610.)
Additionally, Andes seeks to secure $260,000 which is an amount greater than
zero. Thus, the court now considers whether Andes established the probable
validity of Andes’s breach of contract claim.
Here,
Andes argues it is entitled to $260,000, including $12,000 in costs and $60,000
in attorney fees, for Oceanus’s failure to return $182,420.08 pursuant to the
sublease agreement. To establish a
claim for breach of contract, a plaintiff must be able to establish “(1) the
existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for
nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damages to the
plaintiff.” (Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th 811,
821.)
In this case, Andes entered into a sublease
agreement with Oceanus on May 3, 2023. (Lo Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. A.) On May 30, Andes
then made a payment of $182,420.08 which included $30,096 in rent for June 2023
and $152,324.08 for a security deposit. (Lo Decl., ¶ 7, Ex. B.) On May 31,
Andes discovered the electrical system for the City of Industry property had
been removed, making it unsuitable for Andes’s business purposes. (Lo Decl., ¶ 9.)
While Andes then requested the return of its $182,420.08 payment, Oceanus
failed to do so. (Lo Decl., ¶ 10-12.) Based on these allegations, the court
finds Andes adequately alleged the existence of a contract and Andes’s
performance in the form of the $182,420.08.
But, Andes failed to adequately allege how
Oceanus breached the sublease agreement. While Andes claims the lack of a
functioning electrical system “failed to satisfy the required conditions,”
Andes fails to identify what these “required conditions” were. (Lo Decl., ¶
19.) In fact, the only reference to electrical systems and utilities in the
sublease agreement states Andes is responsible for paying for any such utilities.
(Lo Decl., Ex. A., ¶ 3(c).) The sublease agreement does not appear to state any
required conditions for the premises and Andes fails to point to such language.
Because the burden to establish the probable
validity of Andes’s claims rests with Andes, the court finds that Andes’s
failure to demonstrate how Oceanus breached the sublease agreement is fatal to
Andes’s application.
Accordingly, Andes’s application for a writ of
attachment is DENIED without prejudice.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Andes’s
application for a writ of attachment is DENIED without prejudice.
