And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel arbitration and stay the action brought by Tesla, Inc. against the plaintiffs. The motion is granted, and the court sets a status conference to initiate arbitration for June 7, 2024. The court finds that the arbitration agreement is valid and enforceable, despite the plaintiffs' arguments that they opted-out of the agreement and that fraud in the inducement renders the contract, including the arbitration clause, voidable. The court also concludes that the McGill rule does not invalidate the subject arbitration agreement, as it does not purport to waive the right to seek public injunctive relief.
