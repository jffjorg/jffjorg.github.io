Discussion
Defendant
Screamline Investment Corporation demurs to the First Amended Complaint as
follows: 
1.         First Cause of Action (Breach of
Contract).
Defendant
argues that this cause of action is based upon a contract to which Defendant
Screamline is not a party. Attached as Exhibit A to the 1AC is a policy whereby
the named insured is Screamline Investment Corp., and the Insurer is New York
Marine and General Insurance Company, not Plaintiff Coaction Specialty
Insurance Group. Thus, Defendant argues, Plaintiff Coaction is not the real
party in interest and lacks standing to assert this cause of action.
Plaintiff
submitted a declaration of Erin Brennan-Bagley indicating that New York Marine
and General Insurance Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Plaintiff
Coaction. However, such extrinsic evidence cannot be considered on demurrer. In
this regard, Defendant’s objection to the Brennan-Bagley Declaration is
SUSTAINED.
 
“A demurrer tests the pleadings
alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear
on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed (Code Civ. Proc., §§
430.30, 430.70). The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the
complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of
action [citation].” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal. App. 3d 902, 905 [200 Cal. Rptr.
497].)


(Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
            Plaintiff
will be given one final opportunity to plead facts demonstrating that it is the
real party in interest as to this cause of action.
The
demurrer to the first cause of action is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
2.         Second
Cause of Action (Open Book Account).
            For
the reasons discussed above re: the first cause of action, there are
insufficient facts pled to demonstrate that Plaintiff is the real party in
interest as to this cause of action.
            Plaintiff
will be given one final opportunity to plead facts demonstrating that it is the
real party in interest as to this cause of action.
            The demurrer to the second cause of action is SUSTAINED
with leave to amend.
3.         Third
Cause of Action (Account Stated).
            For
the reasons discussed above re: the first cause of action, there are
insufficient facts pled to demonstrate that Plaintiff is the real party in
interest as to this cause of action.
            Plaintiff
will be given one final opportunity to plead facts demonstrating that it is the
real party in interest as to this cause of action.
            The demurrer to the third cause of action is SUSTAINED
with leave to amend.
4.         Fourth
