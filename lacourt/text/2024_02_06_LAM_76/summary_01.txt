And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to change venue filed by the Defendants, Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center, St. Joseph Health System, Donna Thorlakson, R.N., and Veronica Eldrake, R.N. The case is ordered transferred to the Orange County Superior Court. The Plaintiff is ordered to pay the change of venue fees within 7 days. The Judge finds that Orange County is the proper venue for the action, as at least one of the Defendants resides in Orange County. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff's argument that the Defendants' counsel directed the Plaintiff to use the St. Joseph's address in Pasadena is irrelevant to the residency analysis. The Judge concludes that the burden of proof is on the party moving for transfer to establish grounds for change of venue, and that the convenience of witnesses is not a relevant factor in this case.
