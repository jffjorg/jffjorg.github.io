And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant, Screamline Investment Corporation, has successfully demurred to the first four causes of action in the plaintiff's first amended complaint. The causes of action are for breach of contract, open book account, account stated, and quantum meruit. The judge has sustained the demurrer to each of these causes of action, but has given the plaintiff 30 days to amend its complaint to plead facts demonstrating that it is the real party in interest. The judge has also ruled that the plaintiff's declaration submitted in support of its complaint cannot be considered on demurrer, as it is extrinsic evidence. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to file a new amended complaint within 30 days, and has indicated that this will be the plaintiff's final opportunity to amend.
