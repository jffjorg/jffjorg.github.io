And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the motion for a nunc pro tunc order correcting the date of filing on the complaint. The complaint was filed on June 2, 2022, but the plaintiffs contend they filed it on May 31, 2022. The defendant was served with the summons and complaint on November 1, 2023. The motion is granted because the purported defect in the complaint was insubstantial and the rejection was not based on statute or the California Rules of Court. The tentative ruling also notes that the Court has the inherent authority to prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion and adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.
