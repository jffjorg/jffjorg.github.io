Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies Counsel's motion to be relieved as counsel due to the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The Court notes that Counsel has not provided sufficient information on the future proceedings in the case and that the service of the motion on the Plaintiff is unclear. The Court also requires Counsel to provide notice of the Court's ruling and file proof of service. The Court has the discretion to deny the application for withdrawal if it would work injustice upon a third party.
