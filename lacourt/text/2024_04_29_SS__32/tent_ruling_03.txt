TENTATIVE
RULING
 



DEPT:


32




HEARING DATE:


April
  29, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


21STCV03346




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  to Deem the Truth of Matters 




MOVING PARTY:


Defendant Levons Edgars Isajans  




OPPOSING PARTY:


Unopposed



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
            Defendant Levons Edgars Isajans (Defendant)
moves to deem admitted matters in the Requests for Admissions, Set One served
on Plaintiff Daniel Cedillos (Plaintiff, in pro per). Defendant also seeks
monetary sanctions. No opposition has been filed. 
 
            The hearing for this motion was
originally scheduled for April 17, 2024. However, the Court observed that
Plaintiff’s address in the proof of service for the discovery and motion did
not match the address for Plaintiff provided in the Order Granting Attorney’s
Motion to be Relieved. (Order, 7/24/23.)
 
            The Court continued the hearing so
Defendant’s counsel could file and serve an additional declaration regarding
the notice issue. (Min. Order, 4/17/24.) 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Where
there has been no timely response to a request for admission under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction.  (Code of
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)  The party who failed to respond
waives any objections to the demand, unless the court grants that party relief
from the waiver, upon a showing that the party (1) has subsequently served a
substantially compliant response, and (2) that the party’s failure to respond
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  (Code of
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subds. (a)(1)-(2).)  The court “shall” grant a
motion to deem admitted requests for admissions, “unless it finds that the
party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before
the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission
that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code of Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
 
The
Discovery Act does not define “substantial compliance” in the context of
service of a proposed response that complies with Code Civ. Proc., section
2033.220. The courts have ruled that “substantial compliance” means actual
compliance with all matters of substance and that technical deviations are not
to be given the stature of noncompliance. (St. Mary v. Superior Court (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 762, 779.) For example, unverified responses are not in
substantial compliance. (Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632,
636.) Additionally, RFA responses must be examined in their entirety. (St. Mary
v. Superior Court (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 780.) 
 
Unverified
discovery responses are tantamount to no response at all, and are subject to a
motion to compel responses (rather than a motion to compel further responses).¿
(Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal. App. 3d 632, 635-36.)¿
However, objections to discovery responses do not require a verification. (See Food 4 Less Supermarkets, Inc. v. Superior Court (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 651, 656.) 
 
Where
a party fails to provide a timely response to requests for admission, “[i]t is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendant’s counsel filed and served a declaration on April 17, 2024.
In it, he declares under penalty of perjury that on January 10, 2024, he served
a Request for Admission on Plaintiff using the address in the order relieving
Plaintiff’s counsel that was entered July 24, 2024. (Clark Decl. ¶ 3.) “Shortly
thereafter, the U.S. Postal Service returned the envelope, with a yellow
forwarding notice at the bottom, noting a new address for Plaintiff. The new
address listed by the U.S. Postal Service is: Daniel Cedillos, 13156 East
Avenue J, Lancaster, California 93535-8709.” (Id. ¶ 4, Exh. A.) Defendant’s
counsel has provided a photograph of the yellow forwarding notice as exhibit A.

 
The discovery and motion were mailed to the Lancaster address. Therefore,
considering this information, the fact that Plaintiff has not responded to this
motion, and that Plaintiff has not filed a change of address, the Court finds Plaintiff
was provided sufficient notice to rule on this motion. 
 
Here, Defendant asserts that he served Requests for Admissions, Set One
on Plaintiff on January 18, 2024. (Clark Decl. ¶ 2, Exh. A.) The responses were
due February 22, 2024. As of the date of filing this motion, no responses have
been served. (Id. ¶ 3.) Therefore, because responses were not served, the
motion to deem the truth of the matters is granted. 
 
Monetary sanctions are mandatory. Defendant seeks $3,157.50 in
monetary sanctions representing an hourly rate of $295 and the $60 filing fee.
However, the amount requested is excessive given no opposition was filed and
counsel can appear remotely at the hearing. Therefore, the Court awards $502.50
in sanctions (1.5 hours of attorney time plus the filing fee).
 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s Motion to deem the truth of matters in
Request for Admissions, Set One, is GRANTED.  
 
The Court further grants Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions
against Plaintiff in the reduced amount of $502.50. Said monetary sanctions
shall be paid to counsel for Defendant within 30 days of this order.  
 
Defendant
shall provide notice of the Court’s order and file a proof of
service of such.
