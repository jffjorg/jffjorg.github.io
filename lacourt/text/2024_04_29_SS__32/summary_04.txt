And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has considered the motion to contest the application for determination of good faith settlement. The Court finds that the motion was filed untimely, but declines to deny the motion on procedural grounds. The Court also finds that the declaration in support of the motion does not contain enough facts of Camden's proportional liability or the pertinent facts of the case. Therefore, the motion is denied. The moving party shall give notice of the Court's order and file a proof of service of such.
