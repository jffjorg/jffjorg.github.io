Background
On March 11, 2019, Plaintiff filed a
Complaint against Defendant Staples LLC, asserting various causes of action
including violation of Equal Pay Act, Sexual Harassment, Gender Discrimination,
Failure to Prevent, FEHA Retaliation, and Wrongful Termination.  On September 20, 2022, the Court of Appeal reversed
the trial court’s summary judgment order as to Plaintiff’s cause of action
against Defendant Staples LLC for Equal Pay Violation and remanded the matter
to this Court.
Defendant filed the instant motion on September 20,
2023.  Plaintiff filed her opposition on September
19, 2023.  Defendant filed its reply on September
28, 2023.
 
Legal Standard 
The motion for summary judgment shall
be granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as
to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a
matter of law.  (C.C.P. §437c(c).)
Under C.C.P. §437c, a grant of summary
adjudication can only be made if it completely disposes of a cause of action,
affirmative defense, a claim for damages, or an issue of duty.  (C.C.P. §437c(f)(1).)
“Once the defendant . . . has met that
burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show
that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of
action or a defense thereto.”  (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 849.)  “The plaintiff . . . may not rely upon the
mere allegations or denials of his ‘pleadings to show that a triable issue of
material fact exists but, instead, must ‘set forth the specific facts showing
that a triable issue of material fact exists as to that cause of action or a
defense thereto.”  (Id.)  “If plaintiff cannot do so, summary judgment
should be granted.”  (Avivi v. Centro
Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 463, 467.)
 
           Violation of CEPA (Lab. Code §1197.5) (1st COA)
A
cause of action for violation of CEPA requires a plaintiff to prove the
following elements: (1) plaintiff was paid less than the rate paid to (a)
person(s) of the opposite sex working for defendant; (2) plaintiff was
performing substantially similar work as the other person(s), considering the
overall combination of skill, effort, and responsibility required; and (3) plaintiff
was working under similar working conditions as the other person(s).  (CACI 2740.)
“To
prove a prima facie case of wage discrimination, ‘a plaintiff must establish
that, based on gender, the employer pays different wages to employees doing
substantially similar work under substantially similar conditions. [Footnote
omitted.]’ ‘If that prima facie showing is made, the burden shifts to the
employer to prove the disparity is permitted by one of the [CEPA]’s [four]
statutory exceptions—[such as,] that the disparity is based on a factor other
than sex.’ But a plaintiff must show ‘not only that she [was] paid lower wages
than a male comparator for equal work, but that she has selected the proper
comparator.’ ‘The [CEPA] does not prohibit variations in wages; it prohibits discriminatory
variations in wages. . . . [Accordingly,] “a comparison to a specifically
chosen employee should be scrutinized closely to determine its usefulness.”’” (Allen
v. Staples, Inc. (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 188, 194, internal citations omitted;
CACI 2740.)
Defendant’s
argument that this Court apply the burden shifting framework established in McDonnell
Douglas Corp. v. Green (1973) 411 U.S. 792, is misplaced.  (Rizo v. Yovino (9th Cir. 2020) 950 F.3d 1217, 1223,
en banc.)  The Ninth
Circuit stated in Rizo v. Yovino that dicta in previous cases had likely
caused confusion in Labor Code §1197.5 case law: 
To clear up
any confusion, we reiterate that EPA claims do not require proof of
discriminatory intent. [(See Maxwell v. City of Tucson (9th Cir. 1986)
803 F.2d 444, 446; see also Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.,
Inc. (2007) 550 U.S. 618, 640.)] EPA claims have just two steps: (1) the
plaintiff bears the burden to establish a prima facie showing of a
sex-based wage differential; (2) if the plaintiff is successful, the
burden shifts to the employer to show an affirmative defense. No showing of
pretext is required.  
 
(Rizo,
950 F.3d at pg. 1223, emphasis added.)
Plaintiff
sufficiently made a prima facie showing of a sex-based wage differential.  Specifically, Plaintiff submitted evidence
that multiple males made more than Plaintiff’s wage of $86,912.46 in the role
of Area Sales Manager (“ASM”) between April of 2017 and July of 2017.  (Plaintiff’s Additional Material Facts
[“P-AMF”] 139[1];
P-COE, Exh. 5 at Decl. of Desack ¶3 and Exh. A; Exh. 7.)  Plaintiff submitted
evidence that Brian Tweedy made $31,420.44 more than Plaintiff, and Michael
Steffon, James Rignall and Michal Klem also made more in wages than Plaintiff.  (P-AMF 140; P-COE Exh, 5;
Exh. 7.)  Plaintiff
submitted evidence that starting in July of 2017, in addition to Jeffrey Narlock
(“Narlock”), William Bradford and Timothy Trautz made more in wages than
Plaintiff in the position of Field Sales Director (“FSD”).  (P-AMF 141; P-COE Exh, 5; Exh. 7.)  Plaintiff met her burden to establish
a prima facie showing of a sex-based wage differential and therefore shifts the
burden to Defendant to show an affirmative defense.
Defendant
failed to meet its burden to show an affirmative defense that Narlock’s base
salary as an ASM and FSD was based on bona fide factors other than gender.  Defendant failed to attach Exhibits A-D to
the Declaration of Charles in support of Defendant’s Separate Statement of Fact
Nos. 36-40.
Assuming,
arguendo, Defendant met its burden to show an affirmative defense,
Plaintiff met her burden “to
show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the
defense thereto.”  (Aguilar, 25 Cal.4th at pg. 849.) 
Specifically, Plaintiff submitted evidence that multiple males made more
than Plaintiff’s wage of $86,912.46 in the role of ASM between April of 2017
and July of 2017.  (P-AMF 139.)  Plaintiff submitted evidence
that Brian Tweedy made $31,420.44 more than Plaintiff, and Michael Steffon,
James Rignall and Michal Klem also made more in wages than Plaintiff.  (P-AMF 140.) 
Plaintiff submitted evidence that starting in July of 2017, in addition
to Narlock, William Bradford and Timothy Trautz made more in wages than
Plaintiff in the position FSD.  (P-AMF
141.)  Therefore, Plaintiff met her
burden to demonstrate a triable issue of fact exists as to Defendant’s
affirmative defense of an application of bona fide factors other than gender.
 
Conclusion

motion for summary judgment is denied.
Defendant’s
motion in the alternative for summary adjudication is denied.
