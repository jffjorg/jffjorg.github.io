And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has denied Defendant Staples Contract & Commercial LLC's motion for summary judgment and motion in the alternative for summary adjudication. The motion was filed in response to Plaintiff Joyce Allen's complaint for damages, which alleges violation of the Equal Pay Act and other causes of action. The Court found that Plaintiff made a prima facie showing of a sex-based wage differential and therefore shifted the burden to Defendant to show an affirmative defense. Defendant failed to meet its burden to show that the wage rate differential between Plaintiff and her male comparator, Jeffrey Narlock, was based on bona fide factors other than gender. The Court also found that Plaintiff met her burden to demonstrate a triable issue of fact exists as to Defendant's affirmative defense. As a result, the motion for summary judgment and motion in the alternative for summary adjudication were denied.
