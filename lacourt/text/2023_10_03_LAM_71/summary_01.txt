## English Summary

The Judge denied both Defendant Staples Contract & Commercial LLC's motion for summary judgment and its alternative motion for summary adjudication. 

The case revolves around Plaintiff Joyce Allen's claim that she was paid less than male employees in comparable roles, violating the California Equal Pay Act.  The Judge found that Plaintiff presented enough evidence to establish a prima facie case of wage discrimination, shifting the burden to Defendant to prove their defense of bona fide factors other than gender justifying the wage differences. 

The Judge found that Defendant failed to meet this burden, specifically because they did not provide sufficient evidence to support their claims. Therefore, the case will proceed to trial where a jury will decide whether the wage disparities were indeed based on discriminatory factors.
