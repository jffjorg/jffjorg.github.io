Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by defendants Clyde Turner, Alfred Luciani, and Val Serebryany. The motion was unopposed and was granted without leave to amend. The judge found that the plaintiff, Impact Solutions, LLC, lacked standing to bring the lawsuit because the individual who initiated the lawsuit, Mark R. Moskowitz, was not authorized to do so. The judge also found that Moskowitz's removal from the management committee of Impact Solutions and his subsequent filing of a voluntary petition for bankruptcy rendered him unable to maintain the lawsuit. The judge cited various legal authorities, including California and Delaware statutes, to support its decision.
