Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by defendants Clyde Turner, Alfred Luciani, and Val Serebryany. The motion was unopposed and was granted without leave to amend. The judge found that the plaintiff, Impact Solutions, LLC, lacked standing to bring the lawsuit because the individual who initiated the lawsuit, Mark R. Moskowitz, was not authorized to do so. The judge also found that Moskowitz's removal from the management committee of Impact Solutions and his subsequent filing of a voluntary petition for bankruptcy rendered him unable to maintain the lawsuit. The judge cited various legal authorities, including California and Delaware statutes, to support its decision.

## Tentative Ruling Summary: Case No. 21STCV15143

**Case Number:** 21STCV15143
**Hearing Date:** October 3, 2023
**Department:** 71
**Plaintiff:** Impact Solutions, LLP
**Defendants:** Clyde Turner, Alfred Luciani, Val Serebryany, Russell Irby, Butler Snow, LLP, Catalin Tutunaru,  Serebryany Family Trust, Russell Brooks

**Key Points:**

* **Judgment on the Pleadings Granted:**  The Judge granted defendants Clyde Turner and Alfred Luciani's (and Serebryany's joinder) motion for judgment on the pleadings. This means the court found the Plaintiff's complaint legally insufficient.
* **Moskowitz's Lack of Authority:** The core issue is that Mark R. Moskowitz, who initiated the lawsuit in Impact Solutions' name, was found to lack the authority to do so.
* **Final Award and Judgment:** A previous arbitration and subsequent court judgment concluded that Moskowitz was removed from his management position in Impact Solutions and had no authority to act on the company's behalf.
* **Bankruptcy:** Moskowitz filed for bankruptcy, which further terminated his authority as a member of Impact Solutions under Delaware law.
* **No Leave to Amend:** The court denied Plaintiff's opportunity to amend the complaint, finding no reasonable possibility of curing the defect.

**Significant Statements:**

* "Moskowitz was properly removed from his position... and that Moskowitz 'had no authority to act on behalf of Impact Solutions, LLC.'" -  Final Award
* "Plaintiff cannot, as a matter of law, demonstrate that any amendment would cure the defect in the FAC." - Judge's ruling

**Laws and Statutes Cited:**

* California Code of Civil Procedure §438 (Judgment on the Pleadings)
* Delaware Limited Liability Company Act, 6 Del. C. §18-304(1)(b)


This summary provides a concise overview of the Judge's tentative ruling.

**English Summary:**

The judge has decided to dismiss Impact Solutions' lawsuit against Clyde Turner, Alfred Luciani, and Val Serebryany. The reason for the dismissal is that the person who filed the lawsuit on behalf of Impact Solutions, Mark R. Moskowitz, was found to lack the authority to do so. 

Previous rulings determined that Moskowitz was removed from his management position in Impact Solutions and had no authority to act on the company's behalf. Additionally, Moskowitz filed for bankruptcy, which further terminated his authority as a member of the company. 

The judge concluded that the plaintiff cannot fix these issues with any changes to the lawsuit, so the case is dismissed.

In this tentative ruling, the Judge grants the unopposed motion and joinder to motion for judgment on the pleadings of defendants Clyde Turner, Alfred Luciani, and Val Serebryany, without leave to amend.

Additionally, Moskowitz further relinquished any authority he might have had to maintain the lawsuit when he filed for bankruptcy. The Judge concludes that the plaintiff cannot demonstrate that any amendment would cure the defect in the FAC.
