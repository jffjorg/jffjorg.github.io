 Hearing
  Date:  October 3, 2023



 
Defendants Clyde Turner’s and Alfred Luciani’s,
and joining Defendant Val Serebryany’s unopposed motion and joinder to
motion, respectively, for judgment on the pleadings of Plaintiff Impact
Solutions, LLP’s first amended  complaint
is granted without leave to amend. 
 
Defendants Clyde Turner (“Turner”) and Alfred Luciani (“Luciani”)
(collectively, “Defendants”) move unopposed for judgment on the
pleadings asserted by Plaintiff Impact Solutions, LLP (“Impact Solutions”)
(“Plaintiff”) in its first amended complaint (“FAC”).  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2; C.C.P. §438; Evid.
Code §452.)  Defendant Val Serebryany
(“Serebryany”) (“Defendant”) joins Turner’s and Luciani’s motion and
incorporates by reference all arguments made therein.  (Notice of Joinder, pg. 1.)
 
Request for Judicial Notice
Serebryany’s 9/7/23 request for judicial notice of the (1) final judgment
against Mark R. Moskowitz (“Moskowitz”) signed by Hon.
Richard L. Fruin in Turner et al. v. Moskowitz, LASC Case No.
22STCP04179 (D-RJN, Exh. A); and (2) voluntary
petition for Chapter 13 Bankruptcy in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for C.D. Cal., filed
by Moskowitz in Case No. 23-bk-10792-MB (D-RJN, Exh. B), is granted.
 
Background
On April 21, 2021, Plaintiff filed its initial complaint.  On June 24, 2022, Plaintiff filed the
operative FAC against Defendants Russell Irby (“Irby”), Butler Snow, LLP
(“Butler Snow”), Catalin Tutunaru (“Tutunaru”), Serebryany, Serebryany Family
Trust (“Trust”), Turner, Russell Brooks (“Brooks”), and Luciani (collectively,
“Defendants”) alleging fourteen causes of action: (1) tortious interference
with existing economic advantage [against Irby, Butler, Serebryany, Trust,
Brooks, Turner, and Luciani]; (2) tortious interference with prospective
economic advantage [against Irby, Butler, Serebryany, Brooks, Turner, and
Luciani]; (3) violation of Securities Act of 1934 [against all
Defendants]; (4) violation of Securities Act of 1933 [against all
Defendants]; (5) breach of contract [against Tutunaru]; (6) breach of contract (count II- specific performance) [against
Tutunaru]; (7) breach of contract (count III- estoppel) [against
Tutunaru]; (8) fraud and deceit [against Tutunaru];
(9) breach of fiduciary duty (count I) [against Tutunaru, Brooks, Turner,
Serebryany, and Luciani]; (10) breach of fiduciary duty (count II) [against
Tutunaru, Brooks, Turner, Serebryany, and Luciani]; (11) waste of corporate
assets [against Tutunaru, Brooks, Turner, Serebryany]; (12) declaratory
relief [against all Defendants]; (13) accounting [against
all Defendants]; and (14) common counts [against Tutunaru].
 On September 6, 2023, Turner
and Luciani filed the instant motion. On September
7, 2023, Serebryany filed his joinder.  On September 26, 2023, Turner and Luciani
filed their reply.  As of the date of
this hearing, Plaintiff has not filed an opposition.
 
Legal Standard
C.C.P. §438 provides that a defendant may move for judgment on the
pleadings where: (I) the Court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the cause
of action alleged in the complaint; or (ii) the Complaint does not state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action against that defendant.  (C.C.P. §438(c)(1)(B).)  The grounds for a motion for judgment on the
pleadings must appear on the face of the challenged pleading or be based on
facts the court may judicially notice. (C.C.P §438(d); Tung v. Chicago Title
Co. (2021) 63 Cal.App.5th 734, 758-759.) 
 
Standing
A corporation may sue only upon authorization of its board of
directors or upon the initiative of its president or managing officer.  (See American
Center for Education, Inc. v. Cavnar (1978) 80 Cal.App.3d 476, 498; see
also Grosset v. Wenaas (2008) 42 Cal.4th 1100, 1108 [“The authority to
manage the business and affairs of a corporation is vested in its board of
directors, not in its shareholders. This includes the authority to commence,
defend, and control actions on behalf of the corporation.”].)
Moskowitz initiated the instant action in the name of Impact
Solutions without the authority to initiate, pursue, or maintain litigation in Impact
Solutions’ name.  Moskowitz was removed
from his role on the management committee of Impact Solutions through an amendment
to Impact Solutions’ operating agreement in September of 2020.  Moskowitz’s removal was deemed valid through a
Final Award issued by an Arbitrators Paul R. Fine, Judge Lawrence Crispo
(Ret.), and Robert Pearman in an AAA arbitration, Turner, Luciani, and
Brooks v. Moskowitz, Case No. 01-22-0000-5683.  (See D-RJN, Exh. A
at pg. 2.)  Pursuant to the Final
Award, the arbitration panel found that “Mark R. Moskowitz was properly removed
from his position on the Management Committee and as Chairman and as an Officer
of Impact Solutions, LLC” as of September 30, 2020, prior to his filing of the
instant lawsuit in April 2021, and that Moskowitz “had no authority to act on
behalf of Impact Solutions, LLC.”  (See
D-RJN, Exh. A at pg. 2.)
The Final Award was subsequently approved and confirmed by this Court,
resulting in a final March 3, 2023, judgment against Moskowitz signed by Hon.
Richard L. Fruin (“Judgment”) that confirmed Moskowitz’s valid ouster from any
management role in the Company, and that Moskowitz “had no authority to act on
behalf of Impact Solutions, LLC.”  (D-RJN, Exh. A at pg. 2.)  
Here, this case purports to be brought in the name of Impact
Solutions. However, even accepting the allegations in the pleading as true, the
FAC does not state facts sufficient to constitute a valid cause of action
because Moskowitz was not authorized to initiate, and is not authorized to
maintain, litigation in the
name of the Company.  (See
Hayes v. Risk (1967) 255 Cal.App.2d 613, 623-624.)
Moskowitz’s lack of authority has been conclusively established
through the Final Award and the Judgment, including the Court’s express finding
that “[f]ollowing his removal from the Management Committee, as Chairman, and
as an Officer, Mark R. Moskowitz had no authority to act on behalf of Impact
Solutions,
LLC.”  Therefore, the FAC fails
to state facts sufficient to constitute a valid cause of action.
Further, Under the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act, an
individual ceases being a member of a limited liability company when he or she
files a voluntary petition for bankruptcy. (6 Del. C. §18-304(1)(b).)  The Delaware Supreme Court has confirmed that
this law applies to multi-member LLCs to dissociate a bankrupt member’s rights
to participate in management of the LLC while retaining the pure economic
interest in the LLC as an asset of the bankrupt member’s Estate.  (See, e.g., Zachman v. Real Time
Cloud Servs. LLC (Del. 2021) 2021 WL 1561430, at *3, citing Milford
Power Co., LLC v. PDC Milford Power, LLC (Del.Ch. 2004) 866 A.2d 738, 762.)  Therefore, to the extent any authority
remained after the Final Award and Judgment, Moskowitz’s membership in Impact
Solutions ceased to exist immediately upon the filing of the Moskowitz Bankruptcy.  (D-RJN, Exh. B.)  Moskowitz did not have a membership interest
in Impact Solutions, and had no right or authority to initiate, pursue, or
maintain an action in the name of the Company.  (American Center for
Education, Inc., 80 Cal.App.3d at pg. 498.)
A motion for judgment on the pleadings may be granted with or
without leave to amend.  (C.C.P.
§438(H)(1).)  Leave to amend may be
granted when there is a “reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by
amendment.”  (Blank v. Kirwan (1985)
39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)  The burden of proof
in establishing that the defect can be cured “is squarely on the plaintiff.”  (Baughman v. State of California (1995) 38
Cal.App.4th 182, 187, citing Blank, 39 Cal.3d at pg. 318.)
Here, Plaintiff cannot, as a matter of law, demonstrate that any
amendment would cure the defect in the FAC.  As noted above, Moskowitz has been found to lack
standing to initiate the instant matter, and under Delaware law, Moskowitz
further relinquished any authority he might have had to maintain this lawsuit
when he filed his Petition for Bankruptcy. 
           Accordingly, Turner’s and Luciani’s motion for judgment on the pleadings is
granted without leave to amend.
 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, Turner’s, Luciani’s, and Serebryany’s motion
for judgment on the pleadings as to the FAC is granted without leave to
amend. 
Moving Party to give notice of this ruling.
