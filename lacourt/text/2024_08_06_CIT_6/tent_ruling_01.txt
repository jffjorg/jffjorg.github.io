  Case Number:  21STCV31632    Hearing Date:   August 6, 2024    Dept:  6 CASE  NAME:  Nicholas  Muso, et al. v. Sevadham Management, LP, et al.  1  – Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Responses to Requests for Admissions, Set One;  and 2  – Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Responses to Plaintiffs’ Form Interrogatories,  Set Two  TENTATIVE  RULING  The Court GRANTS  Plaintiffs’ motions to compel responses to Requests for Admissions, Set One,  and Form Interrogatories, Set Two. Sevadham must provide verified responses,  without objection, to Plaintiffs’ Form Interrogatories, Set Two, within 30 days  of the Court’s order. The Court further DEEMS the genuineness of the documents  and the truth of the matters specified in Requests for Admissions, Set One,  admitted and conclusively established as to Sevadham.  Plaintiffs are ordered to give notice of the Court’s ruling within  five calendar days of this order.  BACKGROUND  This is an elder abuse and wrongful death action. On August 26,  2021, plaintiff Patricia Muso, individually and as representative of decedent Nicholas  Muso (collectively, Plaintiffs), filed this action against defendants Sevadham  Management, LP dba Mountain View Centers Claremont Memory Care (Sevadham), Does  1 through 25, plus Nicholas Anthony Muso and Kathryn Muso as nominal  defendants, alleging causes of action for dependent adult abuse and neglect,  violation of patient rights, negligence, and wrongful death.  On July 11, 2024, Plaintiffs moved to compel responses to Requests  for Admissions, Set One, and Form Interrogatories, Set Two. The motions are  unopposed.  LEGAL  STANDARD  When a party fails to serve a timely response  to interrogatories, the party propounding the interrogatories may move for an  order compelling a response. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) A party  who fails to provide a timely response waives any objection, including one  based on privilege or work product. (Id., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) “The  court shall impose a monetary sanction… against any party, person, or attorney  who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to  interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted  with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition  of the sanction unjust.” (Id., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)  When a party fails to serve a timely response  to a request for admission, the party propounding the request for admission may  move for an order to deem the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any  matters specified in the requests admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,  subd. (b).) A party who fails to provide a timely response waives any  objection, including one based on privilege or work product. (Id., §  2033.280, subd. (a).) “The court shall make this order, unless it finds that  the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served,  before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for  admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. It is  mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction… on the party or attorney,  or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission  necessitated this motion.” (Id., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  DISCUSSION  Meet and Confer  Although meeting and conferring is not required before bringing  motions to compel, (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific  Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404), the Court  appreciates Plaintiffs’ efforts to meet and confer with Sevadham before  bringing this motion, including by telephone. (Oghassabian Decl., ¶¶ 11-14; see  Dept. 6 Courtroom Information [“Parties are required to meet and confer in  person, by telephone, or by video conference before bringing any motion.”])              Analysis  Plaintiffs  indicate that they served Requests for Admissions, Set One, and Form  Interrogatories, Set Two, on Sevadham on May 3, 2024. (Oghassabian Decls., ¶¶ 7-8;  Motions, Ex. C.) Sevadham has not responded to the requests, despite  Plaintiffs’ meet-and-confer efforts. (Oghassabian Decls., ¶¶ 11-15, Ex. D.) The  Court finds Plaintiffs’ motion to be well taken. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS  Plaintiffs’ motion to compel responses to Form Interrogatories, Set Two.  Sevadham must provide verified responses, without objection, to Plaintiffs’  Form Interrogatories, Set Two, within 30 days of the Court’s order.  The Court notes that Plaintiffs actually requested the Court to  compel Sevadham to provide responses to Requests for Admissions, Set One.  (Notice, 1:25-2:2; Motion, 8:1-5.) However, Code of Civil Procedure section  2033.280, which governs a motion regarding a failure to respond to requests for  admissions, only provides a remedy of deeming the genuineness of any documents  and the truth of any matters specified in the requests for admissions admitted,  as well as for monetary sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)  The Court therefore construes Plaintiffs’ motion as requesting that the  genuineness of the documents and the truth of the matters specified in  Plaintiffs’ Requests for Admissions, Set One, be deemed admitted. The Court GRANTS the motion to  compel as to Requests for Admissions, Set One, and hereby DEEMS the genuineness  of the documents and the truth of the matters specified in Requests for  Admissions, Set One, admitted and conclusively established as to Sevadham.  Additionally,  the Court notes that although Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280,  subdivision (c), states that monetary sanctions are mandatory when a party’s  failure to respond necessitates the motion, Plaintiffs did not request monetary  sanctions. The Court cannot impose monetary sanctions when they have not been  requested. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.040; Albrecht v. Superior Court¿(1982) 132  Cal.App.3d 612, 619 [“Notice and an opportunity to be heard must precede  deprivations of life, liberty or property.”]) Accordingly, no monetary sanctions will be  awarded here.  CONCLUSION  The Court GRANTS  Plaintiffs’ motions to compel responses to Requests for Admissions, Set One,  and Form Interrogatories, Set Two. Sevadham must provide verified responses,  without objection, to Plaintiffs’ Form Interrogatories, Set Two, within 30 days  of the Court’s order. The Court further DEEMS the genuineness of the documents  and the truth of the matters specified in Requests for Admissions, Set One,  admitted and conclusively established as to Sevadham.  Plaintiffs are ordered to give notice of the Court’s ruling within  five calendar days of this order.
