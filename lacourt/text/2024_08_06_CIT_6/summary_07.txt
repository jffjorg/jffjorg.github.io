And here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants in this boundary dispute case. The judge has overruled the demurrer to the complaint, denying the defendants' attempts to strike the complaint based on the alleged encroachments being permanent and therefore subject to a three-year statute of limitations. The judge has concluded that the alleged encroachments are not permanent and therefore not subject to the statute of limitations. The judge has also denied the defendants' requests for judicial notice regarding the construction of the alleged encroachments. As a result, the plaintiffs are ordered to give notice of the court's ruling within five calendar days, and the defendants must file and serve their answer to the complaint within 20 days.
