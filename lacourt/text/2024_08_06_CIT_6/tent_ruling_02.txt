 Case Number:  22PSCV00749    Hearing Date:   August 6, 2024    Dept:  6 CASE  NAME:  Glenn  Man Ching Fong, et al. v. Zhu Ling Peng  Motion  of Partition Referee for Discharge and for Instructions Regarding Disposition  of Sale Proceeds  TENTATIVE  RULING  The Court GRANTS the motion of partition referee for discharge and  for instructions regarding disposition of sale proceeds. The Court will sign  the proposed order submitted with the motion.               Partition Referee is ordered to give  notice of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.  BACKGROUND  This is a partition action. On July 21, 2022, plaintiffs Glenn Man  Ching Fong, an individual and as Trustee of the G and D Fong Family Trust, and  Diana Man Ling Fong, an individual and as Trustee of the G and D Fong Family  Trust (collectively, Plaintiffs), filed this action against defendant Zhu Ling  Peng (Defendant) and Does 1 to 10, alleging the sole cause of action for  partition.  On July 1, 2024, Matthew L. Taylor (Partition Referee) moved to be  discharged and for instructions regarding the disposition of sale proceeds. The  motion is unopposed.  LEGAL  STANDARD              “The referee or any party may, on noticed motion,  petition the court for instructions concerning the referee's duties under this  title.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 873.070.)  DISCUSSION  Summary  of Motion  Partition  Referee seeks to be discharged as Partition Referee, and seeks instructions  regarding disposition of the remaining sales proceeds held by Partition  Referee. Partition Referee indicates that he closed escrow on the sale of the  subject property for $720,000.00 in December 2023, and that following payment  by the escrow officer of customary sale costs, such as broker commissions,  title insurance, and property taxes, Partition Referee received a total of  $656,386.64, which includes the buyers’ initial deposit of $21,900.00 paid  outside of escrow. Partition Referee then paid various administrative costs  incurred by Partition Referee, such as court filing fees, bank fees, bond  charges, publication charges, messenger fees, and property maintenance costs,  including gardening, interior repairs, and utilities. Partition Referee is now  currently holding $648,854.49 and seeks further instructions from the Court as  to the distribution of these remaining proceeds.  Partition  Referee seeks the Court’s approval of the distribution of the sale proceeds as  follows:-           $25,421  for Partition Referee’s services rendered in this matter; -           $330,970.98  to Plaintiffs; and -           $292,462.51  to Defendant.  Analysis  The Court finds  Partition Referee’s motion to be well taken. Partition Referee’s fees of  $25,421 appear reasonable in light of Partition Referee’s work over the past  two years since this action was filed. First, Partition Referee’s rate of $300  an hour is reasonable for the relevant legal community. “The courts repeatedly  have stated that the trial court is in the best position to value the services  rendered by the attorneys in his or her courtroom [citation], and this includes  the determination of the hourly rate that will be used in the lodestar  calculus. [Citation.]” (569 E. Cnty. Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry Against  the Dump, Inc. (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 426, 436-437.) Second, Partition  Referee provided a cost bill that supports the amount requested. (Taylor Decl.,  Ex. 3.) “[I]tems on a verified cost bill are prima facie evidence the costs,  expenses and services listed were necessarily incurred…” (Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682.)              The Court next  finds the proposed distribution of sale proceeds between the parties to be fair  and reasonable. (Report and Recommendation of Partition Referee in Connection  with Real Property Partition Sale Proceeds and Claims (Report), Final  Calculations, 23:1-15.) Partition Referee’s report makes clear that only  Plaintiffs submitted claims for reimbursements, the majority of which were  properly supported by evidence. (Report, 10:1-11:20.) The report also makes  clear that Plaintiffs’ request for award of attorney fees and costs is proper  with respect to the attorney fees, but $5,000.00 of the costs sought were  improper. (Report, 11:23-15:13.) Accordingly, Plaintiffs are to be reimbursed  $43,849.91. (Report, 21:10-19.)  The Court further  agrees with Partition Referee that there is insufficient evidence to support  Plaintiffs’ argument that Defendant should bear responsibility for 100% of  Partition Referee’s fees. (Report, 15:15-16:23.) But, the $6,646.56  attributable solely to Defendant, i.e., eviction related costs and fees, should  be borne by Defendant. (Report, 16:24-17:23.) The Court also agrees with  Partition Referee that $5,994.00 should be reallocated to Defendant as  compensation for the Franchise Tax Board fees deducted from the gross sales  proceeds, which fees were attributable solely to Plaintiffs. (Report, 18:1-26.)  Finally, the  Court construes the lack of opposition from the parties as a tacit approval of  the proposed distribution of sales proceeds here. (See Sexton v. Superior  Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410; C. Opposing the Motion—and  Rebutting the Opposition, Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial Ch. 9(I)-C,  ¶ 9:105.10; see also Moulton Niguel Water Dist. v.  Colombo (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1210, 1215 [“Contentions are waived  when a party fails to support them with reasoned argument and citations to  authority. [Citation.]”)                        Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS  Partition Referee’s motion as follows: 1.       Partition  Referee is DISCHARGED upon payment of the remaining sale proceeds as specified  herein; 2.       Partition  Referee is to receive $25,421.00 for his professional fees from the remaining  sale proceeds; 3.       Plaintiffs  are to receive $330,970.98 from the remaining sale proceeds; and 4.       Defendant is  to receive $292,462.51 from the remaining sale proceeds.  The Court  will sign the proposed order submitted with the motion.  CONCLUSION  The Court GRANTS the motion of partition referee for discharge and  for instructions regarding disposition of sale proceeds. The Court will sign  the proposed order submitted with the motion.               Partition Referee is ordered to give  notice of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.
