[1] The Court
notes that a new version of Labor Code section 2699 went into effect on July 1,
2024, i.e., after Plaintiffs filed this motion, but it does not apply
retroactively. (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (v)(1), eff. July 1, 2024.)
Accordingly, any references to the Labor Code herein refer to the version in
effect when Plaintiffs filed this action.
