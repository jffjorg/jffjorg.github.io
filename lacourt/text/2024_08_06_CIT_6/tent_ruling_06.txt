BACKGROUND 
This is a personal injury action. On November 16, 2023, plaintiff Javier
Flores Jr. (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants Martin Perez,
Baldwin Crest Homes, and Does 1 through 20, alleging causes of action for
negligence, premises liability, and negligence-statutory liability. 
On
July 11, 2024, Ramin
R. Younessi of Law Offices of Ramin R. Younessi moved to be relieved as counsel
for Plaintiff. The motion
is unopposed. 
LEGAL
STANDARD
The Court has
discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be
granted, provided that there is no prejudice to the client, and it does not
disrupt the orderly process of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d
398, 403-407.) 
A motion to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Council
Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053
(Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) The requisite forms must be served “on the client and on all
parties that have appeared in the case.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362,
subd. (d).) 
DISCUSSION 
Ramin R. Younessi of Law Offices of Ramin R. Younessi (Counsel) seeks to be relieved as
counsel for Plaintiff. Counsel indicates there has been a breakdown in the
attorney-client relationship. (Younessi Decl., ¶ 2.) The Court finds this
sufficient grounds for withdrawal. A breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is also grounds
for allowing the attorney to withdraw. (Estate of Falco (1987) 188
Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014.) Grounds for permitting an attorney to withdraw from
representation also include the client’s conduct that “renders it unreasonably
difficult for the lawyer to carry out the representation effectively[.]” (Cal.
Rules of Professional Conduct, rule 1.16, subd. (b)(4).) 
Counsel has provided the required application, declaration, and
proposed order on Judicial Council forms MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) Counsel also has filed a
proof of service of same on Plaintiff. (Proof of Service (7/11/24).) 
However, Counsel’s declaration indicates having only conducted a
Transunion search within 30 days of filing the motion to confirm that
Plaintiff’s address is current. (Younessi Decl., ¶ 3, subd. (b)(1).) The Court
does not find this to be sufficient to confirm Plaintiff’s address. The options
listed under paragraph 3, subdivision (1), of the declaration are methods that
require some sort of response from the client, such as certified mail return
receipt requested, telephone, or conversation. (See Younessi Decl., ¶ 3, subd.
(b)(1).) A Transunion search requires no such response. The Court also notes
that future hearing date information has changed since Plaintiff filed this
motion, which could otherwise be addressed in a revised proposed order. 
Therefore, the Court DENIES the motion without prejudice. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES the motion of Ramin R. Younessi of Law Offices of
Ramin R. Younessi to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff without prejudice. 
Counsel is ordered to give notice of this ruling and file proof of
service of same within five calendar days.
