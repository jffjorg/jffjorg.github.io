SAP, ¶39.


[2] In
support of its demurrer, Caltrans seeks judicial notice of the following two
exhibits authenticated by declaration: (a) Chapter 10 of the Caltrans’
Right of Way Manual (Ex. A) and (b) an image from Google Maps which provides
that the distance between the Property and the Bank Property is roughly 0.5
miles (Ex. B).  Exhibits A-B are
judicially noticed.  Evid. Code §452(c),
(h).
Megeen submits
declarations from herself and Ryan as well as supporting exhibits.  Caltrans correctly states that this evidence
cannot be considered.  A demurrer
tests the sufficiency of a pleading, and the grounds for a demurrer must appear
on the face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable matters.  CCP §430.30(a); Blank v. Kirwan,
(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.  The only
admissible evidence on demurrer is evidence concerning the meet-and-confer
obligation and authentication of exhibits for which a party  requests judicial notice.  The court has not considered Megeen’s
evidence.

[4] Megeen separately
moves for leave to amend to add a third cause of action for mandamus pursuant
to the CRAA.  As there is no need to amend, the motion is denied.
