```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has reviewed the case of Scagliotti, who was terminated from his job for being a convicted felon. LACMA argues that Scagliotti's behavior is unbecoming of a County employee, while Scagliotti contends that his termination is unconstitutional. The judge notes that LACMA's remedy for improperly excluded evidence is a judgment of remand for the agency to reconsider the case in the light of that evidence. The judge also finds that LACMA incorrectly refers to the weight of the evidence and that Scagliotti was neither a new applicant nor did he apply for a different position. The judge concludes that Scagliotti's termination was lawful and that the court need not address the relevance of Policy 514.
