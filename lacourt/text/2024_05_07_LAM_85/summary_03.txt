**Case Summary**

The tentative ruling in this case concerns a dispute between Megeen McLaughlin and the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) regarding a property that Megeen used to occupy. Caltrans demurred to the second cause of action in Megeen's complaint, alleging that the California Relocation Assistance Act (CRAA) does not apply to this case. The CRAA is a state law that provides relocation benefits to persons displaced by state or local acquisitions.

The CRAA defines a "public entity" as an entity acquiring real property or any interest therein in any city or county for public use. Megeen argues that Caltrans is a public entity and that the CRAA applies to her situation.

The court must determine whether the CRAA applies to Megeen's case and whether Caltrans is a public entity within the meaning of the CRAA.

**Applicable Law**

The CRAA is a state law that provides relocation benefits to persons displaced by state or local acquisitions. The CRAA defines a "public entity" as an entity acquiring real property or any interest therein in any city or county for public use.

**Facts**

Megeen was a tenant in a property that was renovated by Caltrans. Megeen vacated the property in 1999 and was promised that she would be allowed to return to the property after its renovation. However, Megeen was not allowed to return to the property and is seeking to enforce her right to return.

**Issues**

1. Whether the CRAA applies to Megeen's case
2. Whether Caltrans is a public entity within the meaning of the CRAA
3. Whether Megeen is a displaced person within the meaning of the CRAA

**Procedural History**

Megeen filed a complaint against Caltrans, alleging that Caltrans breached its promise to allow her to return to the property. Caltrans demurred to the complaint, arguing that the CRAA does not apply to Megeen's case.
