Averkiyeva v. Petrowizky, et al.MOTION TO VACATE JUDGMENT
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Respondent Raisa Petrowizky’s Amended Motion to Vacate
Judgment is DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
Only August 26, 2022, the Court entered judgment in favor of
Liudmila Averkiyeva (“Petitioner”) and against Raisa Petrowizky (“Respondent”)
pursuant to an Order, Decision or Award of the Labor Commissioner. Respondent
filed a Motion to Vacate Judgment on December 21, 2023. At the hearing on
January 29, 2024, the Court continued the hearing to allow Respondent to file a
memorandum of points and authorities. (Minute Order, 01/29/24.) On January 31,
2024, the parties filed a stipulation to allow California Labor Commissioner,
Division of Labor Standards Enforcement, Department of Industrial Relations,
State of California to intervene in this action. The Court granted the
stipulation the same date. (Stip and Order, filed 01/31/24.) 
 
Respondent filed the instant Amended Motion to Vacate
Judgment on April 22, 2024. Intervenor filed an opposition on May 14, 2024. 
 
Discussion
 
Respondent brings the instant
Amended Motion on grounds of lack of due process as set forth in case law. (Citing
North Georgia Finishing, Inc. v. Di-Chem, Inc. (1975) 419 U.S. 601, 605;
Skelly v. State Personnel Bd. (1975) 15 Cal.3d 194, 207; Randone v.
Appellate Department (1971) 5 Cal.3d 536, 541.) She argues that Intervenor
failed to serve notice of the Labor Commissioner hearing to her correct
address, 10741 Ashby Ave., Los Angeles, California. In opposition, Intervenor
argues that Respondent failed to update her address as instructed and that
notice of the hearing was correctly served to the address on file. The relevant
facts regarding service of the notice of the Labor Commissioner hearing are as
follows:
 
On January 18, 2017, Petitioner
filed a wage claim against Respondent, as an individual, and AAA Interconnect,
Inc. (“AAA”). (Amended Motion, Petrowizky Decl., ¶2 and Exh. A at p. 1.) On
July 11, 2017, Intervenor sent a Notice of Claim and Conference to Respondent
and AAA at 6007 Lankershim Boulevard #4, North Hollywood, California. (Opp.,
Corleto Decl., Exh. 2, p. 1.) Immediately under the list of claims, in bold
lettering, is the admonishment: “While this claim is before the Labor
Commissioner, you are required under Labor Code Section 98(a) to notify the
Labor Commissioner in writing of any change in your business or personal
address within 10 days after any change occurs.” (Id. at Exh. 2, p. 2.) 
 
The parties attended a
settlement conference on August 10, 2017, at which time Respondent appeared on
behalf of herself and AAA. (Id. at Exhs. 2-3.) On the attendance sheet,
Respondent listed her address as 6007 Lankershim Boulevard #4, North Hollywood,
California. (Id. at Exh. 3.) In August 2019, Respondent began using the
Ashby Avenue address for AAA with various entities including the State
Compensation Insurance Fund, the Franchise Tax Board, and Wells Fargo Bank.
(Amended Motion, Petrowizky Decl., Exh. B.) However, no change of address was
communicated to Intervenor. (Opp., Corleto Decl., ¶¶8-9.) 
 
On May 11, 2021, Intervenor sent
notice of the hearing to Respondent, individually and as agent for service of
process for AAA, at the Lankershim address, setting the hearing date for June
22, 2021. (Id. at Exh. 4.) At the time, the Lankershim address was
listed for Respondent in AAA’s most recent statement of information with the
Secretary of State, as the company’s CEO, CFO, sole director, President, and
agent for service of process. (Opp., RJN, Exh. 1.) Also, a week before the
hearing, a “no change statement” was filed with the Secretary of State for AAA
certifying that there has been “no change of any of the information contained
in the previous complete Statement of information filed with the California
Secretary of State.” (Id. at Exhs. 2-3.) Finally, Intervenor checked the
United States Postal Service tracking information regarding the notice of
hearing and saw it was delivered and left with an individual at the Lankershim
address. (Id. at ¶10 and Exh. 5.) 
 
Respondent argues that
Intervenor failed to perform any due diligence with respect to the AAA’s
address but does not explain why the burden falls to Intervenor to use an
address other than the one on file. Indeed, the notice of hearing clearly
demonstrates that the responsibility to maintain an updated address with
Intervenor lies with the parties to the hearing. Nor does the long gap between
the filing of the claim in 2017 and the ultimate hearing date in 2021 have any
bearing on the due process afforded Respondent in this action. As discussed
above, Intervenor utilized the address that was on file, and that was indicated
as unchanged with the Secretary of State as of the week prior to the hearing. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, Respondent
Raisa Petrowizky’s Amended Motion to Vacate Judgment is DENIED. 
 
 
Intervenor to give notice of this order.
