ANALYSIS:
 
On September 29, 2023, Plaintiff The North
River Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) initiated
this interpleader action against Defendants Timeless
Construction Group, Inc. (“Defendant Timeless”), Eduard Davuljyan (“Defendant
Davuljyan”), Laurence Hill (“Defendant Hill”), and Sam Malekan (“Defendant
Malekan”). 
 
Defendants
Davuljyan and Timeless filed an answer and cross-complaint for declaratory
relief and breach of contract on November 29, 2023. Plaintiff was dismissed
from the cross-complaint on January 8, 2024. Defendants Susan Moore (“Defendant
Moore”) and Trey Alexander (“Defendant Alexander”) were added to the action on
February 9, 2024. Proofs of service of the Summons and Complaint have been
filed with respect to Defendants Hill, Moore, and Alexander, who have yet to
file responsive pleadings. Defendant Malekan filed an answer on March 22, 2024.

 
The Complaint alleges that this action arises
from a dispute over Construction Bond No. Bond No. 04-CF605026 (the “Bond”) in
the penal sum of $25,000.00. (Compl., ¶8.) Defendant Davuljyan allegedly agreed to indemnify Plaintiff in exchange for
the issuance of the Bond pursuant to an
Application and Indemnity Agreement (“the Indemnity Agreement”). (Id. at
¶7 and Exh. 1.) The Bond was issued with Defendant Timeless named as the
principal. (Id. at ¶8.) After the Bond was issued, the remaining
Defendants made claims against the Bond. (Id. at ¶9.) Defendants
Davuljyan and Timeless are liable to Plaintiff
for its expenses, costs and attorney’s fees arising out of issuance of the Bond.
(Id. at ¶¶10-11.) 
 
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Deposit
Bond Funds, for Exoneration of Surety Bond, and for Award of Attorney’s Fees on March 14, 2024. Defendants Timeless and Davuljyan filed an opposition on May 15, 2024 and Plaintiff replied on May
20, 2024. 
 
Legal Standard
 
Interpleader is a procedure whereby a person holding money
or personal property to which conflicting claims are being made by others, or
may be made, can join the adverse claimants and force them to litigate their
claims among themselves. (Code Civ. Proc., § 386, subd. (b).) Hancock Oil
Co. v. Hopkins (1944) 24 Cal.2d 497, 508 (i.e., an escrow-holder who
receives conflicting demands from the parties to the escrow regarding the funds
or documents he or she holds); City of Morgan Hill v. Brown (1999) 71
Cal.App.4th 1114, 1122.)
 
Once the stakeholder’s right to interplead is established
and he or she deposits the money or personal property in court, he or she may
be discharged from liability to any of the claimants. This enables the
stakeholder to avoid multiplicity of actions, and the risk of inconsistent
results if each of the claimants were to sue him or her separately. (Cantu
v. Resolution Trust Corp. (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 857, 874; City of Morgan
Hill, supra, 71 Cal.App.4th at 1122.)
 
“An interpleader action is traditionally viewed as two
suits: one between the stakeholder and the claimants to determine the
stakeholder's right to interplead, and the other among the claimants to
determine who shall receive the funds interpleaded ... As against the
stakeholder, claimants may raise only matters which go to whether the suit is
properly one for interpleader; i.e., whether the elements of an interpleader
action are present.” (State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. Pietak (2001) 90
Cal.App.4th 600, 612.)
 
The stakeholder may seek reimbursement for its costs and
reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred.  
(UAP-Columbus JV 326132 v. Nesbitt (1991) 234
Cal.App.3d 1028, 1036.) The court may order payment thereof out of the funds
deposited by the stakeholder. (Ibid.) Ultimately, such payment may be
charged to one or more of the adverse claimants in the final judgment. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 386.6.) Finally, the Court may issue an “order restraining all
parties to the action from instituting or further prosecuting any other
proceeding in any court in this state affecting the rights and obligations as
between the parties to the interpleader until further order of the court.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 386, subd. (f).) 
 
Discussion
 
Substantively, Plaintiff contends that cannot determine the
validity of the conflicting demands that have been made on the construction
bond by Defendants Hill, Malekan, Moore, and Alexander. (Motion, Nail Decl.,
¶4.) In opposition, Defendants Timeless and Davuljyan
contend that no substantiated claims have been made on the Bond and that they
were unaware of Plaintiff’s intent to pay on the Bond. (Opp., Davuljyan Decl.,
¶¶27-29.) Defendants Timeless and Davuljyan also dispute the merits of the
purported claims against the Bond. (Id. at ¶¶28-29.) As pointed out in
Plaintiff’s reply, however, the interpleader process does not depend on the
merits of the claims against the disputed funds, or whether there has been a
determination of liability. (Code Civ. Proc., § 386, subd. (b).) Upon
deposit of the funds to the court, Plaintiff may be discharged from further
liability. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 386, 386.5.) 
 
Furthermore, Plaintiff is entitled to move to recover the
fees and costs expended bringing this interpleader action. (Code Civ. Proc., §
386.6, subd. (a).) Fees sought in the amount of $3,426.50 are substantiated by
Plaintiff’s attorney’s billing records and are reasonable in both rate and
number of hours billed. (Motion, Nail Decl., Exh. 3.) The costs of $1,092.00
are likewise supported in the billing statement. (Ibid.)
