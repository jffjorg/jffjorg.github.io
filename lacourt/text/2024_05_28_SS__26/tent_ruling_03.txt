THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE. BY JULY 2, 2024, PETITIONER IS TO FILE PROOF OF

REQUIREMENTS.
 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Petitioner Julie Oates (“Petitioner”) filed the instant
Petition for Release of Mechanic’s Lien against Respondent Hi-Tech Builders,
Inc. (“Respondent”) on December 28, 2023. No response to the Petition has been
filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
Petitioner moves to have the mechanic’s lien recorded
against their property by Respondent released. Under Civil Code section 8484
the petition for release order must be verified by the petitioner and allege
the following:
 
(a) The date of recordation of the
claim of lien. A certified copy of the claim of lien shall be attached to the
petition.
(b) The county in which the claim of
lien is recorded.
(c) The book and page or series number
of the place in the official records where the claim of lien is recorded.
(d) The legal description of the
property subject to the claim of lien.
(e) Whether an extension of credit has
been granted under Section 8460, if so to what date, and that the time for
commencement of an action to enforce the lien has expired.
(f) That the owner has given the
claimant notice under Section 8482 demanding that the claimant execute and
record a release of the lien and that the claimant is unable or unwilling to do
so or cannot with reasonable diligence be found.
(g) Whether an action to enforce the
lien is pending.
(h) Whether the owner of the property
or interest in the property has filed for relief in bankruptcy or there is
another restraint that prevents the claimant from commencing an action to
enforce the lien.
 
(Civil Code, § 8484.) The Petition contains all the required
information. However, Civil Code section 8486, subdivision (b) also requires
service of the Petition and Notice of Hearing to “be made in the same manner as
service of summons, or by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, return
receipt requested . . . .” (Civ. Code, § 8486, subd. (b).) Petitioner has not
filed a compliant proof of service of the Petition and the Notice of the
Hearing Date. The proof of service filed on January 17, 2024 purports to show
personal service of the papers on Defendant but only indicates delivery to the
receptionist at its office. (Proof of Service, 01/17/24, ¶3.) This does not
comply with the statute for service of process on a corporation. (See Code Civ.
Proc., § 416.10.) The Court cannot grant the Petition without compliance with
these statutory requirements.
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, Petitioner Julie
Oates’ Petition to Release Property from Mechanic’s Lien is CONTINUED TO JULY
30, 2024 AT 10:00 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE. BY JULY
2, 2024, PETITIONER IS TO FILE PROOF OF SERVICE OF THE PETITION AND NOTICE OF
HEARING IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS.
