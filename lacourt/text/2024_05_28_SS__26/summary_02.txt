And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court denies Respondent Raisa Petrowizky's Amended Motion to Vacate Judgment. Respondent argues that Intervenor failed to serve notice of the Labor Commissioner hearing to her correct address. However, Intervenor used the address on file and Respondent failed to update their address. The court finds that Respondent's long gap between the filing of the claim and the ultimate hearing date has no bearing on the due process afforded Respondent in this action. The court concludes that Respondent's Amended Motion to Vacate Judgment is denied.
