[1] The court also
notes Axos Bankâ€™s arguments regarding federal preemption raised for the first
time in its reply papers. (Reply, 2:1-6:12.) While new evidence and arguments
are generally not permitted in reply papers,
Plaintiff effectively waived that procedural violation by filing a sur-reply
responding to those issues. (See Jay v. Mahaffey (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 1522, 1537-1538; see also Guimei v.
General Electric Co. (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 689, 703-704 [consideration of
sur-reply within discretion of trial court].) Either way, the court declines
to address this argument since the FAC does not allege any facts showing that
Axos Bank is a federal savings bank implicating federal preemption under the
National Bank Act. (See SKF Farms v.
Superior Court, supra, 153 Cal.App.3d at p. 905 [demurrer limited to
allegations in complaint or facts subject to judicial notice].)
