Summary of the Tentative Ruling:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment filed by Defendant Harvey Deutsch, M.D. The Court finds that the Defendant has presented sufficient evidence to meet his initial burden of proof that Plaintiffs' causes of action against him lack merit. However, the Court also finds that the Plaintiffs have established a disputed issue of material fact as to breach of duty and causation by providing conflicting expert testimony. As a result, the motion for summary judgment is DENIED.
