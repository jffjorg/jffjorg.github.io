Background
            This

On April 20,
2022, plaintiffs Lillian Lloyd and David Lloyd, individually; as surviving
heirs, personal representatives, and successors in interest of decedent Mary
Lloyd; and as administrators and executors of the Estate of Mary Lloyd, filed a
Fourth Amended Complaint (“4AC”) against Providence Health System Southern
California dba Providence Holy Cross Medical Center; Kindred Hospital – Los
Angeles; THC – Orange County, LLC; Kindred Healthcare Operating, LLC; Douglas
Prisco, M.D.; Sarthi Shah, M.D.; Robin Gooding, R.N.; Jameel Hourani, M.D.;

replied on June 20, 2024.
 
Legal
Standard
The function of a motion for summary
judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing
party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an
order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) In
analyzing motions for summary judgment, courts must apply a three-step
analysis: “(1) identify the issues framed by the pleadings; (2) determine
whether the moving party has negated the opponent's claims; and (3) determine
whether the opposition has demonstrated the existence of a triable, material
factual issue.” (Hinesley v. Oakshade
Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.)
            As
to each claim as framed by the complaint, the defendant moving for summary
judgment must satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to negate
an essential element, or to establish a defense. (Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.)
Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing
summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that
party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006)
39 Cal.4th 384, 389.) A motion for summary judgment must be denied where the
moving party's evidence does not prove all material facts, even in the absence
of any opposition (Leyva v. Sup. Ct. (1985)
164 Cal.App.3d 462, 475) or where the opposition is weak (Salesguevara v. Wyeth Labs., Inc. (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 379, 384,
387).
 
Discussion
Defendant’s evidentiary
objections to the Declaration of Dr. Bain are OVERRULED.
Defendant Duetsch
moves for summary judgment with respect to the Fourth Amended Complaint. Defendant contends that there was no breach
of the standard of care and no act on the part of Duetsch that caused or
contributed to the injuries based on the Declaration of Martin O’Toole, M.D.,
F.A.C.S. 
            “[I]n ‘ “any medical malpractice action, the plaintiff must establish:
‘(1) the duty of the professional to use such skill, prudence, and diligence as
other members of his profession commonly possess and exercise; (2) a breach of
that duty; (3) a proximate causal connection between the negligent conduct and
the resulting injury; and (4) actual loss or damage resulting from the
professional's negligence.’ [Citation.]” ’ [Citation.]” (Powell v. Kleinman
(2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 112, 122.)
            The Court finds that Defendant
presents sufficient evidence to meet his initial burden of proof that
Plaintiffs’ causes of action against him lack merit. Defendant provides the
declaration of his expert witness, Martin O’Toole, M.D., F.A.C.S., who opines
that the wound care provided to Plaintiff by Deutsch at Kindred Hospital – Los Angeles
from February 25, 2019 through April 19, 2019, was appropriate and at all times
complied with the standard of care required in February – April 2019, based
upon his review of Lloyd’s medical records and his education, training and
experience as a plastic surgeon. (O’Toole Decl., ¶¶6-13; Gonalez Decl., ¶7, Exh.
F.) Further, Dr. O’Toole opines that to a reasonable degree of medical
probability, that there was no act or omission on the part of Deutsch that
caused or contributed to Plaintiff's injuries. (O’Toole Decl., ¶14.) He states
that based upon his education, training and experience, as well as his review
of the relevant materials, there was nothing Deutsch did, or failed to do, that
caused Plaintiff's injuries. (Ibid.) Accordingly, this evidence is sufficient
to show that Plaintiffs’ causes of action against Defendant lack merit. The
evidence shows Defendant met the applicable standard of care and that no
causation existed between Defendant’s acts or omissions and the claimed
injuries, including Decedent’s death. The burden now shifts to Plaintiffs to
show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to their
causes of action against Defendant. (CCP § 437c(p)(2).)
            In opposition, Plaintiffs provide
the declaration of their own expert witness, Dr. Michael A. Bain, M.D., MSS,
who opines that to a reasonable degree of medical probability, that as the
Kindred physician responsible for the surgical care of Ms. Lloyd’s Hospital
Acquired Pressure Injuries, Deutsch did not exercise or use the skill, care,
and knowledge that a reasonably careful surgeon would have taken with Ms.
Lloyd. Based upon his review of the materials in this case, and based upon his
education, training and experience as a plastic surgeon, the wound care
provided to Ms. Lloyd by Deutsch from February 27 through April 24, 2019, was
inappropriate and at all times failed to comply with the requisite standard of
care. (Bain Decl., ¶38.) Further, Dr. Bain opines that Deutsch caused or
contributed to Decedent’s injuries and death based on a number of acts. (Bain
Decl., ¶¶40a.-40p.) In reply, Deutsch argues that Dr. Bain makes improper
conclusions as to Deutsch’s state of mind, however Deutsch’s state of mind and
any conclusions made are immaterial to this ruling. 
            Based on the evidence presented, the
Court finds that Plaintiff has established a disputed issue of material fact as
to breach of duty and causation by providing conflicting expert testimony.
 
Based on the foregoing, the motion is DENIED.
 
It is so
ordered.
