Background
            Plaintiff
Ruth Ann Isaacs Hamilton (Plaintiff) filed this action on July 31, 2023,
against defendants Axos Bank, S& L (Axos Bank), 4505 Santa Rosalia Lender
LLC (4505) (collectively, Defendants), and Does 1 through 100, alleging causes
of action for (1) Violation of California Civil Code sections 1671 et seq.; (2)
Elder Abuse (Elder Adult and Dependent Adult Civil Protection Act – Welf. &
Inst. Code §§ 15600, et seq.); (3) Negligence; (4) Negligent Infliction of
Emotional Distress; (5) Conversion; (6) Unfair Competition; and (7) Breach of
Contract. On December 11, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended
Complaint (FAC) against the same Defendants, alleging causes of action for (1)
Violation of California Civil Code section 1671; (2) Elder Abuse (Elder Adult
and Dependent Adult Civil Protection Act – Welf. & Inst. Code §§ 15600, et
seq.); (3) Conversion; (4) Unfair Competition; (5) Breach of Contract; and (6)
Violation of Cal. Penal Code § 496. This dispute arises out of Defendants’
alleged misconduct in connection with a certain loan agreement and real
property. (FAC, ¶¶ 1-4.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendants improperly assessed
Plaintiff for late charges, default judgment interest rates, and other
penalties in connection with the subject loan agreement. (Id., at ¶¶ 17-20.)
            On
January 25, 2024, Axos Bank demurred to and moved to strike the FAC. On February
20, 2024, Plaintiff opposed the demurrer and motion to strike. On February 26,
2024, Axos Bank replied to both oppositions. On June 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed
a sur-reply.
 
Legal
Standard – Axos Bank’s Demurrer to the First Amended Complaint
When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. (Taylor v. City of Los
Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228 (Taylor).)
“A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic
matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of
the pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) “The
only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it
stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.” (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
 
Discussion
– Axos Bank’s Demurrer to the First Amended Complaint
            Request for Judicial Notice
            The court DENIES Axos Bank’s request
for judicial notice, as the court does not rely on that document in reaching
its decision herein.
            
Meet and Confer – Axos Bank’s Demurrer to the First Amended Complaint
            Per Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41,
subdivision (a), the parties are required to meet and confer in person, by
telephone, or by video conference before filing a demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41, subd. (a).) Axos Bank indicates having met and conferred with Plaintiff
by telephone, but the parties were unable to resolve the issues raised. (Fink
Decl., ¶¶ 3-4.) The court finds this sufficient.
 
Defendant Axos Bank’s Demurrer to the First Amended
Complaint
Defendant Axos
Bank demurs to the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of
action in the FAC on the grounds that they fail to state a cause of action. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).)
 
First
Cause of Action – Violation of California Civil Code section 1671
Axos Bank contends
the first cause of action fails because the FAC fails to plead any facts to
establish that the 18% default interest rate was unreasonable under the
circumstances existing at the time the contract was made.[1]
“[A] provision in a contract liquidating
the damages for the breach of the contract is valid unless the party seeking to
invalidate the provision establishes that the provision was unreasonable under
the circumstances existing at the time the contract was made.” (Civ. Code, §
1671, subd. (b).)
Here, the FAC
alleges that Axos Bank improperly charged Plaintiff an 18% default interest
rate on the subject loan agreement following an initial default in December
2021. (FAC, ¶ 21.) The FAC alleges that Plaintiff received a demand statement
on May 20, 2022, itemizing the amount required to reinstate the loan, which
included the 18% default interest rate and additional charges of approximately
$12,558.37, which bore no reasonable relationship to the actual damages
resulting from the default. (FAC, ¶ 25.) The FAC alleges that even after
Plaintiff reinstated the loan, Axos Bank again shortly thereafter reinstated
the 18% default interest rate. (FAC, ¶ 30.)
The court finds that the FAC alleges
sufficient facts to state a claim for violation of Civil Code section 1671,
subdivision (b). The Court of Appeal in Honchariw v. FJM Private Mortgage
Fund, LLC (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 893 held that a default interest charge imposed
against the entire unpaid principal loan balance following a single default
constituted an unlawful penalty. (Id., at p. 906.) The FAC appears to
allege a similar type of charge here. (See FAC, ¶¶ 2-3, 24, 41, 67.) The court
does find that the FAC is not entirely clear as to whether the default interest
was allegedly charged against the entire unpaid principal balance, but at the
pleading stage, the court liberally construes ambiguous allegations in favor of
Plaintiff. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 452 [“In the construction of a pleading, for
the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations must be liberally
construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.”]; Taylor,
supra, 144 Cal.App.4th at p. 1228.)
The court
therefore OVERRULES Axos Bank’s demurrer to the first cause of action.
 
Second
Cause of Action – Elder Abuse
Axos Bank contends the FAC fails to state
sufficient facts for an elder abuse claim because it alleges that Plaintiff did
not turn 65 until January 30, 2023 and that Axos Bank transferred all of its
interest in the loan to Defendant 4505 less than two months later, having no
further involvement with the loan. Axos Bank contends the FAC does not allege
Axos Bank engaged in any acts constituting financial elder abuse between
January 30, 2023 and March 21, 2023, and otherwise fails to allege facts with
the requisite specificity. Axos Bank contends it is not a violation to sell the
loan, and the FAC alleges Axos Bank had the discretion as to how it would use
the $90,000 reserve. Axos Bank also contends financial elder abuse in the
banking context is limited to transactions that the bank actually knew were
assisting the customer in committing a specific tort, and that Plaintiff does
not contend she actually paid the allegedly improper charges.
Financial elder abuse occurs when a person
takes the property of an elder for a wrongful use or with intent to defraud or
by undue influence. (See Welf. & Inst. Code, § 15610.30, subd. (a).) A
person is deemed to have taken the property when he or she has deprived an
elder of any property right. (See Id., § 15610.30(c).) Although bad
faith or intent to defraud is no longer required, wrongful use of property must
still be alleged. (Stebley v. Litton Loan Servicing, LLP (2011) 202
Cal.App.4th 522, 527-28.) “A person . . . shall be deemed to have taken . . .
property for a wrongful use if . . . the person . . . takes . . . the property
and the person . . . knew or should have known that this conduct is likely to
be harmful to the elder . . . .” (Id., § 15610.30, subd. (b).) Elder
abuse claims are statutory causes of action and therefore must be pleaded with
particularity. (See Covenant Care, Inc. v. Superior Court (2004) 32
Cal.4th 771, 790, citing Lopez v. Southern Cal. Rapid Trans. Dist.
(1985) 40 Cal.3d 780, 795.)
Here, the FAC
alleges that Plaintiff turned 65 years old on January 30, 2023. (FAC, ¶ 35.)
The FAC alleges that Axos Bank continued to improperly assess the allegedly
illegal default interest charges against Plaintiff in February and March 2023.
(FAC, ¶ 36.) The FAC then alleges that Plaintiff paid off all of these
allegedly improper default interest charges, and other penalties and late
charges, in April 2023. (FAC, ¶ 39.) The court finds these allegations
sufficient to allege that Axos Bank knew or should have known its actions would
likely harm Plaintiff and therefore states a cause of action for financial
elder abuse.
The court
therefore OVERRULES Defendant 4505’s demurrer to the second cause of action.
 
Third Cause of Action – Conversion
Axos Bank contends the third cause of
action for conversion fails to state a claim because conversion claims cannot
be based on money unless a specific, identifiable sums is involved, and even
then, requires allegations of the plaintiff’s ownership or right of possession.
Axos Bank contends that to the extent Plaintiff paid any money to Axos Bank,
she did so intentionally so, and cannot make a conversion claim based on having
been allegedly overcharged. Axos Bank contends Plaintiff made these payments
per the loan agreement, and no court has ever declared such a default interest
payment an unlawful penalty.
“’A cause of action for conversion
requires allegations of plaintiff's ownership or right to possession of
property; defendant's wrongful act toward or disposition of the property,
interfering with plaintiff's possession; and damage to plaintiff. [Citation.]
Money cannot be the subject of a cause of action for conversion unless there is
a specific, identifiable sum involved, such as where an agent accepts a sum of
money to be paid to another and fails to make the payment.’ [Citation.]” (PCO, Inc. v. Christensen, Miller, Fink, Jacobs, Glaser, Weil &
Shapiro, LLP (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 384, 395.)
Here, the FAC alleges that Defendants took
Plaintiff’s money by imposing an illegal default interest rate and other
improper charges, which she paid to avoid foreclosure on her property. (FAC, ¶¶
20-40.) The FAC also alleges a specific identifiable sum of $237,038.59. (FAC,
¶ 67.) The court further finds Axos Bank’s citation to McKell v. Washington
Mutual, Inc. (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1457 to be unavailing, as the FAC does
not allege Plaintiff was being overcharged, but instead that she was being
charged illegally. (See Id., at pp. 1491-1492; FAC, ¶¶ 21-40.) The court
finds FAC alleges sufficient facts to state a cause of action for conversion.
The court therefore OVERRULES the demurrer
to the third cause of action.
 
            Fourth Cause of Action – Unfair
Competition
            Axos Bank contends the FAC fails to
state a cause of action for unfair competition because it fails to allege
unfair, fraudulent, or unlawful business practices. Axos Bank contends the
default interest provision was not illegal or invalid and was clearly disclosed
in the loan documents Plaintiff signed. Axos Bank contends Plaintiff cannot
allege any consumer injury since this was a business loan and Plaintiff did not
allege any conduct that could be found to significantly threaten or harm
competition. Axos Bank further contends there are no allegations that any
statements were disseminated to the public upon which reasonable consumers were
likely to be decided or any fraudulent misrepresentations in the loan
documents, which clearly disclosed the default interest provision at issue.
Axos Bank also contends it is not vicariously liable for any violations of
Business and Professions Code section 17200.
“As used in this chapter, unfair
competition shall mean and include any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business
act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising and any
act prohibited by Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 17500) of Part 3 of
Division 7 of the Business and Professions Code.” Bus. & Prof. Code, §
17200. “The UCL prohibits any unfair, unlawful, or fraudulent business act or
practice. [Citation.] Only the first two types of practices are at issue here.
A practice is unlawful under the UCL where it violates a predicate law.” (CADC/RADC
Venture 2011-1 LLC v. Bradley (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 775, 792-793.) “An
‘unlawful’ business practice or act within the meaning of the UCL ‘is an act or
practice, committed pursuant to business activity, that is at the same time
forbidden by law. [Citation.]” Bernardo v. Planned Parenthood Fed'n of Am.
(2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 322, 351 (Bernardo), italics in original.)
Here, the FAC alleges that Defendants
charged Plaintiff illegal default interest rates, imposed other improper
charges under the loan, and otherwise forced Plaintiff to incur various
expenses to avoid foreclosure of her real property. (FAC, ¶¶ 21-40.) The FAC
alleges predicate laws such as Civil Code section 1671 for liquidated damages and
Welfare and Institutions Code section 15610.30, subdivision (a), for financial
elder abuse. (FAC, ¶¶ 42-64.) Whether these actions constituted unfair or
fraudulent business practices is a question of fact revolving around the
question of whether the public is likely to be deceived. (Daro v. Superior Ct. (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 1079, 1099
fn. 9.) The court finds the FAC alleges sufficient facts demonstrating unlawful,
unfair, or fraudulent business practices for purposes of an unfair competition
claim.
The court therefore OVERRULES the demurrer
to the fourth cause of action.
 
Fifth Cause of Action – Breach of Contract
Axos Bank demurs to the fifth cause of
action for breach of contract on the grounds that it fails to state a cause of
action. Axos Bank contends the FAC does not identify any provision of the loan
which it has breached. Axos Bank contends the thrust of this action is that the
loan includes a provision allowing Axos Bank to charge default interest,
purportedly in violation of Civil Code section 1671, subdivision (b). Axos Bank
also contends this claim cannot be based on the holding back of the $90,000
reserve since the FAC alleges that the disposition of that money is within Axos
Bank’s sole discretion. Axos Bank further contends that any arguments based on
the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing also fail because it does not
impose duties beyond the terms of the contract and cannot contradict the
express terms of the contract.
The elements of a cause of action for
breach of contract are, “’(1) the existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff's
performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant's breach, and (4) the
resulting damages to the plaintiff.’ [Citations.]” (D'Arrigo
Bros. of California v. United Farmworkers of Am. (2014) 224
Cal.App.4th 790, 800.)
Here, the FAC alleges breach of contract
against Defendants based on their alleged improper enforcement of the loan,
namely, the improper charges and amounts collected thereunder. (FAC, ¶ 75.) The
court finds this insufficient to state a cause of action for breach of contract.
The FAC contains no allegations indicating that Defendants failed to perform as
promised. Instead, the FAC alleges that Defendants enforced illegal provisions
of the loan. (See FAC, ¶¶ 74-79.) Moreover, although not directly addressed by
the parties’ respective briefs, the court notes that if these terms are illegal
as Plaintiff alleges, then they are not enforceable. (Agam v. Gavra (2015)
236 Cal.App.4th 91, 112 [“[I]llegal contracts are not enforceable.”])
The court further agrees with Axos Bank
that the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing cannot be used to
contradict the express terms of the contract. (See Storek & Storek, Inc.
v. Citicorp Real Estate, Inc. (1992) 100 Cal.App.4th, 44, 55.) If the loan
provides Axos Bank the right to charge the disputed default interest rate, the
implied duty of good faith and fair dealing cannot require a different result. 
The court therefore SUSTAINS the demurrer
to the fifth cause of action, with 20 days’ leave to amend.
 
            Sixth Cause of Action – Violation
of Penal Code § 496
            Axos Bank demurs to the sixth cause
of action on the grounds that it fails to state a cause of action. Axos Bank
contends this cause of action fails because the charging of money per the terms
of the contract is not a theft under Penal Code section 496, subdivision (c).
Axos Bank contends the interest and fees could not have been stolen since they
were part of the terms of the loan, especially since Plaintiff paid those funds
to Axos Bank. Axos Bank therefore could not have known those funds were stolen.
“The language of section 496(c) is clear
and unambiguous. A criminal conviction is not a prerequisite to recovery of
treble damages. All that is required for civil liability to attach under
section 496(c), including entitlement to treble damages, is that a ‘violation’
of subdivision (a) or (b) of section 496 is found to have occurred. A violation
may be found to have occurred if the person engaged in the conduct described in
the statute. While section 496(a) covers a spectrum of impermissible activity
relating to stolen property, the elements required to show a violation of
section 496(a) are simply that (i) property was stolen or obtained in a manner
constituting theft, (ii) the defendant knew the property was so stolen or
obtained, and (iii) the defendant received or had possession of the stolen
property.” (Switzer v. Wood, supra, 35 Cal.App.5th 116, 126 (Switzer),
internal citations omitted.)
            Here, the FAC alleges that Axos
Bank’s wrongful charges under the loan constitute theft for purposes of Penal
Code section 496. (FAC, ¶ 81.) The court finds this insufficient. The FAC
contains no allegations indicating that Axos Bank stole Plaintiff’s money from
her. It is one thing to allege that the loan agreement contains illegal
provisions, but that does not necessarily equate to theft, and Plaintiff
provided no authority showing that enforcement of an illegal loan agreement equates
to theft for purposes of Penal Code section 496. The Switzer case
involved an LLC member who took large sums of money belonging to the plaintiff
and/or to the LLC, such as selling inventory and keeping the profits to himself.
(Switzer, supra, 35 Cal.App.5th at p. 126.) This case is simply a
dispute over the terms of the loan agreement.
            The court therefore SUSTAINS the
demurrer to the sixth cause of action, with 20 days’ leave to amend.
            
Legal
Standard – Axos Bank’s Motion to Strike Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint
“Any party, within
the time allowed to respond to a pleading may serve and file a notice of motion
to strike the whole or any part thereof, but this time limitation shall not apply to
motions specified in subdivision (e).” (Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd.
(b)(2).) “The court may, upon a motion made pursuant to Section 435, or at any
time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper: (a) Strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading. (b) Strike out all or any
part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of
this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.” (Id., § 436.)
 
Discussion
– Axos Bank’s Motion to Strike Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint
Meet and Confer – Axos Bank’s Motion to Strike the First Amended
Complaint
            Per Code of Civil Procedure section 435.5, subdivision
(a), the parties are required to meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by
video conference before filing a motion to strike. (Code Civ. Proc., § 435.5,
subd. (a).) The court notes that Defendant 4505 submitted Judicial Council Form
CIV-140, i.e., Declaration of Demurring or Moving Party Regarding Meet and
Confer, which indicates that 4505 was unsuccessful in getting Plaintiff to meet
and confer in good faith. (Milligan Decl., ¶ 2, subd. (b).) The court finds
this sufficient.
 
            Axos Bank’s Motion to Strike the First Amended
Complaint
            Penalties Under Civil Code Section 1671
            Axos Bank contends that Civil Code
section 1671, subdivision (b), does not provide for a damages remedy, and that
paragraph 47 of the FAC should therefore be stricken.
“[T]he common law as
codified by section 1671, subdivision (d), permits a consumer to seek monetary
relief, both offensively and defensively, from liquidated damages.” (Beasley v. Wells Fargo Bank (1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1383,
1400-1401 (Beasley).)
            Here, Axos Bank’s argument is
directly contradicted by Beasley. Additionally, given the court
overruling the demurrer to the first cause of action, the FAC has alleged
sufficient facts to support this request for damages. (See FAC, ¶¶ 42-47.)
            The court therefore DENIES the
motion to strike as to paragraph 47 of the FAC.
 
Punitive Damages
            A claim for
punitive damages is subject to a motion to strike when the allegations fail to
rise to the level of malice, oppression, or fraud necessary under Civil Code
section 3294. (Turman v. Turning Point of Central California, Inc.
(2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 53, 64.) “There
is no question that punitive damages may be recovered in an action for
conversion. [Citations.] Punitive damages are recoverable, however, only upon a
showing of malice, fraud or oppression.” (Krusi v. Bear, Stearns &
Co. (1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 664, 678.) Punitive damages are also
available for elder abuse claims. (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 15657.5, subd.
(d).)
Given the court
overruling the demurrer to the second cause of action for elder abuse and third
cause of action for conversion, the court finds the FAC alleges a basis for
seeking punitive damages and that it alleges sufficient facts for punitive
damages at the pleading stage. (See FAC, ¶¶ 48-68; Civ. Code, § 3294, subd.
(b)(2) [“’Oppression’
means despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in
conscious disregard of that person's rights.”])
 The court therefore DENIES the
motion to strike with respect to paragraphs 63 and 68 of the FAC, and with
respect to the prayer for punitive damages on page 16, paragraph 3, of the FAC.
 
 
Attorney’s Fees
Axos Bank contends Plaintiff has not pled any basis for a right to
attorney’s fees.
Attorney’s fees are available in financial elder abuse actions. (Welf. & Inst.
Code, § 15657.5, subd. (b).)
Here, Axos Bank’s argument is directly
contradicted by Welfare and Institutions Code section 15657.5, subdivision (b).
Also, given the court overruling the demurrer as to the second cause of action
for elder abuse, the court finds the FAC alleges sufficient facts to state a basis
for requesting attorney’s fees.
The court therefore DENIES the motion to
strike with respect to paragraph 4 of the prayer for relief on page 16 of the
FAC.
 
Treble Damages
Axos Bank contends treble damages are
unavailable under Civil Code section 3345 because no penalty is involved. Axos
Bank also contends treble damages are unavailable under Penal Code section 496 unless
there has been theft.
The court also finds Axos Bank’s argument
regarding no penalty being involved does not make sense, since Civil Code
section 3345 expressly provides for treble damages in cases involving financial
elder abuse, which is what Plaintiff’s claim is here. (Civ. Code, § 3345, subd.
(b).) Moreover, given the court overruling the demurrer to the second cause of
action for financial elder abuse, the court finds the FAC alleges a sufficient
basis for treble damages. (See FAC, ¶¶ 48-64; Civ. Code, § 3345.) 
With respect to the sixth cause of action for
violation of Penal Code section 496, given the court’s sustaining of the
demurrer to that cause of action, the court finds the FAC fails to allege
sufficient facts to support a request for treble damages under Penal Code
section 496. (See Pen. Code, § 496.)
The court therefore DENIES the motion to
strike with respect to paragraph 64 of the FAC, and with respect to the prayer
for treble damages on page 16, paragraph 5, of the FAC. The court GRANTS the
motion to strike with respect paragraph 83 of the FAC, and with respect to the
prayer for treble damages on page 16, paragraph 6, of the FAC, with 20
days’ leave to amend.
 
It is so
ordered.
