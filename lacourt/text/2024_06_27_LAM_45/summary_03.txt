And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses Axos Bank's argument regarding federal preemption, which was raised for the first time in its reply papers. The court notes that while new evidence and arguments are generally not permitted in reply papers, the plaintiff effectively waived this procedural violation by filing a sur-reply responding to those issues. However, the court declines to address this argument since the facial allegation (FAC) does not allege any facts showing that Axos Bank is a federal savings bank implicating federal preemption under the National Bank Act.
