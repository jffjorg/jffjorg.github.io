[TENTATIVE]

   AND FOR SANCTIONS AGAINST DEFENDANT ABEGAIL ALMA COOK

Plaintiff EBF Holdings, LLC dba Everest
Business Funding (“Plaintiff”) moves for an order deeming admitted the
genuineness of documents and truth of matters specified in its First Set of Requests
for Admission served on defendant Abegail Alma Cook (“Defendant”) on October
16, 2023. The motion is unopposed. 
Where a party fails to timely respond
to a request for admission, the propounding party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) The
court shall grant a motion to deem admitted requests for admissions, “unless it
finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) Where
a party fails to provide a timely response to requests for admission, “[i]t is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this
motion.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (c).)
          The motion is
unopposed and there is no dispute that Defendant failed to serve responses to
Plaintiff’s discovery requests. It also does not appear that Defendant has
served substantially compliant proposed responses. Accordingly, the motion is
GRANTED. 
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions in
the amount of $2,015 for this simple motion (and a pending motion against co-defendant
Corinthian Hospice, Inc.) is excessive. Plaintiff’s counsel, who charges a
billing rate of $650 per hour, should have been able to draft these two relatively
simple motions in less than 3.1 hours. Accordingly, sanctions are imposed
against Defendant in the reduced amount of $385, consisting of 0.5 hours at
Plaintiff’s counsel’s hourly rate and a $60 filing fee, payable within 20 days
of the date of this Order. 
Moving party to give notice.

this 8th
day of July 2024
