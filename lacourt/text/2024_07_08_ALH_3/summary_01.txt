Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion by Eastern Horizon, LLC (the defendant) to compel further responses to requests for production of documents from plaintiff Pauline Yip. The motion concerns two specific requests: (1) all federal and state income tax filings for the years 2010 to 2021, and (2) all bank statements from January 1, 2020, to the present.

The judge denies the motion as to both requests, finding that they are overbroad. The judge notes that Eastern Horizon fails to explain why 11 years of tax returns are necessary, and that the requested bank statements are not relevant to the merits of Yip's quiet title claim.

The judge also denies both parties' requests for sanctions. The case is set for hearing on July 8, 2024, and parties who intend to submit on the tentative must send an email to the court indicating their intention to do so.
