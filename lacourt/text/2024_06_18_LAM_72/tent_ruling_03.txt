 Hearing Date:  June 18, 2024
 Calendar Number:  4



 
 
 
Petitioner and Plaintiff Reina De Leon (“Petitioner”) seeks
the approval of the compromise of the claims of Plaintiffs Estrella Rebeca Leja
De Leon (“Estrella”), Lucas Julian Leja De Leon (“Lucas”), and Juan Alejandro
Abdias Leja De Leon (“Juan”) (collectively, the “Minor Plaintiffs”) (the Court
uses first names for clarity only, and means no disrespect).
 
The Court GRANTS each of the three petitions.
 
Background
 
            This
is a landlord-tenant case. Petitioner, Estrella, Lucas, Juan, and Rudy Lucas
Leja Tzic (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) are residential tenants at 447 S.
Rampart Boulevard Los Angeles, California 90057, a multi-family apartment
building (the “Property”). Plaintiffs live in Unit 305 of the property pursuant
to a lease agreement. Defendants are the owners and managers of the Property.
 
            Plaintiffs
allege a number of defects in the Property that Defendants failed to fix,
including insect and rodent infestations, defective flooring, general
dilapidation, failure to maintain the windows and plumbing, and lack of
required electrical lighting.
 
            Plaintiffs
filed this action on March 23, 2023, raising claims for (1) breach of warranty
of habitability; (2) breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment; (3) negligence; and
(4) breach of contract.
 
            Petitioner
filed each of these three petitions on May 7, 2024. No party has filed an
opposition.
 
Legal Standard
 
Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 372,
any settlement of a claim made by a minor or adult with a disability must be
approved by the court. If the court is satisfied that the settlement is in
the best interest of the claimant, then the court shall approve the
settlement. (See Pearson v. Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th
1333, 1338.)   
 
A petition for court approval of a compromise or covenant
not to sue under Code of Civil Procedure section 372 must comply with
California Rules of Court, Rules 7.950, 7.951, and 7.952. The petition must be
verified by the petitioner and contain a full disclosure of all information
that has “any bearing upon the reasonableness” of the compromise or the
covenant. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 7.950.)  The person compromising
the claim on behalf of the minor or person who lacks capacity, and the
represented person, must attend the hearing on compromise of the claim unless
the court for good cause dispenses with their personal appearance. (Cal. Rules
of Court, Rule 7.952.)   
 
Discussion
 
            No
party objects to the settlement here.
 
The gross settlement value is $90,000. Each of the adult
Plaintiffs – Petitioner and Tzic – will receive $37,500.00. Each of the Minor
Plaintiffs will receive $5,000.00. No portion of the Minor Plaintiffs’
settlements is allocated to medical expenses. The adult Plaintiffs are being
allocated the majority of damages for the cost of rent paid during the period
in which the Property was allegedly uninhabitable.
 
Petitioner requests approval of $1,250.00 in attorney’s fees
and $327.89 in costs to be taken from each Minor Plaintiff’s settlement,
leaving each Minor Plaintiff with $3,422.11. The attorney fee represents a
contingency fee of 25%. The Court finds these fees and costs to be reasonable.
 
            The
Court finds that these settlements are in the best interests of each of the
Minor Plaintiffs. The Court therefore grants each of the three petitions.
