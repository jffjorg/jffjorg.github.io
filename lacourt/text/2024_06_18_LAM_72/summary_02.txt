In taking an unfair advantage of another's weakness of mind; or, 3. In taking a grossly oppressive and unfair advantage of another's necessities or distress." (Civil Code, section 1575)
  - "There are no fixed definitions or inflexible formulas. Rather, [courts] are concerned with whether from the entire context it appears that one's will was overborne and he was induced to do or forbear to do an act which he would not do, or would do, if left to act freely." (Keithley v. Civil Service Bd. (1970) 11 Cal.App.3d 443, 451)
```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants the Rigas Defendants' motion for summary judgment. The Court finds that all of the claims in this case are covered by the general release in the December Agreements. The Court concludes that Hooper was not coerced into signing the December Agreements by Rigas, but rather by his wife. The Court also finds that Hooper had alternative options (e.g., negotiating, consulting an attorney) but chose not to exercise them. The Court holds that the releases in the December Agreements are enforceable. The Court also rejects the Plaintiffs' claims for breach of fiduciary duty by attorney, finding that Rigas did not exert undue influence on Hooper. Finally, the Court holds that CEH is bound by the general release in the December Agreements because CEH is an alter ego of Hooper and UW.
