Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The court has denied the plaintiff's motion to amend the default judgment to include Guiyong Park as a judgment debtor. The court finds that Park had substantial control over the litigation, but the plaintiff has not made a sufficient showing that Park is the alter ego of R2B AutoBank Corp. The court notes that Labor Code, section 558.1 may provide a basis for extending liability to Park if he "violated or caused to be violated" the labor laws in question. However, the court finds that section 558.1 does not facially provide a basis for finding that Park is R2B AutoBank Corp.'s alter ego. The court therefore denies the motion without prejudice.
