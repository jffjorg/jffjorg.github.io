Summary:

Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion for preservation of evidence filed by Plaintiff Wendy Viridiana Solano-Castro. The motion sought to require all parties and entities served with the order to preserve all product supply records and other relevant records related to the case. The court found that the motion lacks a basis of authority for the requested relief and that the scope of the requested information is too broad. The court also found that the motion fails to satisfy the elements for injunctive relief, including probability of success on the merits, irreparable harm, and balance of equities. The court notes that the requested relief is overly broad and unwieldy, and that the burden of sorting and collating the files would be prohibitively heavy. The court orders the plaintiff to give notice of the ruling.
