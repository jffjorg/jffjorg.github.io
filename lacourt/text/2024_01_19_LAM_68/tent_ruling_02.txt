PRESERVATION OF EVIDENCE
 
MOVING

RESPONDING
PARTY: Defendant, Walker & Zanger, LLC
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED
Motion
for Preservation of Evidence
 
SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Wendy
Viridinia Solano-Castro, et al. alleges the wrongful death of Raul Garcia-Leon
caused from as a stone fabricator and installer. Plaintiffs contend working
with “toxic” stone products led to the development of silicosis and death of
Garcia-Leon on February 16, 2023.
 
On
May 22, 2023, Plaintiff filed a 582 paragraph complaint for negligence, strict
liability – warning defect, strict liability – design defect, fraudulent
concealment, and breach of implied warranties. The complaint names a multitude
of parties comprised of suppliers, sellers, etc. The case was deemed
non-complex on June 5, 2023, and assigned to Department 68 on June 7, 2023. 
 
On
October 11, 2023, the court sustained the demurrer of MS International, Inc. to
the fourth cause of action with 20 days leave to amend. On November 2, 2023,
Caesarstone USA, Inc. filed a cross-complaint for indemnity, declaratory relief
and apportionment. On December 29, 2023, Lowes Home Centers, LLC filed a
cross-complaint indemnity, declaratory relief and apportionment.
 
RULING: Denied
Evidentiary Objections: Overruled/Not Ruled Upon (not relied
upon for ruling on the motion)
 
Plaintiff Wendy Viridiana Solano-Claustro moves for the preservation
of evidence “requiring all parties and all other persons and entities served
with the order [] to preserve all product supply records, i.e., all records
regarding the sale, distribution, supply, delivery, and/or receipt of all stone
slabs, as well as other records that are relevant to this case.” Numerous
defendants filed oppositions, including Imperial Tile & Stone, Dal-Tile
Distribution, Inc., Cambria Company, LLC, and Walker & Zanger, LLC, with
joinders and, some with limited additional points and authorities from Lowe’s
Home Centers, LLC, EIDP, Inc., and C & C North America, Inc.
 
Defendants collectively challenge both the legal and factual
foundation for the requested relief. All challenging the broad and general
scope of requested information, especially for major retail outlets like Lowe’s
who denies maintaining any stone products in inventory or any contractual
relationship with stone fabricators employing Garcia-Leon; a lack of
jurisdiction over certain defendants and proof of any violation of an
obligation to preserve evidence; lack of authority in support of the motion, an
improper preliminary injunction without support; improperly seeking to enjoin
unnamed/unserved parties; and, evidentiary objections.
 
Plaintiff in reply reiterates the foundation for the
preservation motion, and the lack of any “adequate” alternative remedy under
spoliation of evidence authority. Plaintiff denies the request is burdensome or
overbroad, or constitutes a mandatory injunction. Plaintiff finally maintains a
right to a preservation order over non-served/unidentified third parties.
 
As quoted above, the motion broadly requests all records
without time or product limitations on the 16 served parties, and potentially
unidentified future parties and third parties. The court declines to consider
any order against unnamed or unserved named or potentially substituted parties.
The motion lacks a basis of authority for the court to impose such relief. 
 
The motion itself relies on general citation to the plenary
powers of the court itself, as well as service of process rules, authority for
ex parte applications, and repealed statutes and Los Angeles Superior Court
Appellate Division section rules (See Code Civ. Proc. § 117, LASC §§ 9.36 and
9.37). Of the limited case authority on the subject, all parties address the
relevant authority.
 
While pre-lawsuit methods for preservation of
evidence exist (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2035.010, 2035.030), courts considering the
question find no specific basis of authority for a requirement of preservation
of evidence other than a functionally equivalent preliminary injunction in the
form of a protective order, or reliance on spoliation rules following any
alleged destruction of evidence. (Dodge,
Warren & Peters Ins. Services, Inc. v. Riley (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 1414, 1419 accord Northpoint Homeowners Assn v. Superior Court (1979) 95 Cal.App.3d 241, 244-246; see San Francisco Unified School Dist. ex rel. Contreras v. First
Student, Inc. (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 1212,
1227 (footnote 10); Cedars-Sinai Med. Ctr. v. Superior Court (1998) 18
Cal.4th 1, 17-18; New Albertsons, Inc. v. Sup. Ct. (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1403,
1431; Williams v. Russ (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1215, 1223; Coprich v.
Superior Court (2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 1081, 1089–1090.) The court finds the
authority relied upon by Plaintiff regarding basic discovery rules
insufficient, and criminal procedure inapposite to a civil action. (Union Oil Co. of Cal. v. Reconstruction Oil Co. (1935) 4 Cal.2d 541,
545; People v. Superior Court
(Morales) (2017) 2 Cal.5th 523, 533
[addressing Penal Code section 1054.9].)
 
Plaintiff
preemptively challenges any argument regarding the finding of a mandatory or
prohibitory injunction. Plaintiff acknowledges the cases describing the
preservation of evidence standard against served defendants, but seeks to
distinguish any finding of injunctive relief in that the motion only seeks
preservation rather than an order requiring the affirmative act of
preservation. Defendants challenge the request as lacking a proper basis of
relief regardless of the form.
 
The court
finds the argument regarding a prohibition from destruction versus an order to
preserve factually indistinguishable for purposes of the subject motion. “[T]he general rule is that an injunction is prohibitory if
it requires a person to refrain from a particular act and mandatory if it
compels performance of an affirmative act that changes the position of the
parties.” (Davenport v. Blue Cross
of California (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 435, 446.) “An injunction designed to preserve the status quo as between the
parties and to restrain illegal conduct is prohibitory,
not mandatory, and does not require heightened appellate scrutiny.” (Oiye v. Fox (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th
1036, 1048.) “The granting of a mandatory
injunction pending trial is not permitted except in extreme cases where the
right thereto is clearly established.” (Teachers Ins. & Annuity Assn. v. Furlotti (1999) 70
Cal.App.4th 1487, 1493.) 
 
Given the
denial of any injunction, the motion itself lacks discussion of the elements
for injunctive relief—probability of success on the merits, irreparable harm,
and balance of equities. Again, the leading authority considers the requested
relief, at a minimum, as a form of protective order with injunctive relief
considerations. (Dodge, Warren & Peters Ins.
Services, Inc. v. Riley, supra, 105
Cal.App.4th at p. 1419; Northpoint Homeowners Assn v.
Superior Court, supra, 95
Cal.App.3d at pp. 244-246.) The court declines to either distinguish this
authority or make the arguments for Plaintiffs regarding the basis of relief.
 
Even if
the court considered the protective order and injunctive relief standards, the
court finds the broad based request—a lack of time, as well as product or
geographic boundaries—renders any such order prohibitively overbroad and
unwieldy. Any argument regarding the lack of any burden on sorting and
collating the files falls beyond the scope of the motion presented. The court
declines to simply require every potentially involved party to produce a
database of records for counsel in order to establish a new potential database
of information for potential future silicosis litigation. Barring a class
action proceeding, counsel must focus on each individual plaintiff, rather than
presenting a broadly based order shifting the burden to the parties to address
decades of business records involving a myriad of third parties.
