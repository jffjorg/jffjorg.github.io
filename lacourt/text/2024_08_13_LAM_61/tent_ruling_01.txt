  Case Number:  BC722308    Hearing Date:   August 13, 2024    Dept:  61 NIKE USA INC VS 5860 WEST JEFFERSON LLC ET ALTENTATIVE“The court may, upon motion of the injured party, or its own motion, correct clerical mistakes in its judgment or orders as entered, so as to conform to the judgment or order directed, and may, on motion of either party after notice to the other party, set aside any void judgment or order.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 473, subd. (d).)Plaintiff Nike USA, Inc. (Nike) moves for correction of this court’s statement of decision and judgment because it claims these documents incorrectly stated that judgment was in favor of Defendants 5860 West Jefferson, LLC, 5860 West Jefferson 1, LLC, and Samitaur Constructs (Defendants) “on all causes of action alleged in the complaint.” (4/26/2024 Statement of Decision; 5/14/2024 Judgment.) Nike argues that this ruling contradicts the court’s prior order of October 5, 2020, granting Nike’s motion for summary adjudication on its sixth cause of action for restitution in the amount of $6,669,117.53. (10/5/2020 Order.)Nike is correct. Neither the court’s statement of decision nor judgment indicated that the court intended to reconsider its prior order granting summary adjudication on Nike’s restitution claim. Rather, the statement of decision stated in a footnote that the restitution claim “was adjudicated previously in favor of Plaintiff and thus was not at issue in this trial.” (4/26/2024 Statement of Decision p. 2, fn. 1.) Thus the court’s statement at the end of its decision, indicating that judgment was for Defendants on all claims, was a clerical error.The unopposed motion is GRANTED. The judgment is properly amended to state that judgment is in favor of Defendants on the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and seventh causes of action in Nike’s First Amended Complaint, while judgment on the sixth cause of action is in favor of Nike in the amount of $6,669,117.53 against Defendants.Moving party to give notice.
