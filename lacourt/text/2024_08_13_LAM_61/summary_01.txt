And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Nike's motion for correction of the court's statement of decision and judgment. The court had previously incorrectly stated that judgment was in favor of the defendants on all causes of action, but this ruling contradicts the court's prior order granting summary adjudication on Nike's restitution claim. The judge has determined that the statement of decision and judgment contained a clerical error and has amended the judgment to reflect that judgment is in favor of the defendants on certain causes of action and in favor of Nike on its restitution claim in the amount of $6,669,117.53.
