 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Plaintiff Hathway Ranch Museum’s Motion to Compel Responses to Form
  Interrogatories (Set Two); Request for Monetary Sanctions in the Amount of $1,897.50



                                                                                                
Background
 
On April 27, 2021, Plaintiff Hathaway Ranch Museum (“Plaintiff” or
“Plaintiff Hathaway Museum”) filed a complaint (“Complaint”) with this Court
alleging a single cause of action for conversion against Defendant Merrie
Hathaway (“Defendant”) and DOES 1-10 on the grounds that Defendant Merrie
Hathaway refused to return property belonging to Plaintiff—family photographs,
guest books, silverware, dishes, furniture, maps, and other documents and
records—despite Plaintiff’s lack of consent. 
(See Complaint, ¶¶ 6-11.)
Plaintiff filed this motion to compel responses to Form
Interrogatories on June 4, 2024. No opposition has been received, despite a
proof of service. A reply was filed on July 9, 2024, proposing that the motion
be continued to the date of a companion motion to deem responses to RFAs
admitted.
 
Motion to Compel
Responses to Form Interrogatories
            Legal
Standard
            “Within 30
days after service of interrogatories, the party to whom the interrogatories
are propounded shall serve the original of the response to them on the
propounding party...” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.260(a).) The propounding party on
a set of interrogatories may agree to extend the time for service beyond that
30 days. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.270.) If the propounded party does not respond
in the appropriate amount of time, the propounding party may move for an order
to compel responses. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290(b).)
            Sanctions
may be awarded under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, which
provides:  “The court shall impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”
 
            Motion
to Compel: CONTINUE TO BE HEARD ON 7/26/24 WITH MOTION TO DEEM RFAs ADMITTED
            Plaintiff
moves to compel initial responses to its Form Interrogatories (Set Two).  Plaintiff served Form Interrogatories (Set
Two) on November 14, 2023.  (Motion,
Mitch Dec., ¶2.)  The only interrogatory
propounded was Form Interrogatory 17.1, which asks for information regarding
any responses by Defendant to Plaintiff’s RFAs that were anything other than an
unqualified admission.  (Motion, Mitch
Dec., Ex. 1.)  Defendant failed to
respond to both the RFAs and Form Interrogatory 17.1.  Because Defendant’s obligation to respond to
Form Interrogatory 17.1 is dependent on her responses to the RFAs, this motion
to compel response to Form Interrogatory 17.1 is continued to July 26, 2024, so
that it may be heard with Plaintiff’s Motion to Deem RFAs admitted against
Defendant Merrie.  If the Court grants
the motion to deem RFAs admitted, this motion to compel responses to Form
Interrogatory 17.1 will be moot, as all RFAs would have been deemed admitted
against Merrie.  
 
Conclusion
            Plaintiff’s
motion is continued to July 26, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. No appearances are needed on
July 16, 2024.
