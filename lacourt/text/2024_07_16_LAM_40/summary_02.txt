And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants Samir B. Armaly's motion for an assignment order as to any rights of payment due to Stephen L. Goodman from Improvement Network Investments LLC and Improvement Network Development Partners LLC, and denies the request as to other payments due to Goodman. The ruling also grants Armaly's motion for a charging order as to Goodman's membership interests in the LLCs. The court finds that the loan agreement between the Trust and the Buyers was breached, and that the judgment debtor, Goodman, is liable for the outstanding obligation. The court orders that Goodman's membership interests in the LLCs be charged to satisfy the judgment. The ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure §708.510, which allows a judgment creditor to obtain an assignment order directing the judgment debtor to assign to the creditor all or part of a right to payment due or to become due.
