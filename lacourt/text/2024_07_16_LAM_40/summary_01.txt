And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion filed by the plaintiff, Hathway Ranch Museum, to compel responses to Form Interrogatories (Set Two) and to request monetary sanctions of $1,897.50. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant, Merrie Hathaway, refused to return property belonging to the plaintiff, including family photographs, guest books, and other documents, despite the plaintiff's lack of consent. The plaintiff served the Form Interrogatories on November 14, 2023, but the defendant failed to respond. The judge is continuing the motion to be heard on July 26, 2024, along with a companion motion to deem responses to RFAs admitted. The judge notes that if the motion to deem RFAs admitted is granted, the motion to compel responses to Form Interrogatory 17.1 will be moot, as all RFAs would have been deemed admitted against Merrie Hathaway.
