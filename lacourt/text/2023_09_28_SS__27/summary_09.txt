Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted a motion by Ardy Pirnia, counsel for Plaintiff Hilario Salinas, to be relieved as counsel of record. The motion was filed due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, as the client has not cooperated with counsel and has not returned telephone calls or responded to requests related to the prosecution of the case. The court found that absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney's request for withdrawal should be granted. The motion was granted, and the judge ordered that the motion to be relieved as counsel is effective upon the filing of the proof of service of this signed order upon the Plaintiff.
