## English Summary

This tentative ruling concerns a motion by Defendants Adam Kligfeld and Havid Kligfeld to continue the trial date in the case of Gabriela Sabet-Baktash v. City of Los Angeles et al.  

The plaintiff, Ms. Sabet-Baktash, is suing the Defendants and the City of Los Angeles for injuries sustained in a trip and fall incident on a sidewalk adjacent to a property owned by the Defendants. The Defendants have reserved a hearing date for their summary judgment motion for February 22, 2024.  

The current trial date is November 16, 2023. The Defendants argue that good cause exists to continue the trial date because they are entitled to have their summary judgment motion heard before trial. The Court agrees and grants the continuance of the trial date. However, the Court finds no reason to continue all trial-related dates and they remain tied to the November 16, 2023 trial date. The Final Status Conference is continued to March 28, 2024, and the Non-Jury Trial is continued to April 11, 2024.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

Judge Kerry Bensinger has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendants' motion to continue the trial date. The defendants, Adam Kligfeld and Havid Kligfeld, are seeking to continue the trial date to accommodate their motion for summary judgment, which is scheduled to be heard on February 22, 2024. The plaintiff, Gabriela Sabet-Baktash, opposes the motion, arguing that it is untimely and that the defendants have not yet filed their summary judgment motion. However, the judge finds that good cause exists to continue the trial date, given the defendants' reservation of the earliest available hearing date for their summary judgment motion. The judge has continued the trial to the first available date, but has not granted the defendants' request to set all trial-related dates to the new trial date. The parties are ordered to give notice of the tentative ruling, and the hearing on the motion to continue trial is continued to March 28, 2024.
