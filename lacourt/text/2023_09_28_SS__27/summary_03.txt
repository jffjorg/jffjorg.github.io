And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to continue the trial date. The defendants had requested a continuance to allow them to hear their summary judgment motion, which is scheduled for February 22, 2024. The judge found good cause to continue the trial date, but did not set all trial-related dates to the new trial date. Instead, discovery and other trial-related dates will remain tied to the original trial date of November 16, 2023. The judge has also continued the final status conference and non-jury trial to March 28, 2024 and April 11, 2024, respectively.
