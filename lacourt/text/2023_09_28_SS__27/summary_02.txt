And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Nicole Koenigsberger v. Antonia Lofaso Catering, Case No. 19STCV36594. The ruling concerns a motion by Erik C. Alberts, counsel for the plaintiff, to be relieved as counsel. The motion was filed on September 7, 2023, and the Judge has found that it does not comply with California Rule of Court rule 3.1362 in several ways. Specifically, the motion does not include all future hearings in the matter, the proposed order is incomplete, and there is no proof of service showing that the defendant has been served with notice of the motion. The Judge has ordered the motion to be continued to October 27, 2023, at 1:30 p.m. to allow counsel to correct the defects noted in the order.
