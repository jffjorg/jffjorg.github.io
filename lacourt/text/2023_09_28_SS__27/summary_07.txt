And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the petition to approve a compromise settlement between Nadya Valdez, a minor, and Jazmine Desarae Minor and Rosa Dilia Barrahona. The settlement amount is $27,500, with $4,375 to be used for medical expenses, $6,875 for attorney's fees, and $377.23 for other expenses. The remaining balance of $15,872.77 will be deposited in a blocked account at Wells Fargo Bank in San Fernando, California.

The Court has found that the settlement amount and the request for attorney's fees are fair and reasonable, and that the medical expenses and other expenses are supported by sufficient documentation. However, the petition cannot be approved in its current form because the petitioner has not yet been appointed guardian ad litem for the minor.

The Court is continuing the petition to October 24, 2023, at 1:30 PM, and directing the petitioner to file a revised petition consistent with this order or wait for a ruling on their application to be appointed guardian ad litem. The Court will not require the petitioner and the minor to attend the hearing.
