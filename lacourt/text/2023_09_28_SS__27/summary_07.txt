## English Summary:

In case 22STCV32133, Judge Kerry Bensinger is considering a petition by Carlos Valdez to approve a $27,500 settlement for his daughter, Nadya Valdez, a minor, against Jazmine Desarae Minor and Rosa Dilia Barrahona. 

The Court previously denied the initial petition because it lacked proper paperwork and contained inaccurate information.  The amended petition addresses these issues and proposes the allocation of settlement funds for medical expenses, attorney fees, and other expenses, with the remaining balance to be held in a blocked account.

However, the Court cannot approve the petition because Carlos Valdez has not yet been appointed guardian ad litem for Nadya.  

The hearing is continued to October 24, 2023, to allow Carlos Valdez to either file a revised petition reflecting his role as Nadya's father or to seek appointment as guardian ad litem.

English Summary:

Judge Kerry Bensinger, Department 27, issued a tentative ruling on September 28, 2023, for the case Selena Valdez, et al. v. Jazmine Desarae Minor, et al. (Case No.: 22STCV32133) regarding a petition to approve a minor's compromise. The petitioner, Carlos Valdez, filed a petition for his minor child, Nadya Valdez, to settle her claims against defendants Jazmine Desarae Minor and Rosa Dilia Barrahona for a lump sum of $27,500. However, the petition had several defects, including the failure to include proposed orders, incorrect settlement amount, and incorrect indication of Petitioner's role.

After an amended petition was filed on September 20, 2023, the court found the settlement amount and request for attorney's fees to be fair and reasonable. However, the petition cannot be approved because Petitioner has not yet been appointed guardian ad litem for Claimant, and the settlement funds cannot be deposited in a blocked account opened in the legal name of the petitioner as guardian ad litem of Claimant.

Therefore, the petition is continued to October 24, 2023, at 1:30 PM. Petitioner is required to file a revised petition consistent with this order no later than 5 court days before the hearing or wait for a ruling on Petitioner’s application to be appointed guardian ad litem for Claimant. The court will not require Petitioner’s and Claimant’s attendance at the hearing.
