And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the defendant's motion to continue the trial date. The defendant had requested to continue the trial to a date after February 1, 2024, and set all related cutoff dates to the new trial date. The court found good cause to continue the trial, citing the defendant's excuse for not having all essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent efforts. The court has continued the trial date to the first available date on the court's calendar, and has set all trial-related dates to the new trial date of April 12, 2024. The final status conference has been continued to March 29, 2024, and the non-jury trial has been continued to April 12, 2024.
