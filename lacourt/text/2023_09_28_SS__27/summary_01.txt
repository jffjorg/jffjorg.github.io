The judge, Kerry Bensinger, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Lucero Santos et al. v. Roosevelt Brown, II. The case involves a petition to approve a minor's compromise, where Claimant Abby Cortes, a minor, has agreed to settle her claims against Defendant Roosevelt Brown, II in exchange for $17,500.

The judge has rejected the petition due to several defects in the filing. Specifically, the petition contained inconsistencies on Form MC-350, failed to include an Order to Deposit Funds Into Blocked Account (Form MC-355), and did not provide information for the settlement balance to be deposited or invested. The judge has ordered the petitioner to file an amended petition consistent with the court's orders by October 27, 2023.

The judge has also set an OSC re: Sanctions of $250 for failure to file a petition consistent with the court's orders. If the petitioner submits another defective petition, the court will impose sanctions. The hearing is continued to October 27, 2023, at 1:30 p.m.
