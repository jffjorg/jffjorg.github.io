CASE:                                Selena Valdez, et al. v. Jazmine Desarae Minor, et al.
 
CASE NO.:                 22STCV32133
 





















 
PETITION
TO APPROVE MINOR’S COMPROMISE



 
MOVING PARTY:               Petitioner
Carlos Valdez
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition 
 
 
            Claimant,
Nadya Valdez, a minor, by and through her parent, Petitioner Carlos Valdez, has
agreed to settle her claims against Defendants, Jazmine Desarae Minor and Rosa
Dilia Barrahona, in exchange for a lump sum of $27,500.
 
            The
Petition was heard on August 24, 2023. 
The Court could not approve the Petition because (1) Petitioner did not
include proposed orders on Form MC-351 or MC-355; Item 18b(2) stated an
incorrect settlement amount after deductions for medical expenses, attorney’s
fees, and other expenses; and (3) Petitioner improperly indicated at Item 1
that was Claimant’s guardian ad litem when there was indication Petitioner had
been appointed guardian ad litem.
 
            On
September 20, 2023, Petitioner filed an amended Petition.  If approved, $4,375 will be used for medical
expenses, $6,875 will be used for attorney’s fees, and $377.23 will be used for
other expenses, leaving a balance of $15,872.77 for Claimant to be deposited at
Wells Fargo Bank in San Fernando, California, subject to withdrawal only upon
authorization of the court.
 
            Court
approval is required for all settlements of a minor’s claim.  (Probate Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; Code Civ. Proc. § 372.)  The petition must be verified and “must
contain a full disclosure of all information that has any bearing on the
reasonableness of the compromise, covenant, settlement, or disposition.”¿ (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)¿¿
 
            Petitioner
has cured most of the defects noted in the Court’s previous order.  Further, the Court finds the settlement
amount and the request for attorney’s fees to be fair and reasonable, and the
medical expenses and other expenses supported by sufficient documentation.  However, the Petition cannot be
approved.  At Item 3 of Form MC-355, Petitioner
indicates the settlement funds belonging to Claimant are to be deposited in a
blocked account opened in the legal name of the petitioner as guardian ad litem
of Claimant.  Petitioner, however, has
not yet been appointed guardian ad litem for Claimant. [1]
Based on the filings in this matter, it appears Petitioner is Claimant’s
father.  Claimant may have the settlement
funds deposited in a blocked account that is opened in the legal name of the
Petitioner as the parent of Claimant. 
            
            Accordingly,
the Petition is CONTINUED to October 24, 2023 at 1:30 PM.  Petitioner is to file a revised petition
consistent with this order no later than 5 court days before the hearing or
wait for a ruling on Petitioner’s application to be appointed guardian ad litem
for Claimant. The Court will not require Petitioner’s and Claimant’s attendance
at the hearing.¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.952, subd. (a).)¿ 
 
            Moving
party to give notice.
