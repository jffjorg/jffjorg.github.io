MOTION
TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL



 
MOVING PARTY:               Erik C.
Alberts, EA Law Firm, Inc. 
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
 
On September 7, 2023, Erik C. Alberts, counsel for Plaintiff,
Nicole Koengisberger, filed this Motion to be Relieved as Counsel.  
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARDS 
 
California Rule of Court rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be Relieved
as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and motion to be directed to the
client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel—Civil
form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general terms and without
compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a
motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of
filing a consent under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the Declaration
in Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-052));
(3) service of the notice of motion and motion and declaration on all other
parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order relieving
counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as
Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). 
 
The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw,
and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the
client, and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice.  (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  
 
III.       DISCUSSION 
 
Erik C. Alberts seeks to be relieved as counsel of record
for Plaintiff for the following reason: “After a paid private Mediation with
Judicate West’s Hon. Judge Theirry Colaw (ret.) in this matter on August 3,
2023, the professional relationship between the plaintiff and myself
precipitously deteriorated. Indeed, irreconcilable differences arose, the
details of which the attorney-client privilege forbids me from stating in this
Declaration. On August 30, 2023, the plaintiff NICOLE KOENIGSBERGER terminated
me as her counsel in this matter in a writing, which is attached as Exhibit “A”.”
 (MC-052.)   
 
Absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s
request for withdrawal should be granted.  (People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d
398, 406.).  
 
Upon review, the Court finds the Motion does not comply with
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 in the following ways:
 
·        
Counsel has not included all future
hearings in this matter.  Specifically,
Counsel has not included the date for the Final Status Conference.  
·        
The proposed order (Form MC-053) is
incomplete.  Counsel has not completed
Items 5, 7, 8, or 9.
·        
There is no proof of service showing
Defendant has been served with notice of this motion.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION         
            Accordingly,
the Motion is CONTINUED to October 27, 2023 at 1:30 p.m. to allow Counsel to
correct the defects noted in this order. 
Counsel is to file the amended Motion and proof of service no later than
5 court days before the rescheduled hearing. 

            Counsel to
give notice.  
Dated:   September 28,
2023                                                   ___________________________________
