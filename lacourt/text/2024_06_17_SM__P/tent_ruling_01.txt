Whether CCP
340.16 Revives the FEHA Administrative Claim Requirement
In
determining whether section 340.16 renders plaintiff’s claims timely, the court
must “‘determine the Legislature’s intent so as to effectuate the law’s
purpose.’ (People v. Murphy (2001) 25 Cal.4th 136, 142, 105 Cal.Rptr.2d
387, 19 P.3d 1129.)” Skidgel v. California Unemployment Ins. Appeals Bd.
(2021) 12 Cal.5th 1, 14. “’We begin by examining the statutory language, giving
it a plain and commonsense meaning. [Citation.] We do not, however, consider
the statutory language in isolation; rather, we look to the entire substance of
the statutes in order to determine their scope and purposes.” People v. Cole
(2006) 38 Cal.4th 964, 975, 44 Cal.Rptr.3d 261, 135 P.3d 669.” Id.
 
As amended in
2022, section 340.16 “applies to any action described in subdivision (a) that
is based upon conduct that occurred on or after January 1, 2009, and is
commenced on or after January 1, 2019, that would have been barred solely
because the applicable statute of limitations has or had expired.” Code Civ.
Proc. §340.16(b)(3). Section 340.16(b)(3) “applies to any action
described in subdivision (a) that is based upon conduct that occurred on or
after January 1, 2009 …” Code Civ. Proc. §340.16(b)(3). Subdivision (a) applies
to “any civil action for recovery of damages suffered as a result of sexual
assault.” Code Civ. Proc. §340.16(a) (italics added). 
 
The 2022
amendment added subdivision (e), which establishes a one-year window reviving
claims seeking damages for sexual assault where plaintiff alleges defendant
“engaged in a cover up or attempted a cover up of a previous instance or
allegations of sexual assault by an alleged perpetrator of such abuse.” Code
Civ. Proc. §340.16(e)(2)(C); Stats 2022, ch. 442, §3. “Cover up” is defined as
“a concerted effort to hide evidence relating to a sexual assault that
incentivizes individuals to remain silent or prevents information relating to a
sexual assault from becoming public or being disclosed to the plaintiff …” Code
Civ. Proc. §340.16(e)(4)(A). Section 340.16(e) revives “any related claims,
including, but not limited to, wrongful termination and sexual harassment,
arising out of the sexual assault that is the basis for a claim pursuant to
this subdivision.” Code Civ. Proc. §340.16(e)(5).
 
The court
could find no reading of the statute, legislative history or case law
supporting the proposition that the two revival statutes distinguish between a
perpetrator defendant or an entity defendant. 
 
Claim
Presentation Requirement re: Plaintiff’s FEHA Claims (1st to 4th COAs)
Local 80
Defendants and TCFF contend plaintiff’s FEHA claims (the first through fourth
causes of action) fail due to plaintiff’s failure to timely exhaust
administrative remedies.
 
Prior to
filing a civil action, a FEHA administrative complaint must be filed within
three years. Gov. Code §12960. A plaintiff must thereafter bring a civil action
under FEHA within one year after the date of the Department’s right-to-sue
notice or notice of completion of investigation. Gov. Code §12965(c)(1)(C).
“[E]xhaustion of the FEHA administrative remedy is a precondition to bringing a
civil suit on a statutory cause of action” and failure to do so results in
dismissal. Rojo v. Kliger (1990) 52 Cal.3d 65, 83; Okoli v. Lockheed
Technical Operations (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 1607, 1613. 
 
Plaintiff
argues the legislative purpose of section 340.16 was to revive claims barred by
the statute of limitations, and this revives her FEHA claims. The court
disagrees; filing of the administrative claim is a jurisdictional prerequisite
to filing of a complaint, similar to a governmental tort claim, as is argued by
defendants. The Legislature could have specified the ability to file a FEHA
administrative claim was also revived via the statute; it did not do so. The
court declines to read such into the statute. 
 
Section
340.16 does not expressly revive lapsed claims under FEHA. Shirk v. Vista
Unified School Dist. (2007) 42 Cal.4th 201 (superseded by statute) is
instructive, as it considered whether Code Civ. Proc. §340.1, which revived
claims that were “solely” barred by the statute of limitations, also revived
the time in which to present a claim under the Government Claims Act. Shirk
held the claim was not revived by 340.1 because it was not barred “solely” by
the lapse of the statute of limitations but by plaintiff’s failure to present a
timely governmental tort claim. The court noted, “Had the Legislature intended
to also revive . . . the claim presentation deadline under the government
claims statute, it could have easily said so. It did not.” Shirk, 42
Cal.4th at 213. Shirk’s analysis is applicable here. 
 
Plaintiff’s
reliance on Pollock v. Tri-Modal Distribution Services, Inc. (2021) 11
Cal.5th 918 is misplaced. Plaintiff cites no authority, and the court could
discern none, that holds section 340.16 applies to administrative exhaustion. 
 
Filing the
FEHA claim is a jurisdictional prerequisite; it is not a statute of limitations.
Civil claims against employers for assault were indeed revived by the statute,
but the statute did not (but could have) include revival of time to file the underlying
administrative claim required to pursue a FEHA claim. 
 
As to all the
FEHA claims in the first through fourth causes of action, TCFF and Local 80
Defendants’ demurrers are SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.
 
Demurrer
to the Remaining Claims (5th to 12th COAs)
Section
340.16(a) revives sexual assault claims and applies to any action “that would
have been barred solely because the applicable statute of limitations has or
had expired.” Code Civ. Proc. §340.16(b)(3). 
 
Under section
340.16(e), claims are revived where a plaintiff who alleges the entities
legally responsible for the damages arising out of the assault engaged in a cover
up (see discussion above). Related claims include “wrongful termination and
sexual harassment, arising out of the sexual assault…” Code Civ. Proc.
§340.16(e)(5). Based on this statutory framework and because plaintiff filed
her complaint more than 10 years from the date of the alleged sexual assault,
the complaint must sufficiently allege facts of a cover up in accordance with section
340.16(e) to revive claims against defendants.
 
TCFF’s Demurrer
to Labor Code Claims (5th to 7th COAs) and Wrongful Termination (8th COA)
As to the fifth, sixth, and seventh cause of action for retaliation in
violation of Labor Code sections 1102.5, 98.6, and 6310, TCFF argues they are
time-barred under section 340.16(a) or (e) which would allow ten years at most,
and contends the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to revive
plaintiff’s retaliation claim. They argue the complaint fails to allege facts
(1) that make TCFF legally responsible for the alleged retaliation and (2)
supporting an attempt by TCFF to cover up the alleged assault.
 
Labor Code
section 1102.5 states that “[a]n employer . . . shall not retaliate against an
employee for disclosing information, or because the employer believes that the
employee disclosed or may disclose information, to a government or law
enforcement agency, to a person with authority over the employee or another
employee who has the authority to investigate, discover, or correct the
violation . . . if the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the
information discloses a violation of state or federal statute . . . .” 
 
TCFF argues plaintiff has not pled sufficient
supporting a cover up. The complaint alleges “[O]n or about the
following day, Plaintiff made a police report about the sexual assault.” Compl.
¶18(d). Plaintiff
alleges Conover told her not to mention the assault “if she wanted to work in
the entertainment industry ever again,” and Davis “failed to address” her
complaints. Compl.
¶18(e). Even read
expansively, this is not sufficient to allege a cover up, a “concerted effort
to hide evidence,” as required by §340.16(e)(4)(A). SUSTAINED WITH LEAVE TO
AMEND.

 

TCFF’s Demurrer
to Intentional Torts – Sexual Battery (9th COA), Gender Violence (10th COA),
and IIED (12th COA)
Plaintiff
asserts intentional torts against TCFF: sexual battery (Ninth COA); gender
violence (Tenth COA); and intentional infliction of emotional distress (Twelfth
COA).
 
TCFF there are three legal theories under which TCFF could be “legally
responsible” for an intentional tort by Hernandez or Farrands: (a) agency, (b)
respondeat superior, or (c) ratification. An employer may be vicariously liable
for employees’ conduct, “even if the conduct is criminal, in one of three ways:
(1) if the principal directly authorized . . . [the tort or] crime to be
committed’” [citations omitted]; (2) if the agent commits the tort ‘in the
scope of his employment and in performing a service on behalf of the principal’
[citations omitted] ‘regardless of whether the wrong is authorized or ratified
by [the principal]’ [citations omitted] and even if the wrong is criminal
[citations omitted]; or (3) if the principal ratifies its agent’s conduct
‘after the fact by. . .Voluntary[ily] elect[ing] to adopt the [agent’s] conduct
. . . as its own. [citations omitted].” Doe v. Roman Catholic Archbishop of
Los Angeles (2016) 247 Cal.App.4th 953, 969. 

 
TCFF argues the assault substantially deviated from employment duties,
so TCFF should not be liable for personally motivated misconduct. TCFF relies
on Lisa M. v. Henry Mayo Newhall Mem’l. Hosp. (1995) 12 Cal. 4th 291,
296-297, Myers v. Trendwest Resorts (2007) 148 Cal. App 4th 1403, 1426
and similar cases. However, those were summary judgment cases not applicable
here. 
 
At this point, plaintiff sufficiently alleges
respondeat superior liability. The court must take as true all allegations on
demurrer. The complaint alleges the assault arose during plaintiff’s employment
because plaintiff was lured to the bar to pick up her check. Compl. ¶18(b).
Plaintiff’s supervisors Hernandez and Ferrands are alleged to have abused
job-created authority. See Mary M. v. City of Los Angeles (1991)
54 Cal. 3d 202, 209. These allegations are sufficient to allege respondeat
superior at the demurrer stage. OVERRULED.

 
TCFF’s Demurrer to Negligent Supervision and Retention (11th
COA)

TCFF argues the complaint does not allege facts that establish TCFF knew
or should have known Hernandez or Farrands engaged in sexual assault or had the
propensity to sexually assault plaintiff. TCFF argues for section 340.16 to
apply to the negligence claim, there must be a nexus between the alleged
negligence and the assault. TCFF argues the complaint does not allege
sufficient facts to establish a factual nexus between the alleged assault and
TCFF’s employment of plaintiff, Hernandez and Farrands. 
 
Plaintiff points to
the allegations at ¶¶ 103-104, 109, and 125-126, which allege Entity Defendants
knew or should have known of Individual Defendants’ misconduct, yet took no
action against them, nor put in place measures to protect plaintiff. On
demurrer, this is sufficient. OVERRULED.

 

Local 80
Defendants’ Demurrer to Labor Code Retaliation Claims (5th to 7th COAs),
Intentional Torts (9th, 10th, and 12th COAs), and Negligent Supervision and
Retention (11th COA)
Local 80
Defendants demur as to retaliation in violation of Cal. Labor Code §§ 1102.5, 98.6,
and § 6310, and negligent supervision and retention as barred by the statute of
limitations, failure to state sufficient facts, and failure to adequately
allege that Local 80 is legally responsible, or engaged in a cover up, for the
alleged sexual assault. Local 80 Defendants demur as to the ninth and tenth
causes of action (sexual battery, gender violence) for failure to state
sufficient facts establishing any agency or other relationship between Local
80, and TCFF and the individual defendants that would render Local 80
Defendants liable for the actions of the Fox Defendants.
 
Local 80
Defendants demur to the twelfth cause of action (intentional infliction of
emotional distress) because it is derivative of the sexual battery and gender
violence cause of action and fails to allege “outrageous” conduct by Local 80. Defendants
assert plaintiff has not alleged Local 80 was (1) her employer or (2) “acting
on behalf of the employer” because the conclusory allegations are insufficient
to establish an agency relationship between Local 80 and TCFF. 
 
Plaintiff contends an agency relationship exists because
Local 80 ratified the actions of its members, Farrands and Hernandez, based on
Davis and Conover’s conduct (see para 18). Plaintiff asserts Local 80 aided and
abetted TCFF and its employees. Plaintiff asserts Local 80 is an employer and
agent of Fox by acting as a staffing agency and liable under respondeat
superior.
 
There are
no allegations that Farrands and Hernandez are members of Local 80. There are
no allegations that Conover’s alleged statement was binding on Local 80
Defendants. It is alleged his supervisor apologized to plaintiff. The
suggestion that Local 80 Defendants are agents of TCFF is contradicted by
allegations in the complaint. Local 80 Defendants are alleged to be labor organizations. See Compl.
¶¶4(c), 8. Respondeat superior has not been sufficiently alleged because Local
80 was not to be the assailants’ employer.
 
Plaintiff’s
allegations that Local 80 Defendants engaged in a cover up are conclusory
because there are no allegations as to how their actions constitutes a cover up,
as defined by Code Civ. Proc. §340.16(e)(4)(A). Conover’s alleged statement is
insufficient to suggest the Local 80 Defendants engaged in a concerted effort
to incentivize plaintiff to remain silent. SUSTAINED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.
 
Dismissal
re: Local 80 IATSE Building Corporation
Local 80
IATSE Building Corporation argues it is not a proper defendant because it “is
not a labor organization, does not have any members, does not provide any
representational services, and has no contractual or other relationships
whatsoever with Fox or the individual defendants.” Plaintiff argues the
assertion that Local 80 IATSE Building Corporation is not a labor organization
is inappropriate at the pleading stage. This would require a factual finding,
beyond the scope of demurrer. OVERRULED.
 
Plaintiff to file an amended complaint
within 20 days.
