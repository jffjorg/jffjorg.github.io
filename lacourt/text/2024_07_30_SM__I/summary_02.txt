And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge is considering a motion to dismiss a cross complaint filed by Ashkars and McCoy against Fenske, a licensed architect. Fenske claims that the cross-complainants failed to comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 411.35, which requires a plaintiff (or cross-complainant) to file a certificate verifying consultation with a licensed professional before suing a professional for professional negligence. The certificate was not filed in this case. Fenske argues that the cross-complainants' failure to file the certificate means that the court lacks jurisdiction to hear the case. The cross-complainants argue that the issue can only be raised by demurrer or motion to strike, and that Fenske's motion to dismiss is untimely. The judge has reviewed the case law and concludes that the statute's purpose was to require a plaintiff (or cross-complainant) to consult with a professional before suing a professional, and that the language permitting a demurrer or motion to strike was not meant to be the exclusive way to challenge a complaint. The judge decides to exercise its discretion and consider Fenske's untimely motion to dismiss as a motion to strike. The judge grants the motion to dismiss, but will allow the cross-complainants to file a compliant certificate if they can.
