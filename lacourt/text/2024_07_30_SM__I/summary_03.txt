And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the court has concerns about how the plaintiff did not receive any of the notices sent regarding the case. The court notes that there were at least three opportunities to contact the defendant, including sending out service, posting service, and mailing a default notice, but the defendant did not respond. The court is puzzled by this and will need to inquire into the matter. The Judge is willing to grant ex parte relief if the defendant provides a reasonable explanation for their lack of response, but will only do so if the defendant deposits two months' rent into court within 24 hours. The hearing date has been advanced to July 30, 2024.
