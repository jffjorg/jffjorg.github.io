And here is the English text summary:

The tentative ruling reiterates that the motion to vacate the default judgment will be denied unless the judgment is deemed void. The court finds that the defendant was aware of the problem and the default for two years, but did nothing until filing the motion, which is deemed intentional and not excusable neglect. The court notes that a void judgment can be attacked at any time and can be attacked collaterally, but only if the infirmity is apparent from the face of the judgment roll alone. The court finds that the proof of service appears valid on its face, and even if service was not proper, the defendant has not shown that they were unaware of the lawsuit or the default until shortly before filing the motion. The court will consider the issue of the amount of the judgment being greater than the amount set forth in the complaint, but will not consider any other aspects of the motion.
