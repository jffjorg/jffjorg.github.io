And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion to deem requests for admission (RFAs) admitted. The plaintiff, Carmen Garcia Orozco, moved to deem the RFAs admitted against the defendant, FCA US LLC, because the defendant failed to serve responses to the RFAs in a timely manner. The defendant served responses to the RFAs on August 27, 2024, which was after the deadline of July 30, 2024. The judge has denied the motion, finding that the motion is moot since responses have been served. The judge has also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions, reasoning that the discovery dispute could have been resolved without court intervention.
