Hearing Date: October 24, 2024
Department 54, Judge Maurice A. Leiter
Motion to Deem Requests for Admission
Admitted
Moving Party: Plaintiff Carmen Garcia Orozco
Responding Party: Defendant FCA US LLC
 
T/R:      PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO DEEM RFAS
ADMITTED IS DENIED.
 
THE REQUESTS FOR SANCTIONS ARE DENIED.
 
PLAINTIFF TO NOTICE. 
 
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, please
email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with
notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the
day of the hearing.
The Court considers the moving papers
and opposition.
 
If a party fails to provide a timely
response to a request for admission, the party waives any objection to the
requests.  (C.C.P. § 2033.280(a).)  Moreover, “[t]he requesting party
may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of
any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a
monetary sanction….”  (C.C.P. § 2033.280(b).) 
 
Plaintiff moves to deem RFAs admitted
against Defendant on the ground that Defendant failed to serve responses to
RFAs. Plaintiff served the RFAs on June 25, 2024. Responses were due on July
30, 2024. In opposition, Defendant represents that responses were served on
August 27, 2024. 
 
As responses have been served, this
motion is MOOT. The Court declines to award sanctions as this discovery dispute
could have been resolved without court intervention.
