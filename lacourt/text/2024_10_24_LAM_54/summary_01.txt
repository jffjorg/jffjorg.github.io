Significant Statements:
  - "The purpose of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties' pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute." (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843)
  - "To establish a triable issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce 'substantial responsive evidence.'" (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166)
  - "Challenging the pleadings, particularly where the Court already has found the pleadings sufficient, does not shift the evidentiary burden on summary adjudication."
