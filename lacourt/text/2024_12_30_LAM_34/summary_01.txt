And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion of Defendant's counsel, Roberta A. Krasney, to be relieved as counsel. The motion was filed on November 6, 2024, and the court has determined that it does not comply with the requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. Specifically, the motion lacks the required forms and proposed order. Counsel declared that there was an irremediable breakdown in communication with Defendant, but the court has determined that the requirements of the rule must be met. The court also considered that trial is scheduled for January 21, 2025, which is less than a month away, and that there is a high risk of prejudice to Defendant and Plaintiff if Counsel's withdrawal is granted. Therefore, the Judge has denied the motion.
