And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, Walmart, Inc., moves the court to compel the plaintiff, Sajjad Takallou, to respond to discovery requests, including Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, Request for Production of Documents, and Request for Admissions. The court grants the defendant's motions to compel and also grants the defendant's request to deem admitted the defendant's requests for admissions.

The plaintiff failed to timely respond to the discovery requests, and the court finds that the plaintiff has waived any objection to the requests. The court orders the plaintiff to provide objectionless responses within 20 days.

The defendant also seeks sanctions in the amount of $1,240.00 against the plaintiff for the defendant's reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred in preparing and filing the motions. The court grants the defendant's request for sanctions in the reduced amount of $1,240.00.
