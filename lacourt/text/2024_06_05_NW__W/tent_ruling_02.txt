Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests,
the court may make an order compelling responses. (CCP §§ 2030.290, 2031.300,
2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails to
serve a timely response to the discovery request waives any objection to the
request, including one based on privilege or the protection of attorney work
product. (CCP §§2030.290(a), 2031.300(a), 2033.280(a); Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 404.)
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may
also move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of
any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a
monetary sanction. (CCP § 2033.280(b).)
 
On February 16, 2024, Defendant served Plaintiff with their answer and
discovery requests including Defendant’s Form Interrogatories,
Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, Request for Production of Documents,
Set One, and Request for Admissions, Set One. (Cummings Decl. ¶¶4-5, Exhs. A,
B.) Plaintiff’s responses to the discovery requests were due no later than
March 22, 2024. (Cummings Decl. ¶6.) To date, however, Defendant has not
received any response to the discovery requests. (Cummings Decl. ¶6.) 
 
The court finds Plaintiff has failed to
timely respond to Defendant’s properly served discovery request. Defendant’s unopposed
motions to compel Plaintiff’s responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One,
Special Interrogatories, Set One, Request for Production of Documents, Set One,
and deem Request for Admissions, Set One admitted is GRANTED. 
 
Plaintiff is ordered to provide, objectionless responses
