And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Sebastian Donovan and Arconex (Plaintiffs) versus Quantgene, Inc. and Johannes Bhakdi (Defendants). The Plaintiffs' motions to compel further responses to discovery are granted, and the Defendants are each sanctioned with $1,050.00, jointly and severally with counsel. The issues at hand relate to the breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unjust enrichment, intentional misrepresentation, and negligent misrepresentation, as well as the violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200. The Court finds that the Defendants' responses to discovery were evasive, incomplete, and contained meritless objections, and that they failed to offer substantial justification for their failure to adequately respond to discovery. As a result, the Court grants the Plaintiffs' motions to compel further responses and imposes sanctions on the Defendants.
