And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay the action pending the completion of arbitration. The plaintiff, Divya Gowri, filed a lawsuit against the defendants, Greenberg Gross, LLP, and others, alleging professional negligence, breach of contract, and breach of fiduciary duty. The defendants argued that the plaintiff signed a Lawyer-Client Contingent Fee Agreement with Gowri that contains a binding arbitration provision. The judge found that the defendants established by a preponderance of the evidence that an arbitration agreement exists and that the plaintiff's claims are covered by the agreement. The judge also found that the plaintiff failed to oppose the motion and therefore did not meet her burden to show that the arbitration agreement should not be enforced. As a result, the judge ordered the action to be stayed pending the completion of arbitration.
