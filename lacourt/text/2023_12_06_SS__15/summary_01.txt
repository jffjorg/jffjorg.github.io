And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion for trial preference filed by the Plaintiffs, Herbert Mesirow and Debbie Mesirow, on November 7, 2023. The Plaintiffs are seeking a preference for trial due to the age and health of Plaintiff Herbert Mesirow, who is 79 years old and has been diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma. The court finds that Plaintiff Mesirow has a substantial interest in the action as a whole and that his health is seriously compromised and will continue to decline. Therefore, the court grants the motion for trial preference to ensure Plaintiff Mesirow's participation in the litigation and trial while his health permits and to prevent prejudicing his interest. The trial is scheduled for April 1, 2024, and the parties are to meet and confer on a trial setting order.
