And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiffs' motion to reopen discovery and compel depositions of three witnesses, Charlie Cain, Michael Lewis, and Walter Rust. The motion was filed on December 4, 2023, and the hearing was held on December 6, 2023. The Judge ruled that the Plaintiffs did not show sufficient diligence in pursuing the depositions, particularly with the discovery cutoff date approaching. The Judge noted that the Plaintiffs had known about the witnesses' potential testimony for some time, but did not notice the depositions until after the cutoff date. The Judge also ruled that reopening discovery would interfere with trial preparation and prejudice the other parties.
