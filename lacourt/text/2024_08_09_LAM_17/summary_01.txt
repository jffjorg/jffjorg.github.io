And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting summary judgment to Healthcare Partners (HCP) for $61,680.13, Vaziri and Bond Legal for $12,000, and Carin Memmer for $26,319.87. The ruling is based on the Medicare Secondary Payer Act (MSPA) and its regulations, which require reimbursement of Medicare benefits when a settlement is reached. HCP, an Independent Physician Association (IPA), is entitled to recover the amount because Carin Memmer failed to exhaust the administrative appeal process. The court also reduced HCP's reimbursement by 11.4% to account for attorney's procurement costs. Additionally, the court found that Bond Legal and Vaziri Law Group are entitled to recover $12,000 in attorneys' fees based on the Retainer Agreement between them and Memmer.
