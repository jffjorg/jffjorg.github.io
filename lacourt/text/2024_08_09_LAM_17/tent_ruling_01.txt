Factual Background 
 
            This
action was brought by State Farm to determine which parties are entitled to funds
from a $100,000 settlement, which was reached in Carin Memmer’s personal injury
lawsuit with State Farm, the insurer for the at-fault parties. 
 
Discussion

 
            Healthcare
Partners argues that it is entitled to $61,680.13 pursuant to the Medicare
Secondary Payer Act (MSPA) and its regulations. 
 
The Medicare
Secondary Payer Act (MSPA) applies to settlements paid by automobile liability
insurers, called "primary plans", like State Farm in this case. (See
42 U.S.C. §1395y(b)(2)(A)(ii).) To ensure that these entities pay as primary,
Congress broadly prohibited all Medicare payments "to the extent that...
payment has been made, or can reasonably be expected to be made," by a
primary plan. (42 U.S.C. § 1395y(b)(2)(A)(i)-(ii).) However, in cases like
this, where Medicare benefits have already been incurred and paid, the MSPA
requires reimbursement of the conditional Medicare benefits. (42 U.S.C. §
1395y(b)(2)(B)(ii).) 
 
Healthcare
Partners is an Independent Physician Association (IPA) for short. IPAs like HCP
contract with Medicare Advantage Organizations (MAO) and are considered
"first-tier" or "downstream" entities under the Medicare
Act. (42 C.F.R. § 422.4.) HCP is funded by an MAO under a capitation
arrangement. HCP accepts a fixed monthly payment from Blue Shield for each MAO
member who chooses or is assigned to the IPA. "By administering Medicare
benefits, MAOs and downstream entities "assist, or [ ] help cany out, the
duties or tasks of the federal superior." (Escarcega v. Verdugo Vista
Operating Co., LP, (C.D. Cal. Apr. 8, 2020) No. CV 19-9478-GW-FFMX, 2020 WL
1703181, at *7 quoting Watson v. Philip Morris Companies, Inc. (2007)
551 U.S. 142, 152, 127 S. Ct. 2301, 2307, 168 L. Ed. 2d 42.)
 
            State
Farm filed its complaint in interpleader on January 21, 2020, the day after
completing a settlement of Memmer's personal injury claims. (SS  83.) Rather than paying the Medicare lien
within 60 days under protest and filing an administrative challenge to HCP's
lien as required by 42 U.S.C. § 405(h), Memmer asks this court to eliminate the
Medicare lien. However, administrative review is the only way Memmer can obtain
reduction of the Medicare lien outside of the formula. (42 C.F.R. § 411.37.) In
Heckler v. Ringer (1984) 466 U.S. 602, 614, the Supreme Court explained
that 42 U.S.C. § 405(h) makes 42 U.S.C. § 405(g), the Social Security program's
judicial review provision, “the sole avenue for judicial review of all claims
arising under the Medicare Act.” 
 
Here, HCP
submitted evidence that Memmer failed to exhaust the administrative appeal
process. Memmer did not address this argument in opposition. Moreover, Memmer did
not submit any evidence or argument which could dispute HCP’s contention that
section 411.37 provides the exclusive formula for calculating the reimbursement
of Medicare benefits. 
 
Accordingly,
the Court finds that HCP is entitled to recover. In its motion, HCP also argues
that the Court should decline to reduce HCP’s reimbursement by a proportional
share of attorney fees. However, the case cited in support was a Washington
State case which this Court declines to rely on. Here, Memmer was entitled by
law to challenge HCP’s entitlement to the settlement amount. Accordingly, the
Court reduces HCPs lien for proportionate fees at 11.4% ($12,000 [attorney’s
procurement costs]/$104,844 [total settlement].) 
 
HCP also
submitted evidence that on April 11, 2016, Memmer entered into a binding
agreement with the attorneys wherein Memmer agreed that in exchange for legal
representation, she would pay the firm their attorneys fees in the amount of
45% after a lawsuit has been filed and costs incurred as a result.
 
When the
award is paid by the client, the inquiry must focus on any agreement the client
bargained for and agreed to. Necessarily, the reasonableness of the agreed upon
fees must be viewed in light of the reasonable expectation of the client and
the circumstances which existed at the time he [or she] executed the
agreement." (People ex rel. Dep't of Transp. v. Yuki (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th
1754, 1770.)
 
HCP submitted
evidence that Bond Legal and VLG are owed $45,000 in attorneys’ fees based upon
the Retainer Agreement between them and Memmer for the personal injury case
(SUF 102).  However, HCP indicated, and
VLG and Bond Reserve confirmed in joinder, that Bond Legal and Vaziri Law Group
had agreed for purposes of this MSJ to limit their claim to $12,000. (SS 102.) 
 
Memmer’s
opposition did not contain any law or evidence which could support a reasonable
inference that Bond Legal and VLG are not entitled to recover.  Memmer’s own evidence indicates that the
attorney-client contract was initialed and signed by her. (Exh. 1.) Memmer’s
second exhibit, which is an email exchange, does not establish that the
attorney-client contract is not enforceable. Rather, those exchanges contain
assertions by counsel that Memmer’s interpretations of the law are incorrect. 
 
Based on the
foregoing, Defendant HCP’s motion, joined by Defendant VLG and Bond, for
summary judgment is granted. Healthcare Partners is
awarded $61,680.13, Vaziri and Bond Legal $12,000, and Memmer $26,319.87.
 
It is so ordered.
