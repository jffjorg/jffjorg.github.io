 
BACKGROUND
 
On February 27, 2018, Plaintiff
State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) filed an action
against Defendant Richard Varghese (“Defendant”) for subrogation, stemming from
an automobile collision that occurred on December 7, 2016 between Defendant, on
the one hand, and an individual insured by Plaintiff’s automobile insurance
policy, on the other hand.  See
generally Compl.  Plaintiff
compensated the insured for claimed damages in the total amount of $16,070.54
and filed the instant claim against Defendant for allegedly causing the
damages.  Id. at. ¶¶ 13-16.  On April 12, 2018, Defendant filed an Answer
to the Complaint.
 
On January 23, 2020, Plaintiff
filed a Notice of Settlement. Subsequently, on May 8. 2020, Plaintiff filed a
Stipulation for Dismissal with Reservation to Vacate and Enter Judgment Upon
Breach (“Stipulation”), signed by both parties, to dismiss the action on the
premise that Defendant would compensate Plaintiff for the settlement amount of
$11,947.78.  See May 8, 2020
Stipulation and Order.  On May 14, 2020,
the Court granted the order and dismissed the entire case without prejudice
pursuant to the Stipulation.  See May
14, 2020 Order.  
 
On December 22, 2023, Plaintiff
filed the instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal and Enforce a Settlement Agreement
and Enter Judgment (“Motion”). 
 
 
MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
            Plaintiff
asserts that the parties signed the Stipulation that contains the parties’
agreement for the Court to retain jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure §664.6 to enforce the terms of the stipulation and enter judgment in
the event of default.  The Court retained
jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 664.6.  Pursuant to the Stipulation, the parties
agreed to settle the matter for $11,947.78. An initial payment of $2,447.78 was
to be made by Defendant’s insurance carrier, and beginning on May 1, 2020, Defendant
was required to make monthly payments of $100.00 until the settlement is paid
in full.  Defendant’s insurance carrier only
made a payment of $298.78 on January 12, 2021, Plaintiff has only received
$3,500.00 from Defendant directly. 
Despite Plaintiff’s attempt to remind Defendant of his obligations under
the Stipulation by written notice, Defendant remains in default.  Also, Plaintiff is entitled to recovery of
costs per the Stipulation.

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Motion
to Enforce Settlement
A.        Legal Standard 
“If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing
signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If
requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to
enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.”  Code Civ. Proc., §
664.6(a).
 
C.        Merits
 
            Here, Plaintiff seeks to
enforce the Stipulation between the parties and enter judgment against
Defendant in the amount of $14,443.51, consisting of the principal settlement
amount, plus interest accrued thereon at 7% per annum, court costs, and
attorney fees, and less payments received from Defendant and his insurance
carrier.  Notice of Motion at pp. 1-2.  
 
Plaintiff argues that Defendant has
defaulted on payments and Plaintiff is seeking to set aside the dismissal and
enter judgment pursuant to the Stipulation.  Motion at pp. 1-2.  The Stipulation Agreement filed on May 8, 2020,
provides that Plaintiff and Defendant agreed to dismiss the action on the
premise that Defendant would compensate Plaintiff for the settlement amount of
$11,947.78.  See Stipulation at ¶ 4.
Defendant’s insurance carrier made a payment of $298.78 on January 12, 2021,
which is less than the agreed upon one-time payment of $2,447.78.  Mahfouz Decl. ¶ 7; Stipulation at ¶ 4(A).  Defendant was also obligated to make monthly
payments of $100 beginning on May 1, 2020, but Defendant has stopped monthly
payments since March 8, 2023.   Mahfouz
Decl. ¶ 6, 9.  Defendant has only paid
$3,500, and Plaintiff has sent written notices of the default on October 6,
2023 and November 3, 2023 as required under the stipulation.  Id., Exh. B.   Defendant
has not remedied this default.  Id.
at 10.
 
            Because
Defendant did not remedy the default within ten (10) days of receiving notice, Plaintiff
is entitled to have any dismissal in this action set aside and judgment entered
for the principal amount, minus credit for payments received, plus costs,
attorney fees, and interest at the legal rate. 
See Stipulation at ¶ 7. 
Therefore, Plaintiff seeks to have the dismissal set aside and judgment
entered in the amount of $14,443.51 as follows: $16,070.54 (principal amount),
minus $3,798.78 (combined payment made by Defendant and Defendant’s insurance
carrier), plus $505.00 (court costs), $794.64 (prejudgment interest at an
annual rate of 7%), and $872.11 (attorney fees).  Motion at pgs. 4-6.  The court costs consist of $430 in filing fees
and $75.00 service fee.  See
Memorandum of Costs.   With regard to the request for pre-judgment
interest, Plaintiff asserts that the daily interest rate, based on the
principal damage with an annual rate of interest of 7%, amounts to $3.08.  Motion at pg. 5.  Because 258 days has elapsed since the
default date, the total prejudgment interest is $794.64.  Ibid. 
Moreover, Plaintiff seeks attorney fees based on the amount permitted
under Local Rule 3.214, which equates to $872.11  
 
Therefore, because the Stipulation
is valid under Code of Civil Procedure § 664.6 and Defendant is in breach of
the Stipulation, the Court grants Plaintiff’s motion.
 
III.       Conclusion 
            
            Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s Motion to
Vacate Dismissal and Enforce Settlement Agreement and Enter Judgment is
GRANTED.  
 
The
dismissal entered on 05/14/2020 is set aside and vacated , and “Judgment by
Court  Pursuant to Stipulation”  in the total amount of $14,443.51 is entered
in favor of Plaintiff and against
Defendant Richard Varghese. 
 
The Moving party is ordered to give notice.
