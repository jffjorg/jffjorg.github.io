    BACKGROUND   On  February 22, 2022, Plaintiff Erika Prada (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against  Defendants Michael Jason West, Gardner Trucking, and Does 1 through 50,  alleging a single cause of action for negligence. The complaint alleged that Plaintiff  was involved in a motor vehicle accident on September 27, 2019 at the fault of  the defendants.    On  January 17, 2024, the Court dismissed the action without prejudice based on  Plaintiff’s failure to appear or take any action regarding the OSC re Dismissal  Pending Settlement.    On January 30, 2024, Plaintiff  filed the instant motion to set aside the dismissal.    MOVING PARTY  POSITION               Plaintiff  moves to set aside the default judgment entered against it based on its  attorney’s mistake due to a calendaring error. Counsel takes full  responsibility for failing to appear on January 17, 2024 on Plaintiff’s behalf.     OPPOSITION               None filed  as of February 23, 2024.    REPLY               None filed  as of February 23, 2024.   ANALYSIS   I.          Motion  to Set Aside Default Judgment  A.        Legal  Standard “Section  473(b) provides for both discretionary and mandatory relief. [Citation.”  Pagnini v. Union Bank, N.A. (2018) 28  Cal.App.5th 298, 302.  An application for relief under this section must  be made no more than six months after entry of the judgment, dismissal, order,  or other proceeding from which relief is sought and must be accompanied by an  affidavit of fault attesting to the mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect  of the moving party or its attorney.   Code  Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001)  94 Cal.App.4th 130, 143.  In addition, an  application for relief under this section “shall be accompanied by a copy of  the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed herein, otherwise the  application shall not be granted.”  Code  Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).  Relief  under this section is mandatory when based on an attorney affidavit of fault;  otherwise, it is discretionary.  Id.)  When relief from default and default judgment is the attorney’s fault, the  six-month period starts to run from the date of the entry of the default  judgment.  Code Civ. Proc., § 473, sub.  (b); Sugasawara v. Newland (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 294, 295. B.        Merits             Under  the mandatory provision of Section 473(b), the attorney’s neglect does not need  to be excusable.   Henderson v. Pacific Gas & Electric Co.  (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 215, 225.             Here,  based on the declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel, Plaintiff failed to appear at  the January 17, 2024 hearing due to a calendaring error by Counsel Michael  Akhidenor’s clerk.  See Akhidenor  Decl. ¶ 4.  Counsel Akhidenor takes full  responsibility for failing to appear on Plaintiff’s behalf and asserts that the  defendants would not be prejudiced.  Id.  at ¶¶ 5-6.  Thus, Plaintiff argues that  mandatory relief is warranted under Code of Civil Procedure § 473(b).  Motion at pp. 3-5.              Under the  circumstances, the Court finds that Plaintiff’s argument have merit.  Courts have found excusable neglect where the  attorneys relied on a member of their staff “to perform certain tasks,  including calendaring deadlines, and the staff member errs.”   See Renteria v. Juvenile Justice,  Dept. of Corrections and Rehabilitation (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 903,  911; see also Bergloff v. Reynolds (1960) 181  Cal.App.2d 349, 358-359; see also Alderman v. Jacobs (1954)  128 Cal.App.2d 273, 275-276.  Therefore,  the Court finds that Plaintiff is entitled to relief under the mandatory  provision of Code of Civil Procedure § 473(b).             Accordingly,  because Plaintiff’s counsel has admitted fault for his failure to appear at the  January 17, 2024, the Court grants the instant motion pursuant to Code of Civil  Procedure § 473(b). II.        Conclusion                           Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s Motion to Set Aside the  Dismissal Entered on 01/17/2024 is GRANTED.   The Court  sets and ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE Re:  Dismissal for Failure  to File Proof of Service for 04/18/2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Department 25 of the  Spring Street Courthouse.   Moving Party is ordered to  give notice
