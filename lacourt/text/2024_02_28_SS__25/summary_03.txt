And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the Plaintiff, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, is entitled to have the dismissal of the case set aside and judgment entered in the amount of $14,443.51 against the Defendant, Richard Varghese. The case stems from an automobile collision in 2016, and the parties entered into a settlement agreement in 2020. The agreement required the Defendant to make monthly payments of $100 until the settlement amount of $11,947.78 was paid in full. However, the Defendant failed to make the payments and is in default. The Plaintiff has sent written notices of the default to the Defendant, but the Defendant has not remedied the default. As a result, the Plaintiff is seeking to have the dismissal set aside and judgment entered in the amount of $14,443.51, which includes the principal settlement amount, interest, court costs, and attorney fees. The judge grants the Plaintiff's motion and orders the dismissal to be set aside and judgment to be entered in favor of the Plaintiff and against the Defendant.
