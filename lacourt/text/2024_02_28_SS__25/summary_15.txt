And here is the summary in English text:

Judge's Tentative Ruling: Defendant's Demurrer to Plaintiff's Complaint is Sustained with 20 days leave to amend.

The Court finds that the Complaint, which alleges racism and favoritism without providing any further information, fails to state a cause of action. The defendant's demurrer is sustained, but the plaintiff is granted 20 days leave to amend the complaint. The Court notes that the plaintiff did not provide sufficient information to support their allegations and did not engage in the meet and confer process as required by law.

The Court will give notice to the moving party.
