And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendant, Cassandra Bible, to the plaintiff, Mollie Avinger-Anderson's, Second Amended Complaint (SAC). The judge has agreed with the defendant's arguments that the SAC is ambiguous and unintelligible, and that the report made to the DMV is protected by the litigation privilege. The judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff cannot file an amended complaint to fix the defects. The judge has also denied leave to amend the SAC, citing the plaintiff's previous attempts at submitting an intelligible complaint, which have all been unsuccessful. The judge has ordered the plaintiff's counsel to submit a proposed form of Judgment of Dismissal to the court within 10 days of notice of the ruling.
