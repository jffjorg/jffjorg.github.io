And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the complaint filed by the Scholer plaintiffs against Bohrer and Bohrer Construction, Inc. (BCI). The plaintiffs allege that BCI breached their construction agreement by misrepresenting the project timeline and cost, and that Bohrer fraudulently induced them into signing the agreement. The judge has ruled in favor of BCI's demurrer on the breach of contract claim, finding that the agreement is unambiguous and that BCI did not contract directly with the Scholers. However, the judge has overruled BCI's demurrer on the fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims, finding that these claims are not barred by the economic loss rule. The judge has also overruled BCI's demurrer on the conversion claim, finding that the complaint adequately alleges that BCI took the Scholers' property. Finally, the judge has sustained BCI's demurrer on the indemnity claim, finding that it is not subject to demurrer.
