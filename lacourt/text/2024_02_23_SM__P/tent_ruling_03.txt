12518 Sunset Group
LLC et al. v. Lionscove Fund 1, LLC, Case No. 24SMCV00772
Hearing Date
February 23, 2024
Plaintiff 12518
Sunset’s Ex Parte Application for Temporary Restraining Order 
 
Plaintiff Sunset
Group obtained a mortgage loan from defendant Lionscove for $2,737,050, secured
by property owned by plaintiff Daron Campbell. Sunset states the loan included
$722,050 in construction funds, which were to be made available as construction
expenses were incurred. Sunset was required to incur expenses out-of-pocket,
which would then be reimbursed. Sunset states it could obtain reimbursement by
requesting a draw, which would result in Lionscove sending an inspector to the
property to determine how much of the construction fund should be disbursed. 
 
Sunset argues
Lionscove acted in bad faith, stalling reimbursements, delaying inspections,
and disbursing smaller payments than warranted, intending to stall the project
and foreclose on the property. Sunset states Lionscove is foreclosing on the property
but argues if it is able to obtain construction funds still being withheld by
Lionscove, the project can be completed, the property sold, and the loan paid
off in full. 
 
Sunset moves for a
TRO preventing the foreclosure, currently scheduled for February 26, 2024. 
 
Ex parte relief
will only be granted upon a “factual showing in a declaration containing
competent testimony of irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other
statutory basis for grating relief ex parte,” and only “in the plainest and
most certain of cases.” Newsom v. Superior Court (2020) 51 Cal.App.5th
1093, 1097. A temporary restraining order may be issued ex parte to preserve
the status quo pending a full evidentiary hearing on a motion for preliminary
injunction. See Landmark Holding Group, Inc. v. Superior Court (1987)
193 Cal.App.3d. 525, 527. 
 
Sunset seeks an ex
parte order preserving the status quo. Sale of the property would result in
irreparable harm, since as a matter of law real property is unique and its loss
constitutes irreparable injury. E.g., Wheat v. Thomas (1930) 209 Cal.
306. Failure to issue a TRO would essentially moot the claims alleged in Sunset’s
complaint. 
 
Lionscove, by
contrast, is unlikely to suffer comparable harm if the foreclosure sale is
delayed pending a hearing on a motion for a preliminary injunction. GRANTED,
pending hearing on a motion for preliminary injunction. The ex parte
application will be treated as the moving papers.
