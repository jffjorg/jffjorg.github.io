And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Sunset Group LLC's ex parte application for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to prevent the foreclosure of the property. Sunset alleges that Lionscove Fund 1, LLC has acted in bad faith by delaying reimbursements and inspections, and that Lionscove is attempting to stall the construction project and foreclose on the property. The judge finds that Sunset has made a sufficient showing of irreparable harm and immediate danger, and that the sale of the property would result in irreparable injury. The judge has ordered that the foreclosure sale be delayed pending a hearing on a motion for a preliminary injunction.
