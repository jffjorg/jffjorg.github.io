And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that Defendant Alkeme Insurance Services (AIS) demurrer to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) is overruled. AIS argued that Plaintiffs cannot state a claim against it because it played no role in the events supporting the claim and because Plaintiffs are mistaken that AIS has any interest in or ownership of Snapp & Associates Insurance Services, LLC (SNAPP). The judge rejected AIS's arguments, finding that Plaintiffs have adequately pled a successor relationship between AIS and SNAPP and that AIS is liable for the torts of its predecessor, SNAPP. The judge also rejected AIS's argument that Plaintiffs' claims are uncertain and insufficient to show that AIS is a successor-in-interest to SNAPP, finding that Plaintiffs have alleged specific facts that could show a successor-in-interest relationship. Finally, the judge denied AIS's motion to strike Plaintiffs' prayer for punitive damages, finding that Plaintiffs have necessarily set forth sufficient facts that could show malice, fraud or oppression.
