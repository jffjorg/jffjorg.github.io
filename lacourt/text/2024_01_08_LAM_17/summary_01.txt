The Court also found that the Defendant must produce documents related to the evaluation of a pre-litigation repurchase request under the Song-Beverly Act. The Court denied the motion to compel on certain topics related to training and found that the topics and documents requested by the Plaintiffs were overly broad and irrelevant in some cases. The Court declined to award sanctions at this time. The tentative ruling will be adopted as the final order unless parties submit opposing arguments or the motion is placed off calendar.
