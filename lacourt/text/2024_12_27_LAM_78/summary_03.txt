And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for attorney fees and costs filed by the Law Offices of Isaac Kohen on behalf of the prevailing party, Isaiah Lomeli Barrios and Brenda Alvarez, against Nissan North America, Inc., et al. The judge grants the motion in part, awarding the Law Offices of Isaac Kohen $40,245.00 in attorney fees and $1,104.83 in costs.

The judge finds that the hourly rate of $525.00 per hour sought by Kohen is reasonable, but reduces the rate to $285.00 per hour for Imber, finding that Imber's rate is less well-supported. The judge also reduces the number of hours billed by 15.9 hours, finding that some of the entries were unnecessary or duplicative.

The judge declines to award a lodestar multiplier, finding that the quality of representation was not exceptional and that the contingency risks, skill, and difficulty were absorbed by the hourly rates.

The judge grants the motion for attorney fees and costs, finding that the prevailing party is entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees and costs under the Song-Beverly Warranty Act.
