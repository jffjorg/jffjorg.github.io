BACKGROUND On January 10, 2023, plaintiffs Isaiah Lomeli Barrios and Brenda Alvarez (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed this action under the Song-Beverly Warranty act against defendant Nissan North America, Inc. (“Defendant”). On April 16, 2024, counsel advised the Court that the case had been settled. A notice of settlement was ordered to be filed by April 30, 2024. (Min. Order, April 16, 2024.) On August 23, 2024, Plaintiffs’ counsel stated settlement was not complete and that a Motion for Attorney Fees would be filed. The Court ordered counsel to file the motion by or before August 30, 2024. (Min. Order, Aug. 23, 2024.) On September 12, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the Motion for Attorney Fees. On December 13, 2024, Defendant filed an opposition. On December 16, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a reply.  II. LEGAL STANDARD¿ Attorneys’ fees are allowed as costs when authorized by contract, statute, or law. (Code Civ. Proc, § 1033.5, subd. (a)(10)(B).) In a lemon law action, costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees, may be recovered by a prevailing buyer under the Song-Beverly Act. (See Civ. Code, § 1794(d).) Section 1794 provides: “If the buyer prevails in an action under this section, the buyer shall be allowed by the court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on actual time expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action.” (Civ. Code, § 1794.) Thus, the statute includes a “reasonable attorney’s fees” standard.  The attorney bears the burden of proof as to “reasonableness” of any fee claim. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(c)(5).) This burden requires competent evidence as to the nature and value of the services rendered. (Martino v. Denevi (1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 553, 559.) “Testimony of an attorney as to the number of hours worked on a particular case is sufficient evidence to support an award of attorney fees, even in the absence of detailed time records.” (Ibid.) A plaintiff’s verified billing invoices are prima facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and services listed were necessarily incurred. (See Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682.) “In challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to the evidence. General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice.” (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 488, quoting Premier Med. Mgmt. Sys., Inc. v. California Ins. Guarantee Ass’n (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.) The Court has discretion to reduce fees that result from inefficient or duplicative use of time. (Horsford v. Bd. of Trustees of California State Univ. (2005) 132 Cal. App. 4th 359, 395.) In determining a reasonable attorney fee, the trial court begins with the lodestar, i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate. (Warren v. Kia Motors America, Inc. (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 24, 36.)  The lodestar may then be adjusted based on factors specific to the case in order to fix the fee at the fair market value of the legal services provided. (Ibid.) These facts include (1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award. (Ibid.)  III. DISCUSSION It is undisputed that Plaintiffs are the prevailing party in this action, and are therefore entitled to attorney fees, costs, and expenses pursuant to Cal. Civ. Code 1794(d). Defendant’s first contention is that the motion should be denied because Plaintiffs failed to file the motion by August 30, 2024, pursuant to the Court’s August 23, 2024 Order. In reply, Plaintiffs argue the late filing was based on a mistake since the parties stipulated in their joint status report that the fee motion would be filed by early September 2024, and that Defendant has not demonstrated that any late filing caused surprise or undue prejudice.  Here, the joint Status Report filed on August 20, 2024 reported that Plaintiffs would file the fee motion by early September 2024. Thereafter, the Hon. Michelle Kim ordered the parties to file the motion by August 30, 2024. Plaintiffs failed to abide by the Court’s later order, which takes precedence over the representations in the Status Report. Nonetheless, there is no basis to deny the motion in its entirety based on the late filing, as Defendant was able to fully oppose the motion, and there is no other apparent prejudice caused by Plaintiffs’ delayed filing. In the interests of justice, the Court will consider the motion on the merits notwithstanding Plaintiffs’ failure to follow the Court’s order. Plaintiffs move for an award of attorney fees and costs in the amount of $48,294.83, consisting of (1) $42,900.00 in attorney fees, (2) $1,104.83 in costs, and (3) a 1.1 multiplier enhancement on in the amount of $4,290.00. A. Reasonableness of Fees i. Reasonable Hourly Rate “The reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar work.” (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) “The experienced trial judge is the best judge of the value of professional services rendered in [her] court.” (Ibid.) Plaintiffs seek to recover attorneys’ fees for 2 different attorneys: (1) Isaac Kohen (“Kohen”) at $525.00/hour and (2) Tamara R. Imber (“Imber”) at $325.00/hour. Kohen attests that since he was admitted to practice in 2012, he has focused his practice primarily on CLRA and lemon law litigation, and has litigated approximately six hundred lemon law and CLRA cases for over a decade. (Kohen Decl. ¶¶ 16-17.) Kohen attests that Imber was admitted to practice law in 2021 and works as an associate at Law Offices of Isaac Kohen. (Kohen Decl. ¶ 19.) In opposition, Defendant argues that the hourly rate sought by Plaintiffs’ counsel is excessive, unsupported, and unreasonable. Defendants contend Kohen’s rate should be reduced to $400.00 per hour and Imbar’s to $265.00 per hour. In reply, Plaintiffs argue that Kohen’s rate is supported by his thirteen years of practice and multiple prior awards of his hourly rate of at least $500 and $525 for lemon law cases. Based on the Court’s review of the rates and Defendant’s lack of specificity as to why Kohen’s rate should be reduced to $400.00, the Court finds that Plaintiffs’ requested hourly rate for Kohen to be reasonable for attorneys with the experience stated in the his declaration. However, the Court finds Kohen’s attestation of Imber’s rate and experience to be lacking. Kohen merely provides that Imbar was admitted into practice three years ago, does not state when she began practicing lemon law, and provides in a conclusory manner that she had been approved in another department at an hourly rate of $285.00 (and attaches an exhibit that appears to support that she was approved in another department at an hourly rate of $295.00). Additionally, Plaintiffs’ reply does not provide any additional information, nor does it address Defendant’s contention challenging Imbar’s rate. Nevertheless, Defendant is also unspecific as to why Imber’s rate should be reduced to $265.00, or how Defendant arrived at that rate. As such, the Court finds Imbar’s $325.00 per hour rate to be less well-supported and reduces the rate to $285.00 per hour, the amount to which was attested and at least partially supported by the evidence. ii. Reasonable Hours Incurred “A trial court assessing attorney fees begins with a touchstone or lodestar figure, based on the ‘careful compilation of the time spent and reasonable hourly compensation of each attorney ... involved in the presentation of the case.” (Christian Research Institute v. Alnor (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1321.) “The reasonableness of attorney fees is within the discretion of the trial court, to be determined from a consideration of such factors as the nature of the litigation, the complexity of the issues, the experience and expertise of counsel and the amount of time involved. The court may also consider whether the amount requested is based upon unnecessary or duplicative work.” (Wilkerson v. Sullivan (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 443, 448.) A reduced award might be fully justified by a general observation that an attorney overlitigated a case or submitted a padded bill or that the opposing party has stated valid objections. (Gorman v. Tassajara Development Corp. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 44, 101.) Plaintiffs seek to recover attorneys’ fees for 65 hours spent by Kohen and 27 hours spent by Imbar litigating this matter for a total of 92 hours. (Kohen Decl. Ex. 1.) A plaintiff’s verified billing invoices are prima facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and services listed were necessarily incurred. (See Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682.)  Defendant argues Plaintiffs’ counsel block billed, and that the Court should reduce Plaintiffs’ block billing hours by half for a reduction of 15.9 hours. The Court has reviewed the specific entries provided in Exhibit A to Doudar’s Declaration. The Court finds that most of the entries are sufficiently delineated, such that the tasks do not make it difficult to determine the reasonableness of the bill, especially as the vast majority billed for a small fraction of an hour.  The Court also finds no reason to reduce billing for “administrative” tasks when it appears that they were necessary to the litigation, and the amount of time billed appears reasonable as it ranges mostly around 0.1 hours to 0.5 hours at the highest. Further, Defendant has not met its burden that the time spent to review documents, conduct research, and draft motions was excessive based on the argument that initial discovery and fee motions are templates that Plaintiffs’ counsel uses in every case. Even if Plaintiffs’ counsel made use of templates from prior cases to assist in drafting discovery and motions, the Court does not find that this justifies cutting the amount billed to half, especially when the particular entries challenged by Defendant do not appear unreasonable on its face.  However, the Court will reduce the amount of anticipated time to review and draft a reply to the motion, especially as the amount of estimated time for these entries provide that the time “will vary depending upon the complexity of the opposition brief” or notes that the estimated time is contingent on whether it is “necessary.” Plaintiffs’ reply brief does not address how much actual time was spent in reviewing the opposition and drafting the reply, nor do Plaintiffs provide whether a memorandum of costs was ever drafted or necessary. Further, the estimated time for “Misc. tasks to complete case, draft RFD and close file” is speculative. The Court reduces the hours sought for those “estimated” times from 6 hours to 3 hours total, which represents 2 hours to review the opposition and reply collectively, and 1 hour to attend the hearing on the fee motion at Kohen’s billing rate of $525.00 per hour. Thus, of the $42,900.00 in attorney fees requested by Law Offices of Isaac Kohen, the Court reduces the amount to $40,245.00 (comprised of Kohen’s reduced 62 hours billed at a $525/hour rate & Imbar’s 27 hours billed at the reduced $285/hour rate).  C. Multiplier While the lodestar reflects the basic fee for comparable legal services in the community, it may be adjusted based on various factors, including “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill displayed in presenting them; (2) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys; (3) the contingent nature of the fee award” and (4) the success achieved. (Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49.) Nonetheless, the court must not consider extraordinary skill and the other Serrano factors to the extent these are already included with the lodestar. (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal. 4th 1122, 1138-1139.) “[A] trial court should award a multiplier for exceptional representation only when the quality of representation far exceeds the quality of representation that would have been provided by an attorney of comparable skill and experience billing at the hourly rate used in the lodestar calculation. Otherwise, the fee award will result in unfair double counting and be unreasonable.” (Id. at 1139.) Plaintiffs request a lodestar multiplier enhancement of 1.1. The Court finds that a lodestar multiplier is not warranted here. Nothing before the Court indicates that the case presented novel issues or that the quality of representation far exceeded the quality of representation that would have been provided by attorneys of comparable skill and experience billing at the same rates. The¿contingent risks, skill, and difficulty¿Plaintiffs’ attorneys¿assert are absorbed by their hourly rates.¿(See¿Robertson v. Fleetwood Travel Trailers of California. Inc.¿(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 785, 822.) Accordingly, the Court declines to award a lodestar multiplier. D. Costs Allowable costs “shall be reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(2).) Any items not specifically mentioned by statute “may be allowed or denied in the court's discretion.” (Id., subd. (c)(4).) The Beverly-Song Act allows a successful plaintiff to recover both “costs” and “expenses.” (See Civ. Code, § 1794, subd. (d).) '“If the items appear to be proper charges the verified memorandum is prima facie evidence that the costs, expenses and services therein listed were necessarily incurred by the defendant [citations], and the burden of showing that an item is not properly chargeable or is unreasonable is upon the [objecting party].' [Citation.]” (Nelson v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 131.)¿ Plaintiffs request a total of $1,104.83 in costs. The cost items appear to be proper and Defendant did not challenge any costs. Therefore, Plaintiffs’ request for $1,104.83 in costs is granted.  IV. CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, Plaintiffs’ motion for attorney fees is GRANTED IN PART. The Court awards the Law Offices of Isaac $40,245.00 in attorney fees $1,104.83 in costs.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.  DATED: December 26, 2024 __________________________ Hon. Tiana J.
