The Complaint  Plaintiff Creative Circle, LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed this breach of contract action against defendants Quantasy & Associates LLC, Quantasy + Associates, Quantasy, LLC, and Does 1 to 20. The complaint alleges that on May 8, 2018, Plaintiff entered into a Temporary Staffing and Direct Hire Services Agreement with defendant Quantasy LLC, aka Quantasy. (Compl. ¶ 10; Exh. A.) Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, Plaintiff provided contract employees with Quantasy during the period of March 3, 2023 through October 16, 2023 and billed Quantasy for the time the contract employees worked at the hourly rate agreed upon. (Ibid.) On or about July 18, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a Temporary Staffing and Direct Hire Services Agreement with defendant Quantasy & Associates LLC. (Compl. ¶ 11; Exh. B.)   Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, Plaintiff contracted employees to Quantasy & Associates LLC during the period of October 16, 2023 through March 4, 2024 and billed Quantasy & Associates LLC for the time that the contract employees worked at the hourly rate agreed upon. (Ibid.) Defendants failed to pay the invoices sent from March 3, 2023 through March 4, 2024 in the amount of $117,851.00. (Compl. ¶¶ 12-15.) The complaint sets forth four causes of action for (1) breach of contract, (2) account stated, (3) book account, and (4) quantum meruit.   B. Default Judgment  Plaintiff has dismissed all unnamed Doe defendants. Plaintiff now seeks court judgment against Quantasy & Associates LLC, Quantasy + Associates, and Quantasy, LLC in the principal amount of $117,851.00, in addition to $553.80 for costs.  In support thereof, Plaintiff provides the declaration of its custodian of records, Christopher Coates (“Coates”). Coates declares that a true and correct copy of the correct balance due and unpaid to Plaintiff is set forth in Exhibit “C”. However, the Court notes that Exhibit “C” provides that the total amount due is $116,581.00, not $117,851.00. The Court is unclear as to where Plaintiff included an additional $1,270.00 in the request based on the evidence submitted.  Therefore, the principal amount of $116,581.00 shall be granted pursuant to the evidence proffered. Plaintiff’s costs in the amount of $553.80 for clerk’s filing fees and process server’s fees are allowable pursuant to CCP §1033.5(a) and therefore granted.  C. Conclusion  Plaintiff’s request for default judgment submitted on August 30, 2024 is GRANTED against Quantasy & Associates LLC, Quantasy + Associates, and Quantasy, LLC, jointly and severally, in the principal sum of $116,581.00, and $553.80 in costs.
