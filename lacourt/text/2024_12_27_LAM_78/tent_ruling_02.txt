 Case Number:  22STCV09372    Hearing Date:   December 27, 2024    Dept:  78  Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles Department 78 ¿ KEVIN VOONG, Plaintiff(s), vs. DAWN M. COULSON, ESQ., et al., Defendant(s). Case No.: 22STCV09372 Hearing Date: December 27, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING (1) MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL AND (2) MOTION TO COMPEL INITIAL DISCOVERY  I. BACKGROUND Plaintiff Kevin Voong (“Plaintiff”) initiated this legal malpractice action against defendants Dawn M. Coulson, Esq., EPPS & Coulson, LLP, and Does 1 through 10 arising from defendants’ representation of Plaintiff for collection of a judgment. The complaint sets forth two causes of action for legal malpractice/professional negligence and breach of fiduciary duty. On July 30, 2024, defendants Dawn M. Coulson, Esq. and EPPS & Coulson, LLP (collectively “Defendants”) filed a motion to compel Plaintiff to respond to special interrogatories, set one, and a request for monetary sanctions. On October 22, 2024, Defendants filed a motion to continue trial in order for their motion for summary judgment (“MSJ”) be heard at least 30 days prior to trial. Trial is currently set for January 21, 2025. The motions were initially set to be heard on December 2, 2024 and December 3, 2024. Due to the unavailability of the Court, the motions were continued to December 27, 2024. (Min. Order, Nov. 21, 2024.) As of December 13, 2024, no opposition to either of the two motions have been filed.  II. MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL Legal Standard Although continuances of trials are disfavored, each request for a continuance must be considered on its own merits. (CRC Rule 3.1332(c).) The Court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the continuance. (CRC Rule 3.1332(c).) The Court may look to the following factors in determining whether a trial continuance is warranted: (1) proximity of the trial date; (2) whether there was any previous continuance of trial due to any party; (3) the length of the continuance requested; (4) the availability of alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the motion; (5) the prejudice that parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance; and (6) whether trial counsel is engaged in another trial.¿(See generally, CRC Rule 3.1332(d)(1)-(11).) Additional factors for the Court to consider include: a party’s excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent efforts; whether all parties have stipulated to a continuance; and any other fact or circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the motion or application. (CRC Rule 3.1332(c), (d).) Discussion Here, there is good cause to continue the trial date. A MSJ shall be heard no later than 30 days before the trial date, unless the court for good cause orders otherwise. (CCP §437c(a)(3).) Defendants timely filed their MSJ on October 4, 2024, but it is set to be heard on January 8, 2025, which is less than 30 days prior to the current trial date. The trial court cannot refuse to hear a summary judgment motion filed within the time limits of CCP § 437c. (Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 918. 919.) Further, Defendants filed this motion to continue trial on October 22, 2024, which is three months before the current trial date as opposed to waiting until the eve of trial. There are no alternative means identified to address these issues, and there is otherwise no prejudice shown to any party if trial is continued, especially as no parties oppose the motion. While the Court will briefly continue the trial date to accommodate the MSJ, the Court denies Defendants’ additional request to continue all discovery related dates. The stated purpose of Defendants’ motion is so that its MSJ may be heard at least 30 days prior to trial pursuant to CCP §437c(a)(3). Defendants have not articulated any specific and necessary discovery yet uncompleted to justify the continuance of all discovery-related dates. Discovery and motion cut-off dates shall remain based on the January 21, 2025 trial date pursuant to the Court’s prior order. (Min. Order, June 3, 2024.) Conclusion & Order Based on the foregoing, Defendants’ motion to continue trial is GRANTED.¿ The January 21, 2025 trial date is continued to March 10, 2025 at 9:30 a.m. at 8:30 a.m. in Department 78 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse.¿The January 8, 2025 Final Status Conference is continued to  February 25, 2025 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 78 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse. All discovery and motion cutoff dates shall remain based on the January 21, 2025 trial date.  III. MOTION TO COMPEL INITIAL DISCOVERY Legal Standard For a motion to compel initial discovery responses, all a propounding party must show is that it properly served its discovery requests, that the time to respond has expired, and that the party to whom the requests were directed failed to provide a timely response. (See Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905 906.) Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may compel responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails to serve timely responses waives any objections to the request, including those based on privilege or the protection of attorney work product. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300, subd. (a).) Discussion Defendants propounded special interrogatories, set one, on Plaintiff on March 18, 2024. (Schneider Decl. ¶ 4; Exh. A.) Responses were due on or before April 19, 2024. (Id. at ¶ 5.) Defendants granted an extension to Plaintiff to respond to all discovery by May 15, 2024. (Ibid.) Plaintiff served responses to the other written discovery, but did not serve any responses to the special interrogatories, set one. (Ibid.) To date, Plaintiff has not served responses to the special interrogatories, set one. (Id. ¶ 7.) Defendants therefore seek an order compelling Plaintiff to respond, without objections, to the outstanding discovery and to pay sanctions. Plaintiff did not file any opposition to the motion demonstrating that discovery responses have been served. A failure to oppose a motion may be deemed a consent to the granting of the motion. (CRC, Rule 8.54(c).) Therefore, the unopposed motion -is granted. Defendants seek $1,235.00 in monetary sanctions for the motion. Sanctions are mandatory against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response, unless a court makes certain findings.¿(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290(c).) Plaintiff did not file any opposition. However, sanctions may be awarded, even though no opposition was filed, pursuant to CRC, Rule 3.1348(a).  A court has discretion to award sanctions that are “suitable and necessary to enable the party seeking discovery to obtain the objects of the discovery he seeks” but they should not be punitive in nature or levied for the purposes of punishing an offending party. (Vallbona v. Springer (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1525, 1545.)¿This is a simple and unopposed motion. The Court awards Defendants one hour to draft the motion and one hour to appear at the hearing at the requested and reasonable rate of $235.00 per hour, for a total of $470.00 as attorney fees. Further, Defendants are awarded the motion filing fee of $60.00 as costs. Conclusion & Order Defendants’ unopposed motion is therefore GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to serve verified responses to Defendants’ special interrogatories, set one, without objections, within fifteen (15) days. (CCP § 2030.290(a),(b).) Sanctions are imposed against Plaintiff and/or his counsel of record, jointly and severally. Plaintiff and/or his counsel are ordered to pay sanctions to Defendants, by and through counsel of record, in the total amount of $530.00, within thirty (30) days.  Moving Party is ordered to give notice.  DATED: December 26, 2024 __________________________ Hon.
