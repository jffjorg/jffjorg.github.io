ANALYSIS:
 
On June 30, 2023, Plaintiff Michael A. Younge (“Plaintiff”)
filed the instant action for breach of contract against Defendants Delecor
lnvestments, LLC and Jonathan DeLeon (“Defendants”). On June 10, 2024, the
parties discussed the status of the case and the Court set a status conference
re: arbitration for November 27, 2024. (Minute Order,06/10/24.) 
 
Plaintiff filed the instant Petition to Confirm Arbitration
Award on July 12, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
Legal Standard
 
This Petition relates to attorney-client fee arbitration under Code of
Civil Procedure section 6203. The “arbitration award shall become binding upon
the passage of 30 days after service of notice of the award, unless a party
has, within the 30 days, sought a trial after arbitration pursuant to Section
6204.” (Cal. Bus. & Profs. Code, § 6203, subd. (b).) The Award was served
on the parties by the arbitrator on July 1, 2024. (Pet., Attachment 2, p. 31.)
No trial after arbitration was sought by July 31, 2022. 
 
Confirmation of the arbitration award may be sought in the
manner provided in Code of Civil Procedure section 1285, et seq. “Any party to
an arbitration in which an award has been made may petition the court to
confirm, correct or vacate the award. 
The petition shall name as respondent all parties to the arbitration and
may name as respondents any other persons bound by the arbitration award.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.) “If a
petition or response under this chapter is duly served and filed, the court
shall confirm the award as made, whether rendered in this state or another
state, unless in accordance with this chapter it corrects the award and
confirms it as corrected, vacates the award or dismisses the proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1286.)
 
A response to a
Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award that seeks to vacate or correct the award
must be served and filed no later than 100 days after the date of the service
of a signed copy of the award on the respondent. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1288.2.)
 
Discussion
 
An arbitration award
is not directly enforceable until it is confirmed by a court and judgment is
entered.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1287.6; Jones
v. Kvistad (1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 836, 840.) The court must confirm the award
as made, unless it corrects or vacates the award, or dismisses the
proceeding.  (CCP § 1286; Valsan
Partners Limited Partnership v. Calcor Space Facility, Inc. (1994) 25
Cal.App.4th 809, 818.) Code of Civil Procedure, section 1285.4 states a
petition under this chapter shall:
 
a)     
Set forth the substance of or have attached a copy of
the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies the existence of such
an agreement.
 
b)     
Set forth the names of the arbitrators.
 
c)     
Set forth or have attached a copy of the award and the
written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.4.) The Petition complies with the
above requirements. It sets forth the nature of the arbitration agreement and
the name of the arbitrator. (Pet., ¶¶1, 6.) A copy of the arbitration agreement
is also attached. (Id. at Attachment 1.) Substantively, the Petition
demonstrates that Plaintiff is entitled to $16,028.28 plus arbitration fees of
$810.98. (Id. at Attachment 1, p. 30.) Plaintiff also seeks interest from
June 17, 2024 and costs of $735.00. (Id. at ¶10.) Costs and interest are
permitted pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1293.2 and Civil Code
section 3289, subdivision (b) and are awarded in the amount of $735.00 and ten
percent per annum from June 17, 2024. (Ibid.)
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Michael A. Younge’s Petition to Confirm
Arbitration Award is GRANTED IN THE AMOUNT OF $16,839.25 PRINCIPAL, $735.00
COSTS, AND INTEREST OF TEN (10) PERCENT PER ANNUM FROM JUNE 17, 2024. PLAINTIFF
