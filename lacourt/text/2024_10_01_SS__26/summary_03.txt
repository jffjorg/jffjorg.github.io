And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant Rita Cortez's motion to vacate the default and default judgment entered against her in the breach of contract case filed by Plaintiff Okorie Okorocha. The motion was timely and supported by a declaration explaining that Defendant did not receive actual notice of the action until June 2024. However, the motion was not accompanied by a copy of Defendant's proposed answer to the Complaint, as required by law. Therefore, the judge has granted the motion on the condition that Defendant submits a copy of her proposed responsive pleading by the time of the hearing.
