And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in plain English:

The judge has decided that the defendant's attempt to dismiss the plaintiff's lawsuit (a demurrer) is unwarranted. The plaintiff, Jose Estrada, is suing the defendant, Fan Shin Investment, LLC, under the Unruh Civil Rights Act because the restaurant's outdoor seating area is not wheelchair accessible. The judge has determined that the plaintiff's complaint meets the legal requirements and that the defendant's arguments against the complaint are unfounded. As a result, the judge is ordering the defendant to file and serve an answer to the complaint within 20 days.
