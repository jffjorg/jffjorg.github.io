And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff's motion for an order authorizing service on the Secretary of State is continued to January 7, 2025, at 10:00 am in Department 26 of the Spring Street Courthouse. The plaintiff must file a supplemental brief addressing the correct authority by December 10, 2024. Failure to do so may result in the motion being denied. The judge notes that the statute cited by the plaintiff, Corporations Code section 17701.16, applies to limited liability companies, but the defendant is a corporation and not subject to that statute. Therefore, the plaintiff must move for the requested relief pursuant to provisions of law that apply to corporations.
