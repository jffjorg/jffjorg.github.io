And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has placed the defendant's motion to strike portions of the complaint off the calendar. The defendant, Mariscos El Chaparrito, Inc., had moved to strike the plaintiff's request for attorney's fees, alleging that it did not meet the statutory requirements. The plaintiff, Mariscos Bahia, Inc., opposed the motion, pointing out that the defendant is a suspended corporation and therefore lacks standing to defend the action. The defendant replied, conceding its suspended status but claiming to be in the process of reviving itself. The judge has set a new hearing date for December 10, 2024, at 9:30 am, to allow the defendant to show cause why its motion to strike should not be denied.
