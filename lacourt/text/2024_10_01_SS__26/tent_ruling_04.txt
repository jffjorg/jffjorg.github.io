ANALYSIS:
 
On March 4, 2024, Plaintiff Mariscos Bahia, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed this action for breach of
contract and common counts against Defendants Mariscos El Chaparrito, Inc. (“Defendant El Chaparrito”) and John
Alvarez (“Defendant Alvarez”). Defendant Alvarez filed an answer on May 22,
2024. 
 
Defendant El Chaparrito filed the instant Motion to Strike
on June 4, 2024. Plaintiff filed an opposition on June 17, 2024 and Defendant
El Chaparrito replied on June 24, 2024. The Motion was set for hearing on June
27, 2024 but was then transferred to Department 26 in the Spring Street
Courthouse. (Minute Order, 06/27/24.) After the action was transferred,
Defendant El Chaparrito refiled the Motion and Plaintiff refiled its
opposition. 
 
Discussion
 
Defendant El Chaparrito bring the
instant Motion to Strike Plaintiff’s request for attorney’s fees pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 436. The Motion is accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 435.5.
(Motion, Grijalba Decl., ¶2 and Exh. A.) Defendant El Chaparrito moves to
strike request for attorney’s fees on the grounds that they do not meet the
statutory requirements. 
 
In opposition, Plaintiff points
out that Defendant El Chaparrito is a suspended corporation, and as such,
cannot defend this action. The Court takes judicial notice of the records of
the Secretary of State, pursuant to Plaintiff’s request under Evidence Code
sections 452 and 453. These records confirm Defendant El Chaparrito’s suspended
status as of June 17, 2024. (Opp., RJN, Exhs. A-B.) 
 
Defendant El Chaparrito’s reply
concedes that it is suspended but claims to be in the process of reviving
itself. However, since the Motion was brought on June 4, 2024, no papers have
been filed indicating any change in Defendant El Chaparrito’s status. To the
extent Defendant El Chaparrito seeks a continuance of the hearing date to
correct its corporate status, this hearing was already delayed by three months
after the case was transferred. Accordingly, the Court places the hearing on
the Motion to Strike off calendar. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Mariscos El Chaparrito, Inc.’s
Motion to Strike Portions of the Complaint is PLACED OFF CALENDAR. 
 
ORDER TO SHOW
