ANALYSIS:
 
On May 29, 2024, Plaintiff
Zhiwei Chen (“Plaintiff”), in propria persona, filed this action for property damage, fraud, and money laundering
against Defendant IDD (Int’l)
Investment, Inc. (“Defendant”).
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for Order Authorizing Service on Secretary
of State on July 8, 2024. To date, no opposition has been filed. 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff moves for an order authorizing service on
Defendant through the Secretary of State pursuant to Corporations Code section
17701.16, which states in relevant part:
 
If an agent for service of
process has resigned and has not been replaced or if the designated agent
cannot with reasonable diligence be found at the address designated for
personal delivery of the process, and it is shown by affidavit to the
satisfaction of the court that process against a limited liability company or
foreign limited liability company cannot be served with reasonable
diligence upon the designated agent by hand in the manner provided in Section
415.10, subdivision (a) of Section 415.20, or subdivision (a) of Section 415.30
of the Code of Civil Procedure, the court may make an order that the service
shall be made upon a domestic limited liability company or upon a registered
foreign limited liability company by delivering by hand to the Secretary of
State, or to any person employed in the Secretary of State's office in the
capacity of assistant or deputy, one copy of the process for each defendant to
be served, together with a copy of the order authorizing the service. Service
in this manner shall be deemed complete on the 10th day after delivery of the
process to the Secretary of State.
 
(Corp. Code, § 17701.16, subd. (c) [emphasis added].)
This statute, however, and entire relevant title, pertain to limited liablity
companies. Defendant is not a limited liabliity company, it is a corporation
and not subject to the moving statute. (Comp., p. 2:9-10.) Plaintiff must move
for the requested relief pursuant to provisions of law that apply to
corporations.
