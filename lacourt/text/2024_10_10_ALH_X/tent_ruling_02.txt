Each answer in the response to written discovery must be “as
complete and straightforward as the information reasonably available to the
responding party permits. [¶] . . . If an interrogatory cannot be answered
completely, it shall be answered to the extent possible.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.220, subd. (a), (b).)
 Where the question is specific and
explicit, an answer that supplies only a portion of the information sought is
improper.  It is also improper to provide
“deftly worded conclusionary answers designed to evade a series of explicit
questions.”  (Deyo v. Kilbourne
(1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 783.)  Furthermore,
where an interrogatory asks for the names of all witnesses to a particular
event then known to the responding party, a response omitting the name of a
known witness could subject the adversary to unfair surprise at trial and
therefore may result in an order excluding that witness’ testimony.  (R & B Auto Ctr., Inc. v. Farmers
Group, Inc. (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 327, 356.)
 
In
addition, Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310, subdivision (a) provides:
 
On
receipt of a response to a demand for inspection . . . , the demanding party
may move for an order compelling further response to the demand if the
demanding party deems that any of the following apply:
 
(1) A statement of compliance with the
demand is incomplete. 
(2) A representation of inability to
comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive. 
(3) An objection in the response is
without merit or too general.
 
As Plaintiff’s responses to the subject discovery appear
incomplete and are unverified, Plaintiff is ordered to provide verified
further Code-compliant responses within 20 days of mailing of the Court’s
notice of ruling.
 
Defendants
request sanctions in the amount of $1,500 for each of the two motions ONLY IF
Plaintiff fails to provide a verification for the previously served responses
and further verified responses. 
Accordingly, the Court defers ruling on Defendants’ request for sanctions.Moving parties are to give notice.
