And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to deem requests for admission (RFAs) admitted against defendants Mile High Cure Corp and Jeremy Caldwell, as well as the defendant's answer and cross-complaint. The plaintiff has moved for an order that the truth of the matters specified in the RFAs be deemed admitted against the defendants, citing Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (b).

The court notes that a substitution of attorney has been filed as to Defendant Mile High Cure Corp, but not as to Cross-Complainant Mile High Cure Corp. The plaintiff served RFAs on December 6, 2023, and responses were due January 8, 2024. However, the defendants failed to produce responses as of August 27, 2024.

The court grants the plaintiff's motion to deem RFAs admitted against Mile High Cure Corp, but denies the motion as moot against Jeremy Caldwell, as Caldwell has served objection-free responses prior to the hearing on this motion. The court also grants the plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $598.50 against Mile High Cure Corp and Jeremy Caldwell, payable within 30 days of mailing of a notice of ruling.

The court also orders the documents which are the subject of the requests for genuineness of documents to be deemed genuine. Finally, the court notes that Plaintiff's Motion (4) to Deem RFAs Admitted and Order to Show Cause Hearing re: Striking Defendant Mile High's Answer and Cross-Complaint will remain on calendar.
