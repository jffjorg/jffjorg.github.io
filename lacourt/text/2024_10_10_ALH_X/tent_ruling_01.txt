  Case Number:  22AHCV00356    Hearing Date:   October 10, 2024    Dept:  X Plaintiff’s Motion (4) to Deem RFAs Admitted and Order to Show Cause Hearing Order to Show Cause Hearing re: Striking Defendant Mile High’s Answer and Cross-Complaint The Court notes that a substitution of attorney has been filed as to Defendant Mile High Cure Corp.  However, no substitution of attorney has been filed on behalf of Cross-Complainant Mile High Cure Corp.  In the absence of any such substitution filed prior to the OSC hearing, the latter will remain on calendar.  Plaintiff’s
Motions (4) to Deem RFAs Admitted; Requests for Sanctions Plaintiff moves for an
order that the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission be
deemed admitted against Defendants Mile High and Jeremy Caldwell.   Code of Civil Procedure
section 2033.280, subdivision (b), provides that if a party fails to respond to
a request for admission, “[t]he requesting party may move for an order
that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in
the requests be deemed admitted”.  Unless the court determines that
the responding party “has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed
response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with
Section 2033.220, it must order the RFAs deemed admitted… But a responding
party’s service, prior to the hearing on the ‘deemed admitted’ motion, of
substantially compliant responses, will defeat a propounding party’s attempt
under section 2033.280 to have the RFAs deemed admitted.”  (St.
Mary v. Superior Court (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 775–776, citations
and footnote omitted.) Each of Plaintiff’s four
motions is supported by the following facts: On December 6, 2023, Plaintiff
served (1) Requests for Admission, Set One—Caldwell; (2) Requests for Admission
of Genuineness of Documents, Set One—Caldwell; (3) Requests for Admission, Set
One—Mile High; and (4) Requests for Admission of Genuineness of Documents, Set
One—Mile High. (Motion (6681) Liberzon Decl., ¶ 4, Exh. 1; Motion (0774)
Liberzon Decl., ¶ 4, Exh. 1; Motion (9490) Liberzon Decl., ¶ 4, Exh. 1; Motion
(6972) Liberzon Decl.,  4, Exh. 1.)  Responses were due January 8, 2024.  Plaintiff provided at least three extensions
to Mile High and Caldwell.  (Motion
(6681) Liberzon Decl., ¶¶ 5-6; Motion (0774) Liberzon Decl., ¶¶ 5-6; Motion
(9490) Liberzon Decl., ¶¶ 5-6; Motion (6972) Liberzon Decl., 5-6.)  Plaintiff provides that Caldwell and Mile High
failed to produce any responses as of the filing of these four motions (August
27, 2024).  (Motion (6681) Liberzon
Decl., ¶ 7; Motion (0774) Liberzon Decl., ¶ 7; Motion (9490) Liberzon Decl., ¶
7; Motion (6972) Liberzon Decl., 7.) Motion
re: Admissions to Defendant Mile High (No. 6972)

In opposition, Defendant Mile High provides it served objection-free responses
on October 7, 2024.  (Murrin Decl., ¶ 4.)  Because
Defendant has served responses prior to the hearing on this motion, Plaintiff’s
motion to deem admitted is denied as moot.  However, due to the necessity
in having to file the instant motion to secure responses, Plaintiff’s request
for sanctions in the amount of $598.50 is granted.  Sanctions are
payable by Defendant Mile High to Plaintiff’s counsel and due within 30 days of
mailing of a notice of ruling. Motion
re: Genuineness of Documents to Defendant Mile High (No. 6681) There is no written
opposition to Motion No. 6681.  Plaintiff’s
motion is granted and the documents which are the subject of these requests are
deemed genuine.  Plaintiff’s request for sanctions in the amount of
$598.50 is granted.  Sanctions are payable by Defendant Mile High to
Plaintiff’s counsel and due within 30 days of mailing of a notice of ruling. Motion
re: Admissions to Defendant Jeremy Caldwell (No. 9490) In the opposition to the
motion to deem RFAs admitted against Caldwell (9490), Defendant provides it
served responses on September 4, 2024.  (Caldwell
Decl., ¶ 4.)  Because Defendant has
served responses prior to the hearing on this motion, Plaintiff’s motion is
denied as moot.  However, due to the
necessity in having to file the instant motion to secure responses, Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions in the amount of $598.50 is granted.  Sanctions
are payable by Defendant Caldwell to Plaintiff’s counsel and due within 30 days
of mailing of a notice of ruling. Motion
re: Genuineness of Documents to Defendant Jeremy Caldwell (No. 0774) There is no written
opposition to Motion No. 0774.  Plaintiff’s
motion is granted and the documents which are the subject of these requests are
deemed genuine.  Plaintiff’s request for sanctions in the amount of
$598.50 is granted.  Sanctions are payable by Defendant Caldwell to
Plaintiff’s counsel and due within 30 days of mailing of a notice of ruling.
