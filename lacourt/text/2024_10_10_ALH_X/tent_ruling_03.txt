failure to serve the complaint and $250 for Plaintiff’s failure to appear on
May 8, 2024.  There were no appearances.  The Court ordered the

On
August 15, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel filed a motion to set aside the dismissal
based on the grounds of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.  Plaintiff’s counsel failed to attend the Order
to Show Cause for Failure to File Proof of Service hearing set on May 8, 2024,
because Plaintiff’s counsel moved from Irvine to Santa Ana in the month of
April.  (Hatch Decl., ¶ 7.)  A notice of
change of address was filed on May 2024.  (Hatch Decl., ¶ 7.) 
 
Plaintiff’s
counsel declares that on or about March 13, 2024, Plaintiff attempted to serve
Defendant at 12769 7th Street, in Chino, California and after one attempt the
process server spoke with resident Johnathan Rodriguez who said Defendant moved
to 14406 Aztec St., Sylmar, CA 91342.  (Hatch
Decl., ¶ 4, Exh. 3 [Non-Service Report].)  On March 27 and April 6, 2024, Plaintiff
attempted to serve Defendant five and seven times, respectfully.  (Hatch Decl., ¶¶ 5-6.) 
The attempts to serve by publication resulted in publication dates of
July 19, July 25, August 1, and August 8, 2024.  (Hatch Decl., ¶ 8; Exh. 7.)  Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473, Plaintiff requests that
the Court set aside the dismissal on July 17, 2024. 
 
The motion is timely
as it was filed on August 15, 2024, which is within six months of the dismissal
on July 17, 2024.  The Court finds
Plaintiff has met her burden under section 473(b) of showing that the dismissal
was caused by her attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, and neglect.  Relief is
mandatory.
 
The motion is,
therefore. GRANTED.
