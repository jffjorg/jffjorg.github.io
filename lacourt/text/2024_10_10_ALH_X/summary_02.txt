And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motions to compel further responses to special interrogatories and production demands. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to provide verified and complete responses within 20 days of the notice of ruling. The judge has also deferred ruling on the defendants' request for sanctions in the amount of $1,500.

The judge has granted the defendants' motions as to the following:

* Special interrogatories from Officers Zamora, Sandoval, Gutierrez, and Carrillo: Granted as to certain interrogatories.
* Production demand requests from Officers Zamora, Sandoval, Gutierrez, and Carrillo: Granted as to certain requests.
* Special interrogatories from the City: Granted as to certain interrogatories.
* Production demand requests from the City: Granted as to certain requests.

The judge has also ordered the plaintiff to provide verified further Code-compliant responses within 20 days of mailing of the Court's notice of ruling.

The judge's ruling is based on the fact that the plaintiff's responses to written discovery appear incomplete and unverified. The judge has stated that the plaintiff's responses must be "as complete and straightforward as the information reasonably available to the responding party permits." The judge has also cited several California court cases to support the ruling.
