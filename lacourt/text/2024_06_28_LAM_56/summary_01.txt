And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses two motions filed by the Plaintiff, Roie Maor, to deem facts admitted and the genuineness of documents established. The motions are unopposed, and the Plaintiff served requests for admission and genuineness of documents on the Defendant, Eve M. Aron, but the Defendant failed to respond. Pursuant to California Code of Procedure § 2033.280, the court grants the motions and deems the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission as admitted and the genuineness of the documents established. No sanctions are imposed since no request was made in the motions. The Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
