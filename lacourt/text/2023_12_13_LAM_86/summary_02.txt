And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a petition for a hearing before the Commission. The petition raises legal issues regarding the jurisdiction of the Commission to consider an appeal. The judge notes that the standard of review is the same under administrative and traditional mandate, and the court does not need to address the County's position that the petition is governed by Code of Civil Procedure section 1085. The judge takes judicial notice of the Rules and quotes Rule 11.05 for context. The judge finds that the Commission is not required to grant a hearing request and that the County's interpretation of the relevant rules renders Rule 6.07 "surplusage". The judge also notes that the language in Monsivaiz v. Los Angeles County Civil Service Com. indicating the jurisdiction of the Commission is limited to claims of discrimination and appeals related to discharges and reductions is dicta. The judge is skeptical of how the Commission could fashion an appropriate remedy in this case, as the Petitioner has taken a new position in a different department with the County and the examination at issue has long since closed.
