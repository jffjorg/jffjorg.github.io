And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Petitioner Lisa Frame's petition for writ of mandate, which sought to overturn a decision made by the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). The petition was filed on November 8, 2022, and was denied due to Petitioner's failure to meet her burden of proof. Specifically, Petitioner failed to file an opening brief and lodge a certified administrative record with the court, as ordered. The judge found that Petitioner's failure to provide this information meant that she had not overcome the presumption of regularity contained in Evidence Code section 664. The judge also noted that Petitioner's failure to file a memorandum in support of her petition was a factor in the denial of the petition. The judge concluded that Petitioner had not demonstrated error by the DMV, and therefore the petition was denied.
