**Case Information**

* Case Number: 23STCP02378
* Hearing Date: December 13, 2023
* Department: 86
* Parties:
	+ Plaintiff: Alliance for Constitutional Sex Offense Laws, Inc.
	+ Defendant: Jeff Macomber, Secretary of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR)
	+ Other parties: Christopher Sandahl, Joshua Morales, Alexander Flores, John Doe #1, and John Doe #2

**Facts**

* The five individual petitioners are parolees subject to the jurisdiction of the CDCR.
* The petitioners contend that CDCR's regulations, policies, and practices are inconsistent with and in conflict with the statutory requirements of the "Containment Model" of parole supervision codified in Penal Code section 3008.
* The petition alleges that CDCR's regulations and policies do not allow registrants to complete and discontinue the sex offender management program prior to discharge from parole, despite the statutory requirement that they must have the opportunity to complete the program.

**Intentions**

* The petitioners seek a writ of mandate directing the respondent to amend and revise its regulations implementing Penal Code section 3008(d) to permit registrants to complete and terminate their participation in the sex offender management program prior to discharge from parole.
* The petitioners also seek declaratory relief, declaring that Penal Code section 3008(d) prohibits CDCR from retaining all registrants in a sex offender management program for the entire term of parole.

**Disputes**

* The respondent argues that the petitioners have not stated a cause of action for mandate and that the petition is uncertain and ambiguous.
* The respondent also argues that the petitioners have an adequate legal remedy through a petition for writ of habeas corpus and that the petition should be dismissed.

**Acts**

* The respondent has demurred to the petition, arguing that it is insufficient and that the petitioners have not stated a cause of action for mandate or declaratory relief.

**Laws**

* Penal Code section 3008(d)
* Government Code section 11350, subdivision (a)

**Roles**

* Judge: Mitchell Beckloff
* Parties: Alliance for Constitutional Sex Offense Laws, Inc., Jeff Macomber, Secretary of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR), Christopher Sandahl, Joshua Morales, Alexander Flores, John Doe #1, and John Doe #2
* Counsel: Respondent's counsel (Heinisch Decl.)

**Significant Statements**

* The petition is partly based on an alleged conflict between Section 3573 and Penal Code section 3008, subdivision (d).
* The petition alleges that CDCR's regulations, policies, and practices conflict with the controlling statutes, including Penal Code section 3008, subdivision (d).
* The respondent has not demonstrated that the petitioners have an adequate legal remedy through a petition for writ of habeas corpus.
* The respondent's demurrer for uncertainty is unpersuasive because the use of fictitious names for two of the petitioners does not render the pleading uncertain.
* The court declines to consider the new reply arguments raised by the respondent because they were not raised in the demurrer and the petitioners have not had a full and fair opportunity to respond in writing to the arguments.
