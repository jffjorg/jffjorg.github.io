And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has ruled that Plaintiff Ebony Tay's motions to compel Defendant The Neiman Marcus Group, Inc. to serve further responses to special interrogatories and requests for admission are denied. The Judge's decision is based on the fact that the parties failed to comply with the requirement to attend an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) before filing the motions. Although the parties attended an IDC on August 19, 2024, the topics listed in the IDC form did not include the special interrogatories and requests for admission that are the subject of the current motions. The Judge also notes that it does not recall waiving the IDC requirement, which would violate the Court's Eighth Amended Standing Order.
