Summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Syed Sobhan v. Mabel Ma, granting the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant's responses to special interrogatories and form interrogatories. The court orders the defendant to serve verified code-compliant responses to the special interrogatories and form interrogatories without objections by January 23, 2025. The court also grants the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant's responses to requests for admission, but denies the plaintiff's request to deem admitted matters specified in the requests for admission.

The court finds that the defendant failed to serve timely responses to the discovery requests, waiving any objections to the discovery requests. The court also finds that the defendant's counsel acted without substantial justification and orders the defendant and her counsel to pay the plaintiff $1,500.00 in sanctions.
