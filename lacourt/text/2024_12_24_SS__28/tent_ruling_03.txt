Plaintiff
asks the Court (1) to compel Defendant’s responses to special interrogatories,
set one, (2) to compel Defendant’s responses to form interrogatories, set one,
and (3) to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission, set one.  Plaintiff also asks the Court to impose

LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Interrogatories 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides:         
“If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails
to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may
move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition
of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that
sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290.) 
          B.  Requests for
admission 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2033.280 provides: 
“If a party to whom requests for admission are
directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the requests for admission are
directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its
determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The requesting party may move
for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters
specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(c) The court shall make this order, unless it finds
that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with
Section 2033.220. It is mandatory that the court
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to
requests for admission necessitated this motion.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280.) 
DISCUSSION 
On July 29, 2024, Plaintiff served special interrogatories,
set one, form interrogatories, set one, and requests for admission, set one, on
Defendant.  Defendant did not serve timely responses and
had not served responses by the time Plaintiff filed these motions on October 31,
2024. 
Defendant opposes the motions, stating (1) Defendant’s
counsel could not locate Defendant, (2) after making diligent efforts to locate
Defendant, Defendant’s counsel contacted Defendant on December 9, 2024, and (3)
on December 10, 2024, Defendant served verified responses to the discovery
requests.  Defendant has not included copies of the discovery responses
in her opposition papers. 
Plaintiff argues that, even though Defendant waived
any objections to the discovery requests by failing to serve timely responses,
Defendant’s late responses contain objections. 
Plaintiff asks the Court to compel Defendant to provide responses to the
special interrogatories, form interrogatories, and requests for admission
without objections. 
“If a party fails to serve a timely response to
interrogatories, then under [Code of Civil Procedure] section 2030.290,
subdivision (a), it waives all objections and the burden shifts to that party
to demonstrate that it is entitled to relief from the waiver.”  (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.
Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 407 (Sinaiko).)
 “Under section 2030.290, therefore, once
a party has failed to serve timely interrogatory responses, the trial court has
the authority to hear a propounding party’s motion to compel responses under
section 2030.290, subdivision (b), regardless of whether a party serves an untimely
response.  If a party fails to serve a
timely response to interrogatories, then by operation of law, all objections
that it could assert to those interrogatories are waived.  [Citation.] 
Unless that party obtains relief from its waiver, the propounding party
is entitled to move under subdivision (b) for an order compelling the response
to which the propounding party is entitled – that is, a response without
objection, and that substantially complies with the provisions governing the
form [citation] and completeness [citation] of interrogatory responses.”  (Id. at p. 408.) 
Based on the reasoning of Sinaiko, the Court
grants Plaintiff’s motions to compel Defendant's responses to special interrogatories and
form interrogatories.  The Court orders
Defendant to serve verified code-compliant responses to the special
interrogatories and form interrogatories without objections by January 23,
2025. 
Plaintiff has not argued or shown that
Defendant’s late responses to requests for admission are not “in substantial
compliance with [Code of Civil Procedure] Section 2033.220.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (c).)  Therefore, the
Court denies Plaintiff’s motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests
for admission under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (c).  If Plaintiff believes that Defendant’s
responses to the requests for admission are deficient, Plaintiff may move to
compel further responses in compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section
2033.290. 
Plaintiff requests sanctions based on the motions to
compel responses to special interrogatories and form interrogatories.  Defendant asks the Court to refrain from
opposing sanctions because Defendant’s counsel acted diligently to locate her.  The Court finds that Defendant did not act with
substantial justification and no other circumstances make the imposition
of sanctions unjust.  Defendant was aware
of the litigation and chose to avoid contact with her counsel.  In addition, Defendant's counsel should have known that Defendant had waived any objections to the discovery requests.  Defendant's counsel nonetheless included objections in Defendant's late discovery responses. 
Plaintiff requests $1,050.00 in
sanctions on each motion to compel interrogatory responses based on three hours
of attorney time at a rate of $350.00 per hour. 
Counsel spent one hour preparing the moving papers and anticipated
spending one hour to review the opposition papers and prepare a reply and one hour
to prepare for and attend the hearing. 
The Court grants Plaintiff $750.00 in sanctions based on three hours of
attorney time at a reasonable rate of $250.00 per hour for both motions to
compel responses to interrogatories (that is, $375.00 for each motion to
compel).   
“It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or
attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for
admission necessitated [a] motion” under Code of Civil Procedure section
2033.280, subdivision (b).  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  Plaintiff
requests $1,050.00 in sanctions based on three hours of attorney time at a rate
of $350.00 per hour.  Counsel spent one
hour preparing the moving papers and anticipated spending one hour to review
the opposition papers and prepare a reply and one hour to prepare for and
attend the hearing.  The Court grants
Plaintiff $750.00 in sanctions based on three hours of attorney time at a
reasonable rate of $250.00 per hour. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff Syed Sobhan’s
motion to compel Defendant Mabel Ma’s responses
to special interrogatories, set one.  The Court orders Defendant Mabel
Ma to serve verified code-compliant responses to the special interrogatories
without objections by January 23, 2025. 
The Court
GRANTS Plaintiff Syed Sobhan’s motion to compel Defendant Mabel Ma’s responses
to form interrogatories, set one.  The
Court orders Defendant Mabel Ma to serve verified code-compliant responses to
the form interrogatories without objections by January 23, 2025. 
The Court
DENIES Plaintiff Syed Sobhan’s motion to deem admitted requests for
admission, set one, served on Defendant Mabel Ma. 
The Court
GRANTS in part Plaintiff Syed Sobhan’s requests for sanctions and orders Defendant Mabel
Ma and her counsel to pay Plaintiff
Syed Sobhan $1,500.00 ($750.00 plus $750.00) by January 23, 2025.  In all other respects, the Court DENIES the sanctions requests.
