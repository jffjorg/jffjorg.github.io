The Court has reviewed the deposition notices and notes that Defendant was aware of the deposition schedule since March 2022. The Court has seen a pattern of Defendant objecting to Plaintiff's deposition notice, then agreeing to the deposition, and then canceling at the last minute. The Court has awarded sanctions in the amount of $2,105 to Plaintiff. The Court has ordered Defendant to appear for his deposition on a mutually agreed upon date, time, and place, no later than January 7, 2024.
