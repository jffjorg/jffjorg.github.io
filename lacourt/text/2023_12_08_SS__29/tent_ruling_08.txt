 Case Number:  21STCV46280    Hearing Date:   December 8, 2023    Dept:  29 Tentative
The motion to be relieved as counsel is
GRANTED.
Background
On December 20, 2021, Jody Swafford filed a
complaint relating to a slip and fall incident on March 15, 2021, involving
Defendants County of Los Angeles, Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority,
State of California, Sportmen’s Lodge Owner, LLC, Midwood Management Corp., and
Does 1 through 100.
On October 4, 2023, Shaun Joseph Bauman filed
a motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff. No opposition has been filed.
On November 2, 2023, the hearing for this motion was continued to December 8,
2023. Plaintiff was ordered to give notice. No notice has been filed with the
Court.
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
Counsel has
filed the requisite forms pursuant to CRC Rule 3.1362. Counsel has served the
forms on Plaintiff as well as the other parties in this matter. Counsel
declares that the attorney-client relationship between all Plaintiffs and
counsel has broken down, significantly impeding counsels’ ability to prosecute
the matter. (MC-052, no. 2.)  
Accordingly, all
substantive and procedural requirements for the motion are satisfied, and the motion is GRANTED.
Conclusion
The motion to be
relieved as counsel is GRANTED. 
The order is
effective upon the filing with the Court of a proof of service showing service
of the order on Plaintiff.
Moving party to
give notice.
