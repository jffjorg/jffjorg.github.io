And here is the English text summary:

This tentative ruling grants the motion to continue the trial, which is currently set for January 11, 2024. The motion was filed by the plaintiff, James Cody Williams, who seeks to continue the trial due to the lack of evidence, specifically the video evidence, which has not been made available to him despite his efforts to request it. The defendants, Colloff, Fishman & Britt Casting, Inc., 4322 Wilshire, LLC, Jamison Properties, Inc., Jamison Services, Inc., Anya Colloff, and Does 1 to 100, opposed the motion, arguing that the plaintiff has failed to engage in the mandatory settlement conference and that the video evidence is not in their possession. The court finds that the plaintiff has established good cause for continuing the trial and grants the motion, continuing the trial date to mid-April 2024.
