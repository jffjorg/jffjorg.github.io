And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has granted Plaintiff Luis Sanchez's motion to compel Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority's deposition and production of documents. The judge finds that Defendant has refused to produce a witness for deposition and has not provided a justification for this refusal. The judge concludes that Plaintiff is entitled to discover information relating to the person most qualified to testify to the video footage, policies and procedures relating to the downloading, retention, and storage of bus video footage, and the DVR download of the footage. The judge orders Defendant to produce a witness for deposition and documents within 30 days.

The judge also grants Plaintiff's request for sanctions in part, ordering Defendant and counsel to pay monetary sanctions to Plaintiff in the amount of $2,320 within 30 days. This amount includes 4.5 hours of attorney time at a reasonable hourly rate of $300 per hour, plus the expense of $970 actually and reasonably incurred by Plaintiff in connection with the non-appearance of Defendant.
