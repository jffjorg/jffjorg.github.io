And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion to continue the trial due to good cause. The case arises from a slip and fall incident that occurred on April 18, 2021, between the plaintiff, Charles Turner, and the defendants, the City of Los Angeles and Los Angeles World Airports. The plaintiff filed a complaint on February 8, 2022, alleging causes of action for general negligence and premise liability against the defendants.

The defendants filed a motion to continue the trial on November 8, 2023, and the plaintiff filed an opposition on November 27, 2023. The defendants filed a reply on December 1, 2023. The trial was set for February 8, 2024.

The judge finds that the defendants have established good cause for continuing the trial. The defendants have timely filed a motion for summary judgment, and they have a right to have the motion heard. The motion must be heard at least 30 days before the trial date, and the earliest available hearing date was January 8, 2025, which is after the trial date of February 8, 2024.

The judge also finds that the plaintiff has not specifically stated how he would be impacted by the delay, only that justice would be delayed. The judge does not have available capacity to advance the hearing date to March 2024, as the plaintiff requests.

Accordingly, the judge grants the motion to continue the trial, and the trial is continued to late March 2025. The final status conference and all deadlines are reset based on the new trial date.
