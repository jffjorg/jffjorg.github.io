And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to continue the trial, which was set for March 13, 2024. The motion was filed on November 9, 2023, and the defendant argued that they need more time to conduct examinations of the plaintiffs, which are scheduled to be heard on February 20, 2024, just before the discovery deadline. The plaintiffs opposed the motion, citing the defendant's lack of diligence in seeking a psychological examination and arguing that they are entitled to a trial preference under California Code of Civil Procedure section 36(b). The Judge finds that the defendant has established good cause for the continuance and grants the motion, continuing the trial to late June 2024.
