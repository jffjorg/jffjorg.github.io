And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel Savage X Fenty (the employer of the plaintiff, Jenna Suhl) to comply with a subpoena issued on July 13, 2022. The reason for this denial is that the plaintiff had previously moved to quash the subpoena and the court granted that motion on April 19, 2023. As a result, the motion to compel compliance with the 2022 subpoena is now moot. The judge notes that the court will not order a third party to comply with a subpoena that has been quashed. If the defendant wishes to compel compliance with a new subpoena, a new motion must be filed and both parties must be properly served.
