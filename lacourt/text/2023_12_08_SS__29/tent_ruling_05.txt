 Case Number:  21STCV32240    Hearing Date:   December 8, 2023    Dept:  29 Tentative
The motion to compel Savage X Fenty to comply
with the subpoena issued on or about July 13, 2022 (motion filed on 2/24/23) is
DENIED as moot.
Discussion
On August 31, 2021, Plaintiff Jenna Suhl
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendant Rayane Laoubi (“Defendant”)
and Does 1 through 20 for negligence arising out of a vehicle collision that
occurred on October 9, 2019, on Arbor Vitae Street in Inglewood, California.
Plaintiff alleged damages include a claim for “loss of earnings and earning
capacity, both past and future, in amounts according to proof.” (Complaint, ¶
11.) 
 
In discovery, Plaintiff stated that she
was seeking to recover (among other damages) $60,000 in lost wages from her job
at her former employer Savage Fenty (“Employer”). (Motion, 1:24-26.) 
 
On or about July 13, 2022, Defendant
issued a subpoena to Employer seeking “any and all documents and records
pertaining to the employment and earnings” of Plaintiff (the “2022 Subpoena”). (Capabianco
Decl., ¶ 6.) 
 
On February 24, 2023, Defendant moved for
an order compelling Employer to comply with the 2022 Subpoena.  The hearing was scheduled for November 13,
2023 (later continued to December 8, 2023).
 
In the interim, Plaintiff moved to quash
the 2022 Subpoena.  The Court granted
that motion on April 19, 2023.
 
Defendant issued a narrow subpoena to
Employer on or about May 30, 2023 (the “2023 Subpoena”).  Plaintiff moved to quash the 2023
Subpoena.  The Court denied that motion
on August 11, 2023.
 
Now the hearing on the motion filed by
Defendant for an order compelling Employer to comply with the 2022 Subpoena
comes before the Court.  As the Court has
granted Plaintiff’s motion to quash the 2022 Subpoena, Defendant’s motion is
DENIED as moot.  The Court will not order
a third party to comply with a subpoena that has been quashed.
 
In denying the motion for an order compelling
compliance with the 2022 Subpoena, the Court expresses no views on any motion for
an order compelling compliance with the 2023 Subpoena (other than to note that
the Court denied Plaintiff’s motion to quash that subpoena).  If Defendant seeks such an order, a new
motion must be filed, and both Plaintiff and the subpoenaed party must be
properly served.
 
Conclusion
The motion to compel Savage X Fenty to comply
with the subpoena issued on or about July 13, 2022 (motion filed on 2/24/23) is
DENIED as moot.
