  Case Number:  23VECV01101    Hearing Date:   April 23, 2024    Dept:  T 23VECV01101 Lovegren v Torres
Tentative ruling: Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further responses to RFP Set
#1, No. 7 ( REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 7: All DOCUMENTS RELATING TO complaints
made by OTHER TENANTS RELATING TO the PROPERTY from January 1, 2015, to the
present.)
The motion is timely as it was filed within 45 days plus two court days of
service of the responses by email.
The court GRANTS the motion in part and orders a further verified Code
Compliant response to No. 7 which uses the statutory language as to whether
there are any responsive documents ONLY GOING BACK TO 1/1/2019 for
tenant not previously in the same unit and back to 1/1/2017 for tenants who
previously lived in the same unit as plaintiff, whether
defendants have them in their possession, custody or control, or no longer have
them because they have been lost or destroyed, or whether they are in the
possession of others and whom; and to provide a Code Compliant privilege
log.  Names can be redacted.  Once
this is done, plaintiff can then conduct meet and confer to determine whether
an additional motion to compel should be filed if documents are not produced. 
Because the responses are not Code Compliant, which is discovery abuse, and
because there was no timely opposition filed nor any explanation why there
was no opposition, the court grants monetary sanctions against defendants EQR
Lindley LP and Equity Residential Management LLC.  However, the amount claimed is very
excessive and unwarranted for this simplest of motions.  The declaration indicates 2.6 hours by the
attorney and 7.1 hours by the paralegal. 
The motion concerned only 1 request for production response.  It is not credible that moving party would also
suggest 5 hours to review the opposition and prepare a reply.  The court will assess the reasonable
amount fees for 3 hours at $400 per hour (there was no explanation as to the
basis for the $450 per hours, no explanation for the education or training, or
experience of the attorney) for a total of $1,200 for discovery abuse without
substantial justification/failure to provide Code compliant response, pursuant
to CCP section  2023.010 and 2031.300,
payable by defendants EQR Lindley LP and Equity Residential Management LLC, and
their counsel, Prindle, Goetz, Barnes & Reinholz LLP, jointly and severally,
to the Client Trust Account of Tenant Law Group, PC, 100 Pine St., Suite 1250,
San Francisco, CA 94111 by 5/22/2024.
IT IS SO ORDERED. CLERK TO GIVE NOTICE.
