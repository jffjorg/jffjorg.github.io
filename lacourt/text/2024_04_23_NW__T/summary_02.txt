And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling is in response to Plaintiff Ally Bank's application for a writ of possession against Defendant Oleg Dombrovsky. The Court finds that the Plaintiff has shown the probable validity of their claim and right to repossess a vehicle from the Defendant. The Defendant was properly served with the summons and complaint, and the Plaintiff provided evidence of the breach of the Retail Installment Sales Contract and the damages incurred. The Court finds that the Defendant's refusal to surrender the vehicle is unjust and grants the Plaintiff's application for a writ of possession. The Court also waives the requirement for the Plaintiff to post an undertaking.
