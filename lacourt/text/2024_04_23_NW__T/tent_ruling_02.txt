An  opposition was due on April 10, 2024 and none was filed. Discussion  Plaintiff’s  proof of service showed that Defendant was properly served with the summons and  complaint and properly notified of the hearing on the application.  (Code Civ. Proc. sec. 512.010.)   Plaintiff  provided a declaration to show the probable validity of their claim and right  to repossess the vehicle from Defendant because Plaintiff provided evidence  showing: Defendant’s entry into the Retail Installment Sales Contract (RISC)  for the vehicle; Plaintiff assignor’s performance of delivery of the vehicle;  Defendant’s breach in failing to pay; and Plaintiff’s damages.  (Code Civ. Proc sec. 512.040.)  (James Singleton Decl. pars. 5-8.)  Plaintiff further provided that the vehicle  is in the custody and control of Defendant and located at Defendant’s  residence.  (Singleton Decl. par.  10.)  (Code Civ. Proc. sec.  512.060.)  With Defendant’s breach,  Defendant no longer has rights to possess and further refused to surrender the  vehicle.  Plaintiff has shown their  rights to possession.  No bond is  required.   Plaintiff  submitted the amount owed on the account and the value of the vehicle.  (Singleton Decl. pars. 6-7.)  The evidence showed that the account balance  exceeds the value of the vehicle, and no equity exists for the Defendant.  The Court finds that the requirement to post  an undertaking is waived.  (Code Civ.  Proc. sec. 515.010.)   Plaintiff’s  application for writ of possession is GRANTED.     IT IS SO  ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE NOTICE.
