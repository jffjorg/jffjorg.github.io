English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the defendant's unopposed motion for terminating sanctions dismissing the plaintiff's complaint against the defendant. The plaintiff failed to comply with the court's orders to respond to discovery and pay sanctions. Despite multiple attempts to obtain the plaintiff's responses, the plaintiff failed to provide the requested information. The court finds that the plaintiff has been engaging in discovery abuse and has willfully misused the discovery process. The court concludes that terminating sanctions are warranted in this instance, as the plaintiff's failure to comply with the court's orders has caused detriment to the defendant's ability to prepare for trial.
