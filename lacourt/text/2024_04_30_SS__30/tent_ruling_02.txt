 Case Number:  21STCV46299    Hearing Date:   April 30, 2024    Dept:  30 HEIDI K. DIAZ vs JOSEPH JAMES MARTINTENTATIVEDefendant’s unopposed motion for terminating sanctions dismissing Plaintiff’s complaint against Defendant is GRANTED. Plaintiff’s complaint against Defendant is dismissed with prejudice. Moving party to give notice.Legal Standard"The trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse 'after considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the discovery.'" (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390 (quoting Lang v. Hachman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246).) "Generally, '[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.'" (Los Defensores, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390 (citation omitted).)"Under this standard, trial courts have properly imposed terminating sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed one or more discovery orders." (Id. (citing Lang, supra, 77 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1244- 1246); see, e.g., Collisson X Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622 (terminating sanctions imposed after defendants failed to comply with one court order to produce discovery); Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991) 231 Cal App 3d 481, 491 (disapproved on other grounds in Garcia v. McCucchen (1997) 16 Cal.4th 469, 478, n. 4) (terminating sanctions imposed against plaintiff for failing to comply with a discovery order and for violating various discovery statutes).)DiscussionDefendant moves for terminating sanctions against Plaintiff based on Plaintiff’s failure to comply with the Court’s February 6, 2024 and February 7, 2024 orders to respond to discovery and pay sanctions. After several failed attempts to obtain plaintiff’s responses to Defendant’s properly served discovery requests, Defendant filed motions to compel plaintiff’s responses which were granted on February 6, 2024 and February 7, 2024.On February 6, 2024, this Court granted Defendant’s motions to compel Plaintiff’s responses to Special Interrogatories (Set Two), Supplemental Interrogatories and Supplemental Request for Production. The court ordered Plaintiff Heidi K. Diaz to serve verified responses, without objections, to the discovery at issue within 20 days. (2/6/2024 Minute Order.) Further, on February 19, 2024, defense counsel served the Notice of Ruling on Plaintiff. (Chowdhury Decl., Exh. B; 2/20/2024 Notice of Ruling.)On February 7, 2024, the Court also granted Defendant’s motion to deem requests for admissions admitted and the Court imposed sanctions in the amount of $310 on Plaintiff, to be paid within 20 days. (2/7/2024 Minute Order.) To date, Plaintiff failed to provide responses or pay the Court-ordered sanctions. (Chowdhury Decl., ¶ 5.)First, Court notes that whether Plaintiff complied with the Court’s order to pay monetary sanctions is not relevant to the determination of whether terminating sanctions¿should be imposed. A court may not issue a terminating sanction for failure to pay a monetary discovery sanction. ¿(Newland v. Superior Court (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 610, 615.)¿ A monetary sanction order is enforceable as a money judgment under the Enforcement of Judgments Law, CCP §§680.010, et seq. (Id. at 615.)Nevertheless, the Court finds Plaintiff has been engaging in discovery abuse. Defendant propounded on Plaintiff discovery requests, yet Plaintiff failed to comply with her discovery obligations. Further, Plaintiff has also failed to provide responses to the discovery, even after this Court ordered her to do so. Moreover, the Court has already imposed monetary sanctions, and Plaintiff has still failed to comply. Therefore, less severe sanctions have not produced compliance with the discovery rules. Based on Plaintiff’s failure to comply with the Court’s Order, the Court finds that terminating sanctions are warranted in this instance. Additionally, Plaintiff has not filed an opposition, and thereby has failed to explain why she failed to comply with the Court’s order. As a result, the Court finds that Plaintiff has willfully misused the discovery process by this lack of diligence. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 787 [“Lack of diligence may be deemed willful in the sense that the party understood his obligation, had the ability to comply, and failed to comply.”]) Also, Plaintiff’s failure to comply is detrimental to Defendant’s ability to prepare for trial. As such, because there is a willful history of discovery abuse after numerous attempts to obtain such discovery, to the detriment of Defendant, the motion for terminating sanctions is granted.ConclusionBased on the foregoing, Defendant’s unopposed motion for terminating sanctions dismissing Plaintiff’s complaint against Defendant is GRANTED. Plaintiff’s complaint against Defendant is dismissed with prejudice.
