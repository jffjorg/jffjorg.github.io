And here is a summary of the judge's decision in English text:

The judge grants Plaintiff's motion to augment expert witness designation to add a toxicology expert to his expert witness list. The judge finds that the motion was timely under the circumstances, that Plaintiff demonstrated good cause for the late designation, and that granting the motion will not unduly prejudice Defendant or delay the trial. The judge notes that the issue of intoxication was not initially central to the case, as neither party designated a toxicology expert during the discovery phase. The judge also finds that Plaintiff acted with reasonable diligence in bringing this motion, as he has been attempting to address the need for a toxicology expert since learning of Defendant's intent to include an intoxication jury instruction. The judge cites several court cases in support of this decision, including Bonds v. Roy, Dickison v. Howen, Salas v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., and Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court.
