And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiffs to respond to their request for production of documents. The plaintiffs, Lonnie Lee Gipson and Betty Gipson, failed to timely respond to the defendant's written discovery, which was served on December 11, 2023. The court finds that the defendant properly served the written discovery and that the plaintiffs have waived their objections. As a result, the court orders the plaintiffs to serve a verified response without objections to the defendant's request for production of documents, set one, and to produce all documents and things in their possession, custody, or control that are responsive to the request, within 20 days. The court also orders the plaintiffs to pay a monetary sanction to the defendant in the amount of $490 within 30 days.
