And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a case between WVM Holdings, LLC (the plaintiff) and Victor Franco Noval, Secured Capital Partners, LLC, and Jake Noval (the defendants). The plaintiff is suing the defendants for adding judgement debtors and fraudulent transfer. The defendants are seeking summary judgment, arguing that the plaintiff cannot present admissible evidence showing that they are alter-egos or are otherwise subject to the original judgement, and that the plaintiff cannot show that it is a creditor of the defendants.

The judge has granted judicial notice of certain documents, overruled certain evidentiary objections, and denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment. The judge found that a triable issue of material fact exists as to whether the defendants are alter-egos of the original judgement debtors, and that a triable issue of material fact exists as to whether fraudulent transfer occurred. The judge also found that the parties have competing arguments about the origin of the funds used to purchase the Euclid property, and that both parties have offered admissible evidence.

The judge denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment, indicating that the case will proceed to trial.
