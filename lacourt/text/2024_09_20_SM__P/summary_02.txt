```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the defendants' motion to strike punitive damages from the complaint. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants, 9015 & 9025 Rangely LP, Oakwood Realty Corporation, and 1016 Sandborn LLC, were aware of previous security incidents and failed to take corrective measures, despite hiring a maintenance worker with a criminal history. The court finds that the allegations support a claim for punitive damages, as the defendants' actions could be interpreted as malice or an intent to injure. The court notes that similar cases have allowed punitive damages where landlords were aware of the probable dangerous consequences of their conduct and failed to take corrective measures.
