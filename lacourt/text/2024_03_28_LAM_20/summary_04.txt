This tentative ruling is about a lemon law action between Veloria James and Steven James (Plaintiffs) and American Honda Motor Co., Inc. (Defendant). The Defendant is seeking to compel an inspection of the Plaintiffs' vehicle, citing that the Plaintiffs have not provided a suitable date for the inspection. The Plaintiffs argue that they do not refuse the inspection, but rather, it should be done as part of the normal discovery process after the Defendant's PMK deposition, which has not been scheduled. The Judge grants the Motion to Compel, ordering the inspection to take place within 30 days on a date chosen by the Defendant. The Judge also encourages counsel to attend the hearing remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
