[1]              The demurrer and motion to strike
were filed (and electronically served) on October 25, 2023 and originally set
for hearing on December 7, 2023. On November 21, 2023, a “Notice Re:
Continuance of Hearing and Order” was filed, wherein the December 7, 2023
scheduled hearing was continued to February 26, 2024; notice was given to
counsel.


[2]              The court acknowledges that a
petition for review was granted in this matter by the California Supreme Court
on February 1, 2023 and that further action has been deferred “pending
consideration and disposition of a related issue in Rattagan v. Uber Techs.,
Inc. S272113. . . or pending further order of the court.” 
The California Supreme Court, however, denied a
request for an order directing depublication of the opinion; as such, Dhital
remains persuasive authority. (See Cal. Rules Ct. rule 8.1115, subds. (e)(1) [“Pending review
and filing of the Supreme Court's opinion, unless otherwise ordered by the
Supreme Court under (3), a published opinion of a Court of Appeal in the matter
has no binding or precedential effect, and may be cited for potentially
persuasive value only. . .”] and (e)(3) [“At any time after granting review or
after decision on review, the Supreme Court may order that all or part of an
opinion covered by (1) or (2) is not citable or has a binding or precedential
effect different from that specified in (1) or (2)”].)
