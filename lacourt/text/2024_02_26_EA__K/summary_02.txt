English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc.'s demurrer to Plaintiff Victor Paredes Ramirez's complaint and overrules it. The judge also denies Defendant's motion to strike portions of Plaintiff's complaint. The Plaintiff alleges that Defendant concealed the existence of a defect in the Honda Sensing system of a 2022 Honda CR-V, which caused the system to malfunction and create unsafe driving conditions. The Plaintiff alleges that Defendant knew or should have known about the defect before selling the vehicle and failed to disclose it to the Plaintiff. The judge finds that the Plaintiff has sufficiently pled the elements of fraudulent inducement—concealment and that Defendant's demurrer is overruled.
