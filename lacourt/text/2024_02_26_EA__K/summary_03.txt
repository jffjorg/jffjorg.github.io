And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a demurrer and motion to strike filed by [Defendant's Name] on October 25, 2023. The hearing was originally set for December 7, 2023, but was continued to February 26, 2024. The court acknowledges that a petition for review was granted by the California Supreme Court on February 1, 2023, and that further action has been deferred pending consideration and disposition of a related issue. The California Supreme Court denied a request for an order directing depublication of the opinion, and the opinion remains persuasive authority. The court will consider the persuasive value of the opinion in ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike.
