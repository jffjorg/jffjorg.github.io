And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants, West Coast Escrow Company, Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage Company, and First American Title Insurance Company. The plaintiff, Leon Thompson Jr., has brought claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud and deceit, negligent misrepresentation, and negligence against the defendants.

The judge sustains the demurrer filed by each defendant with 30 days leave to amend. This means that the plaintiff will need to re-file his complaint to address the defects identified by the judge.

The judge also denies the motion to strike as moot, since the demurrer has been sustained.

The judge allows leave to amend the complaint, but only as authorized by the court's order. The plaintiff may not amend the complaint to add a new party or cause of action without first obtaining permission from the court.

The judge's ruling is based on his review of the law and the pleadings filed by the parties. The judge has considered the elements of each cause of action and the allegations made by the plaintiff. The judge has also considered the defendants' arguments and has found them to be meritorious.
