Here is the summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the defendants' motion to compel the plaintiff to respond to discovery requests and to attend and testify at deposition, as well as their request for monetary sanctions. The defendants had served Form Interrogatories, Set One, on the plaintiff, but the plaintiff failed to respond. The defendants then moved to compel a response and requested monetary sanctions. The court denied the motion, citing the plaintiff's ability to bring a motion to waive objections and the defendants' failure to provide sufficient information in their declaration. The court also denied the defendants' motion to compel deposition testimony, as it was not accompanied by the required declaration. The court encourages the parties to engage in meaningful meet-and-confer efforts to resolve discovery disputes informally.
