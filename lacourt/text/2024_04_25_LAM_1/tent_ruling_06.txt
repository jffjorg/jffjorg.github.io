On March 18, 2024, Plaintiff

Motion to Relate Cases
 
Standard 
 
Pursuant to Los Angeles Superior Court Local Rule
3.3(f)(3), “[i]n the event that the judge designated under California Rules of
Court, rule 3.300(h)(1)(A)(B)(C) to make the decision, does not order related
any of the cases set forth in the Notice of Related Cases, any party may file a
motion to have the cases related. Department 1 shall hear the motion, if the
cases are all pending in the Central District or are pending in two or more
different districts.” (See also Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(h)(1)(D).)
 
The
Cases Shall Not Be Related a Second Time and Reassigned  
 
On April 3, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Related Case
involving 22STCV27559 and 22STCV39898. On June 30, 2023, Teresa Beaudet issued
an order finding the cases related and reassigned 22STCV39898 to Department 50.
 
On June 27, 2023, Judge Beaudet issued an order stating
“[a] Peremptory Challenge having been filed and accepted in related case
22STCV39898, this case and the related case 22STCV39898 are referred to
Department 1 for review and reassignment purposes only.”
 
On June 28, 2023, Department 1 issued an order stating
“[t]he court finds that interest of justice is not served by reassigning case
number 22STCV27559 to a new Judicial Officer. Therefore, this court determines
that cases 22STCV39898 and 22STCV27559 should no longer be related.” 
 
The
parties’ motion is captioned as a motion to relate and argues the two cases
satisfy California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a). However, the parties’ motion
more accurately seeks reconsideration of this Court’s June 28, 2023 order
unrelating the cases and finding the “interest of justice is not served by
reassigning case number 22STCV27559 to a new Judicial Officer.” There have been
no material changes in the two cases since June 28, 2023, other than the filing
of a cross-complaint for indemnity in 22STCV27559 against unnamed parties. The
Court finds no basis to deviate from its prior order, entered nearly ten months
ago. 
 
Pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(h)(1)(A),
“[w]here all the cases listed in the notice are unlimited civil cases, . . .
the judge who has the earliest filed case must determine whether the cases must
be ordered related and assigned to his or her department.” Here, 22STCV27559
pending before Judge Beaudet in Department 50, who initially related the two
cases. As the parties acknowledge, both cases cannot be assigned to Judge
Beaudet due to the acceptance of a peremptory challenge in the later filed
case. The judicial administration goals of the related case rules must yield to
the parties’ right to file a peremptory challenge. (See e.g. Rothstein v. Superior Court (2016) 3
Cal.App.5th 424, 431.) Moreover, the peremptory challenge statutes should not
be used as a mechanism to effectively extend the time requirements for a
peremptory challenge in the earlier filed case. (Ibid. n.3. See also The
Home Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2005) 34 Cal.4th 1025, 1032 (“section
170.6 is designed to prevent abuse by parties that merely seek to . . . obtain
a more favorable judicial forum.”).)
 
While
the parties contend there may be a duplication of effort in the parallel
proceedings, both the litigants and the assigned judicial officers are capable
of managing such issues. (Rothstein, supra, 3 Cal.App.5th at 432.) 
 
The motion is DENIED. The cases shall remain as assigned by
this Court on June 28, 2023.
