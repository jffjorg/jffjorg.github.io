And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to relate the two cases, 22TRCV00428 and 22STCV17187, which are cases arising from the same helicopter accident that resulted in fatalities. The court finds that the cases are related because they arise from the same or substantially identical transactions, incidents, or events requiring the determination of the same or substantially identical questions of law or fact. The court also finds that the cases are likely to require a substantial duplication of judicial resources if they continue to be heard by different judges. The court grants the defendant's motion to relate the cases and orders that the case be reassigned to Department 55 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
