And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court declines to relate the cases identified by the defendant, as they do not meet the requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a). The cases involve different parties, causes of action, and factual and legal issues. While the cases share some commonalities, such as the same defendants and counsel, they do not arise from the same or substantially identical transactions, incidents, or events. The court concludes that the cases are not related within the meaning of the rule and denies the motion to relate the cases.
