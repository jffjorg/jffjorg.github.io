ALBERT GREGORY PINTO vs MAHA VISCONTI
Defendant Maha Visconti’s Motion to Transfer
TENTATIE RULING: 
If Plaintiff Pinto appears, the motion is DENIED.  If Plaintiff Pinto does not appear, the
motion is taken OFF-CALENDAR for lack of notice.
Motion to Transfer Between Districts
 
The
Local Rules of the Los Angeles Superior Court govern the assignment of cases
between its districts and departments. (Code Civ. Proc. § 402.) LASC Local Rule
2.3(b)(2) authorizes Department 1 to transfer civil cases from one judicial
district to another via a noticed motion on three enumerated grounds: (1) when
the case was filed in an improper district; (2) for the convenience of
witnesses; or (3) to promote the ends of justice.
(LASC Local Rule 2.3(b)(2).) A transfer under the Local Rules is discretionary.

 
If Plaintiff Pinto Does Not Appear,
the Motion is Taken OFF-CALENDAR 
 
On November 20, 2023, Visconti filed a Notice of
Motion and Motion to Transfer listing the hearing date as June 25, 2024 in
Department 1. On January 11, 2024, Pinto filed an opposition to the motion with
the caption listing the then-correct hearing date of January 25, 2024.
 
Prior to the hearing on the motion, Visconti changed
the motion reservation in the Court Reservation System, placing the motion to
transfer on Department 1’s calendar for Thursday, February 22, 2024.
Thereafter, Visconti again changed the motion reservation in the Court
Reservation System, placing the motion to transfer on Department 1’s calendar
for Thursday, April 25, 2024.
 
Visconti did not file a new notice of motion for the
continued hearing date and it is unclear whether the Pinto is
aware of the new hearing date. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1010 (“the notice of a motion
. . . must state when . . . it will be made.”).) Proper service and notice are
required to satisfy due process. (See generally McMillin v. Eare (2021)
70 Cal.App.5th 893, 913 (describing the “right to notice, which is an element
of due process.”).) Absent evidence of proper notice and service, the Court
lacks jurisdiction to act. (See e.g. Lee v. Placer Title Co. (1994) 28
Cal.App.4th 503, 509; Code Civ. Proc. § 1005.) “[P]ro per litigants are not
entitled to special exemptions from the California Rules of Court or Code of
Civil Procedure.” (Gamet v. Blanchard (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1276, 1284.)
 
If Plaintiff Pinto does not appear at
the hearing, the motion will be taken OFF-CALENDAR due to lack of proper
notice. 
 
If Plaintiff Pinto appears at the
hearing, he will be deemed to have waived this defect. (See e.g. Tate v.
Superior Court (1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 925, 930 (“It is well settled that the
appearance of a party at the hearing of a motion and his or her opposition to
the motion on its merits is a waiver of any defects or irregularities in the
notice of the motion.”).)
 
If Plaintiff Pinto Appears, the Motion
is DENIED on the Merits
 
While the caption of the July 13, 2023 motion
references a separately filed declaration of George E. Murphy, no such
declaration was filed, either on November 20, 2023 or July 13, 2023. Visconti’s
motion is not supported by any evidence. 
 
In the motion, Visconti
makes numerous requests and allegations, many of which are immaterial to the
types of relief Department 1 has the authority to provide. The motion appears
to request that the case be transferred to the Ventura County Superior Court.
(Mot. at 2:10-11, 6:20-22, 9:11-10:13.) The Local Rules of the
Los Angeles Superior Court generally dictate the types of motions heard in
Department 1. Department 1 does not hear motions to transfer cases out of Los
Angeles County. Accordingly, Visconti’s request to transfer the action to
Ventura County is DENIED without prejudice.
 
Similarly, Department 1
is not the proper department to rule on Visconti’s jurisdictional arguments.
Nothing in the Local Rules authorizes Department 1 to make jurisdictional
determinations. 
 
Visconti continues to
assert Judge Mandel has a conflict of interest or should not preside over the
case. (Mot. at 7:3-9:10.) However, the Code of Civil Procedure dictates the
proper procedural mechanisms to request disqualification of a judicial officer
and seek review of any denial thereof. (Code Civ. Proc. § 170 et seq.) A motion
to transfer is not a valid substitute for this procedure.
 
In the motion, Visconti
also contends the Santa Monica Courthouse is not convenient for her and her
counsel. Visconti is now self-represented, having filed a substitution of
attorney on October 23, 2023. Moreover, “[c]onvenience of counsel is not a permissible
basis for a change of venue motion.” (Lieppman v. Lieber (1986) 180
Cal.App.3d 914, 920.) Accordingly, the convenience of her former counsel cannot
support a motion to transfer. Similarly, Visconti’s convenience is also not
considered for purposes of a motion to transfer. (Peiser v. Mettler (1958) 50 Cal.2d
594, 612 (“convenience of the parties is not to be considered upon a motion for
a change of venue”); Stute v. Burinda (1981) 123
Cal.App.3d Supp. 11, 17.) 
 
Visconti further contends
it is “not clear how this case was shifted around from its main Judge Honorable
Whitaker at 312 Spring Street, Los Angeles all the way to Santa Monica since
both parties involved in this litigation do NOT reside in Santa Monica,” (Mot.
at 3:12-14), and requests the case be sent back to Judge Michael E. Whitaker.
(Mot. at 9:20-23.) Judge Whitaker determined this case to be a complicated
personal injury action on August 17, 2022 and the case was transferred pursuant
to the court’s then-existing procedures related to complicated personal injury
cases. Visconti cites no authority supporting the transfer back to Judge
Whitaker. 
 
Visconti, as the moving
party, failed to demonstrate any factual or legal basis for Department 1 to
transfer the action. Accordingly, the motion is DENIED.
