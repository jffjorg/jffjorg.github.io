Defendant’s Motion re: Deeming Cases “Related” and
Transferring Action to Central District
TENTATIVE RULING: 
Defendant Robinson Helicopter Company, Inc.’s Motion Re: Deeming Cases
“Related” And Transferring Action To Central District is GRANTED as to the
request to relate the two cases. The request to transfer is MOOT.  Accordingly, Department 1 relates civil law
cases 22TRCV00428 and  22STCV17187 orders
22TRCV00428 reassigned to Department 55 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse for all

advanced and vacated.  Counsel for
Defendant to give notice.
Background
of 22TRCV00428 Trout v. Robinson Helicopter 
 
On May 25, 2022, Basia Trout,
individually and as the personal representative of Decedent Lora Trout, and
Roger Trout, filed 22TRCV00428 against Robinson Helicopter Company arising out
of a March 25, 2022 helicopter accident near Rowlett, Texas in which “[t]he
certified flight instructor (CFI Lora Trout) and student pilot (Ty Wallis)
sustained fatal injuries.” (Compl. ¶ 29.) The complaint asserts causes of action for: (1) strict products
liability; and (2) negligence. Plaintiff identifies fourteen different defects
in the N514CD helicopter manufactured by Defendant involved in the accident,
which along with Defendant’s flight training syllabus, are alleged to be
substantial factors in the accident. 
 
On July 15, 2022, Robinson
Helicopter filed a cross-complaint against Basia Trout, as the personal
representative of Lora Trout, for: (1) equitable indemnity; (2) comparative
indemnity; (3) equitable apportionment of fault; (4) contribution; and (5)
declaratory relief. The cross-complaint attaches the complaint filed in
22STCV17187 Wallis v. Robinson Helicopter, and seeks to determine the
parties’ relative liability for any damages in that case. 
 
On July 19, 2022, Defendant filed
Notice of Related Case involving 22TRCV00428 and 22STCV17187. On September 13,
2022, Judge Malcolm Mackey issued an order finding the cases were “not related
within the meaning of California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a).”
 
This case is currently pending in
Department B of the Torrance Courthouse with the next hearing set for June 20,
2024.
 
Background
of 22STCV17187 Wallis v. Robinson Helicopter
 
On May 24, 2022, Kristen M.
Wallis, as Personal Representative of the Estate of Tyson Wallis, filed 22STCV17187
against Robinson Helicopter Company, Inc. arising out of the March 25, 2022 helicopter
accident in Rowlett, Texas that resulted in the death of Dr.
Tyson ‘Ty’ Wallis, a student pilot on an instructional flight, and flight
instructor Lora Trout. The complaint
asserts causes of action for: (1) strict product liability; and (2) negligence.
The complaint alleges the “N514CD was defective in its manufacture
and/or design and/or lack of warnings, and was otherwise unreasonably
dangerous, including but not limited to, by leading to separation of the tail
rotor section, tail boom strikes, mast-bumping, loss of control, and sudden
catastrophic break up during normal flight.” (Compl. ¶ 37.) 
 
On July 19, 2022, Robinson
Helicopter filed a cross-complaint against Kristen Wallis, as the personal
representative of the Estate of Tyson Wallace, for: (1) equitable indemnity;
(2) comparative indemnity; (3) equitable apportionment of fault; (4)
contribution; and (5) declaratory relief. The cross-complaint attaches the
complaint filed in 22TRCV00428 and seeks to determine the parties’ relative
liability for any damages in that case. 
 
Also on July 19, 2022, Defendant
filed a Motion to Transfer from the Central District of Los Angeles County Superior
Court to the Southwest District. Judge David J. Cowan, then sitting in
Department 1, denied the motion on December 8, 2022. Though the order addressed
the standard for relating cases and discussed the issue, the order provided
“[t]he
Court notes they are not ruling on the relatedness issue and only ruling on the
issue of transfer.” 
 
This case is currently pending in
Department 55 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse with trial set for February 24,
2025. 
 
Judicial
Notice
 
Defendant’s request for judicial
notice of various documents filed in the two cases is GRANTED as to their
existence and legal effect only. (Evid. Code § 452(d).) The request for
judicial notice of the National Transportation Safety Board’s Preliminary
Report is also GRANTED. (Evid. Code § 452(c).)  
 
Motion to Relate Cases
 
Standard 
 
In the event that the pertinent judge under California
Rules of Court, rule 3.300(h)(1) does not relate any of the cases set forth in
a Notice of Related Case, Department 1 may relate the matters on noticed
motion. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(h)(1)(D); LASC Local Rules, rule 3.3(f)(3).) 
 
The Motion to Relate is Procedurally
Proper
 
As noted above, Judge Mackey issued an order declining to
relate the two cases on September 13, 2022. In their objection and response,
Plaintiffs cite Code of Civil section 1008, which is immaterial to Defendant’s
motion herein. Defendant’s motion is
expressly authorized by California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(h)(1)(D) and LASC
Local Rules, rule 3.3(f)(3) and is not constrained by
the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1008. Defendant’s argument
that a Notice of Related Case is not an “application for an order” within the
meaning of Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, (Reply at 2:26-28), is also
persuasive. 
 
Defendant’s motion is also not an improper motion for
reconsideration of Defendant’s prior motion in Department 1. Judge Cowan’s
prior order noted Defendant had not moved to relate the cases and expressly
declined to rule on the relatedness issue.
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s motion to relate is properly
made in Department 1. 
 
Court Finds the Cases are Related 
 
Cases
are related when they (1) involve the same parties and are based on the same or
similar claims, (2) arise from the same or substantially identical
transactions, incidents, or events requiring the determination of the same or
substantially identical questions of law or fact, (3) involve claims against,
title to, possession of, or damages to the same property, or (4) are likely for
other reasons to require substantial duplication of judicial resources if heard
by different judges. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(a).) Issues raised by Plaintiff
Wallace regarding potential jury confusion, (Opp. at 6:13-14), are more
appropriate in response to a motion for consolidation and are immaterial to a
motion to relate. 
 
The
cases do not involve the same parties and are based on the same or similar
claims. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(a)(1).) As Defendant acknowledges, “the
plaintiffs are different.” (Mot. at 12:6.) 
 
However,
the cases do arise from the same or substantially identical transactions,
incidents, or events requiring the determination of the same or substantially
identical questions of law or fact. Both cases arise from the March 25, 2022 N514CD helicopter accident near Rowlett, Texas in
which Lora Trout and Tyrone Wallis were killed as well as the manufacture and
design of the N514CD. Both cases allege the N514CD was defective,
subjecting Robinson Helicopter to strict products liability and Robinson
Helicopter was negligent in its manufacture and design of the N514CD. Identical
questions of law and fact regarding the N514CD predominate both cases. 
 
The
cases are also likely to require a substantial duplication of judicial
resources if they continue to be heard by different judges. (Cal. R. Ct., rule
3.300(a)(4).) The cases arise from the same accident and assert the same claims
against the same defendant. Other than issues pertaining to damages and
relative fault, the cases are likely to be substantially identical in the legal
issues presented and the judicial resources required to bring the matters to a
resolution. Additionally, in both cases, Robinson Helicopter filed a
cross-complaint relying upon the other case and seeking to apportion liability.
Thus, the judicial officer in each case will be required to review the other
action to resolve the cross-complaint. 
 
The
Court finds 22TRCV00428 and 22STCV17187 related within the meaning of
California Rules of Court, rule 3.300.
 
Defendant’s
motion to deem the cases related is GRANTED. 
 
Motion to Transfer Between Districts
 
Defendant separately moved the Court to transfer the action
to Department 55 of the Central District pursuant to Los Angeles Superior Court
Local Rule 2.3(b)(2). (Mot. at 15:23-17:21.) This request is MOOT in light of
the Court’s ruling on the request to relate the two cases.
 
The Court notes Defendant’s request failed to satisfy Local
Rule 2.3(b)(2) as it argues the ends of justice would be promoted only by a
transfer specifically to Department 55 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse in the
Central District. (Mot. at 8:11-14; 17:25-18:2; Reply at 3: 3-4; 9:20-25.)
However, Local Rule 2.3 authorizes a transfer to the Central District generally.
(LASC Local Rule, 2.3(b)(2) (“The Supervising Judge of the Civil Division may .
. . transfer a civil case from one district to another.”). Nothing in the Local
Rules permits the Court to transfer a case to a specific department within a
district and litigants are not permitted to choose their assigned judicial
officer. (See generally LASC Local 3.3(b) (“The clerk must take all reasonably
appropriate steps, including a system of random use of case numbers, to ensure
that neither any party nor any counsel will be able to anticipate a case
assignment.”).) Defendant’s motion does not argue or demonstrate that the ends
of justice would be served by a transfer to the Central District, rather than to
a specific judicial officer, as required.
