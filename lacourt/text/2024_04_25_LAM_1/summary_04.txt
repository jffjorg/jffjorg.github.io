Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to relate and consolidate two cases. The plaintiff, Beverly Cherico, filed the motion on March 5, 2024, which was premature since the plaintiff did not provide the court with a reasonable opportunity to rule on the Notice of Related Case before filing the motion. The court had previously declined to relate the cases on March 19, 2024, and the plaintiff's motion does not provide any basis for the court to reconsider its prior order. The court finds that the plaintiff's motion is DENIED in its entirety. Additionally, the court finds that the request to consolidate the actions is premature and not properly brought in Department 1.
