And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint is sustained without leave to amend. The demurrer was filed based on the plaintiff's failure to comply with the Government Claims Act, which requires that claims for money or damages against a public entity be presented in accordance with specific provisions of the Government Code. The judge has also denied the plaintiff's request for leave to amend the complaint, as the plaintiff has not demonstrated a reasonable possibility of curing the defects in the complaint through amendment. Additionally, the judge has ruled that the defendant's motion to strike references to punitive and exemplary damages in the complaint's prayer for damages is moot, as the demurrer is well-taken and sustained without leave to amend.
