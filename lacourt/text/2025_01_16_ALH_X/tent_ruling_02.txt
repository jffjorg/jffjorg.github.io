Legal Authority and AnalysisDefendant’s Demurrer“The function of a demurrer is to test the sufficiency of the complaint as a matter of law.”  (Holiday Matinee, Inc. v. Rambus, Inc. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 1413, 1420.)  A complaint “is sufficient if it alleges ultimate rather than evidentiary facts” (Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550 (“Doe”)), but the plaintiff must set forth the essential facts of his or her case “with reasonable precision and with particularity sufficient to acquaint [the] defendant with the nature, source and extent” of the plaintiff’s claim.  (Doheny Park Terrace Homeowners Assn., Inc. v. Truck Ins. Exchange (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 1076, 1099.) Legal conclusions are insufficient.  (Id., at pp. 1098–99.)  The Court “assume[s] the truth of the allegations in the complaint, but do[es] not assume the truth of contentions, deductions, or conclusions of law.”  (California Logistics, Inc. v. State of California (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 242, 247.)  A demurrer lies only for defects appearing on the face of the complaint or from matters of which the court must or may take judicial notice.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.40; see Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and is uncertain.  Defendant further contends that Plaintiff has not complied with the California Government Claims Act, which is a jurisdictional prerequisite to maintaining a lawsuit against a public entity.Regarding the latter, all claims for money or damages against a public entity must be presented in accordance with the provisions of the Government Code, unless it is subject to a specific exception.  (Gov. Code, § 905.)  These requirements are part of the “Government Claims Act” (the “Act”).  (See Gov. Code § 810, et seq.)  “The (Act) sets forth the general rule of immunity for public entities, abolishing all common law or judicially declared forms of liability for public entities, except for such liability as may be required by the state or federal constitution, or if a statute ... is found declaring them to be liable.”  (West Contra Costa Unified School District v. Superior Court of Contra Costa County (2024) 103 Cal.App.5th 1243, 1254, internal quotations omitted.)The Government Code requires that “[a] claim relating to a cause of action for death or for injury to person or to personal property…shall be presented as provided in Article 2 (commencing with Section 915) not later than six months after the accrual of the cause of action.”  (Gov. Code, § 911.2(a).)  Claimants who fail to file a claim within the six-month period have one year from the accrual of the cause of action to request leave to submit an untimely claim.  (Id., at § 911.4.)  “[T]he claims presentation requirement applies to all forms of monetary demands, regardless of the theory of the action.”  (Sparks v. Kern County Board of Supervisors (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 794, 798.)  “The claim presentation requirement serves several purposes: (1) it gives the public entity prompt notice of a claim so it can investigate the strengths and weaknesses of the claim while the evidence is still fresh and the witnesses are available; (2) it affords opportunity for amicable adjustment, thereby avoiding expenditure of public funds in needless litigation; and (3) it informs the public entity of potential liability so it can better prepare for the upcoming fiscal year.”  (Munoz v. State of California (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1767, 1776-1779; see also Sparks, supra, 173 Cal.App.4th at 798.)Plaintiff has not alleged facts showing that she complied with the Government Claims Act by presenting a claim.  Thus, the demurrer to the entirety of the complaint is sustained on this basis.On the issue of leave to amend, the demurrer is not opposed.  Plaintiff has not demonstrated a reasonable possibility of curing the defects in the complaint through amendment.  In the absence of such a demonstration, leave to amend is denied.Defendant’s Motion to StrikeDefendant moves to strike references to punitive and exemplary damages in the complaint’s prayer for damages.  As the demurrer is well-taken, unopposed, and sustained without leave to amend, the motion to strike is moot.Moving Party is to provide notice.
