And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a lemon law action brought by Rodolfo G. Meza against Kia America, Inc. The case involves the purchase of a 2020 Kia Forte, which was found to be defective. Meza's counsel, Consumer Law Experts, PC, seeks attorney's fees in the amount of $68,941.50 for their work on the case. The judge grants the motion for attorney's fees, finding that the fees are reasonable.

The judge also denies Kia America's motion to tax certain costs, including filing and motion fees, deposition costs, service of process costs, expert witness fees, and court reporter fees. The judge finds that these costs are standard and necessary for litigating a lemon law action, and are therefore recoverable under the Song-Beverly Act.

The judge's ruling is subject to change based on any objections or submissions made by the parties before the hearing date of September 12, 2024.
