And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrers to the First Amended Cross-Complaint and the motion for leave to amend. The judge has sustained demurrers to various causes of action brought by Cross-Complainant Erde against Cross-Defendants Cartwright, Balboa, LLC, and Dolores Golden.

The judge has sustained demurrers to the third, fifth, and seventh causes of action brought by Erde against Cartwright, alleging breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and common counts. The judge has also sustained demurrers to the fourth, sixth, and seventh causes of action brought by Erde against Balboa, alleging common counts.

The judge has denied Erde's motion for leave to amend the cross-complaint, as the demurrers have been sustained. The judge has given Erde 30 days to file and serve a second amended cross-complaint, and 30 days for Cross-Defendants to file and serve responses.

The judge has also indicated that Erde has failed to allege sufficient facts to state causes of action for common counts against Cartwright and Balboa, and that the seventh cause of action brought by Erde against Balboa is not cognizable.
