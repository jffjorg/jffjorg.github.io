And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of TAMARA LEVINE vs JEFFREY ALBRIGHT and the CITY OF AGOURA. The defendant CITY OF AGOURA filed discovery motions against the plaintiff, alleging that the plaintiff did not comply with discovery requests. The judge finds that the plaintiff had substantially complied with discovery, but the delay in responding was caused by the defendant's filing of the motions. The judge concludes that this is discovery abuse, as the plaintiff was given multiple extensions of time and email reminders, but still failed to respond promptly. The judge denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions against the defendant, as the plaintiff was solely at fault in the discovery dispute.
