 Case Number:  23VECV00840    Hearing Date:   December 11, 2023    Dept:  T 23VECV00840
TAMARA LEVINE vs JEFFREY ALBRIGHT
Tentative
ruling:  Discovery motions against
plaintiff by defendant City of Agoura. 
Plaintiff has substantially complied with the discovery and therefore,
any determination that the responses are insufficient would require a meet and
confer and separate motion to compel further responses.  However, the court finds that it was only
because the motions were filed that resulted in the late responses.  Accordingly, there was no substantial
justification for the failure to respond to the discovery before the motions
were filed, despite requests for multiple extensions of time which were granted
and email reminder that the responses were overdue, which required the motion
for compliance.  This is discovery abuse.
CCP section 2023.010. The court notes also that the discovery was due June 2023
but was not served until November 2023.   Although the court issued an order on the
discovery motions by co-defendant Albright on 10/6/2023, it was still an
additional month before the discovery responses were served to the City of
Agoura. Finally, in a surprising display of nerve making the request at all,
plaintiff’s request for sanctions against the moving party is DENIED given
plaintiff was solely at fault in this discovery dispute.
