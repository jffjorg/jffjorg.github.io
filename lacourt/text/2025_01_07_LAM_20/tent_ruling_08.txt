This is an action in which Plaintiff Emily Rodriguez, a website “tester”, alleges that Defendant Refuel Agency, Inc. violated the California Invasion of Privacy Act by allowing its website to install a pen register and/or trap and trace device on Plaintiff’s browsers so as to collect data about Plaintiff.  Defendant Refuel Agency, Inc. seeks to quash service of summons due to lack of personal jurisdiction.A defendant may move to quash service of summons on the ground the Court lacks personal jurisdiction.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 418.10(a)(1).)  “Although the defendant is the moving party, the plaintiff must carry the initial burden of demonstrating facts by a preponderance of evidence justifying the exercise of jurisdiction in California.”  (In re Automobile Antitrust Cases I and II (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 100, 110.)By statute, the courts of this state may exercise personal jurisdiction over nonresident defendants to the extent permitted by the United States Constitution.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 410.10.)  Constitutional due process requires that a nonresident defendant have “certain minimum contacts” with a forum such that the Court’s exercise of personal jurisdiction does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.  (International Shoe Co. v. State of Washington (1945) 326 U.S. 310, 316.)  The extent of the defendant’s contacts with the forum determines whether the Court’s jurisdiction is general or specific.  (Daimler AG v. Bauman (2014) 134 S.Ct. 746, 754-755.)  Courts may assert general jurisdiction where the foreign defendant’s contacts with the forum “ ‘are so “continuous and systematic” as to render them essentially at home in the forum State.’ ”  (Id. at p. 754.)  To determine whether the exercise of specific jurisdiction is proper in a given case, courts consider the relationship among the defendant, the forum, and the litigation.  (Pavlovich v. Superior Court (2002) 29 Cal.4th 262, 269.)  “A court may exercise specific jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant only if: (1) the defendant has purposefully availed himself or herself of forum benefits; (2) the controversy is related to or arises out of the defendant’s contacts with the forum; and (3) the assertion of personal jurisdiction would comport with fair play and substantial justice.”  (Elkman v. National States Ins. Co. (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 1305, 1314.)  It is the plaintiff’s burden to demonstrate that the defendant’s conduct giving rise to the pleaded causes of action amounts to constitutionally cognizable “minimum contacts.”  (Id. at p. 1313.)Plaintiff does not attempt to support general jurisdiction.  Instead, she argues that there is specific jurisdiction based on the commercial purpose of Defendant’s website and its level of interactivity: “The Website contains multiple interactive features, and is commercial in nature. (Ferrell Decl. ¶¶ 2-3 & Exs. 2-3.) . . . Visitors to the Website who are interested in the services advertised on the Website are invited to fill out interactive fillable form with the user’s contact information including the user’s email address and phone number. (Ferrell Decl. ¶ 2 & Ex. 2.) Indeed, Defendant freely admits that its Website contains a fillable form. (Cassino Decl. ¶ 10.)” “To determine whether a Web site is sufficient to establish purposeful availment, we first look to [a] sliding scale analysis .... [Citation.] ‘At one  end of the spectrum are situations where a defendant clearly does business over the Internet. If the defendant enters into contracts with residents of a foreign jurisdiction that involve the knowing and repeated transmission of computer files over the Internet, personal jurisdiction is proper. [Citation.] At the opposite end are situations where a defendant has simply posted information on an Internet Web site which is accessible to users in foreign jurisdictions. A passive Web site that does little more than make information available to those who are interested in it is not grounds for the exercise [of] personal jurisdiction. [Citation.] The middle ground is occupied by interactive Web sites where a user can exchange information with the host computer. In these cases, the exercise of jurisdiction is determined by examining the level of interactivity and commercial nature of the exchange of information that occurs on the Web site.’ [Citation.]” (Snowney v. Harrah's Entertainment, Inc., (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1054, 1063.)“ ‘Some courts have held that sufficient minimum contacts are established, and the defendant is “doing business” over the Internet, where the defendant's website is capable of accepting and does accept purchase orders from residents of the forum state.’ [Citation.] Other courts have suggested that ‘ “something more” ’ is necessary, such as ‘ “deliberate action” within the forum state in the form of transactions between the defendant and residents of the forum or conduct of the defendant purposefully directed at residents of the forum state.’ [Citations.] Other courts ‘have criticized ... emphasis on website interactivity’ [citation] and focus instead on ‘traditional due process principles’ [citation], asking whether the site expressly targets ‘residents of the forum state’ [citation]. According to these courts, ‘Website interactivity is important only insofar as it reflects commercial activity, and then only insofar as that commercial activity demonstrates purposeful targeting of residents of the forum state or purposeful availment of the benefits or privileges of the forum state.’ [Citations.]” (Snowney v. Harrah's Entertainment, Inc., supra, 35 Cal.4th at p. 1064.)“[U]nder California case law, making a substantial number of sales of goods or services to California residents via one's own website constitutes purposeful availment. The vast majority of federal cases are in accord. (E.g., Rovio Entertainment, Ltd. v. Allstar Vending, Inc. (S.D.N.Y. 2015) 97 F.Supp.3d 536, 542; Advanced Skin & Hair, Inc. v. Bancroft (C.D. Cal. 2012) 858 F.Supp.2d 1084, 1090; Rainy Day Books, Inc. v. Rainy Day Books & Cafe, L.L.C. (D. Kan. 2002) 186 F.Supp.2d 1158, 1163-1165; American Eyewear, Inc. v. Peeper's Sunglasses and Accessories, Inc. (N.D. Tex. 2000) 106 F.Supp.2d 895, 900-901; Zippo Mfg. Co. v. Zippo Dot Com, Inc. (W.D. Pa. 1997) 952 F.Supp. 1119, 1125-1127; see also Gorman v. Ameritrade Holding Corp. (D.C. Cir. 2002) 293 F.3d 506, 512–513 [‘continuous and systematic’ website sales to state residents supports general jurisdiction]; contra, Fidrych v. Marriott International, Inc. (4th Cir. 2020) 952 F.3d 124, 141-143.)  [] Admittedly, the sales must be substantial; they are not enough if they are only ‘random, isolated, or fortuitous ....’ (See Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc. (1984) 465 U.S. 770, 774, 104 S.Ct. 1473, 79 L.Ed.2d 790.)”  (Thurston v. Fairfield Collectibles of Georgia, LLC (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 1231, 1240.)The subject website advertises marketing services for higher education institutions.  It is interactive in the sense that one can click “Contact” and then provide one’s contact information and a message, such that Defendant could follow-up at a later time.  The website also allows users to enter search terms for blog posts, but this has a minimal commercial characteristic.   The website indicates that marketing services have been provided to over 400 colleges, but with respect to California, it specifically mentions only CSU and Azusa Pacific University.  (RJN: www.thinkingcapagency.com/about/.)  There is no statement on the website that specifically targets California residents.  Plaintiff points to a statement that Defendant has some sort of presence in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara; that statement does not come from the challenged website, www.thinkingcapagency.com, but rather www.refuelagency.com/contact-us/.  The nature of this presence is unexplained by Plaintiff.  Defendant, on the other hand, indicates that its only corporate office is in New Jersey and that all other offices were closed after COVID.  Defendant has approximately ten employees in California.     As mentioned, there is some conflict in the law as to what level of interactivity constitutes purposeful availment.  (Snowney v. Harrah's Entertainment, Inc., supra, 35 Cal.4th at p. 1064; see also Weil et al., Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial (The Rutter Guide 2021) Ch. 3-B.)  The Court agrees with the line of cases finding that something more is required than the website’s ability to accept purchase orders from the forum state; that is, the defendant must have specifically targeted persons in the forum state, through substantial sales or otherwise.  Plaintiff has not shown evidence of this.  It is only apparent that Defendant provided some service to two California universities for an unknown time.  Further, the examples of interactivity provided by Plaintiff are alone insufficient as there is no evidence “a substantial number of hits to defendant's websites came from California, nor have they shown that defendant's websites displayed advertisements targeted to California residents, nor have they provided any other evidence that defendant ‘anticipated, desired, and achieved a substantial California viewer base.’ ”  (DFSB Kollective Co. v. Bourne (N.D. Cal. 2012) 897 F.Supp.2d 871, 874.)  The Court concludes that Plaintiff failed to establish that Defendant purposely availed itself of this forum’s benefits via the subject website.  Further, Defendant’s only proven links to this forum—the provision of services to two clients and the maintenance of ten employees—do not relate to this lawsuit.  Plaintiff requests jurisdictional discovery.  “The plaintiff has the right to conduct discovery with regard to the issue of jurisdiction to develop the facts necessary to sustain this burden.”  (Mihlon v. Superior Ct. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 703, 710.)  However, “a continuance [of a motion to quash] may be denied if there is no showing that discovery would likely produce evidence of additional ‘contacts.’ ” [Beckman v. Thompson (1992) 4 CA4th 481, 486-487, 6 CR2d 60, 63].”  (Weil et al., Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial (The Rutter Guide 2021) Ch. 3-B.)The Court, in the exercise of its discretion, will not allow jurisdictional discovery under the circumstances here.  The Motion to Quash is granted.Moving party to give notice.
