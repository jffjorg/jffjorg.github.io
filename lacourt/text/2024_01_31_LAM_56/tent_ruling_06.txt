MOVING
PARTY: Defendant Bank of America, N.A. (“Moving Defendant”) 
 
The
Court has considered the moving papers.  No
opposition papers were filed.  Any
opposition papers were required to have been filed and served at least nine
court days before the hearing under California Code of Civil Procedure section
1005, subdivision (b).
 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiffs’
complaint (the “Complaint”) alleges: (1) breach of implied contract of
confidentiality; and (2) violation of California Financial Information Privacy
Act.
 
On
January 5, 2024, Moving Defendant filed a demurrer (the “Demurrer”) on the
grounds that the Complaint fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a
cause of action.
 
 
As it is unopposed, the Court SUSTAINS
the Demurrer with 20 days leave to amend. 
(Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
