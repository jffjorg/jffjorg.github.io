And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the demurrer filed by the defendant, Daniel Bedoya, arguing that the complaint filed by the plaintiff, SSR Miracle Mile, LLC, fails to state a cause of action. The court has reviewed the complaint and has found that it alleges unlawful detainer and that the defendant has not provided sufficient evidence to support his argument that the complaint fails to state a cause of action. The court has also found that the complaint alleges the existence of a lease agreement, which is a factual dispute that is beyond the scope of the court's review of the demurrer. Therefore, the court has overruled the demurrer and ordered the defendant to file and serve a responsive pleading within 20 days of the date of this order.
