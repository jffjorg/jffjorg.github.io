And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion filed by the plaintiff to file an amended complaint, which alleges violations of the Tenant Anti-Harassment Ordinance. The plaintiff filed the motion on January 12, 2024, but it does not comply with the service requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure section 1005. Additionally, no proof of service was filed, so it is unclear if the defendant received notice of the motion. The court is continuing the motion to March 19, 2024 to allow the plaintiff to serve the defendant with the motion and to give the defendant the opportunity to respond.
