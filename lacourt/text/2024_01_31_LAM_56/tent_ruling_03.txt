MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff
 
The
Court has considered the moving papers.  No
opposition papers were filed.  Any
opposition papers were required to have been filed and served at least nine
court days before the hearing under California Code of Civil Procedure section
1005, subdivision (b).
 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff’s complaint (the “Complaint”)
alleges violations of the Tenant Anti-Harassment Ordinance.[1]
 
 
            On January 12, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a motion to file an amended complaint (the “Motion”).  
 
DISCUSSION
California Code
of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section 473 permits the trial court
in its discretion to allow amendments to pleadings in the furtherance of
justice.  (CCP § 473, subd. (a)(1).)  CCP section 576 provides that any judge, at
any time before or after commencement of trial, in the furtherance of justice,
and upon such terms as may be proper, may allow the amendment of any pleading
or pretrial conference order.  (CCP §
576.)  There is a policy of great
liberality in permitting amendments to the pleadings at any stage of the
proceeding.  (Berman v. Bromberg (1997)
56 Cal.App.4th 936, 945.)  An application
to amend a pleading is addressed to the trial judge’s sound discretion.  (Id.)  If the motion to amend is timely made and the
granting of the motion will not prejudice the opposing party, it is error to
refuse permission to amend and where the refusal also results in a party being
deprived of the right to assert a meritorious cause of action or a meritorious
defense, it is not only error but an abuse of discretion.  (Morgan v. Superior Court of Cal. In and
For Los Angeles County (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527, 530.)  Where no prejudice is shown to the adverse
party, the liberal rule of allowance prevails.  (Higgins v. Del Faro (1981) 123
Cal.App.3d 558, 564.)
 
Under California Rules of Court (“CRC”), rule
3.1324, a motion for leave to amend a pleading must be accompanied by a
declaration that sets forth: (1) the effect of the amendment; (2) why the
amendment is necessary and proper; (3) when the facts giving rise to the
amended allegations were discovered; and (4) the reasons why the request for
amendment was not made sooner.  (CRC, r.
3.1324(b).)
 
            The
Motion does not comply with the service requirements of CCP section 1005, as it
was filed under 16 court days before the hearing.  In addition, no proof of service was filed,
so it cannot be determined if Defendant received notice of the Motion.  Additionally, the Motion was not filed with a
proof of service.  Due process requires a
party to be fully advised of the issues to be addressed and be given adequate
notice of what facts it must rebut in order to prevail. (Fenn v. Sherriff
(2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 1466, 1482.)  The
Court therefore CONTINUES the Motion to March 19, 2024 to allow Plaintiff to
serve Defendant with the Motion and to give Defendant the opportunity to
respond. 
 
            Moving party is ordered
to give notice of this ruling.
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
 
 
       Dated this 31st day of January 2024
