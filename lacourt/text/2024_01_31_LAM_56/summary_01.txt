Here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motion to bifurcate the discovery related to the FAC and SAXC. The Plaintiff seeks to bifurcate the discovery to avoid the unnecessary expense of duplicative discovery. The Court finds that the discovery connected to the FAC and SAXC do not raise the same issues and therefore would not negatively impact the economy of the litigation. However, the Court denies the Motion because the Plaintiff provides no evidence to support their claim. The Court notes that bifurcation is typically used when the determination of one issue renders other issues moot, but in this case, the issues are not intertwined. The Court also notes that the Plaintiff's motion does not request the relief available under CCP section 1048, which would allow for a bifurcation of the trials on the FAC and SAXC.
