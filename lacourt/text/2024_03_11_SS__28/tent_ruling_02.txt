 Case Number:  21STCV39325    Hearing Date:   March 11, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving, opposing and reply papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
October 25, 2021, Plaintiffs Francisco Rodriguez (“Francisco Rodriguez”), Karla
Rodriguez, and Dyanara Rodriguez (“Dyanara Rodriguez”) filed this action
against Defendants Hung Thanh Bui (“Bui”), JP Transport, Inc. (“JP Transport”),
Dante Lamont Jackson (“Jackson”), and Does 1-100 for motor vehicle negligence
and negligent entrustment. 
On
October 27, 2021, the Court appointed Francisco Rodriguez to serve as guardian
ad litem for minor Dyanara Rodriguez. 
On
March 2, 2023, Bui filed an answer. 
On
March 29, 2023, the Court dismissed Jackson without prejudice at Plaintiffs’
request. 
On
April 4, 2023, the Court granted Bui’s ex parte application to continue the
trial and related dates.  The Court
continued the trial from April 24, 2023 to March 20, 2024 and ruled that
discovery and law and motion cut-off dates would be based on the new trial date. 
On June
13, 2023, Plaintiff amended the complaint to include Defendant Pactrans, LLC as
Doe 1 (“Pactrans”). 
On
July 13, 2023, the clerk entered JP Transport’s default. 
On
July 26, 2023, Pactrans filed an answer. 
On
February 13, 2024, Bui and Pactrans (“Moving Defendants”) filed a motion to continue
the trial and all related dates, to be heard on March 11, 2024.  On February 27, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an
opposition.  On February 28, 2024, Moving
Defendants filed a reply. 
On
February 29, 2024, Moving Defendants filed an ex parte application to continue
the trial and all related dates.  The
same day, Plaintiffs filed an opposition. 
The next day, Moving Defendants filed a reply. 
On
March 1, 2024, the Court continued the trial to May 30, 2024 based on the
parties’ stipulation.  The Court deferred
ruling on Moving Defendants’ request to reopen discovery and related dates to the previously-scheduled March 11, 2024 hearing date. 
Trial
is currently scheduled for May 30, 2024. 
PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Moving
Defendants ask the Court to reopen discovery and order that discovery and
related dates are based on the May 30, 2024 trial date. 
Plaintiffs
ask the Court to deny the motion. 
LEGAL STANDARD  
Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.020 provides: 
“(a) Except
as otherwise provided in this chapter, any party shall be entitled as a matter
of right to complete discovery proceedings on or before the 30th day, and to
have motions concerning discovery heard on or before the 15th day, before the
date initially set for the trial of the action. 
“(b) Except
as provided in Section 2024.050, a continuance or postponement of the trial
date does not operate to reopen discovery proceedings.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020.) 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050 provides: 
“(a) On
motion of any party, the court may grant leave to complete discovery
proceedings, or to have a motion concerning discovery heard, closer to the
initial trial date, or to reopen discovery after a new trial date has been set.
This motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040. 
“(b) In
exercising its discretion to grant or deny this motion, the court shall take
into consideration any matter relevant to the leave requested, including, but
not limited to, the following: 
“(1) The
necessity and the reasons for the discovery. 
“(2) The
diligence or lack of diligence of the party seeking the discovery or the
hearing of a discovery motion, and the reasons that the discovery was not
completed or that the discovery motion was not heard earlier. 
“(3) Any
likelihood that permitting the discovery or hearing the discovery motion will
prevent the case from going to trial on the date set, or otherwise interfere
with the trial calendar, or result in prejudice to any other party. 
“(4) The
length of time that has elapsed between any date previously set, and the date presently
set, for the trial of the action. 
“(c) The
court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to extend or to reopen discovery, unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.050.) 

DISCUSSION              
          Moving Defendants’ motion briefly refers to the need to
depose expert witnesses (Motion pp. 3, 5) but does not separately explain why
the Court should continue or reopen discovery. 
Plaintiffs’ opposition and Moving Defendants’ reply papers provide no
additional information on this issue. 
          The Court lacks the information needed to support an
informed exercise of discretion under Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050,
subdivision (b).  Therefore, the Court
denies the motion to continue or reopen discovery. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES as moot the motion of Defendants Hung Thanh Bui and Pactrans, LLC
to continue the trial. 
The
Court DENIES the motion of Defendants Hung Thanh Bui and Pactrans, LLC to reopen
discovery. 
Moving
parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
parties are ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
