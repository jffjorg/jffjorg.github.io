considered the documents submitted in support of a default judgment, the Court
rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
June 16, 2022, Plaintiff Samuel B. Glassman (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendants Shane Rumkin (“Defendant”) and Does 1-50 for assault and
battery. 
On
June 9, 2023, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing substituted service on
Defendant of a summons, complaint, statement of damages, and other documents on
June 4, 2023. 
On
July 28, 2023, the clerk entered Defendant’s default. 
On
February 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for Court judgment to be heard on
March 11, 2024. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
Samuel B. Glassman asks the Court to enter a default judgment against Defendant
Shane Rumkin and award Plaintiff $1,586,233.04, consisting of $1,585,500.00 in
general damages and $733.04 in costs. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Default judgment 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties and
the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A memorandum
of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A dismissal
of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate
judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure section 579,
supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a).) 
B.   Damages 
          “Where a cause of action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff
merely needs to introduce evidence establishing a prima facie case for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶
5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal. Practice Guide), citing Johnson v. Stanhiser
(1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361 [trial court erred in applying preponderance of the
evidence standard].) 
          The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry of a defendant's
default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or, for personal
injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the amount
listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a), 585,
subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494 (Becker).) The statute insures that “defendants in cases
which involve a default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may
be taken against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is
demanded is taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in
court—a right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p.
493.) A trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of
the amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at
p. 494; see Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 5:258,
p. 5-70.) 
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff’s
Summary of the Case states that Plaintiff listed $10,000,000 in general damages
in his statement of damages.  However, Plaintiff has not submitted a copy of the statement
of damages for the Court’s review. 
Plaintiff or his counsel should submit a declaration attaching copies of any statements of damages that Plaintiff served
on Defendant and proofs of service showing the dates of service. 
In addition,
Plaintiff has not dismissed or applied for separate judgment against the Doe
defendants.  (See Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1800(a)(7).) 
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES without prejudice Plaintiff Samuel B.
Glassman’s application for default judgment against Defendant Shane Rumkin filed
on February 23, 2024. 
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
