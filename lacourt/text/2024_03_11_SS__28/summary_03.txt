And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the moving and opposing papers and rules as follows. Plaintiff Gregory Horatio Sheran filed this action against Defendant Prashanthi Manoharan and others for negligence. Defendant filed an answer on December 13, 2022. Plaintiff then filed motions to compel Defendant's response to requests for production, special interrogatories, and form interrogatories, which are set to be heard on March 11, 2024. Defendant filed an opposition on February 27, 2024.

Plaintiff asserts that he served the requests for production, special interrogatories, and form interrogatories in February 2023, but did not file a reply to Defendant's opposition. Defendant served verified responses to the requests on February 5, 2024. Absent any response from Plaintiff disputing receipt of Defendant's discovery responses, the court denies the motions as moot. Since the motions are denied, sanctions are not available.

The court denies Plaintiff's motions to compel Defendant's responses to the requests for production, special interrogatories, and form interrogatories. The court also denies Plaintiff's requests for sanctions. The moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling, and to file proof of service of this ruling with the court within five days.
