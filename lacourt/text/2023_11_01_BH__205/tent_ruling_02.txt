 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
DEMURRER TO FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT 



 
Background
 
            This case
arises from a breach of contract claim. Plaintiff Pierre Caland alleges that
Defendant Alexander Davis asked Plaintiff to give him $1 million so that
Defendant could buy out his business partner and become the sole owner of a
business entity, DTA II. (FAC ¶ 7.) Defendant promised that he would return the
$1 million if the investment was successful and generated sufficient carried
interest. (FAC ¶ 9.) In addition, Defendant promised that he would pay
Plaintiff the net proceeds from 10% of all carried interest payments that
Defendant receives from DTA II. (FAC ¶ 9.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendant has
not made the repayment to Plaintiff, even though the public sale of stock and
the resulting generation of carried interest for Defendant triggered the
repayment obligation. (FAC ¶ 13.) The FAC further alleges that Defendant began
to concoct a false story for his refusal to pay Plaintiff, telling Plaintiff
that he did not owe Plaintiff money because he inadvertently overpaid him. (FAC
¶ 17.) 
 
            The FAC
alleges the following causes of action: (1) breach of oral agreement, (2)
promissory estoppel, (3) accounting, (4) conversion, (5) equitable lien, and
(6) constructive trust. 
 
            On August
21, 2023, Defendant filed this demurrer to the fourth cause of action for
conversion in the FAC, arguing that the FAC fails to allege Defendant’s
actionable interference with his possessory or ownership interest in the
amounts claimed. 
 
 
Demurrer Standard
 
            “[A] demurrer
tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.” (Lewis v.
Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.) A demurrer can be used only
to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or
from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (See Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 (in ruling on a
demurrer, a court may not consider declarations, matters not subject to
judicial notice, or documents not accepted for the truth of their contents).)
For purposes of ruling on a demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are
assumed to be true, but the reviewing court does not assume the truth of
conclusions of law. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hosp. Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962,
967.)        
 
            Leave to amend
must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. (See Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349 (court
shall not “sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if there is any reasonable
possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment”); Kong v. City of
Hawaiian Gardens Redevelopment Agency (2002) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1037 (“A
demurrer should not be sustained without leave to amend if the complaint,
liberally construed, can state a cause of action under any theory or if there
is a reasonable possibility the defect can be cured by amendment.”).) The
burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be amended
successfully. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)  
 
Analysis
 
            Defendant argues
that the conversion claim fails because Plaintiff has not alleged an actual
interference with Plaintiff’s ownership or right of possession. Defendant argues that a mere contractual right of payment,
without more does not constitute “ownership” or “possession” of the money due.
      
            The elements for
a claim of conversion are: “(1) the plaintiff's ownership or right to
possession of the property; (2) the defendant's conversion by a wrongful act or
disposition of property right; and (3) damages.” (IIG Wireless, Inc. v. Yi (2018)
22 Cal.App.5th 630, 650.)
 
            Normally,
money cannot be converted. (McKell v. Washington Mutual, Inc. (2006) 142
Cal.App.4th 1457, 1491.) But money can be the subject of a conversion action
when a specific sum capable of identification is involved. (See SP
Investment Fund I LLC v. Cattell (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 898, 907.)  
 
The
simple failure to pay money owed does not constitute conversion, otherwise the
tort of conversion would swallow the category of contract claims based on the
“mere contractual right of payment. (Voris v. Lampert (2019) 7 Cal.5th
1141, 1151.) Cases recognizing claims for the conversion of money “typically
involve those who have misappropriated, commingled, or misapplied specific
funds held for the benefit of others.” (Id. at 1152.) These cases
include cases for a claim for a specific monetary distribution from a
partnership that defendant was obliged to hold and distribute to plaintiff, (see
SP Investment, supra, 18 Cal.App.5th at 907), and cases where
defendant withheld a portion of a contracted-for contingent fee. (Weiss v.
Marcus (1975) 51 Cal.App.3d 590, 599.) 
 
Here,
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant asked Plaintiff to give him $1 million so that
Defendant could buy out his business partner and become the sole owner of a
business entity, DTA II. (FAC ¶ 7.) Defendant promised that he would return the
$1 million if the investment was successful and generated sufficient carried
interest. (FAC ¶ 9.) In addition, Defendant promised that he would pay
Plaintiff the net proceeds from 10% of all carried interest payments that
Defendant receives from DTA II. (FAC ¶ 9.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendant has
not made the repayment to Plaintiff, even though the public sale of stock and
the resulting generation of carried interest for Defendant triggered the
repayment obligation. (FAC ¶ 13.) Plaintiff alleges that Plaintiff has a right
to possession of the specific sum of money constituting the carried interest
Defendant was supposed to pay once Palantir went public, and the monies
constituting 10% of the carried interest Defendant received from DTA II. (FAC ¶
36.) Plaintiff alleges that this amount totals $15,129,353. (FAC ¶¶ 36, 40.)
The Complaint alleges that Defendant was holding this sum “for the benefit of
[Plaintiff]” and that Defendant interfered with Plaintiff’s interest by
converting it “to his own use by knowing and intentionally keeping it for
himself.” (FAC ¶ 38.) 
 
            This
is not simply a case where “the defendant has a bank account and owes plaintiff
money.” (Voris, supra, 7 Cal.5th at 1152.) Likewise, this is not
a case such as Voris, where an employer owed an employee wages and the
court found that the services provided by the employee did not create certain
identifiable monies in his employers’ account, thereby having conversion. (Id.
at 1153.) Nor is this case similar to Dallas, where plaintiffs
alleged that defendant’s conduct caused them to lose their store’s goodwill and
the entire franchise and its related assets. (Dallas and Lashmi, Inc. v.
7-Eleven, Inc. (2015) 112 F.Supp.3d 1048, 1060.) Instead, this case is more
similar to SP Investment and Weiss because the parties had a
specific sum ($1 million plus 10% of carried interest) that Defendant
contractually agreed to hold for the benefit of Plaintiff and return to
Plaintiff when certain conditions were met. However, when these conditions were
met, this amount belonged to Plaintiff, but Defendant wrongfully withheld it.  
 
            Plaintiff
has sufficiently alleged conversion. 
 
            Next,
Defendant argues that the conversion claim is barred by the economic loss rule.

 
            “The
economic loss rule requires a purchaser to recover in contract for purely
economic loss due to disappointed expectations, unless he can demonstrate harm
above and beyond a broken contractual promise. Quite simply, the economic loss
rule ‘prevent[s] the law of contract and the law of tort from dissolving one
into the other.” (Robinson Helicopter Co., Inc. v Dana Corp. (2004) 34
Cal.4th 979, 988 (citations omitted).)¿ A tortious breach of contract may be
found when “the breach is accompanied by a traditional common law tort, such as
fraud or conversion.” (Erlich v. Menezes (1999) 21
Cal.4th 551, 553.) 
 
            Because
Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged an actionable tort of conversion, the
conversion claim is not barred by the economic loss rule. As such, Defendant’s
demurrer is overruled. 
 
Conclusion
            Defendant’s demurrer to the fourth cause of action for
conversion is overruled.
