And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Edward B. Moreton, Jr. regarding a hearing on November 1, 2023. The case is between Leon Krous Drilling, Inc. (the plaintiff) and Treetop Development LLC and Aram G. Construction and Aram Madzhinyan (the defendants). The defendants moved to set aside default, which was taken against them on July 27, 2022, for failing to respond to a cross-complaint filed by Treetop. The judge denies the motion, finding that it was filed too late (over six months after the default was taken) and that it is procedurally defective (it does not include a copy of the answer to the cross-complaint). The judge also notes that the law favors a trial on the merits and that doubts in applying Code of Civil Procedure section 473 are resolved in favor of the party seeking relief from default.
