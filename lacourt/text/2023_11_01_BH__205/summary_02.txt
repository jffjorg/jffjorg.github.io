And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendant, Alexander J. Davis, to the fourth cause of action for conversion in the first amended complaint (FAC) filed by the plaintiff, Pierre Caland.

The court rules that the conversion claim is not barred by the economic loss rule, as the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged an actionable tort of conversion. The court also finds that the plaintiff has alleged facts that constitute a conversion, as the defendant has wrongfully withheld a specific sum of money that belonged to the plaintiff.

The court overrules the defendant's demurrer to the fourth cause of action for conversion and allows the plaintiff to amend the complaint to cure any defects.

The ruling is tentative, meaning that it is subject to change after a hearing on November 1, 2023.
