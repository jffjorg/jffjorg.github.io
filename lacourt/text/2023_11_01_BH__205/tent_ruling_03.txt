 Case Number:  22SMCV01773    Hearing Date:   November 1, 2023    Dept:  205 Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205   MITRA H. BRAL,   Plaintiff, v.  KHOSROW SHOUMER, et al.,   Defendants.    Case No.:  22SMCV01773     Hearing Date:  November 1, 2023      [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:   PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR CONTEMPT    AGAINST DEFENDANTS         BACKGROUND This case arises from a dispute between neighbors.  Plaintiff Mitrah Bral owns her home located at 1207 Beverly Estates Drive, Beverly Hills, California 90210 (the “Bral Property”).  Defendants Khosrow Shoumer and Fariba Shoumer, individually and as trustees of the Shoumer Trust, own the property next door, located at 1211 Beverly Estates Drive, Beverly Hills California 90210 (the “Shoumer Property”).    In 2020, Defendants began construction on the Shoumer Property.  During construction, Defendants’ contractors entered into the Bral Property and destroyed Plaintiff’s landscaping and vegetation.  Defendants also removed Plaintiff’s wood fence bordering the Shoumer Property and erected plywood barriers.  Defendants’ construction activities culminated in two block walls and a chain link fence located between the Bral Property and the Shoumer Property.  A land survey shows that the walls and fence are partly on the Bral Property.   On October 7, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against Defendants alleging a single claim for trespass to land.  The Complaint seeks equitable relief in the form of a judicial order requiring Defendants to remove any portion of the block wall encroaching on the Bral Property.    On August 8, 2023, this Court entered a Judgment against Defendants, ordering them to remove any portion of the block wall encroaching on Plaintiff’s property within 30 calendar days of receipt of the Order by certified mail.  Plaintiff sent a copy of the Order, via certified mail and first class mail, on August 10, 2023.   This hearing is on Plaintiff’s motion for an order to show cause re: contempt.  Plaintiff argues Defendants have not complied with the Court’s Order and should therefore be sanctioned.  No opposition was filed as of the posting of this tentative ruling.   LEGAL STANDARD A trial court faced with a willful refusal to obey its orders can take action to punish such disobedience under CCP § 1218, as a form of constructive contempt, which involves acts that occur outside the court’s presence. (In re Liu (1969) 273 Cal.App.2d 135, 139.) Punishment of contempt presupposes quasi-criminal proceedings against the offending party, who is entitled to the procedural safeguards available to those accused of a criminal charge, including due process and a “beyond reasonable doubt” burden of proof on the party seeking the finding of contempt. (Id., at 141-142.)  In such proceedings, the facts essential for establishing contempt are (1) the making of the order, (2) knowledge of the order, (3) ability of the respondent to render compliance, and (4) willful disobedience of the order. (Id., at 140-141.)  A proceeding to adjudicate constructive contempt is customarily initiated by the issuance of an Order to Show Cause (“OSC”) (In re Rose (1949) 90 Cal.App.2d 299, 304 – 305 (governed by the procedures set forth in CCP §§ 1209 to 1222)) (See Allison v. County of Ventura (1977) 68 Cal.App.3d 689, 702.)¿  DISCUSSION    The Court concludes that an OSC re contempt is warranted.  The facts necessary for establishing contempt are present here:  First, the Court issued its Judgment on August 8, 2023.  Second, on August 10, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel sent a copy of the Judgment to Defendants, via certified mail and first class mail.  (Sandoval Decl. ¶ 3.)  Defendants, therefore, had notice of the Judgment.  Third, Defendants were capable of obeying the Judgment.  Defendants have not opposed the motion and thus, have provided no reason why they could not comply with the Court’s order.  Fourth, Defendants have not complied with the Court’s order.  (Id. ¶4.) CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, the Court orders Defendants to show cause why they should not be held in contempt for their refusal to comply with the Court’s August 8, 2023 Judgment.  Hearing on the order to show cause is set for November 16, 2023 at 9:00 a.m.    IT IS SO ORDERED.  DATED: November 1, 2023               ___________________________ Edward B.
