And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is an order to show cause why the defendants, Khosrow Shoumer and Fariba Shoumer, should not be held in contempt for their refusal to comply with the Court's August 8, 2023 Judgment. The Judgment ordered the defendants to remove any portion of the block wall encroaching on the plaintiff's property within 30 calendar days of receipt of the Order. The plaintiff, Mitra H. Bral, sent a copy of the Judgment to the defendants on August 10, 2023, but the defendants failed to comply with the order. The Judge concludes that the facts necessary for establishing contempt are present and orders the defendants to show cause why they should not be held in contempt. The hearing on the order to show cause is scheduled for November 16, 2023 at 9:00 a.m.
