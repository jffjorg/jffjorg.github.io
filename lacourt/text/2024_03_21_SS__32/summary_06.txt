The judge's tentative ruling is on a motion for leave to intervene filed by United Specialty Insurance Company (United) in an action brought by Joshua Mason against Legacy Freight Lines, Humberto Silva, Omar Cortez, and Does 1 to 10. United seeks to intervene and defend the action because it provided liability coverage to Legacy Freight Lines and Humberto Silva for the vehicle involved in the accident. The judge grants the motion, finding that United has a direct interest in the case and that the issues will not be enlarged by intervention. The judge also notes that the defaults against Humberto Silva and Legacy Freight Lines must be set aside before United can file an answer on their behalf.
