And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to quash and stay a deposition notice served by the plaintiff on Red Bull's person most qualified (PMQ) regarding topics related to Defendant Vasquez's pay, incentives, and Red Bull sales quotas. The defendants argue that the information is irrelevant and protected by privacy laws. The plaintiff argues that the information is relevant to whether Vasquez was distracted on the day of the incident due to unreasonable delivery expectations from Red Bull.

The judge finds that the requested information is discoverable and that the defendants' privacy objections are not sufficient to prevent discovery. The judge limits the discovery to the day of the incident and denies the defendants' motion to quash and stay as moot. The judge also grants the defendants' motion for a protective order in part, limiting the discovery to the specific topics requested by the plaintiff.

The judge concludes that the defendants' motion is denied in part and granted in part, and that the defendants shall give notice and file a proof of service of the order.
