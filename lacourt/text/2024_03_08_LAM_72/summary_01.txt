Here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the plaintiff, Moises Perez, has not properly served the defendant, Elizabeth Perez, and therefore the entry of default is vacated. The court sets an OSC (Order to Show Cause) for July 10, 2024, to determine the status of the plaintiff's efforts to properly serve the defendant. The court also notes that the plaintiff has not filed a CIV-100 form seeking default judgment as required. The case involves a property dispute over a residence in South Gate, California, and the plaintiff is seeking default judgment against the defendant. The judge finds that the plaintiff has not met the requirements for default judgment and therefore cannot grant default judgment.
