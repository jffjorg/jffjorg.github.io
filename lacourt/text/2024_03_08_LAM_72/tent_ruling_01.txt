Plaintiff Moises Peres (“Plaintiff”) seeks default judgment
against Defendant Elizabeth Perez (“Defendant”)
 
The Court does not enter a default judgment and further VACATES
the entry of default.  Plaintiff has not
properly served Defendant.  For service of
the Defendant in Mexico, Plaintiff must utilize either the Hague Convention or
the Inter-American Service Convention.
 
The Court sets an OSC re service of process for July 10,
2024 at 8:30 a.m. to determine the status of Plaintiff’s efforts to properly
serve Defendant.  
 
Background
 
This is a property dispute over the residence of Plaintiff
and his wife, Maria Perez (“Maria”) (the Court uses first names only to avoid
confusion, and means no disrespect), at 9506 Deeble St., South Gate, California
90280 (the “Property”). The following facts are taken from the allegations in
the Complaint except where otherwise noted.
 
            Plaintiff
and Maria purchased the Property in 1976. On March 24, 1976, a deed was
recorded, granting title to them as Joint Tenants.
 
            In
2003, Plaintiff had agreed to be the guarantor for his friend’s home, but his
friend did not pay the mortgage, resulting in a requirement that Plaintiff pay
the mortgage instead. Fearing that they would lose their home, Plaintiff and
Maria transferred the Property to their daughter, Defendant Elizabeth Perez, by
a quitclaim deed. Neither Plaintiff nor Maria received anything from Defendant
in exchange for the Property. It was the intent of Plaintiff and Maria at the
time of the transfer that the transfer be temporary. In 2023, Defendant
acknowledged to her sister and Plaintiff’s other daughter, Iris Perez, that the
transfer was intended to be temporary, but stated that she had changed her
mind. (Iris Perez Decl. ¶ 4.)
 
            Defendant
never lived at the Property following the transfer. A few months after the
transfer, Defendant moved to Mexico and has not returned to the United States
since 2003. Plaintiff and Maria continued to live at the Property and continued
to pay the taxes, utilities, and maintenance for the Property.
 
            Plaintiff
filed this action on June 28, 2023, raising claims for (1) quiet title; (2)
slander of title; (3) declaratory relief; and (4) resulting trust.
 
            Default
was entered against Defendant on August 18, 2023.
 
            On
October 31, 2023, Maria transferred her interest in the Property to Plaintiff
through an interspousal transfer. (First Moises Perez Decl. ¶ 13, Ex. E.)
 
            On
January 23, 2024, Plaintiff applied for default judgment against Defendant.
 
Legal Standard
 
CCP § 585 permits entry of a judgment after a Defendant has
failed to timely answer after being properly served.  A party seeking judgment on the default by
the Court must file a Form CIV-100 Request for Court Judgment, and: 
 
(1) Proof of service of the complaint and summons;
(2) A dismissal of
all parties against whom judgment is not sought (including Doe defendants) or
an application for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment (CRC 3.1800(a)(7));
(3) A declaration
of non-military status as to the defendant (typically included in Form CIV-100)
(CRC 3.1800(a)(5));
(4) A brief summary of the case (CRC 3.1800(a)(1)); 
(5) Admissible
evidence supporting a prima facie case for the damages or other relief
requested (Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999)
72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361-362); 
(6) Interest computations as necessary (CRC 3.1800(a)(3)); 
(7) A memorandum of
costs and disbursements (typically included in Form CIV-100 (CRC 3.1800(a)(4));

(8) A request for
attorney’s fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties (CRC
3.1800(a)(9)), accompanied by a declaration stating that the fees were
calculated in accordance with the fee schedule as per Local Rule 3.214.  Where a request for attorney fees is based on
a contractual provision the specific provision must be cited; (Local Rule
3.207); and
(9) A proposed form
of judgment (CRC 3.1800(a)(6));
(10) Where an
application for default judgment is based upon a written obligation to pay
money, the original written agreement should be submitted for cancellation (CRC
3.1806). A trial court may exercise its discretion to accept a copy where the
original document was lost or destroyed by ordering the clerk to cancel the
copy instead (Kahn v. Lasorda's Dugout, Inc. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th
1118, 1124);
(11) Where the
plaintiff seeks damages for personal injury or wrongful death, they must serve
a statement of damages on the defendant in the same manner as a summons (Code
Civ. Proc. § 425.11, subd. (c), (d)).
 
 
(California Rules
of Court rule 3.1800.)
 
Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(a)(1), items are
allowable as costs under Section 1032 if they are “filing, motion, and jury
fees.”
 
A party who defaults only admits facts well pleaded in the
complaint or cross-complaint.  (Molen
v. Friedman (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1149, 1153-1154.)  Thus, the complaint must state a claim for
the requested relief.
             
 
Discussion
 
Service of the Complaint and Summons
 
            Service
was not proper. According to the proof of service, Defendant was personally
served on July 18, 2023 at A Las Montañas 120, Prados Vallarta, 45120, Zapopan,
Jalisco, Mexico.
 
            “The
Hague Service Convention applies to service on a resident of Mexico of a civil
complaint filed within the United States[.]” (In re D.R. (2019) 39
Cal.App.5th 583, 593; Code Civ. Proc., § 413.10, subd. (c); see also 20 U.S.T.
361, Art.1 et seq.)
 
            “The
Hague Convention provides specific procedures to accomplish service of process.
Authorized modes of service are service through a central authority in each
country; service through diplomatic channels; and service by any method
permitted by the internal law of the country where the service is made.” (Honda
Motor Co. v. Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1043, 1045 [internal
citations omitted].) The Inter-American Service Convention also provides an
alternate means for service. (Kreimerman v. Casa Veerkamp, S.A. de C.V.
(5th Cir. 1994) 22 F.3d 634, 642.)
 
            Here,
Plaintiff appears to have executed personal service by normal means under U.S.
law. However, it does not appear that Plaintiff has executed proper service
under the Hague Convention or, alternatively, used the channels provided for in
the Inter-American Service Convention. Thus, the entry of default in this case
was improper. The Court is therefore unable to grant default judgment, and must
vacate the default.
 
Lack of CIV-100
 
The Court further notes that Plaintiff has not filed a
CIV-100 form seeking default judgment as required. Plaintiff submitted a
CIV-100 to obtain entry of default, but must also file a CIV-100 seeking a
court judgment and fill out the relevant portions of the form.
 
Dismissal of Other Parties
 
The Doe defendants have not been dismissed as required.
 
 
Non-Military Status
 
Carina Ochoa avers to the non-military status of Defendant.
 
 
Summary of the Case
 
Plaintiff provides a brief summary of the case in his
Application for Default Judgment By Court and Prove-Up Brief.
 
 
Evidence of Damages
 
Plaintiff does not seek damages or interest.
 
 
Memorandum of Costs and Disbursements
 
Plaintiff does not seek costs.
 
 
Attorney’s Fees
 
            Plaintiff
does not seek attorney’s fees.
 
 
Proposed Form of Judgment
 
            Plaintiff
has not submitted a proposed form of judgment as required.
