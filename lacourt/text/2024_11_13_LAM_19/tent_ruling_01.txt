  Case Number:  23STCV25306    Hearing Date:   November 13, 2024    Dept:  19  TENTATIVE RULING  After consideration of the  briefing filed and oral argument at the hearing, Defendant Hyoung Wook Ko’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees  and Costs is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $7,557.50.  Counsel for Defendant to give notice.  STATEMENT OF THE CASE  This action  arises out of alleged malicious prosecution. Plaintiff Myoung Jin Kang (“Plaintiff”) brings suit against  Defendant Hyoung Wook Ko (“Defendant”) alleging the following causes of action: 1.       Malicious Prosecution; and 2.       Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.  On February 6,  2024, Defendant filed his “Special Motion To Strike Plaintiff's Complaint (Code  Of Civil Procedure Section 425.16)” (the “Anti-SLAPP Motion”), noticed for  hearing on August 19, 2024.  On July 9, 2024,  before the hearing on the Anti-SLAPP Motion, Plaintiff dismissed the action  without prejudice.  On July 18,  2024, Defendant filed the instant Motion  for Attorney’s Fees and Costs (the “Motion”).  GROUNDS FOR MOTION  Pursuant to Code of Civil  Procedure section 425.16, subdivision (c)(1), Defendant moves for an award of  $10,532.50 in attorney’s fees and costs on the ground that it is the prevailing  party on a special motion to strike (anti-SLAPP).  REQUEST FOR  JUDICIAL NOTICE  The Court GRANTS Defendant’s  unopposed request to take judicial notice of Exhibits 1-3. (Evid. Code, §  452(d).)  However, the Court notes that it does not take judicial notice of  the truth of statements or their proper interpretation when the facts are in  dispute. (See Fremont Indem. Co. v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148  Cal.App.4th 97, 113-14 [“Taking judicial notice of a document is not the same  as accepting the truth of its contents or accepting a particular interpretation  of its meaning.”]; StorMedia Inc. v. Sup. Ct. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 449, 457  n. 9 [“When judicial notice is taken of a document ... the truthfulness and  proper interpretation of the document are disputable.”]; see also Cruz v.  County of Los Angeles (1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 1131, 1134 [holding that  judicial notice does not require acceptance of the truth of factual matters  that might be deduced therefrom].)  DISCUSSION  Code of Civil Procedure section  425.16, subdivision (c) provides that:  (1) Except as  provided in paragraph (2), in any action subject to subdivision (b), a prevailing  defendant on a special motion to strike shall be entitled to recover that  defendant’s attorney’s fees and costs. If the court finds that a special motion  to strike is frivolous or is solely intended to cause unnecessary delay, the  court shall award costs and reasonable attorney’s fees to a plaintiff  prevailing on the motion, pursuant to Section 128.5.   (2) A defendant  who prevails on a special motion to strike in an action subject to paragraph  (1) shall not be entitled to attorney’s fees and costs if that cause of action  is brought pursuant to Section 11130, 11130.3, 54960, or 54960.1 of the Government  Code, or pursuant to Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 7923.100) of Part 4 of  Division 10 of Title 1 of the Government Code. Nothing in this paragraph shall  be construed to prevent a prevailing defendant from recovering attorney’s fees  and costs pursuant to Section 7923.115, 11130.5, or 54960.5 of the Government  Code. (Code Civ. Proc., §  425.16(c)(1).)  I.                    ENTITLEMENT TO FEES AND COSTS  For the following reasons, the Court finds that  Defendant is entitled to recover his reasonable attorney’s fees and costs  pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16, subdivision (c).  As an initial matter, the instant  action is not one of the actions enumerated in Code of Civil Procedure section  425.16, subdivision (c)(2).  Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed  the action after the Anti-SLAPP Motion was filed but before the motion was  heard.  As correctly argued by Defendant,  if a plaintiff voluntarily dismisses the action after a special motion to  strike is filed, the trial court retains jurisdiction to decide whether to  award attorney fees and costs to the defendant, (Law Offices of Andrew L.  Ellis v. Yang (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 869, 877-879), with the defendant  being entitled to recover attorney’s fees and costs if it is determined that  the defendant would have prevailed on the motion. (Tourgeman v. Nelson &  Kennard (2014) 222 Cal.App.4th 1447, 1456-1458.)  Thus, the Court proceeds to  determine whether Defendant would have prevailed on the Anti-SLAPP Motion.  A.     Legal Standards  Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16,  subdivision (b)(1): “A cause of action against a person arising from any act of  that person in furtherance of the person's right of petition or free speech  under the United States Constitution or the California Constitution in  connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,  unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a  probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.” (Code Civ. Proc., §  425.16(b)(1).) “In making its determination, the court shall consider the  pleadings, and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which  the liability or defense is based.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16(b)(2).)  Under the anti-SLAPP statute, an “act in furtherance of a  person's right of petition or free speech under the United States or California  Constitution in connection with a public issue” includes: “(1) any written or  oral statement or writing made before a legislative, executive, or judicial  proceeding, or any other official proceeding authorized by law, (2) any written  or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under  consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any  other official proceeding authorized by law, (3) any written or oral statement  or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection  with an issue of public interest, or (4) any other conduct in furtherance of  the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional  right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public  interest.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 425.16(e); see also Equilon Ent., LLC v.  Consumer Cause, Inc. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 53, 66.)  1.      Moving Defendant’s Initial Burden  A moving defendant has the initial burden to demonstrate  that a cause of action is subject to a special motion to strike. (Martinez  v. Metabolife Inter. Ins. (2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 181, 186; Fox  Searchlight Pictures Inc. v. Paladino (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 294, 304.)  Specifically, courts decide whether a moving defendant has made a prima facie  showing that the attacked claims arise from a protected activity, including  defendants’ right of petition or free speech. (See, e.g., Healy v.  Tuscany Hills Landscape & Recreation Corp., (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 1,  5; Soukup v. Law Offices of Herbert Hafif (2006) 39 Cal.4th 260, 278;  Code Civ. Proc. § 425.16(e).) “[A] moving defendant's burden to show a cause of  action arising from is not met simply by showing that the label of the lawsuit  appears to involve the rights of free speech or petition; he or she must  demonstrate that the substance of the plaintiff's cause of action was an act in  furtherance of the right of petition or free speech.” (Jespersen v. Zubiate-Beauchamp (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 624, 630.)  “The sole inquiry under the first prong of the anti-SLAPP statute is whether  the plaintiff's claims arise from protected speech or petitioning activity.” (Castleman  v. Sagaser (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 481, 490 (citing Coretronic Corp. v.  Cozen O'Connor (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 1381, 1389); see Feldman v. 1100 Park Lane Associates (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 1467,  1478 [“The critical consideration is whether the cause of action is based on  the defendant's protected free speech or petitioning activity.”].)  “At this first step, courts are to ‘consider the elements  of the challenged claim and what actions by the defendant supply those elements  and consequently form the basis for liability.’” (Bonni v. St. Joseph Health  System (2021) 11 Cal.5th 995, 1009 (quoting Park v. Board of Trustees of California State University (2017) 2 Cal.5th 1057, 1063).) “The  defendant's burden is to identify what acts each challenged claim rests on and  to show how those acts are protected under a statutorily defined category of  protected activity.” (Id. (citing Wilson v. Cable News Network, Inc.  (2019) 7 Cal.5th 871, 884).)  The California Supreme Court in Bonni held that,  in evaluating anti-SLAPP motions directed to an entire cause of action or  complaint, each allegation of protected activity must be evaluated separately,  with the moving defendant bearing the burden of showing that each allegation  supporting a claim of recovery is one that rests on protected activity. (Id.  at 1010-1013.) “Assertions that are ‘merely incidental’ or ‘collateral’ are not  subject to section 425.16. Allegations of protected activity that merely provide  context, without supporting a claim for recovery, cannot be stricken under the  anti-SLAPP statute.” (Baral v. Schnitt (2016) 1 Cal.5th 376, 394;  accord, Bonni, supra, 11 Cal.5th at 1012.)  2.      Opposing Party’s Burden  If the moving party successfully shifts the burden, then  the opposing party must demonstrate a probability of prevailing on the merits  of the complaint. (Equilon Ent., supra, 29 Cal.4th at 67; Code  Civ. Proc. § 425.16(b)(1).)  “To establish a probability of prevailing, the plaintiff ‘must  demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a  sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the  evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.’” (Soukup, supra, 39  Cal.4th at 291 (quoting Matson v. Dvorak (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 539,  548); accord, Rosenaur v. Scherer (2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 260, 274; see Navellier  v. Sletten (2002) 29 Cal.4th 82, 88–89 (internal citations and quotations  omitted) [“As we have previously observed, in order to establish the requisite  probability of prevailing, the plaintiff need only have stated and  substantiated a legally sufficient claim. Put another way, the plaintiff must  demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a  sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the  evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.”].)  “As to the second step inquiry, a plaintiff seeking to  demonstrate the merit of the claim ‘may not rely solely on its complaint, even  if verified; instead, its proof must be made upon competent admissible  evidence.’” (Sweetwater Union High School Dist. v. Gilbane Building Co.  (2019) 6 Cal.5th 931, 940 (quoting San Diegans for Open Government v. San  Diego State University Research Foundation (2017) 13 Cal.App.5th 76, 95);  see Finton Construction, Inc. v. Bidna & Keys, APLC (2015) 238  Cal.App.4th 200, 213 [“An anti-SLAPP motion is an evidentiary motion. Once the  court reaches the second prong of the analysis, it must rely on admissible  evidence, not merely allegations in the complaint or conclusory statements by  counsel.”]; Tuchscher Development Enterprises, Inc. v. San Diego Unified  Port Dist. (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 1219, 1237 (quoting College Hospital  Inc. v. Superior Court (1994) 8 Cal.4th 704, 719) [anti-SLAPP motion “requires  the plaintiff to demonstrate that he possesses a legally sufficient claim which  is ‘substantiated,’ that is, supported by competent, admissible evidence.”].)  This burden is somewhat akin to that required to resist a  nonsuit or to move for summary judgment,” (1-800 Contacts, Inc. v. Steinberg  (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 568, 584 (internal citation omitted)), and therefore  “[t]he standard for determining the merits of a defendant's special motion to  strike a complaint is similar to that for determining the merits of a  defendant's motion for summary judgment. ‘Both seek to determine whether a  prima facie case has been presented by [the] plaintiff in opposing the motions.’”  (Kenne v. Stennis (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 953, 963 (quoting Bergman v.  Drum (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 11, 18) (citing with approval Weil & Brown,  Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2014) ¶  7:1008, p. 7(II)–57 (rev. # 1, 2014) [“The ‘probability of prevailing’ is  tested by the same standard governing a motion for summary judgment, nonsuit,  or directed verdict”]).) “If a plaintiff sets forth a prima facie case in  opposition to such motions, the motions must be denied.” (Id.)  “The court does not, however, weigh that evidence against  the plaintiff's, in terms of either credibility or persuasiveness. Rather, the  defendant's evidence is considered with a view toward whether it defeats the  plaintiff's showing as a matter of law, such as by establishing a defense or  the absence of a necessary element.” (1-800 Contacts, Inc., supra,  107 Cal.App.4th at 585.) “An [opposing party] cannot simply rely on his or her  pleadings, even if verified. Rather, the [opposing party] must adduce competent,  admissible evidence.” (Hailstone v. Martinez (2008) 169 Cal.App.4th 728,  735.) “[T]he court may only consider the opposing evidence to determine if it  defeats the plaintiff's showing as a matter of law.” (Colt v. Freedom  Communications, Inc. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 1551, 1557 (internal quotation  and citation omitted).)  “[I]n order to defeat a special motion to strike, a  plaintiff need only present sufficient evidence showing ‘a case of ‘minimal  merit.’’” (GetFugu, Inc. v. Patton Boggs LLP (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 141,  155 (quoting Grewal v. Jammu (2011) 191 Cal.App.4th 977, 989).)  B.      Analysis  1.       Defendant’s Initial Burden  Defendant’s Anti-SLAPP Motion was  directed to the entirety of the Complaint, arguing that both the First and  Second Causes of Action “fall squarely within the Anti-SLAPP statute.”  (Anti-SLAPP Motion, p. 4.)  In the Complaint both the First  and Second Causes of Action are premised upon the allegations that Defendant  filed a previous action, Case No. 20STCV17221 (the “Prior Action”), against  Plaintiff despite having no reasonable grounds or probable cause to do so and  for an improper purpose, knowing that Plaintiff was not liable for the  allegations in the Prior Action that she helped co-defendants fabricate marital  documents. (Compl., ¶¶ 7-21.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendant’s malicious  prosecution of Case No. 20STCV17221 harmed her reputation and caused her to  suffer serious emotional distress and mental suffering. (Id. at ¶¶  22-25.)  The Court finds that Defendant  would have prevailed in showing that both the First and Second Causes of Action  arise out of protected activity and are subject to a special motion to strike.  “The Supreme Court has said  that ‘plainly read, section 425.16 encompasses any cause of action against a  person arising from any statement or writing made in, or in connection with an  issue under consideration or review by, an official proceeding or body.’” (Benasra  v. Mitchell Silberberg & Knupp LLP (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 1179, 1184  (quoting Briggs v. Eden Council for Hope & Opportunity (1999) 19  Cal.4th 1106, 1113).) “The court has also observed that ‘[n]othing in the  statute itself categorically excludes any particular type of action from its  operation.’” (Id. (quoting Navellier, supra, 29 Cal.4th at 92).)  “‘It is beyond dispute the filing of a complaint is an exercise of the  constitutional right of petition and falls under section 425.16.’” (Kolar v.  Donahue, McIntosh & Hammerton (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 1532, 1537  (quoting A.F. Brown Electrical Contractor, Inc. v. Rhino Electric Supply,  Inc. (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 1118, 1125).)  “The anti-SLAPP protection  for petitioning activities applies not only to the filing of lawsuits, but  extends to conduct that relates to such litigation, including statements made  in connection with or in preparation of litigation.” (Id. (citing Kashian  v. Harriman (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 892, 908).) “Indeed, courts have adopted  ‘a fairly expansive view of what constitutes litigation-related activities  within the scope of section 425.16.’” (Id. (quoting Kashian, supra,  98 Cal.App.4th at 908).)  “Although a party's  litigation-related activities constitute ‘act[s] in furtherance of a person's  right of petition or free speech,’ it does not follow that any claims  associated with those activities are subject to the anti-SLAPP statute. To  qualify for anti-SLAPP protection, the moving party must demonstrate the claim  ‘arises from’ those activities. A claim ‘arises from’ an act when the act  ‘forms the basis for the plaintiff's cause of action’ ....’” (Id.  (quoting Equilon Enterprises, supra, 29 Cal.4th at 66).) “‘[T]he  ‘arising from’ requirement is not always easily met.’” (Ibid.) “A cause  of action may be ‘triggered by’ or associated with a protected act, but it does  not necessarily mean the cause of action arises from that act. (Id.  (quoting City of Cotati v. Cashman (2002) 29 Cal.4th 69, 77–78).)  “‘California courts rightly have rejected the notion ‘that a lawsuit is  adequately shown to be one ‘arising from’ an act in furtherance of the rights  of petition or free speech as long as suit was brought after the defendant  engaged in such an act, whether or not the purported basis for the suit is that  act itself.’” (Id. at 1537-1538 (quoting City of Cotati, supra,  29 Cal.4th at 77); see City of Cotati, supra, 29 Cal.4th at 78  [“In short, the statutory phrase ‘cause of action ... arising from’ means  simply that the defendant's act underlying the plaintiff's cause of action must  itself have been an act in furtherance of the right of petition or free  speech.”].)  Here, the Court concludes  that Plaintiff’s claims arise from Defendant’s protected litigation-related  activities “because ‘[b]y definition, a malicious prosecution suit alleges that  the defendant committed a tort by filing a lawsuit.’” (Kolar, supra,  145 Cal.App.4th at 716 (quoting Jarrow Formulas, Inc. v. LaMarche (2003)  31 Cal.4th 728, 735).) Indeed, “every Court of Appeal that has addressed the  question has concluded that malicious prosecution causes of action fall within  the purview of the anti-SLAPP statute. (Jarrow, supra, 31 Cal.4th  at 735 (citing White v. Lieberman (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 210, 220–221; Mattel,  Inc. v. Luce, Forward, Hamilton & Scripps (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1179,  1188; Chavez v. Mendoza (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 1083, 1087–1088); accord, Maleti  v. Wickers (2022) 82 Cal.App.5th 181, 200–201 (internal citations and  quotations omitted) [“…since the essence of the tort of abuse of process ...  [is] some misuse of process in a prior action[,] ... it is hard to imagine an  abuse of process claim that would not fall under the protection of the  [anti-SLAPP] statute.”].)  Plaintiff argues that that her  claims in the instant action do not arise out of protected activity because  they are not in connection  with a public issue or an issue of public interest. (Opposition, pp. 5-7.)  The Court rejects this argument. While “any written or  oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum  in connection with an issue of public interest, or… any other conduct in  furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the  constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an  issue of public interest,” is included within the scope of the anti-SLAPP  statute, (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16(e)(3), (4)), as correctly argued by  Defendant, (Reply, p. 2), the anti-SLAPP statute protects a party's litigation-related activities whether or not the activity  involves a public issue  or an issue of public interest. (Briggs, supra, 19 Cal.4th at  1116 [“Under the plain terms of the statute it is the context or setting itself  that makes the issue a public issue: all that matters is that the First  Amendment activity take place in an official proceeding or be made in  connection with an issue being reviewed by an official proceeding.”]; id.  at 1118 [“Any matter pending before an official  proceeding possesses some measure of “public significance” owing solely to the  public nature of the proceeding, and free discussion of such matters furthers  effective exercise of the petition rights section 425.16 was intended to  protect. The Legislature's stated intent is best served, therefore, by a  construction of section 425.16 that broadly encompasses participation in  official proceedings, generally, whether or not such participation remains  strictly focused on “public” issues.”].)  Plaintiff also argues that,  in the Prior Action, Defendant “knowingly ignored and flatly denied”  Plaintiff’s continuous request to dismiss the Prior Action. (Opposition at pp.  6-7.) However, Plaintiff fails to explain how that compels the conclusion that  Defendant would not have prevailed on the Anti-SLAPP motion or that the instant  Motion must be denied. The fact that Defendant declined to dismiss the Prior  Action does not compel the conclusion that the instant action is not subject to  a special motion to strike.  For the foregoing reasons,  the Court finds that Defendant would have sustained his initial burden to  demonstrate that Plaintiff’s claims are subject to a special motion to strike.  2.      Plaintiff’s Burden  Finally, the Court finds  that Plaintiff would fail  to sustain her burden to demonstrate  a probability of prevailing on the merits of her claims. Plaintiff did not file  any evidence in opposition to the Anti-SLAPP Motion because she dismissed the  instant action before filing any opposition papers.  Plaintiff also failed to  file any evidence in opposition to the instant Motion.  Since Plaintiff was  required to produce competent,  admissible evidence in order to sustain her burden, (see Hailstone, supra,  169 Cal.App.4th at 735), but failed to do so, the Court finds that Defendant would have prevailed on the  Anti-SLAPP Motion.  Accordingly, for all the foregoing reasons, the Court  finds that Defendant is entitled to recover his attorney’s fees and costs  pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16, subdivision (c)(1) and  proceeds to address the reasonableness of the requested fees.  II.                 REASONABLENESS OF FEES  A.     Legal Standards  As explained by the Court of Appeal in Christian  Research Institute v. Alnor (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315:  A trial court assessing attorney fees  begins with a touchstone or lodestar figure, based on the careful compilation  of the time spent and reasonable hourly compensation of each attorney ...  involved in the presentation of the case. The court tabulates the attorney fee  touchstone, or lodestar, by multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended  by the reasonable hourly rate prevailing in the community for similar work.  [T]he lodestar figure may be increased or decreased depending on a variety of  factors, including the contingent nature of the fee award. …absent  circumstances rendering the award unjust, an attorney fee award should  ordinarily include compensation for all the hours reasonably spent, including  those relating solely to the fee. … ‘padding’ in the form of inefficient or  duplicative efforts is not subject to compensation.  (Id. at 1321 (internal citations and quotations  omitted).   A party requesting a fee award “‘is not necessarily  entitled to compensation for the value of attorney services according to [his]  own notion or to the full extent claimed by [him].’” (Levy v. Toyota  Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 807, 816 (quoting Salton  Bay Marina, Inc. v. Imperial Irrigation Dist. (1985) 172 Cal.App.3d  914, 950) (internal citation omitted).)  The party seeking attorney fees and costs “bear[s] the  burden of establishing entitlement to an award and documenting the appropriate  hours expended and hourly rates” to show that the fees incurred were allowable  and reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation. (Christian Research  Institute, supra, 165 Cal.App.4th at 1320 (internal citations and  quotations omitted); see Levy, supra, 4 Cal.App.4th at 816.)  “To that end, the court may require [a]  defendant[ ] to produce records sufficient to provide a proper basis for  determining how much time was spent on particular claims.” (Ibid.) “The  court also may properly reduce compensation on account of any failure to  maintain appropriate time records.” (Id. (internal citation omitted)  (quoting ComputerXpress, Inc. v. Jackson (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 993, 1020).)  “The evidence should allow the court to consider whether the case was  overstaffed, how much time the attorneys spent on particular claims, and  whether the hours were reasonably expended.” (Id. (citing ComputerXpress,  Inc., supra, 93 Cal.App.4th at 1020).)  A trial court has broad discretion to award attorney fees  in an amount that is less than the lodestar amount and, to discourage claimants  from making an unreasonable demand, may deny altogether a fee request that  appears unreasonably inflated. (Id. at 1321-1322; see Serrano v.  Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 635.)  “The basis for the trial court's calculation must be the  actual hours counsel has devoted to the case, less those that result from  inefficient or duplicative use of time.” (Horsford v. Board Of Trustees Of  California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 395.) “The law is  clear, however, that an award of attorney fees may be based on counsel's  declarations, without production of detailed time records.” (Raining Data  Corp. v. Barrenechea (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1363, 1375.) “[T]he verified  time statements of the attorneys, as officers of the court, are entitled to  credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are erroneous.” (Horsford,  supra at 396; City of Colton v. Singletary  (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 751, 785 (same).) “‘In  challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many hours of work are  claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point to the specific  items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to the evidence.  General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do  not suffice. Failure to raise specific challenges in the trial court forfeits  the claim on appeal.’” (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230  Cal.App.4th 459, 488 (quoting Premier Medical Management Systems, Inc. v.  California Ins. Guarantee Assn. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564).)  “[T]he trial court is in the best  position to value the services rendered by the attorneys in his or her  courtroom, and this includes the determination of the hourly rate that will be  used in the lodestar calculus.” (569 East County Boulevard LLC v.  Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc. (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 426, 436-437  (internal citation omitted); see, e.g., Wilkerson v. Sullivan (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 443, 448 [“The reasonableness of  attorney fees is within the discretion of the trial court, to be determined from  a consideration of such factors as the nature of the litigation, the complexity  of the issues, the experience and expertise of counsel and the amount of time  involved. The court may also consider whether the amount requested is based  upon unnecessary or duplicative work.”]; Christian Research  Institute, supra, 165 Cal.App.4th at 1321-1322 [ascertaining the amount of  attorney’s fees to be awarded is left to the sound discretion of the trial  court and the trial court need not simply award the sum requested].)  In setting the hourly rate  for an attorney fees award, courts are entitled to consider the rate of “fees  customarily charged by that attorney and others in the community for similar  work.” (Bihun v. AT&T Information Systems, Inc. (1993) 13 Cal. App.  4th 976, 997, overruled on other grounds by Lakin v. Watkins Associated  Indus. (1993) 6 Cal. 4th 644, 664; see also Heritage Pacific Financial,  LLC v. Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 1009 [“[R]ate determinations in  other cases, particularly those setting a rate for the plaintiffs' attorney,  are satisfactory evidence of the prevailing market rate.”].) “In making  its calculation, the court may rely on its own knowledge and familiarity with  the legal market, as well as the experience, skill, and reputation of the  attorney requesting fees, the difficulty or complexity of the litigation to  which that skill was applied, and affidavits from other attorneys regarding  prevailing fees in the community and rate determinations in other cases.” (569  East County Boulevard LLC, supra, 6 Cal.App.5th at 437 (internal citations  omitted).)  Finally, in the context of a special motion to strike, a  party entitled to fees and costs pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section  425.16 is limited to recovering only those fees and costs incurred on the  special motion to strike, (Lafayette Morehouse, Inc. v. Chronicle Pub. Co.  (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1383), and a prevailing defendant is only entitled  to such fees as the court deems reasonable. (Robertson v. Rodriguez  (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 347, 362 [“We readily conclude section 425.16… authorizes  an award of reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party, irrespective of  whether the prevailing party is the plaintiff or the defendant.”].)  B.     Analysis  Defendant requests $4,462.50 in  attorney’s fees incurred in connection with the Anti-SLAPP Motion and $5,950.00  in attorney’s fees incurred in connection with the instant Motion, for a  lodestar totaling $10,412.50. (Motion at p. 9.)  1.      Hourly Rates  Defendant requests that the Court award an hourly rate of  $595.00. (Id.)  After consideration of the declaration of Sam M.  Muriella, which sets forth evidence of counsel’s experience and rate  determinations in other cases, (Sam  M. Muriella Decl., ¶¶ 7-9), and relying on the Court’s own knowledge and  familiarity with the legal market, the Court determines that $595.00 per hour  is reasonable.  2.      Time Spent  i.                     $4,462.50 [Fees Incurred In Connection With Anti-SLAPP Motion]  Defendant’s counsel attests that he “spent ¿a) no less than 0.5 hours reviewing  and analyzing Plaintiffs Complaint; b) no less than 2.0 hours conducting  research per preparation of Defendant’s Special Motion to Strike; and c) no  less than 5.0 hours preparing Defendant’s Special Motion to Strike,” (Muriella  Decl. at ¶ 4), for a total of not less than 7.5 hours (7.5 x $595 = $4,462.50.)  Plaintiff contends that these fees are “excessive” given  that Plaintiff dismissed the action. (Opposition at pp. 7-8.)  After review of the Anti-SLAPP Motion papers, the Court  finds that 7.5 hours were reasonably expended by Defendant in drafting and  filing the Anti-SLAPP Motion. Plaintiff did not dismiss the action until after  the Anti-SLAPP Motion was filed, and failed to assert any other cognizable  argument as to why the 7.5 hours requested are unreasonable or excessive.  ii.                   $5,950.00 [Fees Incurred In Connection  With The Instant Motion]  As stated above, in the context of a special  motion to strike, a party entitled to fees and costs pursuant to Code of Civil  Procedure section 425.16 is limited to recovering only those fees and costs  incurred on the special motion to strike. Thus, the issue is whether fees  incurred in drafting the instant Motion are “incurred on the special motion to  strike.” Plaintiff contends that such fees are “not mandatory and cannot be  awarded,” but fails to clearly or adequately explain why. Since the instant  Motion is brought pursuant to CCP 425.16 and seeks to recover fees incurred on  the Anti-SLAPP Motion, Defendant is also entitled to reasonable fees  incurred in drafting the instant Motion, especially since Defendant needed to  show that he would have prevailed on the Anti-SLAPP Motion had Plaintiff not  dismissed the action.  With respect to the $5,950.00 requested for fees incurred  on the instant Motion, Plaintiff argues that such fees are “not mandatory and  cannot be awarded.” (Opposition at p. 8.) However, Plaintiff fails to clearly  or adequately explain why Defendant cannot recover reasonable fees incurred on  the instant Motion.  The Court finds that Defendant is also entitled to  recover reasonable fees incurred on the instant Motion because it is seeking to  recover the fees incurred on the Anti-SLAPP Motion and requires Defendant to  show that he would have prevailed on the Anti-SLAPP Motion had Plaintiff not  dismissed the action.  Defendant’s counsel attests that he “s¿pent no less than 6.0 hours preparing  the instant Motion for Attorney’s Fees and Costs,” and anticipates “spending no  less than 1.0 hour reviewing and analyzing Plaintiffs opposition, no less than  1.5 hours preparing a reply, no less than 0.5 hours preparing for the hearing  and no less than 1.0 hour appearing (via LA Court Connect) at the hearing on  Defendant’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees,” for a total of no less than 10 hours.  The Court finds the 6.0 hours requested for preparing the  instant Motion to be excessive and unreasonable in light of the fact that the  entirety of pages 4 through 8 of the instant Motion were copied and pasted from  the Anti-SLAPP Motion. (See Anti-SLAPP Motion at pp. 3-8.) The Court already  awarded Defendant fees for drafting the Anti-SLAPP Motion.  The Court finds that 2.0 hours, rather than the requested  6.0 hours, represents a reasonable amount of time to draft what was not copied  and pasted from the Anti-SLAPP Motion, namely, the Notice of Motion, (Motion at  pp. 1-2), the “Case Background,” (id. at p. 3), the calculation and  conclusion on page 9, and the declaration of Sam. M. Muriella.  The Court also finds the 2.5 hours requested to review  the Opposition and prepare the Reply to be excessive. The Opposition does not  cite to any case authority, only cites to Code of Civil Procedure section  425.16, and repeats arguments. (See, generally, Opposition.) The Reply is less  than three (3) pages, with almost a full page of legal authority cited and  discussed in the Anti-SLAPP Motion.  The Court finds that 1.5 hours, rather than the requested  2.5 hours, represents a reasonable amount of time to review the Opposition and  prepare the Reply.  However, the Court finds the 1.5 hours requested to  prepare for and attend the hearing to be reasonable. As such, the Court reduces  the requested lodestar by $2,975.00 (5.0 x $595.00 = $2,975.00.)  Accordingly, for all the  foregoing reasons, the Court awards Defendant attorney’s fees in the reduced  amount of $7,437.50 ($10,412.50  (requested lodestar) - $2,975.00 = $7,437.50.)  III.              COSTS  Defendant also requests $120.00 in costs, representing a  $60.00 filing fee for the Anti-SLAPP Motion and a $60.00 filing fee for the  instant Motion.  Plaintiff does not contest these costs, and the Court  finds that Defendant is entitled to recover these costs.  Thus, the Court awards $120.00 in costs.  Based on all the foregoing, the Court GRANTS the Motion  in the reduced amount of $7,557.50 ($7,437.50 + $120.00 = $7,557.50.)  Defendant to give notice. .
