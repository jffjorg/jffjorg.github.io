And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of Counsel, Shumener, Odson & Oh LLP, to be relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff E D B Construction Management, Inc. The motion was filed due to the termination of the attorney-client relationship by the client on October 7, 2024. The judge finds that good cause exists for Counsel's withdrawal and that such withdrawal will not prejudice the client or any other party. The judge orders Counsel to serve the signed order on the client and notes that Counsel is not relieved until proof of service of the signed order is filed. The judge sets a status conference for January 15, 2025, to determine the legal representation of the plaintiff, a corporation, which may only appear through legal counsel.
