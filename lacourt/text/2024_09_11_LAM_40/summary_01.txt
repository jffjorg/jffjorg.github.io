And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling dismisses a motion filed by Michael Lambert, assignee of record, to deem admitted the truth of facts and genuineness of documents, impose monetary sanctions, and vacate invalid orders/direct levying officer to execute writ in a case that has already been dismissed with prejudice. The action was dismissed on December 6, 2023, and the court found it to be a sham, initiated and/or maintained without proper basis or procedure. The court has also ordered that no further writs be issued in the case. The motion is denied because there is no basis for any discovery in the case, and the court will not take any further action in the matter until the two orders above are addressed. The court also warns that if Michael Lambert continues to file repeated meritless motions in the case, he may be declared a vexatious litigant under California Code of Civil Procedure section 391.7.
