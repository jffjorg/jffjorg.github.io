  - "Leave to amend may also be properly denied when 'the insufficiency of the proposed amendment is established by controlling precedent and ... [can]not be cured by further appropriate amendment.'"
  - "The FAXC does not introduce new facts. The additional causes of action only ask for an allocation of fault. Thus, even though trial is less than two weeks away, no additional discovery is needed to respond to the FAXC."
```

Summary:

The tentative ruling is about a motion for leave to amend and file a First Amended Cross-Complaint. The Cross-Complainant, Hilda Tahmasian, seeks to add additional causes of action for equitable indemnity, equitable contribution, and declaratory relief. The court finds that the procedural requirements for leave to amend have been met, and that the additional causes of action do not introduce new facts, only asking for an allocation of fault. Therefore, the court grants the motion and allows the Cross-Complainant to file the First Amended Cross-Complaint.
