I.        INTRODUCTION
This case
arises out of breach of contract dispute between Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant H
& H Builders and Restoration, Inc. (“H & H”) and Defendant/Cross-Complainant
Formosa Plaza, LLC (“Formosa”). In its Complaint, H & H alleged it was not
paid for construction work performed for Formosa; in its Cross-Complaint,
Formosa alleges H & H did not complete the agreed upon work. (See Complaint,
¶¶ 6-10; Cross-Complaint, ¶¶ 26-30.) 
H & H
demurred to the second, third, and fourth causes of action of Formosa’s
Cross-Complaint alleging violations of Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200, et seq.,
fraud, and negligence, respectively. The Court sustained that demurrer with
leave to amend. Formosa filed a First Amended Cross-Complaint (“FACC”). H &
H now seeks to demurrer Formosa’s FACC as to the same causes of action.
II.      PROCEDURAL
HISTORY
On November
14, 2023, H & H filed its Complaint, alleging (1) Breach of Contract, (2)
Reasonable Value of Services and Materials Received, and (3) Foreclosure on
Mechanics Lien against Formosa.
On December
6, 2023, H & H filed a Notice of Lis Pendens. 
On March 27,
2024, Formosa filed its Answer. 
On March 27,
2024, Formosa also filed a Cross-Complaint, alleging (1) Breach of Contract,
(2) Violation of Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200, et seq., (3) Fraud, and (4)
Negligence against H & H.
On June 25,
2024, the Court sustained H & H’s demurrer with leave to amend.
On July 26,
2024, Formosa timely filed its FACC.
On August 21,
2024, H & H filed the instant Demurrer to Formosa’s First Amended
Cross-Complaint. Formosa timely filed its Opposition. 
III.     LEGAL
STANDARD
A demurrer is a pleading used to test
the legal sufficiency of other pleadings. It raises issues of law, not
fact, regarding the form or content of the opposing party’s pleading
(complaint, answer or cross-complaint). (See Code of Civ. Proc. §§
422.10, 589; see Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116
Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)[1] It
is not the function of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the
complaint; and for purposes of the ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in
the complaint are assumed to be true. (See Donabedian, 116 Cal.App.4th
at 994.) 
“We treat the demurrer as admitting all
material facts properly pleaded but not contentions, deductions or conclusions
of fact or law. We accept the factual allegations of the complaint as true and
also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.” (Mitchell v.
California Department of Public Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007
(citation omitted); see also Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co.
(1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604 [“the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed
to be true, however improbable they may be”].) Allegations are to be liberally
construed. (See Code of Civ. Proc. § 452.) A demurrer may be brought if
insufficient facts are stated to support the cause of action asserted. (See
Code of Civ. Proc. § 430.10(e).)  
A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a
complaint as a matter of law.”  (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010)
183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.) “[T]he court gives the complaint a reasonable
interpretation, and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded.” (Id.) In testing the sufficiency of the
complaint, the court must assume the truth of (1) the properly pleaded factual
allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably inferred from those expressly
pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (See Blank v. Kirwan (1985)
39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence
or other extrinsic matters. (See SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984)
153 Cal.App. 3d 902, 905.) No other extrinsic evidence can be
considered. (See Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d
868, 881 [error for court to consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting
demurrer]; see also Afuso v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co.
(1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862 [disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal
v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d 287] [error to consider
contents of release not part of court record].) Accordingly, “[w]hether
the plaintiff will be able to prove the pleaded facts is irrelevant to ruling
upon the demurrer.” (Stevens v. Superior Court (1986) 180
Cal.App.3d 605, 609-10.) 
A demurrer can only be sustained when
it disposes of an entire cause of action. (See Poizner v. Fremont
General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of Hawaiian
Gardens Redev. Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.) Leave to
amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. (See Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The
burden is on the complainant to show the Court a pleading can be amended
successfully. (Id.) However, “[i]f there is any reasonable possibility
that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to sustain a
demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).  
IV.     MEET AND CONFER
Before
filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party shall meet
and confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference with the party
who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of
determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a),
emphasis added.) A declaration must be filed with a demurrer regarding the
results of the meet and confer process. (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a)(3).) 
          H & H filed a second declaration
attesting to the parties’ telephonic meet and confer and unsuccessful attempt
to resolve the deficiencies in the FACC. (See Declaration of Kyle
Case filed August 21, 2024, ¶¶
9-18.) The
Court finds the parties have fulfilled their meet and confer requirements.

V.       ANALYSIS  
The
Court will address Formosa’s causes of action in the order they are addressed in
H & H’s Demurrer. Accordingly, the Court will address Formosa’s third cause
of action, then fourth cause of action, and, finally, its second cause of
action. 
A.            
Formosa Now Pleads Its Fraud Claim With
Specificity.
“The
elements of fraud, which give rise to the tort action for deceit, are (1) a
misrepresentation, (2) with knowledge of its falsity, (3) with the intent to induce
another’s reliance on the misrepresentation, (4) justifiable reliance, and (5)
resulting damage.” (Conroy v. Regents of Univ. of Cal. (2009) 45 Cal.4th
1244, 1255.) “The elements for a fraudulent concealment claim are: (1) the
defendant must have concealed or suppressed a material fact, (2) the defendant
must have been under a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3) the
defendant must have intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the
intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have been unaware of
the fact and would not have acted as he did if he had known of the concealed or
suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of the concealment or suppression of the
fact, the plaintiff must have sustained damage.” (Nissan Motor Acceptance
Cases (2021) 63 Cal.App.5th 793, 826 (internal quotations omitted).) “No
liability for concealment exists unless there is a duty to disclose.” (Id.)

“Relevant
to the element of duty for fraud and deceit claims, in transactions which do
not involve fiduciary or confidential relations, a cause of action for
non-disclosure of material facts may arise in at least three instances: (1) the
defendant makes representations but does not disclose facts which materially
qualify the facts disclosed, or which render his disclosure likely to mislead;
(2) the facts are known or accessible only to defendant, and defendant knows
they are not known to or reasonably discoverable by the plaintiff; (3) the defendant
actively conceals discovery from the plaintiff.” (Id. (internal
quotations and brackets omitted).)
“[F]raud
must be specifically pleaded. This means: (1) general pleading of the legal
conclusion of fraud is insufficient; and (2) every element of the cause of
action for fraud must be alleged in full, factually and specifically, and the
policy of liberal construction of pleading will not usually be invoked to
sustain a pleading that is defective in any material respect.” (Wilhelm v.
Pray, Price, Williams & Russell (1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 1324, 1331.) In
addition, a cause of action of fraud against a corporation requires a plaintiff
to allege the names of persons who made the allegedly fraudulent
representations, their authority to speak, to whom they spoke, what they said
or wrote, and when. (See Tarmann v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.
(1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153, 157-58.)
However,
this rule of particularity must be applied differently in the case of
non-disclosure because it is difficult to allege “who” or “how” or “by what
means” something was not disclosed or “when” or “where” a statement was not
made. (See Alfaro v. Community Housing Improvement System & Planning
Assn., Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1356, 1384.) Less particularity is
required in these cases because the facts supporting concealment are more
likely to be known by a defendant. (See id.)
Now, H & H argues Formosa’s FACC’s fraud cause of action is
still lacking. Formosa’s FACC “lack[s] any allegation
demonstrating actual misrepresentation made by H & H other than contractual
terms of the contract entered between” the parties. (See Demurrer, p. 8:
8-9) Further, H & H argues Formosa failed to amend the allegations of
intent to defraud. (See id., at 14-15)
In
opposition, Formosa argues it adequately plead fraud in its FACC because they
amended the Cross-Complaint to specify who made the representations, what the
representations were, and how the representations were made based on this
Court’s order. (See Opposition, p. 6: 9-11.) Formosa concludes that the
FACC provides enough specificity for a valid fraud cause of action. (See id.,
at 25-26)
The
Court agrees with Formosa that its additions have cured the defect that led the
Court to sustain H & H’s first demurrer. Formosa amended the
Cross-Complaint to specify who made the representations (Jonathan Bymel), what
they were (performance of “all (Fire Damage) permanent repairs”), and how they
were made (“in writing via the written Agreement entered into or on October 6,
2021). (FACC, ¶ 43.) Formosa also added allegations about further
misrepresentation by Mr. Bymel to Mr. Kin of Formosa regarding costs and scope
of work that same October 6, 2021, agreement. (See id., ¶44.) Those new
allegations along with allegations that H & H’s “promises [through Mr.
Bymel] were false and that [H & H] intentionally misled [Formosa] to
believe the scope of work would be completed in a timely fashion and within an
approved budget” now raise Formosa’s fraud action above the bar separating it from
a garden variety breach of contract claim.
(Id. at ¶ 45.)
Accordingly, the Court OVERRULES H & H’s Demurrer as to
Formosa’s third cause of action for fraud.
B.            
Formosa’s Negligence Claim May Proceed.
“The elements of any negligence cause of action are
duty, breach of duty, proximate cause, and damages.” (Peredia v. HR Mobile
Services, Inc. (2018) 25 Cal.App.5th 680, 687.) “Everyone is responsible,
not only for the result of his or her willful acts, but also for an injury
occasioned to another by his or her want of ordinary care or skill in the
management of his or her property or person, except so far as the latter has,
willfully or by want of ordinary care, brought the injury upon himself or
herself.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1714(a).)
The parties essentially repeat the arguments they
made in connection with H & H’s first demurrer. H & H alleges Formosa cannot
assert a negligence cause of action against H & H as the dispute is purely
contractual in nature. Therefore, H & H contends, the economic loss rule
bars any recovery in negligence as purely economic losses are not recoverable
in tort. Furthermore, H & H contends, because Formosa’s fraud cause of
action fails, there is no exception to the economic loss rule to save Formosa’s
negligence cause of action. 
Formosa opposes by citing to Robinson Helicopter
Co., Inc. v. Dana Corp., (2004) 34 Cal.4th 979, where the California
Supreme Court held tort claims like negligence are appropriate in contract disputes
where the contract was fraudulently induced. Because it has specifically
alleged fraud, Formosa argues it can maintain a cause of action for negligence
under this exception. 
The
California Supreme Court in Robinson limited its holding permitting
fraud claims to proceed in contract actions to “a defendant’s affirmative
misrepresentations on which Plaintiffs rely, and which expose Plaintiffs to
liability for personal damages independent of the Plaintiffs’ economic loss.” (Robinson
Helicopter Co., Inc. v. Dana Corp. (2004) 34 Cal.4th 979, 993.) Since the Court concluded Formosa’s FACC has corrected
the defect in its fraud cause of action, Formosa’s fourth cause of
action for negligence arising out of that fraud now fits within Robinson’s
narrow exception to the economic loss rule. (See Robinson, 34
Cal.4th at pg. 993.) 
Accordingly, the Court OVERRULES H & H’s Demurrer as to
Formosa’s fourth cause of action for negligence.
C.            
Formosa’s Section 17200 Claim Survives.
Unfair
competition is defined as “any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business
act or practice.” (Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200.) “Practice”
generally means the habitual doing of certain things, the doing of an act more
than once . . . or repeated or customary action. (Wilson v. Stearns (1954)
123 Cal.App.2d 472, 479.) 
By
proscribing “any unlawful” business act or practice, the unfair competition law
(“UCL”) “borrows” rules set out in other laws and makes violations of those
rules independently actionable. (See Zhang v. Superior Court (2013)
57 Cal.4th 364, 370.) A “violation of another law is a predicate for
stating a cause of action under the UCL’s unlawful prong.” (Berryman v.
Merit Property Management, Inc. (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 1544, 1554.)  
H & H argues that Formosa’s FACC made no amendments to
this cause of action and its demurrer should be sustained for the same reason
the Court sustained its first demurrer as to this cause of action. (See Demurrer,
p. 11: 7-8.) More specifically, that a violation of Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200
requires a showing of an unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent business act and that
since Formosa failed to sufficiently allege fraud, H & H argues Formosa has
thus failed to allege any violations of Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200.
Formosa opposes by alleging the FACC specifically alleges a
fraud cause of action by including who made the representations, what those
were, and how they were made.
Since
the Court found Formosa pleaded its cause of action for fraud with the
requisite specificity, the Court finds Formosa also properly pleaded its second
cause of action for violation of Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200.
Accordingly, the Court OVERRULES H & H’s Demurrer as to
Formosa’s second cause of action for violation of Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200.

VI.    
CONCLUSION
         
Based on the foregoing analysis, the Court OVERRULES H & H’s Demurrer
as to Formosa’s third, fourth, and second causes of action. 
          The
Court orders H & H to file an Answer only on or before October 18, 2024.
          IT
IS SO ORDERED.
