And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has ruled on H & H Builders and Restoration, Inc.'s demurrer to Formosa Plaza, LLC's First Amended Cross-Complaint. After reviewing the pleadings and engaging in a meet and confer process, the court has found that Formosa's amended Cross-Complaint has cured the defects that led to the previous demurrer being sustained. Specifically, the court has found that Formosa's fraud cause of action is now properly pleaded with specificity, including allegations of who made the misrepresentations, what they were, and how they were made. The court has also found that Formosa's negligence cause of action is permitted under the exception to the economic loss rule, as it is based on fraudulently induced contract. Finally, the court has sustained Formosa's violation of Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200 cause of action, finding that the amended Cross-Complaint properly alleges a violation of this statute. As a result, the court has overruled H & H's demurrer and ordered H & H to file an answer to the Cross-Complaint by October 18, 2024.
