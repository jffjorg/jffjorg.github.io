Hearing date: 5/1/24
Attorney Block’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for
Afakori, Inc.
 
Counsel Block seeks to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff
Afakori, Inc., citing a breakdown of the attorney client relationship. Block Decl.,
para. 2. The motion is on the correct forms and was served on Amir Alizadeh of
Afakori, Inc. There is no opposition.
The motion is GRANTED. The court sets an OSC re failure to
obtain new counsel, as a corporation must be represented by counsel. Trial is
set for 8/26/24. The court notes a second amended cross-complaint was recently
filed, which might require a continuance of the trial, as the matter is not at
issue.
