And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike in the case of Hill v. Sundquist. The court has sustained Sundquist's demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that Hill's complaint will be dismissed. The court has also granted Sundquist's motion to strike the phrase "intentional and malicious" from the complaint. The court found that Sundquist's conduct, including failing to contribute to the replacement of a shared fence and removing a vine from the fence, was not "extreme and outrageous" and did not rise to the level of malice. The court also found that Hill did not allege sufficient facts to establish that Sundquist owed a duty to avoid negligently causing emotional distress.
