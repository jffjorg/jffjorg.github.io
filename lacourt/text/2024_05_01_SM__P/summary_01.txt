The tentative ruling is about Attorney Block's motion to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff Afakori, Inc. The motion was granted, and the court sets an order to show cause (OSC) re failure to obtain new counsel, as a corporation must be represented by counsel. The trial is set for August 26, 2024. The court notes that a second amended cross-complaint was recently filed, which might require a continuance of the trial, as the matter is not at issue.
