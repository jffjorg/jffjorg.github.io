was late, as they could access it until January 2, 2024. Specifically, they
urge that they could not access the Dropbox files. (Reply, p. 3: 23-25.) However,
Plaintiffs have not shown how their access problems are attributable to
Defendants.  In addition, Plaintiffs did
manage to consider the opposition and write a reply (and the hearing was also
continued due to the Court’s workload). 
This, the Court considers the merits of Defendants’ opposition.
