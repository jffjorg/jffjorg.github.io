And here is a brief English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion for summary judgment and alternative summary adjudication filed by Direct Capital Corporation and Cit Bank, N.A. (Plaintiffs). The case involves a loan agreement between Plaintiffs and Cinemills Corporation, which was defaulted by the defendant. Plaintiffs repossessed the equipment and sold it for $1,000, but claim they are still owed $105,865.13. The judge has found that there are triable issues of material fact regarding the breach of contract, open book account, and loss of collateral. The judge also found that the affirmative defenses raised by the defendants are valid and have not been waived. The case will proceed to trial.
