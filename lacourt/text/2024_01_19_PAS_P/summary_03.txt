And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the motion to compel General Motors LLC (GM) to produce its person most qualified for deposition. The motion was filed by Plaintiffs Herman and Rosa Lopez, who claim that their 2019 Chevrolet Blazer is a lemon and that GM failed to repurchase the vehicle after a reasonable number of repair attempts. The Court finds that the Plaintiffs failed to meet and confer in good faith and that the deposition notice seeks trade secret information, which is protected from disclosure. The Court also declines to award monetary sanctions to the Plaintiffs, as they failed to meet and confer in good faith prior to making this motion. The motion to compel deposition is denied, and the case will proceed to the scheduled hearing date.
