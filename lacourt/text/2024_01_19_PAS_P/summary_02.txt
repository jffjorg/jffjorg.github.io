And here is the English-text summary:

The court has reviewed the evidence and considered the opposition submitted by the defendants. The plaintiffs argued that the defendants' opposition was late because they could not access the Dropbox files until January 2, 2024. However, the court finds that the plaintiffs have not shown how their access problems are attributable to the defendants. Despite this, the plaintiffs were able to consider the opposition and write a reply. The court has taken these factors into consideration and will continue the hearing due to its own workload.
