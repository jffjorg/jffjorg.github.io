Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's motion to amend judgment. The motion was filed by the Plaintiff, Diana Culkin, in response to the court's previous ruling granting summary judgment to the Defendants, INCO Builders, Sam Ostayan, and Fleet Capital Inc.

The Judge's ruling is based on several reasons. First, the Plaintiff failed to file a separate statement in opposition to the Defendants' motion, which was required by the court's rules. Second, the Plaintiff failed to provide competent evidence to support its claims that the foreclosure was void and improper. Third, the Plaintiff failed to point to any new facts or law that would change the court's previous ruling.

The Judge also rejects the Plaintiff's arguments that the foreclosure was "void" and "improper" under California's nonjudicial foreclosure statutes and various federal statutes. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff failed to plead these claims in its operative complaint and that the evidence presented by the Defendants established that they complied with the relevant statutes.

Finally, the Judge notes that the Plaintiff failed to provide any authority that required the Defendants to avoid foreclosing on interest in favor of seeking a foreclosure on the balloon payment, and that the Plaintiff's claims of "fraud" and "unjust enrichment" are vague and unsupported by evidence.

Overall, the Judge's ruling is a denial of the Plaintiff's motion to amend judgment, and the case will proceed as previously ruled.
