The judge has granted U.S. Bank's application for default judgment against Seahawk Transit Inc. and Shuli Guo. The default judgment is in the amount of $143,633.00, including $129,300.10 in damages, $10,584.90 in interest, $3,183.00 in attorney fees, and $565.00 in costs. The court found that U.S. Bank has submitted sufficient evidence to support the default judgment. The judge notes that the CIV-100 form filed by U.S. Bank contains an incorrect total judgment amount, but the proposed judgment lists the correct total. The court orders U.S. Bank's counsel to file an amended CIV-100 form with the correct total judgment amount.
