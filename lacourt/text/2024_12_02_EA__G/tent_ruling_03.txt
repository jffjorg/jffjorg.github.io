for Default Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff U.S. Bank National Association’s Application
for Default Judgment is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
This
is a breach of contract action arising from an equipment finance agreement. In October
2022, Plaintiff U.S. Bank National Association (U.S. Bank) entered into a
written equipment finance agreement with Defendant Seahawk Transit Inc. (Seahawk
Transit) in which U.S. Bank agreed to provide financing for Seahawk Transit’s
purchase of two Kenworth trucks. In support of the agreement, Defendant Shuli
Guo executed a personal guaranty. Starting in January 2024, U.S. Bank alleges Seahawk
Transit and Guo breached the agreement by failing to make the required monthly
payments.
On July
18, 2024, U.S. Bank filed a complaint against Seahawk Transit, Guo, and Does
1-100, alleging the following causes of action: (1) breach of written
agreement, (2) breach of personal guaranty, (3) unjust enrichment, (4)
indebtedness, (5) account stated, (6) claim and delivery, and (7) conversion. On August 5, 2024, U.S. Bank’s
process server served Seahawk Transit and Guo with substitute service in
Baldwin Park.
On September
17, 2024, the court entered default against Seahawk Transit and Guo after they
failed to timely file an answer. On September 20, 2024, U.S. Bank submitted the
present application for default judgment.
A case
management conference is set for December 2, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
U.S.
Bank seeks default judgment against Seahawk Transit and Guo in the total amount
of $143,633.00, including $129,300.10 in damages, $10,584.90 in interest, $3,183.00
in attorney fees, and $565.00 in costs. Because the court finds U.S. Bank has
submitted sufficient evidence, the court GRANTS U.S. Bank’s application
for default judgment.
The court notes that the CIV-100
form file by Plaintiff erroneously lists the total requested judgment as
$146,633.00 when it should be $143,633.00. However, the proposed judgment lists
the correct total.  Plaintiff’s counsel
is ordered to file forthwith an amended CIV-100 form which list the correct judgment
total as $143,633.00.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, U.S. Bank’s application for default
judgment is GRANTED.
