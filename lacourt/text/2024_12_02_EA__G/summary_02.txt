And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled to continue the hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike until a date to be determined. The Judge has also ordered the Plaintiff's counsel to meet and confer with the Defendant's counsel regarding the demurrer and motion to strike and to file a supplemental declaration describing such meet and confer efforts, including whether the attempts were made by telephone, video conference, or in person, at least nine court days before the next scheduled hearing.

The Judge's decision is based on the fact that the parties did not adequately meet and confer, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's counsel failed to make sufficient efforts to meet and confer with the Defendant's counsel, and therefore, a continuance of the hearing is appropriate.

The Judge notes that while Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41 does not provide that failing to meet and confer is grounds to overrule a demurrer, courts have discretion to order counsel to meaningfully discuss the pleadings with an eye toward reducing the number of issues or eliminating the need for a demurrer, and to continue the hearing date to facilitate that effort.
