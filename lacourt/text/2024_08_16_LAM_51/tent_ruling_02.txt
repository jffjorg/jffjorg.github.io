The lease indicates July 15, 2013.

Even though counsel submitting the meet and confer declaration has since been
relieved, the court nevertheless cautions counsel against misrepresenting facts
to the court.

The court notes that, despite requesting further briefing, neither party
meaningfully analyzed discussing the applicability of the Statute of Frauds to
the Pre-Lease Representations. Rather, the parties provide general authorities
and cursory argument which was not particularly helpful.

Cross-Complainants could hypothetically exercise the lease renewal term within
the first year but that has problems, too, since that term does pertain to a real property lease over one year (as it is for a
five-year lease extension). However, Cross-Complainants do not allege breach of
this particular alleged representation.

Alternatively, the Pre-Lease Representations fall under the statute because
they modify a contract that falls under the statute – namely, the Lease. (Reeder v. Specialized Loan Servicing LLC
(2020) 52 Cal.App.5th 795, 801-802.) Here, as in Reeder, the alleged oral representations occurred before entering
the subject Lease. (FACC ¶ 8.) As alleged, these representations significantly
modify the Lease. (Ibid.) As such,
they must be written to be enforceable.
