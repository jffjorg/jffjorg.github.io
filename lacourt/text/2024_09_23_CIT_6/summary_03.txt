And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Futong Container Transportation Co. Ltd. (Futong) to the complaint filed by Wanbin Yan (Plaintiff). The judge sustains the demurrer to the First Cause of Action (hostile work environment and harassment) and Second Cause of Action (wrongful constructive termination) with 20 days' leave to amend. The judge sustains the demurrer to the Third Cause of Action (willful misclassification of employees as independent contractors) without leave to amend. The judge orders Futong to give notice of the ruling within five calendar days. The judge's ruling is based on the facts pleaded in the complaint and the legal standards applicable to demurrers. The judge finds that the complaint fails to state a cause of action for hostile work environment and harassment because it fails to allege that the plaintiff is a member of a protected class and that he was harassed because of that membership. The judge also finds that the complaint fails to state a cause of action for wrongful constructive termination because it fails to allege sufficient facts to demonstrate an objectively intolerable working condition. Finally, the judge finds that the complaint fails to state a cause of action for willful misclassification of employees as independent contractors because Labor Code section 226.8 does not provide a private right of action.
