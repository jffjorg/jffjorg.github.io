And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Del Terra's motion to compel compliance with its subpoena for business records from Los Angeles County Office of Education (LACOE). The court finds that LACOE failed to provide complete and timely responses to the subpoena, and that LACOE waived its objections to the production of the records. The court orders LACOE to serve complete and verified responses without objections to the subpoena categories listed in the order within 20 days of the issuance of the order. The court declines to impose sanctions on LACOE, finding that such sanctions would be unjust given the legitimate dispute over whether LACOE had waived its objections.
