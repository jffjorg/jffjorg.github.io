  Case Number:  21PSCV00399    Hearing Date:   November 16, 2023    Dept:  G Defendant Del Terra Real Estate Services, Inc.’s  Motion to Compel Compliance, or in the Alternative, Further Responses to  Subpoena and a Privilege Log Respondent: Non-Party Los  Angeles County Office of Education TENTATIVE RULING Defendant Del Terra Real Estate Services, Inc.’s  Motion to Compel Compliance is GRANTED and Non-Party Los Angeles County Office  of Education is ordered to serve complete verified responses without objections  to subpoena categories 2-20, 22-29, 32, 33, 35-38, 41, and 42 on Defendant Del  Terra Real Estate Services, Inc. within twenty (20) days of the issuance of  this order. BACKGROUND This is a breach of contract  action arising from an agreement to provide construction management services.  In April 2015, Plaintiff Bassett Unified School District (BUSD) entered into a  written agreement with Defendant Del Terra Real Estate Services, Inc. (Del  Terra) in which Del Terra agreed to provide construction management services for  BUSD’s new and existing construction projects. In 2018 and 2019, the agreement  between BUSD and Del Terra was extended. Subsequently, BUSD alleges Del Terra  breached the agreement by overbilling BUSD and failing to maintain proper  records. On May 17, 2021, BUSD filed a  complaint against Del Terra and Does 1-100, alleging the following causes of  action: (1) breach of contract, (2) breach of fiduciary duty, (3) negligence,  (4) intentional misrepresentation, (5) constructive fraud, and (6) negligent  misrepresentation. On September 17, 2021, BUSD  filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) against the same defendants alleging the  same causes of action. On January 4, 2022, the court sustained a demurrer by  Del Terra to BUSD’s fourth and fifth causes of action without leave to amend. On February 3, 2022, Del  Terra filed a cross-complaint against BUSD and Roes 1-100, alleging the  following causes of action: (1) breach of contract, (2) breach of the covenant  of good faith and fair dealing, (3) declaratory relief. On October 20, 2023, Del  Terra filed the present motion. A hearing on the motion is set for November 16  with a final status conference on July 10, 2024 and a jury trial on July 23,  2024. ANALYSIS Del  Terra moves to compel non-party Los Angeles County Office of Education (LACOE)’s  compliance with a subpoena for business records. For the following reasons, the  court GRANTS Del Terra’s motion. Legal Standard A  party seeking discovery from a person who is not a party to the action may  obtain discovery by oral deposition, written deposition, or deposition subpoena  for production of business records. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2020.010.) A  deposition subpoena may command: (1) only the attendance and testimony of the  deponent, (2) only the production of business records for copying, or (3) the  attendance and testimony of the deponent, as well as the production of business  records, other documents, electronically stored information, and tangible  things. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2020.020.) Service  of a deposition subpoena shall be done with sufficient time in  advance of the deposition to provide the deponent a reasonable opportunity to  locate and produce any designated documents and, where personal attendance is  commanded, a reasonable time to travel to the place of deposition. (Code Civ.  Proc., § 2020.220, subd. (a).) Personal service of any deposition subpoena is  effective to require a deponent who is a resident of California to: personally  appear and testify, if the subpoena so specifies; to produce any specified  documents; and to appear at a court session if the subpoena so specifies. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2020.220, subd. (c).) A deponent who disobeys a deposition  subpoena may be punished for contempt without the necessity of a prior order of  the court directing compliance by the witness. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2020.240.) A  “written notice and all moving papers supporting a motion to compel an answer  to a deposition question or to compel production of a document or tangible  thing from a nonparty deponent must be personally served on the nonparty  deponent unless the nonparty deponent agrees to accept service by mail or  electronic service at an address or electronic service address specified on the  deposition record.” (Cal. Rules of Court 3.1346.) A  nonparty deponent may be subject to contempt or monetary sanctions for  disobeying a court order (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subd. (k)) or for  “flouting” the discovery process by suppressing or destroying evidence (Temple  Community Hospital v. Superior Court (1999) 20 Cal.4th 464, 476).  A  nonparty may be punished by contempt (Code Civ. Proc., § 2020.240) or payment  of $500.00 (Code Civ. Proc., § 1992). Discussion On March  31, 2023, Del Terra served a deposition subpoena for the production of business  records on LACOE with a due date of April 25, 2023. (Nguyen Decl., ¶ 6; Saldana  Decl., ¶ 2.) Two days after responses were due on April 27, 2023, a legal  secretary for LACOE’s Office of General Counsel requested the due date be  extended to May 23, 2023. (Nguyen Decl., ¶ 7, Ex. D; Saldana Decl., ¶ 3.) Del  Terra’s counsel responded by stating counsel could grant the extension unless  LACOE planned on making objections. (Nguyen Decl., ¶ 7, Ex. E; Saldana Decl., ¶  3.) On May 23, 2023, Del Terra’s counsel granted LACOE an additional one-day  extension to respond. (Nguyen Decl., ¶ 8.) On  May 24, 2023, LACOE responded with 254 pages of discovery and did not include  any objections. (Nguyen Decl., ¶ 9; Saldana Decl., ¶ 4.) After counsel for the  parties met and conferred over the sufficiency of LACOE’s responses, LACOE  agreed to provide additional responses within two (2) weeks of June 20, 2023.  (Nguyen Decl., ¶ 9-10; Saldana Decl., ¶ 5.) On July 5, 2023, LACOE provided  additional discovery responses, but included written objections which were not  previously asserted. (Nguyen Decl., ¶ 11; Saldana Decl., ¶ 6.) Del  Terra argues LACOE’s responses to categories 2-20, 22-29, 32, 33, 35-38, 41,  and 42 are deficient. While LACOE provided discovery for categories 11, 17, 26,  28, 35, and 38, Del Terra argues their responses are likely incomplete. Del  Terra also argues LACOE failed to provide any discovery for the other  categories. As  an initial matter, the court addresses Del Terra’s argument that LACOE has  waived objections. Del Terra argues a nonparty responding to a deposition subpoena  for records must preserve objections by raising them by the date for document  production and cites to Unzipped Apparel, LLC v. Bader (2007) 156  Cal.App.4th 123 (Unzipped Apparel). But Unzipped Apparel did not  deal with the timeliness of objections and instead addressed the issue of when  a motion to compel answers to a deposition subpoena must be brought. (Id.,  at p. 127.) Pursuant  to Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.460, subdivision (a), “[t]he protection  of information from discovery on the ground that it is privileged or that it is  a protected work product . . . is waived unless a specific objection to its  disclosure is timely made during the deposition.” “[D]iscovery conducted by way  of a business records subpoena is a ‘deposition.’” (Id., at p. 131.) In Unzipped  Apparel, the court noted “[n]ot  all document productions are completed on the date stated in the subpoena” and  “[u]ntil the entire inspection is finished, including the raising of any  objections during that process, the necessity and scope of a motion to compel  may not be known.” (Id., at p. 134.) At first glance, Unzipped  Apparel appears to suggest that this type of deposition process can extend  beyond the production deadline in the subpoena and that objections can be made  throughout that process. But this language appears in a discussion of when a “subpoenaing  party opts to inspect and copy the original documents at the office of the  responding business.” (Id., at p. 134.) The same time and place  constraints that exist in that case are not present when the responding  business is the one required to produce documents by the date in the subpoena. Furthermore,  it is not enough to submit objections during the deposition process, since the code  requires them to be “timely made.” The court notes two grounds  upon which it relies in finding that LACOE failed to make timely objections.  First, LACOE did not provide responses or objections by the April 25, 2023,  deadline in the business records subpoena. Second, when LACOE did provide  deposition responses after two extensions of time to reply on May 24, 2023, LACOE  again did not include any objections. Instead, LACOE waited to provide its  objections in its second set of responses on July 5, 2023. The court does not  find as timely submitted objections that were served seventy-one (71) days  after the date due.  Accordingly, the  court finds LACOE waived any objections on the grounds of privilege or attorney  work product. Additionally, the court finds  that LACOE failed to comply in full with the deposition subpoena for business  records since LACOE’s discovery responses only included nonprivileged communications  or documents. Accordingly, Del Terra’s motion is GRANTED. To the extent Del Terra  requests the imposition of sanctions, the court declines to do so as the court  finds such sanctions would be unjust given there was a legitimate dispute over  whether LACOE had waived its objections. CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, Del  Terra’s motion to compel compliance is GRANTED and LACOE is ordered to serve  complete verified responses without objections to subpoena categories 2-20, 22-29, 32, 33, 35-38, 41, and 42 on  Del Terra within twenty (20) days of the issuance of this order.
