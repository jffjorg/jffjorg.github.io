And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge sustains State Farm's demurrer as to the third and fourth causes of action (unfair competition and financial elder abuse) with leave to amend. The judge finds that Plaintiffs have not stated sufficient facts to support these claims. The judge grants State Farm's motion to strike paragraphs of the complaint that allege punitive damages, finding that the allegations do not demonstrate malice, fraud, or oppression.

The judge also denies in part and grants in part State Farm's motion to strike, finding that some paragraphs of the complaint are not relevant or improper.

Plaintiffs have leave to file their amended complaint by November 1, 2024.
