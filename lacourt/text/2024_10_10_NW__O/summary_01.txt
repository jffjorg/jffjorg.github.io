Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied Plaintiff Ami Ban Hayun's Motion for Sanctions against Defendant General Motors LLC. The Plaintiff had sought additional sanctions for Defendant's failure to pay discovery sanctions, which were previously ordered by the Court. The Court found that Defendant's counsel was substantially justified in their payment delay due to office staffing issues. The Court also noted that Plaintiff's counsel had already filed a Motion to Compel and had received a settlement agreement with Defendant, and therefore, the additional sanctions sought were not justified.
