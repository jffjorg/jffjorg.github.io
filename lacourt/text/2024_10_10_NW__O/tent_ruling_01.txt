     CASE NO.: 23VECV01146
 
ORDER
  DENYING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR SANCTIONS



 


 
I.              
BACKGROUND 
This case arises
out of Plaintiff Ami Ban Hayun’s purchase of an allegedly defective 2021 Chevrolet
Silverado. On March 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against Defendant
General Motors LLC (“Defendant”), alleging (1) Breach of Implied Warranty, (2)
Breach Express Warranty, (3) Violation of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty
Act. 
On May 31,
2024, this Court granted Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel the Deposition of
Defendant’s Person Most Qualified and ordered Defendant’s counsel to pay
Plaintiff’s counsel $1,860.00 in discovery sanctions on or before June 30,
2024.
 Plaintiff now seeks sanctions for Defendant’s failure to timely
pay the Court-ordered sanctions.
II.           
PROCEDURAL
HISTORY
On March 15,
2023, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against Defendant, alleging (1) Breach of
Implied Warranty, (2) Breach Express Warranty, (3) Violation of the Song-Beverly
Consumer Warranty Act. 
On April 17,
2023, Defendant filed its Answer. 
On May 31,
2024, this Court granted Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel. 
On June 25,
2024, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Settlement. 
On July 25,
2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for Sanctions (“Motion”). 
On August 14,
2024, Defendant filed its Opposition. 
On October 1,
2024, Plaintiff filed his Reply. 
III.        
LEGAL STANDARD
On motion, if
a party “fails to obey an order compelling attendance, testimony, and
production, the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction” as provided in Section 2030.010, et seq. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.450(h).)[1] The
“court, after notice to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after an
opportunity for hearing, may impose” monetary, issue, evidence, or terminating
sanctions “against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery
process[.]” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030(a)-(d).) Failing to respond or
submit to an authorized method of discovery and disobeying a court order to
provide discovery are misuses of the discovery process. (See Code
Civ. Proc. § 2023.010(d), (g).)
IV.         
ANALYSIS
Plaintiff’s
counsel declares, as of the date he filed his Motion (July 25, 2024), Defendant
has not paid its Court-ordered discovery sanctions. (See Declaration of
Lior Sadgan filed July 25, 2024 (“Sadgan Decl.”), ¶ 6.) Plaintiff’s counsel
further declares Defendant has not produced its Person Most Qualified for deposition,
nor has it sent a draft of the parties’ settlement agreement, despite
Plaintiff’s attempts to informally resolve the issues via email. (See Sadgan
Decl., ¶¶ 4-5, 7.) All of this, Plaintiff argues, entitles Plaintiff to $1,485.00
in additional discovery sanctions, which accounts for 1.5 hours to draft
the Motion and 1.5 hours to reply to Defendant’s Opposition and appear at the
hearing. (See id. at 8-9.)
In
opposition, Defendant’s counsel declares they notified Plaintiff’s counsel their
office was short-staffed and, on July 11, 2024, that the sanctions check had
been requested and that they would send it as soon as it arrived; the check was
sent on July 24, 2024, one day before Plaintiff filed the instant Motion. (See
Declaration of Jesse Valencia filed August 14, 2024, ¶¶ 4-5, Exs. A-B.)
          Plaintiff’s
Motion is DENIED. While the Court expects its orders to be followed, the Court
finds Defendant’s counsel was substantially justified in their payment delay. Given
the extraordinarily high volume of cases counsel for both sides currently face,
the Court would like to think that at some point, Plaintiff’s counsel would
have the professional judgment reflective of the hourly rates they routinely ask
courts to award and realize that not every violation of a court’s orders
requires the expenditure of additional scarce resources by all involved,
especially the judiciary’s, particularly regarding a case that had already
settled a month before counsel brought this motion.
V.            
CONCLUSION
Based on the
foregoing, the Court DENIES Plaintiff’s Motion for Sanctions.
          IT
IS SO ORDERED.
DATED:      October 10, 2024.

Judge,
