I.        INTRODUCTION
Plaintiffs
Douglas Nord and Frances Nord (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) allege a tree fell
on their home on February 28, 2021. (See Complaint, ¶ 8.) Plaintiffs
further allege they had an insurance policy with Defendant State Farm General
Insurance Company (“State Farm”) at the time of the incident, but State Farm failed
to pay their full benefits due to them under their policy. (See id. at 9-15.)
Plaintiffs also allege one of State Farm’s adjustors, Defendant Romel Carlos
Santiago, negligently mispresented the status of Plaintiffs’ entitlement to benefits
under the policy. (See id. at 49-53.) 
State Farm
now demurrers to Plaintiffs’ third and fourth causes of action for unfair
competition and financial elder abuse, respectively, and moves to strike portions
of Plaintiffs’ Complaint.  
II.      PROCEDURAL
HISTORY
On July 3,
2024, Plaintiffs filed their Complaint, alleging (1) Breach of Contract; (2)
Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; (3) Violation of
Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17200, et seq.; (4) Financial Elder Abuse (Welf. &
Inst. Code, § 15610.30); and (5) Negligent Misrepresentation. 
On September
17, 2024, State Farm filed the instant Demurrer and Motion to Strike. 
On September
30, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their Opposition. 
On October 3,
2024, State Farm filed its Reply. 
III.     LEGAL
STANDARD
A.       Demurrer
A demurrer is a pleading used to test
the legal sufficiency of other pleadings. It raises issues of law, not
fact, regarding the form or content of the opposing party’s pleading
(complaint, answer or cross-complaint). (See Code Civ. Proc. §§
422.10, 589; see Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116
Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)[1] It
is not the function of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the
complaint; and for purposes of the ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in
the complaint are assumed to be true. (See Donabedian, 116 Cal.App.4th
at 994.) 
“We treat the demurrer as admitting all
material facts properly pleaded but not contentions, deductions or conclusions
of fact or law. We accept the factual allegations of the complaint as true and
also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.” (Mitchell v.
California Department of Public Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007
(citation omitted); see also Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co.
(1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604 [“the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed
to be true, however improbable they may be”].) Allegations are to be liberally
construed. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 452.) A demurrer may be brought if
insufficient facts are stated to support the cause of action asserted. (See
Code Civ. Proc. § 430.10(e).)  
A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a
complaint as a matter of law.” (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010)
183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.) “[T]he court gives the complaint a reasonable interpretation,
and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly
pleaded.” (Id.) In testing the sufficiency of the complaint, the
court must assume the truth of (1) the properly pleaded factual allegations;
(2) facts that can be reasonably inferred from those expressly pleaded; and (3)
judicially noticed matters. (See Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d
311, 318.) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters. (See SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d
902, 905.) No other extrinsic evidence can be considered. (See Ion
Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 881 [error for court to
consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting demurrer]; see also Afuso
v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862
[disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos.
(1988) 46 Cal.3d 287] [error to consider contents of release not part of court
record].) Accordingly, “[w]hether the plaintiff will be able to prove the
pleaded facts is irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer.” (Stevens v.
Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 605, 609-10.) 
A demurrer can only be sustained when
it disposes of an entire cause of action. (See Poizner v. Fremont
General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of Hawaiian
Gardens Redev. Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.) Leave to
amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. (See Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The
burden is on the complainant to show the Court a pleading can be amended
successfully. (Id.) However, “[i]f there is any reasonable possibility
that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to sustain a
demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).  
B.      Motion
to Strike
The court may, upon a motion, or at any time in
its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false,
or improper matter inserted in any pleading. (See Code Civ. Proc. §
436(a).) The court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or
filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of
the court. (See id. at § 436(b).) The grounds for a motion to strike are
that the pleading has irrelevant, false or improper matter, or has not been
drawn or filed in conformity with laws. (See id. at § 436.) The grounds
for moving to strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of
judicial notice. (See id. at § 437.)
IV.     MEET AND CONFER
Before
filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party shall meet
and confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference with the party
who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of
determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a),
emphasis added.) A declaration must be filed with a demurrer regarding the
results of the meet and confer process. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a)(3).)
          State
Farm’s counsel declares she had a telephonic call with Plaintiffs’ counsel but
that the parties were unable to reach an agreement. (See Declaration of
Ellin Lee filed September 17, 2024, ¶ 4.) Accordingly, the Court finds State
Farm has satisfied its meet and confer requirements.
V.       ANALYSIS   
A.            
Plaintiffs Fail to State Sufficient Facts to
State a Cause of Action for Violation of Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17200, et
seq. 
Unfair
competition is defined as “any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business
act or practice.” (Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200.) By proscribing “any
unlawful” business act or practice, the unfair competition law (“UCL”)
“borrows” rules set out in other laws and makes violations of those rules
independently actionable. (See Zhang v. Superior Court (2013) 57
Cal.4th 364, 370.) A “violation of another law is a predicate for stating
a cause of action under the UCL’s unlawful prong.” (Berryman v. Merit
Property Management, Inc. (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 1544, 1554.) “[A]n
‘unfair’ business practice occurs when that practice ‘offends an established
public policy or when the practice is immoral, unethical, oppressive,
unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers.” (Davis v. Ford Motor
Credit Co., LLC (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 581, 585.) “Unfair” practices must
also be tethered to some underlying constitutional, statutory, or regulatory
provision. (See Scripps Clinic v. Superior Court (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th
917, 940.)  
State
Farm argues Plaintiffs fail to state an unfair competition law (“UCL”) cause of
action because (1) they have an adequate remedy at law in their breach of
contract claim; (2) their injunction request is therefore improper; and (3) they
have not sufficiently pled the business act or practice was unlawful, unfair,
or fraudulent. (See Demurrer, pp. 5-10.) Specifically, State Farm argues
Plaintiffs UCL claim is based on State Farm’s alleged violations of “California’s
Unfair Insurance Practices Act (“UIPA[sic]) under Ins. Code § 790.03(h) and the
related Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Regulations under 10 C.C.R. § 2695.1
et seq.” (Id. at 8.) State Farm further argues there is no private right
of action for violation of UIPA and that Plaintiffs may not plead around this
prohibition “by characterizing a cause of action based upon UIPA violations as
a separate UCL claim.” (Id. (citing Moradi-Shalal v. Fireman’s Fund
Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d 287, 304).) 
In
opposition, Plaintiffs argue “State Farm may be held liable for violations of
Business and Professions Code § 17200 based on its ‘bad faith’ in handling
Plaintiffs’ claim,” that such bad faith allegations allege State Farm’s “unlawful”
conduct, and that “Plaintiffs do not seek to ‘borrow’ from the [UIPA] regulations;
rather, violations of the regulations are evidence of State Farm’s bad faith
which is the basis for Plaintiffs’ UCL claim.” (Opposition, pg. 4.) Plaintiffs also
argue they can seek injunctive relief as part of their UCL claim because they still
maintain insurance with State Farm and there is a threat of future injury. (See
id.)
The
Court finds Plaintiffs have not stated sufficient facts to state a UCL cause of
action. As an initial matter, the Court agrees “bad faith insurance practices
may qualify as any of the three statutory forms of unfair competition. They are
unlawful; the insurer's obligation to act fairly and in good faith to meet its
contractual responsibilities is imposed by the common law, as well as by
statute. They are unfair to the insured; unfairness lies at the heart of a bad
faith cause of action. They may also qualify as fraudulent business practices.
Under the UCL, it is necessary only to show that the plaintiff was likely to be
deceived, and suffered economic injury as a result of the deception.” (Zhang,
57 Cal.4th at 380 (citations omitted).) And the Court also agrees Plaintiffs
can “borrow” from UIPA to state its UCL claim, as “Moradi-Shalal does
not preclude first party UCL actions based on grounds independent from [UIPA],
even when the insurer's conduct also violates [UIPA].” (Id. at 369
(emphasis added).)
Plaintiffs
must, however, actually assert grounds independent of UIPA that can
plausibly form the basis of their bad faith/UCL allegations. “[B]ecause [UIPA]
does not create a private civil cause of action, plaintiff could not plead
around that limitation by relying on conduct which violates only the UIPA as
the basis for a [UCL] cause of action.” (Manufacturers Life Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court (1995) 10 Cal.4th 257, 283.). The Court finds Plaintiffs
have not done so here. Plaintiffs allege improper denial of benefits owed to
them under their insurance policy, which is exactly the sort of “unfair claims
settlement practices” UIPA seeks to prohibit. (See Ins. Code § 790.03(h).)
Plaintiffs’ allegations mirror those unfair claims settlement practices listed
in Insurance Code § 790.03(h) and Plaintiffs do not allege any other bad faith
conduct on the part of State Farm.[2]
Accordingly,
the Court SUSTAINS State Farm’s Demurrer as to Plaintiffs’ third cause of
action for Violation of Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17200, et seq. WITH LEAVE TO
AMEND.  
B.            
Plaintiffs Fail to State Sufficient Facts to
State a Cause of Action for Financial Elder Abuse 
To state
a cause of action for financial elder abuse and neglect, a plaintiff must
allege “[f]inancial abuse, as defined in Section 15610.30.” (Welf. & Inst.
Code § 15610.07(a)(3).) Welfare & Institutions Code § 15610.30, in turn,
defines financial abuse of an elder adult as taking or assisting in taking real
or personal property for wrongful use and/or with intent to defraud, or by
undue influence. (See Welf. & Inst. Code §
15610.30(a)(1)-(3).) Financial abuse includes misappropriating funds to
which an elder is entitled under a contract. (See Paslay v. State Farm
General Insurance Co. (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 639, 656, 658.) Wrongful use “occurs
only when the party who violates the contract actually knows that it is
engaging in a harmful breach, or reasonably should be aware of the harmful
breach.” (Paslay, 248 Cal.App.4th at 658.)
State
Farm argues Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate it took or retained Plaintiffs’
property for a wrongful use. (Demurrer, pg. 11.) “Instead, Plaintiffs merely
reallege the same facts contained in their claim for breach of contract and
breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.” (Id.)
In
opposition, Plaintiffs argue they state sufficient facts to support their
fourth cause of action because they allege “State Farm arbitrarily and
unreasonably cutoff payment for temporary housing” and “wrongfully refused to
sufficiently pay for dwelling and contents damages in the face of overwhelming
evidence that it underpaid the claim.” (Opposition, pp. 5-6.)
The
Court finds Plaintiffs’ allegations insufficient to support a cause of action
for financial elder abuse and further agrees with State Farm that Plaintiffs’
allegations do not demonstrate wrongful use. As discussed above, Plaintiffs’
allegations, as currently stated, merely reflect State Farm’s allegedly
improper denial of the benefits owed to Plaintiffs under their insurance
policy. Without more, the Court finds Plaintiffs have not alleged wrongful use
and/or an intent to defraud as contemplated by Welfare & Institutions Code
§ 15610.30.
Accordingly,
the Court SUSTAINS State Farm’s Demurrer as to Plaintiffs’ fourth cause of
action for financial elder abuse WITH LEAVE TO AMEND. 
          C.      MOTION
TO STRIKE 
State Farm seeks to strike
portions of Plaintiffs’ Complaint as follows:
(1)  Pages
6-7, Paragraph 32 as follows: “The acts and omissions described above warrant
the imposition of exemplary damages under Civil Code section 3294 in an amount
sufficient to punish and deter State Farm from engaging in similar conduct in
the future”;
(2)  Page
7, Paragraph 38 in its entirety;
(3)  Page
10, Prayer Damages, Paragraph 4: attorneys’ fees on the “fourth cause[] of
action”; 
(4)  Page
10, Prayer for Damages, Paragraph 5 in its entirety; 
(5)  Page
10, Prayer for Damages, Paragraph 6 in its entirety; and
(6)  Page
10, Prayer for Damages, Paragraph 7 in its entirety.
(Motion, pg. 2.)
As an initial matter, since the
Court sustained State Farm’s Demurrer as to Plaintiffs’ third and fourth causes
of action, the Court therefore DENIES as moot State Farm’s Motion as to Page 7,
Paragraph 38; Page 10, Prayer Damages, Paragraph 4; Page 10, Prayer for Damages,
Paragraph 6; and Page 10, Prayer for Damages, Paragraph 7, as those paragraphs
are connected to Plaintiffs’ third and fourth causes of action.
Plaintiffs’ punitive damages
allegations are contained in Pages 6-7, Paragraph 32, and Page 10, Prayer for
Damages, Paragraph 5. Punitive damages
may be recovered upon a proper showing of malice, fraud, or oppression. (See
Code Civ. Proc. § 3294(a).) “Malice” is defined as conduct intended to
cause injury to a person or despicable conduct carried on with a willful and
conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others. (See Turman v.
Turning Point of Cent. Cal., Inc. (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 53, 63.)
“Oppression” means despicable conduct subjecting a person to cruel and unjust
hardship, in conscious disregard of the person’s rights. (See id.)
“Fraud” is an intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a
material fact known by defendant, with intent to deprive a person of property,
rights or otherwise cause injury. (See id.) Conclusory allegations,
devoid of any factual assertions, are insufficient to support a conclusion that
parties acted with oppression, fraud or malice. (See Smith v. Superior Court
(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1033, 1042.) 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS
State Farm’s Motion as to these paragraphs because the Court does not find
Plaintiffs’ allegations demonstrate malice, fraud, or oppression. Again, as
currently alleged, Plaintiffs’ allegations concern only their contention that
State Farm improperly denied them their benefits under their insurance policy. To succeed on a motion to strike punitive
damages allegations, it must be
said as a matter of law that the alleged behavior was not so vile, base, or
contemptible that it would not be looked down upon and despised by ordinary
decent people. (See Angie M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th
1217, 1228-1229.) The Court finds State Farm has successfully met its burden here.

Accordingly, the Court DENIES IN
PART and GRANTS IN PART State Farm’s Motion in accordance with its above
analysis WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.
VII.    
CONCLUSION
Based on
the foregoing, the Court SUSTAINS State Farm’s Demurrer as to Plaintiffs’ third
cause of action for Violation of Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17200, et seq. WITH
LEAVE TO AMEND.  
The
Court also SUSTAINS State Farm’s Demurrer as to Plaintiffs’ fourth cause of
action for financial elder abuse WITH LEAVE TO AMEND. 
The Court also DENIES IN PART and
GRANTS IN PART State Farm’s Motion to Strike in accordance with its above
analysis WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.
Plaintiffs have leave to file their amended
complaint in accordance with this Court’s rulings on or before November 1,
2024.  
          IT
IS SO ORDERED.
DATED:      October 10, 2024
