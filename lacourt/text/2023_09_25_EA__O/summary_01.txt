And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendants, CAPITALIST MASTERS GROUP and MANUEL MARQUEZ, to the Supplemental Answer to the Complaint (SAC). The judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff, MARTHA ISMELDA MORALES, will not be allowed to revise the SAC to address the defects identified by the court. The judge has also denied the motion to strike the complaint as moot, since the action is being dismissed.

The SAC, which was filed in response to the defendants' demurrer, failed to adequately plead the terms of the contract allegedly breached by the defendants. The judge found that the SAC contained contradictory allegations, unclear language, and failed to allege the necessary facts to support the plaintiff's claims. The judge also noted that the plaintiff had received multiple opportunities to cure the defects but failed to do so.

As a result, the court has dismissed the entire action, finding that the plaintiff's claims fail because the SAC does not adequately plead the necessary facts to support the claims. The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for leave to amend, concluding that any further amendments would be futile and would only serve to waste additional judicial resources.
