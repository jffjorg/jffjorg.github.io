And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendants, CAPITALIST MASTERS GROUP and MANUEL MARQUEZ, to the Supplemental Answer to the Complaint (SAC). The judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff, MARTHA ISMELDA MORALES, will not be allowed to revise the SAC to address the defects identified by the court. The judge has also denied the motion to strike the complaint as moot, since the action is being dismissed.

The SAC, which was filed in response to the defendants' demurrer, failed to adequately plead the terms of the contract allegedly breached by the defendants. The judge found that the SAC contained contradictory allegations, unclear language, and failed to allege the necessary facts to support the plaintiff's claims. The judge also noted that the plaintiff had received multiple opportunities to cure the defects but failed to do so.

As a result, the court has dismissed the entire action, finding that the plaintiff's claims fail because the SAC does not adequately plead the necessary facts to support the claims. The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for leave to amend, concluding that any further amendments would be futile and would only serve to waste additional judicial resources.

## Case Summary: 22PSCV00627

**Case Number:** 22PSCV00627
**Hearing Date:** September 25, 2023
**Department:** O

**Plaintiff:** Martha Ismelda Morales
**Defendant:** CAPITALIST MASTERS GROUP and MANUEL MARQUEZ

**Background:**

This case involves a real property dispute. Plaintiff alleges she hired Defendants to help transfer property from her uncle to herself.  She claims Defendants offered a loan instead of refinancing, and after making payments, Defendants demanded a balloon payment she wasn't aware of.

**Plaintiff's Allegations:**

* Plaintiff sought help from Defendant Marquez (principal of CMG) to transfer property.
* Defendants offered a loan of $23,621.24, with a total repayment of $29,970 by June 2020.
* Plaintiff sought further assistance from Defendants in May 2020, and they agreed to transfer the property and refinance the loan.
* Defendants added a family friend (Barajas) as a co-borrower and increased the loan amount to $265,374 without Plaintiff's consent.
* Defendants pressured Plaintiff, her uncle, and Barajas to sign agreements without explaining the terms.
* Plaintiff never received copies of the purchase agreement or promissory note.
* Plaintiff made payments until Defendants returned her last check in May 2022.
* Plaintiff alleges Defendants informed her of a balloon payment via a letter demanding payment based on a promissory note not attached to the complaint.

**Defendant's Demurrer:**

Defendants demurred on the grounds that Plaintiff's complaint fails to state a cause of action because it:

* Does not adequately plead the terms of the alleged contract.
* Contains contradictory allegations.

**Judge's Ruling:**

The judge sustained the demurrer **without leave to amend**. 

* The court found Plaintiff's complaint insufficiently pled the terms of the alleged agreement, despite being given three opportunities to amend.
* The court noted contradictory allegations in the complaint regarding the nature of the transaction and whether Plaintiff was pressured into signing.
* The judge ruled that Plaintiff's failure to cure the defects and refute Defendants' arguments suggests further amendment would be futile.


**Key Points:**

* Plaintiff must clearly state the terms of the alleged contract and how Defendants allegedly breached it.
* The complaint must be consistent and not contain contradictory allegations.
* Plaintiff has exhausted her opportunities to amend her complaint.

**Case Number: 22PSCV00627**
**Hearing Date: September 25, 2023**

**Parties:**

- Plaintiff: Martha Ismelda Morales
- Defendants: Capitalist Masters Group and Manuel Marquez

**Factual Background:**

This case involves real property. Plaintiff Morales alleges that in May 2019, she sought the help of Defendant Marquez, the principal of CMG, to transfer the subject property from her uncle to herself. However, after making payments, she discovered that the entire loan balance was due.

**Plaintiff's Claims:**

On June 23, 2022, Plaintiff Morales filed suit against Defendants for:

1. Violation of Business and Professions Code 17500;
2. Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing;
3. Promissory Estoppel;
4. Fraud;
5. Breach of Contract;
6. Temporary Restraining Order, Preliminary Injunction; and
7. Declaratory and Injunctive Relief.

**Procedural History:**

- October 31, 2022: Defendants filed a demurrer to the original complaint, which was sustained with leave to amend.
- January 17, 2023: Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC), adding a claim for Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED).
- June 2, 2023: Defendants filed a demurrer to the FAC, which was sustained with leave to amend.
- July 21, 2023: Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint (SAC).
- August 21, 2023: Defendants filed an instant demurrer to the SAC.
- September 14, 2023: Plaintiff filed her opposition; Defendants filed their Reply.

**Tentative Ruling:**

1. Defendants' demurrer to the SAC is sustained without leave to amend.
2. Defendants' motion to strike Plaintiff's complaint is denied/moot as the case is dismissed.

**Legal Standard:**

A demurrer may be made on the grounds that the pleading does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and/or that the pleading is uncertain.

**Discussion:**

The court has previously sustained demurrers due to the complaint's uncertainty and lack of specificity regarding the contract(s) involved. The SAC suffers from the same defects, as it fails to adequately allege the terms of the agreement and how Defendants allegedly breached the loan agreement. Moreover, the SAC contains contradictory allegations.

Plaintiff Morales has had multiple opportunities to cure these defects, but has failed to do so. Therefore, the court sustains the demurrer without leave to amend and denies the motion to strike as moot.
