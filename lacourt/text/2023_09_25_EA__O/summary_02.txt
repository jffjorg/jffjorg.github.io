And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike a Statement of Allegations (SAC) filed by the Plaintiff. The SAC was filed late, and the Defendant is correct that the Plaintiff did not file a noticed motion for leave to file the SAC, as required by the court. Despite this, the Judge has exercised its discretion to consider the SAC, citing the strong policy favoring disposition of cases on their merits. The Judge notes that the SAC is unclear as to the nature of the claims, and therefore cannot reach the issue of sham pleading. The case has been ongoing for some time, with the Plaintiff having filed two previous demurrers.
