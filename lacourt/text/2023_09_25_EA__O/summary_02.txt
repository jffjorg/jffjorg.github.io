The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike a Statement of Allegations (SAC) filed by the Plaintiff. The SAC was filed late, and the Defendant is correct that the Plaintiff did not file a noticed motion for leave to file the SAC, as required by the court. Despite this, the Judge has exercised its discretion to consider the SAC, citing the strong policy favoring disposition of cases on their merits. The Judge notes that the SAC is unclear as to the nature of the claims, and therefore cannot reach the issue of sham pleading. The case has been ongoing for some time, with the Plaintiff having filed two previous demurrers.

## English Summary

The judge is considering a motion to strike the Plaintiff's amended complaint (SAC) because it was filed after the deadline set by the court.  Although the Plaintiff did not seek permission to file the SAC late, the judge will consider it anyway due to a policy favoring resolving cases on their merits. 

The judge notes that this is the third demurrer in the case and points out that the Plaintiff has removed an allegation from the SAC about signing blank pages.  The judge finds that it is too early to determine if this omission constitutes an attempt to mislead the court, as the SAC is still unclear about the specific facts of the case.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding the motion to strike the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) filed by the plaintiff. The defendants argue that the SAC was filed after the expiration of the time allowed for amendment, and the plaintiff did not obtain permission from the court to file the SAC. The judge agrees with the defendants, but exercises discretion to consider the SAC due to the strong policy favoring disposition of cases on their merits. The SAC is the third demurrer in the case, and the plaintiff has omitted previous allegations, including the claim that they signed blank pages. The defendants argue that this omission constitutes sham pleading, but the judge cannot reach that issue due to the lack of clarity in the SAC. The lawsuit acknowledges that the defendants performed certain contractual obligations, as the plaintiff has standing to file the lawsuit. The judge will consider the SAC despite its timeliness issues.

### English Summary
The Judge's tentative ruling addresses the motion to strike the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) filed by the Plaintiff. The Defendants argue that the SAC was untimely filed, and the court agrees. However, the Judge decides to exercise discretion and consider the SAC in light of the strong policy favoring disposition of cases on their merits. The Plaintiff's SAC has omitted certain allegations, but the court cannot determine if this constitutes sham pleading due to the unclear nature of the claims and facts. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff's lawsuit implies that the Defendants performed certain contractual obligations, as the Plaintiff would not have standing to file the lawsuit if title had not been transferred to her. The ruling highlights the complexities of the case and the need for further clarification on the claims and facts presented.

**Significant Statements:**

* The court cannot reach the issue of sham pleading as the SAC is unclear

This is the third demurrer in this case. The judge intends to consider the SAC despite its untimely filing, as there is a strong policy favoring disposition of cases on their merits. The SAC omits the previous allegation that Plaintiff signed blank pages, but the court cannot determine how the omission of certain facts amounts to sham pleading, as the SAC is largely unclear as to the nature of the claims and specific facts. The court notes that the performance of certain contractual obligations is inherently acknowledged by the lawsuit, as Plaintiff is the named Plaintiff and had title not been transferred to Plaintiff, she would not have standing to file the lawsuit.
