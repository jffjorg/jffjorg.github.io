[1] CMG is a lending
company. (SAC ¶2.) 
 


[2] The premise of the
motion to strike is that the SAC was untimely filed. Defendants are correct.
The court required a SAC be filed by July 19, 2023. (See June 29, 2023 minute
order: [“Plaintiff's Counsel is Ordered to file an Amended Complaint on or before
July 19, 2023.”].) “After expiration of the time in which a pleading can be
amended as a matter of course, the pleading can only be amended by obtaining
the permission of the court.” (Motion p. 3, citing Leader v. Health Indus.
Of Am., Inc. (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 603, 613-614.) Here, despite expiration
of the time to file a SAC, Plaintiff did not file a noticed motion for leave,
making a motion to strike the SAC proper as it was filed in disregard for
established procedural processes. (Id. at p. 613.) That said, “in light of the
strong policy favoring disposition of cases on their merits,” the court
exercises its discretion to consider the SAC. (Parkview Villas Assn., Inc. v. State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. (2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 1197, 1202.) 
 


[3] Thus, this is the
third demurrer in this case. 
 


[4] As noted by
Defendants, Plaintiff’s SAC now omits the previous allegation that Plaintiff
signed blank pages. While Defendants argue that Plaintiff has engaged in sham
pleading, the court cannot reach that issue as the SAC is still largely unclear
as to the nature of the claims and specific of the facts to determine how the
omission of certain facts amounts to sham pleading. 


[5] In fact, Defendants’
performance of certain contractual obligation(s) is inherently acknowledged by
the lawsuit because Plaintiff is the named Plaintiff (not the uncle); had title
not been transferred to Plaintiff, she would not have standing to file the
instant lawsuit.
