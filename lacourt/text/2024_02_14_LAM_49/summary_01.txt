And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge grants the Defendant's Motion to Bifurcate, which seeks to try the affirmative statute of limitation defense before trial of any other issue in the case. The Judge finds that a one-year statute of limitations applies to all claims in this action, and that bifurcation is necessary to avoid unnecessary prejudice to the parties and court. The Judge concludes that the statute of limitations defense should be tried first, as the critical question or issue in this case is whether Plaintiffs' claims are time-barred. The Judge also notes that there is little, if any, overlap between the evidence underlying the statute of limitations issue and the evidence underlying the substance of the malpractice claims, and that bifurcation would not result in the duplication of evidence.
