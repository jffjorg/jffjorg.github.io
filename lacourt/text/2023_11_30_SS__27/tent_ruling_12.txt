MOVING PARTY:            Defendant Seth Meyers
RESPONDING PARTY:    None

I.         BACKGROUND
On
August 19, 2022, Plaintiffs George Heinen (“Heinen”), Jordan Saunders
(“Saunders”), and Damon Jackson (“Jackson”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed
this action against Defendants Seth Meyers (“Meyers”) and Does 1 to 20,
asserting two causes of action for (1) motor vehicle injury and (2) general
negligence. 
The
Attachments to the Complaint allege the following. On or about September 13,
2020, Plaintiffs Heinen and Jackson were passengers in Saunders’s vehicle and
were stopped at a stop sign at the intersection of Woodrow Wilson Dr. and
Cahuenga Blvd. in Los Angeles, CA. Meyers was driving directly behind
Plaintiffs when he negligently rear-ended Plaintiffs’ vehicle. Meyers then fled
the scene, traveling southbound on Mulholland Drive, resulting in a hit-and-run.
All three Plaintiffs sustained significant injuries. 
On
March 22, 2023, Meyers filed the instant three (3) motions seeking orders
compelling each of the three Plaintiffs to serve responses to Meyers’s Request
for Production of Documents, Set One. Meyers also seeks orders imposing
sanctions of $960 per motion against Plaintiffs and their counsel of record, Robert
B. Gibson of Gibson & Hughes and Brent D. Rawlings of The Ledger Law Firm,
jointly and severally. 
On
November 13, 2023, Robert B. Gibson, Esq., one of the counsels of record for
Plaintiffs, filed a motion to be relieved as counsel. The hearing for that
motion is set for December 13, 2023. 
As
of November 28, 2023, no oppositions to the motions have been filed.
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
 
Within 30 days after service of a
request for the production of documents, the responding party shall serve
responses to the discovery “unless on motion” the court has shortened or
extended the time for response. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a).) 
Failure to serve timely responses to
requests for production of documents results in the responding party waiving
any objection to the discovery requests, including those based on privilege and
work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).)
Sanctions are mandatory in connection
with motions to compel requests for production of documents against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel
unless the court “finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300, subd.
(c).) 
Under California Rules of Court, rule
3.1348, subdivision (a), “[t]he court may award sanctions under the Discovery
Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no
opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn,
or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion
was filed.”
III.      DISCUSSION
Meyers
argues that each of the three (3) plaintiffs has failed to serve responses to his
Requests for Production, Set One (the “RPDs”). 
Defense
counsel attests to the following facts in support of the motions. On December
19, 2022, Meyers served his RPDs on the three (3) Plaintiffs.
(Declarations
of Attorney Brian Leach, filed in support of the motions on March 22, 2023 (“Leach
Decl.”), ¶ 2; Exhibits A – copies of the RPDs.) On January 12, 2023, defense
counsel received an email from Gibson & Hughes informing the former that
Robert B. Gibson had associated in as counsel and requesting the deadline to
serve the responses to be extended to February 19, 2023. (Leach Decl., ¶ 3.) On
February 28, 2023, having not received answers to the RPDs, defense counsel
sent an email to Plaintiffs’ counsel requesting the answers by March 10, 2023.
(Leach Decl., ¶ 3.) Meyers had yet to receive Plaintiffs’ responses to the RPDs
as of the date of drafting the motions. (Leach Decl., ¶ 4.) 
In
light of defense counsel’s declarations and Plaintiffs’ failure to file any
opposition, the Court finds it proper to grant the request to compel their
responses to the RPDs.
Sanctions are mandatory in connection
with motions to compel requests for production of documents against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel
unless the court “finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).) 
Under California Rules of Court, rule
3.1348(a), “[t]he court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of
a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to
the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the
requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was
filed.”
Here, Defendants seek sanctions of $960
per motion (total of $2,880). Defense counsel testifies that the requested
sanctions of $960 consist of 1 hour counsel spent on the moving papers, 0.5
hours he anticipated spending drafting a reply, 0.5 hours he expects to spend
appearing at the hearing, a total of 2 hours at his billing rate of $450 per
hour (equals $900), plus a $60 filing fee. (Leach Decl., ¶¶ 5, 6.)
The
Court finds the requested sanctions excessive because no reply (or opposition
that would necessitate a reply) was filed. 
Accordingly,
the Court will grant the request for sanctions but will deduct 0.5 hours at
counsel’s billing rate of $450 per hour (i.e., $225), leaving sanctions of $735
per motion (i.e., the requested sanctions of $960 minus $225). 
The
Court will impose sanctions on Plaintiffs only based on counsel’s statement at
the hearing on similar motions on November 29, 2023, that the reason for
noncompliance was the lack of cooperation by defendants. 
IV.      CONCLUSION
          The Court rules on Defendant Seth Meyers’s motions as follows. 
          The request to compel Plaintiffs
George Heinen, Jordan Saunders, and Damon Jackson’s initial responses to the
defendant’s Requests for Production (Set One) is GRANTED. Plaintiffs are
ordered to serve code-compliant responses, without objections, to those
requests within thirty (30) days of this ruling. 
The
request for sanctions is also GRANTED. Plaintiffs are ordered to pay sanctions
of $2,205 (i.e., $735 for each of the three (3) motions) to the defendant. 
Moving
party to give notice.  
            Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SSCDEPT27@lacourt.org indicating intention to submit
on the tentative as directed by the instructions provided on the court’s
website at www.lacourt.org.  Please be
advised that if you submit on the tentative and elect not to appear at the
hearing, the opposing party may nevertheless appear at the hearing and argue
the matter.  Unless you receive a
submission from all other parties in the matter, you should assume that others
might appear at the hearing to argue.  If
the Court does not receive emails from the parties indicating submission on
this tentative ruling and there are no appearances at the hearing, the Court
may, at its discretion, adopt the tentative as the final order or place the
motion off calendar.
