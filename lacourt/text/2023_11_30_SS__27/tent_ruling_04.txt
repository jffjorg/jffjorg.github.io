I.                  
INTRODUCTION
On April 14, 2021, plaintiff Brian Meredith (“Plaintiff”) filed
this action against defendant Oluwafeyiropo Ologitere (“Defendant”), arising
out of a November 11, 2020, motor vehicle collision.     
On August 1, 2023, Defendant served special
interrogatories and requests for production  on Plaintiff.  On September 8, 2023, Defendant’s counsel sent
a meet and confer letter to Plaintiff’s counsel regarding the overdue discovery
responses and requesting that responses be served by no later than September
15, 2023. Without receiving any responses, on September 20, 2023, Defendant’s
counsel sent a second meet and confer letter to Plaintiff’s counsel requesting
responses by September 27, 2023.  
Plaintiff did not provide responses.
On October 3, 2023, Defendant filed the instant motions to compel (1)
Plaintiff’s Responses to Defendant’s Requests for Production of Documents (Set
Two) and (2) Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to Special Interrogatories.  Defendant also requested monetary sanction of
$1,185.00 for each motion.
Plaintiff has not filed an opposition. 
II.               
LEGAL
STANDARDS
A.    Initial Discovery Responses 
If a party to whom interrogatories and
inspection demands were directed fails to serve a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order to compel responses without objections.
 (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd.
(b), 2031.300, subd. (b).)  Moreover,
failure to timely serve responses waives objections to the requests. (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.280, subd. (a), 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300, subd. (a).)  
B.     Sanctions
Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030 is a general statute authorizing the Court to impose discovery
sanctions for “misuse of the discovery process.” Further, under Califonria
Rules of Court, the court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor
of a party who files a motion to compel discovery,
even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion
was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party
after the motion was filed.  Cal. Rule of
Court 3.1348.
III.            
DISCUSSION
Discovery Responses
Plaintiff did not provide responses
to either the requests for production or interrogatories.  He must do so.  Accordingly, he is ordered to provide
responses, without objection, to the requests for production and
interrogatories within 30 days of this order. 

Sanctions
Defendant requests that Plaintiff and
his counsel, be ordered, jointly and severally, be ordered to pay $1,185.00 for
each motion brought, based on the time counsel spent on the motion and time counsel
expected to spend on a reply and hearing. 
 However, since Defendant’s
counsel did not have an opposition to reply to, and because the motions were
substantially the same, the amount of sanctions is reduced by $1,750 in
total.  Plaintiff and his counsel,
jointly and severally, are ordered to pay $1,750 in sanctions to Defendant
within 30 days of this order.  
IV.            
CONCLUSION
Defendant’s motions to compel are GRANTED and Plaintiff is hereby
ordered to provide responses to the requests for production and special
interrogatories, without objection, within 30 days of this order and to pay
$1,750, also within 30 days of this order.
