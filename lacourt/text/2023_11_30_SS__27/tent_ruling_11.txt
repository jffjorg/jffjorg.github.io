[1] The Court notes that a “Diamante
Electric, Inc.” is not a named party in this action. The Court infers that Diamante
Electric & Construction may have been improperly identified in the
Amendment to Complaint and cross-complaint, Diamante Electric &
Construction may be doing business as Diamante Electric, Inc., or it is
possible that there has been a change in the name of the company since the
filing of this action. The Court orders the parties to identify themselves
accurately and consistently in pleadings and filings to avoid confusion and
inconsistent rulings.
