Claimant Jose
 Sierra (“Claimant”), a minor, by and through their Guardian Ad Litem Maria
 Sierra (“Petitioner”), has agreed to settle claims against Defendant Jordan
 Hernandez in exchange for $4,000,000.00.  If approved, $708,668.87
will be used for medical expenses,  $1,600,000.00
 will be used for attorney’s fees, and $117,810.59
will be used for non-medical expenses, leaving a balance of $1,573,520.54
for Claimant with $1,000,000.00 to be invested in a single-premium deferred annuity,
subject to withdrawal only upon authorization of the court and $573,520.54
to be paid or transferred to the trustee of a special needs trust
established under Probate Code section 3604.
Court approval is required for all
settlements of a person with a disability’s claim.  (Probate Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; Code Civ. Proc. § 372.)  The Court has reviewed the proposed
settlement and the finds the following defects preclude granting the Petition
at this time: 

When
     seeking approval of a special needs trust, notice of the hearing and
     service of the petition must be made upon three state agencies including
     the Dept. of Mental Health, Dept. of Developmental Services, and Dept. of
     Health Care Services. (Probate Code sections 3602(f), 3611(c).). The
     proof of service attached to the petition does not indicate notice to the
     state agencies and there is no separately-filed proof of service for
     them. 
The
     proposed trust instrument does not contain the terms required by LASC rule
     4.116(b)(2)-(4).
At
     least one week prior to the continued hearing, petitioner shall file an
     amended petition attaching a revised proposed special needs trust
     instrument and file a notice of hearing with proof of service for the
     amended petition.  

The unopposed Petition to approve compromise
of disputed claim is CONTINUED to ___________________________ _____, 2023.
Moving party to give notice.
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SSCDEPT27@lacourt.org indicating
intention to submit on the tentative as directed by the instructions provided
on the court website at www.lacourt.org. 
Please be advised that if you submit on the tentative and elect not to
appear at the hearing, the opposing party may nevertheless appear at the
hearing and argue the matter.  Unless you
receive a submission from all other parties in the matter, you should assume
that others might appear at the hearing to argue.  If the Court does not receive emails from the
parties indicating submission on this tentative ruling and there are no
appearances at the hearing, the Court may, at its discretion, adopt the
tentative as the final order or place the motion off calendar.
