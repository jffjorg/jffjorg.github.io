And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the proposed settlement between Claimant Jose Sierra and Defendant Jordan Hernandez and has found that the petition to approve the compromise of disputed claim is not yet ready for approval. The proposed trust instrument does not contain the required terms, and notice of the hearing and service of the petition has not been made upon three state agencies as required by law. The judge has ordered that the petition be continued to a future date, pending the filing of an amended petition with a revised trust instrument and proof of service. The moving party is directed to give notice, and parties who wish to submit on the tentative must email the court indicating their intention to do so.
