Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel further responses to interrogatories without prejudice. The motion was procedurally improper because the defendant failed to meet the informal discovery conference requirement, did not provide a separate statement as required by the court's rules, and did not attach plaintiff's purportedly deficient responses to the interrogatories to the declaration of counsel in support of the motion. Additionally, the plaintiff's unverified responses to the interrogatories were deemed tantamount to no responses at all, and the defendant should have filed a motion to compel initial responses under California Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290. The judge noted that the parties who intend to submit on the tentative must send an email to the court and that the hearing will proceed as scheduled.
