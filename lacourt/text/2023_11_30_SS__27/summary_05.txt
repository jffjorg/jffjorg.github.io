And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion filed by Hussein Saleh, attorney for Maria Vega, seeking to be relieved as counsel due to a complete breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The court allowed Mr. Saleh to correct deficiencies in his request, but a Notice of Change of Handling Attorney was subsequently filed, indicating that the motion to withdraw is now moot. Therefore, the court grants the motion to withdraw as counsel, as the circumstances that led to the motion have changed.
