The judge has issued a tentative ruling on November 30, 2023, in the case of Luciana Littlewolf and Jazmin Alejandra Littlewolf against Colonial Inn, 534 East Foothill LLC, Hamid Hamedis, and Does 1-20. The plaintiffs filed an action against the defendants on June 10, 2019, alleging that they suffered injuries due to bedbug bites during their stay at the defendants' hotel. The plaintiffs served Form Interrogatories and Requests for Admission on the defendants on June 27, 2023, but the defendants failed to respond.

The judge has granted the plaintiffs' motion to compel the defendants to provide responses to the Form Interrogatories and Requests for Admission, and has ordered the defendants to provide responses within 30 days. The judge has also granted the plaintiffs' motion to deem the Requests for Admission admitted.

The judge has imposed monetary sanctions on the defendants and their counsel in the amount of $2,500.00, to be paid within 30 days. The judge has also granted the plaintiffs' request for sanctions in the amount of $2500, which was reduced from the original amount of $2,100.00.

The parties are advised to submit on the tentative ruling and indicate their intention to do so by email to the court. If the parties do not submit on the tentative ruling, they may still appear at the hearing to argue the matter.
