I.           
INTRODUCTION
This
action arises from Plaintiff allegedly being attacked by a dog. On April 26,
2023, Plaintiff Jaheim Martin (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against
Defendants Malin Asset Management, Klint Brenna aka Klint Bremma, Benna Kay
Klink, Charlavonna M. Barrett, and Does 1 through 100, alleging causes of
action for strict liability and general negligence. 
On
June 3, 2023, Defendant Charlavonna M. Barrett filed a cross-complaint against
Brenna Kay Klink and Roes 1 to 10, alleging causes of action for
indemnification, apportionment of fault, and declaratory relief. 
On
October 10, 2023, Defendant Charlavonna M. Barrett (“Moving Defendant”) filed a
motion to compel Plaintiff’s further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set
One, Numbers 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 2.10, 2.11, 2.12, 2.13,
4.1, 4.2, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4,
8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 9.1, 9.2, 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 11.1, 11.2, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3,
12.4, 12.5, 12.6, 12.7, 13.1, 13.2, 14.1, and 14.2 (the “Form
Interrogatories”), which were originally served upon Plaintiff on June 23, 2023
(the “Motion”). The Motion is made on the grounds that Plaintiff served
objection-only responses to Moving Defendant’s Form Interrogatories. Moving
Defendant does not request any monetary sanctions for bringing the Motion.
On
October 25, 2023, the Court granted N. Alex Lopez’s motion to be relieved as
counsel for Plaintiff. On November 2, 2023, a proof of service was filed
indicating that Plaintiff was served with the order granting the motion to be
relieved as counsel. 
On
November 28, 2023, an Informal Discovery Conference (“IDC”) was scheduled. The
IDC was not called for a hearing and there was no appearance by or for
Plaintiff and there was no communication with the Court as to why there was no
appearance. (11/28/23 Minute Order.) The Court ruled from chambers that Moving
Defendant “has met the informal discovery conference requirement.” (Id.)

The
Motion is unopposed. Any opposition to the Motion was required to have been
filed and served at least nine court days prior to the hearing. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) 
II.      LEGAL STANDARD 
In California, discovery statutes “must
be construed liberally in favor of disclosure unless the request is clearly
improper.” (Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 541.)
“Under the discovery statutes, information is discoverable if it is
unprivileged and is either relevant to the subject matter of the action or
reasonably calculated to reveal admissible evidence.” (John B. v. Superior
Court (2006) 38 Cal.4th 1177, 1186.) “Discovery may relate to the claim or
defense of the party seeking discovery or of any other party to the action.” (Ibid.)
A party may move for an order
compelling a further response to interrogatories where an answer to a
particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.300, subd. (a)(1).) A further response to interrogatories may also be
compelled where an objection is without merit or is too general. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a)(3).)  
III.    DISCUSSION 
Issue No.1: Lack of Meet and Confer 
          “The
Discovery Act requires that, prior to the initiation of a motion to compel, the
moving party declare that he or she has made a serious attempt to obtain an
informal resolution of each issue.” (Stewart v. Colonial Western Agency,
Inc. (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 1006, 1016.) “A meet and confer declaration in
support of a motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith
attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.) 
The Court finds that the meet and
confer requirement has not been met under Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040. (Rickett
Decl., ¶ 6 and Exhibit B.) Moving Defendant’s counsel sent a letter to Plaintiff’s
counsel requesting further responses to the Form Interrogatories and raising
the issue of Plaintiff’s objections to the Form Interrogatories. (Id.) Counsel’s
meet and confer correspondence, however, did not address the lack of
verifications to the Form Interrogatories even though counsel attests that
Plaintiff provided unverified responses. (Rickett Decl., ¶ 6.) Counsel merely
wrote that “Plaintiff’s responses are incomplete, inadequate, and not well
taken.” (Id., ¶ 6 and Exhibit B.) 
          While the
Court can deny the motion solely on this ground, the Court will discuss
additional procedural issues with the Motion.  
Issue No.2: Procedural Compliance
          A motion to
compel further responses to interrogatories requires a separate statement.
(Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345, subd. (a).) “The separate statement must be
full and complete so that no person is required to review any other document in
order to determine the full request and the full response.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1345, subd. (c).) “The separate statement must include—for each
discovery request (e.g., each interrogatory, request for admission, deposition
question, or inspection demand) to which a further response . . . is requested
. . . the text of the request, interrogatory, question, or inspection demand.”
(Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345, subd. (c)(1).) 
Moreover, a separate statement must
include “[a] statement of the factual and legal reasons for compelling further
responses . . . as to each matter in dispute.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
3.1345, subd. (c)(3).) A separate statement is not required “(1) When no
response has been provided to the request for discovery; or (2) When a court
has allowed the moving party to submit—in place of a separate statement—a
concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute.” (Cal.
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345, subd. (b).) A court has discretion to deny a
motion to compel discovery where the separate statement is procedurally
non-compliant. (Mills v. U.S. Bank (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 871, 891-892.)

          The Court
finds that Moving Defendant’s Separate Statement in support of the Motion is
deficient. The Court has not allowed Moving Defendant to submit a concise
outline of the discovery request and responses in dispute and Moving Defendant
does not contend that no responses were received. Moving Defendant has failed
to set forth the text of the disputed interrogatories in the Separate
Statement. Moving Defendant has only included the following in the Separate
Statement pursuant to each interrogatory: (1) Plaintiff’s Responses; and (2) Moving
Defendant’s Requested Further Response. 
          Additionally,
the Court also finds that inconsistencies exist with the Memorandum of Points
and Authorities and the Separate Statement. While the Memorandum of Points and
Authorities states that Plaintiff objected to the Form Interrogatories, the
Separate Statement indicates that Plaintiff failed to answer certain
interrogatories or provided answers to some interrogatories. (Separate
Statement at 7:11-13, 9:14-16.) 
Moreover, the Court notes that
Plaintiff’s discovery responses are not before the Court. Moving Defendant did
not attach Plaintiff’s purportedly deficient responses to the Form
Interrogatories to the declaration of counsel in support of the Motion. The
only documents before the Court are: (1) the Form Interrogatories propounded by
Moving Defendant to Plaintiff, and (2) counsel’s meet and confer
correspondence. 
          Thus, the
Motion is procedurally deficient. 
Issue No.3: Plaintiff’s Unverified Responses
          In support of
the Motion, Moving Defendant’s counsel declares that Plaintiff provided unverified
responses to the Form Interrogatories. (Rickett Decl., ¶ 6.) 
“Unverified responses are tantamount to
no responses at all.” (Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d
632, 636.) 
Given that Plaintiff provided no
verifications to the Form Interrogatories, Moving Defendant’s instant motion to
compel further responses is procedurally improper. Moving Defendant should have
filed a motion to compel responses under Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, which addresses
motions to compel initial responses to interrogatories. The Court cannot rule
on a motion to compel further responses when no responses have been received
under Appleton v. Superior Court, supra, 206 Cal.App.3d 632 due
to the lack of verifications.  
 
The Motion is therefore DENIED WITHOUT
PREJUDICE. The Court cannot reach the merits of the Motion or grant the Motion as
it is procedurally improper. 
 
IV.     CONCLUSION
The Motion is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.

 
Moving party is ordered to give notice
of this ruling. 
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SSCDEPT27@lacourt.org indicating
intention to submit on the tentative as directed by the instructions provided
on the court website at www.lacourt.org. 
Please be advised that if you submit on the tentative and elect not to
appear at the hearing, the opposing party may nevertheless appear at the
hearing and argue the matter.  Unless you
receive a submission from all other parties in the matter, you should assume
that others might appear at the hearing to argue.  If the Court does not receive emails from the
parties indicating submission on this tentative ruling and there are no
appearances at the hearing, the Court may, at its discretion, adopt the
tentative as the final order or place the motion off calendar.
