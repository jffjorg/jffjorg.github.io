The motion was filed by Defendant Diamante Electric, Inc. ("DEI"). The Court finds that the complaint does not allege sufficient facts showing malice, fraud, or oppression to warrant the imposition of punitive damages against DEI, and therefore grants the motion with 20 days leave to amend. The Court also notes that the meet and confer requirement was met, and that DEI is a corporate defendant, and the complaint does not allege any oppression, fraud, or malice on the part of DEI by an officer, director, or managing agent.
