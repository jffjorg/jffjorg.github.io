Summary in English text:

The Judge, Lee S. Arian, has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for summary judgment filed by Defendant Martha Traub. The case is Alba Guillermina Carmona Suarez, et al. v. Martha Traub, et al. (19STCV05946). The motion is based on the allegation that Defendant Traub was not the driver of the vehicle involved in a motor vehicle accident on February 23, 2017.

Defendant Traub argues that since she was not the driver or owner of the vehicle, she does not owe a duty to use due care, and therefore, she did not breach any duty. Additionally, Defendant Traub argues that her conduct did not cause the injuries.

The Judge has reviewed the evidence and has found that Defendant Traub has met her prima facie case to establish that no triable issue of fact exists. Since Plaintiff Suarez did not file an opposition to the motion, the Judge has granted the motion for summary judgment in favor of Defendant Traub. The ruling states that summary judgment is appropriate because Plaintiffs do not meet their burden to rebut the prima facie case.
