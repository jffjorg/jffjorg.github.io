And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Lee S. Arian in the case of Jordan Saunders, George Heinen, and Damon Jackson (Plaintiffs) vs. Seth Meyers (Defendant). The case involves a motor vehicle accident on September 13, 2020, in which Meyers rear-ended the Plaintiffs' vehicle, causing significant injuries. The Plaintiffs have failed to serve timely responses to Defendant's Requests for Production of Documents (RPDs), and Defendant has filed motions to compel response and for monetary sanctions.

The Court finds that the Plaintiffs have waived any objections to the discovery requests and that sanctions are mandatory in connection with motions to compel requests for production of documents. The Court grants the Defendant's motions to compel response and imposes sanctions of $735 per motion, totaling $2,205.

The Court also finds that the requested sanctions of $960 are excessive and deducts $225 from the total sanctions. The Court orders the Plaintiffs to serve code-compliant responses to the RPDs within 30 days and to pay the reduced sanctions of $735 per motion.
