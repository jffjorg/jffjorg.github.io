[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL

On October 13, 2023, Hussein Saleh,
attorney of record for Plaintiff, sought to be relieved on the grounds that
there had been a complete breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. On
November 6, 2023, the Court continued the Motion to allow counsel to correct
deficiencies in his request.  
On November 20, 2023, a Notice of
Change of Handling Attorney within the same firm was filed. It appears then
that the motion to withdraw is moot.
 
Dated: November 30, 2023
