And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendants, Sivaprasad Mullangi, M.D., Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center, Shahrukh Mohsin, M.D., and Hsin-Chen Liu, D.O., have filed demurrers to the complaint, arguing that the allegations are insufficient to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The court has sustained all three demurrers, finding that the complaint lacks specificity in its allegations of what acts or omissions the defendants committed, when they occurred, and what injury resulted. The court has granted the defendants 20 days to amend their responses to the complaint.
