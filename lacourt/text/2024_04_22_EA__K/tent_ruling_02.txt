1.         Demurrer
Re: Mullangi
Legal Standard
A
demurrer may be made on the grounds that the pleading, inter alia, does not
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.10, subd. (e).)
When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of
the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A
demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic
matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the
pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984)
153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905 [citations omitted].) At the pleading stage, a
plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant
of the factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) “[A] demurrer
does not, however, admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law
alleged in the pleading, or the construction placed on an instrument pleaded
therein, or facts impossible in law, or allegations contrary to facts of which
a court may take judicial knowledge.” (S.
Shore Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732 [citations
omitted].)
Discussion
Mullangi demurs, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 430.10,
subdivision (e), to Plaintiff’s complaint, on the basis that it fails to state
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.

Mullangi’s demurrer
is sustained. Code of Civil Procedure § 425.10 provides that a complaint should
contain “[a] statement of the facts constituting the cause of action, in
ordinary and concise language.” (Perkins
v. Superior Court (1981) 117
Cal.App.3d 1, 6 [“What is important is that the complaint as a whole contain
sufficient facts to apprise the defendant of the basis upon which the plaintiff
is seeking relief”].) “Ordinarily, negligence may be alleged in general terms,
without specific facts showing how the injury occurred, but there are limits to
the generality with which a plaintiff is permitted to state his cause of
action, and . . . the plaintiff must indicate the acts or omissions which are
said to have been negligently performed. He may not recover upon the bare
statement that the defendant's negligence has caused him injury.” (Berkeley
v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 527).
Here, Plaintiff has
alleged that she underwent unspecified medical treatment performed by
defendants (which include one hospital and twelve physicians) at an unspecified
time and that she suffered an unspecified injury as a result. (See Complaint,
¶¶ 20, 24 and 26-28). The complaint is devoid of any allegations as to what
acts or omissions Plaintiff claims Mullangi or any of the other defendants
committed, when this occurred and what injury resulted.
