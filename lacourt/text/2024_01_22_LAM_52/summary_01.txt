And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on Tywon White's motion to compel Sunlight Financial, LLC to comply with a deposition subpoena for production of business records. Sunlight objected to the subpoena on the basis that it sought personal records without providing written authorization or proof of service, but the judge found that this objection was unfounded because the records sought were not "personal records" within the meaning of the Code of Civil Procedure.

The judge granted White's motion to compel Sunlight to produce documents in response to categories Nos. 1-4, which demand agreements between Sunlight and certain parties related to the financing of photovoltaic systems. The judge also granted White's motion to compel Sunlight to produce documents in response to category No. 8, which demands records related to complaints about Entron Holding, Inc. doing business as Enerpower.

The judge ordered Sunlight to produce the demanded documents within 30 days, subject to a protective order proposed by White. The judge also ordered Sunlight to provide an affidavit in compliance with the Evidence Code within 30 days.
