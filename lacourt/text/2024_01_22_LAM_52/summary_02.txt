And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that Triller Hold Co LLC's motion to set aside its default is granted. The default was entered against Triller due to a mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. Specifically, Triller failed to update its contact information with Paracorp Inc., which resulted in the default. The judge finds that Triller's mistake is excusable and that the law favors disposing of cases on their merits. Therefore, the default is vacated and Triller is ordered to file its proposed responsive pleading forthwith.
