And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for terminating sanctions filed by Financial Credit Network, Inc. (Plaintiff) against Gildarda B. Martinez, et al. (Defendant). The Plaintiff had previously filed a motion for an order compelling Defendant to serve discovery responses and pay $290 in sanctions, which the court granted on October 11, 2024. Defendant failed to comply with the order and Plaintiff filed a motion for terminating sanctions. The motion is unopposed and the court has considered the totality of the circumstances, including Defendant's conduct and the detriment to Plaintiff. The court has determined that terminating sanctions are not warranted in this case, as Defendant has otherwise actively participated in the case and has made multiple appearances before the court. The court has denied Plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions.
