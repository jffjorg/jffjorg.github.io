 Case Number:  24NNCV00946    Hearing Date:   October 3, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER OVERRULING DEFENDANT'S DEMURRERI.        INTRODUCTION          This action arises out of Plaintiff Gulf Harbour
Investments Corporation’s (Plaintiff) purchase of a loan and interests in
property resulting in an inadvertent gap in the chain of assignment. On or
about June 4, 2002, Tom Larsen (Defendant) was granted an interest in the real
property located at 2180 Crawford Ave, Altadena, California, 91001. On or about
October 18, 2006, Indymac Bank, F.S.B. executed a note granting a loan to
Allison Murao and Defendant in connection with this property. Plaintiff subsequently
purchased the loan and interests in the note and deed of trust. After
commencing foreclosure proceedings on the property, Plaintiff noticed a gap in
the chain of title due to a failure to record Plaintiff’s title. On April 15, 2024, Plaintiff filed
a complaint with causes of action for an assignment of equitable lien and for
declaratory relief to resolve issues in the chain of title.
          On June 18, 2024, Defendant brought the instant demurrer alleging
that all causes of action fail to state a cause of action upon which relief can
be granted and are uncertain. To date, no opposition has been filed.
 
II.      LEGAL
STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 430.10(e) provides for a demurrer on the basis that
a complaint fails to state a cause of action. (Code Civ. Proc. 430.10 subd. (e).)
A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of a complaint. (Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  A demurrer is
treated as “admitting all material facts properly pleaded,” but not the truth
of “contentions, deductions or conclusions of law.” (Aubry v. Tri-Defendants
Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.) The general rule on demurrer
is that the pleadings are “deemed to be true, however improbable they may be.”
(Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.4th
593, 604.)¿ 
Questions
of plaintiff’s ability to prove unlikely allegations are of no concern. (Committee
on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197,
213-214.) Allegations need not be accepted as true if they are
contradicted by judicially noticeable facts. (Cansino v. Bank of America
(2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1474.)¿ 
Further,
“we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and
its parts in their context.” (Align Technology, Inc. v. Tran (2009) 179
Cal.App.4th 949, 958 [102 Cal.Rptr.3d 343].).) Because a demurrer tests only
the legal sufficiency of the pleading, we accept as true even the most
improbable alleged facts, and we do not concern ourselves with the plaintiff's
ability to prove its factual allegations. (Ibid.) ‘“Facts appearing in
exhibits attached to the [] complaint also are accepted as true and are given
precedence, to the extent they contradict the allegations.”’ (Paul v. Patton
(2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 1088, 1091.) 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 430.10(f) provides for a demurrer where a pleading
is uncertain. Demurrers for uncertainty are disfavored and are only sustained
where a pleading is so incomprehensible a defendant cannot reasonably respond.
(A.J. Fistes v. GDL Best Contractors, Inc. (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 677,
695; Khoury v. Maly’s of California (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612,
616.) 
“Even
as against a special demurrer, a plaintiff is required only to ‘set forth in
his complaint the essential facts of his case with reasonable precision and
with particularity sufficiently specific to acquaint the defendant of the
nature, source, and extent of his cause of action.’” (Elder v. Pac. Bell Tel. Co. (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 841, 858).
“[S]pecific dates and details . . . are properly addressed during discovery,
not on demurrer.” (People v. Highland
Fed. Sav. & Loan (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 1692, 1716).
 
III.     ANALYSIS
A.  
Meet and Confer Requirement
            Before filing a demurrer, the moving party must meet and confer in
person, by telephone, or by video conference with the party who filed the
pleading to attempt to reach an agreement that would resolve the objections to
the pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41.) A demurring party may file a
declaration “[t]hat the party who filed the pleading subject to demurrer failed
to respond to the meet and confer request of the demurring party or otherwise
failed to meet and confer in good faith.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd.
(a)(3)(B).) “Any determination by the court that the meet and confer process
was insufficient shall not be grounds to overrule or sustain a demurrer.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(4).)
          The meet and confer requirement has
been met. Defendant’s counsel declares he sent a letter to Plaintiff’s counsel
on May 10, 2024. (Alkana Decl., ¶ 2.) He also called Plaintiff’s counsel on May
15, 2024. (Alkana Decl., ¶ 2.) Defendant’s counsel received no response. (Alkana
Decl., ¶ 2.) 
B.   
Demurrer
First
Cause of Action
          Defendant demurs to the first cause of action
for failure to state facts sufficient to state a cause of action and for
uncertainty. 
“The
doctrine of equitable assignments is typically used to enforce
an attempted assignment of rights that is technically defective or to
create a right of subrogation.” (Recorded
Picture Co. v. Nelson Entertainment, Inc. (1967) 53 Cal.App.4th 350, 368, citations
omitted.) “[A]n ‘equitable assignment’ is still an ‘assignment.’ ‘To ‘assign’
ordinarily means to transfer title or ownership of property ..., but an
assignment, to be effective, must include manifestation to another person by
the owner of his intention to transfer the right, without further action, to
such other person or to a third person.... It is the substance and not
the form of a transaction which determines whether an assignment was
intended.... If from the entire transaction and the conduct of the parties it
clearly appears that the intent of the parties was to pass title to the
[property], then an assignment will be held to have taken place.” (Ibid.)
The court finds that Plaintiff provides
sufficient facts to state a cause of action. Here, Plaintiff
states it is entitled to an equitable assignment from Indymac Bank. (Complaint ¶ 19.) Plaintiff
states that it purchased the loan and interests in the note and deed of trust
to 2180 Crawford Ave, Altadena, California, 91001. (Complaint ¶ 11.) Plaintiff attached Defendant’s recorded
grant deed and Defendant’s loan documents with Indymac Bank. (Complaint, Exhs.
A-B.) Plaintiff states that it holds the original note, is the current payee
under the note, and is authorized to enforce the terms of the note and deed of trust.
(Complaint ¶ 11.) Further,
Plaintiff enforced the terms of its security interest by commencing foreclosure
proceedings on the property upon Defendant’s default. (Complaint ¶ 13-14.) Plaintiff learned about now defunct Indymac
Bank’s inadvertence, error, or unintentional omission in recording the
assignment when Plaintiff obtained the title report and found the gap in the
chain of title. (Complaint ¶ 17.) Although Plaintiff does not specify the
date or details of purchase, the court only concerns itself with the legal
sufficiency of the pleading in deciding a demurrer. (See Align Technology, Inc. v. Tran (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 949, 958.) Plaintiff therefore has pled
sufficient facts to allege that Indymac Bank attempted to assign the rights to
the property to Plaintiff but failed due to an issue in recording Plaintiff’s
title. 
Defendant argues that “[t]he Complaint fails
to attach any of the underlying documents upon which this action is predicated
that would demonstrate that Plaintiff is currently the lawful holder of the
note and/or deed of trust. To allege an equitable assignment, Plaintiff must
either attach a copy of the assignment to the Complaint or allege verbatim the
terms of the assignment.”  However, Defendant
offers no authority to support this argument. The Court notes that a complaint
need not set forth a detailed recitation of the evidence underlying a Plaintiff’s
allegations.  Nor does the law require
that a Plaintiff attach all documents upon which a cause of action is
based.  For example, in a breach of contract case, California law does
not require that a copy of the contract be attached to the complaint or pled
verbatim. (See Miles v. Deutsche Bank National Trust Company (2015) 236
Cal.App.4th 394, 401-402.)  The logical
extension of this rule is that Plaintiff in the present matter need not attach
the documents Defendant demands, nor quote from them verbatim. The court overrules the demurrer as to this cause of action.
Further, the
court does not find that Defendant has met the high standard to sustain a
demurrer on uncertainty grounds. Plaintiff provides the address of the property.
(Complaint ¶ 7.) Plaintiff states that it commenced
foreclosure proceedings against Defendant on this property. (Complaint ¶ 13.) Plaintiff alleges ownership of property interests. (Complaint ¶ 11.) Further, Plaintiff identifies itself, its attorneys, and its authority to do
business in the County of Los Angeles, California. (Complaint ¶ 1.) The complaint does not include all facts upon which this cause of
action is based, but is not incomprehensible. (See A.J. Fistes v. GDL Best Contractors, Inc. (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 677, 695.) A demurrer that is
missing dates and details is not uncertain because specific dates and details
are property addressed during discovery. (See People v. Highland Fed. Sav. & Loan (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 1692,
1716). Therefore, the court does not find that this
complaint fails based on uncertainty.
 
Second
Cause of Action
Defendant demurs to the second cause of action for
failure to state facts sufficient to state a cause of action and for
uncertainty.
“To
qualify for declaratory relief, a party would have to demonstrate its action
presented two essential elements: (1) a proper subject of declaratory relief,
and (2) an actual controversy involving justiciable questions relating to the
party’s rights or obligations.” (Jolley
v. Chase Home Finance, LLC (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 872, 909, quotation marks
and brackets omitted.)
Here,
Plaintiff provides sufficient facts to support a cause of action for
declaratory relief. Plaintiff seeks a judicial declaration that it holds a
valid interest in the note and Deed of Trust which is the senior lien on the
property and that it is entitled to an equitable assignment of the deed of trust. (Complaint ¶ 23.) Addressing the gap in the chain of title which
is missing a record of Plaintiff’s title is a proper subject of declaratory
relief. Additionally, whether Plaintiff holds a valid interest in the note and deed
of trust based on an assignment from Indymac Bank poses an actual controversy
involving justiciable questions relating to Plaintiff’s rights in the property.
Accordingly, the court finds that Plaintiff presents sufficient facts to meet
the two elements necessary for a cause of action for declaratory relief.
IV.     ORDER
          Defendant’s demurrer is overruled.
