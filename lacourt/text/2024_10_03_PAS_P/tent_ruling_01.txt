ORDER DENYING ATTORNEY JASON A. FEAZELL’S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATIONI.        INTRODUCTION
          This is a breach of contract
action arising from a settlement agreement (“Agreement”) between Defendant
Luanne Lihjy Chang (“Defendant” or “Chang”) and Jeanette Francis (“Francis”)
for Chang to make compensatory payments to Francis over a thirteen (13) year
period, and provided for Francis to assign the payments to her living trust
without approval from Chang.
          Plaintiff Gloria Hopper (“Plaintiff”),
as Trustee of the Francis Family Survivor’s Trust alleges on September 12,
2023, Francis assigned all of her interest/rights in the Agreement to the
Francis Family Survivor’s Trust. (Compl., ¶ BC-6.) Francis also provided for
Plaintiff to enforce the such rights under the Agreement. (Id.)
Plaintiff further alleges Chang failed to make the payments due 9/1/2023 and
10/1/23. (Compl., ¶BC-2.) Plaintiff further alleges she emailed a Written
Notice of Default and acceleration of payments to Chang’s attorney pursuant to
the Agreement. (Id.) Plaintiff also alleges she mailed a copy of the
Written Notice of Default and acceleration of payments to Chang and her
attorney. (Id.) Plaintiff also alleges Chang was given the right to cure
by 10/31/23 and failed to do so. (Id.) The remaining principal balance on
the Agreement is $950,000.00. (Compl., ¶BC-4.)
 
          On
February 7, 2024, Defendant Chang filed an Answer.
 
          On June 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories (Set One) and a Motion to
Compel Further Responses to Request for Admissions (Set One). The Court took
these matters under submission. 
 
On August 22, 2024, the Court granted both discovery
motions and ordered sanctions against Defendant Chang’s former counsel Jason A.
Feazell in the amount of $3,320.00 payable within 30 days. 
 
          On September 3, 2024, Jason A. Feazell
(“Feazell”) filed the instant Motion for Reconsideration of Court’s August 22,
2024. On September 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition. On September 25,
2024, Feazell filed a reply. 
 
II.      LEGAL
STANDARD
          Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 1008,
subdivision (a) provides that any party affected by an order of the Court “may,
within 10 days after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the
order and based upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make
application to the same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the
matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior order. The party making the
application shall state by affidavit what application was made before, when and
to what judge, what order or decisions were made, and what new or different
facts, circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (a).)
 
As
it relates to new or different facts, circumstances, or law under Code of Civil
P § 1008(a), “the moving party must provide a satisfactory explanation for the
failure to produce that evidence at an earlier time.” (Shiffer v. CBS Corp.
(2015) 240 Cal.App.4th 246, 255.) Furthermore, “facts of which the party
seeking reconsideration was aware at the time of the original ruling are not
“new or different.” (In re Marriage of Herr (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 1463,
1468.)
 
III.     ANALYSIS
          Defendant Chang’s former counsel of record, Jason A.
Feazell, moves for reconsideration of the Court’s August 22, 2024 order as to
the granting of sanctions in the amount of $3,320.00. As a preliminary matter,
the Court notes that Defendant Chang was not served with notice of the present
motion per the Proof of Service attached therein. Nevertheless, the Court will
exercise its discretion and rule on the merits. 
 
          Feazell contends he could not provide supplemental
responses to the propounded discovery or file an opposition to the discovery
motions on Defendant Chang’s behalf due to several matters that cannot be
explained without divulging any privileged or confidential information. Feazell
further contends it was these matters that led to him to substitute out of the
case. 
As
to the substitution of attorney, Feazell argues the substitution forms were
sent to Defendant Chang on June 24, 2024.  Feazell subsequently followed up with her
regarding either discovery responses and/or the signed substitution. Feazell
contends that after getting into contact with Defendant Chang, he re-sent the
substitution forms on July 24, 2024. Feazell asserts that Defendant Chang
electronically signed the substitution on July 31, 2024, which Feazell only
found out about on August 6, 2024 when he returned from being out of the
office. Finally, Feazell argues that he kept Plaintiff’s counsel apprised of
the situation at all times. 
          In opposition, Plaintiff argues the discovery motions were
filed on June 17, 2024, however, the Substitution of Attorney signed on June
24, 2024 was not filed until August 7, 2024. As such, Plaintiff contends
Feazell was fully aware the discovery motions were seeking sanctions against him
and Defendant Chang but filed no opposition to the discovery motions. Plaintiff
also contends the present motion fails because Feazell does not specify why any
purported new or different facts, law or circumstances could not have been
presented by him in opposition to the underlying discovery motions of which he
was fully aware. 
 
          The Court finds that Feazell fails to establish new or
different facts, circumstances, or law to support reconsideration of the
sanctions ordered in the August 22, 2024 order. First, Feazell was aware of the
filing of the underlying discovery motions including the sanctions sought
against him. Next, Feazell was aware of the fact that Defendant Chang had not
signed the substitution forms on June 24, 2024 but on July 31, 2024. Despite
Feazell’s awareness of these facts or circumstances, the present motion does
not indicate why he failed to present these facts to the Court at an earlier
time, such as at the August 22, 2024 hearing or even in opposition to the
underlying discovery motions. 
 
IV.     CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
          Based on the foregoing, The Court DENIES Attorney Jason A.
Feazell’s Motion for Reconsideration of the Court’s August 22, 2024 Order. 
          Attorney Jason A. Feazell is ordered to give notice of this
order.
