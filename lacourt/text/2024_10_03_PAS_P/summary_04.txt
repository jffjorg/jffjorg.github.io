And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to bifurcate the trial into two phases. The first phase will determine liability, compensatory damages, and whether the defendant (Akop Torosian) was guilty of malice. The second phase will determine the amount of punitive damages. The judge has also granted a protective order prohibiting any counsel or witness from mentioning or disclosing Akop's financial status until the second phase of trial. The judge has based this ruling on California Civil Code, Section 3295, which provides that a court may grant a protective order requiring the plaintiff to produce evidence of a prima facie case of liability for damages prior to the introduction of evidence of the defendant's profits or financial condition. The judge has found that there is good cause to issue a protective order because the causes of action do not require evidence of Akop's financial condition or profits, and the evidence may prejudice the jury.
