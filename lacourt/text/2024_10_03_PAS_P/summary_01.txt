And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Attorney Jason A. Feazell's motion for reconsideration of the order granting sanctions against him and his client, Luanne Lihjy Chang. The motion was filed on September 3, 2024, and the judge ruled that Feazell failed to establish new or different facts, circumstances, or law to support reconsideration of the order. The judge noted that Feazell was aware of the discovery motions and the sanctions sought against him, but failed to present the necessary information to the court at an earlier time. The judge also found that Feazell's excuse for not providing supplemental responses to the discovery requests and for not filing an opposition to the discovery motions was not satisfactory. The judge ordered Feazell to give notice of this order.
