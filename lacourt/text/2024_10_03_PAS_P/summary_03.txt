And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendant, Tom Larsen, in a case brought by Gulf Harbour Investments Corporation (Plaintiff). The Plaintiff purchased a loan and interests in a property from Indymac Bank, but discovered a gap in the chain of title due to a failure to record the Plaintiff's title. The Plaintiff filed a complaint with causes of action for an assignment of equitable lien and for declaratory relief.

The judge finds that the Plaintiff has pled sufficient facts to state a cause of action for an equitable assignment, and that the demurrer is overruled. The judge also finds that the complaint is not uncertain, as it provides sufficient information about the property and the parties involved.

The judge notes that a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of a pleading, and that a complaint need not set forth a detailed recitation of the evidence underlying a plaintiff's allegations. The judge also notes that a plaintiff need not attach all documents upon which a cause of action is based.

The judge further finds that the second cause of action for declaratory relief is also pled with sufficient facts to meet the two elements necessary for a cause of action for declaratory relief. The judge orders that the demurrer is overruled, and that the Plaintiff is to give notice of this ruling.
