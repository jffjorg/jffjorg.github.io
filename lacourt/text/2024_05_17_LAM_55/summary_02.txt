And here is the English text summary of the tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion for attorney fees and costs in the amount of $88,635.50. The defendants, represented by DLA PIPER LLP, had brought a motion to strike the plaintiff's complaint under Code Civ. Proc. section 425.16, which was granted by the court. The defendants are now seeking attorney fees and costs associated with the motion. The court has reviewed the time entries submitted by the defendants and finds that the amounts requested are reasonable. The court also finds that the defendant's counsel's hourly rates are commensurate with their experience and skill levels. The plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that the fees are unreasonable and that the defendant's counsel should have provided invoices. The court disagrees with these arguments and finds that the defendant's counsel has spent reasonable time and effort on the matter.
