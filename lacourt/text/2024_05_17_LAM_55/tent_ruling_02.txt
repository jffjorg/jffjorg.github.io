 Case Number:  23STCV18257    Hearing Date:   May 17, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:
Defendants’ Motion for Attorney Fees
BACKGROUND
PATRIZIO MOI (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendants
DLA PIPER LLP (US); DLA Piper attorneys MILES COOLEY; MICHAEL GARFINKEL; JASON LUEDDEKE;
and MICHAEL BROWN (collectively “Moving Defendants”); JABARI’s INC.; JABARI
MCDAVID (“McDavid,” Jabari Inc.’s owner); and PHILIP LAWRENCE in connection
with a lawsuit (“Lawsuit 1”) filed by Plaintiff and Jabari’s Inc. against
Lawrence and Moving Defendants’ representation of Lawrence in that lawsuit. 
Moving Defendants previously brought a motion to
strike under Code Civ. Proc. section 425.16, which extends protections to strategic
lawsuits against public participation (“SLAPP” actions). On 1/31/24, the Court
issued an order striking the entire Complaint as to Moving Defendants. Moving Defendants
now move for an award of mandatory attorneys’ fees under Code Civ. Proc. section
425.16(c) in the amount of $86,400.50 and costs in the amount of $2,235.00, for
a total claimed amount of $88,635.50. Plaintiff opposes the motion.  
LEGAL STANDARD
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16(c), a
prevailing defendant is entitled to recover attorney’s fees and costs
associated with the motion. A defendant may only recover fees and costs related
to the motion to strike. Lafayette Morehouse, Inc. v. Chronicle Publishing
Co. (1995) 39 Cal. App. 4th 1379, 1383. This includes fees associated with
bringing the motion for fees. Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal. 4th 1122,
1141.  
ANALYSIS
Plaintiff argues Moving Defendants are not entitled to
the fees sought because the motion contains duplicative or unnecessary billing entries
and block-billing entries, contains errors, does not attach the invoices, and
does not establish the reasonableness of the fees sought. (Opp. 4:16-28;
5:1-26; 6:1-23; 7:1-27; 8:1-27; 9:9-28;10:1-28; 11:1-28; 12:1-23; 13:1-28;
14:1-5.) The Court disagrees.  The Court
has conducted its own review of the time entries submitted in Exhibit E to the
moving papers, which are summarized in the Declaration of Leah Plaskin Lorenz.
The Court finds that the amounts requested for the anti-SLAPP motion are
reasonable. As described in the supplemental declaration filed with the reply, the
minor error in calculating the number of hours in one category of work results
in Moving Defendants seeking 1.7 hours less in fees than they are entitled to recover,
hardly a reason to find the overall fees unreasonable. Plaintiff provides no
case or statutory law that requires an attorneys’ fee motion be accompanied by
invoices, and indeed, invoices are not required. 
The hourly rates for Moving Defendants’ counsel are
commensurate with their counsels’ respective experience and skill levels and in
the Los Angeles legal community. Plaintiff does not dispute that the hourly
rates are reasonable. 
This was a complex matter that required counsel for
the Moving Defendants to research the facts and legal claims in Lawsuit 1 and
draft an anti-SLAPP motion analyzing both steps of the anti-SLAPP statute as they
pertained to the claims in this case involving Lawsuit 1. The Court agrees with
Moving Defendants that Plaintiff multiplied Moving Defendants’ legal fees by filing
unauthorized supplemental filings after Moving Defendants had filed their reply
for the anti-SLAPP motion and then attempting to dismiss his case prior to the
Court’s ruling on the anti-SLAPP motion. Those actions by Plaintiff necessitated
additional research and filings by counsel for moving Defendants. Moving
Defendants estimate that their attorneys will spend approximately eight
additional hours briefing the fees motion, which the Court finds reasonable. 
Finally, Plaintiff argues he is not liable for Moving
Defendants’ fees because his Complaint was filed in good faith and was not
frivolous. (Opp. 14:6-27; 15:1-21.) But Code of Civil Proc. section 425.16(c)
mandates the award of fees and costs to a prevailing defendant on an anti-SLAPP
motion. Whether or not Plaintiff filed his case in good faith has no bearing on
the fee analysis. 
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, the Court grants Defendants
Miles Michael Cooley, Michael Brian Garfinkel, Jason Taylor Lueddeke, Michael
Patrick Brown, and DLA Piper LLP’s motion for attorneys’ fees and costs in the
amount of $88,635.50.
