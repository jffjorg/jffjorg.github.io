Background
 
on
April 27, 2021, Jose Correa and Veronica Correa (“Plaintiffs”) filed a
Complaint against SO Group Realty, LLC; Star Parking Management, Inc. (“Star
Parking”); and Does 1 to 100. The Complaint alleges six causes of action: (1)
Negligence, (2) Negligence Premises Liability, (3) Strict
Products Liability: Manufacturing Defect; (4) Strict Products Liability:
Design Defect; (5) Strict Products Liability: Failure to Warn; and (6) Loss of
Consortium. 
 
This action relates to an
incident that occurred on June 6, 2019, when a heavy gate fell on Plaintiff
Jose Correa, hitting him on the head and body. 
The gate was part of a parking structure located on the corner of West
12th Street and Hope Street (the “Premises”) in the County of Los Angeles. 
 
On August 23, 2021, Plaintiffs
dismissed SO Group Realty, LLC as a Defendant. In January 2022, Plaintiffs
added Montgomery Management Company; The Estate of Francis J. Montgomery; Francis J. Montgomery, individually and as Trustee of the
Francis J. Montgomery Living Trust, dated November 24, 1993; and Maria V.
Montgomery, individually, and as Trustee of the MVM Evergreen Trust, dated
March 19, 2016, as Defendants. 
 
On December 12, 2023,
Defendants the Montgomery Management Company (“Montgomery management”); the
Estate of Francis J. Montgomery (the “Estate”);
Francis J. Montgomery individually and as Trustee of the Francis J. Montgomery
Trust Dated November 24, 1993 (“FJM”); Maria V. Mongomery, individually and as
Trustee the MVM Evergreen Trust, dated March 19, 2016 (“MVM”), filed a
Cross-Complaint against Cross-Defendants Star Parking. 
 
The Cross-Complaint
alleges six causes of action: (1) Breach of Contract, (2) Express
Indemnification, (3) Implied Indemnity, (4) Comparative Contribution, (5) Total
Equitable Indemnity, and (6) Declaratory Relief. 
 
On January 11,
2024, Cross-Defendant Star Parking filed a demurrer to the first and second
causes of action of the Cross-Complaint. Cross-Complainants oppose the
demurrer. The matter is now before the court. 
 
Discussion
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
Where pleadings are defective, a party may raise the defect
by way of a demurrer. (Coyne v. Krempels (1950) 36 Cal.2d 257, 262.) A
demurrer tests the sufficiency of a pleading, and the grounds for a demurrer
must appear on the face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable matters.¿
(CCP § 430.30(a); Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) In
evaluating a demurrer, the court accepts the complainant’s properly pled facts
as true and ignores contentions, deductions, and conclusory statements. (Daar
v. Yellow Cab Co. (1976) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713; Serrano v. Priest (1971)
5 Cal.3d 584, 591.) Moreover, the court does not consider whether a plaintiff
will be able to prove the allegations or the possible difficulty in making such
proof. (Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d
590, 604.) 
Leave to amend must be allowed where
there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿ The burden is on the complainant to
show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.)
 
II.        Demurrer[1]
 
Cross-Defendant Star Parking demurs to
the first and second causes of action on the grounds that the Contract between
the parties is only between Star Parking and Montgomery Management and not the
remaining Cross-Defendants. 
 
A.        Breach of Contract and Express
Indemnification
 
The elements of a
claim for breach of contract are: “(1) the existence of the contract, (2)
plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant's breach,
and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff.” (Oasis West Realty, LLC v.
Goldman (2011) 51 Cal. 4th 811, 821.) In addition, the complaint must
demonstrate damages proximately caused by the breach. (St. Paul Ins. v.
American Dynasty (2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 1038, 1060.)
 
“If the
action is based on alleged breach of written contract, the terms must be set
out verbatim in the body of the complaint or a copy of the written agreement
must be attached and incorporated by reference.” (Harris
v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999) 74
Cal.App.4th 299, 308.) Alternatively, “a plaintiff may plead the legal effect
of the contract rather than its precise language.”¿ (Construction Protective
Services, Inc. v. TIG Specialty Ins. Co. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 189,
198-199.)¿¿“[A]ll essential elements of a breach of contract cause of action []
must be pleaded with specificity.”¿(Levy v. State Farm Mutual Automobile
Ins. Co. (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 1, 5.) 
 
“Indemnity
is a contract by which one engages to save another from a legal consequence of
the conduct of one parties, or of some other person” (Civ. Code, § 2772.)
Parties to an indemnity contract have great freedom of action in allocating
risk, subject to limitations of public policy.  (See Peter Culley &
Associates v. Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1484, 1492 [parties may
require negligence by the indemnitor as a condition to indemnification]; Continental
Heller Corp. v. Amtech Mechanical Services, Inc. (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 500,
505 [parties may establish a duty in the indemnitor to save the indemnitee
harmless even if the indemnitor is not negligent].)  
 
The Cross-Complaint
includes a 20-page document entitled “Standard Industrial/Commercial
Single-Tenant Lease – Net.” (CC Ex. A.) Cross-Defendants assert that the
contract is only 
between Montgomery
Management as “Lessor” and Star Parking as “Lessee” (CC Ex. A, § 1.1.) The
Addendum to Lease asserts that Montgomery Management is not the owner of the
Premises but acts as property manager and may at its option “require Lessee to
name the owners of the Premise as additional insureds on any insurance
policies.” (CC Ex. A, Addendum to Lease.)
 
Cross-Defendants
point out that the contract makes no mention of the Estate, FJM or MVM being
parties to the contract. There are no allegations in the Cross-Complaint that
the Estate, FJM or MVM are the owners of the Premises, or that Montgomery
Management exercised the option of requiring Star Company to add the Estate and
FJM and MVM under the insurance policy. (See Schick v. Lerner (1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 1321, 1327 [“facts not alleged are presumed
not to exist”].)
 
Based on the above,
the court agrees that Cross-Complaint fails to state a viable claim for
breach of contract and express indemnity. Accordingly, the demurrer is
sustained with leave to amend. 
 
Conclusion
 
Cross-Defendant Star Parking’s
demurrer to the first and second causes of action in the Cross-Complaint are
sustained with leave to amend. Cross-Complaints are granted 30 days leave to
amend. The court sets the OSC RE: Amended Cross-Complaint for May 16, 2024, at
8:30 a.m. Moving Party to give notice.
