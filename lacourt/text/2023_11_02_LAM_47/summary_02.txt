And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for discovery of probation officer personnel records, subject to certain limitations. The court has set an in-camera hearing for December 7, 2023, to review the records and determine their discoverability. The court has ordered the parties to meet and confer regarding a joint stipulation to a protective order, which will govern the use and disclosure of the records. The protective order will ensure that the records are not used for any purpose other than a court proceeding, and that private personal information is redacted. The court has also ordered the parties to file a privilege log, identifying any materials that are subject to the attorney-client privilege or work product doctrine.
