And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion to seal portions of the motion for determination of good faith settlement. The case involves a breach of fiduciary duty arising from the alleged mismanagement of commercial real property. The plaintiff and some defendants entered into a settlement agreement on July 25, 2024, with a confidentiality clause. The plaintiff is seeking to seal the settlement terms and amounts to protect their financial privacy.

The judge finds that the plaintiff has identified a compelling interest to support redacting the settlement terms and amounts, namely to protect their financial privacy. The court must balance the plaintiff's interest in privacy against the public's interest in access to court records. The judge concludes that the proposed order is narrowly tailored to serve the plaintiff's privacy interests and that there are no less restrictive means of protecting that interest.

Consequently, the judge grants the plaintiff's motion to seal portions of the motion for determination of good faith settlement.
