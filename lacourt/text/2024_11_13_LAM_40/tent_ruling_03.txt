[TENTATIVE] ORDER 
TAKING OFF CALENDAR DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO ENFORCE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT 
 
      This
action arises from Defendants’ alleged trespass onto Plaintiff’s property. The
parties entered into a settlement agreement on May 9, 2024. Defendants contend
they have satisfied their obligations under the agreement. The parties agreed
to cooperate in attempting to seal a portion of the record, however sealing the
record was not a material term. Therefore, Defendants assert that the action
should be dismissed. 
      The
proof of service attached to the motion is incomplete as it does not identify
the parties that were served with the motion. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1013a.) Accordingly, the motion is taken off calendar.
