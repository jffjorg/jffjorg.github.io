And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Victoria Stodden v. William Weinstein, et al., taking off calendar the defendants' motion to enforce a settlement agreement. The case arose from the defendants' alleged trespass onto the plaintiff's property, and the parties entered into a settlement agreement on May 9, 2024. However, the motion is incomplete because the proof of service attached to it does not identify the parties that were served. As a result, the judge has decided to take the motion off calendar, pending further completion of the proof of service.
