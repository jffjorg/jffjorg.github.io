And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a sexual assault case filed by T.M. against Whittier City School District. T.M. alleges that she was sexually assaulted by her 8th grade math teacher, Jason Kreuger, in 2005 while she was a student at Walter Dexter Middle School. The District opposes T.M.'s motions to compel further responses to requests for production and special interrogatories, arguing that they are overbroad and would violate the privacy of students. The Judge finds that the public interest in disclosure outweighs the privacy interests of third parties, but also finds that the requests are overbroad. The Judge grants the motions in part, ordering the District to produce documents and further responses limited to the one year that T.M. attended the school. The Judge also orders that a protective order be entered to govern the disclosure of confidential documents produced or to be produced throughout the course of discovery.
