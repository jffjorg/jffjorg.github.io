And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motions to compel depositions of Michael E. Gibson and Jon Niederbrach, and denied the motions to compel sanctions. The judge also granted the motion to continue the hearing for the motion for summary judgment. The judge ruled that the amended complaint filed by the plaintiff moots the motion for summary judgment, and therefore placed the motion off-calendar. The judge ordered the defendant to produce Jon Niederbrach and Michael Gibson for depositions by a certain date. The judge noted that there is a motion to continue trial scheduled for September 20, 2024, and that there are other motions scheduled to occur after the currently scheduled trial date.
