And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is to place both the Defendant's Motion to Compel Further Responses to Deposition Questions and the Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Further Responses to Request for Production of Documents off-calendar. The judge notes that the parties have not been able to resolve their disputes despite multiple continuances and instructions to meet and confer. The judge's order also reminds the parties that they are required to submit a joint statement outlining any remaining disputed issues by a certain date, but as of the current date, no joint statement has been filed. The judge's ruling is intended to give the parties an opportunity to resolve their disputes informally, but if they are unable to do so, the matter will be heard on the scheduled date.
