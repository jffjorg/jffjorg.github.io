Motion for Summary Judgment/Ex Parte Application to Continue Motion
 
This action concerning real property was filed by Plaintiff
THE PACIFIC SOUTHWEST DISTRICT OF THE LUTHERAN CHURCH – MISSOURI SYNOD
(“Plaintiff”) on April 26, 2022.  
 
The subject Motion for Summary Judgment/Adjudication was
filed on July 5, 2024. A First Amended Memorandum of Points and Authorities in
Support of Motion for Summary Judgment or in the alternative Summary
Adjudication was filed on July 17, 2024. Defendant/Cross-Complainant PEACE
LUTHERAN CHURCH INCORPORATED, OF SOUTH GATE, CALIFORNIA (“PLC”) moves for
summary judgment/adjudication against Plaintiff’s Complaint and all causes of
action contained therein. 
 
On July 31, 2024, this Court GRANTED Plaintiff’s Motion for
Leave to File a First Amended Complaint. Consequently, the operative First
Amended Complaint (“FAC”) was FILED on August 5, 2024. 
 
The FAC filed on August 5, 2024 is the operative pleading,
and moots the
subject Motion directed toward the original Complaint. “It is well established
that an amendatory pleading supersedes the original one, which ceases to
perform any function as a pleading.” (Foreman & Clark Corp. v. Fallon
(1971) 3 Cal.3d 875, 884.) Thus, an amended complaint supersedes all prior
complaints. (Grell v. Laci Le Beau Corp. (1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 1300,
1307.) “The amended complaint furnishes the sole basis for the cause of action
and the original complaint ceases to have any effect either as a pleading or as
a basis for judgment. [Cite]” (State Compensation Ins. Fund. v. Superior
Court (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1124, 1130-1131.) “Because there is but one
complaint in a civil action, the filing of an amended complaint moots a motion
directed to a prior complaint. Thus, once an amended complaint is filed, it is
error to grant summary adjudication on a cause of action contained in a
previous complaint. [Internal Citations Omitted.]” (Id.) 
 
The Motion is placed OFF-CALENDAR as MOOT. 
 
For the reasons stated above, Defendant/Cross-Complainant PLC’s ex parte
application to continue the motion for summary judgment/summary adjudication is
placed OFF-CALENDAR as MOOT.  
 
Motions to Compel Depositions 
 
Defendant/Cross-Complainant PLC moves to compel
the depositions of (1) Party Employee MICHAEL E. GIBSON as the President of The
Pacific Southwest District of the Lutheran Church – Missouri Synod (“PSWD”);
and (2) Party Employee JON NIEDERBRACH as the Chief Operating Officer of PSWD.
PLC argues that the depositions of both Jon Niederbrach and Michael Gibson were
properly noticed. PSWD failed to produce Jon Niederbrach for his properly
noticed deposition date of June 13, 2024, and failed to produce Michael Gibson
for his properly noticed deposition date of June 14, 2024. 
 
In Opposition(s), PSWD argues: (1) the Notice of Taking Deposition of
Jon Niederbrach was defective and that PSWD was within its rights to end the
deposition because the court reporter provided by PLC was not certified; and
(2) a valid objection to the Notice of Taking Deposition of Michael Gibson was
issued because counsel was unavailable due to a medical emergency. 
 
A party may obtain discovery by taking oral depositions. (CCP
§2025.010.) CCP §2025.450, which governs motions to compel deposition, provides
that “[i]f, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an
officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person
designated by an organization that is a party…without having served a valid
objection under §2025.410, fails to appear for examination…the party giving the
notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and
testimony.” (CCP §2025.450(a).) “Unless the parties agree or the court orders
otherwise, the testimony, as well as any stated objections, shall be taken
stenographically. If taken stenographically, it shall be by a person
certified….” (CCP §2025.330(b).) 
 
In both Oppositions, PSWD argues that both Motions are unnecessary and
could have been informally resolved if PLC had engaged in good faith meet and
confer efforts to reschedule the depositions. PSWD indicates that they are willing
to reschedule and produce both Mr. Gibson and Mr. Niederbrach. 
 
The Motions are GRANTED. PLC is entitled to take PSWD’s employee’s
depositions, and PSWD does not substantively oppose producing either Mr.
Niederbrach or Mr. Gibson for depositions. 
 
If [the] motion is granted, the court shall impose a monetary
sanction…in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against the
deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (CCP
§2025.450(g)(2).) 
 
It is undisputed that the court reporter hired for
PLC for the deposition of Jon Niederbrach was not certified. Moreover, PSWD
served an Objection to the Deposition Notice of Michael Gibson because Counsel
was unavailable on the dates noticed due to a scheduled medical procedure. 
 
Sanctions are
DENIED. 
 
Trial is currently
scheduled for October 15, 2024. The Court notes that there is a Motion to
Continue Trial scheduled for September 20, 2024, and that there are a number of
Motions scheduled to occur after the currently scheduled trial date. PSWD is
ORDERED to produce Jon Niederbrach and Michael Gibson to appear for depositions
by no later than 15 calendar days from the date of the issuance of this Order.
The date may be extended by agreement of the parties.
