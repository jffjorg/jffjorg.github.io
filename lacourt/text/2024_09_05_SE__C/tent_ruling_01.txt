Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Deposition Questions 
 
Defendant HANNAH SEUING EUN AHN moves to compel further

deposition questions at issue. Plaintiff Kim seemingly refused to answer many
of the subject questions citing privacy objections/concerns. 
 
This
matter was initially set for hearing on April 11, 2024, but continued to April
25, 2024 to enable Defendant the opportunity to respond to, and this Court to
adequately review, Plaintiff’s untimely filed Opposition papers. 
On
April 25, 2024, this Court continued the Motion for a second time and ordered
the parties to meet and confer, and file a Joint Statement outlining any
disputed issues by no later than Monday, June 3, 2024. 
 
An
untimely Joint Statement was filed on June 7, 2024. The untimely Joint
Statement indicates “the parties have not had an opportunity to further meet
and confer.” (JS 2:14.) 
 
On
June 13, 2024, this matter was CONTINUED again. Counsel were, once again,
instructed to further meet and confer on the issues outlined in the subject
Motions. The following Order was issued: “Counsel are ORDERED to make further efforts to resolve the issues presented.
If, after exhausting those efforts, court intervention is needed, counsel may
appear and argue the merits on the continued hearing date. If counsel are
unable to informally resolve their discovery disputes, then counsel are
instructed to submit a JOINT STATEMENT outlining the remaining disputed
issues for which a ruling is required. The joint statement must be FILED on or
before Monday, August 26, 2024.” (06/13/24, M.O.)
 
As
of September 3, 2024, no Joint Statement has been filed/lodged with this Court.

 
The
matter is placed OFF-CALENDAR. 
 
Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Request for Production of Documents 
 
The
Opposition to this Motion was originally due by May 31, 2024. Without leave of
Court, Defendant filed an untimely Opposition on June 3, 2024. As of June 11,
2024, no Reply had been filed. 
 
On
June 13, 2024, this matter was CONTINUED to September 5, 2024 to ensure that
Plaintiff had the ability to review and respond to Defendant’s untimely
Opposition. Plaintiff was given the opportunity to file and serve a Reply per
Code in accordance with this hearing date. 
 
Additionally,
the parties were ORDERED to submit a Joint Statement. The following Order was
issued: “Counsel are ORDERED to make
further efforts to resolve the issues presented. If, after exhausting those
efforts, court intervention is needed, counsel may appear and argue the merits
on the continued hearing date. If counsel are unable to informally resolve
their discovery disputes, then counsel are instructed to submit a JOINT
STATEMENT outlining the remaining disputed issues for which a ruling is
required. The joint statement must be FILED on or before Monday, August 26,
2024.” (06/13/24, M.O.)
