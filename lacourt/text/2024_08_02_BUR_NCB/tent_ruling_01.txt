Case
  No.: 22BBCV01171
 
  Hearing Date:  August 2, 2024
 
 [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
motions to compel discovery responses; requests for sanctions
 



 
On May 31, 2024,
Defendant David Harris (“Defendant”) filed 3 motions to compel initial responses
from Plaintiffs Allan Lotta and Terezia Korossy (“Plaintiffs”) for: (1) Form
Interrogatories (“FROG”), set one; (2) Special Interrogatories (“SROG”), set
one; and (3) Request for Production of Documents (“RPD”), set one.  
On January 18, 2024,
Defendant served on Plaintiffs the discovery requests.  Plaintiffs’ counsel requested and Defendant granted
three extensions such that responses were due by April 23, 2024.  Defense counsel then unilaterally granted
Plaintiffs two more extensions such that responses were due by May 22,
2024.  As of the filing of the motions, Defendant
states that he has not received responses from Plaintiffs.  
Defendant’s unopposed
motions to compel responses to the FROG, SROG, and RPD are granted pursuant to
CCP §§ 2030.290 and 2031.300.  Plaintiffs
are ordered to provide verified responses to Defendant’s
discovery requests, without
objections, within 20 days of notice of this order.  
Defendant
requests sanctions against Plaintiffs and their attorney in the amount of
$455.34 for each motion (= [2 hours to meet and confer, prepare motion, and
attend hearing at $160.17/hour] + [1 hour of legal assistant time to reserve
the motion at $75/hour] + [$60 filing fee].  The requests are granted in the total amount
of $450 for a reasonable amount of attorney’s fees spent on the 3 relatively
simple and identical motions, plus $180 in filing fees.  Plaintiffs and their counsel of record, jointly and severally, are ordered to
pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $630 to Defendant, by and through
counsel, within 20 days of notice of this order. 
Defendant shall provide
notice of this order.
