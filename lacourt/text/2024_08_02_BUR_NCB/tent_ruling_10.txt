motions to strike
 



            
BACKGROUND 
A.   
Allegations 
Plaintiffs William Yao and Ailin Yao
(“Plaintiffs”) allege that Mr. Yao is a quadriplegic who relies on a wheelchair
for mobility and his wife, Mrs. Yao, is his caretaker.  Plaintiffs allege that in June 2018, they purchased
unit 302 in the Vita Bella complex located at 12050 Geurin Street in Studio
City.  Plaintiffs allege that Defendant
Vita Bella Homeowners Association (“VB HOA”) and Defendant Coro Community
Management and Consulting, LLC (“CCMC”) own, operate, and/or manage the housing
and related facilities, services, and support provided by and through Vita
Bella. 
Plaintiffs allege that in June 2018, they
applied to install wood flooring in the unit to accommodate Mr. Yao’s
wheelchair.  They allege that they spoke
with then-president of the VB HOA Board Jennie Brandt, who directed them to
contact CCMC.  CCMC’s executive director
Russell Benjamin informed Mrs. Yao that underlayment of the flooring would need
to be approved and directed Plaintiffs to provide specifications to contractor
LA Acoustic Services (“LAAS”).  In July
2018, demolition and installation of the hardwood flooring (overseen by Ms.
Brandt) was underway and installation of the hardwood flooring was completed on
August 2, 2018.  Plaintiffs allege that
they began preparing to move into their unit. 
Plaintiffs allege that in order for Mr.
Yao to use the parking facilities at the complex, he needed a parking space
that was configured for use by a person with a disability who uses a
wheelchair.  They allege that the only
available spot was a guest parking spot, but this was not large enough to fit
Plaintiffs’ SUV.  They allege that
because the parking space was insufficient to accommodate Mr. Yao’s disability,
they were unable to move into the unit as planned.  Plaintiffs allege that the CC&Rs
prohibited Plaintiffs from leasing their unit for 8 months following the close
of escrow, so the unit remained vacant until July 2019, and then their daughter
Olivia Yao moved into the unit from July 2019 to May 2021.  
Plaintiffs allege that they emailed Gail
Bank of the HOA Board about wheelchair accessible parking spaces on July 15,
2020, but were informed that the handicapped space belonged to another unit
owner.  Mr. Yao opened a complaint with
the Department of Fair Housing and Employment on September 11, 2020, alleging
that Defendants failed to reasonably accommodate his request for accessible
parking, but the DFEH issued a “No Cause Determination” on July 22, 2021.  Mr. Yao then appealed the decision and on
September 1, 2021, the DFEH upheld its determination.  
In July 2021, Plaintiffs decided to put up
their unit for sale.  On July 12, 2021,
Victor Sahn on behalf of the HOA contacted Plaintiffs’ listing agent to inform
him that the unit was in violation of the CC&Rs because of the hardwood
flooring and that Plaintiffs’ daughters had been living in the unit instead of
Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs allege that from
July 2021 to January 5, 2022, they lost offers from 3 separate buyers due to
Defendants’ demand to disclose their ongoing dispute with the HOA and
non-compliance with the CC&Rs.  In
January 2022, they received and accepted their fourth offer, which Defendants
again obstructed.  
The second amended complaint (“SAC”),
filed May 2, 2024, alleges causes of action for: (1) the Fair Housing
Amendments Act of 1982, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq.; (2) California Fair
Employment and Housing Act, Gov’t Code, § 12955 et seq.; (3) California
Unruh Civil Rights Act, Civ. Code, § 51 et seq.; (4) California Disabled
Persons Act, Civ. Code, § 54.1 et seq.; and (5) negligence, Civ. Code, §
1714.

DISCUSSION RE
CCMC’S MOTION TO STRIKE
A.    Request for Judicial Notice
CCMC requests
that the Court take judicial notice of Exhibits: (1) a letter from the
Department of Housing and Urban Development (“DHUD”) dated May 14, 2022; (2)
Plaintiffs’ DFEH complaint dated May 25, 2021; and (3) DFEH’s Notice of Case
Closure dated August 2, 2021.  The Court
notes that no documents are attached to the request for judicial notice filing
or the motion to strike papers.  As the
documents are not provided, the Court declines to take judicial notice of
purported Exhibits 1 to 3.  
Plaintiffs
request judicial notice of Exhibits: (A) email communications with DHUD dated September
11, 2020, October 12, 2020, October 15, 2020, October 19, 2020, and November 5,
2020; (B) DHUD’s letter dated May 14, 2022 (the request for judicial notice
states the date is 2021); (C) DFEH’s No Cause Determination Letter dated July
22, 2021; and (D) DFEH’s letter re: response to appeal dated September 1, 2021.  The request is granted.  (Evid. Code, § 452(c).) 
B.     Merits of the Motion to Strike 
CCMC moves to
strike false, time-barred claims, and allegations for punitive damages from the
SAC at paragraphs 34, 41 (lines 9-10), 42, 45, 48, 49, 51 (lines 10-12), 52,
53, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 102, 107b, 107d, 108 (lines 25-28), 109 (lines
2-5), 120b, 120c, 120f, 128, and 132, and the prayer for damages at item 2. 
First, CCMC
argues that contrary to Plaintiffs’ allegations that they filed their DHUD
complaint on September 11, 2020, the judicially noticeable documents show that
Plaintiffs filed their complaint with DHUD on September 11, 2021.  As stated above, CCMC has not provided any
exhibits attached to its request for judicial notice.  However, it appears that Plaintiffs have
attached the same documents with their request for judicial notice.  A review of the May 14, 2022 letter shows
that DHUD acknowledged receiving her complaint on September 11, 2020.  (Pl.’s RJN, Ex. B.)  This is consistent with Plaintiffs’
allegations in the SAC.  
CCMC also argues
that Plaintiffs filed their DFEH complaint on May 25, 2021, and their case
number was “202105-13681826.”  CCMC
argues that the use of “202105” by the DFEH shows that the complaint was filed
in May 2021 and that this reasoning applied to DHUD’s case number of
“09-21-5531-8” would mean that the DHUD complaint was actually filed on
September 11, 2021 and not the year 2020.  However, the Court will not make this
inferential leap based on file numbers. 
If CCMC wants to prove this with declarations from employees or experts
regarding DHUD/DFEH at the time that evidence may be submitted at the summary
judgment or trial stage, it may do so; however, at the pleading stage, the
Court will accept the allegations of the SAC as true.  The motion to strike paragraphs 56 and 57 is
denied.
Second, CCMC
argues that Plaintiffs’ claims regarding the alleged parking accommodations are
barred by the relevant statute of limitations. 
CCMC argues that taking into account the 2-year statute of limitations
period for FEHA claims (Gov’t Code, § 12989.1) and 50-day tolling from August
12, 2020 to October 1, 2020 (based on Emergency Rule 9’s tolling from April 6,
2020 through October 1, 2020), Plaintiffs had until January 4, 2023 to file
their complaint based on Plaintiffs’ last alleged date of discrimination on
August 12, 2020.  (SAC, ¶53.)  CCMC argues that the complaint was untimely
filed on August 30, 2023, such that Plaintiffs’ 1st, 2nd,
and 3rd causes of action are time-barred.  
In opposition,
Plaintiffs argue that the last act of discrimination for Defendants’ first failure
to accommodate Plaintiffs was on August 12, 2020, when Defendants denied
Plaintiffs’ first request for a reasonable accommodation.  (SAC, ¶¶52, 53.)  Plaintiffs argue that because this was during
the Emergency Rule 9 tolling period, the statute did not begin to run.  They argue that they opened their
administrative complaint on September 11, 2020, which then tolled the statute
of limitations period to September 1, 2021, when the administrative appeal
closed.  (Id., ¶¶56-60; Pl.’s RJN,
Ex. D.)  Thus, Plaintiffs argue that they
had until September 1, 2023 to file their complaint.  Plaintiffs also argue that the second
failure to accommodate occurred on January 5, 2022, such that they had until
January 5, 2024 to file the action. 
(SAC, ¶¶89-90.)  
Based on the timeline of events alleged in the SAC and judicially
noticeable documents, Plaintiffs’ claims regarding the alleged first failure to
provide parking accommodations are time-barred. 
While Plaintiffs take the date their administrative complaint was denied
(September 1, 2021) as the beginning of the statute of limitations period, the
statute of limitations begins to run after the occurrence or termination of the
alleged discriminatory practice and does not include the period during which an
administrative proceeding is pending.  Government Code, §
12989.1(a) states: 
An aggrieved person may commence a civil action in an
appropriate court not later than two years after the occurrence or the
termination of an alleged discriminatory housing practice, or the breach of a
conciliation agreement entered into, whichever occurs last, to obtain
appropriate relief with respect to the discriminatory housing practice or
breach. The computation of the two-year period shall not include any time
during which an administrative proceeding under this part was pending with
respect to a complaint under this part based upon the discriminatory housing
practice or breach.
(Gov’t Code, § 12989.1(a).) 
While an action
based on the conduct in paragraphs 52-53 is time-barred, the action is not
time-barred as to paragraphs 89-90.  (The
Court notes that CCMC has not moved to strike paragraphs 89-90.)  As such, the motion to strike is granted without
leave to amend as to paragraphs 52 and 53. 
However, the Court will allow the allegations in paragraphs 34, 41
(lines 9-10), 42, 45, 48, 49, 51 (lines 10-12), 58-62, 107(b), 107(d), 108
(lines 25-28), 109 (lines 2-5), 120(b), 120(c), 120(f), 128, and 134 to remain
as they allege background facts regarding the parking issue at the premises.
Third, CCMC argues that Plaintiff’s punitive damages allegations are conclusory
and only recite the elements of punitive damages.  In paragraph 102 of the complaint under
“Factual Allegations,” alleges: 
102. As outlined above, the unlawful practices of the Defendants in
retaliating against the Plaintiffs by preventing the sale of the unit were and
are wanton, willful, malicious, fraudulent, or oppressive; were intended to
cause injury to Plaintiff; and/or were done in conscious, callous, reckless, or
blatant disregard for the federally protected rights of Plaintiff, entitling
him to punitive and treble damages.
(SAC,
¶102.)  The prayer for damages at item 2
seeks an award of punitive damages according to proof.  
A complaint including a request for
punitive damages must include allegations showing that the plaintiff is
entitled to an award of punitive damages.  (Clauson v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1253,
1255.)  A claim for punitive damages cannot be pleaded generally and
allegations that a defendant acted "with oppression, fraud and
malice" toward plaintiff are insufficient legal conclusions to show that
the plaintiff is entitled to an award of punitive damages.  (Brousseau v. Jarrett (1977) 73
Cal.App.3d 864, 872.)  Specific factual allegations are required to
support a claim for punitive damages.  (Id.)
Civil Code § 3294
authorizes a plaintiff to obtain an award of punitive damages when there is
clear and convincing evidence that the defendant engaged in malice, oppression,
or fraud.  Section 3294(c) defines the terms in the following manner:
(1)  
"Malice" means conduct which is
intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable
conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious
disregard of the rights or safety of others.
(2)  
"Oppression" means despicable
conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious
disregard of that person's rights.
(3)  
"Fraud" means an intentional
misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact known to the
defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby depriving
a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury. 
CCMC argues that
the SAC does not allege additional, specific facts from the FAC to support an
award of punitive damages.  (The Court
previously granted the motion to strike the allegations for punitive damages in
the FAC for failure to allege facts with the requisite particularity.)  CCMC argues that the SAC’s new facts include
allegations that Defendants sent a letter to Plaintiffs with the purpose to
oppress them by obstructing the sale of their unit, Defendants made deceitful
representations about the approval process only after the DFEH complaint was
filed, Defendants continued to refuse a reasonable accommodation, and Defendants’
interference subjected Plaintiffs to a cruel and unjust hardship by preventing
them from selling their units and refusing to accommodate Plaintiffs.  (SAC, ¶¶83, 87, 91, 93.)  
Plaintiffs argue
that they have alleged more facts that Defendants changed their position about
their approval of the flooring after the DFEH complaint but that they
retaliated after Plaintiffs planned to sell their unit (id., ¶¶67-71);
the HOA president personally oversaw the flooring installation, but continued
to maintain contradictory positions that flooring had not been approved (id.,
¶¶29-32, 69-71); Defendants refused to cooperate with the agents of the
prospective buyers and intended to interfere with Plaintiffs’ sale (id.,
¶¶74, 76, 88-92); Defendants refused to accept the findings of the testing done
regarding the flooring, which prevented the sale of their unit (id.,
¶¶79-85); Defendants fraudulently represented that 2 levels of authorization
were needed to make flooring changes, which was contradictory to prior
instructions and was intended to prevent the sale of their unit (id.,
¶¶84-85), and Defendants interfered with the sale and use of their unit (id.,
¶¶88-92).  
Taking into
consideration all the allegations of the SAC together, the Court finds that the
allegations for punitive damages have been adequately pled.  Whether Plaintiffs will ultimately be able to
prove their entitlement to punitive damages will be determined beyond the
pleading.  As such, the motion to strike
paragraph 102 and the prayer for damages at Item 2 is denied.
