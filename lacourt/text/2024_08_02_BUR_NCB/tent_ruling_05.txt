[TENTATIVE] order RE:
Motion to set aside plaintiff’s default
 



 
BACKGROUND
A.   
Allegations

Plaintiff Juan A. Gonzalez (a
self-represented litigant, “Plaintiff”) filed the first amended complaint
(“FAC”) on November 16, 2023 against Defendant Rafael Rodriguez Villalobos
(“Defendant”). Plaintiff alleges that on October 8, 2022, he took his special
edition 1973 Super Beetle GSR to Defendant’s place of residence/home/work to do
a compression test of the engine only. 
Plaintiff alleges that he left the vehicle with Defendant and after
getting the “run around” for 3 weeks, Plaintiff rented a U-Haul trailer to pick
up his car on November 14, 2022. 
Plaintiff alleges that when he arrived at Defendant’s place, Plaintiff
went to the driver’s door and the handle fell off, but Plaintiff took the
vehicle due to the limited time on the U-Haul. 
Plaintiff alleges that he noticed the engine carburetor had been changed
and the chassis was replaced with an old rusted corroded one.  The FAC alleges causes of action for: (1)
motor vehicle; (2) general negligence; (3) intentional tort; (4) premises
liability; and (5) premises liability.
B.    
Relevant
Background 
On May 26, 2023, Plaintiff filed the
initial complaint.  
On August 3, 2023, the default of
Defendant was entered.  
On November 16, 2023, Plaintiff filed the
FAC. 
C.    
Motion
on Calendar 
On May 13, 2024, Defendant filed a motion
to set aside the default.  
The Court is not in receipt of an opposition
brief. 
DISCUSSION

            Defendant
moves for an order vacating the December 20, 2023 default judgment and to allow
Defendant to file an answer. 
            On
December 20, 2023, Plaintiff attempted to file a request for entry of default
judgment.  That same day, the clerk of
the court rejected the request for entry of default judgment on the ground that
the original proof of service of the amended complaint had not been filed.  Thus, no default judgment was entered against
Defendant on December 20, 2023. As such, the motion to vacate the default
judgment is denied as moot.
            To
the extent that the motion seeks to set aside the default entered on August 3,
2023 based on CCP § 473(b), the motion is untimely.  To be timely under section 473(b), the motion
must have been filed within 6 months of the default, or by February 3,
2024.  The motion was filed on May 13,
2024.  In addition, even if the Court
were to consider the merits of the motion, Defendant moves pursuant to the
mandatory prong of section 473(b) based on attorney fault based on defense
counsel’s inadvertent failure to file a request for an extension of time to
file an answer to the complaint.  (Haney
Decl., ¶2.)  Defendant has not moved to
set aside the default based on any other legal ground.  Thus, to the extent Defendant intended to
move to set aside the default entered on August 3, 2023 pursuant to CCP §
473(b), the motion is denied as untimely. 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
            Defendant Rafael Rodriguez
Villalobos’ motion to set aside the default and default judgment pursuant to
CCP § 473(b) is denied. 
            Defendant
shall
give notice of this order.
