[1] As the Supreme
Court stated in that case: 
We have dealt over and over
again with the question of what constitutes "the right to be heard" (Schroeder v. New York, 371 U.S. 208, 212) within the
meaning of procedural due process. See Mullane v. Central Hanover Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 314. In
the latter case we said that the right to be heard "has
little reality or worth unless one is informed that the matter is pending
and can choose for himself whether to appear or default, acquiesce or contest."
339 U.S., at 314.
(Sniadach v. Family Fin.
Corp., supra, 395 U.S. at 339-340.)


[2] See 7 B. Witkin,
6 California Procedure, Judgments § 397, p. 914 (6th ed. 2021): 
 A final judgment is preclusive only if it was
rendered on the merits. This requirement is derived from the fundamental policy
of the doctrine, which gives stability to judgments after the parties have had
a fair opportunity to litigate their claims and defenses.
