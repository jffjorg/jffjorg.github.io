And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses from Ford Motor Company in a case involving Aurora Mojica and Misael Leyva Galvez, who are seeking to revoke acceptance of a sales contract for a 2021 Ford F-150 vehicle due to defects and nonconformities. The judge notes that the vehicle was delivered with serious defects and nonconformities, including engine, electrical, structural, transmission, and emission system defects, and that the plaintiffs have attempted repairs but were unsuccessful. The judge also notes that Ford Motor Company's opposition brief was filed late, and that the plaintiffs have filed a reply brief. The judge orders the parties to attend the hearing and discusses potential issues related to his prior representation of Ford Motor Company. The judge offers to recuse himself from the case if any party objects, and will continue the hearing on the motion to compel further responses to August 30, 2024, if the parties are willing to waive these issues.
