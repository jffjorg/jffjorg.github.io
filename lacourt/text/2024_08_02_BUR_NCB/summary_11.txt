And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer and motion to strike in a case involving Johnny O'Connor, a plaintiff who alleges that John T. Toal and/or the John T. Toal Trust own a property in Burbank and allowed a dangerous condition to exist, causing harm to Plaintiff. The defendants have filed a demurrer and motion to strike, arguing that the complaint lacks sufficient facts to state a cause of action. The judge has sustained the demurrer to the 1st and 2nd causes of action, which allege general negligence and premises liability, because the complaint fails to allege specific facts about the dangerous condition, injury, and damages. The judge has also sustained the demurrer to the 3rd cause of action, which alleges a violation of Civil Code, § 52.5, because the complaint lacks specific facts about the incident and the alleged violation. The judge has given the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint. The motion to strike is moot and is taken off-calendar.
