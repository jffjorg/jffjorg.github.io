Summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion to compel further responses from the plaintiff, Brandon Edward Bourgeois, in a case against Ford Motor Company and Star Ford Lincoln Mercury. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants failed to promptly replace his 2020 Ford Escape vehicle or make restitution after the vehicle's defects and nonconformities manifested themselves during the warranty period. The plaintiff also alleges that the defendants failed to use ordinary care and skill to properly store, prepare, and repair the vehicle. The defendants have filed a motion to compel the plaintiff's further responses to special interrogatories, but the plaintiff has not filed an opposition brief. The judge notes that he has previously worked on Ford Motor Company matters and may have a perceived bias, but he does not feel that this would impact his decision. The judge orders the parties to attend the next hearing and to discuss whether they would like to waive any objections to his continued involvement in the case. If the parties are willing to waive their objections, the judge will continue the hearing on the motion to compel further responses on August 30, 2024.
