And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants Defendant David Harris' unopposed motions to compel discovery responses from Plaintiffs Allan Lotta and Terezia Korossy. The Plaintiffs failed to respond to Defendant's discovery requests, despite being granted extensions. The Judge orders the Plaintiffs to provide verified responses to the discovery requests without objections within 20 days. The Judge also grants Defendant's request for sanctions against the Plaintiffs and their attorney in the amount of $630, which includes $450 for attorney's fees and $180 in filing fees. The Judge notes that the motions were relatively simple and identical, and that the sanctions are a reasonable amount for the time and effort spent on the motions.
