And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled on the motions to strike filed by Coro Community Management and Consulting, LLC (CCMC) and Vita Bella Homeowners Association (VB HOA). The motions were filed to strike certain paragraphs and the prayer for damages from the second amended complaint (SAC).

The judge denied the motions to strike as to paragraphs 34, 41 (lines 9-10), 42, 45, 48, 49, 51 (lines 10-12), 56-62, 102, 107(b), 107(d), 108 (lines 25-28), 109 (lines 2-5), 120(b), 120(c), 120(f), 128, and 134, and the prayer for damages at Item 2. The judge granted the motions to strike as to paragraphs 52-53 without leave to amend.

The judge also denied the motions to strike as to the claims for punitive damages, finding that the allegations for punitive damages have been adequately pled. The judge noted that the allegations in the SAC provide specific facts that support a claim for punitive damages.

The judge ordered that each party provide notice of the tentative ruling.
