And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant Rafael Rodriguez Villalobos' motion to set aside the default and default judgment. The motion was filed late and does not meet the requirements of California Civil Procedure Code (CCP) § 473(b). The judge notes that no default judgment was entered against Defendant on December 20, 2023, and that the motion to vacate the default judgment is therefore denied as moot. The judge also finds that the motion is untimely and that Defendant has not moved to set aside the default based on any other legal ground. The judge orders that Defendant give notice of this order.
