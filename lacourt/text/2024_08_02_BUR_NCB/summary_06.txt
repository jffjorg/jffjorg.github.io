  - "The documents sought are not limited in scope and potentially seek documents regarding any Ford vehicle that has the 10R80 transmission, regardless of whether the defect/issue complained of is the same as the issue in Plaintiff's subject vehicle."
  - "The Court will only grant these requests to the limited extent that any document referred to in the course of responding to the lemon law repurchase case in this case should be produced—unless there is a claim of privilege."
