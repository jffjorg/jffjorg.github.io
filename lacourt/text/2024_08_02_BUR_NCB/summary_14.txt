And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Counsel's motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Stephen Harold Smith. Counsel filed the motion on June 10, 2024, citing a significant breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, which has impaired their ability to effectively prosecute the case. Counsel has made efforts to serve Plaintiff and Defendant, but has been unable to confirm Plaintiff's address. The Judge finds that there is sufficient time for Plaintiff to obtain substitute counsel before the next hearing date, set for October 15, 2024. The order will become effective upon the filing of a proof of service of a signed copy of the order on Plaintiff.
