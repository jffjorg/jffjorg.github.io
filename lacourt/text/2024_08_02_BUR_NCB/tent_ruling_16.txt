·        
Merexmortals Guaranty: Merexmortals entered into a series of
written Corporate Guaranties on Agreements #4-8.  (Miller Decl., ¶¶172-180, Ex. 34.)  
Ms.
Miller states that Plaintiff is entitled to possession of all the collateral in
Defendants’ possession based on the language of the agreements, but that
Defendants have failed to return the collateral.   (Miller Decl., ¶¶181-185, 202-206.)  
Ms. Miller’s declaration provides evidence
to establish the probable validity of Plaintiff’s claim to possession of the
subject collateral against Defendants because it shows that Plaintiff has the
right to take immediate possession of the collateral as a result of Defendants’
default on the written Agreements and Guaranties.  The applications are not opposed and
Defendants are each in default.  
B.    
Location of Vehicle 
Under CCP §
512.010(b)(4), the plaintiff must provide evidence of the location of the
property.  Further, if the property is
within a private place which may have to be entered to take possession, section
(b)(4) requires there to be a showing that there is probable cause to believe
that the property is located there.             
Ms. Miller states
that the last known locations of the Merexmortals and MXM collateral are: 
a. 5899 Compton Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90001;
b. 1812 Foothill Drive, Glendale, CA 91201;
c. 4501 Mitchell Street, Suite A, North Las Vegas, NV 89081;
d. 9813 Twilight Moon Avenue, Las Vegas, NV 89148; or
e. Another address known to Defendants.
(Applications at § 6; Miller Decl.,
¶¶187, 208.)  
These facts are
sufficient to identify the potential locations of the vehicle at Defendants’
addresses.  
C.     Undertaking 
Finally,
CCP § 512.060 requires that an undertaking be filed before a writ of possession
may be issued.  CCP § 515.010(a) states
that the undertaking shall be set at an amount not less than twice the value of
the defendant's interest in the property. 
In addition, CCP § 515.010(a) defines the value of the defendant's
interest in the property as the market value of the property less the amount
due and owing on any conditional sales contract or security agreement and all
liens and encumbrances on the property, and any other factors necessary to
determine the defendant's interest in the property.  When a defendant does not have any interest
in the property, CCP § 515.010(b) permits the Court to waive the requirement of
the plaintiff's undertaking and set an undertaking for the defendant to keep
possession or regain possession.  
            If
the defendant seeks to retain possession of the property, CCP § 515.020 permits
the defendant to file an undertaking and retain the property in an amount equal
to the amount of the plaintiff’s undertaking determined in CCP § 515.010(a), or
in an amount determined by the Court pursuant to CCP § 515.010(b).  
            Ms. Miller provides the estimates
for the combined auction resale value of the collateral subject to the
Merexmortal agreements to be:
·        
For the collateral under Agreement #1, she estimates
$12,000.  
·        
For the collateral under Agreement #2, she estimates
$45,000.  
·        
Total Merexmortals Collateral: $57,000. 
(Miller Decl., ¶¶197-198.)  She states that Plaintiff has an unpaid
principal balance of $161,335.41 on the Merexmortals agreements, such that
Plaintiff is under-secured as to the value of the collateral is below what is
owed.  (Id., ¶199.)  This indicates that, for the purposes of CCP
§ 515.010, Defendants have no interest in the vehicle.  Accordingly, the Court waives the requirement
for Plaintiff to file an undertaking on the Merexmortals collateral because
Defendants have no interest in the collateral. 
Ms.
Miller provides the estimates for the combined auction resale value of the
collateral subject to the MXM agreements to be:
·        
For the collateral under Agreement #4, she estimates
$108,000.  
·        
For the collateral under Agreement #5, she estimates $18,000.
·        
For the collateral under Agreement #6, she estimates
$236,000.
·        
For the collateral under Agreement #7, she estimates $83,000.
·        
For the collateral under Agreement #8, she estimates
$105,000.
·        
Total MXM Collateral: $550,000. 
(Miller
Decl., ¶¶217-218.)  She states that
Plaintiff has an unpaid principal balance of $1,400,481.75 on the MXM
agreements, such that Plaintiff is under-secured as to the value of the
collateral is below what is owed.  (Id.,
¶219.)  This indicates that, for the
purposes of CCP § 515.010, Defendants have no interest in the vehicle.  Accordingly, the Court waives the requirement
for Plaintiff to file an undertaking on the MXM collateral because Defendants
have no interest in the collateral. 
            As the application is not opposed,
it does not appear that Defendants seek to retain possession of the collateral.

CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
Plaintiff’s three applications for a writ
of possession against Defendants Merexmortals, Inc., MXM NV, Inc., and Adde
Issagholi are granted.  The Court issues
the requested writ of possession to obtain the collateral listed in Attachment
4 of the application papers at the following addresses: (a) 5899 Compton Avenue, Los Angeles,
CA 90001; (b) 1812 Foothill Drive, Glendale, CA 91201; (c) 4501 Mitchell
Street, Suite A, North Las Vegas, NV 89081; and (d) 9813 Twilight Moon Avenue,
Las Vegas, NV 89148.  The Court notes,
however, that it does not have the power to order levying officers in this
state to seize property in Nevada. Neither does it have the power to order
levying officers in Nevada to do anything. It is the Court’s advisory view that
this order or the judgment in this case must be confirmed in a Nevada Court to
be carried out in that state. 
The requirement
for Plaintiff to post an undertaking is waived. 

Plaintiff shall
provide notice of this order.
