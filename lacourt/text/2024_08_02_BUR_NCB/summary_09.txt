And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to compel further responses from Ford Motor Company (FMC) in a case brought by plaintiffs Aurora Mojica and Misael Leyva Galvez. The plaintiffs allege that FMC delivered a 2021 Ford F-150 vehicle with serious defects and nonconformities, and that they have delivered the vehicle to Galpin Motors Inc. for repairs, but Galpin failed to properly store, prepare, and repair the vehicle. The judge notes that FMC filed an untimely opposition brief and that the parties should discuss whether they would like the case to proceed in this Department. The judge is willing to continue the hearing on the motion to compel further responses to August 30, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. if the parties are willing to waive the issues. The judge also discloses that he worked on Ford Motor Company matters at Hughes Hubbard & Reed in the past, but does not feel biased and is willing to recuse himself if necessary.
