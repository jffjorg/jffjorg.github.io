And here is a brief English-language summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's three applications for a writ of possession against the defendants, Merexmortals, Inc., MXM NV, Inc., and Adde Issagholi. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants breached written agreements and guaranties, and the judge finds that the plaintiff is entitled to possession of the collateral listed in Attachment 4 of the application papers. The judge also waives the requirement for the plaintiff to file an undertaking on the Merexmortals and MXM collateral because the defendants have no interest in the collateral. The judge orders the writ of possession to be issued, instructing the plaintiff to provide notice of the order.
