And here is the English-text summary:

In this tentative ruling, the Judge grants the defense motions to compel form and special interrogatories, as well as the production of documents. The Judge orders the plaintiff to provide verified answers to the interrogatories within 20 days, except for questions related to attorney-client privilege. The Judge also orders the plaintiff to produce documents with a compliance document indicating which pages respond to which request within 20 days, except for documents protected by attorney-client privilege.

The Judge denies monetary sanctions for the plaintiff's failure to meet and confer. The Judge emphasizes the importance of meet and confer to avoid unnecessary law and motion, and notes that it is rare to see no meet and confer. The Judge notes that a simple phone call or letter reminding counsel to respond to discovery can often resolve outstanding discovery requests.

The Judge also notes that the moving party's argument that "no response" is not amenable to meet and confer is mistaken. The Judge orders the moving party to provide a separate filing fee for each discovery request in the future and to attach discovery requests to a declaration.

Finally, the Judge requires an explanation from Wenqian Cai for the "pending" state bar number while representing themselves as an attorney. The Judge orders the Clerk of the court to give notice of this decision.
