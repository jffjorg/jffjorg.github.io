And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge is granting Mountain Recovery, LLC's motion to extend the duration of the Order for Appearance and Examination (ORAP) Lien against Alexander Everest's personal property. The new expiration date of the ORAP Lien is August 20, 2024. The judge finds that the extension is necessary because the debtor is being evasive with his assets and there is a risk that he will transfer assets to third parties if the ORAP Lien is allowed to expire. The judge also finds that the January 15, 2021 stipulation and order extending the examination order also extended the ORAP Lien. The judge rejects the debtor's argument that the extension is invalid and finds that the ORAP Lien can only be limited by the 10-year enforceability of the judgment.
