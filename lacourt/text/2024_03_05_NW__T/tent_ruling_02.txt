 Case Number:  23VECV01443    Hearing Date:   March 5, 2024    Dept:  T 23VECV01443 Mazariegos v Rodesno
Tentative ruling: Defense Motions to Compel Form and Special Interrogatories, and Production of Documents: Grant.
As to the interrogatories, verified answers without objection except as to attorney client privilege due within 20 days.
As to the production of documents, verified Code Compliant responses without objection except as to attorney client privilege, and production of documents, Bates stamped with a compliance document indicating which pages are in response to which request within 20 days.
The court does not find a waiver of the attorney client privilege which belongs to the client and must be based on a knowing waiver.
Monetary sanctions denied for failure to meet and confer.  The case law cited by the moving party is from 1980 and the law since then is to encourage meet and confer to avoid unnecessary law and motion.  It is rare to see no meet and confer, such as a simple phone call or letter reminding counsel to respond to the discovery.  Moving party is mistaken that “no response” is not amenable to meet and confer; to the contrary, a reminder that there is outstanding discovery almost always triggers the response and there may be good reason they were not responded to, such as the attorney is ill, or the mailing address was incorrect, or the mail was not received, or myriad other reasons.  Every effort should be made to resolve discovery disputes before filing any discovery motion.  The goal is to avoid law and motion.
In the future, each discovery request requires its own motion with a separate filing fee.  The discovery in issue should have been attached to a declaration.  Failure to follow procedures may result in future motions not being heard.
Finally, the court will require an explanation of the state bar number for Wenqian Cai being "pending" while representing themselves to be an attorney.
Clerk of the court to give notice.
