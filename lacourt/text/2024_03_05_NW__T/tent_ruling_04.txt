ALEXANDER EVEREST
[TENTATIVE] ORDER:  Judgment Creditor Mountain Recovery, LLC’s
Motion to Extend Duration of the ORAP Lien is GRANTED.  The new expiration date of the ORAP Lien is
August 20, 2024.  
Introduction 
Judgment Creditor Mountain
Recovery, LLC (Creditor) moved to extend the duration of the Order for
Appearance and Examination (ORAP) Lien against Judgment Debtor Alexander
Everest’s (Debtor) personal property.
Discussion 
Creditor requested that the ORAP
Lien against Debtor’s personal property be extended for six months, so as to
expire on August 20, 2024.  (Code Civ.
Proc., sec. 708.110(d).)  Creditor
asserted that the extension is necessary because the Debtor is being evasive
with his assets.  Creditor asserted that
a risk exists that Creditor will transfer assets to third parties if the ORAP
Lien is allowed to expire.  On these
grounds, there is sufficient showing to extend the ORAP Lien. 
Debtor disputed the validity of
the extensions of the original March 10, 2020 ORAP Lien.  Debtor argued that the original ORAP Lien
expired on its own terms on March 10, 2021 and the extension obtained by
Creditor on March 16, 2021 was invalid because it was obtained after the ORAP
Lien expired and the request to extend was based upon a fraud upon the
Court.  (Sepehr Omrani Decl., Exhs. A and
F.)  However, at a January 15, 2021
Informal Discovery Conference, the Court via stipulation of the parties
continued the “[t]ime to which to conduct a judgment examination hearing” to
May 28, 2021.  (Omrani Decl., Exh.
D.)  The parties are in dispute over
whether this Stipulation and Order as to the examination order also extended
the ORAP Lien.  The Court notes that
service of an examination order created the ORAP Lien since the statute
expressly provides for the creation of the ORAP Lien upon service of the
examination order.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
sec. 708.110(d).)  It would be logical
that the two are coupled together.  Decoupling the examination order from the ORAP
Lien would be illogical because the purpose of the examination of the debtor is
to furnish information to aid in the enforcement of the money judgment.  (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 708.110(a).)  Without the ORAP Lien, a debtor would be free
to dispose of any personal property prior to the examination and simply attest
to the lack of possession of any personal property.  Debtor’s argument that the January 15, 2021
stipulation and order did not work to extend the ORAP Lien is
unpersuasive.  Sufficient evidence has
been presented to show that the initial expiration date of March 10, 2021 was
timely extended to May 28, 2021 via the Court’s January 15, 2021 stipulation
and order extending the examination order. 
Therefore, the Court’s ruling at the March 16, 2021 extending the ORAP
Lien to September 23, 2021 was timely and valid .  Debtor’s argument is unpersuasive.  
ORAP Liens are only limited by
the 10 year enforceability of the judgment. 
(Code Civ. Proc., sec. 683.020(c).)
IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE
NOTICE.
