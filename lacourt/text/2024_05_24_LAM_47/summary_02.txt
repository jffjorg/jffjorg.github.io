And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants Plaintiff Jesse Rosales' Motion to Compel Further Responses to specific requests for production propounded to Defendant FCA US LLC. The court finds that Defendant's responses were incomplete and inadequate, and that Defendant failed to justify its objections to the requests. The court orders Defendant to provide verified, code-compliant responses without objections to Requests for Production Nos. 16 through 21 within 30 days of this order. The court also notes that Defendant's supplemental responses served on February 6, 2024, were unaccompanied by a verification, and that unverified responses to discovery are tantamount to no response at all.
