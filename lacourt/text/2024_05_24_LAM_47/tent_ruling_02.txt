CASE
HISTORY:
·        
06/02/23: Complaint filed. 
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a lemon law action filed on June 2, 2023. Plaintiff purchased a
2020 Jeep Wrangler which subsequently developed defects in the body,
powertrain, safety and electrical systems, and the brakes. 
 
Plaintiff moves to compel further
responses to specific requests for production propounded to Defendant. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
            Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Further Responses is GRANTED.
 
            Defendant
is ordered to provide verified, code-compliant responses without objections to
Requests for Production Nos. 16 through 21 within 30 days of this order. 
 
DISCUSSION:
 
Plaintiff moves to compel further
responses to specific requests for production propounded to Defendant. 
 
//
Legal Standard
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310, subdivision (a), a court
may order a party to serve a further response to a demand for inspection when
the court finds that: “(1) A statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete[;] (2) A representation of inability to comply is inadequate,
incomplete, or evasive[; or] (3) An objection in the response is without merit
or too general.”
 
The burden is on the moving party to “set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (b)(1).) These facts must also be set forth in a separate
statement filed by the moving party. (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1345(c).) This
burden “is met simply by a fact-specific showing of relevance.” (TBG Ins.
Servs. Corp. v. Superior Court (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 443, 448.)
 
Timeliness
 
A motion to compel further
responses to requests for production must be served “within 45 days of the
service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or on
or before any specific later date to which the propounding party and the responding
party have agreed in writing.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310(c).) The 45-day
requirement is mandatory and jurisdictional. (Sexton v. Superior Court¿(1997)
58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)
 
            Plaintiff propounded this discovery
at issue in this motion on September 15, 2023. (Declaration of Noreelie Panhwar
ISO Mot. ¶ 10; Exh. 2.) Defendant’s original responses were served
electronically on October 16, 2023, with document production on December 5,
2023, and verifications on January 30, 2024. (Id. ¶¶ 11-12; Exhs. 3-4.) Plaintiff’s
counsel states that Defendant supplemented its production on February 6, 2024,
without supplemental responses or verifications. (Id. ¶ 14.) On March
18, 2024, the parties attended an Informal Discovery Conference at which they
orally stipulated to extend the motion deadline to April 2, 2024. (March 18,
2024 Minute Order.) That stipulation was entered as the order of the Court. (Id.)
This motion was filed and served on that extended date, and is therefore
timely. 
 
Meet and Confer
 
A party making a motion to compel further responses must also include a
declaration stating facts showing a “reasonable and good faith attempt” to
resolve informally the issues presented by the motion before filing the motion.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2016.040, 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).)
 
            The Declaration of Noreelie Panhwar
in support of the motion describes Plaintiff’s extensive efforts to informally
resolve this dispute, including multiple meet-and-confer letters and an
informal discovery conference. (Panhwar Decl. ¶¶ 18-24.) Plaintiff has
therefore satisfied his statutory meet and confer obligations. 
Good Cause
 
            Plaintiff moves to compel further
responses to Requests for Production Nos. 16-21. These requests seek all
documents relating to internal analysis or investigation into the “engine
defect” (Panhwar Decl. Exh. 2. No. 16), communications regarding the “engine
defect” (No. 17); decisions to issue notices, letters, campaigns, warranty
extensions, technical service bulletins, and recalls concerning the “engine
defect” (No. 18); customer complaints, reported failures, and warranty claims;
(No. 19); failure rates as a result of the “engine defect” (No. 20); and fixes
for the “engine defect.” (No. 21.) All requests pertain not only to the subject
vehicle but to vehicles of the same year, make, and model. The requests define
“engine defect to mean:
 
such defects which result in symptoms
including, but not limited to: illumination of Check Engine Light (CEL),
Service Engine Soon (SES) Light, or Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL); engine
misfire; engine overheating; coolant leak; faulty thermostat; defective coolant
hose; cracked engine block; premature failure of engine block; and any other
concern identified in the repair history for the subject 2020 Jeep Wrangler;
Vehicle Identification Number 1C4HJXDN6LW198146.
 
(Panhwar Decl. Exh. 2.
p.3:14:20.) 
 
            Evidence of similar defects
in other vehicles is both relevant and admissible. (Donlen v. Ford Motor Co.
(2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 138, 153.) Admissible evidence is discoverable. (Glenfed
Development Corp. v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1113, 1117-18.)
Documents regarding warranty complaints, service histories, and employee
records concerning a defect in all affected vehicles, as well as documents
regarding the manufacturer’s responses and instructions to cure that defect are
discoverable. (See Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th
967, 971 [holding that the trial court’s approval of a discovery referee’s
report and recommendation of sanctions for failure to produce documents of this
nature relating to the subject defect in all affected vehicles was not an abuse
of discretion].) Applying this
well-settled precedent, the Court therefore finds that Plaintiff has shown good
cause for these requests. 
 
Defendant’s
Responses
 
            In response to each request, Defendant
asserted substantially identical boilerplate objections that the requests were
not reasonably particularized, were overbroad and argumentative, that the
definition of “engine defect” was not sufficiently specific, that the
definition of “your” in reference to Defendant was overbroad, that the requests
seek confidential or privileged information, that the request for
electronically stored information is overbroad and unduly burdensome, and that
the vehicle was purchased used and therefore not subject to the remedies of the
Song-Beverly Act. (See, e.g., Panhwar Decl. Exh. 3. No. 16.) Defendant also
specifically objected to Request No. 18 arguing it seeks information regarding
other customers which is irrelevant and violates their privacy rights. (Id.
No. 18.) 
 
            In opposition, Defendant first
argues that Plaintiff did not address the sufficiency of Defendant’s
supplemental production, acknowledged by Plaintiffs as served on February 6,
2024. (Panhwar Decl. ¶ 14.) Defendant states that its supplemental responses
were served on January 30, 2024, by email. (Declaration of Michael J. Gregg ISO
Opp. ¶ 11, Exh. F.) However, those supplemental responses are unaccompanied by
a verification, and
unverified responses to discovery are tantamount to no response at all. (See Steven M. Garber & Associates v. Eskandarian
(2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 813, 817 fn 4.) Moreover, Defendant fails to justify any
of its objections beyond baldly asserting that the responses are overbroad and
irrelevant, or, alternatively, that Plaintiff has not demonstrated that the
objections are invalid. However, the burden is on Defendant to justify
any failure to fully respond to these requests. (See Coy v. Superior Court
(1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220–221.) Defendant has failed to do so. Plaintiff is
therefore entitled to an order compelling further responses. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses is GRANTED.
 
            Defendant
is ordered to provide verified, code-compliant responses without objections to
Requests for Production Nos. 16 through 21 within 30 days of this order. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
