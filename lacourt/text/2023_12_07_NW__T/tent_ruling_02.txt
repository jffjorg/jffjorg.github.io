 Case Number:  22VECV01916    Hearing Date:   December 7, 2023    Dept:  T 22VECV01916
Moore v BN Dealerships Management
Tentative
ruling: Defense ex parte application for order shortening time/motion to
continue the trial: The court denies the ex parte application to shorten
time.  No good cause has been shown.  However, the court advance the hearing on the
motion to allow it to be heard on 12/28/2023 at 8:30 a.m. which is on regular
notice and within the time to have a discovery motion heard. The request to continue
the trial is denied.
Defendant
appeared by answer filed on 1/17/2023, almost 1 year ago in this motor vehicle
collision case.  FSC and Trial was set at
the CMC on 3/9/2023.  CMCs were also held
on 6/5/2023 and 9/7/2023.  All counsel were
advised on 3/9/2023, 6/5/2023 and 9/7/2023 that the trial of 1/12/204 would not
be continued, and nobody expressed any concerns concerning discovery completion.
Defendant sent a depo notice of plaintiff on 10/3/2023 for depo on 11/2/2023,
10 months after appearance in the case. The depo took place 11/2/2023 but
defense wanted additional documents to be produced.  Plaintiff’s counsel notified defense counsel the
next day on 11/3/2023 that certain pages of documents were being produced but
no others.  The transcript was prepared
11/14/2023.  The motion to compel was filed
12/1/2023. The ex parte for order shortening time is being heard 12/7/2023.
The court
will not shorten time because defendant waited until late in the case to take
the plaintiff’s deposition and there is no unexpected” emergency.  The court will
not continue the trial date as it has indicated in 3 different CMCs that it
would not do so.  There is no good cause
shown to shorten time or continue the trial. 
First, the deposition of the plaintiff could have been taken months earlier.  Next, defense counsel knew on 11/3/2023 that
no additional documents were going to be produced.  Despite that, another month went by before
the motion to compel was filed.  Had the
motion been promptly filed, the motion might have been heard already.  Finally, all counsel knew the court would not
continue the trial. 
Moving
party to give notice of the new hearing date.
