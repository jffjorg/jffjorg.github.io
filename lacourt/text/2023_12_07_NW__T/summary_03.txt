Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendants, Quanta Finance, LLC and 1 Sharpe Opportunity Intermediate Trust. The defendants argued that the first cause of action for accounting was uncertain, that the second cause of action for negligent misrepresentation was insufficiently pled, that the third cause of action for UCL violation lacked standing, and that the fourth cause of action for usury was unclear.

The judge has ruled that the demurrer to the first cause of action for accounting is overruled, the demurrer to the second cause of action for negligent misrepresentation is sustained with 20 days leave to amend, the demurrer to the third cause of action for UCL violation is overruled, and the demurrer to the fourth cause of action for usury is overruled.

The judge has also criticized the defendants' arguments, stating that they are unpersuasive and border on frivolous. The judge has emphasized that the allegations in the First Amended Complaint must be accepted as true for the purposes of the demurrer and that the court will not consider facts outside the face of the complaint.
