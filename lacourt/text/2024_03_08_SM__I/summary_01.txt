And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to compel, granting the motion except for request 1, which is denied. The judge is convinced that the defendants have deliberately ignored their discovery obligations and are forcing the plaintiffs to bring separate motions for each item of discovery. As a result, the judge has lost confidence in the defendants' and their counsel's good faith. The judge has waived the privilege and ordered the defendants to produce documents and pay sanctions. The judge also warns that the discovery responses may not be trustworthy and may affect the upcoming motion for summary judgment. The judge will discuss this further with the parties at the hearing.
