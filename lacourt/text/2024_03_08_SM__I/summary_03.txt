Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to discovery requests. The court finds that defendant's responses to the discovery requests were inadequate and that defendant's objections were made in bad faith. The court orders defendant to produce the requested documents, including bank statements, and to provide a verified statement confirming that all such statements have been produced. The court also grants plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $7,608 against defendant, but not against defendant's counsel. The court denies defendant's request for sanctions against plaintiff's counsel.
