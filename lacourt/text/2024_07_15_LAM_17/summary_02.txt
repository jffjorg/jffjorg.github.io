And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling continues Defendant Michael Johnson's motion to dismiss the action, originally scheduled for July 15, 2024, to August 1, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. The Court agrees with Defendant's argument that Plaintiff is attempting to improperly re-litigate the allegation of defective service, which was already addressed in another case (BC717979). However, due to a discrepancy over service of the motion, the Court finds it appropriate to continue the motion to provide Plaintiff an opportunity to oppose the motion on the merits.
