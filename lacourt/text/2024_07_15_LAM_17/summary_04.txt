```

The judge's tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction, finding that the Plaintiff is likely to succeed on the merits of its claims, that it will suffer irreparable harm if alleged conduct is not enjoined, and that its entitlement to an injunction outweighs any harm to the opposing parties. The ruling also sets forth the scope of the injunction, which will restrain Defendants from soliciting a small percentage of the potential customers available to them, and will prevent them from using Plaintiff's confidential trade secret business information to develop their competing business. The Court may set a bond amount at hearing based on the arguments presented.
