And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the defendants' notice of motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's first amended complaint. The defendants argue that the complaint is unintelligible and subject to demurrer due to the superfluous definition of "defendants." The court declines to consider this new argument as it was raised for the first time in the defendants' reply. The court also notes that the proofs of service filed by the plaintiff do not reference the first amended complaint. The court will issue a final ruling after considering the parties' arguments.
