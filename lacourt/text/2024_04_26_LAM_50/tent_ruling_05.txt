[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
 
PLAINTIFF’S AMENDED
  & CORRECTED REFILING OF PLAINTIFF’S NOTICE OF ERRATA PURSUANT TO C.C.P. § 473(a)(1) 
 




            
Plaintiff
Briand WMS Esquire, “individually, on behalf of himself, the
general public and on behalf of all other persons and class similarly situated,
that is, a class of claimants whose rights were violated as were Esquire,”
(herein, “Plaintiff”) filed this action on November 30, 2022 against a number
of defendants. 
On July 17, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended
Complaint, alleging twenty causes of action. 
The Court notes that on February 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed a “Motion to
Court of Plaintiff’s Request for Leave of the Court to File Second Amended
Complaint for Damages and for Demand for Jury Trial.” On February 28, 2024, the
Court issued an Order denying Plaintiff’s motion for leave to file a second
amended complaint without prejudice.[1] 
On March 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed a “Notice of Errata Pursuant to
C.C.P. § 473(a)(1)” which provides, inter alia,
that “BRIAND WMS ESQUIRE, hereby submits this Notice of Errata to Plaintiff’s
previously filed ‘FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND DEMAND FOR JURY
TRIAL’ FILED 07-17-23.” (Plaintiff’s March 1, 2024 Notice of Errata, p. 1:17-19,
emphasis omitted.) The Notice of Errata attaches a document captioned “Errata
on First Amended Complaint for Damages and Demand for Jury Trial.” 
On March 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed an “Amended & Corrected
Refiling of Plaintiff’s Notice of Errata Pursuant to C.C.P. § 473(a)(1).” This Notice of Errata provides, inter
alia, that “BRIAND WMS ESQUIRE, hereby submits this AMENDED & CORRECTED
REFILING OF PLAINTIFF’S NOTICE OF ERRATA PURSUANT TO C.C.P. § 473(a)(1) to Plaintiff’s previously filed NOTICE OF
ERRATA REGARDING THE ‘FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND DEMAND FOR JURY
TRIAL’ FILED 07-17-23.” (Plaintiff’s March 11, 2024 Amended Notice of Errata,
p. 1:17-21, emphasis omitted.) The Notice of Errata attaches a document
captioned “Errata on First Amended Complaint for Damages and Demand for Jury
Trial.” 
A hearing on a motion for leave to amend is scheduled for April 26,
2024 at 10:00 a.m. in this action. However, it does not appear that Plaintiff
filed any revised motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. Rather,
Plaintiff filed the above-referenced notices of errata. 
The Court notes that pursuant to California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1112,
subdivision (a), “[u]nless otherwise
provided by the rules in this division, the papers filed in support of a motion
must consist of at least the following: (1) A notice of hearing on the motion;
(2) The motion itself; and (3) A memorandum in support of the motion or
demurrer.” It does not appear that Plaintiff filed any notice of hearing on a
motion, a motion, or a memorandum in support of any motion. 
In light of the foregoing, any purported motion set for hearing on
April 26, 2024 is denied. 
///
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this order.
