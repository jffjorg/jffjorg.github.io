  ORDER RE:
 
MOTION TO STRIKE
  PARTS OF PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT



 
Background
Plaintiff Christopher
Castro (“Plaintiff”) filed this
action on May 5, 2023 against Defendant Dongalen Enterprises, Inc. d/b/a
Interstate Plastics (“Defendant”). The Complaint alleges causes of action for (1)
disability discrimination, (2) failure to provide reasonable accommodation, (3)
failure to engage in the interactive process, (4) retaliation in violation of
FEHA, (5) failure to prevent discrimination and retaliation, (6) whistleblower
retaliation, 
(7)
violation of California Family Rights Act (“CFRA”) rights, (8) “CFRA rights
retaliation,”
(9)
wrongful termination in violation of public policy, and (10) negligent hiring,
retention, and supervision.  
Defendant now moves to strike portions of Plaintiff’s Complaint.
Plaintiff opposes. 
Discussion 
As an initial matter,
the Court notes that Defendant’s counsel’s declaration filed in support of the
motion indicates, inter alia, that “[o]n June 27, 2023, counsel
for Defendant sent a meet and confer email requesting that Plaintiff withdraw
his plea for punitive damages against Defendant on the grounds that the
Complaint failed to state specific facts sufficient to support a conclusion that
Defendant acted with oppression, fraud or malice. The email also conveyed
Defendant’s intention to file a Motion to Strike the plea for punitive damages
should Plaintiff refuse to withdraw the plea voluntarily.” (Chavez Decl., ¶ 3.)

The Court notes that Defendant’s
counsel’s declaration does not demonstrate that the parties met and
conferred in person, by telephone, or by video
conference. Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 435.5,
subdivision (a), “[b]efore filing a motion to strike pursuant to this chapter, the
moving party shall meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by
video conference with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to
the motion to strike for the purpose of determining if an agreement can be
reached that resolves the objections to be raised in the motion to strike.”
(Emphasis added.) Such
meeting and conferring must be done in good faith with an effort to try to
resolve the issues subject to the motion to strike. 
In light of the foregoing,
the hearing on Defendant’s
motion to strike is continued to _______________, 2024 at 10 a.m. in Dept.
50. 
Defendant
is¿ordered to meet¿and confer¿with Plaintiff within 10 days of the date of this
order.¿If the parties are unable to resolve the pleading issues¿or if the
parties are otherwise unable to meet and confer in good faith, Defendant is to¿thereafter¿file
and serve¿a declaration setting forth the efforts to meet and confer in
compliance with Code
of Civil Procedure section 435.5, subdivision (a)(3) within 15 days of this order.¿
Defendant is ordered to give notice of this order.
