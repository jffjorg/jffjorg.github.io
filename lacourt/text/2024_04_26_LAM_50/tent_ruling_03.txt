[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: 
 
MOTION TO
  CONTINUE TRIAL




AND RELATED CROSS-ACTION


 



 
Background
Plaintiff
The Testing Company, LLC (“TTC”) filed this action on October 31, 2022 against
Defendant Enigma Management Corp. dba Alliance Laboratories (“Enigma”). 
TTC filed the operative Third Amended
Complaint (“TAC”) on January 19, 2024, alleging causes of action for (1) breach
of oral contract, (2) common count for services rendered, (3) promissory
estoppel, (4) breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing, (5) negligent
misrepresentation, (6) concealment, and (7) unjust enrichment. 
            On
February 6, 2024, Enigma filed a Cross-Complaint against TTC. The
Cross-Complaint alleges causes of action for (1) negligence, (2) unjust
enrichment, and (3) quantum meruit. 
The
trial date in this action is currently set for May 8, 2024. The Final Status
Conference (“FSC”) is currently set for April 26, 2024. 
Enigma
now moves to continue the FSC and trial date in this action. TTC
opposes.  
 
Discussion
“The court may grant a
continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the
continuance.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, subd.
(c).) “In ruling on a motion or application for continuance, the court must
consider all the facts and circumstances that are relevant to the
determination.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, subd.
(d).) 
Enigma requests that the
Court “continue trial so that the pleadings will be at issue, the parties can
complete discovery, and Enigma will have adequate time to move for summary
adjudication.” (Mot. at p. 4:13-16.) 
Enigma notes that TTC filed the operative TAC on January 19,
2024. On February 20, 2024, Enigma filed a demurrer to the TAC. On February 21,
2024, Enigma filed a motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages in
the TAC. As noted by Enigma, its
demurrer to the TAC and motion to strike portions of the TAC are set to be
heard on May 17, 2024, after the May 8, 2024 trial date currently set in
this action. 
Enigma also notes that
on February 6, 2024, Enigma filed a Cross-Complaint against TTC. In his supporting
declaration, Enigma’s counsel states that “Enigma hasn’t yet
taken any discovery on its Cross-Complaint.” (Ruttenberg Decl., ¶ 5.) In
addition, Enigma’s counsel states that “Enigma hasn’t yet deposed Plaintiff’s
PMQ, whose deposition is set on April 5, 2024.” (Ruttenberg Decl., ¶ 8.) 
Enigma’s counsel also states that “Enigma intends to move for summary
adjudication on multiple issues in the TAC or any later-amended Complaint that
Plaintiff may file. Even if we filed that motion now, (a) it couldn’t get
timely heard before trial and (b) any amended Complaint that Plaintiff may file
would render moot any motion that Enigma had filed as to the TAC or other
superseded pleading.” (Ruttenberg Decl., ¶ 9.) 
In
the opposition, TTC asserts that “there is no good cause to grant a
continuance.” (Opp’n at p. 2:19.) California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1332, subdivision (c) sets forth circumstances that may indicate good cause for a trial
continuance. TTC asserts that none of these circumstances exist here. In
addition, TTC asserts that none of the factors set forth in California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332,
subdivision (d) weigh
in favor of granting a trial continuance here. 
But as noted by Enigma in the motion, circumstances relevant to the Court’s
determination of a motion for a trial continuance include, inter alia,
“[w]hether the interests of justice are best served by a continuance, by the
trial of the matter, or by imposing conditions on the continuance,” and “[t]he proximity of the trial date.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, subds. (d)(1),
(d)(10).) Another relevant circumstance is “[a]ny other fact or circumstance relevant to the fair
determination of the motion or application.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1332, subd. (d)(11).) The Court finds
that the foregoing circumstances are relevant here. As discussed, Enigma
asserts that “the pleadings are not even at issue
and Enigma’s Demurrer to and Motion to Strike the Third Amended Complaint…won’t
be heard until May 17, 2024–after the current trial date.” (Mot. at p. 2:5-8.)
Enigma also asserts that it “intends to move for summary adjudication on
multiple issues in the TAC or any later-amended Complaint that Plaintiff may
file.” (Mot. at p. 5:22-23.)  
TTC also argues that “Plaintiff will suffer considerable prejudice if
the trial date is continued. Plaintiff went out of pocket to cover costs
associated with the testing services. Not only was Plaintiff never reimbursed,
it did not receive its 50% split of the monies owed to it for the services
performed. Plaintiff has waited years to receive the money it is owed, while
Defendant has likely earned interest on Plaintiff’s money. Granting this
extension will simply delay the payment that Plaintiff is owed, and further
unjustly enrich Defendant.” (Opp’n at p. 4:7-12.) The Court notes that TTC does
not provide any evidence to support this argument. 
Lastly, TTC asserts that “Defendant’s
pending demurrer is not a reason to extend the trial date in this matter. The
demurrer can be decided alongside the other pre-trial motions, and if the
demurrer is sustained as to any of the three causes of action, those causes of
action will not be at issue during trial.” (Opp’n at p. 4:16-18.) But as
discussed, Enigma’s demurrer and motion to strike are currently set for hearing
on May 17, 2024, after the trial date currently scheduled for May 8, 2024. In
addition, as discussed, Enigma’s counsel states that “Enigma intends to move
for summary adjudication on multiple issues in the TAC or any later-amended
Complaint that Plaintiff may file.” (Ruttenberg Decl., ¶ 9.)[1] 
Based on the foregoing,
the Court finds that Enigma has demonstrated
good cause for a trial continuance. 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, Enigma’s motion is granted.
The Court continues the
final status conference to ______________, at 10:00 a.m., in Dept. 50 and trial
to _____________, at 9:30 a.m., in Dept. 50.
All discovery deadlines
are continued based on the new trial date. 
Enigma is ordered to give notice of this
ruling.
