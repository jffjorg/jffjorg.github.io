[1]In addition, as
set forth above, Code of Civil Procedure section 338, subdivision (d) provides, “[w]ithin
three years:…(d) An action for relief on the
ground of fraud or mistake. The cause of action in that case is not deemed to
have accrued until the discovery, by the aggrieved party, of the facts
constituting the fraud or mistake.”


[2]Plaintiffs allege
in the FAC that, inter alia, “[t]hrough 2016 and 2018, Defendant Kramer,
in person and over the phone, perpetrated a false narrative and fraudulently
represented that the Japanese crime syndicate was targeting the Dixons5 because
the property owner who owned the other 50 percent of the very valuable
Hollywood Property happened to be of Japanese descent. It was a malicious sham
meant to incite fear and paranoia in the Plaintiffs so that they would do
anything to protect themselves and their family, including relinquishing an
extremely valuable piece of property for a fraction of what it was worth.”
(FAC, ¶ 75.)
