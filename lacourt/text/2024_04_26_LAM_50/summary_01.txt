Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies Defendant Kramer's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The court finds that Kramer has not demonstrated that Plaintiffs' claims are time-barred. The court notes that the grant deed attached to Kramer's request for judicial notice does not clearly show that the Dixons' claims are barred. The court concludes that Plaintiffs' claims are not time-barred.
