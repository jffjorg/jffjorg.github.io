  ORDER RE:  
 
DEFENDANTS’
  MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS




AND RELATED CROSS-ACTION


 



 
Background
Plaintiffs Craig
L. Dixon (“Craig Dixon”); Kathleen Gay Dixon; Craig L. Dixon, Kathleen Gay
Dixon and Andrew Dixon, Trustees of the Restated Dixon Family Trust U/D/O April
23, 2014; Azalea Gardens; and Pioneer SG, LLC (collectively, “Plaintiffs”)
filed this action on October 13, 2020 against Defendants Frederick Kenneth
Kramer, a/k/a Kevin Dosh, Darren Kikuchi (“Kikuchi”), Cynthia Barron (“Barron”),
Joyce Cook (“Cook”), Betty Cannon (“Cannon”), Tony Wim Struyk, Lee Stein
(“Stein”), and Oakcrest Manor SD, Inc. 
On May 24, 2021, Plaintiffs filed the operative First Amended
Complaint (“FAC”). The FAC alleges causes of action for (1) financial elder
abuse, (2) financial elder abuse, 
(3)
fraud/fraud in the inducement, (4) rescission, (5) fraud, (6) aiding and
abetting fraud, 
(7)
breach of fiduciary duty, (8) recovery pursuant to Civil
Code section 1692, (9) unjust enrichment, (10) unjust enrichment, (11)
breach of contract, (12) breach of fiduciary duty, (13) conversion, (14)
constructive fraudulent nondisclosure, (15) constructive fraud, (16) an
accounting, (17) intentional infliction of emotional distress, (18) negligent
infliction of emotional distress, (19) declaratory relief, and (20) quiet
title. 
On July 12, 2021, Frederick Kenneth Kramer filed a Cross-Complaint
against Craig Dixon; Craig L. Dixon, Kathleen Gay Dixon and Andrew Dixon,
Trustees of the Restated Dixon Family Trust U/D/O April 23, 2014; Azalea
Gardens; and Pioneer SG, LLC. The Cross-Complaint alleges nine causes of
action. 
Frederick Kenneth Kramer (“Kramer”) now moves for judgment on the
pleadings as to portions of Plaintiffs’ FAC. Barron and Cook join in the
motion. Kikuchi, Cannon, and Stein also join in the motion. Plaintiffs oppose.  
Request for Judicial Notice 
The Court grants Kramer’s request for judicial notice as to the
existence of the grant deed attached as Exhibit A to the request. In Poseidon
Development, Inc. v. Woodland Lane Estates, LLC (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th
1106, 1117, cited by Kramer, the Court of Appeal noted that “[a] court may take judicial notice of something
that cannot reasonably be controverted, even if it negates an express
allegation of the pleading. This includes recorded deeds. However, the fact a court may take
judicial notice of a recorded deed, or similar document, does not mean it may
take judicial notice of factual matters stated therein.” (Internal citations
omitted.) 
Procedural Issues 
On March 18, 2024, the Court issued an order continuing the hearing on
the instant motion to April 26, 2024. The Court’s March 18, 2024 Order
provides, inter alia, that “the parties may file and serve opposition
and reply briefs per Code of Civil Procedure section
1005, subdivision (b), based on the continued hearing date. Kramer may file
a new reply brief that will supersede the previously filed reply papers.” (Order
at p. 4:6-8.) 
Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 1005, subdivision (b),
“[a]ll papers opposing a motion so noticed shall be filed with the court and a
copy served on each party at least nine court days, and all reply papers at
least five court days before the hearing.” The Court notes that nine court days
prior to the April 26, 2024 hearing is April 15, 2024. 
In
the reply, Kramer asserts that “[w]hile Plaintiffs filed their
opposition on April 5, 2024, they did not serve it. Counsel for Defendants
never received any copy of this Opposition. On April 16, 2024, having received
no opposition papers, counsel for Defendants asked counsel for Plaintiffs’
Opposition. In response, Plaintiffs email served counsel for Defendants a copy
of their filings for the first time and filed an Amended Proof of Service. The
proof of service on those served opposition papers confirms the tardy service.”
(Reply at p. 2:19-24.) Because Kramer received service of the opposition
(albeit one day late) and filed a substantive reply brief that addresses the arguments made in
Plaintiffs’ opposition, the Court elects to
exercise its discretion to consider the opposition. (Cal Rules of Court, rule 3.1300, subd. (d).)
Discussion 
A.   
Legal Standard 
A
motion for judgment on the pleadings has the same function as a general
demurrer but is made after the time for demurrer has expired. Except as
provided by ¿Code of Civil
Procedure section 438¿, the rules
governing demurrers apply. (¿Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp.
(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999¿.) A motion by a
defendant can be made on the ground that the complaint (or any cause of action
therein) “¿does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action against that defendant.¿” (¿Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd.
(c)(1)(B)(ii)¿.) Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 438, subdivision (d), “[t]he grounds for motion provided for in this section shall appear on
the face of the challenged pleading or from any matter of which the court is
required to take judicial notice.” 
¿“¿To survive a
demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of
action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the
plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.¿” (¿C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist.
(2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872¿.) For the
purpose of testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer
admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded. (¿Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist.
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967¿.) A demurrer “¿does not admit
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.¿” (¿Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d
695, 713¿.)
B.   
Relevant Allegations of
the FAC 
In the FAC, Plaintiffs allege, inter alia, that “[o]ver
the years, [Craig Dixon] and Kramer had an oral agreement where Kramer would
manage the properties acquired by the Dixons, and also managed the sales and
acquisitions of properties for the Dixons and their entities. In exchange,
Kramer, often through his entities, would be paid management fees from the sale
of the properties.” (FAC, ¶ 21.)
Plaintiffs allege, inter alia, that “[o]n or about June 15,
1998, at the urging of Kramer, [Craig Dixon] purchased a 50 percent interest in
a property at a tax sale for $39,051.32.” (FAC, ¶ 52.) This property is
“comprised of two vacant lots totaling a little more than two acres, or roughly
94,160 square feet. These lots are identified as Lots 44 and 56 of Tract No.
7842 in the City of Los Angeles (the ‘Hollywood Property’).” (FAC, ¶ 52.) “The
Assessor Parcel Numbers (‘APNs’) associated with these two lots are
5551-006-010 and 5551-006-017.” (FAC, ¶ 52.) “The other 50 percent interest was
owned by a man named Tsugitoshi Ishimoto (‘Hollywood Co-Owner’).” (FAC, ¶ 52.) 
Plaintiffs allege that “[i]n July 2014, the Dixons received an offer
to purchase both Hollywood parcels for $2,000,000 from a developer. This offer
included the other fifty percent interest not owned by the Dixons.” (FAC, ¶
53.) Plaintiffs allege that “[s]ometime around August 2015, Kramer told the
Dixons that Defendant Lee Stein was working on a partition sale with the
Hollywood Co-owner, who is Japanese. Later, Defendant Stein informed the Dixons
that he spoke to the Hollywood Co-Owner and that this co-owner and his partners
were getting anxious and threatening some type of legal action to separate the
property.” (FAC, ¶ 53.) 
Plaintiffs allege that “[s]ometime in November 2016, Kramer told the
Dixons in a phone call that the Hollywood Co-Owner is a member of the Japanese
Yakuza organized crime syndicate. He informed them that he believed this man
might be dangerous and Kramer had concern for everyone’s safety.” (FAC, ¶ 54.)
Plaintiffs allege that “[o]ver the course of the next eighteen months, Kramer
continued to ramp up the pressure that the Yakuza was targeting all of them –
especially the Dixons.” (FAC, ¶ 54.) Plaintiffs allege that “[h]e informed the
Dixons that Defendant Lee Stein’s elderly parents, who live close to the
Dixons, were assaulted at their front door by members of the Yakuza because Lee
was making inquiries into the ownership of the Hollywood Property. On another
call Kramer informed the Dixons that the Yakuza poisoned his Dalmatian dog.”
(FAC, ¶ 54.) 
Plaintiffs allege that “[i]n June 2017, upon the urgent recommendation
of Kramer, the Dixons sold their 50 percent interest in the Hollywood Property
to Defendant Kikuchi, Kramer’s trusted business partner, for the original price
they paid in 1998—$39,051.32. Kramer advised the Dixons to transfer ownership
to Defendant Kikuchi for safekeeping, as he was a martial arts instructor and
would be able to handle the threats from the Yakuza.” (FAC, ¶ 55.) Plaintiff
alleges that “[t]he Dixons were assured by Defendant Kramer, who was at the
time acting as an agent of Defendant Kikuchi and on his behalf, that they would
receive their property interests back when it was safe to do so, or upon the
sale of the Hollywood Property. By this time, the Dixons were terrified that
members of the Yakuza have targeted them.” (FAC, ¶ 55.) 
Plaintiffs allege that “[b]ased on tax records, it appears that
Defendant Kikuchi still owns the fifty percent interest in the Hollywood
Property that was taken from Plaintiffs.” (FAC, ¶ 57.) 
C.   
Statute of Limitations Argument

In the motion, Kramer asserts that “Plaintiffs’
claims for Fraud/Fraud in the Inducement, Rescission, Unjust Enrichment,
Fraudulent Non-Disclosure, Constructive Fraud, Intentional Infliction Of
Emotional Distress, Negligent Infliction Of Emotional Distress, and Declaratory
Relief related to the Hollywood Hills Property are time barred.” (Mot. at pp.
2:23-3:1.) 
Kramer asserts that “[i]nsofar as Plaintiffs’ claims sound in
fraud, the applicable statute of limitations is three years.” (Mot. at p. 5:9-10.)
Code of Civil Procedure section 338, subdivision (d)
provides, “[w]ithin three years:…(d) An action for relief on the ground of fraud or mistake. The cause
of action in that case is not deemed to have accrued until the discovery, by
the aggrieved party, of the facts constituting the fraud or mistake.” 
Kramer
also asserts that Plaintiffs’ declaratory relief cause of action
is subject to a three-year limitations period. Kramer cites North Star
Reinsurance Corp. v. Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1815, 1822, where the Court of Appeal
noted that “it is the rule
that the statute of limitations governing a request for declaratory relief
is the one applicable to an ordinary legal or equitable action based on the
same claim.” (Internal quotations omitted.) 
Kramer argues that “Plaintiffs’
claims for rescission and unjust enrichment are subject to a two-year
limitations period. These claims are subject to a two-year limitations period
because the agreement between Kramer and Dixon related to the return of the
Hollywood Hills Property (i.e. Kramer would transfer the property back to Dixon
once it was ‘safe to do so’) was allegedly made orally.” (Mot. at p. 5:16-19.)
Kramer cites Code of Civil Procedure section 339(1)
which provides, inter alia, “[w]ithin two
years: 1. An action upon a contract, obligation or liability not founded
upon an instrument of writing…” ((Id., § 339.) 
Kramer asserts that Plaintiffs’
emotional distress claims are subject to a two-year statute of limitations.
Kramer cites to Wassmann v. South Orange County Community College
Dist. (2018)
24 Cal.App.5th 825, 852-853, where the Court of Appeal noted that “[i]ntentional infliction of emotional distress has a
two-year statute of limitations.” (Citing Code
Civ. Proc., § 335.1.) 
As discussed above, the FAC alleges that as to the Hollywood Property,
“[t]he Assessor Parcel Numbers (‘APNs’) associated with [the] two lots are
5551-006-010 and 5551-006-017.” (FAC, ¶ 52.) The FAC also alleges, as
discussed, that “[t]he other 50 percent interest was owned by a man named
Tsugitoshi Ishimoto (‘Hollywood Co-Owner’),” and that “Kramer told the Dixons
in a phone call that the Hollywood Co-Owner is a member of the Japanese Yakuza
organized crime syndicate.” (FAC, ¶¶ 52, 54) 
In the motion, Kramer asserts that “Mr. Ishimoto, the alleged Yakuza
member, owned his interest in the Hollywood Hills Property until March 7, 2017,
when he sold it.” (Mot. at p. 3:22-23.) In support of this assertion, Kramer
cites to Exhibit “A” to his request for judicial notice. Exhibit “A” includes a
“Grant Deed” indicating, inter alia, that “FOR A VALUABLE CONSIDERATION,
receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, Tsugitoshi Ishimoto, a Married Man, as
his sole and separate property, as to his entire undivided 50% interest hereby GRANT(s)
to: Pierre Yaralian, A Married Man, as his sole and separate property… the real
property in the City of Los Angeles, County of Los Angeles, State of
California, described as: LEGAL DESCRIPTION ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT ‘A’ AND
MADE A PART HEREOF Also Known as: Vacant Land - APN 5551-006-010 and 5551-006-017,
Los Angeles, CA 90046...” (Kramer’s RJN, Ex. A.) This Grant Deed is dated March
7, 2017. (Ibid.) 
Kramer asserts that the “[t]he deed for Mr. Ishimoto’s sale was
recorded on August 10, 2017.” (Mot. at p. 3:23-24, citing Kramer’s RJN, Ex. A.)
Kramer argues that “the fact Mr. Ishimoto, a supposed member of the Yakuza, no
longer owned the property at issue was known publicly the date the sale was
recorded…The result is at that time, Dr. Dixon was on notice the ‘danger’ had
passed and the property would be returned to him, as alleged in the FAC.” (Mot.
at p. 3:24-27.) Kramer notes
that the FAC alleges that “[t]he Dixons were assured by Defendant
Kramer, who was at the time acting as an agent of Defendant Kikuchi and on his
behalf, that they would receive their property interests back when it was safe
to do so, or upon the sale of the Hollywood Property.” (FAC, ¶ 55.) Kramer
contends that “[b]ecause Dr. Dixon filed his Complaint over three years after
this publicly known sale, the majority of the claims are time-barred.” (Mot. at
p. 6:2-3.) 
As an initial matter, as noted by Plaintiffs in the opposition, the
motion improperly targets portions of causes of action. In Olson v.
Hornbrook Community Services Dist. (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 502, 522,
footnote 9, cited by Plaintiffs, the Court of Appeal noted that “a general demurrer may not be sustained, nor a motion for
judgment on the pleadings granted, as to a portion of a cause of action, but
that portion may be attacked by filing a motion to strike.” (Internal
quotations omitted.) 
As discussed, Kramer seeks judgment on “Plaintiffs’ claims for
Fraud/Fraud in the Inducement (Count 3), Rescission (Counts 4 and 8), Unjust
Enrichment (Count 9), Fraudulent Non-Disclosure (Count 14), Constructive Fraud
(Count 15), Intentional Infliction Of Emotional Distress (Count 17), Negligent
Infliction Of Emotional Distress (Count 18), and Declaratory Relief (Count 19)
with respect to the Hollywood Hills Property...” (Mot. at pp. 9:25-10:2.) However,
as noted by Plaintiffs, the third, fifteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth
causes of action are not limited to allegations involving the Hollywood
Property, but are “premised on multiple different sets of factual allegations.”
(Opp’n at p. 8:7-8; see, e.g. FAC, ¶¶ 73, 74, 78, 147, 154, 155, 161,
162, 164, 167, 169, 170.) 
In addition, the Court does not find that Kramer has demonstrated that
the causes of action at issue are untimely. 
In the motion,
Kramer argues that “Plaintiffs’ various causes of [sic] with
respect to the Hollywood Hills Property sound in fraud.” (Mot. at p. 5:1.) Plaintiffs
note that “[a] cause of action based upon fraud,
actual or constructive, does not accrue until the aggrieved party discovers the
fraud.” (Ornbaun
v. Main (1961) 198 Cal.App.2d 92,
100 (internal citation omitted).)[1] As noted by Plaintiffs, the
FAC alleges that “[i]t was not until late 2019, early 2020, that the
Plaintiffs’ son and daughter in law, upon hearing from the Plaintiffs what they
had been going through, did they start to investigate and uncover the series of
lies and fraud perpetrated by the Defendants against the Plaintiffs. Up until
that point, for many years, the Plaintiffs, relying on their longstanding
relationship and trust in the Defendants were completely unaware that this
wrongful conduct was occurring and causing them significant financial and
emotional harm.” (FAC, ¶ 58.)
In addition, as noted by Plaintiffs, “[i]t
is difficult for demurrers based on the statute of limitations to succeed
because (1) trial and appellate courts treat the demurrer as admitting all
material facts properly pleaded and (2) resolution of the statute of
limitations issue can involve questions of fact. Furthermore, when the relevant
facts are not clear such that the cause of action might be, but is not
necessarily, time-barred, the demurrer will be overruled…Thus, for a demurrer
based on the statute of limitations to be sustained, the untimeliness of the
lawsuit must clearly and affirmatively appear on the face of the complaint and
matters judicially noticed.”
(Schmier
v. City of Berkeley (2022) 76
Cal.App.5th 549, 554.) 
Plaintiffs
assert that here, “the grant deed attached to Kramer’s request
for judicial notice hardly ‘clearly’ or ‘affirmatively’ shows that the Dixons’
claims are barred.” (Opp’n at p. 11:27-28.) The Court agrees. As Plaintiffs
note, “Kramer’s theory based on the grant deed appears to be that the Dixons
(1) should have found the deed in the public record, (2) should have noticed
that Mr. Ishimoto transferred his interest to one Pierre Yaralian, (3) should
have assumed (without any support) that this transfer was unrelated to the
Yakuza, (4) should have inferred that the Yakuza was therefore no longer
involved with the Hollywood Hills Property (again, Kramer does not explain why
this should have been apparent to the Dixons), (5) should have believed that
the danger from the Yakuza had ‘passed,’ (6) should have assumed that the
Hollywood Hills Property would have been returned to them, (7) should have
confronted Kramer when the property was not returned to them, and (8) therefore
should have realized that Kramer is a fraudster.” (Opp’n at p. 12:1-9.) The
Court does not see how the existence of the subject grant deed shows that
Plaintiffs knew that “the alleged threat of imminent harm vanished at the time
of Mr. Ishimoto’s sale,” (Mot. at p. 7:24) and that Plaintiffs should have
somehow known at that time that Kramer allegedly fraudulently represented that
the Yakuza was targeting Plaintiffs.[2]  
Conclusion
Based on the
foregoing, the Court denies Kramer’s motion for judgment on the pleadings. 
Plaintiffs are
ordered to give notice of this order.¿
