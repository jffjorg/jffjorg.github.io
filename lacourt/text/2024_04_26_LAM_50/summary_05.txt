Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint for damages and for demand for jury trial is denied. The plaintiff had filed a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint, but the motion was denied without prejudice on February 28, 2024. The plaintiff then filed a notice of errata and an amended & corrected refiling of the notice of errata, but did not file a revised motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. The court has noted that the plaintiff failed to comply with the rules of court by not filing a notice of hearing on the motion and a memorandum in support of the motion. As a result, the court has denied the purported motion set for hearing on April 26, 2024.
