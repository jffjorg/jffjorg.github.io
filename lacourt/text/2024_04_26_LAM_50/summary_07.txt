This is a tentative ruling from Judge Teresa A. Beaudet regarding a motion to strike parts of Plaintiff Christopher Castro's Complaint. The Plaintiff filed a lawsuit against Defendant Dongalen Enterprises, Inc. d/b/a Interstate Plastics alleging causes of action for disability discrimination, failure to provide reasonable accommodation, and other claims. The Defendant moved to strike parts of the Complaint, and the Plaintiff opposes this motion. The Judge notes that the Defendant's counsel did not demonstrate that the parties met and conferred in person, by telephone, or by video conference as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 435.5. The Judge orders the Defendant to meet and confer with the Plaintiff within 10 days and to file a declaration setting forth the efforts to meet and confer if the parties are unable to resolve the issues. The hearing on the Defendant's motion to strike is continued to a later date.
