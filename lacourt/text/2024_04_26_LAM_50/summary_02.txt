And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling discusses the case involving Plaintiffs and Defendant Kramer. The Plaintiffs allege that Kramer perpetrated a false narrative and fraudulently represented that a Japanese crime syndicate was targeting the Dixons because the property owner who owned the other 50% of the valuable Hollywood Property was of Japanese descent. The ruling references Code of Civil Procedure section 338, subdivision (d), which states that an action for relief on the ground of fraud or mistake is not deemed to have accrued until the discovery, by the aggrieved party, of the facts constituting the fraud or mistake. The court notes that Kramer's actions were a malicious sham meant to incite fear and paranoia in the Plaintiffs, causing them to relinquish a valuable piece of property for a fraction of its worth.
