Fidelity National Title Co. (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 486, 493, where the Court of Appeal noted that “[t]he function of the pleadings in a motion
for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues…and to frame the
outer measure of materiality in a summary judgment proceeding…Accordingly, the
burden of a defendant moving for summary judgment only requires that he or she
negate plaintiff’s theories of liability as alleged in the complaint; that is, a moving party need not refute liability on some
theoretical possibility not included in the pleadings.” (Internal quotations,
citations, and emphasis omitted.)
