And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted Enigma's motion to continue the trial date in this action. The court finds that Enigma has demonstrated good cause for a trial continuance, citing the need for the pleadings to be at issue, the need for the parties to complete discovery, and Enigma's intention to move for summary adjudication on multiple issues in the operative Third Amended Complaint. The court has continued the final status conference to a later date and trial to a later date. All discovery deadlines have been continued based on the new trial date. Enigma is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
