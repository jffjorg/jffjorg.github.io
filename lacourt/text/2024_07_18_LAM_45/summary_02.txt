And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling concerns a motion to compel the deposition of the Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK) for Defendant American Honda Motor Co. Inc. (AHMC) in a lemon-law action filed by Plaintiffs Jose Maurico Iniguez and Maribel Balderas Estrada. The Court finds that AHMC failed to appear at a scheduled PMK deposition and did not engage in meaningful meet and confer efforts to schedule an alternative date. As a result, the Court grants the motion to compel and orders the parties to meet and confer to schedule a mutually agreeable deposition date. The Court also awards Plaintiffs sanctions in the amount of $3,195.00, to be paid by AHMC and Defense Counsel jointly and severally.
