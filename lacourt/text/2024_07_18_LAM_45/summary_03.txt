And here is the summary text:

The Judge has denied Defendant McDonald’s USA, LLC's Motion to Seal documents related to their previous Motion for Attorney's Fees. The Judge found that the Defendant's interest in sealing the documents, which contained references to its special billing rates for its client, was not sufficient to overcome the public's right of access to court proceedings. The Judge noted that the Defendant's billing rates were not a sufficient reason to seal the documents and that the public has a constitutional right to access court proceedings.
