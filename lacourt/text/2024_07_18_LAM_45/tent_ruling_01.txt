Background
Plaintiffs Keegan Davis, Jerry Davis, and Kimberly Penny filed
this action on December 21, 2021 against defendants Prime Healthcare Services -
St. Francis, LLC dba St. Francis Medical Center (“Defendant” or “St. Francis
Medical Center”) and Elite Funerals and Cremation Center of California (“Elite
Funerals”), alleging (1) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; (2)
Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress; (3) General Negligence; (4) Fraud;
(5) Breach of Fiduciary Duty; (6) Breach of Contract; (7) Breach of Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; (8)
Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress (against St. Francis Medical
Center); and (9) General Negligence (against St. Francis Medical Center). The
Complaint alleges that Andrew Kirksey (“Decedent”) died on August 22, 2020
while a patient at St. Francis Medical Center. (Compl., ¶ 13.) While alive and
a patient at St. Francis Medical Center, respiratory equipment to aid breathing
was used to aid Decedent’s breathing. (Id.) Plaintiffs allege that St.
Francis Medical Center failed to properly prepare Decedent’s body for transport
to Elite Funerals by failing to remove “a medical device attached to both
cheeks.” (Id. at ¶¶ 72, 80.) When the breathing apparatus was removed by
the Mortician at Evins Funeral Home, it caused the skin on both cheeks to peel
off leaving large light complexion spots on Decedent’s face. (Id.)
Defendant St. Francis Medical Center now
moves for summary judgment pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure
Section 437c. Defendant alternatively moves for summary adjudication of the
following issues, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 437c(f)(1): There
is no triable issue of material fact as to Plaintiffs’ eighth cause of action
for negligent infliction of emotional distress against Defendant. No opposition
has been filed as of July 15, 2024. 
 
Legal
Standard
“The purpose of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts
with a mechanism to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine
whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their
dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826,
843.) Code of Civil Procedure section 437c(c) “requires the trial judge to
grant summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences
reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences
or evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and
that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of
the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the
issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether
there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the
pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67,
citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367,
381-382.)
As to each cause of action as framed by the complaint, a defendant
moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication must satisfy the initial
burden of proof by presenting facts to show “that one or more elements of the
cause of action ... cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense
to the cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar,
supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp. 850-851; Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc.
(2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Courts “liberally construe the evidence in
support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning
the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc.
(2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
Once the defendant has met that burden, the burden shifts to the
plaintiff to show that a “triable issue of one or more material facts exists as
to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd.
(p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp. 850-851.) To establish a
triable issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce
substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)

Discussion
            Defendant moves for summary judgment on the grounds
that there is no triable issue of material fact in this action as to the care
and treatment rendered to Decedent by Defendant and at all times relative to
this action, Defendant’s care and treatment of Plaintiff complied with the
applicable standard of care. Moreover, to a reasonable degree of medical
probability, there was no act or omission on the part of Defendant which caused
or contributed to Plaintiffs’ injuries. Defendant alternatively
moves for summary adjudication of the following issues: There is no triable
issue of material fact as to Plaintiffs’ eighth cause of action for negligent
infliction of emotional distress against Defendant.
Negligence 
In
a medical negligence action, a plaintiff must establish the following elements:
“(1) the duty of the professional to use such skill, prudence, and diligence as
other members of [the] profession commonly possess and exercise; (2) a breach
of that duty; (3) a proximate causal connection between the negligent conduct
and the resulting injury; and (4) actual loss or damage resulting from the
professional’s negligence.” (Galvez v. Frields (2001) 88 Cal.App.4tha
1410, 1420; Simmons v. West Covina Medical Clinic (1989) 212 Cal.App.3d
696, 701-02.) “Both the standard of care and defendants’ breach must normally
be established by expert testimony in a medical malpractice case.” (Avivi v.
Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008), 159 Cal.App.4th 463, 467.) 
A
medical professional breaches the duty of professional care by failing to act
in accordance with the prevailing industry standard of care. (See Folk v.
Kilk (1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 176, 186.) “The standard of care against which
the acts of a physician are to be measured is a matter peculiarly within the
knowledge of experts; it presents the basic issue in a malpractice action and
can only be proved by their testimony …, unless the conduct required by the
particular circumstances is within the common knowledge of the layman.’” (Landeros
v. Flood (1976) 17 Cal.3d 399, 410.) 
A
defendant moving for summary judgment in a medical malpractice action must
“present evidence that would preclude a reasonable trier of fact from finding
that it was more likely than not that their treatment fell below the standard
of care.” (Johnson v. Super. Ct. (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 297, 305.) “When
a defendant moves for summary judgment and supports [the] motion with expert
declarations that [their] conduct fell within the community standard of care,
[the defendant] is entitled to summary judgment unless the plaintiff comes
forward with conflicting expert evidence.” (Munro v. Regents of University
of California (1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 977, 984-985.) An expert declaration,
if uncontradicted, is conclusive proof as to the prevailing standard of care
and the propriety of the particular conduct of the health care provider. (Starr
v. Mooslin (1971) 14 Cal.App.3d 988, 999.)
Here,
Defendant presents the declaration of Daniel Luthringer, M.D. (Dr. Luthringer”)
in support of Defendant’s motion. Dr. Luthringer is a physician duly licensed
to practice medicine in the State of California who has been certified by the
National Board of Medical Examiners, American Board of Pathology in Anatomic
Pathology and American Board of Pathology in Cytopathology at all times
relevant to this case. (Declaration of Daniel Luthringer, M.D., ¶ 1.) Dr.
Luthringer has been a Staff Pathologist and Co-Director Autopsy Service,
Department of Pathology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles,
California since 1992. Dr. Luthringer has also been a Deputy Coroner in Los
Angeles County since 1992. (Luthringer Decl., ¶ 3.) Based upon his background,
education, training and experience in the field of pathology, Dr. Luthringer is
familiar with the care to deceased patients admitted to acute care hospitals. (Id.,
¶ 4.)
            Dr. Luthringer has
reviewed Plaintiffs’ Complaint, Consumer Complaint Statement and Decedent’s
records from St. Francis Medical Center and Evins Funeral Home. (Id., ¶
6.) Dr. Luthringer recounts the following. 
Decedent
was a resident of Greenfield Nursing Home. On August 22, 2020, he was found
unresponsive by staff. CPR was initiated and emergency medical services (“EMS”)
was dispatched at 1:31 p.m. Decedent was taken to the Emergency Department at
St. Francis Medical Center via EMS. Spontaneous circulation was achieved prior
to arrival but Decedent was pronounced dead at 2:23 p.m. at St. Francis Medical
Center. (Id., ¶ 8.)
On
August 22, 2020, Keegan Davis was contacted by the hospital to make
arrangements for transporting Decedent’s body to a mortuary. Mr. Davis arranged
for Defendant Elite Funerals to take possession of the body from St. Francis
Medical Center. Defendant Elite Funerals picked up Decedent’s body from St.
Francis Medical Center on August 24, 2020. (Id., ¶ 9.)
On
August 27, 2020, Mr. Davis became upset with Elite Funerals and hired Evins
Funeral Home to prepare Decedent’s body for a funeral. However, Elite Funerals
refused to release Decedent’s body until they were compensated for their
services. (Id., ¶ 10.)
On
September 1, 2020, Evins Funeral Home took possession of Decedent’s body.
Decedent allegedly had begun to decompose due to lack of refrigeration and
embalming at Elite Funerals. A “medical device” (likely the breathing apparatus
from when EMS and the physicians tried to revive Decedent) was attached to
Decedent’s facial cheeks. A significant part of the cheek skin peeled away when
the device was removed by Evins Funeral Home staff. The funeral was on
September 15, 2020. (Id., ¶ 11.)
Based
on the materials reviewed, as well as his background, education, experience and
training, it is Dr. Luthringer’s expert opinion that St. Francis Medical Center
met the standard of care at all times during their care of Decedent. (Id.,
¶ 12.) Decedent's body was stored in the morgue and released to Elite Funerals.
The standard of care does not require an acute care hospital to remove
breathing devices from a deceased patient. (Id., ¶ 13.)
This
is “evidence which, if uncontradicted, would constitute a preponderance of
evidence that an essential element of the plaintiff’s case cannot be
established.” (Kids’ Universe v. In2Labs (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 870,
879.) The expert opinion testimony of Dr. Luthringer is evidence that Defendant
complied with the standard of care at all times during its care of Decedent. 
With
this evidence, Defendant has satisfied its initial burden of showing that one
or more elements of Plaintiffs’ case cannot be established. (Code Civ. Proc., §
437c, subd. (p)(2).) This shifts the burden to Plaintiffs  to show that there is a triable issue of one
or more material facts as to the causes of action. (Id.) Plaintiffs have
not filed an opposition or other evidence making this showing. Therefore,
Defendant is entitled to summary judgment. 
NIED
“[The] negligent
causing of emotional distress is not an independent tort but the tort of
negligence . . .¿ The traditional elements of duty, breach of duty, causation,
and damages apply. Whether a defendant owes a duty of care is a question of
law. Its existence depends upon the foreseeability of the risk and upon a
weighing of policy considerations for and against imposition of liability.” (Marlene
F. v. Affiliated Psychiatric Medical Clinic, Inc. (1989) 48 Cal.3d 583,
588, internal citations omitted.)¿ 
Here, because summary
judgment is granted as to Plaintiffs’ negligence cause of action, Plaintiffs’
claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress cannot be sustained.

            Accordingly,
Defendant Prime Healthcare Services – St. Francis, LLC DBA St. Francis Medical
Center’s Motion for Summary Judgement is GRANTED. 
 
            It
is so ordered.
