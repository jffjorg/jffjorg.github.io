I.       
Defendant
GENERAL MOTORS LLC’s Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint is OFF-CALENDAR
as MOOT. 
 
   
II.       
Defendant
GENERAL MOTORS LLC’s Motion to Strike Portions of Plaintiff’s Complaint is OFF-CALENDAR
as MOOT. 
 
Moving
Party to give notice. 

No Opposition filed as of February 20, 2024.   


Defendant
GENERAL MOTORS LLC generally demurs and moves to strike portions of Plaintiff’s
Complaint. 
 
“A
party may amend its pleading once without leave of court at any time before the
answer, demurrer, or motion to strike is filed, or after a demurrer or motion
to strike is filed but before the demurrer or motion to strike is heard if
the amended pleading is filed and served no later than the date for filing an
opposition to the demurrer or motion to strike.” (emphasis added.) (CCP
§472.)  
 
The
subject Demurrer was filed on September 6, 2023, and the hearing is set for February
22, 2024. Plaintiffs’ Opposition was supposed to be filed and served by no
later than February 7, 2024. (CCP §1005(b).) 
 
Plaintiff’s
First Amended Complaint was filed without leave of Court on February 16, 2024. 
 
It
is well-settled that California recognizes “a general rule of…liberal allowance
of amendments…” (Nestle v. City of Santa Monica (1972) 6 Cal.3d 920,
939.) In the interests of judicial efficiency and in light of the liberal
policy concerning amendments, the Court utilizes its discretion to permit the
filing of the First Amended Complaint on February 16, 2024. The First Amended
Complaint is the operative pleading, and the Demurrer and Motion to Strike are
placed OFF-CALENDAR as MOOT.
