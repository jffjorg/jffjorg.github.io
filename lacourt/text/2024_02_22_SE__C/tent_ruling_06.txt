CHARBONNET
CASE NO.:  23NWCV01617
HEARING:  02/22/24
 
#3
 
Plaintiff’s unopposed Motion to Deem RFA (set one) Admitted as
to Defendant ALLEN JOSEPH CHARBONNET, SR. is GRANTED. 
 
Moving Party to give Notice. 
 
No Opposition filed as of February 20, 2024.  
 
The unopposed Motion to Deem Matters Admitted as to Defendant
ALLEN JOSEPH CHARBONNET, SR. is GRANTED. 
 
“If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: (a) The party to
whom the requests for admission are directed waives any objection to the
requests…. The Court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its
determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The
party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with
Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230. (2) the party’s failure to serve a
timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect….
(c) The court shall make this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the
requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the
motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in
substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. It is mandatory that the court
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7…on the party or attorney, or both,
whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated
this motion.” (CCP §2033.280.) 
Unverified responses “are tantamount to no responses at all.” (Appleton
v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.) No prior attempt to
resolve the matter informally is required. 
 
Here, RFAs were propounded on or about August 9, 2023. 
 
To the Court’s knowledge, Defendant has failed to provide
any responses. Therefore, the unopposed Motion is GRANTED. 
 
Sanctions are mandatory pursuant to the terms of CCP
§2033.280(c). Sanctions are awarded as requested. Defendant ALLEN JOSEPH
CHARBONNET, SR. and his counsel of record are jointly and severally ORDERED to pay Plaintiff and their counsel
of record sanctions in the total amount requested of $1,856.25 no later than
30 days from the Court’s issuance of this Order. This date may be extended
by agreement of the parties.
