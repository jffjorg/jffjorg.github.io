And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint and motion to strike portions of the complaint are no longer relevant and are considered "off-calendar" or "moot". This is because the plaintiff filed a first amended complaint without leave of court on February 16, 2024, which is the operative pleading. The court has exercised its discretion to permit the filing of the first amended complaint, citing the liberal policy concerning amendments in California. Since the demurrer and motion to strike were filed before the first amended complaint, they are now moot and the court will not consider them further.
