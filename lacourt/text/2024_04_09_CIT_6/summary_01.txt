And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motions to be relieved as counsel by Stephen J. Thomas, counsel for the defendants, and has granted the motions, but with certain conditions. The court has found that there has been a complete breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, which is a sufficient ground for allowing the attorney to withdraw. However, the court notes that the proposed orders submitted by counsel are incomplete and requires revision. Therefore, the court has ordered counsel to submit revised proposed orders and to file proofs of service of the same upon the defendants.
