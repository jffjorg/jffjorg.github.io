**Tentative Ruling**

Case Number: 22TRCV00550

The court has considered the motions to compel discovery responses filed by Airport Urgent Care & Industrial Medicine (Airport) against Pacific Medical Laboratory, Reza Zarghami, Jalal Zarghami, and Suzan Asilzadeh Dardashti (cross-defendants). The motions seek to compel cross-defendants to serve responses to four sets of discovery requests, including form interrogatories, requests for admission, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents.

The court finds that cross-defendants failed to serve timely responses to the discovery requests, but they did serve untimely verifications. The court also notes that Airport improperly filed the motions as a single motion, rather than filing separate motions for each discovery request.

The court DENIES the motions to compel discovery responses, except for the request for sanctions, which is also DENIED. The court finds that the motions are moot with the exception of sanctions, since cross-defendants have already served verified responses and production.

The court ORDERS Airport to pay 17 filing fees to the court forthwith. The parties are also ORDERED to make an effort to meet and confer verbally prior to bringing any further discovery motions to facilitate a productive resolution of any discovery disputes.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving Account Management Services, Inc. (AMS) and several defendants, including Jamshid J. Shariati, M.D., Airport Urgent Care & Industrial Medicine, and others. AMS had filed a complaint against the defendants, and the defendants had cross-complained against AMS. The case involves a dispute over discovery requests, and AMS has moved to compel the defendants to provide responses to those requests.

The judge has denied AMS's motions to compel, finding that the defendants had already provided verified responses to the discovery requests prior to the filing of the motions. The judge also found that the defendants' responses were not untimely, despite being subject to a meet and confer correspondence from AMS. The judge noted that AMS had filed 18 motions as one paying only one motion fee, and ordered AMS to pay 17 filing fees to the court forthwith.

The judge also ordered the parties to make an effort to meet and confer verbally prior to bringing any further discovery motions to facilitate a productive resolution of any discovery dispute. Finally, the judge denied AMS's request for sanctions against the defendants, finding that AMS had not incurred any fees in preparing the motions since the defendants had already provided verified responses.

* Plaintiff: ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT SERVICES, INC.
* Defendant: JAMSHID J. SHARIATI, M.D. a/k/a JAMES J. SHARIATI, M.D. (Shariati); AIRPORT URGENT CARE & INDUSTRIAL MEDICINE, a California corporation; and DOES 1 through 10, inclusive (Cross-Defendants)

**Background**

* On July 5, 2022, plaintiff Account Management Services, Inc. ("AMS") filed a complaint against defendants Shariati, Airport Urgent Care & Industrial Medicine, and Does 1-10 for common counts.
* On October 31, 2022, Shariati and Airport (Cross-Complainants) filed a cross-complaint against Pacific Medical Laboratory ("PML"), Reza Zarghami ("Reza"), Jalal Zarghami ("Jalal"), and Suzan Asilzadeh Dardashti ("Dardashi") (Cross-Defendants) for breach of oral contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, negligence, and destruction of goodwill.

**Motions**

* Four discovery motions are before the court: motions to compel initial responses to First Set of Form Interrogatories, First Set of Requests for Admission, First Set of Special Interrogatories, and First Set of Request for Production of Documents.
* Airport moves for orders compelling each of the four cross-defendants to provide responses to the discovery requests.
* Airport requests an award of monetary sanctions against cross-defendants in the total amount of $5,925.00.

**Ruling**

* The court finds that the motions are moot in part, as verified responses and production occurred prior to the filing of the motion, with the exception of sanctions.
* The court denies the motions to compel initial responses to the discovery requests, as the subject motions are moot.
* The court denies the motion to deem requests for admissions admitted, as there is no statutory authority for a motion to compel responses to requests for admission.

* The court advises counsel for Airport to file separate motions and pay separate filing fees for any discovery motions in the future.

* Request for Admissions: CCP §2033.280(b), Weil & Brown, Civ. Proc. Before Trial, ¶ 8:1370, citing CCP §2033.280(b)

**Discussion**

* Airport contends that cross-defendants failed to serve timely responses to its discovery requests and that the responses were untimely because they were unverified and therefore non-code compliant.
* The court finds that cross-defendants produced responses and untimely verifications, and that there is no production to compel.
* The court denies Airport's motions to compel cross-defendants' responses to special interrogatories, form interrogatories, and requests for production.
* The court denies Airport's motion to deem RFAs admitted against cross-defendants.

**Plaintiff:** Account Management Services, Inc.

**Defendants:** Jamshid J. Shariati, M.D. aka James J. Shariati, M.D., Airport Urgent Care & Industrial Medicine, a Professional Corporation, and Does 1 through 10, inclusive.

**Dispute:** Four cross-defendants have been requested to provide initial responses to four sets of discovery requests, including Form Interrogatories, Requests for Admission, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Production of Documents.
