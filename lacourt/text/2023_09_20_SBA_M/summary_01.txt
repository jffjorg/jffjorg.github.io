**Tentative Ruling**

Case Number: 22TRCV00550

The court has considered the motions to compel discovery responses filed by Airport Urgent Care & Industrial Medicine (Airport) against Pacific Medical Laboratory, Reza Zarghami, Jalal Zarghami, and Suzan Asilzadeh Dardashti (cross-defendants). The motions seek to compel cross-defendants to serve responses to four sets of discovery requests, including form interrogatories, requests for admission, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents.

The court finds that cross-defendants failed to serve timely responses to the discovery requests, but they did serve untimely verifications. The court also notes that Airport improperly filed the motions as a single motion, rather than filing separate motions for each discovery request.

The court DENIES the motions to compel discovery responses, except for the request for sanctions, which is also DENIED. The court finds that the motions are moot with the exception of sanctions, since cross-defendants have already served verified responses and production.

The court ORDERS Airport to pay 17 filing fees to the court forthwith. The parties are also ORDERED to make an effort to meet and confer verbally prior to bringing any further discovery motions to facilitate a productive resolution of any discovery disputes.
