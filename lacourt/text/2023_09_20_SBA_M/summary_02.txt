And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the motion to quash service of summons is denied. The plaintiff, Samuel Tafolla, filed a complaint against the defendants, Darren John Marcz and Does 1 to 50, for motor vehicle and negligence. The defendants claim that the service of summons is defective due to lack of personal jurisdiction, as they were unlikely to receive actual notice of the summons. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant provided his mother's residence as his address on the face page of the traffic collision report and that he lived with his mother briefly in December 2022. The judge finds that the defendant has a strong connection with his mother's residence and that the service of summons by substituted service on his mother was proper. The judge relies on CCP ยง 415.20(b) and previous cases such as Zirbes v. Stratton and Corcoran v. Arouh to reach this decision.
