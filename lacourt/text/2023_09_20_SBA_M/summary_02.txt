And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the motion to quash service of summons is denied. The plaintiff, Samuel Tafolla, filed a complaint against the defendants, Darren John Marcz and Does 1 to 50, for motor vehicle and negligence. The defendants claim that the service of summons is defective due to lack of personal jurisdiction, as they were unlikely to receive actual notice of the summons. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant provided his mother's residence as his address on the face page of the traffic collision report and that he lived with his mother briefly in December 2022. The judge finds that the defendant has a strong connection with his mother's residence and that the service of summons by substituted service on his mother was proper. The judge relies on CCP § 415.20(b) and previous cases such as Zirbes v. Stratton and Corcoran v. Arouh to reach this decision.

**English Summary:**

The judge issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to quash service of summons. 

The defendant argued that he was not properly served because he was homeless or in a mental health facility at the time, and his mother's address was not his actual residence. However, the judge found that the plaintiff presented sufficient evidence to show that the defendant had a strong connection to his mother's residence, including his own driver's license listing that address and a Westlaw search showing he resided there from 1988 to 2023.  Additionally, the defendant briefly lived with his mother in December 2022. Because the defendant had a connection to the address, the judge ruled that substituted service on his mother was valid.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to quash the service of summons. The defendant, Darren John Marcz, had argued that the service of summons was defective because he had not received actual notice of the summons due to his homelessness and mental health issues. However, the plaintiff, Samuel Tafolla, presented evidence that the defendant had listed his mother's address as his residence in the collision report and on his driver's license. The judge found that this established a connection between the defendant and his mother's residence, which was sufficient to validate the service of summons. The judge cited relevant case law, including Zirbes v. Stratton and Corcoran v. Arouh, to support the decision. The defendant's motion was denied, and the case will proceed with the defendant being required to respond to the complaint.
