    - CUGA's evidence shows that the representations and warranties in the SPA were not false when made
    - Landec's evidence shows that Yucatan knowingly discharged its wastewater into the Silao river illegally
    - Triable issues of material fact exist regarding the breach of contract claims

  - Issue 4: Equitable Indemnity

    - Landec's evidence shows that Yucatan knowingly discharged its wastewater into the Silao river illegally, so equitable indemnity may be applicable
