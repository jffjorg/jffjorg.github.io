BACKGROUND
 
On February 2, 2020, Plaintiff Ardeshir Haerizadeh (“Haerizadeh”), the
founder of Yucatan Foods, brought suit against Defendants Landec Corporation and
Apio Inc. (collectively, “Landec” or “Defendants”), who acquired Yucatan Foods,
alleging four causes of action for (1) breach of employment contract; (2) breach
of holdback agreement; (3) declaratory relief (as to whether the non-compete
provisions in the Employment Agreement are enforceable in light of Plaintiff’s
termination without cause); and (4) accounting. 

 
On November 3, 2020, Landec brought a cross-complaint against
Cross-Defendants Haerizadeh, Dan Walton, Warren Schlichting, Robert Hall,
Sepand Riahi, Allen Lance Mcinnes, John Barber, Michael F. Baxter, Doug Harmon,
George H. Davis Jr., Adam Cardenas, Kevin Gay, Aaron Morris, J.F. Shea Co.,
Inc. as Nominee 1996-1, and Desarrollos Inmobiliarios Cuga, S.A.P.I. de C.V. (“CUGA”)
alleging seven causes of action for (1) fraud; (2) fraudulent inducement; (3)
civil conspiracy; (4) contractual indemnity; (5) breach of contract; (6)
equitable indemnity; and (7) unjust enrichment.
 
CUGA now moves for summary judgment, or in the alternative, summary
adjudication on the following issues:
 
1. The third cause of action against CUGA in the
Cross-Complaint for civil conspiracy fails because CUGA did not participate in
any civil conspiracy; and such claim is barred by the agent’s immunity rule; 
 
2. The fourth cause of action against CUGA in the
Cross-Complaint for breach of contractual indemnity fails because: 1) the
operative contract prevents LANDEC from pursuing such claim unless and until it
has recovered a requisite amount of damages from other named cross-defendants,
an event which has not occurred; (2) LANDEC can only recover for breaches of
representations and warranties occurring prior to the sale of Yucatan and all
of the acts of wrong doing alleged in the Cross-Complaint occurred subsequent
to the sale of Yucatan; (3) LANDEC has ratified the alleged acts of wrong
doing; and (4) LANDEC cannot prove reliance on environmental representations
and warranties because it retained an expert to investigate such matters during
its due diligence process; 
 
3. The fifth cause of action against CUGA in the
Cross-Complaint for breach of contract fails because: (1) the only obligations
undertaken by CUGA in the operative contract are to indemnify LANDEC for any
breach of any warranty or representation made by Yucatan; (2) the operative
contract prevents LANDEC from pursuing such claim(s) unless and until it has
recovered a requisite amount of damages from other named cross-defendants, an
event which has not occurred; (3) LANDEC can only recover for breaches of representations
and warranties occurring prior to the sale of Yucatan and all of the acts of
wrong doing alleged in the Cross-Complaint occurred subsequent to the sale of
Yucatan; (4) LANDEC has ratified the alleged acts of wrong doing; and (5)
LANDEC cannot prove reliance on environmental representations and warranties
because it retained an expert to investigate such matters during its due
diligence process; 
 
4. The sixth cause of action against CUGA in the
Cross-Complaint for equitable indemnity fails because CUGA engaged in no
inequitable conduct towards LANDEC; and a claim for equitable indemnity cannot
be made where, as is the case here, a written contract sets forth the parties’
indemnification rights; 
 
5. The seventh cause of action against CUGA in
the Cross-Complaint for unjust enrichment fails because CUGA was not unjustly
enriched by LANDEC; and no claim for unjust enrichment lies where there is an
enforceable written contract between the parties.
 
            Landec opposes the motion and CUGA
replies.

LEGAL STANDARDS – MOTION FOR SUMMARY
JUDGMENT/ADJUDICATION
 
“[T]he party moving for
summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue
of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law[.]
There is a triable issue of material fact if, and only if, the evidence would
allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the
party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.”
¿(Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850
(hereafter Aguilar).) ¿“[T]he party moving for summary judgment bears an
initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence
of any triable issue of material fact; if he carries his burden of production,
he causes a shift, and the opposing party is then subjected to a burden of
production of his own to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a
triable issue of material fact.” ¿(Ibid.; Smith v. Wells Fargo Bank,
N.A. (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 1463, 1474 [summary judgment standards held by Aguilar
apply to summary adjudication motions].)  
 
Further, “the trial court
may not weigh the evidence in the manner of a factfinder to determine whose
version is more likely true.  Nor may the
trial court grant summary judgment based on the court's evaluation of credibility.”  (Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th. at p. 840
[cleaned up]; see also Weiss v. People ex rel. Department of Transportation
(2020) 9 Cal.5th 840, 864 [“Courts deciding motions for summary judgment or
summary adjudication may not weigh the evidence but must instead view it in the
light most favorable to the opposing party and draw all reasonable inferences
in favor of that party”].)  
 
A party may move for
summary adjudication as to one or more causes of action, affirmative defenses,
claims for damages, or issues of duty if that party contends that there is no
merit to the cause of action, defense, or claim for damages, or if the party
contends that there is no duty owed.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (f)(1).)  “A motion for summary adjudication shall be
granted only if it completely disposes of a cause of action, an affirmative
defense, a claim for damages, or an issue of duty.”  (Ibid.)  A cause of action has no merit if: (1) one or
more elements of the cause of action cannot be separately established, even if
that element is separately pleaded, or (2) a defendant establishes an
affirmative defense to that cause of action. 
(See Code Civ. Proc., §
437c, subd. (n); Union Bank v. Superior
Court (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 573, 583.) 
Once the defendant has shown that a cause of action has no merit, the
burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of material fact
exists as to that cause of action.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (o)(2); Union Bank v. Superior Court, supra, 31 Cal.App.4th at p.
583.)  Additionally, in line with Aguilar,
“[o]n a motion for summary adjudication, the trial court has no discretion to
exercise.  If a triable issue of material fact exists as to the challenged
causes of action, the motion must be denied. If there is no triable issue of
fact, the motion must be granted.”  (Fisherman's Wharf Bay Cruise Corp.
v. Superior Court (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 309, 320.) 
 
DISCUSSION

 
1.     ISSUE 1: CIVIL CONSPIRACY
 
As Landec points out in
Opposition, and CUGA concedes in Reply, Landec has already dismissed the third
cause of action for civil conspiracy against CUGA as of April 22, 2022.  
 
Therefore, the Court denies
summary adjudication as to Issue 1 as moot.
 
2.     ISSUE 2 AND 3: CONTRACTUAL INDEMNITY AND
BEACH OF CONTRACT
 
“To prevail on a cause of
action for breach of contract, the plaintiff must prove (1) the contract, (2)
the plaintiff's performance of the contract or excuse for nonperformance, (3)
the defendant's breach, and (4) the resulting damage to the plaintiff.”  (Richman v. Hartley (2014) 224
Cal.App.4th 1182, 1186.)  
 
“Courts interpret contractual
indemnity provisions under the same rules governing other contracts, with a
view to determining the actual intent of the parties.”  (Maryland Casualty Co. v. Bailey &
Sons, Inc. (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 856, 864.)
 
The fourth cause of action for
contractual indemnity alleges that CUGA owes Landec indemnity by virtue of
Section 12.02 of the Stock Purchase Agreement (“SPA”).  The fifth cause of action for breach of
contract alleges CUGA breached the SPA by making misrepresentations and
omissions in the SPA.
 
CUGA’s Evidence
 
CUGA has provided the
following evidence:
 
·      
In
December 2017, CUGA entered into a Yucatan Foods, LP Limited Partnership
Interest Subscription Agreement whereby it acquired limited partnership
interests in Yucatan.  (Corzo Decl. at ¶
3 and Ex. A.)
 
·      
CUGA
never had any involvement in Yucatan’s or any of its subsidiaries’ day to day
business operations at any point in time. 
(Corzo Decl. ¶ 4.)
 
·      
No one
from CUGA ever visited the guacamole plant in Silao, was provided any
information on the day to day business operations of Yucatan or any of its
subsidiaries, or any information prior to the sale of Yucatan to Landec that
Yucatan, its subsidiaries, or any agent thereof violated any laws.  (Corzo Decl. ¶ 4.)
 
·      
In
December 2018, Luis Ramirez Corzo executed the SPA on behalf of CUGA.  (Corzo Decl. ¶ 6.)
 
·      
At the
time Corzo executed the SPA on behalf of CUGA in December 2018, Corzo had no
information that any statements made in the SPA were false, misleading, or
inaccurate.  (Corzo Decl. ¶ 6.)
 
Further, CUGA has provided a
copy of the SPA, which provides in relevant part:
 
ARTICLE 3 
 
Representations and Warranties Regarding the Companies 
 
Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedules (subject to
Section 13.03(a)), which schedules shall identify any exceptions to the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, Yucatan represents
and warrants to Buyer that the following statements are true and correct as of
the date of this Agreement, except with respect to statements that speak to an
earlier date, in which case, they shall be so true and correct as of such earlier
date
 
[…]
 
Section 12.02 Indemnification of Buyer Indemnified Parties.
Effective at and after the Closing, subject to the limitations set forth in
this ARTICLE 12, each Equityholder severally, but not jointly, in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, including Section 12.03 below, hereby
indemnifies Buyer, the Company Parties, their respective Affiliates and their
respective officers, directors, managers, employees, agents, successors and
assignees (collectively, the “Buyer Indemnified Parties”) against, and
agrees to hold each of them harmless from, any and all Damages (whether
involving a Third Party Claim or a claim solely between the parties hereto),
incurred or suffered by the Buyer Indemnified Parties to the extent arising out
of, with respect to or by reason of: 
 
(a) any inaccuracy in or misrepresentation or breach of any
representation or warranty (each, a “Warranty Breach”) of (i) Yucatan in
ARTICLE 3 of this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by Yucatan at
Closing pursuant hereto, (ii) Camden in ARTICLE 4 of this Agreement or in any
certificate delivered by Camden at Closing pursuant hereto or (iii) any
Equityholder in ARTICLE 6 of this Agreement or in the Mexico Equity Interest
Purchase Agreement or in any certificate delivered by such Equityholder at
Closing pursuant hereto;
 
[…]
 
(e) Any Environmental Claim (regardless of, and notwithstanding
any, disclosure of any items that are the subject of an Environmental Claim in
the Company Disclosure Schedules or the Camden Disclosure Schedules);
 
(f) Any non-compliance with Applicable Law
determined as a result of any audit, review or investigation by Governmental
Authorities as to import and export support documentation or procedures,
inventory controls, including Mexico’s Annex 24 and Annex 31 requirements, and
assets located in Mexico and relating to the activities or period prior to the
Closing (regardless of, and notwithstanding any, disclosure of any items that
are the subject of such indemnity claim in the Company Disclosure Schedules or
the Camden Disclosure Schedules);
 
[…]
 
Section 12.03 Limitations on
Indemnification by Equityholders; Type and Order of Recovery. 
 
(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement or any Transaction Document, or any certificates
delivered at Closing pursuant thereto, except in the case of Damages for any
Warranty Breach for breaches of the Fundamental Representations or Fraud (as to
which the limitations set forth in this Section 12.03(a) shall not apply), the
Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover any Damages in
respect of any Warranty Breach under Section 12.02(a) in the aggregate, in excess
of Six Million Dollars ($6,000,000) (the “Indemnification Cap”). For the
avoidance of doubt, any indemnification payments made with respect to a
Warranty Breach for breaches of the Fundamental Representations or Fraud shall
not be included in the determination of whether the Indemnification Cap has
been met. 
 
(b) With respect to indemnification by the
Equityholders for Warranty Breaches under Section 12.02(a), except in the case
of Damages for any Warranty Breach, for breaches of the Fundamental
Representations or Fraud (as to which the limitations set forth in this Section
12.03(b) shall not apply), the Equityholders shall not be liable for any such
Warranty Breaches unless and until the aggregate amount of all Damages with
respect to all Warranty Breaches covered by this Section 12.03(b) exceeds an
amount equal to Four Hundred Thousand Dollars ($400,000) (such amount, the “Equityholders’
Basket”) and then only to the extent of such excess. 
 
(c) A Buyer Indemnified Party shall recover
Damages (to the extent in excess of the Equityholders’ Basket if applicable) in
respect of any indemnification claim under Section 12.02: 
 
(i)             
first from the Indemnification Escrow; and 
(ii)           
second, following the release or exhaustion of
the Indemnification Escrow, from the Equityholders in accordance with the order
of recovery described in Section 12.03(f) and Section 12.03(g) below, as
illustrated in the Liability Waterfall.
 
(f) For the duration of the Initial Lock-Up Period, the Buyer Indemnitees’
sole source of recovery for Damages shall be against the Stock Consideration
received by the Camden Stockholders, including any additional Stock
Consideration issued as Adjustment Consideration (the “Total Stock
Consideration”), unless and until the Buyer Indemnitees have recovered
Damages equal the value of the Total Stock Consideration, after which the Buyer
Indemnitees’ sole source of recovery for Damages shall be against the Preferred
Limited Partners in cash, in each case, subject to the Equityholders’ Basket
(to the extent applicable), the Indemnification Cap (to the extent applicable),
and the other limitations set forth in this Section 12.03, all as illustrated
in the Liability Waterfall. 
 
(g) From and after the expiration of the Initial Lock-Up Period, the
Buyer Indemnitees’ sole source of recovery for Damages shall continue to be
against the Total Stock Consideration to the extent the same remains held by
the Camden Stockholders, and thereafter against the Camden Stockholders in
cash, unless and until the Buyer Indemnitees have recovered Damages equal to
the value of the Total Stock Consideration still held, after which the Buyer
Indemnitees’ sole source of recovery for Damages shall be against the Preferred
Limited Partners in cash, in each case, subject to the Equityholders’ Basket
(to the extent applicable), the Indemnification Cap (to the extent applicable)
and the other limitations set forth in this Section 12.03, all as illustrated in
the Liability Waterfall. 
 
(h) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in this
Agreement or any Transaction Document, in no event shall any Equityholder have
any liability under Section 12.02 in excess of the portion of the Aggregate
Acquisition Consideration received by such Equityholder, whether in respect of
a Warranty Breach, a Covenant Breach, Fraud or otherwise. More specifically,
each Camden Stockholder shall not have any liability for Damages in excess of the
value of the portion of the Total Stock Consideration received by such Camden
Stockholder, and each Preferred Limited Partner shall not have any liability
for Damages in excess of the Preferred Payout received by such Preferred
Limited Partner, all as illustrated in the Liability Waterfall.
 
(Ex. B to Corzo Decl. at pp. 9, 51-53.) 
 
            Further,
CUGA provides the Haerizadeh Declaration, which indicates:
 
8. The sale of Yucatan to Tanok closed on or
about December 1, 2018. As of the date of the sale, neither I nor to my
knowledge anyone else, had any knowledge, information or belief that Yucatan or
Tanok was in violation of, or had previously violated, any law or regulation
governing its business operations including but not limited to environmental
and anti-corruption laws. I can state for certain that, as of the date of the
sale of Yucatan to LANDEC, neither Yucatan nor Tanok had been notified by any governmental
body of any violation of environmental or anti-corruption laws nor had any
governmental body advised us that they intended to bring claims that Yucatan or
Tanok was in violation of any law or regulation. To this date, I am not aware
of LANDEC, or any party to be indemnified under the SPA, incurring any damages
relating to any violation of law by Yucatan or Tanok occurring prior to the
close of the sale of those companies to LANDEC on December 1, 2018. 
 
9. Prior to August 2019, I had been removed from
having any operational control over Tanok, including from having any role in
its environmental compliance efforts. On or about August 1, 2019, I was told by
Dan Walton that he had been informed that LANDEC’s environmental related
expenses, including the construction of a wastewater treatment plant, were now
expected to be approximately $1,000,000. This was surprising to me and to Mr.
Walton, because we as sellers had agreed in the SPA that these expenses would
be paid out of the sales proceeds being retained in escrow and these expenses
had previously been anticipated to be in the $500,000 range after the
construction of the wastewater treatment plant, which to my knowledge had
inexplicably not even started yet. I, therefore, sent an email to LANDEC’s
controller, Brandon Merlo, asking him to provide me with a copy of the costs
incurred as of now. A true and correct copy of an email chain containing my
email to Brandon Merlo on August 1, 2019 is attached hereto as Exhibit “A.”
(Deposition Exhibit 136) 
 
10. Mr. Merlo responded that same day with a
summary of expenses for environmental issues. Mr. Merlo wrote that the total
environmental expenses as of July 2019 were $980,000, which included $630,000
for the wastewater treatment facility, $260,000 for monthly water certification
(Benjamen Monus) and $90,000 for an ammonia system installation. Mr. Merlo
indicated in his email that the $260,000 amount was a monthly charge ($32,500
per month) that LANDEC had and will continue to incur until the wastewater treatment
plant that was under construction was completed in what was expected to be
December 2019. A true and correct copy of Mr. Merlo’s August 1, 2019, email to
me is included within the email chain attached hereto as Exhibit “A.” 
 
11. I did not know who Benjamin Monus was, and
inquired, after which I learned it was the same as a company named Ecosani. I
also did not understand why the amount being paid was so high and who had
authorized the expense of $32,500 monthly payments being made by LANDEC. I,
therefore, wrote Mr. Merlo and asked him who authorized and is authorizing the
payments to Benjamin Munoz. A true and correct copy of my email to Brandon
Merlo on August 2, 2019 is also included in the email chain attached hereto as Exhibit
“A.” 
 
12. I then contacted Manuel Perez, who I had
previously demoted to maintenance manager while he worked for Yucatan, but
Landec had promoted to Plant manager of the Tanok facility. Mr. Perez informed
me that these payments were high because the consultant/vendor Mr. Munoz or
Ecosani was being asked to obtain daily certificates and that he had to pay
someone in the municipal water department to get such certificates . When I
obtained this information, I immediately instructed Mr. Perez to cease making
any such payments for wastewater certificates. I now have learned in discovery
during this lawsuit that, after I instructed Mr. Perez not to make further
payments for the wastewater certificates, he emailed a LANDEC operation’s
officer and advised him that if the payments were not made there could be
serious ramifications including a possible plant shut down. Indeed those email
exchanges are also part of the chain in Exhibit “A.” 
 
13. I subsequently had discussions on this
subject with and explained to LANDEC’s senior management including Greg
Skinner, LANDEC’s Chief Financial Officer, and Brandon Merlo, a LANDEC
controller, that I had just learned that part of the payments were in the
nature of bribes and must be discontinued. Mr. Skinner told me that as a CFO of
a publicly traded corporation he could not be on a call where the subject of
bribes made to government officials was being discussed, and he said he would
look into it and we would reconvene next week. We never did and in spite of my
attempts to speak to Mr. Merlo and Skinner subsequently, they kept cancelling
meetings. Subsequent to my communications and protestations about the improper
payments being made, I was first put on leave from LANDEC on October 15, 2019,
and, my employment with LANDEC was then terminated on February 20, 2020.
 
(Haerizadeh Decl. ¶¶ 8-13.)
 
CUGA argues that the breach of
contract claim is not yet ripe, because Landec admits its total damages do not
exceed the $20,000,000 currently held in escrow to satisfy such claims.  (UMF No. 57 [Bolles Depo. Transcript at pp.
187:14-188:6.])  
 
However, this argument
conflates Landec’s claim for damages incurred as a result of CUGA’s breach of
contract with CUGA’s affirmative defense that any amount owed should be offset
by or otherwise paid from the amount currently held in escrow.  That CUGA has an argument as to where the
payment for breach, if any, should come from does not mean that Landec’s claim
is unripe.[1]
 
CUGA also argues that the
contract-related claims fail because both Corzo (on behalf of CUGA) and
Haerizadeh (on behalf of Yucatan) declared that they had no reason to know that
the representations and warranties in the SPA were false in December 2018 when the
SPA was signed.  Furthermore, the
evidence of the bribes (a total of $260,000, representing $32,500 monthly,
estimated to end in December 2019) means the bribes would have occurred for 8
months ($32,500 x 8 = $260,000) from April or May 2019 up to/through December
2019, when the wastewater treatment plant was expected to be up and
running.  But April 2019 was after the
acquisition.  Nor is there any evidence
of an environmental claim.
 
Thus, CUGA has met its initial
burdens of production and persuasion as to Issues 2 and 3 that it did not
breach the agreement because the warranties and representations were not false
when made.
 
Landec’s Evidence
 
            Landec
has provided the Declaration of Adrian Gomez of Ramboll, who visited the Tanok
facility to conduct environmental due diligence in October of 2018, regarding Yucatan’s
pre-acquisition noncompliance with Mexican law regarding dumping wastewater
into the Silao river as follows:
 
4.         In conducting the due diligence, on
October 15, 2018, I emailed Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Ardeshir Haerizadeh
(“Haerizadeh”) regarding a list of documents I would need to review at my
on-site visit and inspection of Tanok on October 22 and 23, 2018.  In response, Haerizadeh put me in touch with
Manuel Durah (“Duran”) to accompany me on my site inspection.  […]
 
6.         As part of my assessment, on October
22, 2018, I asked Duran about certain documents including those related to
water.  In response, Duran provided me
with certain documents including a contract with Sistema de Agua Potable y
Alcantarillado de Silao (“SAPAS”).  A
true and correct copy of Duran’s email to me with accompanying documents,
including the SAPAS contract, is attached to the concurrently filed Appendix of
Evidence as Exhibit “B.”
 
7.         With regard to its wastewater, Duran
informed me during my visit that the facility treats their process wastewater
via a 3-state solid separation process and then discharges the wastewater into
the municipal sewer system, SAPAS.
 
[…]
 
10.       At no time before doing so did anyone at
Tanok disclose to me that Tanok had vendors create false manifests purporting
to haul away Tanok’s process wastewater or paid bribes to expedite permits
Tanok needed.
 
[…]
 
12.       I revisited Tanok on September 26, 2019,
to evaluate and determine the extent of the issues and the necessary
remediations.
 
13.       During this visit, I again met with
Duran.  I asked him if he had provided
misleading information about where Tanok’s wastewater was going during my
October 2018 inspection.
 
14.       Duran admitted that he lied to me
intentionally and stated that Haerizadeh had told him to not mention that the
wastewater was going to the Silao river. 
Duran said that he gave me the SAPAS contract when he in fact knew that
the contract was for discharge of sanitary wastewater and not process
wastewater.  He admitted he did so to
mislead me and to support the lie about the process wastewater going to the
municipal sewer system.
 
15.       Duran told me that he told Haerizadeh and
Manuel Perez about the misinformation he had given me.
 
(Gomez Decl. ¶¶ 4, 6-7, 12-15.)
 
Landec further provides the April
25, 2024 deposition testimony of Manuel Perez, who testifies that prior to the
acquisition, he and Haerizadeh decided to unlawfully discharge Tanok’s
wastewater into the Silao river because Yucatan lacked the funds to discharge
it lawfully.  (Ex. E at pp. 20-30.)  Perez also testified that they made payments
to a company called Eco Sani to obtain fictitious historical manifests
documenting that Tanok’s wastewater was hauled away, when in fact it had been
illegally dumped into the river.  (Ex. E
at pp. 42-52.)  
 
Thus, Landec has met its
burden of production to create triable issues of material fact (in particular
Undisputed Materials Facts Nos. 23 and 26.) that Yucatan had knowingly violated
the law by dumping its wastewater into the Silao river and paid for fictitious
historical manifests to cover up the illegal discharge.
 
3.     ISSUE 4: EQUITABLE INDEMNITY
 
“The elements of a cause of
action for [equitable] indemnity are (1) a showing of fault on the part of the
indemnitor and (2) resulting damages to the indemnitee for which the indemnitor
is ... equitably responsible.”  (C.W.
Howe Partners Inc. v. Mooradian (2019) 43 Cal.App.5th 688, 700.)
 
            As
discussed above, there is a disputed issue of material fact regarding whether
Yucatan knowingly discharged its wastewater in the Silao river illegally and
paid for fictitious historical manifests to cover that fact up prior to the
acquisition, such that the representations and warranties in the SPA were false
when made.  Therefore, Landec could
demonstrate CUGA’s fault in making the false representations and warranties in
the SPA.  
 
            However, equitable indemnity may be either
implied from a contract not specifically mentioning indemnity, or it can arise
from tort.  (Rossmore Sanitation, Inc.
v. Python, Inc. (1975) 13 Cal.3d 622, 628.) 
Here, because the contract at issue contains a lengthy indemnification
provision, the language of the contract controls and there can be no implied equitable
indemnity as a matter of law.
 
            Landec
argues that it should be allowed to present both theories of indemnity to the
jury – contract and tort.  However, while
fraud and fraudulent inducement are alleged as to Haerizadeh, there is no
allegation or evidence of a tort by CUGA. 

 
            Therefore,
CUGA has met its burdens of production and persuasion that it is entitled to
summary adjudication as to Issue 4, and Landec has not created any triable
issue of material fact.
 
4.     ISSUE 5: UNJUST ENRICHMENT
 
Similar to equitable indemnity, “As a matter of law,
an unjust enrichment claim does not lie where the parties have an enforceable
express contract.”  (Durell v. Sharp
Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1370.)  In arguing otherwise, Landec cites to Garfield
on behalf of ODP Corporation v. Allen (Del. Ch. 2022) 277 A.3d 296,
341.)  But Garfield was decided at
the pleadings stage, not at the summary judgment stage.  Plaintiffs are permitted to “plead in the
alternative and make inconsistent allegations.” 
(Klein v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc. (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1342, 1388.)  
 
Here, because the evidence demonstrates an
enforceable written contract, Landec must recover pursuant to the contractual
provisions, as opposed to equitable quasi-contract theories.
 
Therefore, CUGA has met its burdens of production
and persuasion that it is entitled to summary adjudication as to Issue 5 and
Landec has not created any triable issue of material fact.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court grants in part and denies in part CUGA’s motion
for summary adjudication.  Finding no disputed
issue of material fact that Landec’s claims are governed by the contract, such
that Landec may not recover for equitable indemnity or unjust enrichment, the
Court grants summary adjudication as to Issues 4 and 5.  
 
Finding disputed issues of material fact that Yucatan engaged in
pre-acquisition wastewater dumping and the purchase of fictitious manifests to cover
up the dumping in violation of Mexican law, such that CUGA breached the SPA by
virtue of representing and warranting that Yucatan was not in violation of the
law, the Court denies summary adjudication as to Issues 2 and 3.  Further, as the third cause of action for
civil conspiracy has already been dismissed, the Court denies summary
adjudication as to Issue 1 as moot.
 
Because the Court denies summary adjudication as to Issues 1, 2, and
3, the Court similarly denies summary judgment.
 
CUGA shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file the notice
with a proof of service forthwith.

BACKGROUND
 
On February 2, 2020, Plaintiff Ardeshir Haerizadeh (“Plaintiff”), the
founder of Yucatan Foods, brought suit against Defendants Landec Corporation and
Apio Inc. (collectively, “Landec” or “Defendants”), who acquired Yucatan Foods,
alleging four causes of action for (1) breach of employment contract; (2) breach
of holdback agreement; (3) declaratory relief (as to whether the non-compete
provisions in the Employment Agreement are enforceable in light of Plaintiff’s
termination without cause); and (4) accounting. 

 
On November 3, 2020, Defendants brought a cross-complaint against
Cross-Defendants Haerizadeh, Dan Walton, Warren Schlichting, Robert Hall,
Sepand Riahi, Allen Lance Mcinnes, John Barber, Michael F. Baxter, Doug Harmon,
George H. Davis Jr., Adam Cardenas, Kevin Gay, Aaron Morris, J.F. Shea Co.,
Inc. as Nominee 1996-1, and Desarrollos Inmobiliarios Cuga, S.A.P.I. de C.V. (collectively,
“cross-defendants”) alleging seven causes of action for (1) fraud; (2)
fraudulent inducement; (3) civil conspiracy; (4) contractual indemnity; (5)
breach of contract; (6) equitable indemnity; and (7) unjust enrichment.
 
Defendants move for summary judgment, or in the alternative, summary
adjudication on the following issues:
 
1. Haerizadeh’s first cause of action for breach
of employment contract fails because Haerizadeh was terminated for cause under
section 6(c) of the Executive Employment Agreement, and as a matter of law,
Haerizadeh is not entitled to damages as requested. 
 
2. Regarding Haerizadeh’s second cause of action
for breach of Holdback Agreement, as a matter of law and because Haerizadeh was
terminated for cause, the Holdback Agreement is inapplicable and Section 3(a)
of the Holdback Agreement is not invoked. Accordingly, summary adjudication
should be granted in Landec’s favor. 
 
3. Regarding Haerizadeh’s third cause of action
for declaratory relief, Haerizadeh cannot establish that his termination was
without cause under the Executive Employment Agreement or that Section 3(a) of
the Holdback Agreement has been invoked. As a matter of law, and as set forth
in the Executive Employment Agreement and the Holdback Agreement, Haerizadeh
was terminated for cause and Section 3(a) of the Holdback Agreement was not
invoked and he is not entitled to recovery under the Employment Agreement. Accordingly,
summary adjudication should be granted on this claim. 
 
4. Regarding Haerizadeh’s fourth cause of action
for an accounting, as Haerizadeh was terminated with cause, as a matter of law
and as set forth in the Executive Employment Agreement and the Holdback
Agreement, he is not entitled to any sums thereunder. Accordingly, summary
adjudication should be granted in Landec’s favor on this claim.
 
            Plaintiff opposes the motion and
Defendants reply.

LEGAL STANDARDS – MOTION FOR SUMMARY
JUDGMENT/ADJUDICATION
 
“[T]he party moving for
summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue
of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law[.]
There is a triable issue of material fact if, and only if, the evidence would
allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the
party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.”
¿(Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850
(hereafter Aguilar).) ¿“[T]he party moving for summary judgment bears an
initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence
of any triable issue of material fact; if he carries his burden of production,
he causes a shift, and the opposing party is then subjected to a burden of
production of his own to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a
triable issue of material fact.” ¿(Ibid.; Smith v. Wells Fargo Bank,
N.A. (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 1463, 1474 [summary judgment standards held by Aguilar
apply to summary adjudication motions].)  
 
Further, “the trial court
may not weigh the evidence in the manner of a factfinder to determine whose
version is more likely true.  Nor may the
trial court grant summary judgment based on the court's evaluation of credibility.”  (Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th. at p. 840
[cleaned up]; see also Weiss v. People ex rel. Department of Transportation
(2020) 9 Cal.5th 840, 864 [“Courts deciding motions for summary judgment or
summary adjudication may not weigh the evidence but must instead view it in the
light most favorable to the opposing party and draw all reasonable inferences
in favor of that party”].)  
 
A party may move for
summary adjudication as to one or more causes of action, affirmative defenses,
claims for damages, or issues of duty if that party contends that there is no
merit to the cause of action, defense, or claim for damages, or if the party
contends that there is no duty owed.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (f)(1).)  “A motion for summary adjudication shall be
granted only if it completely disposes of a cause of action, an affirmative
defense, a claim for damages, or an issue of duty.”  (Ibid.)  A cause of action has no merit if: (1) one or
more elements of the cause of action cannot be separately established, even if
that element is separately pleaded, or (2) a defendant establishes an
affirmative defense to that cause of action. 
(See Code Civ. Proc., §
437c, subd. (n); Union Bank v. Superior
Court (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 573, 583.) 
Once the defendant has shown that a cause of action has no merit, the
burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of material fact
exists as to that cause of action.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (o)(2); Union Bank v. Superior Court, supra, 31 Cal.App.4th at p.
583.)  Additionally, in line with Aguilar,
“[o]n a motion for summary adjudication, the trial court has no discretion to
exercise.  If a triable issue of material fact exists as to the challenged
causes of action, the motion must be denied. If there is no triable issue of
fact, the motion must be granted.”  (Fisherman's Wharf Bay Cruise Corp.
v. Superior Court (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 309, 320.) 
 
DISCUSSION

 
“To prevail on a cause of
action for breach of contract, the plaintiff must prove (1) the contract, (2)
the plaintiff's performance of the contract or excuse for nonperformance, (3)
the defendant's breach, and (4) the resulting damage to the plaintiff.”  (Richman v. Hartley (2014) 224
Cal.App.4th 1182, 1186.)  
 
            “An
action for an accounting has two elements: (1) that a relationship exists
between the plaintiff and defendant that requires an accounting” and (2) “that
some balance is due the plaintiff that can only be ascertained by an
accounting.”  (Sass v. Cohen
(2020) 10 Cal.5th 861, 869.)
 
            Plaintiff
also seeks a declaration, “as to whether the non-compete provisions in
the Employment Agreement are enforceable under California law given that Plaintiff
was terminated without cause, and neither his shares nor the requisite salary
have been paid him, as well as the other circumstances of the transaction which
mitigate against enforceability of the provision.”  (Complaint ¶ 55.)
 
1.     DEFENDANTS’ EVIDENCE
 
            Defendants contend that all four of
Plaintiff’s claims fail because Plaintiff was terminated for cause, and
therefore, there was no breach of contract and Plaintiff is not entitled to the
relief requested.  In support, Defendants
have provided the following evidence:
 
Landec’s Acquisition and Stock Purchase
Agreement
 
·       In December 2018, Landec (through Apio)
acquired Yucatan Foods, L.P., a guacamole maker, from Plaintiff and the other
cross-defendants through a Capital Contribution Stock Purchase Agreement
(“SPA”).  (UMF No. 60.)
 
·       The SPA held back certain consideration,
including certain amounts in an “Indemnification Escrow” as security against
indemnification obligations.  (UMF No.
4.)
 
·       Section 3(a) of the Escrow Agreement (Exhibit
C to the SPA) provides, “The Escrow Agent shall release the Escrow Asset
only in accordance with (i) any joint written instructions executed by both
Equityholders’ Representative and Purchaser; or (ii) a written notification
from Purchaser or Equityholders’ Representative of a final and non-appealable
decision, order, judgment or decree of a court of competition jurisdiction or
an arbitrator, which notification shall attach a copy of such final and
non-appealable decision, order, judgment or decree (a “Final Order”).” (UMF No.
5.)
 
·       Section 3(a) of the Holdback Agreement
(Exhibit I to the SPA) states:
 
o  
“The Holdback Period shall commence on the date
of this Holdback Agreement and (i) with respect to 50% of the Subject Shares
held by each Holder, shall continue to and include November 30, 2021, and (ii)
with respect to the remaining 50% of the Subject Shares held by each Holder,
shall continue to and include November 30, 2022; provided, however, that the
Holdback Period shall be subject to earlier termination with respect to: 

(a)        (x) 50% of the Subject Shares
held by each Holder, effective on the date as of which Ardeshir Haerizadeh
(“AH”) dies, is terminated by the Company due to a Disability, is terminated by
the Company without Cause and/or resigns from the Company for Good Reason
provided such date is prior to November 30, 2021 (the “AH Early Termination
Trigger Date”), as each such capitalized term is defined in the Employment
Agreement executed by and between AH and the Company on the Closing Date, and
(y) the remaining 50% of the Subject Shares held by each Holder, effective on
the one-year anniversary of the AH Early Termination Trigger Date;” (UMF No. 6.)
 
The Executive Employment Agreement
 
·       As part of the acquisition, Landec hired Plaintiff
as Vice President of Avocado Products pursuant to an Executive Employment
Agreement.  (UMF No. 61.)
 
·       Paragraph 2 of Plaintiff’s Executive
Employment Agreement provides: “The Company agrees to employ the
Employee pursuant to the terms of this Agreement for a term of four (4) years
commencing as of the Effective Date (the “Initial Term”). Thereafter, the term
shall be automatically extended for terms of one (1) year each (each such term,
a “Renewal Term”), unless the Board objects to such extension by delivering
written notice to the Employee at least sixty (60) days prior to the expiration
of the Initial Term or the applicable Renewal Term. The Employee’s
employment may also be terminated by the Company with or without Cause
or by the Employee for or without Good Reason, all as more fully described
herein.” (UMF No. 15, emphasis added.)
 
·       Paragraph 6(c)(ii)-(iii) of the Executive
Employment Agreement defines “Cause” as including:
 
o  
“gross
negligence in connection with the performance of the Employee’s
responsibilities hereunder, material willful violation of any duty to the
Company or any other material willful misconduct on the part of the Employee,
provided the Employee shall have first received written notice from the Board
stating the nature of such failure and, if curable, afforded the Employee at
least fifteen (15) calendar days to correct the act or omission complained of”
and 
 
o  
“the Employee’s willful failure or refusal to
perform the Employee’s duties hereunder, follow material Company policies or
follow the lawful directives of the Board, provided the Employee shall have
first received written notice from the Board stating the nature of such failure
and, if curable, afforded the Employee at least fifteen (15) calendar days to
correct the act or omission complained of[.]” (UMF No. 16.)
 
·       Paragraph 7(d) of the Executive Employment
Agreement provides that in the event of Company’s termination of Employee “other
than for Cause,” Company shall pay Employee various enumerated items.  (UMF No. 17.)
 
Landec’s Investigation of Plaintiff’s Misconduct
 
·       In or around August 2019, Plaintiff requested
information regarding indemnification amounts assessed that would reduce the
amount of consideration Plaintiff and other cross-defendants would ultimately
receive from held-back stock consideration, and Plaintiff also instructed
employees to stop making payments to a vendor purportedly providing wastewater
treatment services Yucatan’s guacamole production facility in Silao, Mexico
(“Tanok.”) (UMF Nos. 3, 20-22.)
 
·       Upon investigating, Landec discovered that
when Plaintiff built Tanok, he knew it was illegal under Mexican law to
discharge untreated wastewater into the nearby Silao river, but directed
employees to do so anyway to save the cost of building a wastewater treatment
plant (UMF Nos. 23-25.)
 
·       Landec further discovered that since 2016,
under Plaintiff’s direction, Tanok secured certifications from a wastewater
management vendor in Mexico purporting to collect and dispose of its waste when
Tanok was actually unlawfully discharging it into the nearby Silao River.  (UMF No. 26.)
 
·       Landec further discovered Plaintiff had
specifically instructed Yucatan employees not to disclose details of the
wastewater discharge to Landec during the due diligence and disclosure period
of the acquisition.  (UMF No. 27.)
 
·       Landec also discovered that between June 2018
and August 2019, Tanok paid a wastewater management vendor to create false,
backdated documents purporting to show that the vendor was collecting and
transporting Tanok’s wastewater to a municipal sewage treatment facility.  (UMF No. 32.)
 
·       Plaintiff also arranged for Mexican
government officials to be bribed to stamp and file the wastewater vendor’s
false, backdated documents, and arranged for Mexican government officials to be
bribed to prevent inspections of Tanok and expedite permits to allow Tanok to
legally discharge its wastewater. (UMF No. 33-34.)
 
·       Following Landec’s acquisition, Plaintiff
continued to cover up the previous illegal conduct.  (UMF No. 36.)
 
·       In the spring of 2019, Plaintiff signed
various financial certifications, misrepresenting that he had disclosed all
relevant communications with suppliers and growers and liabilities, and was not
aware of any fraud.  (UMF Nos. 37-38.)
 
Landec’s Code of Business Conduct
 
·       On December 17, 2018, Plaintiff signed
Landec’s Code of Business Conduct (“Code”), certifying that he was “not aware
of any violations of the Code as of the date of certification.”  (UMF Nos. 18-19.)
 
·       Section (i) of the Code provides, “Violations
of this Code can lead to disciplinary action, including immediate discharge,
for the persons involved.” and “Further, condoning or simply ignoring
questionable business practices of others can affect you, your colleagues and
Landec’s business and reputation. You are therefore responsible for reporting
all violations, illegal activities and dishonest or questionable behavior of
others of which you are aware.” (UMF No. 35, Ex. 3 at p. 224.)
 
·       Section (A) of the Code provides:
 
o  
“Obeying the law overrides every other
requirement of this Code. Your first consideration in any proposed action must
be whether the action is legal. All employees must obey – in letter and spirit
– the laws of the cities, states and countries where Landec operates.”  
 
o  
“The
Company’s policy is to deal honestly and fairly with government representatives
and agents and to comply with valid, reasonable governmental requests and
processes. Be truthful and straightforward in your dealings with governmental
representatives and do not direct or encourage another Landec employee (or
someone else) to provide false or misleading information to any government
agent or representative. Do not direct or encourage anyone to destroy records
relevant to a fact-finding process.” (UMF No. 35, Ex. 3 at p. 225.)
 
·       Section (D) of the Code provides: 
 
o  
“Government
and Union Personnel. You may not give, offer, ask for or accept, directly or
indirectly, any gift, gratuity or other business courtesy from or to any member
of the judiciary, any federal, state or local government employee, any union
representative or any representative of a regulator in connection with a
commercial transaction or governmental matter involving Landec.” and 
 
o  
“Bribes
and Kickbacks. You may not offer or pay directly or indirectly any “bribe,”
“kickback” or other payment of anything of value to any person for the purpose
of inducing any favorable action in a commercial transaction or a governmental
matter involving Landec.”  (UMF No. 35,
Ex. 3 at p. 227.)
 
·       Section (F) of the Code provides, “Employees
must never execute a document or otherwise commit the Company unless they have
clear authority to do so.” (UMF No. 35, Ex. 3 at p. 227.)
 
·       Section (G) of the Code provides:
 
o  
“Landec
shall make and keep books, invoices, records and accounts that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the Company. Each employee shall maintain accurate and fair records
of transactions, time reports, expense accounts, and other Company records. The
Company shall devise and maintain a system of internal controls sufficient to
provide reasonable assurances that transactions are properly authorized,
executed, and recorded. No entries will be made that intentionally conceal or
disguise the true nature of any Company transaction.” 
 
o  
“Responsibility
for compliance with this section does not rest solely with the Company’s
accounting employees. All Company employees involved in approving transactions,
supplying supporting documentation for transactions and determining account
classification of transactions have responsibility for complying with the
applicable provisions of this section. 

No false or intentionally misleading entries shall be made in the Company’s
accounting records. Intentional misclassification of transactions between accounts,
between departments or between accounting periods is a violation of this Code.
All transactions shall be supported by accurate documentation in reasonable
detail, recorded in the proper account and recorded in the proper accounting
time period. Compliance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)
and the Company’s systems of internal accounting controls is required at all
times.” 
 
o  
“The
same high standards required in the Company’s financial reporting to
shareholders, creditors, government entities and others outside the Company
shall apply to reports to management. Intentional misstatement of data provided
in such reports is a violation of this Code.”  
 
o  
“All
payments and all other dispositions of assets made by or on behalf of the
Company must be described accurately and fairly and in reasonable detail in the
Company’s accounting records and must be made only for the purpose described in
the documents and records supporting the payment or other asset disposition. No
payment or other asset disposition by or on behalf of the Company shall be made
without supporting documentation. No undisclosed or unrecorded fund or asset of
the Company shall be established or maintained for any purpose.”  (UMF No. 35, Ex. 3 at pp. 227-228.)
 
·       Section (K) of the Code provides, “In
conducting its business, Landec is committed to compliance with all applicable
laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, and in
particular those governing the incineration, treatment, storage, disposal, and
discharge of waste. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, even if
unintentional, could result in significant penalties for Landec. If an employee
suspects that there is noncompliance or a violation of these laws and
regulations, the circumstances should be reported immediately to his or her
supervisor, Chief Financial Officer or consult the procedures described under
“Administration of the Code”.” (UMF No. 35, Ex. 3 at p. 231.)
 
·       Section (L) of the Code provides:
 
o  
“any
employee having information or knowledge of any actual or contemplated action
or omission which appears to violate this Code shall promptly report such
information or knowledge to (i) his or her supervisor, (ii) the Company’s Chief
Financial Officer, (iii) a member of the Company’s Audit Committee, or (iv)
Landec’s employee complaint and whistleblower program.” 
 
o  
“Any failure by an employee to report a Code
violation in accordance with this Code section shall itself constitute a Code
violation.” 
 
o  
“Failure of any Company employee or officer to
comply with this Code may result in disciplinary action which, depending on the
circumstances of the matter, may include reprimand, probation, suspension,
demotion, salary reduction, bonus elimination or reduction or dismissal.
Disciplinary action will also apply to supervisors, managers and senior
executives who, with respect to those employees reporting to them: 

• know that conduct which is prohibited by this Code is contemplated by such
employees and do nothing to prevent it; or 

• know that conduct which is prohibited by this Code has been engaged in by
such employees and fail to take appropriate corrective action.  (UMF No. 35, Ex. 3 at pp. 232-234.)
 
·       Defendants therefore contend that Plaintiff
violated these sections of the Code as follows:
 
o  
Sections
(i), (A), and (D) by failing to comply with the laws of the jurisdictions in
which Landec operates, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;
 
o  
Sections
(i), (A), and (D) by causing bribes to be paid to foreign government officials;
 
o  
Sections
(i) and (A) by providing false information and causing false information to be
provided to government agencies;
 
o  
Sections
(i), (F), and (L) by committing, or causing the commitment of Landec to
financial obligations of third parties without authorization or compliance with
Landec’s policies;
 
o  
Sections
(i) and (G) by intentionally misrepresenting information provided to Company;
 
o  
Sections
(i) and (L) by failing to report misconduct; and 
 
o  
Sections
(i), (K), and (L) by failing to comply with environmental laws and regulations
and failing to report noncompliance.
 
Landec’s Written Notices to Plaintiff
and Opportunity to Cure
 
·       Landec took personnel action against
Plaintiff, including placing Plaintiff on paid leave on or around October 15,
2019.  (UMF No. 41.)
 
·       On November 13, 2019, Landec disclosed
Plaintiff’s misconduct at Tanok to the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission and the Department of Justice. 
(UMF No. 45.)
 
·       On November 19, 2019, Landec asked all
employees, including Plaintiff, to collect and preserve electronic and hard
copy documents relating to Yucatan and Tanok. 
(UMF No. 46.)
 
·       From approximately January 10 through January
24, 2020, Landec asked Plaintiff to meet with its counsel to provide Plaintiff
the opportunity to present his side of the story.  (UMF Nos. 47-49.)
 
·       Ultimately, Plaintiff refused to meet.  (UMF NO. 50.)
 
·       On January 24, 2020, Landec wrote to
Plaintiff, “we are writing to direct you to meet with outside counsel,
Manuel A. Abascal on Monday January 27, 2020 at 3 p.m. . . [sic] During the
meetings, Mr. Abascal will be asking you questions regarding compliance matters
at the Tanok facility, and we direct you to provide him with truthful
information.” (UMF No. 52.)
 
·       Plaintiff did not meet with Landec on January
27, 2020.  (UMF No. 53.)
 
·       On January 27, Landec wrote to Plaintiff,
stating that 
 
o  
Plaintiff’s
failure to follow their lawful directive breached paragraph 6(c)(iii) of the
Employment Agreement. (UMF No. 54.)
 
o  
Landec
was giving Plaintiff the required chance to cure his failure to follow the
lawful directive to meet with outside counsel by instructing him to meet on or
before February 11, 2020.  (UMF No. 55.)
 
o  
Landec
was giving Plaintiff written notice of non-curable breaches of sections
6(c)(ii) and (iii) of the Employment Agreement, including (a) false
documentation regarding environmental compliance and treatment of wastewater,
(b) payments to government officials by third parties, and (c) illegal
discharge of wastewater. (UMF No. 56.)
 
·       Plaintiff did not meet with Landec on or
before February 11, 2020.  (UMF No. 57.)
 
·       On February 11, 2020, Landec terminated
Plaintiff’s employment for insubordination, breach of employment duties, and
willful material misconduct and policy violations, in violation of sections
6(c)(ii) and (iii) of the Employment Agreement. 
(UMF No. 59.)
 
Thus, Defendants have met
their initial burdens of production and persuasion as to all four issues.
 
With respect to Issues 1 and 3,
Defendants have met their burdens of production and persuasion that Plaintiff’s
inquiries about indemnity payments (which would reduce Plaintiff’s holdback
shares) triggered an investigation which uncovered evidence that Plaintiff was
involved in an illegal wastewater discharge and bribery scheme in Mexico, after
which discovery they terminated Plaintiff for cause, in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the Employment Agreement, and therefore, no additional
sums are owed to Plaintiff pursuant to that agreement.
 
With respect to Issue 2, the
Holdback Agreement restricts Plaintiff’s ability to transfer or pledge to
transfer any of the held-back shares during the “holdback period.”  (See Ex. 1 at p. 120.)  However, the Holdback Agreement does not
govern when the held-back shares shall be payable back to
Plaintiff.  That is governed by the
Escrow Agreement, which provides, “The Escrow Agent shall release the
Escrow Asset only in accordance with (i) any joint written instructions
executed by both Equityholders’ Representative and Purchaser; or (ii) a written
notification from Purchaser or Equityholders’ Representative of a final and
non-appealable decision, order, judgment or decree of a court of competition
jurisdiction or an arbitrator, which notification shall attach a copy of such
final and non-appealable decision, order, judgment or decree (a “Final
Order”).” (UMF No. 5.)  
 
Yet there remains a dispute
regarding the amount (if any) that is properly deducted from the held back shares
in connection with the wastewater-related expenses.  As such, the parties have not yet agreed to
provide the escrow holder joint written instructions, nor is there a final and
non-appealable decision, order, judgment, or decree, such that payment would be
triggered.  Therefore, Defendants have
met their burdens of production and persuasion for Issue 2.
 
However, for the same reasons,
Defendants have not met their burdens of production and persuasion on Issue
4.  Plaintiff is still entitled to the
held-back shares (less indemnity expenses, etc.) regardless of whether he was
terminated with or without cause.  Because
the parties dispute what amounts (if any) are properly deducted from the
held-back shares, an accounting is warranted.
 
Therefore, Defendants have met
their burdens of production and persuasion for Issues 1, 2, and 3, but Defendants
have not met their initial burdens regarding Issue 4.    
 
2.     PLAINTIFF’S EVIDENCE
 
Plaintiff has provided a
declaration indicating:
 
·       Landec knew in November 2018 (prior to the
December 2018 acquisition) there were “risks” in the acquisition due to
Yucatan’s “environmental liability” that required “corrective action.”  (Haerizadeh Decl. ¶ 5 and Ex. 18.)  As a result, Plaintiff was to be employed by
Landec, but removed from any involvement in the corrective action process, any environmental
decision-making, or any operation oversight of Tanok going forward, instead
becoming VP of Avocado Products.  (Haerizadeh
Decl. ¶ 5 and Exs. 18.)[1]
 
·       Plaintiff was not aware of the bribes to the
water vendor, who Plaintiff had no personal communication with, and who was
obtained at the advice of Yucatan’s Mexican counsel.  (Haerizadeh Decl. ¶ 6.)
 
·       Plaintiff was not involved with the bribes or
false paperwork after the acquisition either, and the first Plaintiff heard
about it was in August 2019, when he inquired what the large monthly payments
were, and upon being told, immediately reported it to Landec’s CFO, Greg
Skinner and Brandon Merlo.  (Haerizadeh
Decl. ¶ 7.)
 
·       The Silao Department of Water (“SAPAS”) told
Plaintiff that as long as Yucatan committed to building a wastewater treatment
plant and purchased water from SAPAS to use in the Tanok facility, Yucatan
could continue to discharge their wastewater. (Haerizadeh Decl. ¶ 8.)
 
·       It should have been obvious to SAPAS that Tanok
was discharging its wastewater in the river, because there was no corresponding
sewage charge (“DRENAJE”) on its bill for the water to wash the avocados like
there was on its bill for the water for its toilets and washing machines.  (Haerizadeh Decl. ¶ 8 and Exs. 188-189.)
 
With respect to Issue 2,
Plaintiff has not met his burden of production to create a triable issue of
material fact.  Plaintiff merely presents
argument that Landec has not demonstrated any indemnity amounts that are
properly deducted from the held back escrow funds.  But as discussed above, the Holdback
agreement does not require the release of stock to Plaintiff at the end
of the Holdback Period, rather, it governs the restrictions on
Plaintiff’s ability to pledge that stock for sale during the Holdback Period.  The release of stock is governed by the
Escrow Agreement, and there is no disputed issue of material fact that the
conditions for the funds to be released have not yet been met.  Therefore, the Court grants summary
adjudication as to Issue 2.
 
With respect to Issues 1 and
3, Plaintiff’s evidence is sufficient to create a triable issue of material
fact as to whether Plaintiff actually lied on disclosures to Landec, made
bribes, or covered up the wrongdoing related to the wastewater discharge at
Tanok.  
 
However, Plaintiff has not
produced any evidence refuting that Plaintiff failed to follow Landec’s
directive to meet with them to tell his side of the story.  Instead, Plaintiff argues this directive was
not lawful or reasonable because (1) Plaintiff was not being
treated as an employee at the time, by virtue of his administrative leave, and
therefore was not bound by the policy at the time; (2) the meeting was being
used to try to retaliate against Plaintiff for blowing the whistle on the illegal
water bribes and to falsely report Plaintiff for the illegal conduct; and (3) because
Landec was acting as an agent of the government, Plaintiff had the right not to
speak to Landec’s special counsel.
 
Regarding Plaintiff’s first
argument, there is no genuine dispute that Plaintiff was on administrative
leave and was still employed at the time he was asked to meet with Landec.  As for Plaintiff’s third argument, while
Plaintiff had the right not to speak to Landec’s special counsel, he did not
necessarily have the right to do that and keep his job, pursuant to the
terms of the Employment Agreement.
 
            Regarding
Plaintiff’s second argument, however, Plaintiff has produced email evidence
demonstrating Landec was aware of the wastewater issue in November 2018 (prior
to the December 2018 acquisition).  (Exs.
18; 95.) Further, Plaintiff has produced declaratory evidence showing that
Plaintiff was the person who blew the whistle on the bribe payments and
instructed Yucatan employees to stop making those bribe payments, shortly
after which, Landec informed Plaintiff that the City of Silao suddenly approved
Tanok’s request to discharge its wastewater into the river (an approval
Plaintiff had attempted unsuccessfully to obtain for years).  (Haerizadeh Dec. ¶¶ 15-21.)  That same evidence calls into question the
placement of Plaintiff on administrative leave and the reporting of Plaintiff
to the SEC and the DOJ.  (Haerizadeh Dec.
¶¶ 27-32.)
 
As such, Plaintiff has met his
burden of production to create triable issues of material fact as to whether Plaintiff
was involved in the unlawful bribery and cover-up schemes, and whether the meetings
Landec requested with Plaintiff were lawful directives, or unlawful
whistleblower retaliation tactics.
 
            Therefore,
the Court denies summary adjudication as to Issues 1 and 3.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court grants in part and denies in part Defendants’
motion for summary adjudication.  Finding
no disputed issue of material fact that Landec’s failure to pay Plaintiff the
holdback shares did not breach the Holdback Agreement, which merely restricts
Plaintiff’s ability to divest those shares, the Court grants summary
adjudication as to Issue 2.  
 
Conversely, having found Defendants did not meet their initial burdens
of production and persuasion that no holdback shares are due to warrant an
accounting, the Court denies summary adjudication as to Issue 4.  
 
Finding Plaintiff created triable issues of material fact as to
whether Plaintiff was involved in the bribery and cover-up schemes and whether
Defendants’ request to interview Plaintiff with its special counsel was a
lawful request or an unlawful retaliation tactics, the Court denies summary
adjudication as to Issues 1 and 3.  
 
Because the Court denies summary adjudication as to Issues 1, 3 and 4,
the Court also denies summary judgment.
 
Defendants shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file the
notice with a proof of service regarding the same.
