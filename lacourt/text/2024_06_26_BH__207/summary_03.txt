And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering the concept of justiciability, which involves the criteria of ripeness and standing. Standing refers to a party's actual and substantial interest in the outcome of a case, and the degree to which they present their arguments. Ripeness refers to the requirement of a current controversy. The judge notes that an action that is not founded on an actual controversy between the parties and is brought solely to determine a point of law will not be entertained. The judge cites the Supreme Court's decision in City of Santa Monica v. Stewart (2005) as support for this principle.

Note that the case number, plaintiff's name, and defendant's name are all unknown, as the judge's tentative ruling does not provide this information.
