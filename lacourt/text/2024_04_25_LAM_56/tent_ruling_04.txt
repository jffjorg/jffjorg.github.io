  CASE NO.:  22STCV37904
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: DEMURRER AND
  MOTION TO STRIKE THE CROSS-COMPLAINT
 
Date: 
  April 25, 2024
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
Judge: Holly J. Fujie
 



 
MOVING PARTY: Cross-Defendant Senik Avetisyan (“Avetisyan”)
 
RESPONDING PARTY: Cross-Complainants Narek Kazarian (“Kazarian”) and
Spectrum Lending, LLC (“Spectrum”) (collectively, the “Spectrum Parties”)
 
The Court has considered the moving and opposition papers.  As of April 23, 2024, no reply has been
filed.
 
BACKGROUND
            This action arises
out of a dispute over real property (the “Property”).  The Cross-Complaint (the “XC”) alleges: (1)
breach of contract; (2) breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair
dealing; (3) unjust enrichment – restitution; (4) fraud and deceit –
intentional misrepresentation; (5) negligent misrepresentation; (6) fraud and
deceit – promise made without intention to perform; (7) injunctive relief; and
(8) declaratory relief.  
 
In relevant part, the XC alleges: In October
2020, Kazarian facilitated an agreement that was entered into by Avetisyan and
Spectrum for Spectrum to lend Avetisyan $500,000, which was secured by a deed
of trust (the “DOT”) against Avetisyan’s Property (the “Promissory Note”).  (XC, Introduction & Ex. 1.)  Spectrum is the lending entity and Kazarian is
Spectrum’s Principal.  (Id.)  Avetisyan signed the DOT on October 23,
2020.  (Id., Ex. 2.)  On October 23, 2020, the Spectrum Parties
delivered all of the loan funds to Avetisyan pursuant to the Promissory Note
secured by the DOT.  (XC,
Introduction.)  Pursuant to the
Promissory Note, the entire principal balance of $500,000.00 was due on
February 1, 2021.  (Id.)  As of the filing of the XC on November 8,
2023, the entire balance (plus any interest) remains outstanding.  (Id.) 

 
REQUEST
FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
            The Spectrum Parties request
judicial notice of several filings and court orders in the matters of (1) David
Hayrapetian v. Genesis Investments Group, LLC, et al. (LASC Case No.
23STCV14485), (2) Lusine Babloyan vs. Narek E. Kazarian, et al. (County
of Riverside Case No. CVRI2203223), and (3) Karen G. Berkibekyan vs. Narek
E. Kazarian, et al. (Los Angeles County Case No. 23STCV16584).

“Judicial notice may be taken of . . . records of (1) any court of
this state or (2) any court of record of the United Sates or of any state of
the United States.”  (Evid. Code §
452(d).)  Section 452 provides a proper
basis for judicial notice of the documents in the Spectrum Parties’
request.  
 
Upon taking notice of court records, the court accepts as true only
that (1) they were filed and (2) the assertions therein were made; the court
does not take notice of the truth of their contents.  (See Joslin v. H.A.S. Ins. Brokerage
(1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 369, 374-375; see also Day v. Sharp (1975) 50
Cal.App.3d 904, 916.)
 
DEMURRER
Meet and Confer
The meet and
confer requirement has been met for the Demurrer and Motion.
 
Legal Standard
A demurrer tests
the sufficiency of a complaint as a matter of law.  (Durell
v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.)  The court accepts as true all material
factual allegations and affords them a liberal construction, but it does not
consider conclusions of fact or law, opinions, speculation, or allegations
contrary to law or judicially noticed facts. 
(Shea Homes Limited Partnership v.
County of Alameda (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1246, 1254.)  With respect to a demurrer, the complaint
must be construed liberally by drawing reasonable inferences from the facts
pleaded.  (Rodas v. Spiegel (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 513, 517.)  While the allegations of a complaint must be
accepted as true for purposes of demurrer, the facts appearing in exhibits
attached to the complaint will also be accepted as true, and, if contrary to
the allegations in the pleading, will be given precedence.  (Moran v. Prime Healthcare
Management, Inc. (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th
1131, 1145-46.)  A demurrer will be
sustained without leave to amend if there exists no reasonable possibility that
the defect can be cured by amendment.  (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311,
318.)  
 
Demurrers for
uncertainty are disfavored.  (Chen v.
Berenjian (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 811, 822.) 
A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint
is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under
modern discovery procedures.  (Id.)
 
 
Whether
Kazarian Has Standing to Sue
            Avetisyan demurs to all of
Kazarian’s causes of action on the ground that the XC does not allege that
Kazarian was a party to the Promissory Note or the DOT.  Avetisyan contends that the allegation in the
XC that Kazarian is “Spectrum’s Principal” at page 2, lines 12-13, is not
sufficient to establish Kazarian’s standing to sue.  (Dem., 3:15-4:7.)  In opposition, the Spectrum Parties point to
paragraphs 10 through 15 of the XC, which they contend alleges that “Kazarian
lent Avetisyan $500,000.00.  (Opposition
to Dem., 4:22-25.)  However, the only
mention of Kazarian in those paragraphs in his individual capacity is that “Mr.
Avetisyan and Mr. Kazarian on behalf of Spectrum met in-person and
entered into an agreement, wherein Spectrum would lend Cross-Defendant
Mr. Avetisyan $500,000.00 . . .” (XC, ¶ 10.b. [emphasis added].)  Neither the Promissory Note nor the DOT make
any mention of Kazarian.  (See XC, Ex. 1
& 2.)
 
            Generally, a person who is not a
party to a contract has no standing to enforce the contract or to recover
damages for wrongful withholding of benefits to the contracting party. (See,
e.g., Republic Indemnity Co. v. Schofield (1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 220,
227; Gantman v. United Pacific Insurance Co. (1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 1560,
1566.)  As a general rule, “the proper
party to bring a claim on behalf of a corporation is the corporation
itself.”  (Bader v. Anderson
(2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 775, 789, citing Daily Income Fund, Inc. v. Fox
(1984) 464 U.S. 523, 531.)
 
            Kazarian, even as the principal of
Spectrum, lacks standing to sue under the Promissory Note and DOT.  Accordingly, Avetisyan’s demurrer is
SUSTAINED as to each of Kazarian’s causes of action, without leave to amend. 
 
Breach
of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing (2nd COA)
Avetisyan demurs to this cause of action on the ground it is
duplicative of the first cause of action for breach of contract.  The covenant of good faith and fair dealing
is implied by law in every contract, and it acts “as a supplement to the
express contractual covenants, to prevent a contracting party from engaging in
conduct which (while not technically transgressing the express covenants)
frustrates the other party’s rights to the benefits of the contract.”  (Racine & Laramie, Ltd. v. Department
of Parks & Recreation (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1026, 1031-1032.)  A breach of the implied covenant is
necessarily a breach of contract but may be pleaded as a separate count.  (Digerati Holdings, LLC v. Young Money
Entertainment, LLC (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 873, 885.)  “If the allegations do not go beyond the
statement of a mere contract breach and, relying on the same alleged acts,
simply seek the same damages or other relief already claimed in a companion
contract cause of action, they may be disregarded as superfluous as no
additional claim is actually stated.”  (Careau &
Co. v. Security Pacific Business Credit, Inc. (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1371,
1394.)
 
Spectrum
sufficiently alleged a cause of action for breach of the implied covenant
separate and apart from the cause of action for breach of contract.  The gravamen of the breach of contract count
is Avetisyan’s violation of his express contractual obligations specified in XC
¶13 (and Exhibits 1 and 2) when Avetisyan failed to pay Spectrum the $500,000.00
he borrowed by February 1, 2021.  In
contrast, the gravamen of the count for breach of the implied covenant of good
faith and fair dealing is Avetisyan’s alleged efforts to undermine or prevent Spectrum
from receiving the benefits due under contract by fraudulently claiming he
never received the $500,000 and seeking to cancel the DOT securing that
debt.  (XC, ¶¶ 22-24.) 
 
Accordingly, Avetisyan’s demurrer to the second cause of action is OVERRULED.
 
Unjust
Enrichment – Restitution (3rd COA)
Avetisyan demurs to this cause of action on the ground that unjust
enrichment is not a stand-alone cause of action.  
“The elements for a claim of unjust enrichment are receipt of a
benefit and unjust retention of the benefit at the expense of another. The
theory of unjust enrichment requires one who acquires a benefit which may not
justly be retained, to return either the thing or its equivalent to the
aggrieved party so as not to be unjustly enriched.”  (Lyles v. Sangadeo-Patel (2014) 225
Cal.App.4th 759, 769, quotation marks and citations omitted.) 
 
Notably, “[u]njust enrichment is not a cause of action”; it is simply
“a restitution claim.” (Hill v. Roll International Corp. (2011) 195
Cal.App.4th 1295, 1307; see also Melchior v. New Line Productions, Inc.
(2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 779, 793 [“there is no cause of action in California for
unjust enrichment”].)  “Unjust enrichment
is not a cause of action, however, or even a remedy, but rather a general
principle, underlying various legal doctrines and remedies.”  (Rutherford Holdings LLC v. Plaza
Del Rey (2014) 223
Cal.App.4th 221, 231 [citations omitted].) 
“Although some California courts have suggested the existence of a
separate cause of action for unjust enrichment, this court has recently held
that [t]here is no cause of action in California for unjust enrichment.”  (Levine v. Blue Shield of California
(2010) 189 Cal.App.4th 1117, 1138 [ciations omitted].)
 
The Court notes that while Avetisyan cites cases recognizing an
unjust enrichment claim under California law, the more recent cases of Rutherford
Holdings and Levine have confirmed that unjust
enrichment is not a cause of action in California.
 
Accordingly, Avetisyan’s demurrer to the third cause of action is SUSTAINED,
without leave to amend. 
Fraud
And Deceit – Intentional Misrepresentation (4th COA), Negligent
Misrepresentation (5th COA), Fraud And Deceit – Promise Made Without
Intention to Perform (6th COA)
Avetisyan demurs to these three causes of action on the ground that
they were not pled with enough specificity.
 
“The
elements of a cause of action for intentional misrepresentation
are (1) a misrepresentation, (2) with knowledge of its falsity, (3) with the
intent to induce another’s reliance on the misrepresentation, (4) actual and
justifiable reliance, and (5) resulting damage.” (Daniels v. Select
Portfolio Servicing, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 1150, 1166.)  The facts constituting the alleged fraud must
be alleged factually and specifically as to every element of fraud, as the
policy of “liberal construction” of the pleadings will not ordinarily be
invoked.  (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996)
12 Cal.4th 631, 645.)  “[F]raud must be
pled specifically” by “pleading facts which show how, when, where, to whom, and
by what means the representations were tendered.”  (Id.)
 
The
elements of a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation
include “[m]is-representation of a past or existing material fact, without
reasonable ground for believing it to be true, and with intent to induce
another’s reliance on the fact misrepresented; ignorance of the truth and
justifiable reliance on the misrepresentation by the party to whom it was
directed; and resulting damage.”  (Hydro-Mill
Co., Inc. v. Hayward, Tilton & Rolapp Ins. Associates, Inc. (2004) 115
Cal.App.4th 1145, 1154, quotation marks omitted.)  
 
“Promissory
fraud is a subspecies of the action for fraud and deceit. . . . The elements of
promissory fraud (i.e., of fraud or deceit based on a promise made without any
intention of performing it) are: (1) a promise made regarding a
material fact without any intention of performing it; (2) the existence of the
intent not to perform at the time the promise was made; (3) intent to deceive
or induce the promisee to enter into a transaction; (4) reasonable reliance by
the promisee; (5) nonperformance by the party making the promise; and (6)
resulting damage to the promise.”  (Behnke
v. State Farm General Insurance Co. (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1453,
citation and quotation marks omitted.)  The
facts constituting the alleged fraud must be alleged factually and specifically
as to every element of fraud.  (Lazar,
supra, 12 Cal.4th 631, 645.)  To properly allege fraud against a
corporation, the plaintiffs must plead the names of the persons allegedly
making the false representations, their authority to speak, to whom they spoke,
what they said or wrote, and when it was said or written.  (Tarmann v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.
(1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153, 157.) 
 
Spectrum sufficiently alleged all three fraud causes of action with
the requisite specificity.  (See
Opposition to Dem., 8:6-12:3 for a detailed breakdown of the XC’s pleading of
each element of each of the three causes of action.)  In summary, the how is in-person,
orally and in writing.  (XC, ¶¶ 32, 39,
& 46.)  The when is on October
23, 2020.  (Id.)  The where is at 1915 W. Glenoaks Blvd.,
Suite 101, Glendale, CA 91201.  (Id.)
 The to whom is to Spectrum
and Kazarian.  (Id.)  
 
Accordingly, Avetisyan’s demurrer to the fourth, fifth, and sixth
causes of action is OVERRULED. 
Injunctive
Relief (7th COA)
Avetisyan demurs to this cause of action on the ground that injunctive
relief is not a stand-alone cause of action. 

 
“The elements of a cause of action for injunctive relief are (1) a
tort or other wrongful act constituting a cause of action; and (2) irreparable
injury, i.e., a factual showing that the wrongful act constitutes an actual or
threatened injury to property or personal rights which cannot be compensated by
an ordinary damage award.”  (Brownfield
v. Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital (1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 405, 410, citation
omitted.)  Notably, “injunctive relief is
a remedy and not, in itself, a cause of action, and a cause of action must exist
before injunctive relief can be granted.”  (Camp v. Board of Supervisors (1981)
123 Cal.App.3d 334, 356.)
 
In opposition, Spectrum does not provide any authority that shows
that injunctive relief constitutes a cause of action.
 
Accordingly, Avetisyan’s demurrer to the seventh cause of action is
SUSTAINED without leave to amend. 
 
Declaratory
Relief (8th COA) 
Avetisyan demurs to this cause of action on the ground that it is
duplicative of other causes of action in the XC.  
 
“To qualify for declaratory relief, a party would have to demonstrate
its action presented two essential elements: (1) a proper subject of
declaratory relief, and (2) an actual controversy involving justiciable
questions relating to the party’s rights or obligations.”  (Jolley v. Chase Home Finance, LLC
(2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 872, 909, quotation marks and brackets omitted.) 
 
A cause of action for declaratory relief should not be used as a
second cause of action for the determination of identical issues raised in
another cause of action.  (General of
America Insurance Co. v. Lilly (1968) 258 Cal.App.2d 465, 470.)  “The availability of another form of relief
that is adequate will usually justify refusal to grant declaratory relief” (California
Insurance Guarantee Association v. Superior Court (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d
1617, 1624), and a duplicative cause of action is subject to demurrer.  (Palm Springs Villas II Homeowners
Association, Inc. v. Parth (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 268, 290.)  Further, “there is no basis for declaratory
relief where only past wrongs are involved.” 
(Osseous Technologies of America, Inc. v. DiscoveryOrtho Partners LLC
(2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 357, 366, quotation marks omitted.) 
 
            Here, the contract claim has already
accrued, and the only determination required is the ultimate liability of one
party to another.  Spectrum’s declaratory
relief cause of action is based on substantially the same facts as its breach
of contract cause of action, namely Avetisyan’s alleged failure to repay a
$500,000 loan.  This cause of action is unnecessary
and superfluous. 
 
Accordingly, Avetisyan’s demurrer to the eighth cause of action is
SUSTAINED without leave to amend. 
In sum, Avetisyan’s demurrer is SUSTAINED in part and OVERRULED in
part.  The demurrer is SUSTAINED without
leave to amend as to all of Kazarian’s causes of action in the Cross-Complaint,
and as to Spectrum’s causes of action for unjust enrichment, injunctive relief
and declaratory relief.  The motion is OVERRULED
in all other regards.
 
Spectrum is ordered to file an Amended Cross-Complaint reflecting
this order.
 
MOTION
TO STRIKE
            Avetisyan moves to strike from the
XC mentions of and requests for (1) punitive and exemplary damages, (2) special
damages, (3) judicial determination that the DOT and Promissory Note are valid
and enforceable, (4) attorneys’ fees and costs, and (5) restitution and
disgorgement.  (Notice of MTS, pp. 2-3.)
 
Legal Standard
A motion to strike either: (1) strikes any
irrelevant, false or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strikes
any pleading or part thereof not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of
this state, a court rule or order of court.  (CCP § 436, subds. (a)-(b).)  
 
Punitive Damages
Punitive damages may be recovered upon a
proper showing of malice, fraud, or oppression.  (Civ. Code §3294(a).)  Spectrum sufficiently alleged facts supporting
a prayer for punitive damages based on their allegations Avetisyan defrauded Spectrum.
 (XC ¶¶ 27, 33-35, 37, 39-42, 44, 46-50,
52, 54-59.)  
Accordingly, Avetisyan’s motion to strike
allegations pertaining to punitive and exemplary damages is DENIED.
 
Special Damages
Avetisyan contends
that Spectrum did not adequately set forth the amount
of special damages sought, the means for calculating such damages, or the facts
underlying the alleged special damages.  (See Shook v. Pearson (1950) 99 Cal.
App.2d 348, 351-352 [amount and cause of special damages, in conjunction with
the facts and grounds underlying the claim for special damages, must be stated
with particularity].)  Here, the only
mention of special damages in the XC is contained in one line, under the
Spectrum Parties’ prayer for relief.  
 
Accordingly, Avetisyan’s motion to strike allegations
pertaining to special damages is GRANTED.
 
Request for Judicial Determination
            In light of the Court’s ruling on the demurrer to grant
Avetisyan’s demurrer as to the Spectrum Parties’ declaratory relief cause of
action, the motion to strike the request for a judicial determination in the
prayer is GRANTED.
 
Attorneys’ fees and costs
            Avetisyan contends that the XC does not set forth a basis
for the recovery of attorneys’ fees and costs. 
In opposition, Spectrum point out that the DOT provides that Trustor
agrees “[t]o appear in and defend any action or proceeding purporting to affect
the security hereof or affect the security hereof or the rights or powers of
Beneficiary or Trustee; and to pay all costs and expenses, including cost of
evidence of title and attorney’s fees in a reasonable sum, in any such action
or proceeding in which Beneficiary or Trustee may appear, and in any suit
brought by Beneficiary to foreclose this Deed.” 
(DOT, page 3, ¶ 3.)  Further, Civil
Code § 1717 renders such fee provisions reciprocal: “In any action on a
contract, where the contract specifically provides that attorney’s fees and
costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to
one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is determined
to be the party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she is the party
specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's
fees in addition toother costs.”  (Civ.
Code, § 1717(a); see Scott Co. of California v. Blount, Inc. (1999) 20
Cal.4th1103, 1109 [“Section 1717, however, renders the provision mutual, giving
either plaintiff or defendant, if a prevailing party, a right to attorney fees
on any claims based on the contract”].) 
 
            Accordingly, Avetisyan’s motion to
strike allegations pertaining to attorneys’ fees and costs is DENIED.
 
Restitution
Avetisyan moves to strike restitution
from the XC on the ground that the request is “not supported by the allegations
of the” XC because Spectrum is only entitled to general damages based on its
breach of contract claim.  (MTS,
5:25-6:1.)  The Court sustained
Avetisyan’s demurrer to the Spectrum Parties’ restitution cause of action.  However, the fact that restitution is not a
cause of action under California law does not mean that Spectrum cannot claim
it as a remedy.  Avetisyan has not shown
that Spectrum request for restitution is improper under CCP § 436.  
 
Accordingly, Avetisyan’s motion to
strike allegations pertaining to restitution is DENIED.
 
In sum, Avetisyan’s motion to strike
is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. 
The motion is GRANTED as to special damages and requests for judicial
determination.  The motion is DENIED in
all other regards. 
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
 
In consideration of
the current COVID-19 pandemic situation, the Court strongly encourages
that appearances on all proceedings, including this one, be made
by LACourtConnect if the parties do not submit on the tentative.¿¿If
you instead intend to make an appearance in person at Court on this matter, you
must send an email by 2 p.m. on the last Court day before the scheduled date of
the hearing to¿SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org¿stating your intention to appear in
person.¿ The Court will then inform you by close of business that day of
the time your hearing will be held. The time set for the hearing may be at any
time during that scheduled hearing day, or it may be necessary to schedule the
hearing for another date if the Court is unable to accommodate all personal
appearances set on that date.¿ This rule is necessary to ensure that adequate
precautions can be taken for proper social distancing. 
 
Parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to
the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on
the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive
an email and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed
off calendar.
