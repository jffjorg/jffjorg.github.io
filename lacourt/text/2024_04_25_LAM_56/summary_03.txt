And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion to bifurcate the trial and has denied the motion. The judge finds that the continuance of the trial would address all of the concerns raised by Maiden regarding the complexity of the case and the need for additional discovery. The judge orders that the trial be continued to February 19, 2025, and the jury trial date to March 3, 2025. The moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
