[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:
 
PLAINTIFF’S
  MOTION TO APPOINT SUCCESSOR IN INTEREST



 
On February 25, 2022, Plaintiff Joseph Vu (“Plaintiff”) filed this
action against Defendants Keck Medical Center of USC and USC Health System. The
Complaint alleges causes of action for (1) elder abuse and (2) negligence.  
On April 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to appoint
successor in interest. Plaintiff moves “for an order appointing Joseph Vu’s
wife Anh Vu as Successor in Interest to decedent Joseph Vu, the Plaintiff in
this matter…” The motion is unopposed. 
On April 18, 2024, a Stipulation and [Proposed] Order Re: The
Appointment of Anh Vu as Successor in Interest for Joseph Vu and Continuance of
Trial (herein, the “Stipulation”) was filed in this action. The Stipulation provides,
inter alia, that “…THE PARTIES HEREBY STIPULATE AND AGREE: 1. That Anh
Vu, will be appointed in this litigation as the Successor in Interest for
decedent Joseph Vu pursuant to the attached Successor in Interest declaration
attached hereto as Exhibit ‘1’.” 
The Court’s April 19, 2024 minute order in this action indicates that
the “NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS” for this date was “Court Order Re: Stipulation and
Order Re: The Appointment of Anh Vu as Successor In Interest for Joseph Vu and
Continuance of Trial.” The Court’s April 19, 2024 minute order provides, inter
alia, that “[t]he Court, after reviewing the Stipulation and (proposed)
Order, makes the following ruling: The Stipulation is APPROVED and the Order is
signed and filed April 18, 2024 and incorporated herein by reference.” 
In light of the foregoing, the Court finds that Plaintiff’s instant
motion to appoint successor in interest is moot. 
Plaintiff is ordered to
give notice of this Order.¿
