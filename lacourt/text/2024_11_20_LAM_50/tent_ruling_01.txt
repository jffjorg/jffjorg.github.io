[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:
 
APPLICATION TO APPEAR PRO HAC VICE



 
Plaintiff Russell Simmons (“Plaintiff”) moves for an order admitting
Daniel Derby to appear as counsel Pro Hac Vice for Plaintiff in this
action. 
The Court notes two defects with the
application. 
First, pursuant to California
Rules of Court, rule 9.40,
subdivision (c)(1), “[a] person
desiring to appear as counsel pro hac vice in a superior court
must file with the court a verified application together with proof of service
by mail in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure
section 1013a of a copy of the application and of the notice of hearing of
the application on all parties who have appeared in the cause and on the State
Bar of California at its San Francisco office. The notice of hearing must be
given at the time prescribed in Code of Civil
Procedure section 1005 unless the court has prescribed a shorter period.” 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
1005, subdivision (b), “[u]nless otherwise ordered or specifically provided
by law, all moving and supporting papers shall be served and filed at least 16
court days before the hearing.” Sixteen court days prior to the November 20,
2024 hearing is October 28, 2024. Plaintiff’s application was filed after this
date, on October 29, 2024.[1] In
addition, the proof of service attached to the application indicates that the application
was served via email and electronic service on October 29, 2024. Under ¿Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6, subdivision
(a)(3)(B)¿, “[a]ny¿period of notice, or any right or duty to do any act or
make any response within any period or on a date certain after the service of
the document, which time period or date is prescribed by statute or rule of
court, shall be extended after service by electronic means by two court days…” Eighteen
court days before the November 20, 2024 hearing is October 24, 2024.
Second, pursuant to California
Rules of Court, rule 9.40, subdivision (a)(2), no person is eligible to
appear as counsel pro hac vice if the person is “[r]egularly
employed in the State of California.” Although Mr.
Derby states that he is “not regularly engaged in the practice of law in
California” (Derby Decl., ¶ 6), he does not indicate that he is not “[r]egularly employed in the State of California.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 9.40, subd. (a)(2).)  
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s
application is denied without prejudice. Plaintiff
is ordered to provide notice of this
ruling.
