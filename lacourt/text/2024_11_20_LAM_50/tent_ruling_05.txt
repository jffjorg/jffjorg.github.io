  ORDER RE: 
 
PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR TRIAL PREFERENCE



Background 
Plaintiffs Betania Rios; Fernando Ramirez; Zayd Ramirez, by and
through Guardian Ad Litem, Fernando Ramirez; Zia Ramirez, by and through
Guardian Ad Litem, Fernando Ramirez; and Zayra Ramirez, by and through Guardian
Ad Litem, Fernando Ramirez (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed this action on
February 13, 2024 against Defendants Evil Woody, LLC and Weststar Property
Management, Inc. (jointly, “Defendants”). The Complaint alleges causes of
action for (1) breach of implied warranty of habitability, (2) negligence, and
(3) nuisance. 
In the Complaint, Plaintiffs allege, inter alia, that this case
is “about the gross dereliction of duties of landlords that rendered the
dwelling of 5 Plaintiffs unfit for human habitation and detrimental to their
health and safety. Defendants EVIL WOODY, LLC, WESTSTAR PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,
INC.; and DOES 1 through 50 (collectively, ‘Defendants’) and each of them,
owned, operated and/or managed the residential property located at 435 W. 11th
Street, Long Beach, California 90813 (‘the Property’).” (Compl., ¶ 1.) Plaintiffs
allege that “there existed at the Property materially defective conditions
affecting the habitability thereof.” (Compl., ¶ 21.) 
Trial in this matter is currently set for September 17, 2025. 
Plaintiffs now move for preference in setting a date for trial. Defendants
oppose. 
Discussion 
Code of Civil Procedure section 36,
subdivision (b) provides that “[a] civil action to recover damages for
wrongful death or personal injury shall be entitled to preference upon the
motion of any party to the action who is under 14 years of age unless the court
finds that the party does not have a substantial interest in the case as a
whole. A civil action subject to subdivision (a) shall be given preference over
a case subject to this subdivision.” 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
36, subdivision (f), “[u]pon the granting of such a motion for preference,
the court shall set the matter for trial not more than 120 days from that date
and there shall be no continuance beyond 120 days from the granting of the
motion for preference except for physical disability of a party or a party’s
attorney, or upon a showing of good cause stated in the record. Any continuance
shall be for no more than 15 days and no more than one continuance for physical
disability may be granted to any party.” 

Plaintiffs state that the instant motion “is made pursuant to California Civil Procedure Code section 36(b) on the
grounds that named minor plaintiffs ZAYD RAMIREZ; ZIA RAMIREZ; and ZAYRA
RAMIREZ…are under the age of 14, have suffered personal injuries and, in their
capacity as plaintiffs have a substantial interest in the pending action.”
(Mot. at p. 2:5-8.) 
Plaintiffs submit the Declaration of Fernando Ramirez, who states, inter
alia, that “I am a plaintiff in this action. I am the biological father and
guardian ad litem of minor plaintiffs in this action who are under the age of
14. They are: Minor ZAYD RAMIREZ; Date of Birth (‘DOB’): 12/12/2018; Age 5.
Minor ZIA RAMIREZ; DOB: 1/8/20: Age 4. Minor ZAYRA RAMIREZ; DOB: 6/25/21: Age
3.” (Ramirez Decl., ¶ 2.) Fernando Ramirez states that “[m]y children, minor
plaintiffs ZAYD RAMIREZ, ZIA RAMIREZ, and ZAYRA RAMIREZ have resided at the
subject property at 435 W. 11th Street, Long Beach, California
90813 (‘Property’) from on or about May 2021 to present.” (Ramirez Decl., ¶
3.) Fernando Ramirez states that Zayd Ramirez, Zia Ramirez, and Zayra Ramirez “suffered
personal injuries due to the uninhabitable conditions at the Property.”
(Ramirez Decl., ¶¶ 5-7.) 
In the opposition, Defendants state that they “do not dispute the
Minor Plaintiffs are under the age of fourteen (14),” but argue that “[t]he
Minor Plaintiffs do not have a substantial interest in the action as a whole.”
(Opp’n at p. 3:15-16.) Defendants contend that “Plaintiff Fernando Ramirez and
Plaintiff Betania Rios (‘Adult Plaintiffs’) are the two adult tenants in the
present action and are the parties responsible for the Minor Plaintiffs’
residency at the Subject Property as well as for the rental payments at the
Subject Property. Undoubtedly, the Adult Plaintiffs are the in fact the [sic] parties
with a substantial interest in the action.” (Opp’n at p. 3:20-23.) The Court is
not persuaded by this argument and finds that Plaintiffs have shown that Zayd
Ramirez, Zia Ramirez, and Zayra Ramirez have a “substantial interest in the
case as a whole.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 36, subd. (b).)

Zayd Ramirez, Zia Ramirez, and Zayra Ramirez are plaintiffs in the
instant action. Moreover, as discussed, Fernando Ramirez states in his
supporting declaration that Zayd Ramirez, Zia Ramirez, and Zayra Ramirez “suffered
personal injuries due to the uninhabitable conditions at the Property.”
(Ramirez Decl., ¶¶ 5-7.) Fernando Ramirez further states that “[d]ue to the
uninhabitable conditions at the subject Property, minor Zia Ramirez suffered
from headaches, sneezing, coughing, diarrhea, stomach pain, fever, anger,
anxiety, constipation, tongue inflammation, eye irritation and emotional
distress. Minor Zia Ramirez took medication and received medical treatment for
the physical symptoms, among other places, at MemorialCare Medical Group, 2110
N Bellflower Blvd, Long Beach, CA 90815.” (Ramirez Decl., ¶ 5.) Fernando
Ramirez also states that “[d]ue to the uninhabitable conditions at the subject
Property, minor Zayd Ramirez suffered from headaches, sneezing, coughing,
diarrhea, vomiting, stomach pain, fever, irritated [sic], anger, anxiety, and
emotional distress. Minor Zayd Ramriez took medication and received medical
treatment for the physical symptoms at Memorial Care Medical Group, 2110 N 22
Bellflower Blvd, Long Beach, CA 90815.” (Ramirez Decl., ¶ 6.) In addition,
Fernando Ramirez states that “[d]ue to the uninhabitable conditions at the
subject Property, minor Zayra Ramirez suffered from headaches, sneezing,
coughing, diarrhea, stomach pain, fever, irritated [sic], anger, anxiety, and
emotional distress. Minor Zayra Ramirez took medication and received medical
treatment for the physical symptoms at MemorialCare Medical Group, 2110 N
Bellflower Blvd, Long Beach, CA 90815.” (Ramirez Decl., ¶ 7.)
In the opposition, Defendants also assert that “[a]ll information
pertaining the [sic] alleged injuries suffered by the minor children have come
from their attorney and their father Fernando Ramirez, there is no supporting
evidence from any medical professional or from the Minor Plaintiffs’ own
physician(s) who allegedly treated the Minor Plaintiffs for these injuries.”
(Opp’n at p. 4:5-8.) However, Defendants do not cite to any legal authority demonstrating
that Plaintiffs must provide evidence from medical professional in order to show
that the minor plaintiffs “have a substantial interest in the case as a whole”
for purposes of Code of Civil Procedure section 36,
subdivision (b). 
Defendants also cite to Code of Civil Procedure
section 36, subdivision (e), which provides that “[n]otwithstanding any
other provision of law, the court may in its discretion grant a motion for
preference that is supported by a showing that satisfies the court that the
interests of justice will be served by granting this preference.” Defendants
contend that they “will be prejudiced should the Court grant Plaintiff’s motion
pursuant to CCP § 36(e).” (Opp’n at p. 4:14-15.) But
Plaintiffs do not move for trial preference under Code
of Civil Procedure section 36, subdivision (e). As discussed, Plaintiffs
assert that trial preference should be granted in this action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 36, subdivision (b). 
Defendants also argue that “permitting the accelerated trial date
would severely and unduly prejudice the Defendants. Presently, there have been
no depositions scheduled, and the parties have not even attempted mediation,
despite the April 15, 2024 Status Conference regarding Completion of Mediation.”
(Opp’n at pp. 4:27-5:2.) The Court notes that Defendants do not submit any
evidence to support the argument that they would be prejudiced if the instant
motion is granted. 
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have shown
that trial preference is warranted here under Code of Civil Procedure section 36, subdivision (b). 
Conclusion 
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiffs’ motion for trial preference is
granted. The Court sets trial for ______________, 2025, at ______ a.m. The
Final Status Conference is set for ____________, 2025, at ______ a.m., and the
trial readiness and exhibit binders must be lodged in Department 50 by 4
p.m. on __________, 2025.
Plaintiffs are ordered to give notice of this Order.
