[1]Plaintiff notes
that “[a] notice of motion must state in the opening paragraph the nature of
the order being sought and the grounds for issuance of the order.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1110, subd. (a).) 
 


[2]In light of the
foregoing, the Court need not address Defendant’s remaining arguments
pertaining to this cause of action. 


[3]The Court notes
that Defendant raises certain points for the first time in its reply with
respect to the Civil Code section 1782 argument.
However, “¿[p]oints raised for the first time in a reply brief will ordinarily
not be considered, because such consideration would deprive the respondent of
an opportunity to counter the argument.¿” (American
Drug Stores, Inc. v. Stroh (1992)
10 Cal.App.4th 1446, 1453¿.) Thus, the Court declines to consider
the points raised for the first time by Defendant in the reply. 


[4]Defendant argues
for the first time in the reply in support of the motion to strike that “this
action relates only to obligations that did arise from a contract. As such, any
relief under Civil Code section 3294 is improper
and not recoverable.” (Reply at p. 4:14-15.) Defendant did not raise this
argument in the motion. As discussed, “¿[p]oints raised for the first time in a
reply brief will ordinarily not be considered, because such consideration would
deprive the respondent of an opportunity to counter the argument.¿” (American
Drug Stores, Inc. v. Stroh, supra,
10 Cal.App.4th at p.
1453¿.) Thus, the Court declines to consider the arguments raised for
the first time in the reply.
