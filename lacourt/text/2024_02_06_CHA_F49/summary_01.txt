And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the motion to set aside and/or vacate the default. The case is about a breach of warranty of habitability and other related causes of action filed by the plaintiffs on September 22, 2022. The defendants, Chatsworth Garden Apartments, LLC and Parkville, LLC, were served on October 12 and 14, 2022, but did not answer the complaint. A default was entered against them on December 8, 2022. The defendants have now filed a motion to set aside and/or vacate the default, which the plaintiffs have opposed.

The judge has granted the defendants' motion, finding that it is timely and that the failure to file an answer was due to the defendants' attorney's mistake, inadvertence, or neglect. The judge has also ordered the defendants' attorney to pay $1,000.00 in attorney's fees and costs to the plaintiffs' counsel. The default is deemed set aside, and the defendants' answer is deemed filed as of the date of this order.
