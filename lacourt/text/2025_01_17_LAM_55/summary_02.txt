And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for attorney fees and costs in the reduced amount of $41,107.93. The plaintiff had requested $138,688.43 in fees and costs, but the judge reduced this amount based on the reasonableness of the hourly rates and hours billed by the plaintiff's counsel. The judge also declined to award a multiplier to the lodestar fee, as the case was deemed straightforward and the contingent nature of the fee award was already factored into the hourly rate. The defendant did not contest the costs and expenses requested by the plaintiff, and the judge awarded full costs and expenses.
