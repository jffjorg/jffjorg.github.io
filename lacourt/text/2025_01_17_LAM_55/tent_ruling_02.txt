 Case Number:  24STCV08159    Hearing Date:   January 17, 2025    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS: Hearing on Plaintiff's Motion
for Attorney Fees and Costs
 
Plaintiff's Motion for Attorney Fees and Costs is granted
in the reduced amount of $41,107.93.
 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff Abdul Kader
Chowdhury Prince filed this Song Beverly action against BMW of North America, LLC (BMW), Finchey Corporation of California, and Bob Smith VC
Calabassas LLC (Defendants). The
parties agreed to a settlement.
Plaintiff filed a Motion for Attorney Fees requesting fees,
costs, and expenses totaling $138,688.43. Defendant BMW filed an Opposition.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
A prevailing party is entitled to recover costs as a matter
of right. Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subds. (a)(4), (b). Attorney’s fees are also
recoverable as costs when authorized by contract, statute, or law. Code Civ.
Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(10). The moving party bears the burden of
establishing entitlement to attorney fees. Christian Research Institute v.
Alnor (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1320.
Courts begin this inquiry “with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the
number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” PLCM
Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) From there, the “lodestar
figure may then be adjusted [according to a multiplier enhancement] based on
consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the
fair market value for the legal services provided.” Ibid. Relevant
multiplier factors include “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions
involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which
the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, [and]
(4) the contingent nature of the fee award.” Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24
Cal.4th 1122, 1132.
The Court has broad discretion to determine the amount of a
reasonable attorney’s fee award, which will not be overturned absent a
“manifest abuse of discretion, a prejudicial error of law, or necessary
findings not supported by substantial evidence.” Bernardi v. County of
Monterey (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1393-1394.
 
ANALYSIS
I. Motion for Attorney’s Fees
Plaintiff requests $61,740.00 in attorney’s fees. Mot. at p.
2. 
Under Civ. Code § 1794(d), "[i]f the buyer prevails in
an action under [the Song-Beverly Act], the buyer shall be allowed by the court
to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs
and expenses, including attorney's fees based on actual time expended,
determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in
connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action."
In the present case, there is no dispute that Plaintiff is
the prevailing party in this action and is entitled to reasonable attorney fees
and costs. Thus, the only question to be determined by this motion is the award
amount.
 
Plaintiff’s requested attorney fees break down as follows:
Eli Banayan: 71.9 hours at $600 per hour for a total of $42,960.00
Koorosh Banayan: 5 hours at $900 per hour for a total of $4500.00
Yasha Ahoubim: 17.1 hours at $500 per hour for a total of
$8,550.00 
Aaron Cohen: 9.4 hours at $500 per hour for a total of
$4,700.00
Lodestar: $60,890.00[1]
Lodestar Multiplier Requested: $73,068.00[2]
 
1. Reasonableness of Hourly rates
Based on the Court's knowledge of the local legal market and
the low degree of difficulty in this case, the hourly rates requested are not
reasonable. Therefore, the Court will award attorney’s fees at the reduced rate
of $550 per hour for Koorosh Banayan, $400 per hour for Eli Banayan, and $375
for Yasha Ahoubim and Aaron Cohen. 
 
2. Reasonableness of Hours Billed
Defendant challenges Plaintiff’s counsel’s requested fee,
arguing that the record does not support that the reported hours were actually
or reasonably billed. 
A prevailing party's verified billing invoices are prima
facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and services listed were necessarily
incurred. Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682. “In
challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many hours of work are
claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point to the specific
items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to the evidence.” Lunada
Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 240 Cal.App.4th 459, 488 (citation
omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).
The Court agrees that some of the contested hours are
excessive for this routine lemon law case and reduces the hours as follows. 
·        
3.2 hours Eli Banayan billed to prepare a
templated complaint reduced to 0.5 hours.
·        
Eli Banayan billed a combined 6 hours preparing
discovery sets one and two. Because these initial discovery requests are
substantially the same in every lemon law case, the Court reduces time on these
tasks to 3 hours.
·        
Eli Banayan billed 2.8 hours drafting a meet and
confer letter. As this is a straightforward document prepared in every case of
this type, the Court reduces the hours billed to 1.0. 
Additionally, the Court reduces the requested $2,000 for
drafting the motion and reply and attending the hearing to $1,800. 
Accordingly, the Court awards attorney’s fees in the amount
of $40,247.50, which breaks down as follows:
Eli Banayan: 64.4
hours at $400 per hour for a total of $25,760.00
Koorosh Banayan:
5 hours at $550 per hour for a total of $2,750.00
Yasha Ahoubim:
17.1 hours at $375 per hour for a total of $6,412.50
Aaron Cohen: 9.4
hours at $375 per hour for a total of $3,525.00
$1,800 for
preparing the fee motion and reply and attending the hearing
 
3. Lodestar Multiplier
“[T]he lodestar-multiplier method, calculates the fee ‘by
multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended by counsel by a reasonable
hourly rate. Once the court has fixed the lodestar, it may increase or decrease
that amount by applying a positive or negative “multiplier” to take into
account a variety of other factors, including the quality of the
representation, the novelty and complexity of the issues, the results obtained,
and the contingent risk presented.” Laffitte v. Robert Half Internat. Inc.
(2016) 1 Cal.5th 480, 489 (internal quotation omitted). 
Here, Plaintiff misstates how courts perform lodestar
multiplier calculations. As Plaintiff describes it in his motion, the lodestar
is calculated by multiplying hours worked times rate charged, that lodestar is
multiplied by the multiplier, and then the product is added to the original
lodestar. Mot. at p. 2:7-11. This is incorrect. When a court exercises its
discretion to apply a multiplier, the baseline lodestar is multiplied by the multiplier,
yielding the final attorney fee award. See e.g., Warren v. Kia Motors
America, Inc. (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 24, 31 (“[The plaintiff] filed a motion
for attorney fees, seeking $351,055.26 in lodestar fees (the number of attorney
hours worked times the attorneys' hourly rates), plus a lodestar multiplier of
1.5, or an additional $175,527.63, for total requested fees of $526,582.89.”). Because
of this confusion, Plaintiff mistakenly states he is requesting a multiplier of
1.2 when, in fact, he is requesting a multiplier of 2.2. In this case, the
Court declines to award a modifier, as this is a straightforward lemon law case,
and its contingent nature is already factored into the hourly rate.
II. Costs
Plaintiff requests $860.43 in costs and expenses. Defendant
does not contest these costs and expenses. Accordingly, the Court awards full
costs and expenses. 
 
CONCLUSION
Plaintiff's Motion for Attorney Fees and Costs is granted
in the reduced amount of $41,107.93.
