Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Debra Thompson Crowe v. Walmart, Inc., et al. The case involves claims of age discrimination, disability discrimination, and wrongful termination, among others. The plaintiff has moved to amend and augment her expert designation to include additional experts, but the defendants have opposed the motion.

The judge has ruled that the plaintiff lacks standing to bring the motion because she failed to timely serve her initial expert designation. The judge has also ruled that the plaintiff failed to meet the statutory requirements for the relief she seeks.

The judge has denied the motion to amend and augment the expert designation, and has ordered the plaintiff to give notice of the ruling. The judge has also noted that the defendants will be prejudiced if the plaintiff is permitted to add five additional expert witnesses to her list, as this will require additional time to prepare for trial.

Parties who intend to submit on the tentative must send an email to the court indicating their intention to do so. If the parties do not submit on the tentative, they should arrange to appear remotely.
