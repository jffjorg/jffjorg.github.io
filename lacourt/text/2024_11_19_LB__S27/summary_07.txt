Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by General Motors LLC (Defendant) against Mirey A. Ramirez (Plaintiff). The Plaintiff has filed an action against the Defendant for violation of Song-Beverly, breach of warranty, and fraud. The Defendant has demurred to the complaint, alleging that it lacks specificity and fails to plead a transactional relationship between the parties.

The judge has sustained the demurrer on the ground that the complaint lacks specificity, specifically in pleading the who, what, where, when, and how required when pleading fraud. The judge has also denied leave to amend the complaint.

The Defendant has moved to strike the prayer for punitive damages from the complaint, and the judge has granted the motion without leave to amend.

The judge has ordered the Defendant to appear at the hearing and explain what meet and confer attempts were made prior to filing the demurrer. If the attempts are deemed satisfactory, the demurrer will be sustained without leave to amend and the motion to strike will be granted without leave to amend. If the attempts are deemed unsatisfactory, the hearing will be continued to require the parties to meet and confer in good faith.
