And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants. The ruling sustains the demurrer on all stated grounds, meaning that the plaintiff's complaint is defective and must be amended. The judge grants leave to amend the complaint, but requires the plaintiff to meaningfully articulate a legal argument in opposition to each and every stated ground for demurrer in his opposition to the demurrer.

The judge also grants the motion to strike the complaint filed by the co-plaintiff Trust, because a trust cannot be represented by a non-attorney. The plaintiff concedes this issue in opposition to the motion.

The judge orders the plaintiff to amend the complaint within twenty days and requires the defendant to file a responsive pleading within the statutory time thereafter. The judge strongly encourages the plaintiff to retain an attorney if he wishes to maintain his claims successfully.

The judge also sets an order to show cause (OSC) on the same date as the hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike, asking the parties to make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing.
