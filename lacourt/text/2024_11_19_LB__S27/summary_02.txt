And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed a settlement agreement between Bless Enunwa, a minor, and her guardian ad litem (GAL) Ashlee Woolfolk, and the defendants Lomita STEAM Magnet School and Los Angeles Unified School District. The settlement is for $18,000, which will be allocated as follows: $3000 for medical expenses, $4500 for attorneys' fees, and $1562.33 for costs of suit, with the remaining $8937.67 placed in a blocked account. The court finds the settlement fair and reasonable, and the requested fees representing 25% of the gross settlement are also deemed fair and reasonable. The petition to approve the settlement is therefore granted. The court notes that Woolfolk will not personally benefit from the settlement, and wishes to confirm this at the hearing.
