 Case Number:  23LBCV01144    Hearing Date:   November 19, 2024    Dept:  S27 Plaintiffs’ attorney seeks to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff, April
Bellhouse, declaring Plaintiff is in breach of the parties’ attorney-client fee
agreement and has ceased communicating with Counsel.  Notably, Co-Plaintiff, Marlene Bellhouse,
filed a substitution of attorney the day after Counsel filed this motion, and
she is now representing herself in these proceedings.  
 
Counsel declares the moving papers were served on Plaintiff by both mail
and email at a confirmed address; specifically, Counsel declares Plaintiff was
obligated, per the parties’ retainer agreement, to inform Counsel of any change
of address, and also that the parties have communicated consistently through
email, where the papers were also served.
 
The motion is unopposed and granted. 
Relief is effective upon filing proof of service of the final order on
Plaintiff.  
 
Counsel is ordered to give notice.
