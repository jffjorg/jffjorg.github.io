And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is ruling on two motions: one to compel further responses and one to compel PMK deposition. The judge has seen a significant increase in these types of motions in lemon law cases and is frustrated with the lack of cooperation between the parties in resolving these issues. The judge finds that the attorneys are acting in a way that does not benefit their clients and is ordering the parties to meet and confer in good faith to resolve their disputes. The judge is also ordering the parties to file joint statements and briefs if they are unable to resolve their issues. The judge notes that the parties have another discovery motion pending and is continuing the hearing on that motion to February 27, 2025. The judge is also continuing the trial date to March 17, 2025. The judge expects the parties to submit on the tentative and notes that failure to do so may result in the motion being placed off calendar.
