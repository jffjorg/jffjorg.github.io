Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrer filed by General Motors LLC (Defendant) and has found that the complaint filed by Mirey A. Ramirez (Plaintiff) lacks specificity and fails to plead a transactional relationship between the parties. As a result, the court has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.

Additionally, the court has granted the Defendant's motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages from the complaint, as it rises and falls with the fraud cause of action.

The court has also ordered the Defendant to appear at the hearing to explain its meet and confer attempts made prior to filing the demurrer. If the court is satisfied with the attempts, the demurrer will be sustained and the motion to strike will be granted. If not, the hearing will be continued to require the parties to meet and confer in good faith.

The court has also asked the parties to make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike.
