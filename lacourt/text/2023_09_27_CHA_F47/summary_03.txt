## English Text Summary

The judge issued a tentative ruling overruling a demurrer filed by Defendant BBI Capital LLC against Plaintiff Juan Francisco Rodriguez Cortes. 

The demurrer challenged the Plaintiff's claims of General Negligence and Premises Liability, arguing that the complaint lacked sufficient facts. 

The judge found that the Plaintiff's complaint adequately alleged facts to establish BBI's potential liability, including the existence of a duty, breach of that duty, causation, and damages. 

The judge determined that the claims were not redundant and allowed the Plaintiff to proceed with both the General Negligence and Premises Liability claims.
