And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the demurrer filed by BBI Capital LLC to the original complaint is overruled. The demurrer was filed to challenge two of the four causes of action, general negligence and premises liability, against BBI. The judge found that the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to state a cause of action against BBI and that the complaint provides notice of the claims against BBI. The judge concluded that BBI failed to establish that the claims are redundant and that the plaintiff cannot plead them separately. As a result, the answer is due within 20 days.
