SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of a motor vehicle accident that
occurred on 9/30/22 wherein Plaintiff Juan Francisco Rodriguez Cortes
(Plaintiff) was struck by a motor vehicle driven by Defendant Jose Luis Gomez
Ramirez (Ramirez).  (Complaint ¶16).  Plaintiff alleges that Ramirez drove a
vehicle off the road and struck Plaintiff at the intersection of Laurel Canyon
Boulevard and Mercer Street in Los Angeles. 
Id.  Plaintiff alleges that
on or before the accident Defendants Numero Uno, BBI Capital LLC (BBI), Felipe Camacho
Lopez and Does 1-100 owned and/or controlled the land and/or were managing,
controlling, and/or operating a food truck(s), food cart(s), and/or outdoor
cooking equipment (the Street Food Setup) on the land and area where the
accident occurred.  (Complaint ¶27).  
 
Plaintiff also alleges that the foregoing defendants “had
a duty of reasonable and ordinary care to maintain, manage, control and/or
operate their business operations in a safe manner by preventing reasonably
foreseeable dangers presented to their customers/patrons; and to inspect the
Premises and to remove dangerous conditions at the  Premises that impede, prevent, limited,
and/or block sight lines, visibility, and/or the ability of  motorists and pedestrians to avoid each other
in the Street Food Setup area as they navigate the   approximate location where the Crash
occurred.”  (Complaint ¶28; See also
Complaint ¶36).  Plaintiff contends that
these defendants, including BBI, breached such “duties by inviting customers/patrons,
such as Plaintiff, to stand in and around the Premises  while waiting for food at the Street Food
Setup. Defendants NUMERO UNO; BBI; FELIPE; 
AND DOES 1 TO 100 knew, or reasonably should have known, that a motor
vehicle, such as the  Subject Vehicle
operated by Defendant Driver JOSE, was likely to strike one their  customers/patrons. Defendants NUMERO UNO;
BBI; FELIPE; AND DOES 1 TO 100 took no 
precautions to protect their customers/patrons, such as Plaintiff,
from this known and likely risk.” (emphasis added) (Complaint ¶30; See also
Complaint ¶¶37-38).  Further, Plaintiff
alleges that the foregoing breaches caused the accident and Plaintiff’s
resulting injuries.  (Complaint ¶¶32-34,
39-41).   
 
Based on the foregoing, on 4/28/23, Plaintiff filed this
action for: (1) Motor Vehicle Negligence; (2) General Negligence; (3) Premises
Liability; and (4) Dangerous Condition of Public Property.  After meet and confer efforts failed to
resolve the issues BBI had with the complaint, on 7/12/23, BBI filed and served
the instant demurrer to the 2nd cause of action for General
Negligence and the 3rd cause of action for Premises Liability (the
only causes of action alleged against BBI) on the ground that they fail to
allege sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action against BBI.  (See Zadeh Decl.); CCP 430.10(e).  Plaintiff has opposed the demurrer and BBI
has filed a reply to the opposition.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
A demurrer for failure to state a cause of action, such
as the instant demurrer, is referred to as a general demurrer.  (See Demurrer, p.2:6-7, p.3:6-13;
Demurrer Ps&As, p.1:11-13, p.1:25-28, p.2:17-18; Reply, p.2:14-15); McKenney
(2008) 167 CA4th 72, 77; CCP 430.10(e). 
To survive a general demurrer, a plaintiff need only allege sufficient
facts to state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might ultimately
form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.  C.A. (2012) 53 C4th 861, 872.  Any valid cause of action overcomes a general
demurrer.  Quelimane Co., Inc.
(1998) 19 C4th 26, 38-39; Sheehan (2009) 45 C4th 992, 998. 
 
The elements of a negligence cause of action are: (1) a
legal duty, (2) breach of that duty, (3) causation and (4) damages/injury.  Berkley (2007) 152 CA4th 518,
526.  Premises liability is a type of
negligence whereby the owner/occupier of premises has a duty to exercise
ordinary care in the management of such premises to avoid exposing persons to
an unreasonable risk of harm.  See
Brooks (1989) 215 CA3d 1611, 1619. 
The failure to meet such a duty constitutes negligence.  Id. 
  
 
Generally, California is a notice pleading state, meaning
a complaint will be upheld if it provides the defendant with “notice of the
issues sufficient to enable preparation of a defense.”  Doe (2007) 42 C4th 531, 549-550.  A plaintiff only needs to plead such facts as
necessary “to acquaint a defendant with the nature, source and extent of
plaintiff’s claims.  Id.; Prue
(2015) 242 CA4th 1367, 1376; C.A. (2012) 53 C4th 861, 872.  Ordinarily, negligence may be alleged in
general terms, without stating the acts constituting negligence or detailing
the particular manner in which plaintiff's injury occurred.  Berkley, supra at 527.  However, a bare allegation that “defendant's
negligence caused plaintiff injury” is not sufficient.  Id. 
Instead, a plaintiff must allege the acts or omissions of the defendant
that plaintiff claims constitute the negligence.  Id.  

 
The Court finds that Plaintiff has alleged sufficient
facts to put BBI on notice of the basis for Plaintiff’s negligence-based claims
against it.  The complaint contains the
necessary facts to support a finding that BBI owed Plaintiff a duty (Complaint
¶¶27-29, 36), BBI breached that duty (Complaint ¶¶30-32, 34), causation
(Complaint ¶¶33, 40) and resulting damage/injury (Complaint ¶¶34, 39).  BBI can obtain any additional information
necessary to clarify the claims through the discovery process.  
 
While the general negligence and premises liability claims
have the same basic elements, the claims are not necessarily identical (i.e., a
negligence claim is broader).  BBI has
failed to establish at the pleading stage that the claims are redundant and
Plaintiff cannot plead them separately.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The demurrer is overruled.
