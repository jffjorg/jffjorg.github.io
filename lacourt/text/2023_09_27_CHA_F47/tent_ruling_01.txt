SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of a dispute between Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant
Ha Hoang Nguyen (Nguyen) and Defendants/Cross-Complainants Amy Jam (Jam) and Mohsen
Hadad (Hadad)  regarding the rights to
real property located at 20516 Shelley Lane, Porter Ranch, California 91326
(the Property).  Nguyen claims that she
purchased the Property and agreed to let Jam and Hadad live there in exchange
for rent.  Jam and Hadad claim that they
entered an agreement with Nguyen whereby they would live at the property,
manage it up and eventually split the proceeds from the sale of the property
with Nguyen.  
 
On 10/12/22, Nguyen filed this action against Jam and
Hadad for: (1) Breach of Contract, (2) Fraud, (3) Unjust Enrichment and (4)
Declaratory Relief.  On 11/17/22, Jam and
Hadad filed their Answer to the Complaint. 
On 4/17/23, pursuant to their unopposed motion for leave to file a
cross-complaint, Jam and Hadad filed a Cross-Complaint against Nguyen for: (1)
Breach of Contract by Filing for Rent and Pleading Eviction, (2) Breach of
Contract by Not Selling the Property and Not Paying Shares of Jam and Hadad,
(3) Unjust Enrichment, (4) General Negligence, (5) Intentional Tort and (6)
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.
 
On 5/12/23, Nguyen filed and served a Special Motion to
Strike seeking an order striking portions of the Cross-Complaint of
Cross-Complainants Amy Jam and Mohsen Hadad which was granted on 6/7/23.  (See 6/7/23 Minute Order).  On 7/3/23, Nguyen filed and served the
instant motion seeking an order awarding Cross-Defendant Ha Nguyen attorney’s
fees in the amount of $10,928.21 as the prevailing party on a Special Motion to
Strike.  No opposition or other response
to the motion has been filed.
 
ANALYSIS
 
CCP 425.16(c) provides: 
 
“(1) Except as provided in
paragraph (2), in any action subject to subdivision (b), a prevailing defendant
on a special motion to strike shall be entitled to recover that defendant's attorney's fees and costs.
If the court finds that a special motion to strike is frivolous or is solely
intended to cause unnecessary delay, the court shall award costs and reasonable
attorney's fees to a plaintiff prevailing on the motion, pursuant to Section
128.5.
 
(2) A defendant who prevails on a
special motion to strike in an action subject to paragraph (1) shall not be
entitled to attorney's fees and costs if that cause of action is brought
pursuant to Section 11130, 11130.3, 54960,
or 54960.1
of the Government Code, or pursuant to Chapter 2
(commencing with Section
7923.100) of Part 4 of Division 10 of Title 1 of the Government Code.
Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent a prevailing defendant
from recovering attorney's fees and costs pursuant to Section 7923.115, 11130.5, or
54960.5 of the Government Code.”
 
Nguyen’s counsel indicates that 27.16 hours of attorney
time at $400/hour was spent researching and preparing the underlying special
motion to strike, reviewing the opposition, preparing the reply and preparing
for and appearing at the hearing.  (See
Ames Decl.).  Additionally, Nguyen
incurred $68.91 in costs associated with the underlying motion.  The Court finds the uncontested fees and
costs to be reasonable. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted. 
Pursuant to CCP 425.16(c), Nguyen is awarded $10,928.21 in attorney’s
fees and costs as the prevailing party on the Special Motion to Strike.
