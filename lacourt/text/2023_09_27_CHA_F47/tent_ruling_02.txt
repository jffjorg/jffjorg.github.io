Petition filed on 4/10/23.
 
MOVING PARTY: Petitioner E.A., a minor, by
and through her Guardian ad Litem, J.A.

RESPONDING PARTY : Respondent County of Los Angeles
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order
pursuant to Government Code 946.6 relieving Petitioner from the requirements of
Government Code 945.4.  Alternatively,
Petitioner seeks an order that she has substantially complied with said
requirements.  
 
RULING: The hearing will be continued.  
 
On 4/10/23, Petitioner E.A., a minor, by and through her
Guardian ad Litem, J.A. filed the instant petition seeking an order pursuant to
Government Code 946.6 relieving Petitioner from the requirements of Government
Code 945.4.  Alternatively, Petitioner
seeks an order that she has substantially complied with said requirements.  The proof of service attached to the petition
indicates that it was served on 4/10/23 via Federal Express on the Office of
the City Attorney for the City of Los Angeles and Carl Warren & Company for
the County of Los Angeles.
 
On 5/4/23, the Court issued a Minute Order setting the
hearing on the petition for 8/22/23 and ordered Petitioner to give notice to
any required parties/entities.
 
On 7/26/23, Petitioner filed two proofs of service indicating
that on 7/24/23, the City of Los Angeles (City) and the County of Los Angeles
(County) were both served by leaving the following documents with Dee Gentry,
Deputy Clerk:  
 
CLAIM AGAINST A PUBLIC ENTITY;
ADDENDUM TO CLAIM AGAINST COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES AND CITY OF LOS ANGELES, PUBLIC
ENTITIES, ITS AGENTS AND EMPLOYEES, DEPARTMENTS, AND SUBCONTRACTORS; NOTICE OF
PETITION AND PETITION FOR ORDER RELIEVING PLAINTIFF FROM GOVERNMENT ENTITY
CLAIM FILING REQUIREMENTS OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, FOR AN ORDER THAT PLAINTIFF
HAS SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLIED WITH SAID REQUIREMENTS; MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND
AUTHORITIES; CIVIL CASE COVER SHEET; CIVIL CASE COVER SHEET ADDENDUM AND
STATEMENT OF LOCATION; FIRST AMENDED GENERAL ORDER; NOTICE OF CASE ASSIGNMENT
UNLIMITED CIVIL CASE; VOLUNTARY EFFICIENT LITIGATION STIPULATIONS; ORDER
PURSUANT TO CCP 1054(a), EXTENDING TIME TO RESPOND BY 30 DAYS WHEN PARTIES
AGREE TO EARLY ORGANIZATIONAL MEETING STIPULATION; ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE
RESOLUTION (ADR) INFORMATION PACKAGE
 
There is no evidence that the City or County were served
with notice that the hearing on the petition is scheduled for 8/22/23 and the
“Hearing Date” sections of the proofs of service are blank.  There are no oppositions/responses to the
petition to cure this defect.  
 
The Court also notes that although the application
indicates that it is brought by Petitioner E.A., a minor, by and through her
Guardian ad Litem, J.A., an application for appointment of guardian ad litem
has not been filed.  Further, in order to
have a guardian ad litem appointed under a pseudonym (i.e., by initials), the
procedures set forth in CCP 372.5 must be followed.
