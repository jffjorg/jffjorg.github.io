  - "The burden is on the cross-complainant to produce evidence that would be admissible at trial—i.e., to proffer a prima facie showing of facts supporting a judgment in cross-complainant's favor."

Summary:

The judge grants the unopposed special motion to strike the first amended cross-complaint of pro per Cross-Complainant Hormoz Pourat against Cross-Defendant Robert Gentino. Gentino alleged that Hormoz's cause of action against him arises from protected activity, specifically the sending of emails in connection with litigation. The judge found that Gentino met his burden to show that the cause of action against him arises from protected activity and that Hormoz failed to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on the merits. The judge also notes that even if Hormoz had met his burden, his allegations would be protected by the litigation privilege.
