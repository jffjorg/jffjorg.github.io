  - "The Court finds that a stay of the 'non-individual' PAGA claims is warranted, particularly to avoid inconsistent rulings."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to stay the plaintiff's non-individual PAGA claims pending the completion of arbitration of the plaintiff's individual PAGA claims. The judge found that a stay is warranted to avoid inconsistent rulings and to conserve judicial resources. The plaintiff had argued that the court should allow the non-individual PAGA claims to proceed despite the pending arbitration, but the judge disagreed, citing the California Supreme Court's decision in Adolph v. Uber Technologies, Inc. The judge set an arbitration completion status conference for January 16, 2026, and ordered the parties to file a joint report regarding the status of the arbitration.
