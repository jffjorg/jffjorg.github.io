And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for default judgment against the defendant, Rives Grogan. The plaintiff had previously filed a request for default judgment, but it was denied due to several deficiencies. The plaintiff's counsel then filed a declaration to correct these deficiencies, but the court still denied the request. The main reason for the denial was that the documents submitted by the plaintiff requested principal damages in the amount of $488,325.48, which is more than the amount identified in the statement of damages served upon the defendant, which was $400,000.00. The court noted that it may not award damages in excess of those identified in the statement of damages.
