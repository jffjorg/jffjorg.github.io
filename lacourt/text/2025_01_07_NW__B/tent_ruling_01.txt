Re:                         21STCV05058 David Medina vs Rives Grogan, et
al.

 

 
Plaintiff David Medina’s Request for Default
Judgment
 
Defendant: Rives Grogan
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff David Medina’s request for
default judgment against Defendant Rives Grogan is DENIED.
            
BACKGROUND
 
This is a
personal injury action. On February 9, 2021, Plaintiff David Medina
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants Rives Grogan (“Grogan”), New
Beginnings Christian Discipleship (“New Beginnings”), GM Service (“GM”), and
Does 1 through 25 (collectively “Defendants”), alleging two causes of action:
(1) general negligence; and (2) premises liability.
 
On June 5,
2024, the case was reassigned to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B
at Van Nuys Courthouse East, effective June 24, 2024.
 
On August 1,
2024, Plaintiff filed a request for default judgment. On December 2, 2024, the
Court denied the request for deficiencies. 
 
On December
20, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel filed a declaration allegedly correcting these
deficiencies. The Court now considers Plaintiff’s default packet and most
recent declaration.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 585 permits
entry of a default judgment after a party has failed to timely respond or
appear. (CCP § 585.) A party seeking judgment on the default by the court must
file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2)
declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested;
(3) interest computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and
disbursements; (5) declaration of nonmilitary status; (6) a proposed form of
judgment; (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or
an application for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for
attorney’s fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal.
Rules of Court Rule 3.1800.) 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiff
seeks damages in the total amount of $490,718.81, representing $188,325.48 in
special damages, $300,000.00 in general damages, and $2,393.33 in costs.
 
Plaintiff’s
most recent request for default judgment was denied for the following
deficiencies:
 
1.       Plaintiff failed to file a CIV-100
requesting default judgment. (CRC 3.1800(a).)
2.       Plaintiff failed to file a JUD-100 or
other proposed order. (CRC 3.1800(a)(6).)
3.       Plaintiff requests attorney’s fees
but fails to provide a retainer agreement or other statutory basis for
attorney’s fees. (Cal. Civ. Code § 1715(a); CRC 3.1800(a)(9).)
 
(See December
2, 2024, Minute Order.)
 
On December
20, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel submitted a declaration to correct these
deficiencies. The Court now considers Counsel’s declaration.
 
CIV-100
 
First, Plaintiff’s
counsel provides a CIV-100 requesting default judgment which was filed on April
25, 2024. (Paredes Decl. ¶ 4 Exh. B [April 25, 2024, CIV-100].) This CIV-100
meets all statutory requirements. Therefore, Plaintiff satisfies the
requirement for a CIV-100 form requesting default judgment.
 
JUD-100
 
Plaintiff’s
counsel provides a JUD-100 proposed order which was filed on April 25, 2024.
(Paredes Decl. ¶ 5 Exh. C [April 25, 2024, JUD-100].) This JUD-100 meets all
statutory requirements. Therefore, Plaintiff satisfies the requirement for a
JUD-100 or other proposed order.
 
Attorney’s
Fees/Costs
 
The April 25,
2024, CIV-100 requests costs in the amount of $2,393.33 instead of attorney’s
fees. (See Paredes Decl. ¶ 4 Exh. B Item 2.) Additionally, Plaintiff
provides a memorandum of costs as Item 7 on the CIV-100 and Exhibit D of
counsel’s declaration. Therefore, Plaintiff meets all statutory requirements
for requesting costs in the amount of $2,393.33.
 
Plaintiff’s
alleged deficiencies identified in the Court’s December 2, 2024, order have
been remedied. However, upon review of the April 25, 2024, CIV-100 and JUD-100,
the Court notes that both documents request principal damages in the amount of
$488,325.48, while the statement of damages served upon Defendant identify
principal damages in the amount of $400,000.00. (See Paredes Decl. Exh.
B [April 25, 2024, CIV-100], Exh. C [April 25, 2024, JUD-100], and Plaintiff’s Summary
of the Case Exh. B [Statement of Damages].) A court may not award damages in
excess of those identified in the statement of damages. (CCP § 580.) Therefore,
Plaintiff’s request for default judgment is DENIED on the basis of this
deficiency.
