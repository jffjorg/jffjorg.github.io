And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is in regards to a petition to confirm an arbitration award in favor of Christina Lindsey Orta against Securities America, Inc. The case began with a Statement of Claim filed by Donna Hall and George Hall, Jr. against Securities America, Inc. in 2021, which was later settled for a nominal amount. Orta filed a motion to expunge Central Registration Depository (CRD) records in 2023, which was granted. The arbitrator made a finding of fact that Orta made suitable recommendations and performed her duties as a representative in a thorough, ethical, and professional manner. The arbitrator also reviewed the settlement documentation and considered the amount of payment made. The arbitrator reviewed documentary evidence and other evidence in the matter, including Orta's testimony. The petition to confirm the arbitration award was filed timely, and the petition discussed the substance of the arbitration agreement, named the arbitrator, and attached a copy of the award. The jurisdiction and venue were satisfied since the arbitration took place in Los Angeles. However, the Court finds that the matter should be continued due to a defect in the notice of hearing, which needs to be fixed and a new notice needs to be served before the petition can be granted.
