TENTATIVE RULING
 
The hearing on the petition to confirm arbitration award is
continued.  Petitioner needs to serve a
corrected notice of hearing.
 
BACKGROUND
 
Petitioner describes the case this way:
 
George Hall, Jr. and
Donna Hall (collectively, “the Halls”) filed a Statement of Claim with [the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”)] on June 15, 2021 naming
Securities America, Inc. as the Respondent in the action styled Donna T.
Hall and George E. Hall Jr., as Trustees of the Hall Trust DTD 3/23/15 v.
Securities America, Inc., FINRA No. 21-01517 (“Hall Action”). [Citation.]
The claims related to the handling of their investment account at SAI,
specifically the purchase of a select few investments. [Citation.] Orta was not
named as a Respondent in the Hall Action. 
 
On October 26, 2022,
the Hall Action was settled and the case was then dismissed. [Citation.] The
Hall Action settled for a nominal amount, namely to obviate litigation fees and
costs. [Citation.] Orta did not contribute to the settlement amount nor was she
asked to participate in, or contribute to, the settlement. [Citation.] 
 
On April 13, 2023,
Petitioner filed a motion to expungement of all references of the Hall Action
from her Central Registration Depository (“CRD”) records in a new FINRA matter
styled Christina Lindsey Orta vs. Securities America, Inc., FINRA Case
No. 23-00977. [Citation.] A hearing took place on October 16, 2023. Respondent
to the Petition did not oppose the request for expungement. [Citation.]
Furthermore, the Halls were notified of the hearing and their right to appear
via telephone, and elected to not participate or attend the hearing.
[Citation.] On October 18, 2023, the Chair issued an award granting
expungement. [Citation.] The Panel made the following affirmative finding of
fact: “[t]he claim, allegation, or information is factually impossible or clearly
erroneous” and “[t]he claim, allegation, or information is false.” [Citation.]
The Panel made the finding based on, among other things, the following reasons:
“[Orta] made suitable recommendations and performed her duties as a
representative in a thorough, ethical, and professional manner.” [Citation.]
The Chair also reviewed the settlement documentation, considered the amount of
payment made, and considered the relevant terms and conditions of the
settlement. [Citation.] The Chair also reviewed the documentary evidence and
other evidence in the matter, including Orta’s testimony. [Citation.] 
 
(Petition, pp. 3-4, underlining of case names added.)
 
Here, Petitioner moves to confirm the arbitration award.
 
LAW
 
“Until an arbitration award is confirmed (or vacated), it has
only the effect of a contract in writing between the parties.”  (Knight, et al., Cal. Practice Guide:
Alternative Dispute Resolution (The Rutter Group December 2023 Update) ¶
5:527.) 
 
“The procedure by which the prevailing party obtains an
enforceable judgment is a petition to confirm the award.”  (Ibid.)
 
“Any party to an arbitration in which an award has been made
may petition the court to confirm . . . the award.  The petition shall name as respondents all
parties to the arbitration and may name as respondents any other persons bound
by the arbitration award.”  (Code Civ.
Proc. § 1285.)
 
“A petition to confirm is subject to jurisdiction, venue and
procedural requirements similar to a motion to vacate or correct the award[.]”  (Knight, supra, at ¶ 5:534.)
 
“Anyone agreeing in California to arbitrate a dispute here is
subject to the personal jurisdiction of California courts in proceedings to
confirm the award.”  (Id. at ¶ 5:535.)
 
“Under California law, a petition to confirm an award must be
filed in the county where the arbitration was held.”  (Id. at ¶ 5:535.5.)
 
In terms of procedural requirements, the petition must:
 
(a) Set forth the substance of or have attached a copy of
the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies the existence of such
an agreement.
 
(b) Set forth the names of the arbitrators.
 
(c) Set forth or have attached a copy of the award and
the written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.
 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 1285.4.)  And it “must be served and filed at least 10
days, and no later than four years, after service of the award on the
petitioner.”  (Knight, supra, at ¶
5:532.)
 
Notably, “[u]nless a petition to correct or vacate the award
has been timely filed, the court must render a judgment confirming the
arbitrator’s award.”  (Knight, supra, at
¶ 5:528; see also Code Civ. Proc. § 1286 [“If a petition or response under this
chapter is duly served and filed, the court shall confirm the award as made,
whether rendered in this state or another state, unless in accordance with this
chapter it corrects the award and confirms it as corrected, vacates the award
or dismisses the proceeding.”].)
 
“[A] statement of decision explaining the superior court’s
decision on the principal controverted issues is not required unless timely
requested by one of the parties.” 
(Knight, supra, at ¶ 5:537.)  
 
“Absent a timely request, the appellate court will imply the superior court made whatever findings are necessary to support the judgment.”  (Id. at ¶ 5:537.1, emphasis in original.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
The following factors support confirming the arbitration
award:
 
* The petition is timely. 
(See Weaver Decl., ¶ 9 [declaring that the arbitrator served the award
on the parties on October 18, 2023, which is less than four years before
Petitioner filed the petition on January 18, 2024].)
 
* The petition discusses the substance of the arbitration
agreement, names the arbitrator, and attaches a copy of the award.  (See Petition, p. 3; see also Weaver Decl., ¶
10, Ex. C.)
 
* Jurisdiction and venue are satisfied since the arbitration
took place in Los Angeles.  (See
Petition, p. 3.)
 
* The petition is unopposed.
 
* No party has filed a motion to vacate or correct the award.
 
* Confirmation is mandatory in the absence of a timely motion
to vacate or correct.
 
* The record lacks evidence identifying a basis to vacate or
correct.
 
Nevertheless, the Court finds that the matter should be
continued.  The notice of hearing that
Plaintiff served and filed on March 19, 2024 lists the Stanley Mosk Courthouse
as to site for the confirmation hearing instead of the Spring Street
Courthouse.  (See 3/19/24 Notice of
Hearing, p. 1.)  This defect needs to be
fixed, and a new notice needs to be served, before the petition can be granted.
