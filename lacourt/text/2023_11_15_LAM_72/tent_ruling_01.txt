 Calendar
  Number:  1



 
 
 
Plaintiffs Lorenza and Fernando Salvatierra move
to enforce the settlement with Defendant Teresa Alvarez pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure §664.6.  Plaintiffs
request entry of judgment in the amount of the outstanding balance under the
settlement agreement, $12,250.
 
The motion to enforce settlement
agreement pursuant to CCP §664.6 is granted. 
The dismissal entered on July 29, 2021 is set aside and judgment shall
be entered in favor of Plaintiffs and against Defendant in the amount of
$12,250.  Plaintiffs shall prepare the
judgment.
 
Background
 
          Plaintiffs Lorenza and Fernando Salvatierra were
residential tenants of Defendant Teresa Alvarez.  Plaintiffs allege the property was infested
with vermin and uninhabitable. 
Plaintiffs allege Defendant collected rent for three years despite
refusing to perform repairs or abate any of the slum conditions at the
property.  
 
          On
November 12, 2019, Plaintiffs filed a complaint against Defendant Alvarez
alleging (1) breach of the implied warranty of habitability; (2) breach of the
common law duty of care; (3); breach of the common law implied of covenant of
quiet enjoyment; (4) violation of Civil Code §1714 (negligent maintenance of
premises); (5) violation of Civil Code §1714 (Negligent hiring and supervision);
(6) violation of B&PC §17200.  
 
           On July 16, 2021, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of
Settlement.  On July 26, 2021, a
Stipulation and Order was granted and entered. 
On July 29, 2021, Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the action against
Defendant Teresa Alvarez. 
 
          On
September 5, 2023, Plaintiffs filed this motion to enforce the settlement
agreement.  On October 10, 2023,
Defendant Teresa Alvarez filed an opposition, stating that she does not have
funds to pay because of an injury, but her daughter has indicated she is
willing to make payments of $300 a month. 

 
          On
October 12, 2023, the Court granted Defendant Teresa’s Alvarez’s oral request
to continue the hearing on the motion. 
Defendant argued that she would be able to come current on the payments
and asked for some time to resolve the issue. 
The Court granted the extension but has not heard any information about
a resolution of this matter.
 
Legal Standard
 
           “If parties to pending litigation stipulate,
in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If
requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to
enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.”  (CCP §664.6.)  
 
          “Section
664.6 was enacted to provide a summary procedure for specifically enforcing a
settlement contract without the need for a new lawsuit.”  (Weddington Productions, Inc. v. Flick
(1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793, 809.)  “The
statute recognizes that a settlement may be summarily enforced in either of two
situations: where the settlement was made orally before the trial court or
where it was made in writing outside the presence of the court.”  (Elyaoudayan v. Hoffman (2003) 104
Cal.App.4th 1421, 1428.)  Disputes
regarding the terms of the settlement (or other disputed facts) may be
adjudicated on a CCP § 664.6 motion, on the basis of declarations or other
evidence.  (Malouf Bros. v. Dixon
(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 280, 284.)
 
           Once an action is dismissed, the court loses
jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter of the suit.  (Wackeen v. Malis (2002) 97
Cal.App.4th 429, 437.)  However, pursuant
to CCP §664.6, “[i]f requested by the parties, the court may retain
jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in
full of the terms of the settlement.” 
Thus, a court may retain jurisdiction under CCP 664.6, notwithstanding
dismissal, but only if a proper request for retention of jurisdiction is made
by the parties.  (Id. at 439-440
(unless parties presented trial court with a proper request to retain jurisdiction
for purposes of section 664.6 motions, trial court did not have subject matter
jurisdiction over action to enforce settlement post-dismissal.))
 
Discussion
 
          Plaintiffs and Defendant entered
into a settlement agreement on July 14, 2021. 
(July 26, 2021 Stipulation and Order.) 
Pursuant to the settlement agreement, Defendant would pay Plaintiffs
$31,000 in full settlement of this litigation. 
Defendant would pay the $31,000 in accordance with the following
schedule:  (1) an initial payment of
$3000 within 5 days of execution of the agreement; and (2) payment of the
remaining $28,000 in monthly installments of $750, commencing on August 1,
2021.  (Id. at ¶1, “Settlement
Payment.”)  
 
          Defendant failed to make timely
payments for August 2022, September 2022, November 2022, December 2022 and
March 2023.  (Motion, Hong Dec., ¶¶2-6.)  Defendant ultimately made the August,
September November and December payments after Plaintiffs informed Defendant
she was in breach of the settlement agreement (Id. at ¶¶2-6.)  Defendant’s last payment was made in April
2023.  Defendant has not cured the default
despite Plaintiffs’ requests that she do so. 
(Id. at ¶¶6-9.)  Defendant
has paid $18,750 of the $31,000 settlement. 
(Id. at ¶10.)  There
remains $12,250 outstanding on the settlement. 
(Id. at ¶10.)
          Defendant is in breach of
the Settlement Agreement.  The Court
retained jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement pursuant to CCP
§664.6 in the July 26, 2021 Stipulation and Order.  (July 26, 2021 Stipulation and Order, p. 4.)  
          The Court recognizes that
there is a practical reason that Defendant has not paid:  she asserts that she has been injured and
cannot and is offering to have her daughter make partial payments.  The stipulated settlement agreement by its
terms does not make an exception in that circumstance.  The Court encourages the parties to agree to
a payment schedule even after the Court issues a judgment for the full
amount.
