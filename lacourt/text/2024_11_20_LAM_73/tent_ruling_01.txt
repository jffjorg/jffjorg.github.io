TENTATIVE
RULING 
 
The
Petition to Correct and Confirm Arbitration Award is GRANTED.
 
Respondents Lee Capital Builders, Inc. and John Lee, a/k/a Kyung
Je John Lee, or Kyung Je Lee shall jointly and severally pay to Petitioner 207
Entrada LLC the sum of $284,354.07, plus interest at the statutory rate from

I. BACKGROUND
 
On December 20, 2019, Plaintiff Lee Capital Partners LLC filed
this action against Defendant Mandeville Capital LLC. 
 
Plaintiff alleged the following causes of action:
1.      Breach of
Contract;
2.      Foreclosure
of Mechanics Lien; and
3.      Labor and
Services Rendered.
The Complaint
alleges the following. On or about June 1, 2017, Plaintiff and Defendant
entered into a written contract whereby Plaintiff agreed to perform certain
construction work at Defendant’s property. Plaintiff alleges that it performed
work, labor and services pursuant to the agreement. Plaintiff further alleges
that Defendant failed to pay Plaintiff for any work performed. 
On October 7, 2024, Defendant filed a Petition to Correct and
Confirm the Arbitration Award:
·      
This action was filed by Lee Capital Builders, Inc. in 2019, and
thereafter was consolidated or related with two other pending actions, one
pending in this Court and the other in the Santa Monica branch, including
cross-actions and cross-complaints.
·      
The subject matter of the litigation involves a dispute between
the parties and their principals, Alexander Edmunds and John Lee, over two real
estate projects in Santa Monica, the first located on 11th Street and the
second on Entrada Avenue, and specifically the validity, quality and value of
Mr. Lee’s work on the projects as contractor.
·      
The arbitration award was made on July 1, 2024, by arbitrator Hon.
Lisa Hart Cole.
·      
Thereafter, the parties negotiated a settlement of the 11th Street
portion of the case only, but were unable to settle the 207 Entrada portion of
the case.
·      
The parties have therefore agreed the final Judgment to be entered
should not include the Arbitrator’s Award on 11th Street, but only 207 Entrada.
 
No opposition was filed.
II.
DISCUSSION
 
“Any party to an arbitration in which an award has been made may
petition the court to confirm, correct or vacate the award.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1285.)  The petition must set forth (1) the substance of or have
attached a copy of the agreement to arbitrate, (2) the names of the
arbitrators, and (3) the award and the written opinion of the arbitrators, or
attach a copy.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.4.)  If such a petition is
filed, the court must confirm the award unless it corrects the award and
confirms it as corrected, vacates the award, or dismisses the proceeding. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1286.) Where the petition is served but no response is
served and filed, the allegations in the petition are deemed admitted. 
(CCP § 1290; Taheri Law Group, A.P.C. v. Sorokurs (2009) 176 Cal.App.4th
956, 962.)    
 
Every presumption is in favor of the arbitration award. (See Firestone
Tire & Rubber Co. v. United Rubber Workers of America (1959) 168
Cal.App.2d 444, 449.) CCP section 1286.2 provides that “the court shall vacate
the award if the court determines any of the following: (1) [t]he award was
procured by corruption, fraud or other undue means.” (CCP § 1286.2(a).) The
defendant moving for vacation of an arbitration award due to corruption, fraud,
or other undue means must demonstrate a nexus between the award and the alleged
undue means used to attain it. (See Pour Le Bebe, Inc. v. Guess? Inc.
(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 810, 833-34.) An objection to the granting of a motion
to confirm an award is equivalent to a motion to vacate. (See Thriftimart,
Inc. v. Superior Court (1962) 202 Cal.App.2d 421, 425-26.) 
 
A.     
Arbitration Award
 
Here, the petition complies with Code of Civil Procedure section
1285.4.  The petition includes a copy of the parties’ agreement to
arbitrate.  (Attachment 4(b).)  Hon. Lisa Hart Cole served as the
arbitrator and issued the final arbitration award on July 1, 2024.  A copy
of the arbitration award is attached to the petition.  (Attachment 8(c).) 

 
According to
the petition, Petitioner requests the Court correct the award and enter
judgment according to the corrected award. Petitioner states that after the
arbitrator’s final award in favor of Petitioners was issued on July 1, 2024,
the parties entered into settlement discussions. (Attachment 10b(3).) The
subject matter of the litigation involves a dispute between the parties and
their principals, Alexander Edmunds and John Lee, over two real estate projects
in Santa Monica, the first located on 11th Street and the second on Entrada
Avenue, and specifically the validity, quality and value of Mr. Lee’s work on
the projects as contractor. On or about July 16, 2024, the parties reached an agreement on
that portion of this case pertaining to the 11th Street Project, and
disbursement of the proceeds being held in the Client Trust Account of Michael
Fehmel, Esq. They dismissed their claims against each other with respect solely
to that project. Therefore, although the award made a finding in favor of
Petitioners on the 11th Street Project and ordered that Lee pay money, that parties
request that the final Judgment should be limited to the smaller 207 Entrada
Project in the amount ordered by the Arbitrator, $284,354.07. (Ibid.)
 
 
The arbitrator’s findings with respect to 207 Entrada were as
follows: 
 
“Final
Calculation 
CORE
Consulting Entitlement to Lee                             $182,778.33 
Net unrepaid
loan proceeds retained by Lee       -$425,432.40

Direct
payment by Mandeville to Lee                            -$41,700.00

NET AWARD TO
207 ENTRADA LLC                                $284,354.07”
 
(Attachment 8(c), p. 5.)
 
Respondent has not opposed the Petition, and the Court does not
have any reason to vacate the award or dismiss the proceedings. 
 
Based on the above, the Court GRANTS the Petition to correct and
confirm the arbitration award. Respondents Lee Capital Builders, Inc. and John Lee, a/k/a Kyung
Je John Lee, or Kyung Je Lee shall jointly and severally pay to Petitioner 207
Entrada LLC the sum of $284,354.07, plus interest at the statutory rate from
the date of entry of this Judgment.
 
III. DISPOSITION
 
The
Petition to Correct and Confirm Arbitration Award is GRANTED.
 
Respondents Lee Capital Builders, Inc. and John Lee, a/k/a Kyung
Je John Lee, or Kyung Je Lee shall jointly and severally pay to Petitioner 207
Entrada LLC the sum of $284,354.07, plus interest at the statutory rate from
the date of entry of this Judgment.
