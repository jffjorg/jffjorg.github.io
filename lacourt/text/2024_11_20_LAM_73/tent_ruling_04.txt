I. BACKGROUND
 
On May 24,
2024, Plaintiff Merik Migliore filed the instant action against Defendants FC
US LLC, Premier Automotive of Placentia, LLC dba Premier Chrysler Dodge Jeep
Ram of Buena Park (“PA”) and Does 1-100, alleging the following causes of
action:
1.      Violation of Subdivision
(d) of Civil Code section 1793.2
2.      Violation of Subdivision
(b) of Civil Code section 1793.2
3.      Violation of Subdivision
(a)(3) of Civil Code section 1793.2
4.      Breach of
Express Warranty
5.      Breach of
Implied Warranty
6.      Negligent
Repair
Plaintiff alleges this action arises out of the warranty
obligations of Defendants in connection with a vehicle purchased by Plaintiff
and for which Defendants issued a written warranty. 
On September 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Motion
for Order establishing Defendant PA’s admissions to Plaintiff’s Requests for
Admission, Set One. No opposition was filed.
 
II. ANALYSIS
 
A.      Legal
Standard 
 
Where there
has been no timely response to a request for admissions under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction.  (CCP §
2033.280(b).)  The party who has failed to respond waives any objections
to the demand, unless the court grants that party relief from the waiver, upon
a showing (1) that the party has subsequently served a substantially compliant
response, and (2) that the party’s failure to respond was the result of
mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  (CCP §
2033.280(a)(1-2).)  The court “shall” grant a motion to deem admitted
requests for admissions, “unless it finds that the party to whom the requests
for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion,
a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (CCP § 2033.280(c).) 
 
If a party to
whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely response, the
requesting party may move for a monetary sanction. (Code of Civ. Proc.§
2033.280(b).) “It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction…on the
party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to
requests for admission necessitated this motion.” (Code of Civ. Proc. §
2033.280(c).
 
B.      Discussion
On July 5,
2024, Plaintiff served Requests for Admission (Set One) on Defendant PA. (Azimtash Decl., ¶ 3,
Ex. A.) The responses were due on or about August 7, 2024. As of the date of
this motion, no requests for an extension of time or responses have been served.
(Id. at ¶ 8.) No opposition to Plaintiff’s motion has been filed. As such, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion.
III. DISPOSITION
 

Plaintiff’s
Motion for Order establishing Defendant Premier
Automotive of Placentia, LLC dba Premier Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram of Buena Park’s admissions to Plaintiff’s Requests for
Admission, Set One, is GRANTED. The Court deems the requests to be admitted.
