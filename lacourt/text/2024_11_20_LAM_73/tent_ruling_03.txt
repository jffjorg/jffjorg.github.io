TENTATIVE RULING
 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses
to Form Interrogatories (Set One). Defendant shall provide verified responses within 30 days.

sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $1,200 in attorney’s fees. Said
monetary sanctions are to be paid to counsel for Plaintiff within 30 days of
the date of this order. 
BACKGROUND
 
On September
15, 2023, Plaintiff Cuft LLC filed this action against Defendant The Elite
Fashion Group, Inc.
 
On December
7, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint alleging causes of action
for (1) breach of contract, (2) negligent misrepresentation, (3) intentional
misrepresentation, (4) fraudulent concealment, (5) violation of California’s
Unfair Competition Law, and (6) unjust enrichment. 
 
The FAC
alleges the following. Plaintiff, a fashion apparel company, contracted with
Defendant to manufacture women’s underwear using 100% hemp fabric, and provide
the fabric to Plaintiff to test the material. Defendant made false promises and
representations regarding the garments’ material and composition, stating it
would make the material available for independent testing, and deliver the
product within weeks to induce Plaintiff to pay Defendant tens of thousands of
dollars. Plaintiff justifiably relied and paid Defendant $90,000. Defendant
failed to manufacture the women’s undergarments according to Plaintiff’s
specifications or provide the fabric for testing, concealed that the samples
were defective, and failed to deliver the product at all or return the monies
paid.
On April 11,
2024, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Compel Further Responses to Plaintiff’s Form
Interrogatories (Set One) and Request for Monetary Sanctions, arguing:
·      
Plaintiff served her first set of Requests for Production on January 20,
2024.
·      
Defendant did not respond substantively to Plaintiff’s requests.
Defendant asserted boilerplate objections to all of Plaintiff’s discovery
requests. Defendant also refuses to answer any discovery because it claims
discovery was served before service of the complaint.
·      
However, Plaintiff argues the Complaint and summons was personally
served on Defendant on September 24, 2023, more than three months before
Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories were served on Defendant, through its counsel.
·      
Plaintiff asserts that Defendant’s objections lack merit and
sanctions in the amount of $1,200 are warranted.
Defendant
did not file an opposition to Plaintiff’s motion. Plaintiff did not file a
reply.
ANALYSIS
 
A.      Legal
Standard 
 
“Unless
otherwise limited by order of the court in accordance with this title, any
party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is
relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action or to the
determination of any motion made in that action, if the matter either is itself
admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence.” (Code of Civ. Proc. § 2017.010.) 
 
A motion to
compel further responses to interrogatories may be brought based on: (1)
incomplete statements of compliance; (2) inadequate, evasive or incomplete
claims of inability to comply; or (3) unmerited or overly generalized
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.300(c).) 
 
It is not
necessary for the motion to show that the material sought will be admissible in
evidence. “Good cause” may be found to justify discovery where specific facts
show that the discovery is necessary for effective trial preparation or to
prevent surprise at trial. (See Associated Brewers Dist. Co. v. Superior Court
(1967) 65 Cal.2d 583, 586-588; see also Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2017.010,
2019.030(a)(1) (Information is discoverable if it is itself admissible in
evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence and it is not unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or is
obtainable from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or
less expensive.); Lipton v. Superior Court (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1599,
1611-1612 (noting a party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not
privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending
action, if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence).) 
  
If a timely
motion to compel has been filed, the burden is on the responding party to
justify any objection or failure fully to answer. (Coy v. Superior Court
(1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220–221 [addressing a motion to compel further responses
to interrogatories]; see also Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2000)
22 Cal.4th 245, 255.) 
 
B.      Meet and
Confer
 
A motion to
compel further discovery responses must be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration stating “facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an
informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (Code Civ. Proc. §§
2033.290, subd. (b)(1); 2031.310, subd. (b)(2); 2016.040.)¿ 
 
Here,
Plaintiff’s counsel declares that on March 25, 2024, the parties scheduled a
meet and confer call and on March 29, 2024, counsel for both parties met and
conferred by phone regarding Defendant’s objections to Plaintiff’s discovery. (Tabibkhoei
Decl. ¶ 7.) Therefore, the Court finds that counsel has satisfied the
preliminary meet and confer requirement under Code of Civil Procedure sections
2030.300, subdivision (b)(1) and 2031.310, subdivision (b)(2). 
 
C.      Discussion
 
Plaintiff represents
that Plaintiff
served standard form interrogatories, which directly targeted information
regarding (1) Defendant and (2) witnesses, documents, and the factual bases of
Defendant’s contentions, denials and defenses. (Motion,
pp. 2-3.) 
 
Defendant
objected to each of the subject RFPs on the bases that: “(1) the service is invalid because the discovery was served
before service of the complaint; (2) service was not appropriate because
Defendant’s counsel had not formally “appeared”; (3) the form interrogatories
are not tailored to seek relevant information; (4) burdensome and overly broad;
(5) vague and ambiguous; and (6) seek privileged information.” (Motion, p. 3.)
 
The burden
rests with the objecting party to justify the objection. (Coy v. Superior
Court of Contra Costa County (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220–221.) Here, as
Defendant has failed to oppose the instant motion, the Court finds that it has
failed to meet its burden to justify its objections to Plaintiff’s discovery
requests. 
 
Moreover, Plaintiff attaches a
copy of the Proof of Service of the Summons and Complaint which indicates it
was personally
served on Defendant on September 24, 2023. (Tabibkhoei
Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. 1.)
 
A plaintiff may serve discovery on another party “10
days after service of the summons on, or appearance by, that party, whichever
occurs first.” (C.C.P. §§ 2031.020(b), 2030.020(b).)
 
Plaintiff served
her first set of Form Interrogatories on January 20, 2024. Therefore, the Court
does not find Plaintiff failed to comply with CCP §
2031.020(b) since Plaintiff served its discovery more than 10 days after
service of the summons. 
 
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to
compel responses to Form Interrogatories (Set One).
 
D.    
Request for Monetary Sanctions
Plaintiff requests $1,200 in attorney’s fees as
monetary sanctions against Defendant. Plaintiff’s counsel’s hourly rate is $400
per hour and counsel seeks to recover three hours for preparing this motion. (Tabibkhoei
Decl., ¶¶ 8-9.)
The Court finds Plaintiff’s counsel’s hourly rate and
number of hours counsel seeks to recover is reasonable. 
The Court therefore GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for
monetary sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $1,200 in attorney’s
fees. The Court orders Defendant to pay $1,200 to Plaintiff, through its
counsel of record, within 30 days of the date of this ruling.
CONCLUSION 

 
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to Form
Interrogatories (Set One). Defendant shall provide verified
responses within 30 days. 
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions against Defendant in
the amount of $1,200 in attorney’s fees. Said
monetary sanctions are to be paid to counsel for Plaintiff within 30 days of
the date of this order.
