 Case Number:  23PSCV03267    Hearing Date:   May 13, 2024    Dept:  6 Plaintiff
Bankers Healthcare Group, LLC’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment 
Defendant: Jessi P Changala 
COURT RULING           
Plaintiff’s request for entry of
default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.           
BACKGROUND           
This is
a collection case. On October 23, 2023, plaintiff Bankers Healthcare Group, LLC
(Plaintiff) filed this action against defendant Jessi P Changala (Defendant)
and Does 1 through 10, alleging one cause of action for breach of contract. On April
15, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for entry of default and a default judgment
package.           
LEGAL
STANDARD
Code of
Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party
has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party
seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court
Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other
admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest
computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a declaration
of military status; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all
parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate
judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for
attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.)  
ANALYSIS
Plaintiff
seeks default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $37,404.36,
including $35,750.63 in damages, $0.00 in interest, $1,072.51 in attorney fees,
and $581.22 in costs. While this request for entry of default judgment
addresses most of the issues in the Court’s March 14, 2024 order denying
Plaintiff’s prior request for entry of default judgment, it utilizes the same
problematic declaration from Daniel Johnston. (Order Re: Tentative Ruling (3/14/24).)
The declaration of Daniel Johnston was executed on June 7, 2023, i.e., before
this lawsuit was filed, and indicates that demand for payment of the balance
owed was made more than 30 days before making the declaration. (Johnston Decl.,
¶ 8.) However, the demand letter is also dated June 7, 2023. (Salim Decl.,
(3/8/24), Ex. A.) While default generally admits the material allegations of
the complaint, (Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357,
361-362), it does not obligate the Court to ignore conflicting evidence, (see Fasuyi
v. Permatex, Inc. (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 681, 693 [addressing conflict in
evidence regarding service of statement of damages in connection with default
judgment]). Plaintiff needs to submit a new declaration to resolve this
conflict in the evidence, preferably one that was not executed before the
lawsuit was filed. 
The Court further notes that the underlying
loan agreement lists Pinnacle Bank as the lender, not Plaintiff. (Compl., Ex.
A.) Plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence showing that Plaintiff is
the successor in interest to Pinnacle Bank, its authorized representative, or
that Pinnacle Bank is a fictitious business name of Plaintiff. At most, Mr.
Johnston declares that, “Defendant signed a Promissory Note/Loan Agreement
payable to the above named Plaintiff, or a predecessor in interest…” (Johnston
Decl., ¶ 4.) Plaintiff needs to provide evidence clarifying this discrepancy. Additionally,
if Plaintiff purchased this debt from Pinnacle Bank or some other predecessor
in interest, Plaintiff will need to submit the request for entry of default
judgment on Judicial Council form CIV-105 to comply with the Fair Debt Buying
Practices Act. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800, subd. (a).) 
CONCLUSION           
            Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s request
for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
