```

And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

Based on the evidence presented, the court denies the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment without prejudice. The court notes that the plaintiff's declaration contains conflicting evidence regarding the demand for payment and the discrepancy in the loan agreement. Additionally, the court finds that the plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence to establish that it is the successor in interest to Pinnacle Bank or its authorized representative. The court requires the plaintiff to provide new evidence to resolve these issues.
