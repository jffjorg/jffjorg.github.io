LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
California Code of Civil Procedure section¿877.6,
subdivision¿(a)(1),¿provides, in relevant part, that, on noticed motion,
“[a]ny¿party to an action wherein it is alleged that two or more parties are
joint¿tortfeasors¿or co-obligors on a contract debt shall be entitled to a
hearing on the issue of the good faith of a settlement entered into by the
plaintiff¿. . . and one or more alleged¿tortfeasors¿or co-obligors¿. . . .”¿¿“A
determination by the court that the settlement was made in good faith shall bar
any other joint¿tortfeasor¿or co-obligor from any further claims against the
settling¿tortfeasor¿or co-obligor for equitable comparative contribution, or
partial or comparative indemnity, based on comparative negligence or
comparative fault.”¿¿(Code Civ. Proc.,¿§ 877.6, subd.¿(c).)¿¿Although a
determination that a settlement was in good faith does not discharge any other
party from liability, “it shall reduce the claims against the others in the
amount stipulated” by the settlement.¿¿(Code Civ. Proc.,¿§ 877, subd.¿(a).)¿ 
 
“The party asserting the lack of good faith shall have the
burden of proof on that issue.”¿¿(Code Civ. Proc.,¿§ 877.6, subd.¿(d).)¿ 
 
In¿City of Grand View
Terrace v. Superior Court¿(1987)¿192 Cal.App.3d 1251, 1261, the court
provided the following guidance regarding a motion for a good faith settlement
determination:¿ 
 
This court
notes that of the hundreds of motions for good faith determination presented
for trial court approval each year, the overwhelming majority are unopposed and
granted summarily by the trial court.¿ At the time of filing in many cases, the
moving party does not know if a contest will develop.¿ If each motion required
a full recital by declaration or affidavit setting forth a complete factual
response to all of the¿Tech-Bilt¿factors,
literally thousands of attorney hours would be consumed and inch-thick motions
would have to be read and considered by¿trial courts in an exercise which would
waste valuable judicial and legal time and clients’ resources. . .. That is to
say, when no one objects, the barebones motion which sets forth the ground of
good faith, accompanied by a declaration which sets forth a brief background of
the case is sufficient.¿ 
If the good
faith settlement is contested, section 877.6, subdivision (d), sets forth a
workable ground rule for the hearing by placing the burden of proving the lack
of good faith on the contesting party.¿¿Once there is a showing made by the
settlor of the settlement, the burden of proof on the issue of good faith
shifts to the¿nonsettlor¿who asserts that the settlement was not made in good
faith.¿¿If contested, declarations by the¿nonsettlor¿should be filed which in
many cases could require the moving party to file
responsive¿counterdeclarations¿to negate the lack of good faith asserted by
the¿nonsettling¿contesting party.¿ 
(192 Cal.App.3d 1251, 1260-1261¿[citation omitted].)¿ 
 
In¿Tech-Bilt, Inc. v.
Woodward-Clyde & Associates¿(1985) 38 Cal.3d 488, 499, the California
Supreme Court identified the following nonexclusive factors courts are to
consider in determining if a settlement is in good faith under section 877.6:
“a rough approximation of plaintiffs’¿total recovery and the settlor's
proportionate liability, the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of
settlement proceeds among plaintiffs, and a recognition that a settlor should
pay less in settlement than he would if he were found liable after a
trial.¿¿Other relevant considerations include the financial conditions and
insurance policy limits of settling defendants,¿as well as the existence of
collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure the interests of¿nonsettling¿defendants.”¿ Not every factor will apply in each case. (Dole Food Co., Inc. v. Sup. Ct. (Shell
Oil Co.) (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 894, 909.) 
 
The evaluation of whether a settlement was made in good
faith is required to “be made¿on the basis of¿information available at the time
of settlement.”¿¿(Tech-Bilt, Inc.,¿supra,¿38¿Cal.3d at¿p.¿499.)¿¿“‘[A] defendant’s settlement figure must
not be grossly disproportionate to what a reasonable person, at the time of the
settlement, would estimate the settling defendant’s liability to be.’
[Citation.]”¿¿(Ibid.)¿ 
 
“The party asserting the lack of good faith, who has the
burden of proof on that issue (§ 877.6,¿subd. (d)), should be permitted to
demonstrate, if he can, that the settlement is so far¿‘out of the ballpark’¿in
relation to these factors as to be inconsistent with the equitable objectives
of¿the statute.¿¿Such a demonstration would establish that the proposed
settlement was not a¿‘settlement made in good faith’¿within the terms of
section 877.6.”¿¿(Id.¿at pp.
499-500.)¿ 
 
“[A] court not only looks at the alleged tortfeasor's
potential liability to the plaintiff, but¿it must also consider the culpability
of the tortfeasor vis-à-vis other parties alleged to be responsible for the
same injury.¿ Potential liability for indemnity to a nonsettling defendant is
an important consideration for the trial court in determining whether to
approve a settlement by an alleged tortfeasor.¿ [Citation.]”¿ (TSI Seismic Tenant Space, Inc. v. Superior
Court¿(2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 159, 166.)¿ 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Defendant Yunhee contends the settlement with LADWP is in
good faith because it satisfies the Tech-Bilt
factors and, importantly, is relative to their proportionate share of the
Property. Defendant Brandon Min argues LADWP had previously claimed Yunhee’s
cross-complaint was baseless but now offers to settle. Defendant Brandon Min
does not oppose the settlement of LADWP’s Complaint.[2]
 
“The party asserting the lack of good faith shall have the
burden of proof on that issue.”¿¿(Code Civ. Proc.,¿§ 877.6,¿subd.¿(d).)¿Here,
Defendant Brandon Min is the only party opposing this settlement. He therefore
bears the burden to prove that the good faith settlement should be denied.  
  
To determine
whether settlement has been in good faith, courts look at certain factors. In¿Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde &
Associates¿(1985) 38 Cal.3d 488, 499, the California Supreme Court
identified the following nonexclusive factors courts are to consider in
determining if a settlement is in good faith under section 877.6: “a rough
approximation of plaintiffs’¿total recovery and the settlor's proportionate
liability, the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of settlement proceeds
among plaintiffs, and a recognition that a settlor should pay less in
settlement than he would if he were found liable after a trial.¿¿Other relevant
considerations include the financial conditions and insurance policy limits of
settling defendants,¿as well as the existence of collusion, fraud, or tortious
conduct aimed to injure the interests of¿nonsettling¿defendants.” 
 
Factor 1: Proportionate
Liability
 
Defendant Yunhee is settling the LADWP bill for her proportionate
share of the Property and LADWP has agreed to settle Yunhee’s
Cross-Complaint against it for $24,000. Defendant Brandon has not challenged the
settlement of LADWP’s Complaint, but contends, without evidence, that LADWP’s
settlement of Yunhee’s Cross-Complaint is somehow suspicious because it is
“generous.” The settlement is not suspicious because Defendant
Yunhee is settling for her proportionate share of liability.
 
Accordingly, this factor weighs in favor of finding good
faith.
 
Factor 2: Amount Paid in
Settlement
 
As above, Defendant Yunhee is settling with LADWP for her
proportionate share of the bill. Additionally, Defendant Yunhee has already
paid other outstanding bills from LADWP. (Correll Decl., Ex. 1, pg. 1.)
Defendant Brandon does not challenge this either.
 
Accordingly, this factor weighs in favor of finding good
faith.
 
Factor 3: Recognition
Settlor Should Pay Less in Settlement
 
Based on the facts of this case, this factor does not apply
because Defendant Yunhee is settling for her proportionate share of LADWP’s
bill.
 
Factor 4: Allocation of
Settlement Proceeds Among Plaintiffs.
 
This factor does not apply because there is only one
Plaintiff. 
 
Factor 5: Settlor’s
Financial Condition and Insurance Policy Limits
 
This
factor does not apply because Defendant Yunhee’s financial condition or
insurance coverage is not at issue here.
 
Factor 6: Evidence of
Collusion, Fraud, or Tortious Conduct Between Settlor and Plaintiffs Aimed at
Making the Nonsettling Parties Pay More than Their Fair Share
 
Here, there is no evidence of fraud or collusion. The
settlement was negotiated by counsel and conducted in good faith. (Correll Decl.
¶ 5.) Defendant Yunhee is paying her proportionate share and Defendant Brandon
has indicated that he has the same settlement with LADWP. As such, the
court is hard pressed to find Settling Defendants are somehow forcing the
nonsettling parties to pay more than their fair share.[3] 
 
Accordingly, the Tech-Bilt
factors have been satisfied.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      Motion
for Determination of Good Faith Settlement is GRANTED.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
