And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the motion for determination of good faith settlement filed by Defendant Yunhee Min. The judge has determined that the settlement between Defendant Yunhee Min and LADWP is in good faith, based on the Tech-Bilt factors, which include proportionate liability, amount paid in settlement, recognition that a settlor should pay less in settlement, allocation of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs, the financial conditions and insurance policy limits of settling defendants, and evidence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct between the settlor and plaintiffs aimed at making non-settling parties pay more than their fair share. The judge found that the settlement was reasonable and in good faith, as Defendant Yunhee Min is settling for her proportionate share of the bill and LADWP has agreed to settle with her for $24,000.
