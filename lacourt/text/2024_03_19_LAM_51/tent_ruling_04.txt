TAHO § 45.33(f) provides: “A civil proceeding . . . initiated under this
article alleging any violation of Section 45.33 (2) may be commenced only after
the tenant provides written notice to the landlord of the alleged violation,
and the landlord fails to remedy the repair or maintenance issue within a
reasonable period of time.” There are no allegations in the SAC that Plaintiff
complied with this provision. However, there are facts alleged supporting
violations of other sections.
