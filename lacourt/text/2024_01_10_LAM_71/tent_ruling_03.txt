SERGIO VILLANUEVA-ARRIVILLAGA. 


 Case No.:  22STCV08341 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  January 10, 2024



 
Plaintiff’s
unopposed motion to enforce the
settlement and enter judgment against Defendant Sergio Villanueva-Arrivillaga in
the amount of $34,871.77 is granted.  
 
          Plaintiff TD
Bank, N.A. (“TD Bank”) (“Plaintiff”) moves for entry of judgment against
Defendant Sergio Villanueva-Arrivillaga (“Villanueva-Arrivillaga”)
(“Defendant”) on the grounds that Defendant entered into a Stipulation for
Settlement with Plaintiff (“Settlement”) but has failed to comply with the
terms of the Settlement.  (Notice of
Motion, pg. 1; C.C.P. §664.6.)
 
          Background
          On March 8,
2022, Plaintiff filed its complaint against Defendant alleging a single cause
of action for breach of contract.  On May
11, 2023, the parties entered into a stipulated settlement agreement
(“Settlement Agreement”).  (Decl.
of Chen ¶2, Exh. A.) 
The Settlement Agreement states that in the event of default by
Defendant, Defendant agrees that the damages owed to Plaintiff are $27,381.05
damages, $5,715.99 interest, $1,912.86 attorneys’ fees, and $661.87 court
costs, for a total of $35,671.77, les any amounts paid.  (Decl. of Chen ¶2, Exh. A at ¶1.)  The Settlement Agreement calls for Defendant
to pay Plaintiff $27,381.05 with $200.00 due by May 20, 2023, and starting on
June 20, 2023, and every 20th of the month, Defendant would pay Plaintiff
$200.00 until the balance was paid in full. 
(Decl. of Chen ¶2, Exh. A at ¶2.) 
On May 16, 2023, this Court signed an order dismissing the entire action
without prejudice, with the court retaining jurisdiction for the purpose of
enforcing the terms of the Settlement Agreement.  Defendant became past due on the September 20,
2023, payment. 
On November 15, 2023,
Plaintiff filed the instant motion.  As
of the date of this hearing, Defendant has not filed an opposition.
 
          Motion to Enforce Settlement
          C.C.P. §664.6 provides, as follows:
“If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties
outside the presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of
the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant
to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may
retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until
performance in full of the terms of the settlement.”
          Plaintiff submitted evidence Plaintiff
and Defendant entered into the Settlement Agreement, which was signed by
Plaintiff on May 11, 2023, and signed by Defendant on May 10, 2023.  (Decl. of Chen ¶2, Exh. A.)  Plaintiff submitted evidence that the payment
due on September 20, 2023, has not been received, and therefore Defendant is in
default of the requirement under the Settlement Agreement to make monthly
installments.  (Decl. of Chen ¶¶3-4, Exh.
B.)  Pursuant to the Settlement
Agreement, Plaintiff is entitled to recover $34,871.77 from Defendant.  (Decl. of Chen ¶¶2, 5, Exh. A at ¶1.)  The parties agreed the Settlement Agreement would
be enforceable in accordance with C.C.P. §664.6 and that the Court shall retain
jurisdiction to enforce it.  (Decl. of Chen ¶2, Exh. 1 at ¶10.)  Plaintiff
submitted evidence Defendant has failed to perform under the Settlement
Agreement.  (Decl. of Chen ¶3.)  Accordingly,
Plaintiff submitted evidence Defendant breached the Settlement Agreement, and
Plaintiff is entitled to an order enforcing the Settlement and entering
judgment against Defendant. 
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s unopposed motion
to enforce the Settlement Agreement against Defendant is granted in the amount
of $34,871.77.
 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s unopposed motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement and enter
judgment against Defendant in the amount of $34,871.77 is
granted.
Moving Party to give notice.
