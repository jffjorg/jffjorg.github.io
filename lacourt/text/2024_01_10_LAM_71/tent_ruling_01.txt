 Hearing
  Date:  January 10, 2023



 
Plaintiff Timothy Hennessy’s motion
to compel the deposition of Defendant Robert Assil is granted.  Defendant is ordered to appear for
deposition within 20 days and provide responses to Plaintiff’s request for

Plaintiff’s request for
monetary sanctions against Defendant is granted in the amount of $3,911.65,
payable within 20 days.
 
          Plaintiff Timothy Hennessy
(“Hennessy”) (“Plaintiff”) moves to compel
the deposition of Defendant Robert Assil (“Assil”) (“Defendant”) to appear for
deposition and produce documents. 
(Notice of Motion, pgs. 1-2; C.C.P §2025.480.)  Plaintiff also moves for an order awarding
monetary sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $3,911.65.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2.)
 
Meet and
Confer
C.C.P.
§2025.450(b)(2) requires that a motion to compel a party deponent to appear or
produce documents “shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under
Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and
produce the documents, electronically stored information, or things described
in the deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has
contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.”  (C.C.P. §2025.450(b)(2).)  The attempt to resolve informally may be made
either by conferring “in person, by telephone, or by letter with an opposing
party or attorney.”  (C.C.P.
§2023.010(i), [failure to make such attempt constitutes “misuse of discovery
process”].)
Plaintiff’s
counsel declares he noticed the November 10, 2023,
deposition of Defendant on October 24, 2023, following unsuccessful attempts to
obtain Defendant’s availability.  (Decl. of
Rosensweig ¶2.)  Plaintiff’s
counsel declares on October 27, 2023, Defendant’s counsel advised that the
noticed date was not agreeable and requested that Plaintiff provide alternative
dates, which Plaintiff’s counsel provided that day.  (Decl. of Rosensweig
¶3, Exh. A.)  Plaintiff’s counsel
declares on October 31, 2023, Defendant’s counsel requested
Plaintiff provide four additional available dates, which Plaintiff’s counsel
provided in reply, and followed up by requesting confirmation of a date on
November 14, 2023.  (Decl.
of Rosensweig ¶4, Exh. B.)  
Plaintiff’s
counsel declares that on
November 18, 2023, after having not received a response, Plaintiff served an
amended notice of deposition to occur on December 4, 2023, and requests for
production of documents.  (Decl.
of Rosensweig ¶5.)  Plaintiff’s counsel
declares that on November 30, 2023, having received no response or
objection from Defendant, Plaintiff requested confirmation of his intended
appearance, and in response, Defendant’s counsel contacted him by telephone to
advise that he and his client would not be appearing for his noticed deposition,
advised that he would make his client available for a deposition on an
alternative date, and requested that he take the deposition off-calendar based
upon their agreement.  (Decl.
of Rosensweig ¶6.)  
Plaintiff’s
counsel declares on December
1, 2023, counsel for Defendant advised that he and his client would appear for
a deposition on December 15, 2023.  (Decl.
of Rosensweig ¶6, Exh. C.)  Plaintiff’s
counsel declares he agreed to reschedule the deposition and served a
Second Amended Notice to take Defendant’s Deposition on December 2, 2023, to occur
on December 15, 2023, and Requests for Production of Documents.  (Decl. of Rosensweig ¶7,
Exh. D.)  
Plaintiff’s
counsel declares On December 14, 2023, Defendant’s counsel contacted Plaintiff’s
counsel by telephone to advise that he had purportedly scheduled an expert
deposition on the same date as Defendant’s deposition and that neither he nor
Defendant would be appearing for the deposition.  (Decl. of Rosensweig
¶9.)  Plaintiff’s counsel
declares Defendant’s counsel’s request that Plaintiff cancel the pending deposition
and advisement that he and his client would be available for any date which
Plaintiff selected was not perceived to be a good faith effort to meet and
confer, but rather a further effort to delay the filing of this Motion by
causing Plaintiff to serve a new deposition notice and repeat the process over
again.  (Decl. of Rosensweig ¶9; Exh. E.)  Plaintiff’s
counsel’s meet and confer efforts are sufficient per the requirements to meet
and confer “in person, by telephone, or by letter with an opposing party or
attorney.”  (C.C.P. §2023.010(i).)
 
Discussion
Having
reviewed Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant to attend and produce documents
at deposition, the Court rules as follows.
          On October 24, 2023, Plaintiff noticed
the deposition of Defendant to occur on November 10, 2023, following
unsuccessful efforts to obtain his availability.  (Decl. of Rosensweig
¶2.)  On October 27, 2023,
Defendant advised that the noticed date was not agreeable and requested that
Plaintiff provided alternative dates.  (Decl.
of Rosensweig ¶3.)  No objection
to the deposition notice was served.  (Decl.
of Rosensweig ¶3.)  On October 27, 2023,
Plaintiff provided three separate alternative dates for Defendant’s deposition.
 (Decl. of Rosensweig ¶3.)  Having received no response, on October 31,
2023, Plaintiff followed up with Defendant about the proposed dates. (Decl. of Rosensweig
¶3, Exh. A.)
Plaintiff’s
counsel declares on October 31, 2023, Defendant’s counsel requested Plaintiff
provide four additional available dates, which Plaintiff’s counsel provided in
reply, and followed up by requesting confirmation of a date on November 14,
2023.  (Decl. of Rosensweig ¶4, Exh.
B.)  
Plaintiff’s
counsel declares that on November 18, 2023, after having not received a
response, Plaintiff served an amended notice of deposition to occur on December
4, 2023, and requests for production of documents.  (Decl. of Rosensweig ¶5.)  Plaintiff’s counsel declares that on November
30, 2023, having received no response or objection from Defendant, Plaintiff
requested confirmation of his intended appearance, and in response, Defendant’s
counsel contacted him by telephone to advise that he and his client would not
be appearing for his noticed deposition, advised that he would make his client
available for a deposition on an alternative date, and requested that he take the
deposition off-calendar based upon their agreement.  (Decl. of Rosensweig ¶6.)  
Plaintiff’s
counsel declares on December 1, 2023, counsel for Defendant advised that he and
his client would appear for a deposition on December 15, 2023.  (Decl. of Rosensweig ¶6, Exh. C.)  Plaintiff’s counsel declares he agreed to
reschedule the deposition and served a Second Amended Notice to take
Defendant’s Deposition on December 2, 2023, to occur on December 15, 2023, and
Requests for Production of Documents. 
(Decl. of Rosensweig ¶7, Exh. D.) 

Plaintiff’s
counsel declares On December 14, 2023, Defendant’s counsel contacted Plaintiff’s
counsel by telephone to advise that he had purportedly scheduled an expert
deposition on the same date as Defendant’s deposition and that neither he nor
Defendant would be appearing for the deposition.  (Decl. of Rosensweig ¶9.)  Plaintiff’s counsel declares Defendant’s
counsel’s request that Plaintiff cancel the pending deposition and advisement
that he and his client would be available for any date which Plaintiff selected
was not perceived to be a good faith effort to meet and confer, but rather a
further effort to delay the filing of this Motion by causing Plaintiff to serve
a new deposition notice and repeat the process over again.  (Decl. of Rosensweig ¶9; Exh. E.)  
          Plaintiff filed and personally served the
instant motion on December 15, 2023.  Defendant’s
argument that the notice of the motion was insufficient has no merit, therefore.
 On the other hand, Defendant’s opposition
was filed on December 28, 2023, less than 9 court days before the hearing.  Plaintiff filed his reply on January 3, 2024.
Plaintiff
has demonstrated good cause to compel the deposition of Defendant because Plaintiff
properly noticed the deposition of Defendant on three occasions; Defendant has,
to date, failed to object, appear, or produce responsive documents; and
Defendant is a named party to this action and is a critically important fact
witness with responsive information necessary to Plaintiff’s preparation for
trial, which is now quickly approaching in this matter.  (C.C.P. §2025.280, 2017.010; Ahern v.
Superior Court (1952) 112 Cal.App.2d 27, 30.)
          The Court grants Plaintiff’s motion
pursuant to C.C.P. §2025.450 and orders Defendant Assil to appear for
deposition and produce responsive documents in 20 days.  Plaintiff has demonstrated good cause to
order Defendant to testify on all categories of Plaintiff’s notice and respond
to all requests for production.
 
Sanctions
The court shall impose a monetary sanction against any
party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel an answer or production, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of sanctions unjust. (C.C.P. §2025.450(g)(1).)
Plaintiff’s counsel
declares he spent 4.5 hours drafting the instant motion at a rate of $550.00
per hour and anticipates spending an additional 1.5 hours reviewing Defendant’s
opposition and drafting a reply, and an additional 1.0 hour preparing for and
attending the hearing on this matter.  (Decl.
of Rosensweig ¶13.) 
Plaintiff’s counsel also declares his office incurred the cost of $61.65
for filing the instant motion.  (Decl. of
Rosensweig ¶13.)  The Court calculates
Plaintiff’s counsel’s fees incurred on the instant motion as follows:
($550.00/hour x 7 hours) +
$61.65 = $3,911.65
Sanctions are payable by
Defendant within 20 days.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s motion to
compel the deposition of Defendant Assil is granted.  Defendant is ordered to appear for deposition
and produce responses to the request for production without objections within
20 days.
Plaintiff’s request for
monetary sanctions against Defendant is granted in the amount of $3,911.65.
Moving Party to give
notice of this ruling.
