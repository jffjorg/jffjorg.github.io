And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case, which is scheduled for a hearing on June 6, 2024. The plaintiff has moved to compel the defendant's responses to discovery requests, including form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents. The defendant opposed the motion, and the plaintiff replied. The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion as moot, as the defendant has now provided verified responses. The judge has also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions against the defendant, as there appears to be an issue regarding the service of the discovery requests.
