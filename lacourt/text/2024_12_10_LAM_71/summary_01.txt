Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions filed by Defendant Jones Lang Lasalle Americas, Inc. (JLL). The motions are for a determination that the settlement between JLL and Plaintiff Schubert Palmer was made in good faith and for an order sealing the Declaration of Jerri Johnson, which contains the confidential settlement amount.

The judge grants JLL's motion for a determination that the settlement was made in good faith, finding that the settlement was within the "reasonable range" of JLL's potential liability and that there is no evidence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed at making the non-settling parties pay more than their fair share.

However, the judge denies JLL's motion to seal the Declaration of Jerri Johnson, finding that JLL has not established an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record. The judge also finds that JLL has not demonstrated a substantial probability that its interests will be prejudiced absent sealing the settlement amount, and that JLL failed to submit proposed redactions for the Court to review.
