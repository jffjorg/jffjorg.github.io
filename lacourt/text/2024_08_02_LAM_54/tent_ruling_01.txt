BACKGROUND
 
            On June 20, 2022, Plaintiffs D.B.S.
Diamonds, Inc. (“DBS”) and The Luxury Exchange, LLC (“Exchange”) sued Lisa
Babaian, Avakian Geneve (“AG”), and Federal Insurance Company (“FIC”) (erroneously
sued as Chubb Group Holdings, Inc.) for (1) declaratory relief, (2) equitable
indemnity, (3) contribution, (4) breach of contract, (5) breach of implied
contract, (6) fraud, and (7) negligent misrepresentation.  Plaintiffs allege that on March 10, 2022
Exchange entered into an oral agreement to purchase a 11.12 carat diamond (“Diamond”) from Babaian for $170,000. Babaian
represented that she was the owner of the Diamond. Babaian had previously
purchased a ring with the Diamond from AG. 
DBS purchased an ownership interest in the Diamond.  Later that month, DBS submitted the Diamond
to the Gemological Institute of America, Inc. (“GIA”) for analysis and learned
that the Diamond had been reported stolen by FIC, which claimed to be its
rightful owner.  Plaintiffs seek a
declaration of the rights and obligations of the parties as well as damages.
 
            On August 29, 2022, Defendant FIC filed
a Cross-Complaint for declaratory relief against DBS, Exchange, Babaian, and
AG.

owner of the Diamond.”

ANALYSIS
 
A party seeking summary judgment has the
burden of producing evidentiary facts sufficient to entitle them to judgment as
a matter of law.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
437c, subd. (c).)  The moving party must
make an affirmative showing that they are entitled to judgment irrespective of
whether the opposing party files an opposition. 
(Villa v. McFerren (1995) 35
Cal.App.4th 733, 742-743.)  Thus, “the
initial burden is always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that
there are no triable issues of material fact.” 
(Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519 (citing Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850.)
 
The opposing party on a motion for
summary judgment is under no evidentiary burden to produce rebuttal evidence
until the moving party meets his or her initial movant’s burden.  (Binder
v. Aetna Life Insurance Company (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 832, 840.)  Once the initial movant’s burden is met, the
burden shifts to the opposing party to show, with admissible evidence, that
there is a triable issue requiring the weighing procedures of trial.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p).)  
 
The only cause of action asserted against FIC in the
Complaint is for declaratory relief.  Plaintiffs
move for summary judgement as to the Complaint against FIC on the ground that
there are no triable issues of material fact and Plaintiffs are entitled to
declaratory relief.  Alternatively,
Plaintiffs move for summary adjudication of this cause of action.
 
Similarly, the only cause of action asserted in the
Cross-Complaint is for declaratory relief. 
Plaintiffs move for summary judgement as to the Cross-Complaint on the
ground that there are no triable issues of material fact and Plaintiffs are
entitled to declaratory relief. 
Alternatively, Plaintiffs move for summary adjudication of this cause of
action.  
Plaintiffs argue that FIC’s claim that it owns the Diamond
has no merit as Plaintiffs are the bona fide purchasers of the Diamond and did
not have any notice of competing ownership. 
 
An
action for declaratory relief under Code of Civil Procedure § 1060 requires:
“(1) a proper subject of declaratory relief and (2) an actual controversy
involving justiciable questions relating to the rights or obligations of a
party. [Citation.]”  (Lee v. Silveira
(2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 527, 546; Brownfield v. Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital
(1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 405, 410.)  The
requirement that an “actual controversy” exists “concerns the existence of
present controversy relating to the legal rights and duties of the respective
parties pursuant to contract (Code Civ. Proc. § 1060), statute, or order,”
instead of a controversy that is “conjectural, anticipated to occur in the
future, or an attempt to obtain an advisory opinion from the court.”  (Brownfield, 208 Cal.App.3d at
410.)  “One test of the right to
institute proceedings for declaratory judgment is the necessity of present
adjudication as a guide for plaintiff's future conduct in order to preserve his
legal rights.”  (Osseous Technologies
of America, Inc. v. DiscoveryOrtho Partners, LLC (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th
357, 364-365.)  In Osseous, the
Court notes that “when there is accrued cause of action for an actual breach of
contract or other wrongful act,” the court may exercise its discretion under
Code of Civil Procedure § 1061 to deny declaratory relief.”  (Osseous, 191 Cal.App.4th at
366.)  Code of Civil Procedure § 1061
states that “[t]he court may refuse to exercise the power granted by this
chapter in any case where its declaration or determination is not necessary or
proper at the time under all the circumstances.”  The Court in Osseous found that the
demurrer was properly sustained because there were “no allegations of an
ongoing contractual relationship” between the parties and “[t]he future impact
of any declaratory relief on the parties’ behavior is speculative.”  (Osseous, 191 Cal.App.4th at 376-77.)
            The
parties’ rights as to the Diamond are a proper subject of declaratory relief
and an actual controversy regarding the ownership rights of the parties exists.
“Conversion is generally
described as the wrongful exercise of dominion over the personal property of
another.  [Citation.]”  (Fremont Indemnity Co. v. Fremont General
Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119.) 
“‘An innocent buyer from one without title or right to sell is
ordinarily liable for conversion.’ 5 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (10th ed. 2005
Torts, § 716, p. 1039.’”  (Regent
Alliance Ltd. v. Rabizadeh (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 1177, 1182.)  Acquiring possession of converted goods with
the intent to gain ownership through sale, pledge, gift, or otherwise is also
considered conversion, even if the recipient of the property is acted
innocently and in reasonable ignorance regarding the owner’s interest.  (Regent, 231 Cal.App.4th at 1182.)
 
California law recognizes exceptions to this general rule of
strict liability.  (Regent, 231
Cal.App.4th at 1183.)  One such exception
is that of the bona fide purchaser–“[i]f the party who committed the fraud then
sells the goods to ‘a bona fide purchaser’ who ‘takes for value and without
notice of the fraud, then such purchaser gets good title to the chattel and may
not be held for conversion (though the original converter may be).’”  (Regent, 231 Cal.App.4th at 1183.)
 
“A buyer is a bona fide
purchaser if it bought property in good faith, for value, and had no knowledge
or notice of the asserted rights of another.”  (612 South LLC v. Laconic Limited
Partnership (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1270, 1278; Melendrez v. D & I
Investment, Inc. (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 1238, 1251.)  “The first element does not require that the
buyer's consideration be the fair market value of the property (or anything
approaching it).  (Citation.)  Instead, the buyer need only part with
something of value in exchange for the property.  (Citation.)”  (Melendrez, supra, 127
Cal.App.4th at p. 1251.)
 
“The general rule places the burden of
proof upon a person claiming bona fide purchaser
status to present evidence that he or she acquired interest in the property
without notice of the prior interest.  [Citations.]”  (First Fidelity Thrift & Loan Assn. v.
Alliance Bank (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1433, 1442.)  “A person generally has
‘notice’ of a particular fact if that person has knowledge of circumstances
which, upon reasonable inquiry, would lead to that particular fact.
[Citations.]”  (First Fidelity, 60
Cal.App.4th at 1443.)  “The
determination whether a party is a good faith purchaser or encumbrancer for
value ordinarily is a question of fact; on appeal, that determination will not
be reversed unless it is unsupported by substantial evidence.”  (Triple A Management Co., Inc. v. Frisone
(1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 520, 536.)
Plaintiffs
present the declaration of Shay Belhassen, the owner and Chief Executive
Officer of DBS and owner, manager, and Chief Executive Officer of the Exchange.
He has been in the jewelry and diamond business since approximately January
2000 in the downtown Los Angeles Jewelry District.  (Belhassen Decl. ¶¶ 2-4.)  As part of his business, Belhassen buys
jewelry and diamonds from other merchants and individuals and sells it for
profit.  (Ibid. at ¶ 5.)  Around March 2022, he was introduced to
Babaian by a Beverly Hills broker/jeweler, Sahar Shayegh, owner of Iconic
Jewels, Inc., who made a diamond ring for Babaian with an 11.12 carat center
while working for the international jeweler AG in 2010.  (Ibid. at ¶¶ 6-7, Ex. 1; Shayegh
Decl. ¶¶ 2-5, Ex. 1.)  Belhassen met with
Babaian, examined the Diamond, and agreed to purchase only the Diamond for
$170,000.  (Belhassen Decl. ¶ 8.)  Around March 10, 2022, Babian presented her
driver’s license at the time of sale and signed a bill of sale to the Exchange,
and Belhassen transferred $170,000 to her from the Exchange’s bank account.  (Ibid. at Decl. ¶ 9, Ex. 2.)  DBS purchased an interest in the Diamond from
the Exchange.  (Ibid. at ¶ 9, Ex.
2.)  Belhassen states that he believed
the purchase price was a “fair and reasonable wholesale price,” that Babian had
the right to sell the diamond, and he had no notice of any claim to the diamond
from anyone else.  (Ibid. at ¶
10.)  With the intention to sell the
diamond, Belhassen submitted it to the Gemological Institute of America, Inc.
(“GIA”) to obtain a certificate confirming the description of the diamond.  (Ibid. at ¶ 11.)  He was informed by GIA that there was an
issue regarding ownership of the Diamond as FIC claimed it was the owner; this
was the first time Belhassen received notice of any other claim to the Diamond.  (Ibid. at ¶ 11.)  Based on this evidence, Plaintiffs argue that
they are the bona fide purchasers of the diamond without any notice to
competing ownership.
Plaintiffs have presented sufficient evidence to
meet their initial burden of demonstrating they are bona fide purchasers of the
Diamond.
 
In opposition, FIC submits the declaration of Golnaz
Heidari, attorney of record for FIC.  As
discussed above, the Court sustains Plaintiffs’ objections to the declaration
and only considers admissible evidence. 
 
Around June 26, 2009, FIC issued Donald Grant, Gigi
Grant, and the Grant Family Trust dated 8/8/90 ATIMA, an insurance policy that
covered an 11.12 carat diamond.  (Heidari
Decl. ¶ 2.)  Around June 20, 2022, FIC
received a complaint filed by Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants for Declaratory Relief.  (Ibid. at ¶ 12.)  FIC has presented a Deposition Subpoena for
Production of Business Records issued to the Custodian of Records at Beverly
Hills Police Department and in response, the declaration of Maritza Guerra,
Records Specialist for Sylvia Gelfman, Custodian of Records for the Beverly
Hills Police Department, with a police report prepared for Case Number 09-7893
regarding a missing diamond ring. 
(Heidari Decl., Exs. A-B.)  
 
The general rule in California is that an
innocent buyer is liable for conversion when acquiring property from one
without the right to sell the subject property, unless the bona fide purchaser
exception applies.  The burden is on Plaintiffs
to show that the bona fide purchaser exception applies to them.  Plaintiffs have presented the declarations of
Belhassen and Shayegh showing that they purchased the Diamond in good faith, for
$170,000, without any knowledge or notice of any other claims to the
Diamond.  As noted, Plaintiffs have met
their initial burden.  In response, Defendant
has presented a police report which demonstrates that the diamond ring at issue
went missing years prior to the transaction.
 
There is a triable issue of material
fact as to whether the Diamond was acquired through theft or fraudulent
representation; this must be resolved to decide whether the bona fide purchaser
exception applies.  There also is a
triable issue of material fact as to whether Plaintiffs conducted a reasonable
inquiry prior to the purchase of the Diamond, particularly since they learned
of the competing claim through GIA soon after the purchase.  The Court cannot find as a matter of law that
Plaintiffs were bona fide purchasers of the Diamond.
