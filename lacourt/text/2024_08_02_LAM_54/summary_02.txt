This is a tentative ruling on a motion to compel the deposition of Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc's Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK) and a request for sanctions. The Plaintiff, Daniel Meza, has been seeking to compel the deposition of the PMK since February 5, 2024, but the Defendant failed to respond to the deposition notice. The Plaintiff filed a motion to compel the deposition and requested sanctions of $3,390 for attorneys' fees. The Court grants the motion and orders the deposition to take place no later than August 8, 2024. The Court also orders the Defendant to pay $3,390 in sanctions to the Plaintiff within 30 days. The Court finds that the motion was necessary and that the Defendant's failure to respond to the deposition notice warrants the award of sanctions.
