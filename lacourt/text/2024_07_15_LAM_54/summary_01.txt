And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is about a motion to compel discovery and responses to written discovery, as well as a motion for judgment on the pleadings. The case involves a petition alleging violations of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) in connection with a development project at 464-466 Crane Boulevard in Los Angeles. The City of Los Angeles approved the project, and the Petitioner Crane Boulevard Safety Coalition filed a petition arguing that the City's decision-making process was unfair and that the City failed to provide a complete administrative record.

The Court ruled in part that the City must provide a copy of its Google Services contract and related documents, as well as certain emails and other documents that were withheld from the administrative record. The Court also ruled that the City's responses to written discovery were inadequate in certain respects.

The Court denied the motion to compel discovery as to certain requests for email and document production. The Court also granted the City's motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the third cause of action, which alleged that the City's decision-making process was untimely. The Court found that the petition failed to state facts sufficient to demonstrate that the City's decision-making process was untimely.

The Court granted the City's motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the fourth cause of action, which alleged that the City's decision-making process was unfair and that the City failed to provide a fair hearing. The Court found that the petition failed to allege any facts demonstrating that the Petitioner had a constitutionally protected due process claim against the City. The Court gave the Petitioner 20 days to amend its petition to cure the defects.
