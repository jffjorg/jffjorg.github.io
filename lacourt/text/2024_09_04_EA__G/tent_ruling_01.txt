Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Harvey Vechery’s Application for Default
Judgment is GRANTED in the reduced
amount of $1,382,195.65.
BACKGROUND
On October
19, 2023, Plaintiff Harvey Vechery filed a complaint against Defendant Greg J.
Halpern, alleging a cause of action for breach of contract based upon Halpern’s
alleged failure to repay a loan. On January 25, 2024, Vechery’s process server
served Halpern with substitute service in Spring Grove, Illinois.
On March
26, 2024, the court entered default against Halpern after Halpern failed to
file a timely answer. On May 8, 2024, Vechery submitted an application for
default judgment. On June 25, 2024, the court denied Vechery’s application and
vacated the entry of default against Halpern.
On July
9, 2024, the court entered default against Halpern after Vechery submitted an
updated proof of service. On August 8, 2024, Vechery submitted the present
application for default judgment.
An
OSC Re: Default Judgment is set for September 4, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
Vechery
seeks default judgment against Halpern in the total amount of $1,708,201.91,
including $1,365,104.86 in damages, $322,763.12 in interest, $18,784.18 in
attorney fees, and $1,549.75 in costs. Because the court finds Vechery has
submitted sufficient evidence, the court GRANTS Vechery’s application
for default judgment with the following modifications.
First,
while Vechery requests $18,784.18 in attorney fees, the court calculates
reasonable attorney fees to be $15,541.05 pursuant to Local Rule 3.214 ($2,890
+ $12,651.05 or 1% of $1,265,104.86).
Second,
while Vechery requests $322,763.12 in interest, the court cannot award such
interest as Vechery failed to request it in the Complaint. (See Flores v.
Smith (1941) 47 Cal.App.2d 253, 260-261.) Although interest may be awarded without
being pled in a contested case (Newby v. Vroman (1992) 11
Cal.App.4th 283, 286), the interests of due process require a default judgment
to be limited to the relief requested in the pleadings (Greenup v. Rodman (1986) 42 Cal.3d 822, 826).
Accordingly, the total judgment awarded is reduced to $1,382,195.65.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Vechery’s
application for default judgment is GRANTED in the reduced amount of
$1,382,195.65.
