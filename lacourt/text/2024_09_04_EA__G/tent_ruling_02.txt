ANALYSIS
Lane moves to strike Guzman
Salcedo’s fifth cause of action for intentional tort and sixth cause of action
for negligence pursuant to California’s anti-SLAPP statute. For the following
reasons, the court GRANTS Lane’s motion.
Legal Standard
California’s
anti-SLAPP statute “is designed to protect defendants from meritless lawsuits
that might chill the exercise of their rights to speak and petition on matters
of public concern. [Citations.] To that end, the statute authorizes a special
motion to strike claims ‘arising from any act of that person in furtherance of
the person’s right of petition or free speech under the United States
Constitution or the California Constitution in connection with a public issue.’”
(Wilson v. Cable News Network, Inc. (2019) 7 Cal.5th 871, 883-884,
quoting Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd. (b)(1).) “Anti-SLAPP motions are
evaluated through a two-step process. Initially, the moving defendant bears the
burden of establishing that the challenged allegations or claims ‘aris[e] from’
protected activity in which the defendant has engaged. [Citations.] If the
defendant carries its burden, the plaintiff must then demonstrate its claims
have at least ‘minimal merit.’” (Park v. Board of Trustees of California
State University (2017) 2 Cal.5th 1057, 1061.)
Discussion
Protected Activity
In
determining whether the claims at issue arise from protected activity, “courts
should consider the elements of the challenged claim and what actions by the
defendant supply those elements and consequently form the basis for liability.”
(Id., at p. 1063.) “The defendant's burden is to identify what acts each
challenged claim rests on and to show how those acts are protected under a
statutorily defined category of protected activity.” (Bonni v. St. Joseph
Health System (2021) 11 Cal.5th 995, 1009.) “A defendant meets this burden
by demonstrating that the act underlying the plaintiff’s cause fits one of the
categories spelled out in [Code of Civil Procedure] section 425.16, subdivision
(e).” (Braun v. Chronicle Publishing Co. (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1036,
1043.) “A defendant need only make a prima facie showing at this stage.” (Ojjeh
v. Brown (2019) 43 Cal.App.5th 1027, 1035.)
In
this case, Lane argues Guzman Salcedo’s causes of action arise from prelitigation
communications that are protected pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
425.16, subdivisions (e)(2). (Motion, p. 13:11-22.) Subdivision (e)(2) of Code
of Civil Procedure section 425.16 applies to “any written or oral statement or
writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a
legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any other official proceeding
authorized by law.” In interpreting this provision, courts have applied it to
prelitigation communications “if a statement ‘concern[s] the subject of the
dispute’ and is made ‘in anticipation of litigation contemplated in good faith
and under serious consideration.’” (Neville v. Chudacoff (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th
1255, 1268, quoting Rohde v. Wolf (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 28, 36.) “‘Good
faith’ in this context refers to a good faith intention to file a lawsuit
rather than a good faith belief in the truth of the communication.” (Digerati
Holdings, LLC v. Young Money Entertainment, LLC (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 873,
887 (Digerati).)
The
Complaint alleges negligence and an unspecified intentional tort against Lane
based on two sets of communications. (Complaint, p. 24-25.) First, on October
25, 2022, Guzman Salcedo called Lane who informed Guzman Salcedo that Lane
represented E*Trade Financial Corporation. (Complaint, p. 24.) Lane directed
Guzman Salcedo’s attention to a letter that Lane previously sent and provided a
copy orally after Guzman Salcedo denied receiving the letter. (Complaint, p.
24.) According to the Complaint, Lane’s letter told Guzman Salcedo to stop
harassing E*Trade employees and threatened legal action if Guzman Salcedo did
not stop. (Complaint, p. 24.) Second, on December 5, 2022, Guzman Salcedo
called Lane who informed Guzman Salcedo that “E*Trade retained him to threaten
the plaintiff with a restraining order.” (Complaint, p. 25.) Based on these
allegations, the court finds that Lane’s communications with Guzman Salcedo are
protected prelitigation communications as they concerned the subject of a
dispute which was Guzman Salcedo’s alleged harassment and were based on Lane’s
good faith intent to file a lawsuit or to seek a restraining order if Guzman
Salcedo did not cease the alleged harassment. (Lane Decl., ¶ 6.)
Thus,
Lane adequately established that Guzman Salcedo’s causes of action are based on
activity protected by California’s anti-SLAPP statute.
Probability of Prevailing
To
establish a probability of prevailing, “the plaintiff ‘must demonstrate that
the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima
facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence
submitted by the plaintiff is credited.’” (Wilson v. Parker, Covert &
Chidester (2002) 28 Cal.4th 811, 821, quoting Matson v. Dvorak (1995)
40 Cal.App.4th 539, 548.) Because California’s anti-SLAPP statute “(1) permits
early intervention in lawsuits alleging unmeritorious causes of action that
implicate free speech concerns, and (2) limits opportunity to conduct discovery, the plaintiff’s
burden of establishing a probability of prevailing is not high: We do not weigh
credibility, nor do we evaluate the weight of the evidence. Instead, we accept
as true all evidence favorable to the plaintiff and assess the defendant’s
evidence only to determine if it defeats the plaintiff’s submission as a matter
of law. [Citation.] Only a cause of action that lacks ‘even minimal merit’
constitutes a SLAPP.” (Overstock.com, Inc. v. Gradient Analytics, Inc.
(2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 688, 699-700.)
A
probability of prevailing “means a reasonable probability of prevailing, not
prevailing by a preponderance of the evidence. For this reason, a court must
apply a ‘summary-judgment-like’ test [Citation], accepting as true the evidence
favorable to the plaintiff and evaluating the defendant’s evidence only to
determine whether the defendant has defeated the plaintiff's evidence as a
matter of law.” (Gerbosi v. Gaims, Weil, West & Epstein, LLP (2011)
193 Cal.App.4th 435, 444.)
Here,
Defendant Lane argues Guzman Salcedo cannot establish a probability of
prevailing as Guzman Salcedo’s causes of action are barred as a matter of law
by the litigation privilege. (Motion, p. 16:18-18:18.) “A plaintiff cannot show
a probability of prevailing on the merits of a cause of action for anti-SLAPP
purposes where the cause of action is barred by the litigation privilege
codified in Civil Code section 47.” (Flickinger v. Finwall (2022) 85
Cal.App.5th 822, 840.) The litigation privilege “applies to any communication
(1) made in judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings; (2) by litigants or other
participants authorized by law; (3) to achieve the objects of the litigation;
and (4) that have some connection or logical relation to the action.” (Silberg
v. Anderson (1990) 50 Cal.3d 205, 212.) “A prelitigation communication is
privileged only if it ‘relates to litigation that is contemplated in good faith
and under serious consideration,’ as we have stated. The requirement of good
faith contemplation and serious consideration provides some assurance that the
communication has some ‘connection or logical relation’ to a contemplated
action and is made ‘to achieve the objects’ of the litigation. ‘Whether a
prelitigation communication relates to litigation that is contemplated in good
faith and under serious consideration is an issue of fact.’” (Digerati, supra,
194 Cal.App.4th 873, 889, quoting Action Apartment Assn., Inc. v. City of
Santa Monica (2007) 41 Cal.4th 1232, 1251.)
Here,
as noted above, Guzman Salcedo’s own allegations and Lane’s declaration
establish that Lane’s communications were related to litigation that was
contemplated in good faith and seriously considered when Guzman Salcedo allegedly
engaged in harassment. While Guzman Salcedo contests the allegation that Guzman
Salcedo engaged in harassment (Opp., e.p. 4), this contention is irrelevant as the
litigation privilege is an absolute privilege and applies even if the
communication was false. (Kashian v. Harriman (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 892,
913 [“The litigation privilege is absolute; it applies, if at all, regardless
whether the communication was made with malice or the intent to harm.”]; see
Rusheen v. Cohen (2006) 37 Cal.4th 1048, 1058 [noting litigation privilege “has
been applied specifically in the context of abuse of process claims alleging
the filing of false or perjurious testimony or declarations”].
Because
the litigation privilege applies and bars Guzman Salcedo’s causes of action
against Lane, the court finds that Guzman Salcedo does not have any probability
of prevailing.
Accordingly,
Lane’s motion is GRANTED.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Defendant
Lane’s special motion to strike is GRANTED.
