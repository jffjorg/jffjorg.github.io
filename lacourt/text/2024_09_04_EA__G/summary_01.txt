And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's application for default judgment against the defendant in the reduced amount of $1,382,195.65. The plaintiff, Harvey Vechery, had filed a complaint against the defendant, Greg J. Halpern, alleging a breach of contract based on the defendant's failure to repay a loan. The defendant failed to file a timely answer and was subsequently served with substitute service in Spring Grove, Illinois. The court entered default against the defendant, but later vacated it after the plaintiff's initial application for default judgment was denied. The plaintiff has since submitted an updated proof of service and the present application for default judgment. The judge has reduced the amount of the judgment from $1,708,201.91 to $1,382,195.65 due to the plaintiff's failure to request interest in the complaint.
