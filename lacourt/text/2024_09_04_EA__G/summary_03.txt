The court finds that the parties have failed to adequately meet and confer in person or by telephone as required by California Code of Civil Procedure section 435.5. As a result, the court orders the parties to meet and confer regarding the motions to strike and file a supplemental declaration describing such meet and confer efforts at least nine (9) court days before the next scheduled hearing on the present motion.
