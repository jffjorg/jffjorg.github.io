And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant Michael D. Lane's special motion to strike. The motion was filed in response to Plaintiff Jose Guzman Salcedo's causes of action, which alleged that Lane's communications with Guzman Salcedo were tortious. The judge found that Lane's communications were protected prelitigation communications, which are shielded from liability under California's anti-SLAPP statute. The judge also found that Guzman Salcedo's causes of action were barred by the litigation privilege, which applies to communications made in contemplation of litigation that is serious and in good faith. As a result, the judge granted Lane's motion and struck Guzman Salcedo's causes of action.
