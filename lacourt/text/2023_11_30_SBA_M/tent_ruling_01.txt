BACKGROUND
On October 31, 2022, plaintiff
Cassandra Woods filed a complaint against defendants Eddie J. Suber, Jr. and
Norma J. Suber as Trustees of the Eddie J. Suber, Jr. and Norma J. Suber
Revocable Trust, DTD 7-20-01; LB Property Management, Inc., a California
Corporation; De Miranda Management, Inc., a California Corporation; and DOES 1
through 20, inclusive for (1) statutory breach of warranty of habitability
(Civ. Code §§ 1941, 1941.1), (2) tortious breach of implied warranty of
habitability, (3) negligence, (4) breach of contract, (5) nuisance, (6) breach
of covenant of quiet enjoyment, (7) breach of the implied covenant of good faith
and fair dealing, (8) intentional infliction of emotional distress, (9)
violation of the Inglewood stabilization ordinance – harassment, and (10)
violation of Civil Code §1942.4.
Trial is set for November 27, 2024.
 
LEGAL AUTHORITY
Civil Code §3294(a) states in
pertinent part, “In an action for the breach of an obligation not arising from
contract, where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that the
defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice, the plaintiff, in
addition to the actual damages, may recover damages for the sake of example and
by way of punishing the defendant.”
Civil Code §3294(c)(1) defines
malice as “conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the
plaintiff or despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a
willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.”  “Oppression” is defined as “despicable
conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious
disregard of that person’s rights.” 
Civil Code §3294(c)(2).
Civil Code §3295(c) states that, “No
pretrial discovery by the plaintiff shall be permitted with respect to the
evidence referred to in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subdivision (a) unless the
court enters an order permitting such discovery pursuant to this subdivision. .
. . Upon motion by the plaintiff supported by appropriate affidavits and after
a hearing, if the court deems a hearing to be necessary, the court may at any
time enter an order permitting the discovery otherwise prohibited by this
subdivision if the court finds, on the basis of the supporting and opposing
affidavits presented, that the plaintiff has established that there is a
substantial probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim pursuant
to Section 3294.  Such order shall not be
considered to be a determination on the merits of the claim or any defense
thereto and shall not be given in evidence or referred to at the trial.”
“Before a court may enter an order
permitting discovery of a defendant’s financial condition, it must (1) weigh
the evidence submitted in favor of and in opposition to motion for discovery,
and (2) make a finding that it is very likely the plaintiff will prevail on his
claim for punitive damages. In this context, we interpret the words
‘substantial probability’ to mean ‘very likely’ or ‘a strong likelihood’ just
as their plain meaning suggests. We note that the Legislature did not use the
term ‘reasonable probability’ or simply ‘probability,’ which would imply a
lower threshold of ‘more likely than not.’” Jabro v. Superior Court
(2002) 95 Cal. App. 4th 754, 758.
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff
Cassandra Woods requests an order permitting plaintiff to take discovery
regarding the financial condition, including profits gained from the wrongful
conduct, of defendants Eddie
J. Suber, Jr. and Norma J. Suber as Trustees of the Eddie J. Suber, Jr. and
Norma J. Suber Revocable Trust, DTD 7-20-01, LB Property Management, Inc., and
De Miranda Management, Inc. 
            The verified complaint alleges that
plaintiff moved into the property at 135 North Hillcrest Blvd., #4, Inglewood, on
April 1, 2019, pursuant to a lease agreement. 
Complaint, ¶¶1, 20.  She pays a
rental amount of $1604.  Id., ¶21.  On September 25, 2019, she started to notice
water intrusion and mold present at the property.  Id., ¶22. 
She also identified other substandard issues present at the
property.  Id., ¶23.  Plaintiff provided actual notice to
defendants of the issues present at the property.  Id., ¶24. 
Plaintiff specifically provided notice to defendants on November 5,
2019.  Id., ¶25.  Plaintiff continuously notified defendants of
the same issues.  Id., ¶26.  Said issues have substantially interfered
with the quiet enjoyment and peace of mind of plaintiff at the property.  Id., ¶27. 
Defendants as owner or agents of the owner of the property are
responsible to repair substandard issues at the property.  Id., ¶29. 
Said issues are substantial defects affecting plaintiff’s health and
safety.  Id., ¶30.  Defendants having full notice and not
performing any adequate repairs, have a conscious disregard for the safety of
plaintiff.  Id., ¶31.  In spite of plaintiff’s pleas, the issues
continued to intensify over time.  Id., ¶34.  Plaintiff has reported said issues to the LA
County Health Department reporting multiple health code violations.  Id., ¶35. 
Defendants were notified by the LA County Health Department of the
multiple health code violations.  Id.,
¶36.
            Plaintiff argues that she has a
substantial probability that she will prevail on her punitive damages
claim.  She contends that she has more
than adequately pled facts showing that defendants acted with malice and oppression
in failing to remedy the severe water intrusion and other defects present
throughout the property despite knowledge of the issue.  She argues that pretrial discovery of
defendants’ financial condition is warranted to allow plaintiff to meet her
burden of proof and present such evidence at trial.  
            Plaintiff presents her declaration
stating that in October 2019, her kitchen sink clogged and overflowed, she
placed a call to the property manager, but the necessary repairs were not
completed that day.  The person assigned
to address the issue left a huge hole underneath her sink.  Cassandra Woods decl., ¶4.  On November 5, 2019, plaintiff sent follow-up
email to complete the work and a second email that the kitchen sink started to
overflow again.  Repairs were not
scheduled for that day.  Id., ¶5.  She states that from November 18, 2019 through
August 2022, she continuously provided notice to defendants of the failure to
repair any issues at the property.  Id., ¶7.  She attached “some of the several screen
shots of the written notifications” provided by plaintiff via the online
portal.  Id., ¶8.  On August 18, 2022, she filed a complaint with
the LA County Dept. of Public Health regarding the cockroach infestation, water
intrusion, mold, malfunctioning appliances, and peeling paint.  Id., ¶9, Exh. 3.  The County sent a Courtesy Notice to Abate,
compliance date of September 20, 2022.  Id.,
¶11.  She states that on September 15,
2022 through May 2023, she continuously had issues with the property and
provided continuous written notice of said issues.  Defendants failed to engage in repairs.  Id., ¶12. 
On September 20, 2022, she called the County and filed a second
complaint.  Id., ¶13.  On September 21, 2022, plaintiff submitted
another work order.  “I submitted no less
than 3 work orders to the Defendants, and none were responded too.”  Id., ¶14. 
On September 22, 2022, the County sent a 2nd Notice to Abate,
with compliance date of October 6, 2022. 
Id., ¶15.  On September 23, 2022,
she submitted another work order.  She
states that no one ever showed up.  Id., ¶16.  On October 5, 2022, she sent an email
requesting assistance with the infestation and mold.  On October 6, she submitted a work
order.  Id., ¶17.  On November 6, 2022, she submitted a work
order.  She states that she did not
receive a response and no repairs were scheduled.  Id., ¶18. 
On May 15, 2023, she had another sewage issue within the bathroom,
defendants were notified, and no response or repairs were made.  Id., ¶19. She attached photographs of the
property, but they are not dated. 
            In opposition, defendants argue that
plaintiff has not met her burden of showing there is a substantial probability
that she will prevail on a claim for punitive damages.  Defendants assert that the verified complaint
upon which plaintiff relies is conclusory and that she has failed to provide
evidence showing that defendants’ actions or inactions rose to the level of
oppression, malice, or fraud.  Defendants
assert that the parties are still in the process of conducting written
discovery and no depositions have been scheduled.  Defendants also contend that plaintiff has
not provided any evidence that defendants “actually refused to make repairs”
and that if defendants failed to timely or properly make repairs to plaintiff’s
unit, “this would be a simple case of negligence.”  Defendants further assert that the LADPH
inspector noted during their formal inspection that active repairs were being
completed within plaintiff’s unit. 
Defendants also contend that plaintiff has failed to limit or define the
scope of the discovery sought.
            In support of the opposition,
defendants provide the courtesy notice to abate, showing the notice date of
August 30, 2022 and the compliance date of September 20, 2022.  The Official Inspection Report showed the
inspection date of September 22, 2022 and the re-inspection date of October 6,
2022.  The “Overall Inspection Comments”
included “[t]he complaint alleging water leaking from the unit above was not
observed as there was a person on the site working on patching the ceiling in
the bathroom.”  The “following was
observed in unit #4:  (1) approximately a
4 foot section of wall in the closet has mold like substance.  (2) 20+ live adult cockroaches in the drawers
of the media cabinet in the living room and 4 nymphs in the cabinets under the
electric range in the kitchen.  (3)
Kitchen counter top has paint peeling around the sink exposing the tile
underneath.  (4) Electric oven is non
functional.”  
Defendants also present the work
orders submitted by plaintiff (including comments from the worker) and several
invoices for work done on plaintiff’s unit (which show work done before and
after the complaint was filed).  A May
13, 2021 work order states, “inspected and repaired damage walls in bedroom and
closet” and “in the bathroom the medicine cabinet had black spots. . . . I
sanded, primer and paint.”  A May 21,
2021 work order states, “inspect and repair damaged walls in bedroom and
closet, locate source of moisture and repair.” 
An August 24, 2021 work order states, “replace vanity sink, replace

hard so they don’t come back.”  An April 4,
2023 invoice states gel treatment to kitchen and bath for roach infestation. 
Defendants provided further

            In reply, plaintiff contends that
defendants failed to provide any affidavits to dispute plaintiff’s factual
statements or defend defendants’ position.   Plaintiff also objects to the documents
attached to defense counsel’s declaration as lacking authentication.  Plaintiff contends that the repair reports
were after plaintiff filed her complaint in October 2022.  She also argues that she has multiple causes
of action that entitle her to punitive damages.
            The
court rules as follows:  The court finds
that plaintiff has not
established that there is a “substantial probability” that she will prevail on her
punitive damages claim at this stage.  Defendants presented evidence of numerous responses
to the work orders submitted by plaintiff and invoices dating from 2021 to 2023
of maintenance and repair work done at plaintiff’s unit, including as to leaks,
roach infestation, and stove.  Such
effort and expense tend to show that defendants did not engage in despicable
conduct or intend to harm plaintiff.  As
to the instances in October and November 2019, the evidence indicates that
defendants did not respond that same day but that they did respond.  Whether the issue was not “addressed with any
urgency” does not show malice.  Plaintiff
does not indicate any issues in 2020 or proof of any complaints or work order
requests or of defendants’ failure to respond. 
As to the notice to abate, County inspection, and work order requests
occurring in September through November 2022, defendants showed numerous
invoices of either attempts to repair or repairs. 
The court also notes that although
the motion can be brought at any time, discovery is ongoing, and trial is not
set until November 2024.  At a later
date, plaintiff may request that defendants “stipulate to a process by which
[the defendant] would gather documents pertaining to [its] financial condition,
bring them to trial under seal and make them immediately available” in the
event that the jury's findings make punitive damages available.  See Jabro, supra, at 756.  This procedure “is a frequently used and
effective means of handling the matter when a claim for punitive damages is
alleged,” and may be suggested or facilitated by the court.  Id. 
Also, a plaintiff may do nothing pretrial and instead wait until
liability is established to ask the court for the order described in Civil Code
§3295(c).  Mike Davidov Co. v. Issod
(2000) 78 Cal. App. 4th 597, 609.
            Accordingly, the motion is DENIED
WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
            Defendants are ordered to give notice of ruling.
