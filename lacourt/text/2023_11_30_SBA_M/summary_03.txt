Summary:

The tentative ruling is regarding a demurrer and motion to strike filed by General Motors, LLC (GM) against Janie Vierya, the plaintiff. The demurrer is overruled as to the 5th cause of action for fraudulent concealment, and the motion to strike is denied. The court finds that the allegations are sufficient to support the elements of fraudulent concealment, and GM's defenses are insufficient to bar the claim. The ruling is based on the allegations that GM concealed the defective nature of the vehicle and its transmission, and that GM had a duty to disclose this information to the plaintiff. The court also finds that the specificity requirement for pleading fraudulent concealment is relaxed when the defendant possesses knowledge of the facts.
