MOTION
 
            Specially
appearing Defendant Alesia Sulock (“Sulock”) moves to quash service of the
summons and complaint on the basis of lack of personal jurisdiction.  Plaintiff Hunter Nation (“Plaintiff”) has not
filed an opposition to the motion.  
 
LEGAL
STANDARDS
 
“A defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time to plead or
within any further time that the court may for good cause allow, may serve and
file a notice of motion for one or more of the following purposes:  (1) To quash service of summons on the ground
of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10, subd.
(a)(1).)  
 
“[W]hen jurisdiction is challenged by a nonresident defendant, the
burden of proof is upon the plaintiff to demonstrate that ‘minimum contacts’
exist between the defendant and the forum state to justify imposition of
personal jurisdiction.” (Mihlon v. Superior Court (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d
703, 710.) It is thus upon the plaintiff to demonstrate by a preponderance of
the evidence that all jurisdictional criteria are met. (Ziller Electronics
Lab GmbH v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 1222, 1232.) If plaintiff
meets this burden, “it becomes the defendant’s burden to demonstrate that the
existence of jurisdiction would be unreasonable.” (Buchanan v. Soto
(2015) 241 Cal.App.4th 1353, 1362.)
 
California’s long-arm statute grants its courts the power to assert
personal jurisdiction over out-of-state parties to the maximum extent that the
state and federal constitutions allow. (Code Civ. Proc., § 410.10.) Under the
due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States
Constitution, state courts may exercise personal jurisdiction over nonresidents
who have “minimum contacts” with the forum state. (International Shoe Co. v.
Washington (1945) 326 U.S. 310, 316.) Minimum contacts exist when the
relationship between the nonresident and the forum state is such that the
exercise of jurisdiction does not offend “traditional notions of fair play and
substantial justice.” (Id. at p. 316.) The primary focus of the personal
jurisdiction inquiry is the relationship of the defendant to the forum state. (Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co. v. Superior Court of California, San Francisco County (2017)
137 S.Ct. 1773 (hereafter Bristol-Myers).) 
 
“Minimum contacts exist where the defendant’s conduct in the forum
state is such that he should reasonably anticipate being subject to suit there,
and it is reasonable and fair to force him to do so.” (F. Hoffman-La Roche,
Ltd. v. Superior Court (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 782, 795, citing World–Wide
Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson (1980) 444 U.S. 286, 297; Kulko v.
California Superior Court (1978) 436 U.S. 84, 92; Pavlovich v. Superior
Court (2002) 29 Cal.4th 262, 269.) 
 
Personal jurisdiction may be either general or specific. General (also
called all-purpose) jurisdiction means that a defendant's contacts with a state
are sufficiently extensive that the “defendant is ‘essentially at home,’ ” and
the court may exercise jurisdiction over the defendant regardless of whether
the claims relate to the forum state.  (Ford
Motor Company v. Montana Eighth Judicial District Court (2021) 141
S.Ct. 1017, 1024; Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S. A. v. Brown
(2011) 564 U.S. 915, 919.) 
 

Specific personal jurisdiction hinges on the “ ‘relationship among the
defendant, the forum, and the litigation.’ ” (Daimler AG v. Bauman (2014)
571 U.S.117, 133; accord Walden v. Fiore (2014) 571 U.S. 277, 284.)  Such jurisdiction requires “ ‘an affiliation
between the forum and the underlying controversy, principally, [an] activity or
an occurrence that takes place in the forum State and is therefore subject to
the State’s regulation.’ ” (Bristol-Myers, supra, 137 S.Ct. at p. 1780.)
Consistent with the constraints of due process, “the defendant’s suit-related
conduct must create a substantial connection with the forum State.” (Walden
v. Fiore, supra, 134 S.Ct. at p. 1115.) 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Specially appearing Defendant Sulock moves to quash service of the
summons and complaint on the basis that California lacks personal jurisdiction
over Sulock.  
 
The unverified complaint alleges that the unspecified conduct
constituting the unspecified intentional tort occurred in West Hollywood on
July 31, 2023. (See Complaint,  pp. 1-3.)  Notwithstanding, Sulock has advanced an affidavit
in which she states in pertinent part:
 
·        
I work at Marshall Dennehey's headquarters in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 
·        
I live and work in Pennsylvania. 
·        
Pennsylvania is my state-of-domicile, as that is
where live permanently, and where I vote, pay taxes, have a vehicle registered,
etc. 
·        
I do not live—either on a temporary or permanent
basis— in California. 
·        
I own no real or personal property, am not
registered to vote, and pay no taxes in California. 
·        
I do not work—either on a temporary or permanent
basis—in California.
·        
I was counsel for a defendant in a lawsuit filed
in the Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, captioned as Nation
v. Impact Services Inc., et ai., Case No. 211102123. The plaintiff in that case
is the same Plaintiff in this case. 
·        
My client in that case was dismissed via
preliminary objections, which, for the benefit of this Court, is Pennsylvania's
equivalent of a motion to quash. 
·        
All of my conduct in Nation v. Impact Services
was in the role of counsel to a party, and everything I did with respect to
that case was in Pennsylvania. 
·        
The court also (as stated) is located in
Pennsylvania. 
·        
Following the dismissal of my client in Nation
v. Impact Services, I was then sued personally in the Court of Common Pleas of
Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, in a case captioned as Nation v. Sulock,
Case No. 221000966. The plaintiff in that case was the Plaintiff in this case. 
·        
This second case was dismissed by the trial
court sua sponte on the basis that it was frivolous. This can be seen by the
dismissal order's citation of Pa.R.Civ.P. 240(j)(1). 
·        
This case, too, was filed in a court located in
Pennsylvania. 
·        
I had no contact whatsoever with California in
connection with either Nation v. Impact Services, No. 211102123, or Nation
v. Sulock, Case No. 221000966.
 
(Affidavit
of Alesia Sulock, ¶¶ 3-16.)  
 
Plaintiff has not opposed Sulock’s motion to quash, and therefore,
Plaintiff has not proffered any evidence challenging Sulock’s assertion that
she lacks minimum contacts with California. 
Thus, Plaintiff has failed to meet his burden to establish that
California has general or specific personal jurisdiction over Sulock.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
            For the reasons stated, the Court
grants Specially Appearing Sulock’s Motion to Quash.  
 
            Further, the Court sets an Order to
Show Cause re Monetary Sanctions for failure to serve the summons and complaint
pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 3.110, on November 29, 2023 at 8:30
A.M.   Plaintiff shall appear in person
at the Order to Show Cause hearing.  
 
            The
Clerk of the Court shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling.
