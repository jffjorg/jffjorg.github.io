## English Summary:

The Judge ruled in favor of Defendant Alesia Sulock, granting her motion to quash service of the lawsuit because California lacks personal jurisdiction over her. 

The Judge found that Sulock, a lawyer residing and working in Pennsylvania, has no connection to California and therefore didn't meet the "minimum contacts" requirement for the court to exercise jurisdiction. 

Since the Plaintiff did not oppose the motion, the Judge ruled in Sulock's favor. However, the Judge also scheduled an Order to Show Cause hearing for Plaintiff to explain why they shouldn't be sanctioned for failing to properly serve the lawsuit.
