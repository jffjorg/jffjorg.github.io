And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash service of summons and complaint filed by Defendant Alesia Sulock. Sulock argues that California lacks personal jurisdiction over her because she has no connections to the state. The Judge agrees, finding that Sulock has not established any minimum contacts with California. The Plaintiff, Hunter Nation, has not opposed Sulock's motion, and therefore has failed to meet their burden of proof. The Judge grants Sulock's motion to quash and sets an order to show cause for monetary sanctions for the Plaintiff's failure to serve the summons and complaint properly.
