And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants plaintiff James Davidson's motion to set aside the dismissal of the case and set it for a case management conference. The case was initially dismissed without prejudice after plaintiff's counsel failed to appear at the scheduled case management conference and order to show cause. The plaintiff has since retained new counsel, Noah Green, and argues that since no discovery had taken place at the time of dismissal, there would be no prejudice to vacating the dismissal. The court cites California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) §473, which allows the court to relieve a party from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.
