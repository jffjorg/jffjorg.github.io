Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English:

The court has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment in this unlawful detainer action. The court found that the defendant failed to present sufficient evidence to establish that the notice requirements under the Glendale Municipal Code were not met. The court noted that the plaintiff had served a 60-day Notice to Quit with permits and construction estimates attached, and that the defendant's arguments that the permits and estimates were falsified were not supported by evidence. The court concluded that there are triable issues of fact and that the motion for summary judgment should be denied.
