BACKGROUND
 
            On December
4, 2019, Plaintiff Mark Merrens sued Defendants Viking River Cruises, Inc., Rostislav
Karchemsky, and Vikram Nair, asserting fourteen causes of action including FEHA
violations, whistleblower retaliation, and wrongful termination. 
 
            On January
26, 2024, Defendant Nair filed a Motion to Quash Service of Summons. On March
19, 2024 the Court granted the Motion to Quash. 
 
            Before the
Court is Defendant Nair’s Motion to Dismiss pursuant to CCP § 583.250. Nair
asserts that Plaintiff did not serve him with the Complaint within three years
of filing this action.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
“The summons
and complaint shall be served upon a defendant within three years after the
action is commenced against the defendant. For the purpose of this subdivision,
an action is commenced at the time the complaint is filed.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
583.210, subd. (a).) If a party is not served with the summons and complaint
within three years of the action being commenced: “(1) The action shall not be
further prosecuted and no further proceedings shall be held in the action. (2)
The action shall be dismissed by the court on its own motion or on motion of
any person interested in the action, whether named as a party or not, after
notice to the parties.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 583.250, subds. (a)(1)-(2).) 
 
Nair declares that he was not served with the summons and/or
complaint until February 16, 2024, 4 years, 1 month and 28 days after the
filing of the complaint on December 4, 2019. 
 
            In opposition to
the motion, Plaintiff declares that on December 10, 2020, the entire action was
stayed pending binding arbitration. Plaintiff also states that despite best
efforts, Plaintiff was unable to serve Defendant Nair until February 16, 2024. Plaintiff
contends that the service period was tolled pursuant to CCP § 583.240(a) because
Nair was not amenable to service from December 4, 2019 to December 27, 2023 or
February 16, 2024. 
 
The fact that a defendant is absent from the state or concealed
within the state to avoid service does not warrant tolling under CCP §
583.240(a). (Watts v. Crawford (1995) 10 Cal.4th 743, 758, fn. 13.) A
person may be served outside of the State of California. (Code Civ. Proc., §
415.40.) “California grants its courts the power to assert personal
jurisdiction over out-of-state parties to the maximum extent that the state and
federal Constitutions allow.” (Doe v. Damron (2021) 70 Cal.App.5th 684,
689.) And Plaintiff does not present any evidence that Defendant Nair was not
amenable to service of process. Plaintiff’s counsel merely declares that “[d]espite
Plaintiff’s best efforts, Plaintiff was unable to serve Vikram Nair.” (Beck
Decl., ¶ 3.) 
 
Plaintiff also argues that the service period was tolled because
the entire action was stayed. But the stay did not stay service. The Court
notes that, in Plaintiff’s Motion to Lift Stay, Plaintiff took the opposite position
– that the stay did not stay service on Nair. (See Motion to Lift Stay at p. 5:20-7:4.)
Plaintiff is judicially estopped from now taking the opposite position. “Judicial
estoppel prevents a party from asserting a position in a legal proceeding that
is contrary to a position previously taken in the same or earlier proceeding.”
(Jackson v. County of Los Angeles (1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 171, 181.) “[J]udicial
estoppel is especially appropriate where a party has taken inconsistent
positions in separate proceedings.” (Ibid.) 
 
Plaintiff served Defendant Nair with the summons and complaint more
than four years after this action commenced. Plaintiff has not met his burden
in showing excusable delay. “The dismissal statute gives a remedy for delay in
prosecution of an action, and makes it mandatory upon the court to dismiss
it after three years, unless the defendant is absent or conceals himself.” (Pease
v. City of San Diego (1949) 93 Cal.App.2d 706, 709, emphasis in original.) 
Defendant Nair is entitled to recover his costs. A prevailing party
includes a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered. (Code Civ. Proc., §
1032, subd. (a)(4).) “[A] prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to
recover costs in any action or proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd.
(b).) Nair may file and serve a Memorandum of Costs pursuant to California Rules
of Court, Rule 3.1700.
