```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to set aside the demurrer and entry of judgment with prejudice. The demurrer was sustained without leave to amend, and the judgment was entered due to Plaintiffs' counsel's failure to appear at the hearing. The judge found that the neglect was excusable and that a reasonably prudent person might have made the same mistake. The court also imposed a penalty of $1,000 against Plaintiffs' counsel payable to Defense counsel for the additional attorney fees incurred as a result of the admitted error. The judge declined to consider the argument from Plaintiff regarding proper venue and directed submission of an interlocutory judgment in abatement in conformance with Code of Civil Procedure section 597.
