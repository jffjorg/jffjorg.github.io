And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Quinn Emanuel Urauhart & Sullivan LLP's motion to file certain exhibits and a declaration under seal. The exhibits and declaration contain confidential information, including a written engagement agreement and an arbitration award, which are subject to attorney-client privilege and confidentiality agreements. The judge finds that there is an overriding interest in sealing these documents, as they contain confidential communications between the law firm and its client. The judge also notes that the motion is narrowly tailored and that there is no less restrictive means of protecting the confidential information.
