Summary in English text:
The tentative ruling sustains the demurrer of defendants American Home Improvement, Inc. and Moshe Ben-Nissan to the second amended complaint (SAC) without leave to amend. The demurrer argues that the first, third, fourth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and eleventh causes of action are barred by the doctrine of res judicata/claim preclusion. The ruling holds that the SAC does not state any new claims related to the work performed by the defendants and that the claims already adjudicated in the arbitration proceeding with the California Contractors State License Board are barred by res judicata. The motion to strike is denied as moot since the claims already adjudicated are barred by res judicata.

The court takes judicial notice of three documents: the home improvement contract between the plaintiff and defendant, the plaintiff's submission to voluntary arbitration with the California Contractors State License Board, and the arbitration award from the California Contractors State License Board.

The ruling concludes that the plaintiff has failed to show that the SAC can be successfully amended to exclude the claims already adjudicated and that the claims already adjudicated are barred by res judicata.
