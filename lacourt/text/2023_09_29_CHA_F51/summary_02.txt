Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to advance the hearing date for the plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction. The defendants had requested that the hearing date be brought forward due to the reissuance of a building permit for an accessory dwelling unit (ADU) on their property. The plaintiff argued that the reissuance of the permit does not moot their need for additional discovery to investigate whether an illegal ADU previously existed on the property. The judge agrees with the plaintiff and declines to decide at this stage that the reissuance of the permit effectively moots the need for additional discovery.

Additionally, the judge finds that the defendants are estopped from bringing the motion to advance the hearing date due to their previous conduct. The defendants had requested a continuance of the relevant deposition and hearing dates, and the plaintiff had relied on this continuance. The judge finds that the defendants are taking unfair advantage of the additional time allowed to them by the stipulation to first seek a revised permit, then cancel the deposition of one of the defendants, and now to advance the hearing date. As a result, the motion is denied.
