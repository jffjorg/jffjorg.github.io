```

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to advance the hearing date for the plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction. The defendants had requested that the hearing date be brought forward due to the reissuance of a building permit for an accessory dwelling unit (ADU) on their property. The plaintiff argued that the reissuance of the permit does not moot their need for additional discovery to investigate whether an illegal ADU previously existed on the property. The judge agrees with the plaintiff and declines to decide at this stage that the reissuance of the permit effectively moots the need for additional discovery.

Additionally, the judge finds that the defendants are estopped from bringing the motion to advance the hearing date due to their previous conduct. The defendants had requested a continuance of the relevant deposition and hearing dates, and the plaintiff had relied on this continuance. The judge finds that the defendants are taking unfair advantage of the additional time allowed to them by the stipulation to first seek a revised permit, then cancel the deposition of one of the defendants, and now to advance the hearing date. As a result, the motion is denied.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to advance the hearing date for the plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction. The defendants had requested that the hearing date be moved up, citing the reissuance of a building permit that allows for the construction of an ADU encompassing the entire accessory building. However, the judge found that the reissuance of the permit did not moot the plaintiff's need for additional discovery. Additionally, the judge held that the defendants were estopped from bringing the instant motion to advance the hearing date, as they had previously requested a continuance of the relevant deposition and hearing dates and had benefited from the additional time.

The judge also sustained the plaintiff's evidentiary objections and reminded the parties of the importance of complying with the technical requirements for electronic filing. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in papers being rejected, matters being placed off calendar, or the imposition of sanctions.

English text:
The Judge denies the Defendants' motion to advance the hearing date for Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction. Plaintiff’s evidentiary objections are sustained. Defendants are reminded to comply with electronic filing requirements. The Judge finds that Defendants are estopped from bringing the motion to advance the stipulated 11/28/23 hearing date. The Judge acknowledges Defendants' delay and cost but denies the motion due to lack of legal authority supporting the argument that the issuance of a building permit for an ADU moots the need for investigation.
