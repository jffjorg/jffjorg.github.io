ANALYSIS:
 
 
I.         
Legal
Standard
 
“If, after service of a deposition
notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or
employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that is a party
under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section
2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce
for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move
for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the
production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.450, subd. (a).)
 
“If a motion under subdivision (a)
is granted, the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and
against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless
the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g).)
 
II.      
Discussion
 
Plaintiffs request that the Court: (1) compel Defendant TRC’s person
most qualified to appear for a deposition; (2) compel the person most qualified
to produce documents without objections; (3) compel Dragana Stikepovic, who is
allegedly an employee of Defendant TRC, to appear for a deposition; and (4)
sanction Defendant TRC and its counsel one dollar for each of the motions. (Motion
to Compel TRC’s PMQ, p. 13:15–18; Motion to Compel Stikepovic, p. 13:15–18.)
 
Plaintiffs argue: (1) that Plaintiffs are entitled to an order
compelling TRC’s PMQ and Dragana Stikepovic to attend their depositions; (2)
that good cause justifies the production of the documents requested, as
described in the deposition notices; (3) that Defendants have not served
objections to the deposition notice or the production of documents; (4) that
Plaintiffs’ Counsel has met and conferred with Defense Counsel; (5) that
Plaintiffs are entitled to sanctions against Defendant TRC and its counsel; and
(6) that Defendant TRC has engaged in delay tactics. (Motion to Compel TRC’s
PMQ, pp. 9:1–2, 10:11–12, 11:1–2, 11:4–5, 11:9–10, 12:1–2; Motion to Compel
Stikepovic, pp. 9:1–2, 10:1–2, 11:1–2, 11:6–7, 12:1–2.)
 
Defendants DaVita, Inc. and TRC oppose the motions, arguing: (1) that
there is no basis to compel the person most qualified and Dragana Stikepovic;
(2) that Plaintiffs’ demands are unreasonable and unjustified; (3) that
Plaintiffs have reasonable alternative remedies to obtain the information at
issue; (4) that there is no authority for an order compelling these depositions
because there has not been a failure to appear for a deposition; and (5) that
sanctions are not warranted because Defendant TRC is substantially justified in
requesting the depositions occur after all parties have appeared in the case
and at a mutually agreeable time. (Opposition to Motion to Compel TRC’s PMQ,
pp. 4:12, 4:24, 6:10–11, 6:18–19, 7:16–19; Opposition to Motion to Compel
Stijepovic, pp. 4:13–14, 5:2, 6:17–19, 7:10–13.)
 
 Defendant TRC has been in this
litigation since June 13, 2023. Further, Defendant TRC, having not appeared
specially to contest the Court’s jurisdiction over it, has waived any issues
with service and personal jurisdiction. It is irrelevant that Defendant TRC has
not previously defied a deposition or that certain other parties have not yet
filed pleadings in this matter. Plaintiffs have a right to depose TRC’s
employee and TRC’s person most qualified; nothing Defendants DaVita, Inc. or
TRC have argued sufficiently explains why Plaintiffs should have to wait any
longer to conduct the depositions discussed above. 
 
As to sanctions, Plaintiffs indicate that they spent $4,550.00 in
attorney's fees preparing the motion to compel the deposition of the PMK.  (Berokiim Declaration, ¶ 20, attached to
Motion.)  “However, in good faith, and to
simply accomplish the underlying objective of moving this case along,
Plaintiffs seek the discounted amount of one dollar in sanctions.”  (Id.) 
Similarly, Plaintiffs seek $1.00 in sanctions for preparing the motion
to compel the Stijepovich deposition. 
(Berokiim Declaration, ¶ 19, attached to Motion.)  
 
        As
indicated above in the “Background,” the Court held an Informal Discovery
Conference on these issues on September 21, 2023.  The parties agreed at that Informal Discovery
Conference to produce the deponent within 30 days.  It is not clear to this Court why this motion
was not taken off-calendar or why the Court was required to spend 30 minutes at
an Informal Discovery Conference, and an additional several hours preparing
this analysis.  
 
        The
Court GRANTS the request for sanctions of $2.00.
 
 
 
III.     Conclusion
 
The Motion to Compel TRC’s PMQ and the Motion to Compel Stijepovic are
GRANTED. Defendant TRC shall make Dragana Stijepovic and TRC’s PMQ available
for deposition within 30 days of the issuance of this Order. 
 
        Sanctions
of $2.00 are imposed against Defendant and its attorney, jointly and
separately.
