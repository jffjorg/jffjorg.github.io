And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the Motions to Strike Portions of the Answer and Cross-Complaint are denied. The motions were filed by the plaintiffs, who sought to strike any and all references to the arbitrators' award and determinations, including exhibits, from the Answer and Cross-Complaint. The plaintiffs argued that the arbitrators' award and determinations are inadmissible under Business & Professions Code section 6204, subdivision (e), irrelevant, and improper, and therefore must be stricken. The defendants and cross-complainant argued that the motions are impermissible because they go beyond the corners of the pleadings, that the affirmative defenses and breach of contract claim are properly pleaded, and that they are entitled to plead the recovery of fees. The judge found that the defendants and cross-complainant are entitled to allege that there is an arbitration award that is relevant to this matter, and that it will ultimately be their burden to prove that they are entitled to the relief they seek via their cause of action and their affirmative defense. The judge also noted that the Business & Professions Code section 6204 explicitly contemplates consideration of and comparison with any existing arbitration award.
