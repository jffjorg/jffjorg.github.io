Summary:

The tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to compel production of documents under CCP § 1987, finding that the requests are overly broad and lack specificity. The court finds that the plaintiff has not shown good cause for the production of the documents, and that the requests are not supported by sufficient evidence. The court also finds that the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that the documents are in the possession or control of the defendants. The ruling does not preclude the plaintiff from filing a motion under CCP § 3295 seeking an order to discover the defendants' financial condition for purposes of assessing punitive damages.
