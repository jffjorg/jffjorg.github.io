Interrogatories (Set One) and Requests for Production (Set One) filed by Defendant
Yongun Park.
 
Tentative
The motions are granted.
The requests for sanctions are granted in
part.
Background
This case arises out of a motor
vehicle accident on January 29, 2020, on the 101 Freeway near the Universal
Studios exit in Los Angeles.
 
On January 10, 2022, Plaintiff David Choe (“Plaintiff”)
filed the complaint in this matter against Defendants Yongun Park (“Defendant”)
and Does 1 through 50, asserting causes of action for general negligence and motor
vehicle negligence.
 
On May 24, 2023, Defendant filed an answer.
 
On that same day (May 24), Defendant served Plaintiff with
discovery requests, including Form Interrogatories (Set One) and Requests for
Production (Set One).  (Daryanavard
Decls., ¶ 4 & Exhs. 1.)  Plaintiff
never served responses.  (Id., ¶ 6.)   
On November 20, 2023, Defendant filed the two motions before
the Court seeking orders compelling Plaintiff to respond to Defendant’s Form
Interrogatories (Set One) and Requests for Production (Set One).  Defendant also seeks sanctions.
Plaintiff has not filed any opposition to either motion.
Legal Standard
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely response, the propounding
party may move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290;
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In
addition, a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)
A party must respond to requests for production of
documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents are directed
does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) There
is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and
confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves
to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the court shall impose
a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion],
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (c).)
In Chapter 7
of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010,
subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include
“[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd. (a).)
“[P]roviding untimely responses does not divest the
trial court of its authority [to hear a motion to compel responses].”  (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.,
supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 407.)  Even
if the untimely response “does not contain objections [and] substantially
resolve[s] the issues raised by a motion to compel responses … the trial court
retains the authority to hear the motion.”¿ (Id. at pp. 408-409.)¿ This rule gives “an important incentive for parties to
respond to discovery in a timely fashion.”¿ (Id. at p. 408.)¿ If “the propounding party [does not] take the motion off
calendar or narrow its scope to the issue of sanctions,”
the trial court may “deny the motion to compel responses as essentially
unnecessary, in whole or in part, and just impose sanctions.”¿ (Id. at p. 409.) “The court may award sanctions
under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel
discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to
the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving
party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).)  
Discussion
On May 24, 2023, Defendant served Plaintiff with Form
Interrogatories (Set One) and Requests for Production (Set One). (Daryanavard
Decls., ¶ 4 & Exh. 1.)  Plaintiff
never served responses.  (Id., ¶
6.)   
Defendant need show nothing more.  The motions to compel are GRANTED.
Defendant’s requests for sanctions are GRANTED in
part and DENIED in part.  
On the motion to compel responses to the requests
for production, the Court sets sanctions in the amount of $290.  This is the amount requested in the notice of
motion and motion, and it is supported by adequate evidence in the declaration
of counsel.
On the motion to compel responses to the form
interrogatories, Defendant seeks sanctions of $750.  Given the relatively straightforward nature
of a motion to compel initial responses, and the economies of scale associated
with filing multiple discovery motions, the Court sets sanctions on each motion
in the amount of $560, calculated based on 2 hours of attorney work, multiplied
by a reasonable billing rate of $250 per hour, plus a $60 filing fee.  
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s motions to compel Plaintiff to
respond to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories (Set One) and Requests for
Production (Set One).  
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff to serve verified, code-compliant
written responses, without objection, to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories (Set
One) within 21 days of notice.
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff to serve verified, code-compliant
written responses, without objection, to Defendant’s Requests for Production (Set
One) within 21 days of notice.
Defendant’s requests for sanctions are GRANTED in part and
DENIED in part.  
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff to pay monetary sanctions to
Defendant under the Civil Discovery Act in the total amount of $850 within 30
days of notice of this order.
Moving party is ORDERED to give notice.
