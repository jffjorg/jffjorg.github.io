The court has ordered the plaintiff to serve verified, code-compliant written responses to the defendant's discovery requests within 21 days of notice. Additionally, the court has awarded the defendant monetary sanctions in the amount of $850, which includes $290 for the requests for production and $560 for the form interrogatories. The court has also ordered the plaintiff to pay the filing fee of $60.
