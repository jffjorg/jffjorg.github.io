 Case Number:  BC709284    Hearing Date:   February 28, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Set Aside Dismissal and Enter Judgment, filed
by Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company. 
 
Tentative
The motion is granted.
Background
On November 6, 2023, Plaintiff State Farm Mutual
Automobile Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) filed this motion to set aside
dismissal and enter judgment against Defendant Erin Lisenbee (“Defendant”). No
opposition has been filed.
 
On March 7,
2022, Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a written stipulation for the entry
of judgment, which would be discharged upon the payment of $12,181.94. (Exh. A.)
 
Legal
Standard
Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6
provides that “[i]f parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing
signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally before the
court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may
enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6.)  In ruling on a motion to enter judgment, the
court acts as a trier of fact.  The court
must determine whether the parties entered into a valid and binding
settlement.  To do so, the court may
receive oral testimony in addition to declarations.  (Kohn v. Jaymar-Ruby, Inc. (1994) 23
Cal.App.4th 1530, 1533.)
“[W]here the plaintiff has filed a voluntary
dismissal of an action …, the court is without jurisdiction to act further …,
and any subsequent orders of the court are simply void.” (Paniagua v. Orange
County Fire Auth. (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 83, 89, (internal quotes
omitted).) The result is different where a signed, written settlement agreement
(or oral settlement before the court) states the court retains jurisdiction to
enforce the settlement because that agreement could be enforced under C.C.P. §
664.6. (See Wackeen v. Malis (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 429, 439-440; Khavarian
Enterprises, Inc. v. Commline, Inc. (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 310, 326—court
had continuing jurisdiction to consider attorney fees and costs motions after
dismissal where settlement agreement provided court retained jurisdiction to
enforce agreement pursuant to CCP § 664.6.)) 
C.C.P. § 664.6(a) states: “If requested by
the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the
settlement.” Counsel may sign the request on behalf of their clients (C.C.P. §
664.6(b)(2) (added eff. 1/1/21)). The request should be made while the court
still has jurisdiction. (Wackeen v. Malis, supra, 97 CA4th at
433; see Sayta v. Chu (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 960, 962.)
 
Discussion
On March 7,
2022, Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a written stipulation for the entry
of judgment, which would be discharged upon the payment of $12,181.94. (Exh.
A.)
Defendant was to
pay $700.00 a month; Defendant’s insurance carrier made a one-time payment of
$9,181.94. (Reese Decl., ¶¶ 4 & 5; Exh. C.) A default letter was sent to
Defendant on June 19, 2023, no payment was made within 14 days. (Id., ¶¶
6& 7.)
 
The Stipulation
Agreement appears to have been executed, with signatures from the two parties. (Exhibit
A.) As such, there is a valid agreement.
 
On June
27, 20222, the stipulation was filed with the Court to allow the Court
jurisdiction to enforce the stipulation. (Exhibit A, ¶ 3.) The Order for Dismissal
and Court Retaining Jurisdiction was signed on September 9, 2022. (Exh. B.) Therefore,
the Court has jurisdiction to enforce this Stipulation Agreement.
 
Plaintiff
contends Defendant failed to make payments and that the balance due is $2,800.00.
(Reese Decl., ¶ 8.) This amount includes filing fee, service fee, and motion
fee. (Id.) 
 
The Court finds Plaintiff has established that
there was a valid agreement between the parties, that the Court retains
jurisdiction, and that there is a need to set aside the dismissal and enter
judgment against Defendant.
Therefore, the Court GRANTS the motion to set
aside the dismissal and enter judgment against Defendant.
 
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS the motion to set aside the
dismissal. Judgment is entered against Defendant for $2,800.00. 
Moving Party is
ORDERED to give notice.
