And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a motor vehicle collision that occurred on December 3, 2020. The plaintiff, Hengameh Hakaeian, filed a lawsuit against the defendants, ACCO Engineered Systems, Inc. and Jon Eric Sohegian, on November 9, 2022. The defendants failed to provide timely responses to the plaintiff's requests for production, and the plaintiff filed motions to compel initial responses and seek sanctions.

The judge has denied the motions to compel initial responses as moot, as the defendants have provided belated initial responses. The judge has granted the plaintiff's request for sanctions in part, ordering each defendant to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $561.65 within 30 days of notice. The judge has also set sanctions on each motion in the amount of $561.65, calculated based on 1 hour of attorney work, multiplied by the attorney's billing rate of $500 per hour plus a $61.65 filing fee.
