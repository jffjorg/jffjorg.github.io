And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to compel further response to Special Interrogatory No. 25. The motion is denied because the defendant did not comply with the mandatory requirement to submit a meet-and-confer declaration with the moving papers. The judge finds that the defendant's efforts to meet and confer with the plaintiff were inadequate, and that the plaintiff's objections to the interrogatory are without merit. The judge also finds that the defendant's request for sanctions is denied because the defendant has acted with substantial justification. The court orders that the defendant give notice of the ruling.
