And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies Defendant John Fitzgerald Gomillion's motion to continue the trial. The motion was filed on February 13, 2024, citing the need for new counsel to prepare for trial. However, the court finds that this is not good cause for a continuance, as the substitution of counsel was voluntary and not due to any external factors such as death, disability, or other excusable circumstances. The court also notes that the new counsel should have considered the trial date and the policy that "the dates assigned for a trial are firm" before accepting the representation. Therefore, the motion to continue is denied.
