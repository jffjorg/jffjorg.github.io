The judge has excused the personal appearance of the claimants and the guardian ad litem, allowing counsel to appear by telephone or video conference instead. The judge has also continued the hearing due to the fact that the petitions filed by the petitioner contain faint and illegible attachments. The judge has ordered the petitioner to refile the petitions with legible attachments at least five court days prior to the continued hearing date. The petitioner is also ordered to give notice of the continued hearing.
