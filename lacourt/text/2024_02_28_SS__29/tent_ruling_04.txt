Ekmekjian (Age 10) and Arthur Ekmekjian (Age 11).
 
TENTATIVE:
 
The Court excuses the personal appearance of the
claimants and the guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by telephone or video
conference call.  
 
On February
8, 2024, the Court (by written minute order) advised the parties that both petitions
contained attachments that were faint and illegible and continued the hearings
so that the petitions could be refiled.  Counsel
appeared and waived notice.
 
Petitioner
did not refile until February 26, just two court days before the continued
hearing date.  The new petitions still contain
faint and illegible attachments, as follows.
 
On both
petitions: (1) Attachment 14a (described as Itemization of Medical Expenses);
(2) Attachment 14b (described as Rawlings Final Lien Letter)
 
Accordingly,
Petitioners’ Expedited Petitions to Approve Minor’s Compromise of Alexander
Ekmekjian (Age 10) and Arthur Ekmekjian (Age 11) are CONTINUED again to allow
Petitioner to refile petitions with legible attachments. 
 
Such
petitions and attachments must be filed at least five court days prior to the
continued hearing date.
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
