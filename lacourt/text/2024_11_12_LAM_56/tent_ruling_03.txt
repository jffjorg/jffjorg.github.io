The
Court has considered the moving papers. 
No opposition has been filed.  Any
opposition was required to have been filed and served at least nine court days
prior to the hearing.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1005, subd. (b).)
 
BACKGROUND
              This
action arose from a Statement of Claim filed by Respondent against Petitioner
on or about October 25, 2022 with Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
Dispute Resolution (“FINRA”).  (Amended
Declaration of Bentley P. Stansbury [“Stansbury Decl.”], ¶ 2.)  Both Petitioner and Respondent signed a FINRA
Submission Agreement consenting to arbitration before FINRA
(“Arbitration”).  (Id., ¶¶ 3,5,
Exhs. A and B.)  On or about October 12,
2023, Petitioner filed a Petition for Expungement Recommendation on Behalf of
Unnamed Party Janelle O’Brien in the Arbitration.  (Id., ¶ 6.)  FINRA Public Arbitrators Benjamin F.
Breslauer, Aurelio A. Garcia, and Carmen Theresa Herrera were duly appointed as
the arbitration panel by FINRA and were accepted by all parties.  (Id., ¶ 7.)
 
            On
or about May 3, 2024, FINRA served Petitioner and Respondent with the Arbitration
Award (the “Award”), providing as follows:


            
(Id., Exh. C.)

 
Petitioner
now moves to confirm the Arbitration Award by filing the instant petition.
 
DISCUSSION
            “Any party to an arbitration in
which an award has been made may petition the court to confirm, correct or
vacate the award. The petition shall name as respondents all parties to the
arbitration and may name as respondents any other persons bound by the arbitration
award.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.) “A petition under this chapter shall: (a)
Set forth the substance of or have attached a copy of the agreement to
arbitrate unless the petitioner denies the existence of such an agreement. (b)
Set forth the names of the arbitrators. (c) Set forth or have attached a copy
of the award and the written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1285.4.) “If a petition or response under this chapter is duly served
and filed, the court shall confirm the award as made…unless in accordance with
this chapter it corrects the award and confirms it as corrected, vacates the
award or dismisses the proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1286.) Any response to
the petition is required to be filed and served within 10 days after service of
the petition. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.6.) 
 
The
Court finds that Petitioner has established that the procedural requirements
have been met. There being no response, the Court finds that the arbitration
award is proper to confirm. “If [an] award is confirmed, judgment must be
entered in conformity therewith.”  (Jones
v. Kvistad (1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 836, 840.) 
            
RULING
Based
on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS Petitioner’s motion to confirm arbitration
award. 
 
The
Court orders Petitioner to file and serve a proposed judgment within 10 days of
the date of this order. 
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
