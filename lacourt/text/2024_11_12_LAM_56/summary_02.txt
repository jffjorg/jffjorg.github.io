And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted a motion filed by counsel for the defendants, Love Thy Keeper, LLC and Ryan Ronal Johnson, to withdraw as counsel. The motion was unopposed and the judge found that the counsel had adequately established grounds for withdrawal. The judge noted that while Ryan Ronal Johnson can appear in propria persona, Love Thy Keeper, LLC must appear by counsel and therefore scheduled an Order to Show Cause (OSC) regarding the company's representation by counsel for December 10, 2024. The judge's ruling is tentative and parties who intend to submit on the ruling must send an email to the court as directed by the instructions on the court website.
