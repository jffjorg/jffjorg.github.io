  CASE NO.:  21STCV32001
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
Date: November 12, 2024
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
 
 



 
BACKGROUND
            This action arises out of an alleged
breach of a settlement agreement.  The
currently operative Second Amended Complaint alleges a sole cause of action for
breach of written contract.  
 
            Counsel for Defendants Love Thy
Keepers, LLC and Ryan Ronal Johnson (collectively, “Defendants”), FREUNDLEGAL,
Craig Huber and Stephen Crump (“Counsel”), seek to withdraw as counsel for both
Defendants, and filed this motion to be relieved as counsel (the “Motion”) on October
7, 2024.  The Motion is compliant with California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, and is unopposed. 
Trial in this action is not yet set. 
 
DISCUSSION
The court has discretion on whether to allow an
attorney to withdraw, and a motion to withdraw will not be granted where
withdrawal would prejudice the client. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  Withdrawal is
generally permitted unless there is a compelling reason to continue the
representation.  (Heple v. Kluge
(1951) 104 Cal.App.2d 461, 462.)  
 
In connection with the Motion, Counsel declares, as
ground for the Motion, that “[n]either client consents to substitution, and both
clients have rendered it unreasonably difficult to continue to represent their
interests.”
 
The
Court finds that the Motion sets forth adequate bases for withdrawal.  The Court, therefore, GRANTS the Motion. The Court
notes that while Ryan Ronal Johnson can appear in propria persona, Love
Thy Keepers, LLC must appear by counsel and cannot defend itself at trial
without being represented by counsel.  The Court will, therefore, hold an OSC
regarding Love Thy Keepers, LLC’s representation by counsel on December 10,
2024, at 8:30 a.m. in this Department. 
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the
department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
 
Dated this 12th day of November 2024
