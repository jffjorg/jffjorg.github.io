  CASE NO.:  24STCV04497
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
MOTION TO QUASH DEPOSITION SUBPOENAS FOR
  THE PRODUCTION OF RECORDS ISSUED BY
WALTER ROBINSON
 
Date: November 12, 2024
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
 
 



 
BACKGROUND
            The case stems from a motor vehicle
accident on February 25, 2023.  Plaintiff
Dara Sue Crippen (“Plaintiff”) alleges to have been injured while on a ride
arranged through Lyft’s ride-sharing service. 
The vehicle Plaintiff was riding in, driven by Defendant Walter Robinson
(“Robinson”), collided with a vehicle driven by Defendant Uriel Hernandez.
 
            On October 9, 2024, and on October
23, 2024, Plaintiff filed two separate Motions to Quash Deposition Subpoenas
for the Production of Records Issued by Walter Robinson (the “Motions”) seeking
to quash Robinson’s deposition subpoenas for the production of records to
different deponents/providers.  The Motions
are made pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 1987.1 on the grounds that the subpoenas
are overbroad, harassing, and seek to unjustifiably violate Plaintiff’s
constitutional privacy, and Defendant cannot show a legitimate interest in the
scope of the records requested.
            
Upon examination of the
proofs of service of the subject deposition subpoenas, however, the papers do
not indicate that the deponents/providers to whom the subpoenas are directed
have been served with the subpoenas as required by Code Civ. Proc. § 1987.
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motions are MOOT.
 
            Moving Party is ordered to give
notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
