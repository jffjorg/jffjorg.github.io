And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the complaint filed by Plaintiff Mahmud Reza Siamizade against Defendant Steven Meier, et al. The complaint alleges that the defendants failed to provide medical records of Mahzar Sedghi to the plaintiff and to the plaintiff's attorney or agent. The defendants demurred to the complaint, arguing that the claims are not based on recognized causes of action and that the plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to state a claim.

The court agrees that the plaintiff's claims are based on alleged violations of statutory law, but finds that the plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to support either claim. Specifically, the plaintiff did not tender a fee, as required by Health and Safety Code section 123110, for copying the patient records.

The court sustains the defendant's demurrer with 15 days leave to amend. The plaintiff will be afforded an opportunity to allege sufficient facts to support the claims.
