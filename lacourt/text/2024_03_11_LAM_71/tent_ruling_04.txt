DAMON
  ZIELINSKI,  
  
         vs.
 
COUNTY
  OF LOS ANGELES. 


 Case No.: 
  22STCV16300
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  March 11, 2024



 
Plaintiff
Damon Zielinski’s motion for an order awarding sanctions against Defendant County of Los Angeles and its
attorneys of record, David Penner and Michele Goldsmith of BLG Law Group is
denied.
Defendant’s
request for sanctions against Plaintiff is denied.
 
Plaintiff
Damon Zielinski (“Zielinski”) (“Plaintiff”) moves for an
order of sanctions against Defendant County of Los Angeles (“County”) (“Defendant”)
and its attorneys of record, David Penner and Michele Goldsmith of BLG Law
Group, in the amount of $3,860.00. 
(Notice of Motion, pgs. 1-2; C.C.P. §2030.030.)  Plaintiff moves on the grounds that Defendant
has failed to respond to discovery, made evasive responses as to discovery, and
made false representations regarding the availability of discoverable
information.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2.)
Defendant,
in opposition, requests this Court issue sanctions against Plaintiff and
Plaintiff’s attorneys of record Steven H. Haney, Kenneth W. Baisch, and George
Hill, and Haney & Shah, LLP, in the amount of $4,600.00.  (Notice of Opposition, pgs. 1-2; C.C.P.
§2023.030.)
 
Background
On
May 17, 2022, Plaintiff filed this action against Defendant for discrimination;
harassment; retaliation; failure to prevent discrimination, harassment, or retaliation
due to Plaintiff’s veteran status; and violation of Labor Code §1102.5.
On
July 5, 2023, this Court, pursuant to parties’ stipulation, ordered Defendant
to produce its person most knowledgeable (“PMK”) for deposition on May 25,
2023, and removed from the Court’s calendar Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s
PMK’s attendance at deposition.  (7/5/23
Stipulation.)
          Plaintiff filed the instant motion on November
8, 2023.  Defendant filed its opposition
on February 27, 2024.  Plaintiff filed his
reply on March 4, 2024.
 
C.C.P. §2030.030
Sanctions
C.C.P. §2030.030(a) provides:
To the extent authorized by the chapter governing any
particular discovery method or any other provision of this title, the court,
after notice to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity
for hearing, may impose the following sanctions against anyone engaging in
conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process:
 
(a) The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that
conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees,
incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. The court may also impose this
sanction on one unsuccessfully asserting that another has engaged in the misuse
of the discovery process, or on any attorney who advised that assertion, or on
both. If a monetary sanction is authorized by any provision of this title, the
court shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.
 
(C.C.P. §2023.030(a),
emphasis added.)
          The
Court of Appeal recently stated in City of Los Angeles v.
PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC that “the statutory language of section
2023.030 limiting sanctions ‘to the extent authorized’ by other provisions of
the Discovery Act” was not sufficient to sustain an award of discovery
sanctions because “no prior case law squarely held that section 2023.030
requires monetary sanctions to be authorized by another provision of the
Discovery Act.”  (City of Los Angeles
v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 505.)  The PricewaterhouseCoopers Court reversed
and remanded the lower court’s order granting discovery sanctions.  (Id.)  
While City of Los Angeles v.
PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC is pending review before the California Supreme
Court, the case may be cited, not only for its persuasive value, but also for
the limited purpose of establishing the existence of a conflict in authority
that would in turn allow trial courts to exercise discretion under Auto
Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court (1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 456, to choose
between sides of any such conflict.  (City
of Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers (Cal. 2023) 303 Cal.Rptr.3d 669,
669.)
          The
Court finds the PricewaterhouseCoopers Court’s rationale to be
persuasive and declines to award sanctions on the basis Plaintiff’s motion fails
to provide an authority entitling him to the relief he seeks.
          Accordingly,
the Court declines to award sanctions on behalf of either Plaintiff or
Defendant, as noticed in their opposition.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s motion for sanctions is denied.
Defendant’s request for sanctions is denied.
Moving Party to give notice.
