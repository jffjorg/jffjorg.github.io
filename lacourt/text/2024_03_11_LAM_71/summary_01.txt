And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrers filed by Defendants Robert Assil and Oakwood Holdings LLC to Plaintiff Timothy Hennessy's second amended complaint (SAC). The Judge sustains the demurrers without leave to amend as to the 6th cause of action, which alleges intentional infliction of emotional distress. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff fails to sufficiently allege that the Defendants' conduct was intentional and directed towards causing Plaintiff severe emotional distress. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff's allegations do not explain how the Defendants allegedly defrauded the Plaintiff or identify any fraudulent actions beyond those inherent in any eviction process. The Judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure (C.C.P.) §430.10(e), (f) and various California Court of Appeal cases.
