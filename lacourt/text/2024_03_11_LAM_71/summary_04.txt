The judge also denied Defendant's request for sanctions against Plaintiff. The judge found that Plaintiff's motion failed to provide an authority entitling him to the relief he seeks, citing the recent Court of Appeal decision in City of Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC. The judge noted that the PricewaterhouseCoopers Court's rationale was persuasive and declined to award sanctions.
