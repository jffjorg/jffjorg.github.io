And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to enforce the settlement agreement, except as to the request to order the destruction of the illegal structure. The settlement agreement was filed on March 22, 2023, and provides that the defendant, Carlos Galvan Jr., would have 195 days to cure all subject violations on his property or demolish the illegal structure. The defendant did not comply with the agreement and failed to submit a complete application for a variance permit. The judge finds that the plaintiff has demonstrated that the court should issue an order enforcing the settlement agreement. The judge also orders the plaintiff to file and serve a proposed judgment within 5 days of the date of this order.
