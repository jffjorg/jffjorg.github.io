[1]The Court notes that on October 23, 2024, Plaintiff
filed a Notice of Stay of Proceedings with regard to “Defendant JNA ENGINEERING
INC. only.” The Notice of Stay attaches a U.S. Bankruptcy Court Central
District of California (Los Angeles) Bankruptcy Petition referencing the Debtor
“JNA Engineering, Inc.” The Court notes that “[a]s a general rule…because the
automatic stay protects only the debtor, the [b]ankruptcy of
one defendant in a multidefendant case does not stay the case as to the
remaining defendants.” (Higgins v. Superior
Court (2017) 15 Cal.App.5th 973,
979-980 [internal quotations omitted, emphasis in original].) 
 


[2]On May 14, 2024,
Plaintiff filed an IDC Statement for the July 3, 2024 IDC providing, inter
alia, that “Plaintiff served Defendant with a deposition notice on February
15, 2024. Defense counsel stated his office is not available for deposition set
for March 8, 2024. On four (4) different occasions, Plaintiff has reached out
to defense counsel via email requesting for other available dates. No response
from defense counsel in regards to available dates except one response stating
he cannot get a hold of his client. After almost three (3) months, no
deposition of the Defendant has taken place and no other communication has
occured [sic] since March 11, 2024.”
