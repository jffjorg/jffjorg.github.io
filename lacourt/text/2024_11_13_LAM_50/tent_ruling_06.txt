[1]The Court does not find that Defendant has shown that
any of Plaintiff’s causes of action are uncertain. Thus, the Court overrules
Defendant’s demurrer on the grounds of uncertainty. 


[2]The Court notes that the prayer for relief as to the
third, fourth, and fifth causes of action does not appear to allege that
Plaintiff seeks “damages” in connection with these causes of action.
