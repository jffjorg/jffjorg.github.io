[1]As set forth
above, paragraph 4 of the Arbitration Agreement also provides that “[t]he
parties to this Agreement specifically agree that all claims under the
California Labor Code, including, but not limited to, claims for overtime,
unpaid wages, and claims involving meal and rest breaks shall be subject to
this Arbitration Agreement…” (Refua Decl., ¶ 10, Ex. 2, ¶ 4.)
 


[2]Paragraph 61 of
the Complaint alleges, inter alia, that “[t]his cause of action is
brought pursuant to the FEHA, Govt. Code §12940(h)…”
(Compl., ¶ 61.) 
 


[3]In the reply,
Defendants assert that Plaintiff’s fifteenth cause of action for unfair
competition in violation of Business and Professions
Code section 17200, et seq. is not excluded from the Arbitration
Agreement. Defendants do not appear to make this argument in the motion. (See
Mot. at p. 7:11-16.) Moreover, as set forth above, paragraph 4 of the
Arbitration Agreement provides in part that “[t]he parties to this Agreement
specifically agree that all claims under the West’s Annotated California Government Code § 12953 are not covered by
this Agreement as well as…claims for violation of any federal, state, or
other governmental law, statute, regulation, or ordinance…” (Refua Decl., ¶ 10, Ex. 2, ¶ 4,
emphasis added.) Defendants do not appear to address this provision. 


[4]The Court notes
that Castaneda v. Property Mgmt. Assocs. 2022 Cal. Super. LEXIS 78143 is
a non-binding Superior Court case. In addition, Castaneda does not
appear to be discussed in Espejo.
