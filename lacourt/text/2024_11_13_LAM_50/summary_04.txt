```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court considers the Plaintiff's Notice of Stay of Proceedings against JNA ENGINEERING INC., which was filed on October 23, 2024. The Notice of Stay attaches a Bankruptcy Petition filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court Central District of California (Los Angeles) referencing the Debtor "JNA Engineering, Inc." The Court notes that the automatic stay, which protects only the debtor, does not apply to the remaining defendants in a multidefendant case, citing Higgins v. Superior Court (2017) 15 Cal.App.5th 973.

Additionally, the Court considers the Plaintiff's IDC Statement, which alleges that the Defendant's counsel has failed to respond to requests for alternative dates for a deposition, which was originally scheduled for March 8, 2024. The Plaintiff has reached out to the defense counsel via email on four occasions, but has received no response except one statement indicating that the counsel cannot get in touch with his client. The Court notes that no deposition has taken place and no communication has occurred since March 11, 2024.

Based on these facts, the Court will likely deny the Plaintiff's request to stay proceedings against JNA ENGINEERING INC. as the automatic stay does not apply to the remaining defendants, and the Defendant's counsel has failed to respond to requests for a deposition.
