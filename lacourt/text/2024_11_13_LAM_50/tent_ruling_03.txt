[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:
 
MOTION TO COMPEL
DEPOSITION OF DEFENDANT SUK JOO LEE AND
  REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS



 
Background
Plaintiff Hyungsoo Kim
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action on June 27, 2023 against Defendants JNA
Engineering Inc. d/b/a JNA Enterprise and Suk Joo Lee (“Lee”). The Complaint
alleges causes of action for (1) failure to pay minimum wage for all hours
worked, (2) failure to pay proper overtime, (3) failure to provide meal
periods, (4) failure to provide rest periods, 
(5) knowing and intentional failure to
maintain and provide accurate payroll records, (6) willful failure to pay wages
due at termination, and (7) violation of Business and
Professions Code section 17200, et seq.  
Plaintiff now moves for
“an order to Compel the Deposition of Defendant SUK JOO LEE…within 7
days of this Court’s ruling, and…For Sanctions jointly and severally in the
amount of $3,375.00 against Defendant SUK JOO LEE and defense counsel, Haewon
Kim, Esq.” The motion is unopposed.[1]
Discussion 
Pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 2025.280, subdivision (a), “[t]he service of a deposition
notice under Section 2025.240 is
effective to require any deponent who is a party to the action or an officer,
director, managing agent, or employee of a party to attend and to testify, as
well as to produce any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing for inspection and copying.” 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 2025.450, subdivision (a)
provides: 
“If, after service of a
deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing
agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that
is a party under Section 2025.230, without having
served a valid objection under Section 2025.410,
fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for
inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing
described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an
order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production
for inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice.”
            Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, subdivision (b)
provides:
            “A motion
under subdivision (a) shall comply with both of the following:
 
(1) The motion shall set forth specific
facts showing good cause justifying the production for inspection of any
document, electronically stored information, or
tangible thing described in the deposition notice.
 
(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a
meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040,
or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored information, or
things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the
petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.” 
Plaintiff’s counsel’s supporting
declaration provides, inter alia, that “[o]n February 15, 2024,
Plaintiff served Defendant [Suk Joo Lee] with a deposition notice for March 8,
2024.” (Kim Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. A.) “On February 20, 2024, defense counsel (Haewon
Kim, Esq.) replied stating his office is not available for deposition on March
8, 2024.” (Kim Decl., ¶ 4.) “On February 20, 2024, Plaintiff sent an email to
the defense counsel requesting other available dates in March,” and “[o]n
February 26, 2024, Plaintiff sent a second email to the defense asking
requesting other available dates in March.” (Kim Decl., ¶¶ 5-6.) “On March 11,
2024, defense counsel sent an email to plaintiff’s counsel stating he cannot
get a hold of his client.” (Kim Decl., ¶ 7.) Plaintiff’s counsel states that
“[a]fter almost 3 months, no deposition of the Defendant has taken place. Since
the last email response from Haewon Kim, Esq. on March 11, 2024, there has been
no other communication from him.” (Kim Decl., ¶ 8.) 
On July 3, 2024, an
Informal Discovery Conference (“IDC”) was held in this action. The Court’s July
3, 2024 minute order provides, inter alia, that “Plaintiff has fulfilled
the IDC requirements.”[2]  
As set forth above, “[i]f, after service of a
deposition notice, a party to the action…without having served a valid
objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear
for examination…the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).) Based on the
foregoing, and in light of the lack of any opposition, the Court finds that Plaintiff
has demonstrated grounds for
an order compelling the deposition of Lee. 
Lastly, Plaintiff seeks sanctions “jointly and
severally in the amount of $3,375.00 against Defendant SUK JOO LEE and defense
counsel, Haewon Kim, Esq.” (Notice of Mot. at p. 1:27-28.) In support of Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions, Plaintiff cites to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (h), which provides that “[m]isuses
of the discovery process include, but are not limited to, the following:…(h) Making
or opposing, unsuccessfully and without substantial justification, a motion to
compel or to limit discovery.” Plaintiff notes that pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision (a),
“[t]he court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the
misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both
pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a
result of that conduct.” 
However, the Court notes that Lee does not oppose the
instant motion. Thus, the Court does not find that Plaintiff has shown that
monetary sanctions are warranted against Lee for “opposing, unsuccessfully and
without substantial justification, a motion to compel or to limit discovery.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (h).) Accordingly,
the Court denies Plaintiff’s request for sanctions. 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion for an order to compel the
deposition of Lee is granted. The Court
orders Lee to appear for deposition on
____________ at ____ a.m., at the following location:  _________________________________________.  
Plaintiff’s request for
sanctions is denied. 
Plaintiff is ordered to provide notice of
this Order.
