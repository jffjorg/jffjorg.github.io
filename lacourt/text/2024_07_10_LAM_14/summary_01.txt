The judge has granted the defendants' petition to confirm the arbitration award, which was issued in favor of the defendants. The petition was served on the plaintiff, who did not oppose it, and therefore the allegations in the petition are deemed admitted. The arbitration award was made by Judge David H. Brickner (Ret.) and found that each side shall bear its own costs and attorney's fees. The judge has confirmed the award as made, as required by California Code of Civil Procedure section 1286, since the petition meets the requirements of sections 1285 and 1285.4.
