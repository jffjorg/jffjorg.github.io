TENTATIVE
RULING
 



DEPT:


32




HEARING DATE:


February
  6, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


19STCV13960




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  to be Relieved as Counsel




MOVING PARTY:


Plaintiff Cynthia Shelton’s Counsel




OPPOSING PARTY:


None



 
BACKGROUND
 
            Plaintiff
Cynthia Shelton’s (Plaintiff) counsel
of record, James D. Roberts (Counsel), moves to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff.
Counsel contends relief is necessary because there has been a breakdown in attorney-client
communication. 
 
            No
opposition has been filed for this motion. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
To be granted relief as counsel, counsel must comply with California
Rules of Court (CRC) 3.1362. Even where grounds for termination exist,
attorneys seeking to withdraw must comply with the procedures set forth in
California Rule of Professional Conduct (CRPC) 3.700 and are subject to
discipline for failure to do so. CRPC 3.700(B) lists various grounds for
mandatory withdrawal. 
 
An attorney's right to terminate the attorney-client relationship and
withdraw from a case is not absolute. (See Vann v. Shilleh (1975) 54
Cal.App.3d 192, 197; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398.) The
decision whether to grant or deny an application for withdrawal is within the
court's discretion, and it does not abuse that discretion by denying the
application on the ground that the attorney's withdrawal would work injustice
upon a third party. (Hodcarriers, Bldg. and Common Laborers Local Union No.
89 v. Miller (1966) 243 Cal.App.2d 391.)
 
The rules have been liberally construed to protect clients. (Vann
v. Shilleh, supra, 54 Cal.App.3d 192.) An attorney, either with client's
consent or court's approval, may withdraw from a case when withdrawal can be
accomplished without undue prejudice to client's interests; however, an
attorney “shall not withdraw from employment until the member has taken
reasonable steps to avoid reasonably foreseeable prejudice to the rights of the
client, including giving due notice to the client, allowing time for employment
of other counsel, complying with rule 3-700(D), and complying with applicable
laws and rules.” (CRPC 3.700(A)(2).) A lawyer violates his or her ethical
mandate by abandoning a client (Pineda v. State Bar (1989) 49 Cal.3d
753, 758 759), or by withdrawing at a critical point and thereby prejudicing
the client’s case. (CRPC 3.700(A)(2); Vann v. Shilleh, supra.)
 
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Counsel has filed forms MC-051 and
MC-052 and has lodged with the Court a copy of the proposed order on form
MC-053 as required.  (Cal Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362.)  Counsel states the instant
motion is filed for the following reason: “Ethical considerations require
withdrawal; also, (B) there has been an irreconcilable breakdown in the
attorney-client relationship. Lastly, (C) the undersigned is facing an
imminent, necessary joint replacement surgery in the next 1-3 months, that will
likely require substantial physical recovery and rehabilitation for 3-6 months
thereafter. As such, my physical condition renders it difficult to carry out
the employment effectively at the risk of potential prejudice to the client if
withdrawal is not granted. Client has been informally notified of my need to
withdraw from representation due to each of the grounds cited for several
months prior to this motion. I have taken all available steps to minimize
potential prejudice to the client by withdrawal.” (MC-052.) This declaration suggests mandatory and permissive
withdrawals. (CRPC 1.16(a), (b)(4).) 
 
            The Court finds these are valid
reasons for withdrawal. Additionally, Counsel asserts that Defendants’ summary
judgment motions in February 2025 allow Plaintiff sufficient time to retain
counsel. Counsel has also provided information for all future proceedings in
this case.  
 
 
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS the motion to relieve
counsel.  
 
Counsel shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file
proofs of service of such.
