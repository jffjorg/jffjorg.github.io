And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to relieve counsel, James D. Roberts, for Plaintiff Cynthia Shelton. The motion is granted, allowing Counsel to withdraw from representation due to a breakdown in attorney-client communication, Counsel's physical condition, and the need for joint replacement surgery. The Court finds these are valid reasons for withdrawal and notes that Plaintiff will have sufficient time to retain new counsel for future proceedings, including Defendants' summary judgment motions in February 2025.
