And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the revised Petition to Approve Compromise of Pending Action of a Minor, Othaniel Molinar, age 3. The petition is denied without prejudice due to several issues. Firstly, the gross amount of the settlement is incorrectly stated as $550,000, when in fact it is $450,000. Secondly, the payment of medical expenses and attorney fees/costs is unclear, as the payments are to be made payable to Claimant's attorney and Department of Health Care Services, rather than directly to Petitioner. Finally, Petitioner failed to provide the attachment 8a(4) as requested. As a result, the Court denies the petition without prejudice, and Petitioner is instructed to give notice and file proof of service.
