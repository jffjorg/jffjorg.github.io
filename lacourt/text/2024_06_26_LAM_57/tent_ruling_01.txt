  Case Number:  20STCV22026    Hearing Date:   June 26, 2024    Dept:  57 The Court is granting the four discovery motions of Defendant Arnoldo Jaquez that are on calendar today.  Plaintiffs Michael Mann and Marilyn Craig will thus be required to provide further responses to the discovery requests that are the subjects of the four motions.   The Court also is awarding sanctions to Jaquez in the form of the attorney's fees and costs incurred in connection with the four motions, although the amount the Court is awarding in total is less than half of the amount he requested.  Because the Court is engaged in a jury trial today, the Court is continuing the hearing on the four motions to July 11, 2024. In advance of July 11, the Court will provide detailed written rulings explaining the basis for its decisions on the four motions that are on calendar todayFour additional discovery motions of Jaquez are on calendar the week of July 8.  The Court will consolidate those four motions to be heard on July 11, such that there will be 8 discovery motions on calendar that day.  The Court will provide written tentative rulings on those four motions as well.
