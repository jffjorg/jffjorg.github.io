The Judge has also awarded sanctions to Jaquez in the form of attorney's fees and costs incurred in connection with the four motions, although the amount awarded is less than half of what Jaquez requested. Due to the ongoing jury trial, the hearing on the four motions has been continued to July 11, 2024. The Judge will provide detailed written rulings explaining the basis for its decisions on the four motions before July 11. Additionally, four more discovery motions of Jaquez are pending and will be consolidated with the current four motions to be heard on July 11.
