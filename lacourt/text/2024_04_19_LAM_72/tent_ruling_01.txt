Background
 
This is an action for the recovery of attorney’s fees.
 
Plaintiff is a law firm. On July 15, 2021, Defendant
executed a written retainer agreement (the “Agreement”) pursuant to which
Defendant retained Plaintiff to represent Defendant in an unlawful detainer
action. Defendant agreed to pay Plaintiff for attorney’s fees and costs upon
receipt of invoice for services rendered and costs expended on Defendant’s
behalf. Under the Agreement, Defendant agreed to pay interest at the rate of 10
percent per annum on any unpaid attorney’s fees and costs not paid within 30 days
of the issuance of the invoice.
 
Plaintiff rendered legal services to Defendant from July
2021 through June 2022 and incurred costs.
 
In June 2022, Defendant failed to make payments then due and
has thereafter failed to pay attorney’s fees due under the Agreement.
 
Plaintiff filed this case on November 6, 2023, raising
claims for (1) breach of contract; (2) account stated; (3) services rendered;
and (4) quantum meruit.
 
Default was entered against Defendant on January 8, 2024.
 
Legal Standard
 
CCP § 585 permits entry of a judgment after a Defendant has
failed to timely answer after being properly served.  A party seeking judgment on the default by
the Court must file a Form CIV-100 Request for Court Judgment, and: 
 
(1) Proof of service of the complaint and summons;
(2) A dismissal of
all parties against whom judgment is not sought (including Doe defendants) or
an application for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment (CRC 3.1800(a)(7));
(3) A declaration
of non-military status as to the defendant (typically included in Form CIV-100)
(CRC 3.1800(a)(5));
(4) A brief summary of the case (CRC 3.1800(a)(1)); 
(5) Admissible
evidence supporting a prima facie case for the damages or other relief
requested (Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999)
72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361-362); 
(6) Interest computations as necessary (CRC 3.1800(a)(3)); 
(7) A memorandum of
costs and disbursements (typically included in Form CIV-100 (CRC 3.1800(a)(4));

(8) A request for
attorney’s fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties (CRC
3.1800(a)(9)), accompanied by a declaration stating that the fees were
calculated in accordance with the fee schedule as per Local Rule 3.214.  Where a request for attorney fees is based on
a contractual provision the specific provision must be cited; (Local Rule
3.207); and
(9) A proposed form
of judgment (CRC 3.1800(a)(6));
(10) Where an
application for default judgment is based upon a written obligation to pay
money, the original written agreement should be submitted for cancellation (CRC
3.1806). A trial court may exercise its discretion to accept a copy where the
original document was lost or destroyed by ordering the clerk to cancel the
copy instead (Kahn v. Lasorda's Dugout, Inc. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th
1118, 1124);
(11) Where the
plaintiff seeks damages for personal injury or wrongful death, they must serve
a statement of damages on the defendant in the same manner as a summons (Code
Civ. Proc. § 425.11, subd. (c), (d)).
 
 
(California Rules
of Court rule 3.1800.)
 
Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(a)(1), items are
allowable as costs under Section 1032 if they are “filing, motion, and jury
fees.”
 
A party who defaults only admits facts well pleaded in the
complaint or cross-complaint.  (Molen
v. Friedman (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1149, 1153-1154.)  Thus, the complaint must state a claim for
the requested relief.
             
 
Discussion
 
Service of the Complaint and Summons
 
            According
to the proof of service filed on January 8, 2024, Defendant was served on December
5, 2023 at 330 N Brand Blvd, Ste 700, Glendale, CA 91203, by personal service
on Daisy Montenegro, Defendant’s authorized agent for service of process.
 
Dismissal of Other Parties
 
The Doe defendants were dismissed from the action on January
18, 2024, pursuant to Plaintiff’s request.
 
 
Non-Military Status
 
Lane Nussbaum avers to Defendant’s non-military status.
 
 
Summary of the Case
 
Plaintiff provides a brief summary of the case in the
Declaration of Lane Nussbaum. Plaintiff adequately pleads its causes of action
in the Complaint.
 
 
Evidence of Damages
 
“Code of Civil Procedure section 580 prohibits the entry of
a default judgment in an amount in excess of that demanded in the complaint.”  (Kim v. Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011)
201 Cal.App.4th 267, 286.) Moreover, “a statement of damages cannot be relied
upon to establish a plaintiff's monetary damages, except in cases of personal
injury or wrongful death.” (Ibid.) “In all other cases, when recovering
damages in a default judgment, the plaintiff is limited to the damages
specified in the complaint.” (Ibid.)
 
The Complaint requests $35,498.31 in damages. 
 
Lane Nussbaum avers that Plaintiff owes a principal amount
of $35,498.31. (Decl. Nussbaum, ¶ 7, Ex. 2.)
 
 
Interest
 
The Complaint requests prejudgment interest beginning on
October 12, 2023. The Agreement provides for interest in the amount of 10
percent per annum, which begins to accrue 30 days after each invoice is
received.
 
Lane Nussbaum avers that $1,449.11 in interest accrued since
the filing of this case. (Decl. Nussbaum Re Interest.)
 
 
Memorandum of Costs and Disbursements
 
Plaintiff includes a memorandum of costs in the submitted
Form CIV-100, averring that it expended $642.50 in costs.
 
 
Attorney’s Fees
 
            Plaintiff
does not request attorney’s fees.
 
 
Proposed Form of Judgment
 
            Plaintiff
has submitted a proposed form of judgment consistent with the foregoing.
 
 
Submission of the Written Agreement
 
            California
Rule of Court 3.1806 states that “unless otherwise ordered” judgment upon a
written obligation to pay money requires a clerk’s note across the face of the
writing that there has been a judgment. Here, Plaintiff has not submitted the
original documents. The Court does not discern any practical need for such a
clerk’s note on the written obligation in the current case and therefore orders
that it need not be included. If this causes any issues for any party or
non-party they are authorized to bring the matter to the Court’s
attention.  
 
 
Statement of Damages
 
Plaintiff does not need to submit a statement of damages
because this is not a personal injury or wrongful death case.
