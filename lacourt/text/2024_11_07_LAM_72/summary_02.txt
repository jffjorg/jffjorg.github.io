And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Appriza Pay LLC v. Sigue Corporation, et al. The case involves a dispute over a commercial contract and allegations of fraud. The defendant, Victor Cohen Arazi, had demurred to the second claim of the First Amended Complaint, which alleged fraud and breach of contract. The judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that Appriza has adequately pled both the representations made by Cohen and the reliance on those representations by Appriza.

The judge found that Appriza has pled sufficient facts to state a cause of action for fraud, including the alleged false representations made by Cohen, the knowledge of those falsities, and the justifiable reliance on those representations by Appriza. The judge also found that Appriza has identified its damages, including the cash advances made by Appriza after December 7, 2023, and has alleged that Sigue never repaid Appriza.

The judge's ruling is tentative, meaning that it is subject to revision or reconsideration based on further argument or evidence presented at the hearing.
