## English Summary:

The tentative ruling in this case grants the Receiver's motion to disburse $100,000 in escrow funds.  

Victoria Green initially agreed to purchase a property in Inglewood, CA. When she failed to complete the purchase, the Receiver, appointed by the court, was allowed to keep her deposit as liquidated damages. Green then assigned her rights to Anonymity Assets, LLC. Anonymity also failed to complete the purchase by the agreed-upon deadline.  

Anonymity argues that the court lacks jurisdiction over Fidelity Title (the escrow company) and itself, and that the Receiver caused the sale to fail by withholding necessary documents. The court rejects these arguments, finding that the transaction is directly connected to California and Anonymity's actions demonstrate a purposeful engagement with the California court system.  


The court concludes that the Receiver is entitled to the $100,000 deposit and grants the motion.

However, the Judge found that Anonymity's opposition was not prejudiced by the lack of service, and that the Court has jurisdiction over Fidelity Title and Anonymity. The Judge also found that Anonymity failed to specify what documents were needed to close the sale and failed to tender the full purchase price by the deadline. The motion was granted, and the Receiver is ordered to serve and lodge a proposed order for the Court's signature.
