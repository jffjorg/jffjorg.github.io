And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the Receiver's motion to disburse escrow agreement funds with respect to the failed sale of the Manchester Blvd property. The Receiver is entitled to the $100,000 non-refundable deposit made by Anonymity Assets, LLC, as Green failed to complete the purchase and Anonymity failed to pay the full purchase price by the deadline. Despite Anonymity's objections, the Court finds that the Receiver's jurisdiction over Fidelity Title and Anonymity is fair and that the Receiver is entitled to the deposit. The Receiver is ordered to serve and lodge a proposed order for the Court's signature within two court days.
