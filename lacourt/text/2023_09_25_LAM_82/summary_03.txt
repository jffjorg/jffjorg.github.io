## English Summary:

The tentative ruling in this case grants the Receiver's motion to disburse $100,000 in escrow funds.  

Victoria Green initially agreed to purchase a property in Inglewood, CA. When she failed to complete the purchase, the Receiver, appointed by the court, was allowed to keep her deposit as liquidated damages. Green then assigned her rights to Anonymity Assets, LLC. Anonymity also failed to complete the purchase by the agreed-upon deadline.  

Anonymity argues that the court lacks jurisdiction over Fidelity Title (the escrow company) and itself, and that the Receiver caused the sale to fail by withholding necessary documents. The court rejects these arguments, finding that the transaction is directly connected to California and Anonymity's actions demonstrate a purposeful engagement with the California court system.  


The court concludes that the Receiver is entitled to the $100,000 deposit and grants the motion.

## English Summary:

The judge is recommending to grant the Receiver's motion to release the $100,000 deposit held in escrow. 

Victoria Green initially agreed to purchase a property in Inglewood, California, but later assigned her rights to Anonymity Assets, LLC.  Anonymity failed to complete the purchase by the agreed-upon deadline, leading the Receiver to seek the deposit as liquidated damages. 

Anonymity argued that the sale fell through because the Receiver did not provide necessary documents and that the Court lacked jurisdiction over Fidelity Title (the escrow agent) and Anonymity. However, the judge found these arguments unconvincing and determined that the Receiver is entitled to the deposit based on the terms of the purchase agreement and a previous court order.
