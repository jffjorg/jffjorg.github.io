## English Summary

The judge is reviewing a case concerning construction supervision. The judge notes that the relevant legal standard is not crucial because the evidence presented to the board was strong enough. 

The judge addresses two key arguments:

1. **RENNEKER's Supervision:** The petitioner claims RENNEKER provided supervision but doesn't provide specific evidence from the administrative record. 
2. **Hearsay:** The petitioner argues that homeowner's testimony about Schlessinger bringing workers to the construction site is hearsay. The judge disagrees, stating that the homeowner's testimony is based on personal observation, not an out-of-court statement.

Based on the evidence, the judge believes the homeowner's testimony is credible.

**Summary of Tentative Ruling**

The Judge's tentative ruling is based on the evidence presented in a previous administrative record. The Judge notes that the decision regarding the standard of review is inconsequential, as the evidence before the Board was sufficient to meet the higher burden of clear and convincing evidence.

The Judge clarifies that all statutory references are to the Business and Professions Code, unless otherwise stated. The Judge also notes that Petitioner's claim that Renneker provided supervision or management services in connection with the 12th Avenue or Laguna Beach projects lacks supporting evidence in the administrative record.

The Judge further clarifies that the homeowner's testimony regarding Schlessinger bringing workers to the 12th Avenue property and going twice with the homeowner to Home Depot is not hearsay, as it is not an out-of-court statement. The Judge also finds no reason to doubt the credibility of the homeowner's testimony concerning these facts.

The Judge applies the California Code of Regulations, title 16, section 823 in effect at the time of the project, which provides examples of direct supervision and control. The relevant statutory period is from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2021.
