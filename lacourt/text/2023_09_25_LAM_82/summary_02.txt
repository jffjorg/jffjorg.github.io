And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's ruling addresses the sufficiency of evidence presented to the Board in a case involving a licensee's qualifier. The judge notes that the applicable standard of review is inconsequential in this case, as the evidence is sufficient to meet the higher burden of clear and convincing evidence. The judge also addresses the petitioner's contention that the assertions made by the homeowner are impermissible hearsay, finding that they are not hearsay because they are based on personal observations and not out-of-court statements. The judge also notes that the evidence shows that the licensee's qualifier was responsible for exercising direct supervision and control over the construction operations, as required by section 7068.1 of the Business and Professions Code. Overall, the judge's ruling supports the conclusion that the evidence presented to the Board was sufficient to support the findings made.
