The judge also notes that the evidence shows that the licensee's qualifier was responsible for exercising direct supervision and control over the construction operations, as required by section 7068.1 of the Business and Professions Code. Overall, the judge's ruling supports the conclusion that the evidence presented to the Board was sufficient to support the findings made.

## English Summary

The judge is reviewing a case concerning construction supervision. The judge notes that the relevant legal standard is not crucial because the evidence presented to the board was strong enough. 

The judge addresses two key arguments:

1. **RENNEKER's Supervision:** The petitioner claims RENNEKER provided supervision but doesn't provide specific evidence from the administrative record. 
2. **Hearsay:** The petitioner argues that homeowner's testimony about Schlessinger bringing workers to the construction site is hearsay. The judge disagrees, stating that the homeowner's testimony is based on personal observation, not an out-of-court statement.

Based on the evidence, the judge believes the homeowner's testimony is credible.

The Judge notes that the petitioner claims RENNEKER provided supervision or management services in connection with the 12th Avenue and Laguna Beach projects, but fails to provide supporting evidence. The Judge also addresses the petitioner's contention that certain assertions are impermissible hearsay, but finds that these assertions are not hearsay and are based on the homeowner's personal observations. The Judge applies the relevant laws and regulations, including Section 7068.1 of the Business and Professions Code and California Code of Regulations, title 16, section 823, to the case. The ruling cites relevant case law, including Acosta v. Glenfed Development Corp. and Suffolk Construction Company, Inc. v. Los Angeles Unified School District.
