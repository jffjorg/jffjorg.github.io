Case:               Ally Bank v. Kichon D. Williams (23STLC04410)
  
TENTATIVE
RULING:
 
The Unopposed Application for Writ of Possession by
plaintiff Ally Bank is DENIED. 
 
Under CCP § 512.030, prior to the hearing on an application
for a writ of possession, the defendant “shall be served” with specific
documents, including the Summons and Complaint, the Notice of Application and
Hearing, and a copy of the application and any affidavits. Plaintiff has
neither filed any proofs of service of the foregoing with the court nor
attached proofs of service to the filed document. Because plaintiff has failed
to provide proof of service as required, the application cannot be granted.
