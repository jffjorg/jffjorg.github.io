**Tentative Ruling Summary**

**Case Information:**

* Case Number: 21STCP02866
* Hearing Date: September 25, 2023
* Department: 82

**Parties:**

* Petitioner: Ray Alvin Renneker, dba California Construction Services
* Respondents: Contractors State License Board, et al.

**Issues:**

* Whether the Contractors State License Board (CSLB) properly revoked Petitioner's contractor's license due to his hiring of Jason Schlessinger, a revoked contractor, in a managerial capacity.
* Whether the CSLB abused its discretion in increasing the cost recovery order from $12,000 to $14,516.

**Findings:**

* The evidence demonstrates that Schlessinger played a managerial and supervisorial role in Petitioner's business, including determining project progression, arranging for workers, and resolving a small claims action on behalf of CCS.
* Petitioner's argument that Schlessinger was not a supervisory employee is unpersuasive, as the evidence shows that Schlessinger had a significant level of control over the projects.
* The CSLB's decision to revoke Petitioner's license is supported by the weight of the evidence.

**Ruling:**

* The petition for writ of mandate is granted in part. The Court will direct the CSLB to amend its order so that the cost award will be $12,000, as ordered by the Administrative Law Judge.
* The petition is otherwise denied.

**Key Statutes:**

* Business and Professions Code ยง 7121
* Government Code ยง 11517
* 16 C.C.R. ยง 317.5
* Section 125.3
