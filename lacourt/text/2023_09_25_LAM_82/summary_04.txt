## English Summary

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Ally Bank's application for a writ of possession against Kichon D. Williams.  

The judge states that under California Code of Civil Procedure § 512.030, Ally Bank was required to provide Kichon D. Williams with specific documents, including the Summons and Complaint, Notice of Application and Hearing, the application itself, and any supporting affidavits.  However, Ally Bank failed to file any proof of service showing that these documents were delivered to the defendant.  

Because Ally Bank did not properly serve Kichon D. Williams, the judge cannot grant the application for a writ of possession.

Despite the application being unopposed, the judge has denied it because Ally Bank failed to provide proof of service of the required documents to Kichon D. Williams. According to California Code of Civil Procedure section 512.030, the defendant must be served with specific documents, including the Summons and Complaint, the Notice of Application and Hearing, and a copy of the application and any affidavits, before the hearing on the application for a writ of possession. Since Ally Bank did not file any proofs of service or attach them to the filed document, the judge has denied the application.
