[1]           The Court notes that its decision
regarding the applicable standard of review is ultimately inconsequential here,
as the Court finds that the evidence before the Board was sufficient to meet
the higher burden of clear and convincing evidence.


[2]           All statutory references are to the
Business and Professions Code, unless otherwise stated.


[3]           Petitioner also states in conclusory
fashion that “[t]here is plenty of evidence which shows that RENNEKER actually
provided supervision or management services in connection with the 12th Avenue
project or the Laguna Beach project.” (Reply at 9.)  Petitioner does not cite any other supporting
evidence in the administrative record to back up this claim.


[4]
          When
the Accusation was filed on June 14, 2019 (AR 888), section 7068.1 stated a
licensee’s qualifier “shall be responsible for exercising that direct
supervision and control of his or her employer’s or principal’s construction
operations.” (§ 7068.1(a), effective January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2021.)
California Code of Regulations, title 16, section 823, in turn, provided
examples of direct supervision and control. (See Acosta v. Glenfed
Development Corp. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1278, 1299.)  16 C.C.R. § 823 was repealed on June 2,
2022, but the Court applies the regulation in effect at the time of the
project. (See Suffolk Construction Company, Inc. v. Los Angeles Unified
School District (2023) 90 Cal.App.5th 849, 878.)
 


[5]
          Petitioner
also contends the assertions that Schlessinger brought workers to the 12th
Avenue property and that Schlessinger went twice with the homeowner to Home
Depot to do so is impermissible hearsay. (Reply at 10:12-13.) First, these
assertions are not hearsay, because they are not out-of-court statements.
(Evid. Code § 1200.) Second, the homeowner attested to these facts based on his
personal observations. (AR  99, 1138.)
The Court has no reason to doubt the credibility of the homeowner concerning these
facts.
