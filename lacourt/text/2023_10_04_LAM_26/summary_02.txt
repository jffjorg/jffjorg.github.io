## Tentative Ruling Summary: Art G. Garcia v. DWWVF, Inc., et al.

**Case Number:** 23STCV04944

**Hearing Date:** October 4, 2023

**Judge:** Elaine Lu

**People Involved:**

* **Plaintiff:** Art G. Garcia
* **Defendants:** 
    * DWWVF, Inc. dba David Wilsons Villa Ford
    * Ford Motor Company

**Key Facts:**

* Plaintiff alleges breach of warranty by Ford regarding a 2019 Ford Mustang.
* Plaintiff alleges negligent repair by DWWVF, Inc. after bringing the car in for repairs.

**Legal Issues:**

* **Economic Loss Rule:** DWWVF argues the economic loss rule bars Plaintiff's negligent repair claim because it arises from the warranty contract between Plaintiff and Ford.

**Judge's Findings:**

* The economic loss rule does not apply because Plaintiff's claim against DWWVF is independent of the warranty contract. DWWVF was not a party to the warranty and Plaintiff's claim is based on DWWVF's alleged failure to meet industry standards while repairing the car.
* Plaintiff sufficiently alleges damages, even if not specifically detailed, meeting the liberal pleading standard in California.

**Ruling:**

* DWWVF's demurrer is **OVERRULED** on both grounds.
* DWWVF must file an answer by November 6, 2023.
* The case management conference is continued to November 8, 2023.

**Summary:**

The judge found that Plaintiff's claim against DWWVF for negligent repair is not barred by the economic loss rule and that Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged damages. The case will proceed.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case 23STCV04944, involving a dispute between Art G. Garcia (Plaintiff) and DWWVF, Inc. dba David Wilsons Villa Ford, Ford Motor Company (Defendants). The Plaintiff filed a complaint against the Defendants on March 6, 2023, alleging two causes of action: (1) Violation of the Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty against Ford Motor Company, and (2) Negligent Repair against DWWVF.

The Defendants filed a demurrer to the complaint, which the Plaintiff opposed, and the Defendants replied. The judge has now considered the demurrer and has ruled that it is overruled.

Regarding the second cause of action, the judge held that the Economic Loss Rule is inapplicable to the Plaintiff's claims against DWWVF, as the claim arises from the Plaintiff bringing the Subject Vehicle to DWWVF and DWWVF's failure to comply with industry standards, rather than from a contract between the parties.

The judge also ruled that the Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged damages, despite not specifying the exact amount, as the complaint clearly specifies that the Plaintiff suffered damages as a result of DWWVF's claims, and California follows a notice pleading standard.

In conclusion, the judge has overruled the demurrer of Defendant DWWVF, Inc. dba David Wilsons Villa Ford, and ordered the Defendant to file an answer on or before November 6, 2023. The case management conference is continued to November 8, 2023 at 8:30 am.
