And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff's ex parte application to shorten time to hear their motion in limine. The judge believes that Plaintiff made a typographical error in their application and intended to state that they filed a motion in limine on September 29, 2023, not 2016. Even assuming this is correct, the judge found that Plaintiff did not actually file a motion in limine on that date, and there is no pending motion in limine to shorten time. However, if Plaintiff does file and serve their anticipated motion in limine on October 4, 2023, Defendant should respond with opposition no later than 7 court days later, and Plaintiff should file proof of service. The judge will hear the motion in limine prior to jury selection, but not necessarily at the final status conference.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's ex parte application to shorten the time to hear their motion in limine. The plaintiff claims to have filed a motion in limine on September 29, 2023, but the court's docket reveals that no such motion was filed. The judge presumes that the plaintiff made a typographical error and meant to say September 29, 2023, rather than 2016. However, even if the plaintiff had filed the motion on September 29, 2023, there is still no pending motion in limine to shorten time for. Therefore, the plaintiff's ex parte application is denied without prejudice. The judge instructs the plaintiff to file and serve their anticipated motion in limine, and the defendant to file and serve any opposition within 7 court days. The court will hear the motion in limine before jury selection, but not necessarily at the final status conference. The plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this order and file proof of service.

Summary:
---

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling for a future court hearing in case number 21STCV32861. The hearing is scheduled for October 4, 2023, in Department 26.

The Judge has considered Plaintiff's ex parte application for an order shortening time to hear Plaintiff's motion in limine. However, the Judge notes that there is no pending motion in limine for which to shorten time. The Judge presumes that Plaintiff made a typographical error and meant to state that it filed a motion in limine on September 29, 2023, not 2016. However, the Judge notes that the Court's docket reveals that Plaintiff did not file any motion in limine on September 29, 2023.

Therefore, Plaintiff's ex parte application is denied without prejudice.

In any event, if Plaintiff files and serves its anticipated motion in limine on October 4, 2023, Defendant should file and serve any opposition no later than 7 court days following service of Plaintiff's motion in limine, and any reply must be filed and served no later than 5 court days prior to the final status conference. The Court will hear Plaintiff's motion in limine prior to the commencement of jury selection, but not necessarily at the final status conference.

Plaintiff is required to give notice of this order and to file proof of service of such.
