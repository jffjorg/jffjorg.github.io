```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff's ex parte application to shorten time to hear their motion in limine. The judge believes that Plaintiff made a typographical error in their application and intended to state that they filed a motion in limine on September 29, 2023, not 2016. Even assuming this is correct, the judge found that Plaintiff did not actually file a motion in limine on that date, and there is no pending motion in limine to shorten time. However, if Plaintiff does file and serve their anticipated motion in limine on October 4, 2023, Defendant should respond with opposition no later than 7 court days later, and Plaintiff should file proof of service. The judge will hear the motion in limine prior to jury selection, but not necessarily at the final status conference.
