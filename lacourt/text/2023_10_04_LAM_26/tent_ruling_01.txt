  Case Number:  21STCV32861    Hearing Date:   October 4, 2023    Dept:  26 On October 3, 2023, Plaintiff filed an ex parte application for an order shortening time to hear Plaintiff's motion in limine.  Throughout its ex parte application, Plaintiff asserts that "Plaintiff filed and served a Motion in Limine for adverse inference instructions on September 29, 2016 [sic], with sufficient statutory notice under CCP Section 1005 so that it may be heard no later than the date of the FSC."  The Court will presume that Plaintiff has made a typographical error and that Plaintiff actually meant to state that it filed a motion in limine on September 29, 2023 -- not 2016.  In any event, even presuming that Plaintiff meant September 29, 2023, Plainiff is mistaken.  A review of the Court's (electronic) docket reveals that Plaintiff did not in fact file any motion in lmine on September 29, 2023.  Indeed the docket reflects no motion in limine filed by any party to date.  Thus, there is no pending motion in limine for which to shorten time.  Accordingly, Plaintiff's ex parte application is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
 
In any event, if Plaintiff files and serves its antiipated motion in limine on October 4, 2023, Defendant should file and serve any opposition no later than 7 court days following service of Plaintiff's motion in limine, and any reply must be filed and served no later than 5 court days prior to the final status conference.  The Court will hear Plaintiff's motion in limine prior to the commencement of jury selection, but not necessarily at the FSC.
 
Plaintiff to give notice of this order and to file proof of service of such.
