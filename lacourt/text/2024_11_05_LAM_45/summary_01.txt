And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by Defendant Madlen Manoukian to the complaint filed by Plaintiffs Ravand Construction, Inc. and Hassan Mohammadkhanighiy Asvand is sustained with leave to amend. The judge found that the allegations in the complaint are insufficient and uncertain as to Defendant Madlen because they fail to provide her with notice of the basis for her liability. The judge also found that the complaint is uncertain or ambiguous as to Defendant Madlen because the express allegations of the complaint limit the effect of the allegations and do not properly impute liability to her. The judge gave the plaintiffs leave to amend the complaint to cure the defects and provide a reasonable basis for establishing liability against Defendant Madlen.
