Background
            On
July 1, 2024, Plaintiff Universal Bank (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint in
Interpleader against Defendants Idabel Guzman Domantay (“Domantay”), Kemar
Porteous (“Porteous”), Shannon Griffith (“Griffith”), Neville Lewis (“Lewis”),
Monique Maniquiz Busby (“Busby”), Lydia Rigor (“Rigor”), and Adult Protective
Services of Los Angeles County (“APS”) (collectively, “Defendants”).  
            Plaintiff alleges that it is a Federal
Savings Bank that holds an account for Defendant Domantay. (Complaint, ¶ 1.)
Defendant Domantay is the account holder and is a victim of elder financial
abuse. (Complaint, ¶ 2.) Defendants Porteous, Griffith, and Lewis were all
recipients of cashier’s checks from Defendant Domantay’s account. (Complaint,
¶¶ 3-5.) Defendant Busby is the niece of Defendant Domantay. (Complaint, ¶ 6.)
Defendant Rigor is the sister-in-law of Defendant Domantay. (Complaint, ¶ 7.) A
dispute has arisen between the Defendants with respect to the funds in the
account. (Complaint, ¶ 9.) Plaintiff is holding the sum of $198,151.51 in
Defendant Domantay’s account, as of June 25, 2024. (Complaint, ¶ 10.) Plaintiff
cannot resolve the conflicting demands and, therefore, is unable to determine
to whom the $198,151.51 should rightfully be delivered. (Complaint, ¶ 12.)
Plaintiff alleges that it has no interest in the funds except for attorneys’
fees and expenses incurred in filing the complaint. (Complaint, ¶ 13.) 
            On
September 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Order for Discharge and Payment
of Attorneys’ Fees and Costs, which was unopposed.
            On
September 26, 2024, pursuant to a request for dismissal filed by Plaintiff,
Defendant APS was dismissed from the complaint with prejudice. 
            On
October 3, 2024, after hearing, the Court denied Plaintiff’s Motion for Order
for Discharge and Payment of Attorneys’ Fees and Costs without prejudice. (See
10/03/24 Minute Order.) 
            On
October 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for Order for Discharge and
Payment of Attorneys’ Fees and Costs.  
            As
of October 24, 2024, the motion is unopposed. Any opposition was required to
have been filed and served at least nine court days prior to the hearing. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) 
Legal
Standard
An interpleader
action is initiated when a party, who has no interest in the disputed funds or
property but is subject to conflicting claims, deposits those funds or property
with the court and seeks to compel the claimants to litigate their claims among
themselves. (Tri-State, Inc. v. Long Beach Community College Dist. (2012)
204 Cal.App.4th 224, 227 (Tri-State).) This is done to prevent multiple
lawsuits and double vexation. (Principal Life Ins. Co. v. Peterson (2007)
156 Cal.App.4th 676, 682.) 
The interpleader
process involves a two-step procedure. (City of Morgan Hill v. Brown (1999)
71 Cal.App.4th 1114, 1126 (Morgan Hill).) The court first determines
whether the plaintiff has the right to interplead the funds or property. (Id.
at p. 1126-27.)  “[I]f that right is
sustained, an interlocutory decree is entered with requires the defendants to
interplead and litigate their claims to the funds.” (Virtanen v. O’Connell (2006)
140 Cal.App.4th 688, 698.) “Second, it if it is so determined, then the court
will discharge the plaintiff from liability and the action may proceed for the
determination of the rights of the various claimants to the property which is
then in the custody of the court.” (Morgan Hill, supra, 71
Cal.App.4th 1114 at p. 1127.) “The effect of such an order is to preserve the
fund, discharge the stakeholder from further liability, and to keep the fund in
the court’s custody until the rights of the potential claimants of the monies
can be adjudicated.” (Virtanen v. O’Connell, supra, 140 Cal.App.4th
688 at p. 698.) 
“Where the only
relief sought against one of the defendants is the payment of a stated amount
of money alleged to be wrongfully withheld, such defendant may, upon affidavit
that he is a mere stakeholder with no interest in the amount or any portion
thereof and that conflicting demands have been made upon him for the amount by
parties to the action, upon notice to such parties, apply to the court for an
order discharging him from liability and dismissing him from the action on his
depositing with the clerk of the court the amount in dispute and the court may,
in its discretion, make such order.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 386.5.) An
interpleader plaintiff must follow all requirements of Code of Civil Procedure
sections 386 and 386.5. (Hood v. Gonzales (2019) 43 Cal.App.5th 57,
81-82.) 
 
 
 
Discussion 
            Discharge from Interpleader Action
            Plaintiff
has met the statutory requirements to be released from the current interpleader
action. Plaintiff has a right to interplead pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 386. (See CCP § 386(b) (“Any person, firm, corporation, association or
other entity against whom double or multiple claims are made, or may be made,
by two or more persons which are such that they may give rise to double or
multiple liability, may bring an action against the claimants to compel them to
interplead and litigate their several claims.”).) Plaintiff has established no
interest in the funds. (Complaint, ¶ 13.) Plaintiff has also deposited the
disputed funds under Code of Civil Procedure section 386(c). (Complaint, ¶ 13.)

Plaintiff has
named all defendants in this action in its complaint and served Defendants
Domantay, Busby, and Rigor. (Mot. for Discharge, Proof of Service.) However,
Plaintiff has not served Defendants Porteous, Griffith, or Lewis with either
the complaint or the instant motion. Plaintiff alleges that it does not have
sufficient information to have them served. (Mot. for Discharge, p. 4.) Plaintiff’s
counsel, Anthony Rothman (“Rothman”), declares that on October 7, 2024, a
request for dismissal was filed for Defendants Porteous, Griffith, and Lewis.
(Rothman Decl., ¶ 4.) Such defendants were perpetrators of the elder abuse
Defendant Domantay. (Rothman Decl., ¶ 4.) Mr. Rothman states that “[t]heir
addresses and whereabouts are unknown, and were unable to be uncovered by an
attorney service. It was determined the best course of action was to dismiss
these parties.” (Rothman Decl., ¶ 4.) 
Based on a
review of the register of actions in this matter, the Court notes that
dismissal was not entered as to Defendants Porteous, Griffith, and Lewis. The
lack of dismissal was due to errors on the request for dismissal form. It
follows that Defendants Porteous, Griffith, and Lewis are still parties to this
action. As such, those defendants are entitled to notice of this action and the
instant motion. “[D]ue process requires a party be fully advised of the issues
to be addressed and be given adequate notice of what facts it must rebut in
order to prevail.” (Fenn v. Sherriff (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 1466, 1481.)

            As
such, the Court DENIES Plaintiff’s motion for discharge from liability without
prejudice. 
            Attorneys’ Fees and Costs
            “A
party to an action who follows the procedure set forth in Section 386 or 386.5
may insert in his motion, petition, complaint, or cross complaint a request for
allowance of his costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred in such action.”
(CCP § 386.6(a).) “In ordering the discharge of such party, the court may, in
its discretion, award such party his costs and reasonable attorney fees from
the amount in dispute which has been deposited with the court.” (CCP §
386.6(a).)
            Mr.
Rothman states that his hourly rate is $460.00 per hour and that he “will have
billed 21 hours, including drafting the new version of this motion.” (Rothman
Decl., ¶ 3.) Plaintiff is requesting $10,385.00 in fees and costs. (Mot. for
Discharge, p. 5.) Given that Plaintiff cannot be discharged at this time due to
the lack of service on all interested parties, the Court finds that it is
inappropriate to award Plaintiff its fees and costs at this time under CCP §
386.6(a).
            The
Court therefore DENIES Plaintiff’s request for attorneys’ fees and costs
without prejudice.    
It is so
ordered.
