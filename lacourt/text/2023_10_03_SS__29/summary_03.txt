```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Robert Joiner's motion to set aside the dismissal of his complaint without prejudice. The plaintiff had filed a complaint against Defendant Terrence Lloyd Hutchinson alleging negligence following a motor vehicle collision in 2019. The court had dismissed the complaint without prejudice in 2022 when the plaintiff did not appear for Non-Jury Trial.

The plaintiff then filed a motion to set aside the dismissal, citing Code of Civil Procedure sections 1008 and 473(b). The judge found that the motion was untimely, as it was filed more than a year after the dismissal. The judge also found that the plaintiff did not demonstrate excusable neglect or a meritorious case.

However, the judge did not completely deny the motion. The judge denied the motion without prejudice, meaning that the plaintiff may file a new motion to set aside the dismissal on equitable grounds. The judge noted that the plaintiff would need to provide additional evidence to support his claim, including evidence of a meritorious case, a satisfactory excuse for not appearing at trial, and diligence in seeking to set aside the dismissal.

## English Summary:

The judge denied Plaintiff Robert Joiner's motion to set aside the dismissal of his negligence case against Defendant Terrence Lloyd Hutchinson. 

The court found the motion untimely under both legal provisions cited by the Plaintiff. While the Plaintiff claimed he was unable to attend trial due to a serious illness caused by COVID-19, his motion was filed over a year after the dismissal, exceeding the statutory time limits for relief.

However, the judge allowed the Plaintiff to file a new motion seeking relief on equitable grounds. This means the Plaintiff can attempt to argue that special circumstances outside the law warrant setting aside the dismissal. To succeed, he must prove he has a strong case, a valid reason for missing trial, and acted promptly upon discovering the dismissal.
