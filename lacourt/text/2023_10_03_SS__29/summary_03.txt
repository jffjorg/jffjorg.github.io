And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Robert Joiner's motion to set aside the dismissal of his complaint without prejudice. The plaintiff had filed a complaint against Defendant Terrence Lloyd Hutchinson alleging negligence following a motor vehicle collision in 2019. The court had dismissed the complaint without prejudice in 2022 when the plaintiff did not appear for Non-Jury Trial.

The plaintiff then filed a motion to set aside the dismissal, citing Code of Civil Procedure sections 1008 and 473(b). The judge found that the motion was untimely, as it was filed more than a year after the dismissal. The judge also found that the plaintiff did not demonstrate excusable neglect or a meritorious case.

However, the judge did not completely deny the motion. The judge denied the motion without prejudice, meaning that the plaintiff may file a new motion to set aside the dismissal on equitable grounds. The judge noted that the plaintiff would need to provide additional evidence to support his claim, including evidence of a meritorious case, a satisfactory excuse for not appearing at trial, and diligence in seeking to set aside the dismissal.
