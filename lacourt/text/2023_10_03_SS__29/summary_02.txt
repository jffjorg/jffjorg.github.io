The judge notes that the defendant's responses were served one court day late and consisted only of objections, which are waived under the statute. The judge awards sanctions in the amount of $750, calculated as 1.5 hours of reasonable attorney time for the motion, multiplied by counsel's reasonable billing rate of $500 per hour.

## English Summary

The Judge has made a tentative ruling in favor of the Plaintiff, Iuliia Platokhina Wright, in her motion to have certain facts deemed admitted in her lawsuit against Philip Spencer Wright.  The Judge finds that Defendant's failure to timely respond to Plaintiff's Requests for Admission (RFAs) was a misuse of the discovery process. The Judge will therefore grant Plaintiff's request to deem the truth of the matters in the RFAs admitted.

The Judge will also grant Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions against Defendant and his attorney. However, the Judge has reduced Plaintiff's requested $10,000 sanctions to $750, finding that Plaintiff's filings were unnecessarily extensive for this type of motion.
