And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion for a deemed-admitted order, deeming the truth of the matters specified in the plaintiff's Requests for Admission (Set One) as admitted. The judge also grants the plaintiff's request for sanctions in part, ordering the defendant and their counsel to pay $750 in monetary sanctions for failing to serve a timely response to the Requests for Admission. The judge notes that the defendant's responses were served one court day late and consisted only of objections, which are waived under the statute. The judge awards sanctions in the amount of $750, calculated as 1.5 hours of reasonable attorney time for the motion, multiplied by counsel's reasonable billing rate of $500 per hour.
