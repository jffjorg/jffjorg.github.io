TENTATIVE
 
The Motion of Plaintiff
Iuliia Platokhina Wright for an Order Deeming the
Truth of the Matters Specified in her Request for Admissions, Set One, is
GRANTED. 
 
Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions is
GRANTED in part.
 
Background
On January 22, 2021, Plaintiff Iuliia Platokhina
Wright (“Plaintiff”) filed the complaint in this action against Defendant
Philip Spencer Wright (“Defendant”). More than two years later, on July 28,
2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (the “FAC”).  In the FAC, Plaintiff alleges the following
causes of action: (1) battery; (2) assault; (3) false imprisonment; (4)
intrusion of privacy; (5) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (6)
negligence; and (7) unlawful eviction. 
No answer has been filed, but Defendant has filed at
least one motion seeking affirmative relief.
The parties were previously married.  On April 2, 2019, Defendant filed a petition to
have the marriage annulled on the ground of fraud (Los Angeles Superior Court Case
No. 19STFL03890).  Plaintiff filed a
response to the petition seeking to dissolve the marriage.  The dissolution proceeding has been extraordinarily
contentious, with multiple requests for restraining orders, numerous appeals,
and an additional request for a restraining order between counsel (and a
successful appeal of that ruling). 
Judgment in the dissolution action was entered on September 20, 2021,
vacated on February 10, 2022, and a new judgment was entered on March 3, 2022
(with a nunc pro tunc date of September 20, 2021).  Pursuant to that judgment, the parties’
marriage was dissolved.  The judgment
states that the parties were married for only 18 days (from February 14 to
March 4, 2019).  The parties continue to engage
in extensive litigation of post-judgment matters in the family law case.
On September 13, 2023, Department 1 ruled that this civil
action and the family law action are not related cases within the meaning of California
Rule of Court, rule 3.300.
Numerous discovery motions are currently pending before
this Court.  
Set for hearing on October 3 is just one of these
motions, a motion by Plaintiff for an order deeming admitted the truth of matters
specified in Requests for Admission (Set One) (the “RFAs”) and seeking $10,000
in sanctions.
Plaintiff served the RFAs on Defendant’s counsel by
email on July 31, 2023.  (Volkov Decl., ¶ 2
& Exh. 1.)  As of the time of filing,
on September 5, 2023, no response had been received.  (Id., ¶ 3.)
On that same date, September 5, 2023, Defendant did serve
responses to the RFAs by FedEx overnight delivery.  (Aisen Decl., ¶ 3 & Exh. B.)  The responses consist only of objections.   (Id., Exh. B.)
Plaintiff filed her motion to deem admitted the truth
of the matters specified in the RFAs on September 5, 2023.  Defendant filed an opposition on September
19, 2023.  Plaintiff filed a reply on
September 26, 2023.
Legal
Standard
 
A party must respond to requests for admission within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests
for admission are directed does not provide a timely response, the propounding party
may move for an order that the truth of the matters specified in the requests
be deemed admitted. (Id., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time limit
for such a motion, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id.,
§ 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) 
The court “shall” make the order that the truth of the matters
specified in the request be deemed admitted unless the court “finds that the
party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before
the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission
that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Id., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St.
Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both,
whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated
this motion [to deem admitted the matters contained in the requests for
admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil
Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines
“[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery.” 
Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery
process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2023.030, subd. (a).)
Discussion 
 
Plaintiff served
the RFAs by email on July 31, 2023.  (Volkov
Decl., ¶ 2.)  Normally, responses are due
30 days after service.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) 
Thirty days after service was Wednesday,
August 30, 2023.
 
Because the RFAs
were served by email, Defendant, by statute, had two additional court days to
respond to the RFAs.  (Code Civ. Proc. §
1010.6., subd. (a)(3)(B).)  That means
that the responses were due on Friday, September 1, 2023.
 
Defendant did not
serve his responses on September 1. 
Instead, he served them one court day later, on Tuesday, September 5,
2023.  (Aisen Decl., ¶ 3 & Exh. B.)  (Monday, September 4, was a court holiday.)
 
The consequences
for failing to serve a timely response to RFAs are set forth in Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.280.
 
First, all objections
are waived.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subd. (a).)  The Court may
grant relief from this waiver, but the responding party must seek such relief
by motion and must make the showing required by statute.  (Ibid.)
 
Second, the
propounding party may move for an order deeming admitted the truth of all matters
specified in the RFAs.  (Id.,
subd. (b).)  The Legislature, using
mandatory language, has directed that the court “shall make this order, unless
it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed
has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Id., subd. (c).)  There is no exception in the statute, even
when responses were served only one court day late.
 
Here, Plaintiff has
moved for a deemed-admitted order, and Defendant has not served a response that
substantially complied with Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.220.  To the contrary, Defendant’s responses
consist entirely of objections – and those objections have been waived.  Accordingly, the Court is under a mandatory
obligation to GRANT Plaintiff’s request for a deemed-admitted order.  
 
Third, the
Legislature, again using mandatory language, has stated that when a party moves
for a deemed-admitted order, “It is mandatory that court impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 [of the Civil Discovery Act] on the party or attorney,
or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission
necessitated this motion.”  (Ibid.)  There is no exception to the mandatory
sanction language in section 2033.280, as there is in many other sanction provisions
of the Civil Discovery Act, for a party or attorney who acts with substantial
justification or where the imposition of sanctions would be unjust.  Accordingly, the Court is under a mandatory
obligation to GRANT Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions under the Civil
Discovery Act.
 
As to the amount
of sanctions, however, the Court must limit the sanction to the amount of “reasonable
expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of [the
sanctionable] conduct.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).)  Plaintiff
requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $10,000, but that is far beyond
what is reasonable.
 
A motion for a
deemed-admitted order, when the opposing counsel has not timely served responses,
is a simple motion.  All that needs to be
shown is that RFAs were properly served and no response was received within the
statutory time period.  Plaintiff’s
filings (a 15-page brief, a 99-paragraph declaration, and more than 60 pages of
exhibits) far exceed what is reasonable and necessary for Plaintiff’s
motion.  (The Court also notes that
where, as here, a party is filing multiple, parallel discovery motions, the
work required can be divided among the motions.)
 
Accordingly, the
Court awards sanctions in the amount of $750, calculated as 1.5 hours of
reasonable attorney time for this motion, multiplied by counsel’s reasonable
billing rate of $500 per hour.
 
Conclusion 
 
The Court GRANTS
Plaintiff’s motion for a deemed-admitted order. 
The truth of the matters specified in Plaintiff’s Requests for Admission
(Set One) are deemed admitted.
 
The Court GRANTS
in part Plaintiff’s request for sanctions. 
Defendant and counsel of record the Law Office of Jacquelynn L. Hansen,
APC are ORDERED, jointly and severally, to pay monetary sanctions to Plaintiff
under the Civil Discovery Act in the amount of $750 within 30 days of notice of
this order.
 
Moving party is
ORDERED to give notice.
