  Case Number:  21STCV02403    Hearing Date:   October 3, 2023    Dept:  29 TENTATIVE
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s two
motions to compel.
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s
motion to deem admitted the matters specified in Requests for Admission.
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s request for monetary
sanctions in part. 
 
Background 
 
This case
arises out of a motor vehicle accident that allegedly occurred on April 21,
2019, near the intersection of York Boulevard and Vista Drive in Los Angeles,
California.  
 
On January
21, 2021, Plaintiff Lindsey Esquivel (“Esquivel”) and Sally Ydelbira Tipple (“Tipple”)
filed a complaint against Defendant Jeanine Rohn (“Defendant”) and Does 1
through 100 alleging causes of action for (1) motor vehicle negligence and (2)
general negligence.  Defendant filed her
answer on September 7, 2022. 
On May 17, 2023,
Defendant filed multiple motions to compel initial responses to discovery.  Before the Court at this time are three of
those motions: (1) Defendant’s motion to compel Tipple to provide initial
responses to Special Interrogatories (Set One); (2) Defendant’s motion to
compel Tipple to provide initial responses to Form Interrogatories (Set One);
and (3) Defendant’s motion for an order deeming admitted the truth of the
matters specified in Requests for Admission (Set One) served on Esquivel.  Defendant also seeks monetary sanctions in each
motion.
Plaintiff has not filed
any opposition.
The Court is aware that three
motions to compel were heard in this case on October 2 and that two additional
discovery motions are scheduled for October 4.
Legal Standard
 
A party must
respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd.
(b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no
meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition,
a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves
to compel initial responses to interrogatories, “the court shall impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (c).)
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
that the truth of the matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted. (Id.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for such a motion, and no meet
and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2033.280; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition,
a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Id.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014) 223
Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the matters contained in the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the
discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery.”  Where a
party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may
impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd.
(a).)
Discussion
On October
24, 2022, Defendant served on Tipple Special
Interrogatories (Set One) and Form Interrogatories (Set One); the same day,
Defendant served on Esquivel Requests for Admission (Set One).  (Bakshandeh Decls., ¶ 2 & Exhs.
A.)  Neither Plaintiff has served
responses. (Bakshandeh Decls., ¶ 12.) 
Defendant need show nothing more.  As to the interrogatories, Defendant’s motions
to compel are granted.
As to the requests for admission, Defendant’s motion to deem
admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission is
granted.
Defendant’s
requests for sanctions are granted in part. 
Given the relatively straightforward nature of a motion to compel
initial responses, and the economies of scale associated with filing multiple
parallel motions, the Court awards sanctions on each motion in the amount of $510,
calculated as 1.5 hours of attorney work on each motion, multiplied by a
reasonable rate for this work of $300 per hour, plus the filing fee of $60 per
motion.  (See Bakshandeh Decl., ¶ 14.)
Conclusion
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendant’s two motions to
compel.
Plaintiff Tipple is ORDERED to provide verified,
code-compliant, written responses, without objections, to Defendant’s Special
Interrogatories (Set One) and Form Interrogatories (Set One) within 30 days of
the notice of this order.
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion for a “deem
admitted” order.  The Court DEEMS
ADMITTED THE TRUTH of the matters specified in Requests for Admission (Set One)
directed to Plaintiff Esquivel.
The Court
GRANTS Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions in part. 
 
Plaintiff
Tipple and counsel of record Yoon Kim are ORDERED, jointly and severally, to
pay monetary sanctions to Defendant in the total amount of $1,020 within 30
days of notice of this order. 
 
In
addition, Plaintiff Esquivel and counsel of record Yoon Kim are ORDERED,
jointly and severally, to pay monetary sanctions to Defendant in the total
amount of $510 within 30 days of notice of this order.
 
Moving
