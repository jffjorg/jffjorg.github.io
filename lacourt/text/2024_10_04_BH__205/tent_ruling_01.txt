  Case Number:  23SMCP00651    Hearing Date:   October 4, 2024    Dept:  205    Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District  Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205   EDEN REFORESTRATION PROJECTS, et al.  Petitioners, v.  ASPIRATION PARTNERS, INC., et al.,   Respondents.    Case No.:  23SMCP00651     Hearing Date:  October 4, 2024   [TENTATIVE] order RE:   PETITIONERS’ MOTION FOR    ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE RE:    CONTEMPT      This hearing is on Petitioners Eden Reforestation Projects and Compassionate Carbon’s motion for order to show cause re: contempt.  The motion relates to allegedly deficient responses by the CEO of Respondents Aspiration Partners, Inc. and Aspiration Partners, to a subpoena in connection with a debtor’s examination.  It is therefore a discovery motion. This Departments’ rules require that on a discovery motion, where informal meet and efforts have failed, the parties are required to schedule an informal discovery conference (“IDC”).  No IDC was scheduled.  Accordingly, the Court denies the motion for order to show cause re: contempt.    DATED:  October 4, 2024              ___________________________ Edward B.
