```

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for relief from dismissal. The plaintiff was dismissed from the case due to her attorney's failure to file required case management conference (CMC) statements and appear at two CMCs. The plaintiff's attorney claims that his failure to comply was due to his illness and disability, but the judge has found that this is not a valid excuse. The judge has concluded that the plaintiff is not entitled to mandatory relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b) because the dismissal was for failure to prosecute, and there is no showing of excusable neglect that would justify discretionary relief. The judge has also found that the attorney's disability is not the actual reason for the failure to attend the CMCs.
