 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Plaintiffs Ivy Flores and Amanda Portobanco’s Motion to Compel
  the Deposition of Defendant Mazda Motor of America, Inc.’s Person(s) Most Knowledgeable
  with Production of Documents.



 
Background
Pleadings
Plaintiffs Ivy Flores and Amanda
Portobanco (Plaintiffs) sue Defendant Mazda Motor of America, Inc. (Mazda) and
Does 1 through 20 pursuant to a Complaint alleging two Song-Beverly Consumer
Warranty Act claims and an Unfair Competition claim pursuant to Business and
Professions Code section 17200, et seq.
The claims arise from allegations
that on April 12, 2018, Plaintiffs purchased a new 2018 Mazda CX-5 (Subject
Vehicle), related to which Plaintiffs received various express warranties from
Mazda, only for the Subject Vehicle to exhibit or develop powertrain control
module and transmission defects, acceleration issues, rear shock leaking,
seatbelt malfunctions, abnormal noises, bouncy suspension, Bluetooth
connectivity issues, lack of power, and startup issues, with Mazda’s authorized
repair and service facilities failing to conform the Subject Vehicle to
applicable warranties.
Motion Before the Court
On September 11, 2023, Plaintiffs
noticed the deposition of Mazda’s person most qualified (PMQ, briefed as PMK) for
discovery into Mazda's business practice of sending repurchase offers to
California consumers that are in violation of its obligations under
Song-Beverly and therefore are an unlawful business practice in violation of
Business and Professions Code section 17200. The deposition was set for
September 25, 2023.
On September 20, 2023, Mazda served
objections to the deposition notice.
On October 9, 2023, Plaintiffs’
counsel sent correspondence to Mazda’s counsel, seeking to meet and confer
regarding Mazda’s objections by October 13, 2023.
On October 13, 2023, Mazda’s
counsel indicated that it would not provide a witness because the discovery
cutoff had expired.
On October 17, 2023, Plaintiffs’
counsel responded to the October 13, 2023 meet and confer effort.
On October 20, 2023, counsel had a telephone
meet and confer, which did not resolve the deposition dispute.
On October 26, 2023, Plaintiffs
filed a motion to compel the deposition of Mazda’s PMQ. The motion does not
seek sanctions.
On January 10, 2024, Mazda opposed
Plaintiffs’ motion.
On January 17, 2024, Plaintiffs
replied to the opposition.
Plaintiffs’ motion is now before
the Court.
 
Motion to Compel Deposition, Person Most Qualified

Legal Standard
If, [1] after service of a
deposition notice, [2] a party to the action or an officer, director, managing
agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that
is a party under Section 2025.230, [3] without having served a valid objection
under Section 2025.410, [4] fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with
it, or to produce for inspection any document, electronically stored
information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, [5] the
party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s
attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a) [Arabic numerals
added for clarity].)
If the deponent named is not a
natural person, the deposition notice shall describe with reasonable
particularity the matters on which examination is requested. In that event, the
deponent shall designate and produce at the deposition those of its officers,
directors, managing agents, employees, or agents who are most qualified to
testify on its behalf as to those matters to the extent of any information
known or reasonably available to the deponent. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.230.)
The motion shall set forth specific
facts showing good cause justifying the production for inspection of any
document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (b)(1).)
The motion shall also be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when
the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents,
electronically stored information, or things described in the deposition
notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent
to inquire about the nonappearance. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd.
(b)(2).)
If the proposed deponent made some
response to the deposition notice, then a separate statement must accompany any
motion to compel deposition attendance or production. (See Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1345, subd. (b).)
Order Compelling Deposition(s):
DENIED.
Here, after review, the Court
determines that Plaintiffs’ motion was filed beyond the applicable discovery
cutoff and discovery motion hearing cutoff dates.
The original trial date in this
action was December 6, 2022. (See Opp’n, Ekblad Decl., Ex. A [3/25/21 Minutes,
Case Management Conference, setting trial date].) That trial date yielded a
discovery cutoff date of Friday, November 14, 2022 and a discovery motion
hearing cutoff date of Monday, November 21, 2022. (See Code Civ. Proc., §
2024.020, subd. (a).) This motion was filed on October 26, 2023 and is being
heard on January 24, 2024, well after November 21, 2022. (See Mot., p. 1.)
Mazda correctly notes that while
discovery cutoff dates have been extended in this action, those extensions did
not apply to the type of deposition at issue here. (See Opp’n, pp. 5-6.) The
extensions related to discovery that was being pursued as of the cutoff date,
the taking of Plaintiffs’ deposition, an inspection of the Vehicle, the taking
of expert and dealership depositions, and written discovery dated May 11, 2022.
(See Opp’n, Ekblad Decl., Ex. E, p. 2 [March 2023 Joint Stipulation to Continue
Trial and Certain Discovery and Motion Deadlines].)
In reply, Plaintiffs argue that “an
extension of the discovery cut-off is appropriate here[] because of Defendant’s
admitted evasion with regard to the information sought” (Reply, p. 2), which
tacitly concedes that the discovery cutoff argument by Mazda is meritorious.
Plaintiffs also argue that an
extension of the discovery deadline is appropriate here to remedy Defendants’
evasive discovery tactics and that, per California authorities, the Court may
grant a request to extend a discovery cutoff deadline without a noticed motion.
(Reply, p. 2.) However, the Court finds that on this record, there is an insufficient
showing of diligence on the part of Plaintiffs or evasion on the part of the Defendants
to order an extension of the discovery cut-off, although this conclusion is
without prejudice. The Court notes that the continued trial date is set on
February 20, 2024 and this date has already been continued several times. 
Plaintiffs’ motion is DENIED. 
Conclusion
Plaintiffs Ivy Flores and Amanda
Portobanco’s Motion to Compel the Deposition of Defendant Mazda Motor of
America, Inc.’s Person(s) Most Knowleedgeable with Production of Documents is
DENIED.
