And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies Defendant/Cross-Defendant Your Home Sold Guaranteed Realty, Inc.'s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories (Set One) of Stephanie Yun, and Request for Sanctions (CRS# 8695). The motion was filed seven days after the challenged discovery responses were served, and the declarations of YHSG's counsel fail to explain whether there were meet and confer efforts between service of the challenged discovery responses and the filing of this motion. The court finds that YHSG's motion is directed at compelling further responses to FROGs, Set One, No. 17.1 from Cross-Defendant Stephanie Yun, but YHSG failed to sufficiently meet and confer as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300. As a result, the motion is denied. Additionally, the court denies YHSG's request for monetary sanctions because the motion was denied.
