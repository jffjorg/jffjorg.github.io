Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled in favor of Defendant Ji Young Joo's motion to set aside the default and default judgment against her. The court finds that Ji Young Joo was not served with the summons and complaint and did not learn of the lawsuit until July 21, 2023, and that she has shown diligence in seeking relief once the default or default judgment was discovered. The court also finds that Ji Young Joo has a potentially meritorious defense and that the lack of specific allegations as to her, the absence of a contract with her name on it, and her various denials of having any relationship to the defendants in the proposed answer and in her declaration are sufficient to establish a bona fide and potentially meritorious defense. The court grants Ji Young Joo's motion and orders that the answer be filed within 5 calendar days.
