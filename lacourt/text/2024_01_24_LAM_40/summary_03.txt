And here is the English-text summary:

The Tentative Ruling denies Defendant South Cord Holdings, LLC's (SCH) motion to compel arbitration against Plaintiff Veronica Romero. The motion is based on an arbitration agreement between Romero and SCH, which was not attached to SCH's initial motion to compel arbitration. The Court finds that SCH failed to provide a satisfactory explanation for its failure to include the agreement in the initial motion, and that the delay in presenting this evidence is fatal. The Court also construes the renewed motion as a renewed motion to compel arbitration, which must be supported by new evidence and a satisfactory explanation for the failure to produce that evidence at an earlier time.
