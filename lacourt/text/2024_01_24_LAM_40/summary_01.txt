Here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has considered the motion by Plaintiffs Ivy Flores and Amanda Portobanco to compel the deposition of Defendant Mazda Motor of America, Inc.'s person most knowledgeable with production of documents. The Court has determined that the motion was filed beyond the applicable discovery cutoff and discovery motion hearing cutoff dates, and therefore, the Court denies the motion. The Court notes that while the discovery cutoff dates have been extended in this action, those extensions did not apply to the type of deposition at issue here. The Court also notes that the continued trial date is set on February 20, 2024, and this date has already been continued several times.
