Background
Pleadings
Plaintiffs Yesenia Reyes, Veronica
Romero, and Sam Barrad sue Defendants South Cord Holdings, LLC (SCH), Doe 1 562
Discount Med Inc., Doe 2 316 Florence Holdings, LLC, Doe 3 Ryan Cameron Rayburn
Collective, Inc., Doe 4 Portlock Holdings, LLC, Doe 5 South Cord Management,
LLC, Does 6 through 10 pursuant to a June 2, 2023 Complaint alleging claims of
(1) Harassment, (2) Gender Discrimination, (3) Retaliation, (4) Retaliation
(Labor Code § 1102.5), (5) Negligent Hiring, Supervision, or Retaliation of
Employee, (6) Failure to Prevent Harassment and/or Discrimination, and (7)
Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy.
The claims arise from allegations
that in their employment with SCH, Plaintiffs experienced the above statutory
and tortious violations.
Prior Arbitration History
On July 11, 2023, SCH moved to
compel arbitration pursuant to (1) a collective bargaining agreement allegedly
covering Plaintiffs and (2) an arbitration agreement signed by Plaintiff Reyes
and specific as to her alone.
On September 6, 2023, Plaintiffs
opposed the motion.
On September 11, 2023, SCH replied
to the opposition.
On September 19, 2023, the Court
granted SCH’s motion as to Plaintiff Reyes but denied the motion as to
Plaintiffs Romero and Barrad.
Motion Before the Court
On November 15, 2023, SCH made a
renewed motion to compel arbitration against Plaintiff Romero. The motion is
premised on an arbitration agreement not attached to the July 11, 2023 motion
to compel arbitration.
On January 11, 2024, Plaintiff
Romero opposed SCH’s motion.
On January 16, 2024, SCH replied to
Romero’s opposition.
Defendant SCH’s motion to compel
arbitration is now before the Court.
 
Renewed Motion to Compel Arbitration
Legal
Standard 
A
party who originally made an application for an order which was refused in
whole or part, or granted conditionally or on terms, may make a subsequent
application for the same order upon new or different facts, circumstances, or
law, in which case it shall be shown by affidavit what application was made
before, when and to what judge, what order or decisions were made, and what new
or different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown. For a
failure to comply with this subdivision, any order made on a subsequent
application may be revoked or set aside on ex parte motion. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (b).)
For
renewed motion purposes, a moving party must provide not only new evidence but
also a satisfactory explanation for the failure to produce that evidence at an
earlier time. (See California Correctional Peace Officers Assn. v. Virga
(2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 30, 46-48 (Virga) [affirming trial court order
denying what amounted to a renewed motion for attorney fees “in the absence of
a sufficient explanation why appellants did not rely on the federal statute
[new law] in their original motion”]; accord. Baldwin v. Home Savings of
America (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1192, 1198, 1200-1201 (Baldwin)
[reversing trial court order granting motion for reconsideration of an attorney
fees award where “[c]ounsel [asking for reconsideration] made no effort
whatsoever to explain the failure to previously present the case, then two
years old, or the principle for which it stands, as an alternative basis for
denial of appellants’ motion for attorney fees” pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., §
1008, subd. (a)].)
Renewed
motions under section 1008, subdivision (b) differ in substance and procedures
from motions for reconsideration under section 1008, subdivision (a). (Tate
v. Wilburn (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 150, 160.) Unlike a motion for reconsideration,
a renewed motion does not ask the court to modify, amend, or revoke the prior
order, but instead it is a pure renewal of the first motion. (California
Correctional Peace Officers Assn. v. Virga (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 30,
42-43). A renewal motion is proper even if the moving party concedes that the
court’s initial ruling was correct but is now erroneous in light of changed
circumstances. (Deauville Restaurant, Inc. v. Superior Court (2001) 90
Cal.App.4th 843, 848 (Deauville Restaurant).)
Other
key differences between a motion for reconsideration and a renewed motion is
that a renewed motion can only be brought by the party whose original motion
was denied in whole or in part, has no time limit for filing, and need not be
considered by the same judge who denied the original motion. (Deauville
Restaurant, supra, 90 Cal.App.4th at p. 851.) However, statutory
or jurisdictional deadlines attached to the underlying motions remain
applicable. (See, e.g., Kunysz v. Sandler (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1540,
1543 [motion to renew an anti-SLAPP motion, brought nine months after the first
amended complaint was filed, was untimely because it was outside the 60-day
statutory period for filing an anti-SLAPP motion]; see also Code Civ. Proc., §
660 [court cannot reconsider an order denying a motion for new trial after the
jurisdictional 60-day period for the court to grant or deny that motion has
passed]; Jones v. Sieve (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 359, 370 [“the power of a
trial court to rule on a motion for a new trial is constrained by the
jurisdictional 60–day limitation period of section 660, which is a specific
statute, and cannot be extended or expanded by the procedural device of moving
under section 1008, a general statute, for reconsideration of an order granting
or denying a new trial motion, which necessarily involves a request to correct
judicial error”].)
Order
Granting Renewed Motion to Compel Arbitration: DENIED.
In
opposition to SCH’s motion, Plaintiff Romero argues that the motion should be
denied as a renewed motion to compel arbitration for which there is no showing
of reasonable diligence. (Opp’n, pp. 2-6.) The Court agrees.
A
trial court may construe a motion bearing one label as a different type of
motion. (Austin v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist. (2016) 244
Cal.App.4th 918, 930.) “‘The nature of a motion is determined by the nature of
the relief sought, not by the label attached to it. The law is not a mere game
of words. … The principle that a trial court may consider a motion regardless
of the label placed on it by a party is consistent with the court’s inherent
authority to manage and control its docket.’ [Citation.]” (Ibid.; see,
e.g., Deauville Restaurant, supra, 90 Cal.App.4th 843, 849-850
[construing a second application for writ of attachment based on additional
evidence and new circumstances as a renewed motion pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 1008, subdivision (b)].)
Here,
on July 11, 2023, SCH filed a motion to compel arbitration against all three
Plaintiffs based on two arbitration agreements, the first a collective
bargaining agreement involving all three Plaintiffs, and the second involving
Plaintiff Reyes and SCH alone. On September 19, 2023, after full briefing from
the parties, the Court denied the motion to compel arbitration as to Plaintiff
Romero. SCH now comes before the Court, again asking for an order compelling
Plaintiff Romero’s claims into arbitration. This renewed motion is based on an arbitration
agreement between Romero and SCH alone that was not attached to SCH’s July 11,
2023 motion or considered by the Court on September 19, 2023. The Court
construes these circumstances as a renewed motion to compel arbitration against
Plaintiff Romero, as it is based on additional evidence not previously filed
with the Court. (Cf. Deauville Restaurant, supra, 90 Cal.App.4th at
pp. 849-850.)
SCH
does not properly explain why the purported Romero-SCH arbitration agreement
was not attached to the July 11, 2023 motion. (See Mot., Augustini Decl., ¶¶
3-6 [explaining how co-counsel only recently discovered the existence of this
agreement when responding to discovery from Plaintiff Romero].) SCH argues that
the explanation cannot be “more detailed … [because] it might require counsel
to invade both the attorney-client privilege and the attorney work product
doctrine.” (Reply, p. 4.) While the Court sympathizes with SCH’s counsel’s late
discovery of this agreement, a review of that agreement shows that it was
purportedly signed on August 20, 2021, meaning it was in SCH’s possession for
nearly two years prior to July 11, 2023, when SCH filed its initial motion to
compel arbitration. (Mot., Halushka Decl., Ex. A.) Counsel’s declaration does
not justify this prior delay, which is fatal because, given that SCH has had
possession of the agreement since August 2021, there is no satisfactory
explanation for SCH’s failure to argue or include the Romero-SCH agreement in
the initial July 11, 2023 motion to compel arbitration. (See Mot., Augustini
Decl., ¶¶ 1-6; cf. Virga, supra, 181 Cal.App.4th at pp. 46-48; Baldwin,
supra, 59 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1198, 1200-1201.) 
SCH’s
motion is thus DENIED.  

Conclusion
Defendant South Cord Holdings,
LLC’s Motion to Compel Arbitration Against Plaintiff Veronica Romero is DENIED.
