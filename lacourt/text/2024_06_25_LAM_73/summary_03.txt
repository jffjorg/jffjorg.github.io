And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

Judge Rolf Treu has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Kimi Kim v. Jacob Wooher (23STCV26561). The case involves a dispute over a judgment debt and the enforcement of a judgment against the judgment debtor.

The judge has granted the defendant's application for an order for appearance and examination of the judgment debtor, which will require the judgment debtor to appear before the court to provide information to aid in the enforcement of the judgment.

The judge has also denied the plaintiff's motion for modification of the amount of attorneys' fees granted to the defendant in a previous court order. The judge found that the motion was an improper motion for reconsideration, as it did not present any new facts, circumstances, or law to support the request for modification.
