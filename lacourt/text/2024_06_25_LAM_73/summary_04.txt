And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted plaintiff Eric Puig's motions to compel responses to form interrogatories propounded on defendant GP Group LLC. The defendant failed to respond to the interrogatories, which is a violation of the California Code of Civil Procedure. As a result, the court has ordered the defendant to provide verified responses within 30 days.

Additionally, the court has granted plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions against the defendant and its attorney, in the reduced amount of $1,750. This sanction is due to the defendant's failure to respond to the interrogatories, and is intended to compensate the plaintiff for the time and effort spent on the motions.

The court has also ordered the plaintiff to provide notice of the order and file a proof of service of the same.
