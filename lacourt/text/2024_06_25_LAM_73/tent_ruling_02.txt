I. BACKGROUND
 
On August 23, 2023, Plaintiff Atlas Capital, Inc. brought this breach
of contract action against Defendant Temple Poteat.
 
The Complaint alleges that Plaintiff and Defendant entered into two
loan agreements, which Defendant subsequently defaulted on. (Compl., p. 4.) Defendant
had filed for Chapter 13 Bankruptcy, which was ultimately dismissed on August
16, 2023. (Ibid.) Plaintiff is seeking balance due on both loan
agreements, interest, late fees and attorney fees. (Compl., p. 3.)
 
Defendant filed an answer on September 29, 2023. 
 
On April 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed the Motion
to Deem Request for Admissions, Set One, Admitted and Request for Sanctions. No
opposition has been filed.
 
II. ANALYSIS
 
A.     Legal
Standard 
 
 When a party fails to
serve a timely response to a request for admission, the party propounding the
request for admission may move for an order to deem the genuineness of any
documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests admitted.
(Code Civ. Proc., §¿2033.280, subd. (b).) A party who fails to provide a timely
response waives any objection, including one based on privilege or work
product. (Id., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) “The court shall make this order,
unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been
directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to
the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section
2033.220. It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction… on the
party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to
requests for admission necessitated this motion.” (Id., § 2033.280,
subd. (c).)
 
B.     Discussion
 
Here, Plaintiff
served Request for Admissions, Set One on Defendant on December 13, 2023. (Shoumer
Decl. ¶ 3, Exh. 1.) Defendant’s response was due on or before January 17, 2024.
(Id. ¶ 4.) No response has been served. (Id. ¶ 5.)  Therefore, because a response
has not been served, the motion is granted. The truth
of the matters specified in Request for Admissions, Set One, are hereby deemed
admitted.
 
Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions for counsel’s work on its
Motion to Deem Request
for Admissions, Set One, Admitted against
Defendant. Plaintiff requests a total of $1,335.00, representing 2 hours spent
on the motion and an hour to appear at the hearing, at an hourly rate of $425, plus
$60 for the filing fee. (Id. ¶ 6.)   
 
The Court finds sanctions are warranted because Defendant has
failed to respond. Therefore, the Court awards Plaintiff’s request for sanctions
in the total amount of $1,335.00. 
 
III. DISPOSITION
 
Plaintiff’s
Motion to Deem Request for Admissions, Set One, Admitted is GRANTED. The truth of the matters specified in Request for Admissions,
Set One, are hereby deemed admitted.
 
The
Court further GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions against Defendant
in the amount of $1,335.00.
Said monetary sanctions are to be paid to counsel for Plaintiff within 30 days
of the date of this order. 
 
Plaintiff shall provide notice of the Court’s order and file a proof of
service of such.
