  Case Number:  22STCV04785    Hearing Date:   March 14, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:
Amended Demurrer of Defendant, The San Gabriel Valley Council of Governments,
In Furtherance of The Alameda Corridor-East Construction Project, To First
Amended Complaint.
 
BACKGROUND
In this case, Plaintiff EL ADOBE APTS., INC. (“Plaintiff”)
alleges that Defendant THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS, IN
FURTHERANCE OF THE ALAMEDA CORRIDOR-EAST CONSTRUCTION PROJECT (“Defendant”) failed
to convey three parcels of land to Plaintiff in violation of a written
settlement agreement between the parties.  Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint (“FAC”),
filed on 8/28/2023, alleges claims against Defendant for: (1) Breach of
Contract/Specific Performance of Contract; (2) Quiet Title; (3) Breach of the
Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; (4) Declaratory Relief; (5)
Nuisance; and (6) Negligent Interference with a Prospective Economic Advantage.
Defendant brings this demurrer to all the claims in
the FAC. Plaintiff opposes the demurrer. 
LEGAL STANDARD
Demurrers are to be sustained where a pleading fails
to plead adequately any essential element of the cause of action.  Cantu v. Resolution Trust Corp. (1992)
4 Cal.App.4th 857, 879-80. A court will consider judicially noticed matters
when determining the sufficiency of a complaint. Poseidon Dev., Inc. v.
Woodland Lane Ests., LLC (2007) 152 Cal. App. 4th 1106, 1117.
JUDICIAL NOTICE
Defendant seeks judicial notice of (1) the judgment in
the underlying condemnation lawsuit (which was also attached to the FAC), (2)
the recorded Grant Deed No. 20230488803 pertaining to Parcel No. 208S; (3) the
recorded Grant Deed No. 20230488804 pertaining to Parcel No. 208R; and (4) the
recorded Grant Deed no. 20230488805 pertaining to Parcel No. 208U. The Court
takes judicial notice of these four documents. 
ANALYSIS
Judicially Noticed Facts Negate
Allegations in FAC
Plaintiff’s first, second, third, and fourth claims
are premised on the allegation that Defendant failed to convey Parcels 208-R,
S, and U pursuant to the parties’ settlement agreement. (SAC, ¶¶ 13, 15, 20,
27, 29, 37, 46.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendant is liable for breach of
contract, quiet title, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair
dealing, and declaratory judgment because it failed to convey the parcels to
Plaintiff. (See id.) 
The judicially noticed grant deeds reflect that
Defendant conveyed Parcels 208-R, S, and U to Plaintiff in June 2023, before
Plaintiff filed the FAC. Defendant correctly argues that the grant deeds negate
Plaintiff’s allegations that Defendant failed to convey Parcels 208-R, S, and U.
Plaintiff argues that the Court can only consider its allegations in considering
the demurrer, but this ignores the well-settled law that the Court can consider
judicially noticed maters when considering the legal sufficiency of a
complaint. And Plaintiff’s allegations are not accepted as true for
purposes of a demurrer when judicially noticed facts disclose an absolute
defense. Kalnoki v. First American Trustee Servicing Solutions, LLC
(2017) 8 Cal. App. 5th 23, 38-39; Cansino v. Bank of America (2014) 224
Cal. App. 4th 1462, 1474. Here, the judicially noticed facts are that Defendant
conveyed the parcels to Plaintiff, which means that Plaintiff’s claims alleging
the exact opposite fail as a matter of law. The Court will grant leave to amend
because Plaintiff may be able to articulate a theory of recovery against
Defendant despite the conveyance of these parcels in June 2023. 
Non-Compliance with the
California Claims Act 
Defendant contends that Plaintiff’s first, third, fifth,
and sixth causes of action fail as a matter of law because these claims seek
monetary damages, but Plaintiff failed to allege compliance with the claim
requirements set forth in the California Claims Act, Gov. Code Section 900 et
seq.  Subject to certain exceptions set
forth in Government Code Section 905 (none of which apply here), a plaintiff
suing a public entity for money or damages must first present a timely written
claim for damages to the entity. Gov’t Code § 945.4; Johnson v. San Diego
Unified Sch. Dist. (1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 692, 696. Failing to allege facts demonstrating
or excusing compliance with the claim requirements in the California Claims Act
subjects a complaint to demurrer. State v. Sup. Ct. (Bodde) (2004) 32
Cal. 4th 1234, 1245. 
Here, the four claims seek money damages against
Defendant, a public entity. Plaintiff does not, however, plead compliance with
the claims requirement in the California Claims Act. Plaintiff does not even
address this argument in its opposition, let alone contest its failure to
comply with the claims requirement. A party’s complete silence in an opposition
to an issue raised in a motion results in a waiver the
right to argue the matter in trial court and on appeal. Assad v. Southern
Pacific Transportation Co.  (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 1609, 1615. The
Court therefore sustains the demurrer on this ground. Because Plaintiff may have
complied with the claims requirement but just failed to allege such compliance,
the demurrer to these claims is sustained with leave to amend. 
 
CONCLUSION
The demurrer is sustained with 20 days’ leave to
amend.
