Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case, addressing a demurrer with motion to strike filed by Defendants ADC, Boltier R&D, and Hun Choe to Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint. The Plaintiffs, Mika Yamamori and Johnny Pham, allege wage and hour violations against the Defendants. The Judge has overruled the demurrer and denied the motion to strike, finding that the Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged employer-related liability against each Defendant and that the appointment of a receiver is justified to restore wages unfairly acquired by means of unfair competition.
