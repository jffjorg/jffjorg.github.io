And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendant, The San Gabriel Valley Council of Governments, to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint. The plaintiff, El Adobe Apts., Inc., alleges that the defendant failed to convey three parcels of land in violation of a written settlement agreement. The defendant argues that the plaintiff's claims are premised on the allegation that the defendant failed to convey the parcels, but the judicially noticed grant deeds reflect that the defendant conveyed the parcels in June 2023, before the plaintiff filed the complaint.

The judge finds that the judicially noticed facts negate the plaintiff's allegations and that the plaintiff's claims alleging the exact opposite fail as a matter of law. The judge grants leave to amend because the plaintiff may be able to articulate a theory of recovery against the defendant despite the conveyance of the parcels.

The defendant also argues that the plaintiff's claims seeking monetary damages fail as a matter of law because the plaintiff failed to plead compliance with the claim requirements set forth in the California Claims Act. The judge sustains the demurrer on this ground, finding that the plaintiff's failure to plead compliance with the claims requirement is fatal to the claims.

The judge sustains the demurrer with 20 days' leave to amend and orders the plaintiff to file an amended complaint that complies with the California Claims Act.
