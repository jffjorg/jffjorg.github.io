 Case Number:  21STCV45711    Hearing Date:   June 18, 2024    Dept:  T Motion to Set Aside/Vacate DefaultTentative Ruling:  GrantedBACKGROUNDPlaintiffs April Ascencio (“Ascencio”) and Julian Gonzalez filed this action against defendants Susanne Lorraine Tisdall (“Tisdall”) and Does 1 to 20 for injuries arising from a motor vehicle collision.  On January 10, 2024, Tisdall filed a cross-complaint against Ascencio and Roes 1 to 25 for indemnification, apportionment of fault, and declaratory relief.  On March 5, 2024, Tisdall obtained Ascencio’s default.  On May 24, 2024, Ascencio filed the instant motion to vacate the default entered against her pursuant to Cal. Civ. Proc. 473(b). Any opposition was due on or before June 5, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date.DISCUSSIONApplicable LawCal. Civ. Proc. 473(b) provides that an application for relief must be made no more than six months after entry of the judgment, dismissal, order or other proceeding from which relief is sought and must be accompanied by an affidavit of fault attesting to the mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect of the moving party or its attorney. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130, 143.)Application to FactsUnder the mandatory relief provision, judges must vacate dismissals, default entries, and default judgments “whenever (1) an application is made no more than six months after entry of judgment, (2) the application is accompanied by an attorney's sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, and (3) the attorney's mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect in fact caused the dismissal or entry of default.” (Benedict v. Danner Press (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 923, 927 (citing CCP §473(b)).)  Here, the application was timely made within six months after default. Ascencio is represented by The JLF Firm as a plaintiff to this action, but Ascencio is also represented by Martinez, Dieterich, & Zarcone Legal Group (“MDZL”) as a cross-defendant. Ascencio’s counsel of MDZL declares that the cross-complaint filed against Ascencio was served on the JLF Firm. The JLF Firm notified Ascencio’s insurance carrier of the cross-complaint, but no response was received. Thereafter, default was entered against Ascencio, and MDZL was notified of the default. The insurance carrier then notified MDZL of the default, and on April 29, 2024, Ascenscio gave permission to MDZL to represent her in defending against the cross-complaint. Ascencio’s counsel avers that it was a mistake that default was entered against her, which could have been prevented had the legal representatives promptly addressed the cross-complaint. No parties oppose the motion. The Court finds that counsel’s straightforward admission of fault is sufficient to set aside the dismissal. (State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. v. Pietak (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 600 609-610 [In order to qualify for mandatory relief, an affidavit from an attorney must be a straightforward admission of fault.].)    CONCLUSIONThe motion to set aside default under Cal. Civ. Proc. 473(b) is GRANTED. Moving party is ordered to give notice.
