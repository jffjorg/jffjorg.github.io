And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has granted the motion to set aside the default entered against April Ascencio. The default was entered on March 5, 2024, after Tisdall filed a cross-complaint against Ascencio and obtained default. Ascencio's counsel, The JLF Firm, notified Ascencio's insurance carrier of the cross-complaint, but no response was received. As a result, default was entered against Ascencio. Ascencio's new counsel, Martinez, Dieterich, & Zarcone Legal Group (MDZL), was notified of the default and obtained permission from Ascencio to represent her in defending against the cross-complaint. Ascencio's counsel has admitted that it was a mistake that default was entered against her, which could have been prevented had the legal representatives promptly addressed the cross-complaint. Since no opposition was filed to the motion, the court finds that counsel's straightforward admission of fault is sufficient to set aside the dismissal.
