And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Defendants' motion to compel arbitration in part and denies in part. The judge finds that the arbitration agreement is valid and enforceable, but that the sexual harassment claims are not subject to the arbitration agreement due to the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021 (EFAA). The judge also finds that the individual PAGA claim is subject to the arbitration agreement.

The judge grants judicial notice of other trial court orders, sustains Plaintiff's evidentiary objections to the Andrade declaration, and strikes the declaration as untimely.

The judge finds that the arbitration agreement is not unconscionable and that the provisions regarding discovery, confidentiality, costs, and judicial review are reasonable. The judge also finds that the provision allowing the arbitrator to award attorneys' fees to the prevailing party is not unconscionable.

Finally, the judge exercises its discretion to stay Plaintiff's sexual harassment and representative PAGA claim pending the outcome of arbitration on the individual PAGA claim.
