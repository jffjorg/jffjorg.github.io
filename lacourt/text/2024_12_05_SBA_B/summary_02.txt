And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on an ex parte application to continue the trial and all related dates and deadlines. The case involves a premises liability claim against Los Angeles World Airports, a public entity, and others. The parties have failed to comply with previous court orders, including an order to conduct a mediation and post-mediation status conference. Despite this, the parties have requested a continuance of the trial, which is currently set for February 5, 2025.

The judge has ordered the parties to meet and confer and prepare a joint discovery plan, which must be filed by December 9, 2024. The plan must include information about past and future discovery, including depositions, interrogatories, and document requests. The parties must also explain why they failed to comply with the June 6, 2024 mediation completion date and why a mediation is now scheduled for April 12, 2025.

The judge has also set the ex parte application for hearing on December 12, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. The judge is unlikely to grant the parties' request for a further continuance of the trial, as they have already requested a delay of nearly three months.
