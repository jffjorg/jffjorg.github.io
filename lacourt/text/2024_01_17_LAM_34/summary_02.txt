And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to deem admitted the truth of matters specified in Defendant Westpark Equity Group, Inc.'s Requests for Admission (RFAs). The RFAs were served on Plaintiffs Adelina McCloud and Ellina Kelly on August 19, 2023, but they failed to respond to the RFAs. Therefore, the judge has deemed the RFAs admitted. The judge has also denied the request for sanctions, which sought $4,000.00 in monetary sanctions against the Plaintiffs. The judge noted that the Plaintiffs are litigating this matter in propria persona, and monetary sanctions would not be appropriate at this time.
