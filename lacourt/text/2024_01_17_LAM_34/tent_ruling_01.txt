ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal
Standard
 
A.         
Legal
Standard
 
California Code of Civil Procedure requires a
response from the party to whom form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and
demand requests are propounded within 30 days after service of the requests,
unless the time is extended by agreement of the parties. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.260, subd. (a), 2030.270, subd. (a), 2031.260, subd. (a), 2031.270, subd.
(a).) If a party fails to serve timely responses, "the party making the
demand may move for an order compelling response to the demand.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (b).) By failing to respond, the offending party
waives any objection to the demand. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)
 
For a motion to compel, all a propounding
party must show is that it properly served its discovery requests, that the
time to respond has expired, and that the party to whom the requests were
directed failed to provide a timely response. (See Leach v. Super. Ct.
(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905, 906.) Indeed, "[o]nce [a party] 'fail[ed]
to serve a timely response,' the trial court had authority to grant [opposing
party's] motion to compel responses." (Sinaiko Healthcare Counseling, Inc.
v. Pac. Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 405.)
 
The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel motions for
interrogatories or requests for production, unless the Court finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails
to obey an order compelling answers, the court may make those orders that are
just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In
lieu of or in addition to that sanction, the court may impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c).)
 
II.      
Discussion
 
LAX Shopping, LLC moves the Court to compel James Goodman Architecture,
Architectural Corporation to fully and completely respond to both sets of
requests for production of documents (“RPDs”) served upon it by LAX Shopping,
LLC. (Plaintiff’s Initial RPDs Motion Against Goodman, pp. 7:23–24, 8:1–3.) At
this time, LAX Shopping, LLC does not move for monetary sanctions. (Id. at
p. 7:17–22.)
 
, Counsel for LAX Shopping, LLC, Nico N. Tabibi, declares that no
responses have been received to either set of RPDs. (Plaintiff’s Initial RPDs
Motion Against Goodman, Decl. Tabibi, ¶ 17.)  There is no evidence before the Court that
would indicate James Goodman Architecture, Architectural Corporation has responded
to the RPDs. 
 
        
III.     Conclusion
 
Plaintiff’s Initial RPDs Motion Against Goodman is GRANTED.
 
        James Goodman Architecture,
Architectural Corporation shall provide initial responses to both sets of RPDs
within twenty (20) days of the issuance of this Order.
