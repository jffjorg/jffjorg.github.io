  Case Number:  19STCV04540    Hearing Date:   April 12, 2024    Dept:  57 Defendants
Valenzuela and Taglioli (collectively “Moving Defendants”) move for an order
awarding appellate attorneys’ fees against Plaintiffs on the grounds that
Valenzuela and Taglioli are the prevailing party in the action and entitled to attorneys’
fees and costs by contract. In particular, the Moving Defendants
seek $225,367.50 in fees band request $2,452.10 in costs per
their Memorandum of Costs.  The Court is granting the motion.
          
The Court rejects Plaintiffs’ position that the
hearing on the Moving Defendants fee motion should be continued.  On May 11, 2021, this Court entered judgment
for Moving Defendants, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeal on October 13,
2023 . Because the judgment was affirmed, Rule 3.1702(c) of the California
Rules of Court applies. (See Moore & Thomas, Cal. Civil Practice Procedure
(2023) § 41:66.)  Under Rule 3.1702(c),
the time to serve and file a noticed motion to recover attorneys’ fees is within
40 days after issuance of the remittitur. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rules 3.1702(c)
and 8.278(c)(1).) On January 12, 2024, the Court of Appeal issued a Remittitur,
and on February 8, 2024, Moving Defendants timely filed the instant Motion. 
 
Plaintiffs
do not contend that Moving Defendants’ appellate counsel are not entitled to an
award of fees and costs. Instead, Plaintiffs contend that the $875 per hour
rate of attorneys Albers and Serlin is unreasonable and that they billed
unreasonable hours of work. (Plaintiffs do not dispute the reasonableness of the
paralegal’s hourly rate of $225 and 22.8 hours billed.) 
 
The Court
disagrees that $875 is an unreasonable hourly rate. Albers and Serlin’s declarations
show that this rate is reasonable in the Los Angeles community for appellate
work performed by attorneys with comparable experience. (Albers Decl.,
¶¶ 11-15; Serlin Decl., ¶¶ 4-5.)  The Court’s determination in this  regard also has been informed by the Court’s own
experience as an appellate practitioner in Los Angeles. 
 
As to hours
billed by Albers and Serlin, Plaintiffs object to “approximately 27 hours
reviewing the Clerk’s Transcript and preparing the Statement of Facts,”
“approximately 75 hours . . . on the preparation of the Opening Brief,” 26.3
hours preparing for oral argument and over 12 hours preparing an Answer to
Petition for Review. (Opposition, pp. 7-8.)   In Reply, Moving Defendants reiterate that “this
was a large record appeal which included an 8-volume clerk’s transcript and a
1-volume augmentation” and that as noted by the Court of Appeal, Plaintiffs’
opening brief was “deficient.” (Reply, p. 4.)   The Court agrees with the Moving Defendants
and finds that their appellate attorneys’ hours were reasonable.
