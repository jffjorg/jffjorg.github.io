And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied Shirazi's motion to compel an appraisal in this insurance dispute. The Judge found that Shirazi waived his right to an appraisal by unreasonably delaying in requesting one. The Court concluded that Shirazi's delay in requesting an appraisal was unreasonable because he waited nearly three-and-a-half years after making his initial request for an appraisal, and he never responded to CAIC's requests for clarification regarding his appraisal demand. The Court also found that Shirazi's actions in conducting the litigation appeared to be entirely inconsistent with the exercise of his appraisal rights. The Judge noted that the litigation machinery had been substantially invoked, and Shirazi's delay in moving to compel an appraisal misled, affected, and prejudiced CAIC.
