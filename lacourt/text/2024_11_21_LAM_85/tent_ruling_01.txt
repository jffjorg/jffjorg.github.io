Chol
Enterprises, Inc. v. 740 South Broadway Associates, LLC, 
23STCV31162


Tentative decision on motion to reduce
right to attach order:  denied




 



Cross-Defendant Erik Chol (“Chol”) moves to reduce the right
to attach order granted to Defendant/Cross-Defendant 740 South Broadway
Associates, LLC (“740 LLC”) from $274,955.55 to $17,422.25, as well as to release
the attached Assessor Parcel Number 4159-028-012. 
The court has read and considered the moving papers and opposition
(no reply was filed) and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
A. Statement of
the Case
1. Second Amended Complaint
Plaintiff Chol Enterprises, Inc. (“Chol Inc.”), commenced
this action on December 21, 2023.  The
operative pleading is the Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”), filed on July 1,
2024, against Defendant/Cross-Complainant 740 LLC, Houman Sarshar (“Sarshar”), and
Globe Theater Entertainment, Inc. (“Globe Inc.”), alleging causes of action for
(1) breach of contract, (2) trespass to chattels, (3) conversion, and (4)
unfair competition under Business and Professions Code section 17200.  The SAC alleges in pertinent part as follows.
Chol Inc.’s headquarters and principal place of business is
located at the Globe Theatre at 740 South Broadway, Los Angeles, CA 90014 (the
“Property”).  Compl., ¶1.
On October 10, 2012, Chol Inc. entered a commercial tenancy
with 740 LLC for the Property.  Compl.,
¶19.
On May 17, 2022, Chol Inc. agreed to transfer the Trademark
of the “Globe Theatre” to 740 LLC, at the direction of Sarshar, as part of a
Settlement Agreement between Chol Inc. and 740 LLC.  Compl., ¶20, Ex. E.
On November 11, 2023, Chol Inc. received an eviction notice
of the Property.  Compl., ¶21, Ex. F.
On November 14, 2023, Plaintiff's CEO, Chol, spoke with 740
LLC’s agent and manager, Sarshar, and they orally agreed that Chol Inc. would have
until December 13, 2023, to vacate its belongings from the Property.  Compl., ¶22. 

On November 27, 2023, 740 LLC changed the locks and brought
a security guard with a dog to the Property, withholding Chol Inc.’s access to its
belongings and making it impracticable and/or impossible for Chol Inc. to
fulfill its obligations under the November 14 oral agreement.  Compl., ¶23. 

On December 4, 2023, Chol Inc. and Sarshar, accompanied by
their respective counsel met at the Property to take inventory of Chol Inc.’s
personal belongings to be vacated. 
Compl., ¶24, Ex. G.  Such personal
belongings include chandeliers, stage barriers, station posts, audio-visual
equipment, lighting equipment except walking lights, liquor inventory from bar
areas, music speakers throughout the premises (but not speakers related to any
public announcement, PA, fire life safety or alarm systems), other equipment
affixed to the walls, LED video screens, refrigerators and icemakers, stage
platform, non-mounted and freestanding framed mirrors, free-standing tables,
chairs, special effect equipment, free-standing shelving units, CO2
tanks and syrups, POS systems, disco balls throughout the theatre, projectors,
wall sconces and mirrors in downstairs women’s restroom, laundry room items
except sinks and plumbing fixtures, personal property in the downstairs kitchen
area except the sink and plumbing fixtures, personal items from cold storage
area except sink and plumbing fixtures, loose furniture except couches and
other items which are covered in red velvet, personal belongings in the office
area of the premises, CCTV and video equipment, Certificate of Insurance, Chol
Inc.’s cash in the amount of $15,000 and accompanying registers, and
third-party belongings, including employees’ paychecks and tips, suppliers’
rental equipment, and cleaning company supplies and machines (collectively,
“Belongings”).  Compl., ¶24.  
In addition, to cure the fact that 740 LLC made the November
14, 2023 agreement impractical and/or impossible for Chol Inc. to perform, Chol
Inc. and 740 LLC orally agreed that Chol Inc.’s five HVAC compressors outside
the venue could stay in place in lieu of any storage fees for Chol Inc.’s
Belongings.  Compl., ¶24.
On the same day, 740 LLC and Sarshar unilaterally sought
from Chol Inc. a storage fee of $28,000, in addition to a daily fee of $2,000
($500 of which affords 740 LLC’s daily security), both effective December 16,
2023, in contravention of the agreement entered into earlier that day.  Compl., ¶25. 
740 LLC and Sarshar also unilaterally sought to keep all of Chol Inc.’s Belongings
that were nailed to the wall, including Chol Inc.’s equipment and a Certificate
of Insurance that listed 740 LLC as an additional insured.  Compl., ¶25.
On or about December 7, 2023, 740 LLC and Sarshar executed
an “Exclusive Leasing Listing Agreement” with Kennedy Wilson Brokerage
allegedly listing the Property for lease. 
Compl., ¶26, Ex. H.  In the
brochure, the broker listed the Property as “Move-in ready, fully equipped
multi-level theatre with dance floor, mezzanine, dressing and press rooms and
numerous bars.”  Compl., ¶26.
On March 25, 2024, 740 LLC and Sarshar leased the Globe
Theatre to another party.  Compl., ¶27,
Ex. I.
On May 15, 2024, Defendants held and participated in an
online auction of Chol Inc.’s Belongings. 
Compl., ¶29.
On June 24, 2024, Chol, Inc. discovered a new entity, GTE,
created by Sarshar.  Compl., ¶30, Ex.
K.  GTE was created by Sarshar as a new
entity to run the Globe Theatre.  Compl.,
¶30.  It also was created to hold the
Belongings of Chol Inc. and use them for its own benefit and profit.  Compl., ¶30. 
As of the filing of this complaint, Chol Inc.’s Belongings
remain inaccessible to and withheld from Plaintiff and, upon information and
belief, are located at the Property in use by Sarshar and GTE.  Compl., ¶31.
Chol Inc. seeks (1) equitable relief granting Chol Inc.
access to Belongings; (2) compensatory damages including but not limited to
accruing rental fees for unreturned sound equipment ($540,000 as of the filing
of the Complaint) and the fair market value of Belongings not returned; (3)
attorney’s fees and costs; (4) pre-and-post-judgment interest on all sums
allowed by law; (5) reasonably foreseeable consequential damages as to the
second and third causes of action; and (6) punitive damages as to the second
and third causes of action.  Compl., at
p. 18:4-14.
 
2. Shine FX’s First Amended Cross-Complaint
On May 31, 2024, Cross-Defendant Shine FX Production Inc.
(“Shine FX”) filed the operative First Amended Cross-Complaint (“FACC”) against
740 LLC and Sarshar, alleging causes of action for trespass to chattels,
conversion, replevin (claim and delivery), and intentional interference with
contractual relations.  The FACC alleges
in pertinent part as follows.
Shine FX is a California corporation formed on January 1,
2020, for the purpose of event production and conducting sound equipment
renting business.  FACC ¶13.  Shine FX has collaborated with Chol Inc. as
its third-party vendor.  FACC ¶¶14-15.  Shine FX supplied equipment to Chol Inc. at
the Property during the period of December 2021 through November 2023.  FACC ¶20, Ex. C.  
Shine FX has never entered into any type of agreement with
740 LLC, has not been involved in the commercial lease dispute between Chol
Inc. and 740 LLC, and has no connection to the unlawful detainer proceedings
against Chol Inc.  FACC ¶¶17-19.
On January 12, 2023, Shine FX and Chol Inc. entered into an
Asset Purchase Agreement wherein Chol Inc. transferred to Shine FX Air Motion
Void Acoustic Speakers, Air Ten Void Acoustic Speakers, Amplifiers Power Soft,
Void Acoustic Subbass Cabinet, and Sun Strip LED Bar (“Equipment”) with a total
value of $53,907.  FACC ¶23, Ex. E.  In exchange for the Belongings, Shine FX
installed, tunned, and rigged the new LED immersive video wall and lasers,
blinders, movers, atomic strobes, CO2 jets, and fire flames FX.  FACC ¶23, Ex. F. 
Shine FX’s Equipment was rented to Chol Inc. and has been
unlawfully locked within the Property, with Chol Inc. owing Shine FX $2,575 per
day in late fees for not returning the Equipment in a timely fashion.  FACC ¶21, Ex. D.  740 LLC has been wrongfully preventing Shine
FX from retrieving the Equipment.  FACC
¶¶24-26, Ex. G.
As of the filing of the FACC, Shine FX and Chol have no
information regarding the location of the Equipment illicitly seized by
Cross-Defendants.  FACC ¶41.
Shine FX seeks: (1) equitable relief granting it access to its
Equipment; (2) compensatory damages including but not limited to accruing
rental fees for unreturned sound equipment ($481,525) as of the filing of this FACC)
and the fair market value of Equipment not returned; (3) attorney’s fees and
costs; (4) pre-and-post-judgment interest; (5) reasonably foreseeable
consequential damages; and (6) punitive damages.  FACC at 12.
 
3. 740 LLC’s First Amended Cross-Complaint 
On June 21, 2024, Defendant 740 LLC filed the operative
First Amended Cross-Complaint (“740FACC”) against Cross-Defendants Chol Inc.,
Chol, Shine FX, and Florence Chol (“Mrs. Chol”), alleging causes of action for
breach of amended lease, rent and damages – Civil Code Section 1951.2, breach
of written guarantee, community property obligation, open book account, account
stated, unjust enrichment, violation of Civil Code section 3439.04(a)(1),
fraudulent transfer in violation of Civil Code section 3439.04(a)(2)(A), and declaratory
relief.  The 740FACC alleges in pertinent
part as follows. 
On or about October 12, 2012, Chol Inc. and 740 LLC entered
into a Standard Industrial/Commercial Multi-Tenant Lease (the “Lease”),
creating a tenancy for the Property.  FACC
¶10, Ex. A.
On or around October 16, 2012, to induce 740 LLC to enter
into the Lease and to extend credit, Chol signed a written Guaranty of Lease,
personally guaranteeing the indebtedness of Chol Inc. relating to the amounts
due 740 LLC under the Lease (the “Guaranty”). 
FACC ¶11, Ex. B. 
On or about January 15, 2014, Chol Inc. and 740 LLC entered
into an agreement titled First Amendment to Amended Lease and Consent of
Guarantor (the “First Amendment”), amending the Lease.  FACC ¶12, Ex. C.
On or about April 7, 2022, Chol Inc. and 740 LLC entered
into an agreement titled Second Amendment to Lease and Consent of Guarantor
(the “Second Amendment”), further amending the Lease.  FACC ¶13, Ex. D.
The obligations of Chol Inc. under the Lease, as amended by
the First Amendment and the Second Amendment (collectively, the “Amended
Lease”) are personally guaranteed by Chol under the terms of the Guaranty and
further to the Consent of Guarantor obtained in connection with the Amended
Lease.  FACC ¶14.  
There was previously a civil action between 740 LLC, Chol
Inc., and Chol entitled Chol Enterprises, Inc. v. 740 Broadway Associates,
LLC, et al. 21STCV39031 (the “Civil Action”).  FACC ¶16.  740 LLC also filed an unlawful detainer action
entitled 740 Broadway Associates, LLC, et al. v. Chol Enterprises, Inc.,
22STCV01203 (the “Unlawful Detainer Action”). The parties resolved the Civil
Action and the Eviction Action through a Settlement Agreement and Release dated
on or about April 7, 2022 (the “Settlement Agreement”).  FACC ¶17, Ex. E.  
Under Section 6(a) of the Settlement Agreement, 740 LLC, Chol
Inc and Eric Chol agreed that 740 LLC “shall be entitled to a Judgment for the
unpaid amount of the Stipulated Debt and for immediate possession of the
Premises upon it being shown…that [Choi Inc. has] failed to timely perform one
or more of [its] obligations contemplated by Section 2, 3, 4 and 6(c) of this
Agreement…”  FACC ¶18.  
Cross-Defendants defaulted under the Settlement Agreement.  FACC ¶19. 
Thereafter, 740 LLC brought a motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement
and sought judgment for the unpaid amount of the Stipulated Debt and for
immediate possession of the Premises. 
FACC ¶¶19-20, Ex. F.  On or about
August 29, 2023, the court entered judgment in the Unlawful Detainer Action
finding, inter alia, that 740 LLC was entitled to possession of the Property
and a money judgment for the Stipulated Debt. 
FACC ¶21, Ex. G.  The court
amended the Judgment on February 22, 2024 to include an award of fees and cost
incurred relative to the Stipulated Debt and recovery of possession of the Property.  FACC ¶21, Ex. H.  
Pursuant to a lock-out order obtained in connection with the
judgment, the Los Angeles County Sheriff (“Sheriff”) forcibly evicted Chol Inc.
from the Property on or about November 29, 2023.  FACC ¶22. 

As of the date of this filing, Chol Inc. is also indebted to
740 LLC for unpaid rent occurring after April 7, 2022 and damages for breaches
of Chol Inc.’s Lease Repair Obligations as specified in the Lease and amended
by the Second Amendment.  FACC ¶23, Ex.
D.
The Amended Lease provides that Chol Inc. shall pay 740 LLC a
late charge on any monetary amount owed by Chol Inc. that is not paid when due.  FACC ¶24. 
Such late charges have accrued and continue to accrue and 740 LLC is
entitled to them as damages under this Cross-Complaint in an amount according
to proof.  FACC ¶24.
Under the Amended Lease, any monetary amount owed by Chol
Inc. shall bear interest from and after the date such payment is due until
paid.  FACC ¶25.  Such interest has now accrued and continue to
accrue and 740 LLC is entitled to the same as damages under this
Cross-Complaint in an amount according to proof.  FACC ¶25.
The Amended Lease and the Guaranty both provide that in any
action between the parties to those documents, the prevailing party shall be
entitled to seek recovery of such party’s reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.  FACC ¶26. 
Chol Inc. has breached the Amended Lease, and Chol has breached the
Guaranty, and 740 LLC has been compelled to retain counsel and to commence this
action to enforce its rights under those documents.  FACC ¶26.
740 LLC seeks (1) damages pursuant to the Amended Lease
according to proof and no less than $1,450,000, (2) reasonable attorney’s fees
and costs, (3) declaration that the interests of Chol and Mrs. Chol in the Chol
Living Trust under the Instrument dated August 25, 2016 are liable for the
debts of Chol pursuant to his Guaranty and are community property, (4)
post-judgment interest at the maximum legal rate and (5) other and further
relief the court may deem just and proper. 
FACC at 19-20.

against Defendant 740 LLC. 
On January 3, 2024, the court denied Chol Inc.’s ex parte

On August 22, 2024, the court granted 740 Lc’s right to

B. Applicable Law
Attachment is a
prejudgment remedy providing for the seizure of one or more of the defendant’s
assets to aid in the collection of a money demand pending the outcome of the
trial of the action.  See Whitehouse
v. Six Corporation, (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 527, 533.  In 1972, and in a 1977 comprehensive
revision, the Legislature enacted attachment legislation (CCP §481.010 et seq.)
that meets the due process requirements set forth in Randone v. Appellate
Department, (1971) 5 Cal.3d 536.  See
Western Steel & Ship Repair v. RMI, (12986) 176 Cal.App.3d 1108,
1115.  As the attachment statutes are
purely the creation of the Legislature, they are strictly construed.  Vershbow v. Reiner, (1991) 231
Cal.App.3d 879, 882.
A writ of attachment
may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for money, each of which
is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the total amount of the
claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount not less than five hundred
dollars ($500).  CCP §483.010(a).  A claim is “readily ascertainable” where the
amount due may be clearly ascertained from the contract and calculated by
evidence; the fact that damages are unliquidated is not determinative.  CIT Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v.
Super DVD, Inc., (“CIT”) (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 537, 540-41
(attachment appropriate for claim based on rent calculation for lease of
commercial equipment).
The court may issue
a right to attach order (Optional Form AT-120) if the plaintiff shows all of
the following: (1) the claim on which the attachment is based is one on which
an attachment may be issued (CCP §484.090(a)(1)); (2) the plaintiff has established
the probable validity of the claim (CCP §484.090(a)(2)); (3) attachment is
sought for no purpose other than the recovery on the subject claim (CCP
§484.090(a)(3); and (4) the amount to be secured by the attachment is greater
than zero (CCP §484.090(a)(4)).  
“Any defendant whose
property has been attached pursuant to a writ issued under this chapter [Ex Parte
Hearing Procedure for obtaining Writ of Attachment] may apply for an order (1)
that the right to attach order be set aside, the writ of attachment quashed,
and any property levied upon pursuant to the writ be released, or (2) that the
amount to be secured by the attachment be reduced….”  CCP §485.240(a). 
The grounds for a
motion to discharge an attachment include (1) the case is not one in which
attachment may properly issue, (2) failure of the complaint, tested by pleading
rules, to state any cause of action; (3) defects in the undertaking or
affidavit; or (4) issuance of the writ for an amount greater than stated in the
affidavit.  Burke v. Superior Court of Sacramento County, 71 Cal.2d
276, 279 (1969).  
“If the court finds
that plaintiff is not entitled to the right to attach order, it shall order the
right to attach order set aside, the writ of attachment quashed, and any
property levied on pursuant to the writ released.”  CCP §485.240(c).    
 
C. Statement of Facts
1. Chol’s Evidence[2]
On October 10, 2012,
Chol Inc. entered into the Lease.  Chol
Ex. A.  Cross-Defendant Chol personally
guaranteed the Lease.  Ex. A, pp. 78-79.  The Lease term was through December 31, 2019,
with option(s) to extend.  Chol Ex.
A.  
Per the “Option(s)
to Extend” Addendum:
 
“In order to exercise an option to extend, Lessee must give written
notice of such election to Lessor and Lessor must receive the same at least 9
but not more than 12 months prior to the date that the option period would
commence, time being of the essence. If proper notification of the exercise of
an option is not given and/or received, such option shall automatically expire.”  Chol Ex. A, p.39.  
 
On January 15, 2014,
Chol Inc. and 740 LLC entered into the First Amendment to the Lease.  Chol Ex. B.  The First Amendment provided for a First
Option Period (wrongly referred to as a “Second Option Period”) for a duration
of 36 months from November 1, 2019 through October 31, 2022.  The First Amendment also provided for a
Second Option Period for a duration of sixty (60) months from November 1, 2022
through October 31, 2027, p. 88.  Chol
Ex. B.   
On April 7, 2022,
740 LLC, Sarshar, and Chol Inc. entered into the Settlement Agreement.  Chol Ex. C. 
The Settlement noted that the Civil Action and the Unlawful
Detainer Action were pending between the parties and the Settlement Agreement would
settle both.  Ex. C, p. 108.
Also on April 7,
2022, Chol Inc. and 740 LLC entered the Second Amendment to the Lease.  Chol Ex. D. 
The Second Amendment provided for the same Second Option Period as in
the First Amendment with a duration of 60 months from November 1, 2022 through
October 31, 2027.  Chol Ex. D.  
Paragraph 3(c)(i) of
the Second Amendment states: 
 
“Lessee asserts, and Lessor disputes that Lessee has duly and timely
exercised Lessee’s renewal option with regard to the Second Option Period. In
that regard, the Parties agree that provided that Lessee timely performs all of
the obligations of Lessee as detailed in Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Settlement
Agreement, then Lessee shall be deemed to have duly exercised Lessee’s renewal
option with regard to the Second Option Period.”  Chol Ex. D, p. 99.
 
On August 1, 2023,
740 LLC brought a motion in the Unlawful Detainer Action to enforce the Settlement
Agreement.  Chol Ex. E.  On August 28, 2023, the court granted the
motion.  Chol Ex. E.  On August 29, 2023, the court granted
judgment in favor of 740 LLC in the Unlawful Detainer Action.  Chol Ex. F. 

On September 5,
2023, 740 LLC filed an Application for issuance of a writ of execution in the
Unlawful Detainer Action.  Chol Ex.
G.   
On September 6,
2023, the court in the Unlawful Detainer Action issued a writ of possession of real
property to 740 LLC.  Chol Ex. H.  
On November 2, 2023,
the Sheriff served Chol with a five-day notice to vacate the Property.  Chol Exs. I, J.  Per the Notice to Vacate, Chol was required to
vacate the premises by November 7, 2023. 
Chol Ex. I.  
On November 27,
2023, the Sheriff posted a Notice of Eviction at the Globe Theatre.  Chol Ex. J. 

On August 23, 2024, the
court granted 740 LLC’s application for a right to attach order against Chol in
the amount of $274,955.55.  Chol Set
Aside, Ex. K.  
On October 2, 2024,
740 LLC filed and recorded a Notice of Attachment for Chol’s home at 807 Meyer
Lane, Redondo Beach, CA 90278.  Chol Ex.
L.  
 
D. Analysis
            Cross-Defendant
Chol applies for an order reducing the amount to be secured by attachment from $274,955.55 to $17,422.25 and to release
attached property exceeding the $17,422.25 amount.
 
1.     
Procedural
Defect
Attachment is wholly a statutory scheme, and there is no statutory
authority authorizing a motion to reduce the amount of a right to attach order
granted after a noticed motion.  Chol
relies on CCP section 485.240, but it expressly only applies to attachment upon
an ex parte application. “There is no equivalent procedure available for
setting aside a [right to attach order] or writ of attachment issued after
noticed hearing.” Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil
Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group), 9:924.
Nor would Chol be aided if his application were deemed a
motion for reconsideration.   A motion for
reconsideration must be brought within ten days of the ruling. CCP §1008(a).  The right to attach order was granted on
August 23, 2024, or 47 days before Chol filed his application.
Chol’s application
is procedurally defective and is denied on that basis.
 
            2. Merits
            If, arguendo, the
court should consider the application, it would be denied.  
 
a. Notice
Chol argues that Chol
Inc. did not validly exercise the amended Lease’s Second Option Period because
the timing and manner of its notice did not comply with the strict requirements
of the Option to Extend Addendum.  “In order to avail himself of the right to
renew a lease as provided for by a lease option, a tenant must apprise the
lessor in unequivocal terms of his unqualified intention to exercise his
option, within the time, in the manner and on the terms stated in the lease.”
42 Cal.Jur.3d, Land Law and Tenant, § 291, p. 328; Hayward Lbr. &
Inv. Co. v. Const. Prod. Corp., (1953) 117 Cal.App.2d 221, 227–28. 
The Option to Extend Addendum explicitly states: “In order
to exercise an option to extend, Lessee must give written notice of such
election to Lessor and Lessor must receive the same at least 9 but not more
than 12 months prior to the date that the option period would commence, time
being of the essence.” Ex. A, p. 28.  The
Second Option Period was to commence on November 1, 2022 and the notice was
required to be given no later than February 1, 2022.  App. at 5.
The notice was untimely as 740 LLC contended in the April 7,
2022 settlement Agreement: “Lessee asserts, and Lessor disputes that Lessee has
duly and timely exercised Lessee’s renewal option with regard to the Second
Option Period.”  Ex. D, p. 192. This
language clearly establishes that no valid notice had been given by Chol Inc.
as of April 7, 2022, rendering the Second Option Period inapplicable.  Any rent calculated under the disputed Second
Option Period is void, and Erik Chol, as a guarantor, cannot be held
accountable for rent purportedly owed under a lease term that no longer
exists.  App. at 5-6.
Chol is looking at the wrong document.  The Option to Extend Addendum’s notice
requirements were superseded by the April
7, 2022 Settlement Agreement (Chol Ex. C) and the Second Amendment (Chol Ex.
D).  The Second Amendment provided for
the same Second Option Period as in the First Amendment, for a duration of 60
months from November 1, 2022 through October 31, 2027.  Chol Ex. D. 
Paragraph 3(c)(i) of the Second Amendment states: 
 
“Lessee asserts, and Lessor disputes that Lessee has duly and timely
exercised Lessee’s renewal option with regard to the Second Option Period. In
that regard, the Parties agree that provided that Lessee timely performs all of
the obligations of Lessee as detailed in Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Settlement
Agreement, then Lessee shall be deemed to have duly exercised Lessee’s
renewal option with regard to the Second Option Period.”  Chol Ex. D, p. 99 (emphasis added).
 
In Paragraph 3(c)(i), 740 LLC clearly forgives any untimely
or improper exercise of the Second Option Period so long as Chol Inc. complies
with sections 2, 3, and 4.   
 
b. Conditions Precedent
            Chol
argues that, if Chol Inc. timely noticed the Second Option Period, the renewal
option would still be invalid because Chol Inc. failed to satisfy the condition
precedents set forth in the Second Amended Lease.  As such, the Second Option Period was never
effectively exercised, and the calculation of rent based on that period remains
improper.  App. at 6.  
Chol contends that Sections 2, 3, and 4 required Chol Inc.
to make timely payment of the Settlement Amount, obtain adequate insurance
coverage, and complete specific construction and repair obligations.  Ex. C, pp. 86–87.  The undisputed evidence shows that these
conditions were not fulfilled within the designated timeframe, as confirmed by
740 LLC’s motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement the Unlawful Detainer
Action (Ex. E), and court’s subsequent order finding Chol Inc. in breach of
these obligations (Ex. F). Because the specific obligations under Sections 2,
3, and 4 of the Settlement Agreement were not met, the conditions precedent to
exercising the Second Option Period were not satisfied. Consequently, the
Second Option Period was never validly exercised.  App. at 7.
Absent a Second Option Period, Chol Inc.’s tenancy was
month-to-month once 740 LLC accepted rent on November 1, 2022.  See Civil Code §1945.  The First Option Period terminated on October
31, 2022.  After this termination, Chol
Inc. continued to occupy the premises without a new option period in effect,
and 740 LLC’s acceptance of rent on November 1, 2022 legally transformed the
tenancy into a month-to-month periodic tenancy. 
Therefore, the attachment amount of $274,955.55 sought by 740 LLC is
inflated due to the inclusion of rent for periods that Chol Inc. was not
obligated to pay.  See Chol Ex. M.
The correct amount is $17,422.25.  Chol
Ex. N.  Mot. at 9. 
            This
argument is untenable.  Paragraph 3(c)(i)
of the Second Amendment and Paragraph 39 of the Lease both exist for the
benefit of 740 LLC and may be enforced or waived at its election.  See Bank of America v. Moore,
(1937) 18 Cal.App.2d 522, 526.  Neither
Chol nor Chol Inc. can end the Lease as extended by refusing to perform a required
condition.  Any forfeiture of the lease occurs
at the election of lessor.  Id. at
526.
740 LLC also points out that the language of Paragraph
3(c)(i) does not provide that the renewal option is void ab initio if
Chol Inc. does not perform the conditions precedent.  It merely states that Chol Inc. shall be
deemed to have duly exercised the Second Option Period if the condition is
performed.  Therefore, Paragraph 3(c)(i)
gives 740 LLC the option to accept or reject the exercise of the option even if
Chol Inc. is in breach.  Chol Inc. does
not have the power to waive this breach, only 740 LLC does:
 
“The rule that the
provision that a default shall make the contract null and void is not to be
understood as a favor to the defaulting party, [and] is not the rule of this
state… The provision that the agreement should terminate on the failure of
Lessees to perform those conditions of the lease which were obligatory to be
carried out on their part is a covenant in favor of Lessors exclusively, and
does not make the lease void except at their [lessors’] option… [A] clause in a
lease that it shall be null and void on the failure of Lessee to pay rent or
keep other covenants is not self-operating so as to make the lease void ipso
facto by the default, but, being a provision for the benefit of Lessor, may be
enforced or waived at his [lessor’s] option….”  Bank of America v. Moore, supra, 18
Cal.App.2d at 527-28 (emphasis added).
 
740 LLC states that it elected to  waive any forfeiture based on a claim that
the option was untimely exercised and elected instead to continue the Lease.  Opp. at 8-9. 
The attachment amount was properly calculated.[3]
 
            E. Conclusion
            Chol’s
application to reduce the amount of attachment is both procedurally and
substantively defective and is denied.
