And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving Chol Inc. and 740 LLC. Chol Inc. had requested the court to judicially notice all pleadings and documents in the case, as well as all pleadings and documents in the Unlawful Detainer Action. The court denied this request, explaining that a judge can always look at the case file without the need for judicial notice. However, the court did consider Chol Inc.'s exhibits from the Unlawful Detainer Action. 740 LLC, on the other hand, requested that the court judicially notice Chol Inc.'s opposition to the motion to enforce settlement in the Unlawful Detainer Action, and this request was granted. Finally, the court ruled that it need not consider 740 LLC's estoppel argument.
