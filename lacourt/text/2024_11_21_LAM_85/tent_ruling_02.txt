The following list does not include the parties’ various demurrers.


[2]
Chol requests the court to judicially notice (1) all pleadings in this case and
(2) all pleadings in the Unlawful Detainer Action.  There is no need to judicially notice
documents in the case file; a judge can always look at the instant file.   Chol’s request to judicially notice
documents from the Unlawful Detainer Action does not comply with CRC 3.1113(l)
and 3.1306(c) by providing the court with copies and is denied.  Nonetheless, the court has considered Chol’s
exhibits from the Unlawful Detainer Action.
740 LLC requests the court to judicially notice Chol Inc.’s
opposition to the motion to enforce settlement in the Unlawful Detainer Action
(Ex. A).  The request is granted.   Evid. Code §452(d).


[3]
The court need not consider 740 LLC’s estoppel argument.  Opp. at 9-10.
