Daimler Truck Financial Services
USA v. Alex Truck Company and Alejandro Lopez, 24STLC04522 

Tentative decision on application for
writ of possession: granted




 



Plaintiff Daimler Truck Financial Services (“DTFS”) seeks a
writ of possession against Defendants Alex Truck Company (“ATC”) and Alejandro
Lopez (“Lopez”).     
The court has read and considered the moving papers (no
opposition was filed) and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
A. Statement of
the Case
1. Complaint 
On June 24, 2024, Plaintiff DTFS filed the Complaint against
Defendants ATC and Lopez alleging claims for breach of contract, claim and
delivery, conversion, common count, and breach of guaranty. 
On or about June 21, 2021, ATC, through its president, Lopez,
and The Around The Clock Freightliner Group, LLC (“Seller”) entered into a
written California Retail Installment Contract (“Agreement”) in the original
principal amount of $37,161.88, for ATC to borrow funds to purchase a 2022
COMERCIALIZADORA NIM MKA SA DE CV DRY VAN TRAILER, Serial No. 3ELDTMS43N6000304
(“Trailer”).  Pursuant to the Agreement,
ATC agreed to pay 60 consecutive monthly payments of $862.65 commencing August
5, 2021, and monthly thereafter on the 5th day of each successive month until
all unpaid principal and interest were paid in full.  Default Interest was payable at the rate of
18.0% per annum.  
To induce Plaintiff to extend credit to ATC, Defendant Lopez,
for valuable consideration, on June 21, 2021, executed and delivered to
Plaintiff, a written Continuing Personal Guaranty (“Guaranty”).  Pursuant to the terms of the Guaranty, Lopez
unconditionally guaranteed prompt and full payment of any and all indebtedness
of ATC, including payment of attorneys’ fees and court costs incurred by
Plaintiff to enforce payment under the Guaranty.  
Plaintiff was thereafter received by assignment and
perfected its lienholder interest in the Trailer by obtaining a lienholder
interest from the Department of Motor Vehicles (“DMV”).  
On November 30, 2021, Mercedes-Benz Financial Services USA
LLC ("MBFS") and DTFS entered into a transaction (the “Transaction”)
whereby MBFS sold to DTFS all of its rights and obligations with respect to all
litigation or claims exclusively related to or arising in connection with
MBFS’s financial services business in the United States related to the
wholesale and retail financing of trucks and buses.  As a result of the Transaction, DTFS is now
the proper party in interest in this and other assigned contracts. 
On or about May 5, 2023, ATC and Lopez defaulted under the
terms and conditions of the Agreement and the Guaranty by failing to make the
payment then due and owing. 
 
2. Course of Proceedings 
On June 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed the Complaint. 
On September 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed the Application for
Writ of Possession.  
Defendants were served with the Summons, Complaint, and
moving papers by substituted service on September 9, 2024, with service
effective on September 19, 2024. 
 
B. Applicable Law
A writ of possession is issued as a provisional remedy in a
cause of action for claim and delivery, also known as replevin.  See
Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro v. Schectman, (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1279,
1288.  As a provisional remedy, the right
to possession is only temporary, and title and the right to possess are
determined in the final judgment.  
            A
writ of possession is available in any pending action.  It also is available where an action has been
stayed pending arbitration, so long as the arbitration award may be ineffectual
without provisional relief.  See CCP §1281.7. 
 
            1. Procedure
            Upon
the filing of the complaint or at any time thereafter, a plaintiff may apply
for an order for a writ of possession. 
Unlike attachment, where Judicial Council forms are optional, the
parties must use the mandatory approved Judicial Council forms in a claim and
delivery proceeding.  (Judicial Council
Forms CD-100 et seq.).
            A
plaintiff must make a written application for a writ of possession.  CCP §512.010(a), (b); (Mandatory Form
CD-100); CCP §512.010(a).  A verified
complaint alone is insufficient.  6
Witkin, California Procedure, (5th ed. 2008) §255, p.203.  The application may be supported by
declarations and/or a verified complaint. 
CCP §516.030.  The declarations or
complaint must set forth admissible evidence except where expressly permitted
to be shown on information and belief.  Id.
            The
application must be executed under oath and include: (1) A showing of the basis
of the plaintiff's claim and that the plaintiff is entitled to possession of
the property claimed.  If the plaintiff's
claim is based on a written instrument, a copy of it must be attached; (2) A
showing that the property is wrongfully detained by the defendant, how the
defendant came into possession of it, and, the reasons for the detention based
on the plaintiff’s best knowledge, information, and belief; (3) A specific description
of the property and statement of its value; (4) The location of the property
according to the plaintiff’s best knowledge, information, and belief.  If the property, or some part of it, is
within a private place which may have to be entered to take possession, a
showing of probable cause to believe that the property is located there; and
(5) A statement that the property has not been taken for (a) a tax, assessment,
or fine, pursuant to a statute, or (b) an execution against the plaintiff’s
property.  Alternatively, a statement
that if the property was seized for one of these purposes, it is by statute
exempt from such seizure.  CCP
§512.010(b).
 
            2. The Hearing
            Before
noticing a hearing, the plaintiff must serve the defendant with all of the
following: (1) A copy of the summons and complaint; (2) A Notice of Application
and Hearing; and (3) A copy of the application and any supporting declaration.  CCP §512.030(a).  If the defendant has not appeared in the
action, service must be made in the same manner as service of summons and
complaint.  CCP §512.030(b).
            Each
party shall file with the court and serve upon the other party any declarations
and points and authorities intended to be relied upon at the hearing.  CCP §512.050. 
At the hearing, the court decides the merits of the application based on
the pleadings and declarations.   Id.  Upon a showing of good cause, the court may
receive and consider additional evidence and authority presented at the hearing
or may continue the hearing for the production of such additional evidence,
oral or documentary, or the filing of other affidavits or points and
authorities.  Id.  
            The
court may order issuance of a writ of possession if both of the following are
found: (1) The plaintiff has established the probable validity of the
plaintiff’s claim to possession of the property; and (2) The undertaking
requirements of CCP section 515.010 are satisfied.  CCP §512.060(a).  “A claim has ‘probable validity’ where it is
more likely than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the
defendant on that claim.”  CCP
§511.090.  This requires that the
plaintiff establish a prima facie case; the writ shall not issue if the
defendant shows a reasonable probability of a successful defense to the claim
and delivery cause of action.  Witkin,
California Procedure, (5th ed. 2008) §261, p.208.  A defendant’s claim of defect in the property
is not a defense to the plaintiff’s right to possess it.  RCA Service Co. v. Superior Court,
(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 1, 3.
            No
writ directing the levying officer to enter a private place to take possession
of any property may be issued unless the plaintiff has established that there
is probable cause to believe that the property is located there.  CCP §512.060(b).  
            The
successful plaintiff may obtain a preliminary injunction containing the same
provisions as a TRO that remains in effect until the property is seized by the
levying officer.[1]  CCP §513.010(c).  
            The
court may also issue a “turnover order” directing the defendant to transfer
possession of the property to the plaintiff (See Mandatory Form CD-120). 
The order must notify the defendant that failure to comply may subject
him or her to contempt of court.  CCP
§512.070.  The turnover remedy is not
issued in lieu of a writ, but in conjunction with it to provide the plaintiff
with a less expensive means of obtaining possession.  See
Edwards v Superior Court, (“Edwards”) (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 173,
178.
 
            3. The Plaintiff’s Undertaking
            Generally,
the court cannot issue an order for a writ of possession until the plaintiff
has filed an undertaking with the court (Mandatory Form CD-140 for personal
sureties).  CCP §515.010(a).  The undertaking shall provide that the
sureties are bound to the defendant for the return of the property to the
defendant, if return of the property is ordered, and for the payment to the
defendant of any sum recovered against the plaintiff.  Id. 
The undertaking shall be in an amount not less than twice the value of
the defendant's interest in the property or in a greater amount.  Id. 
The value of the defendant's interest in the property is determined by
the market value of the property less the amount due and owing on any
conditional sales contract or security agreement and all liens and encumbrances
on the property, and any other factors necessary to determine the defendant’s
interest in the property.  Id.
            However,
where the defendant has no interest in the property, the court must waive the requirement
of the plaintiff’s undertaking and include in the order for issuance of the
writ the amount of the defendant’s undertaking sufficient to satisfy the
requirements of CCP section 515.020(b).  CCP
§515.010(b).

The Agreement
            On
or about June 21, 2021, ATC, by its president, Lopez, and Seller entered into
the Agreement, in the principal amount of $37,161.88, to borrow funds to
purchase the Trailer.  Williams Decl.,
¶12; Williams Decl., Ex. 1.   Pursuant to the Agreement, ATC agreed to pay
60 consecutive monthly payments of $862.65 each commencing August 5, 2021, and
monthly thereafter on the 5th day of each successive month until all unpaid
principal and interest were paid in full. Default Interest was payable at the
rate of 18.0% per annum pursuant to the Agreement.  Williams Decl., ¶13.  
            To
induce MBFS to extend credit to ATC, Defendant Lopez, for valuable
consideration, on June 21, 2021, executed and delivered a Guaranty.  Williams Decl., ¶14; Williams Decl., Ex.
2.  Pursuant to the terms of the
Guaranty, Lopez absolutely and unconditionally guaranteed prompt and full
payment of any and all indebtedness of ATC “which now and/or hereafter exists”,
including payment of attorneys’ fees and court costs incurred by Plaintiff to
enforce payment under the Guaranty. 
Williams Decl., ¶14; Williams Decl., Ex. 2.  
            MBFS
received by assignment and perfected its lienholder interest in the Trailer by
obtaining a lienholder interest from the DMV reflecting MBFS as the lienholder
and ATC as the registered owner. 
Williams Decl., ¶15.  
            On
November 30, 2021, MBFS and DTFS entered into the Transaction whereby MBFS sold
to DTFS all of its rights and obligations with respect to all litigation or
claims exclusively related to or arising in connection with MBFS’s financial
services business in the United States related to the wholesale and retail
financing of trucks and buses.  Williams
Decl., ¶16; Williams Decl., Ex. 4.  As a
result of the Transaction, DTFS is now the proper party in interest in this and
other assigned contracts.  Williams Decl.,
¶16; Williams Decl., Ex. 4.  
 
            3.
Default 
            On or about May 5, 2023,
ATC and Lopez defaulted under the terms and conditions of the Agreement and the
Guaranty by failing to make the payment then due and owing.  Williams Decl., ¶17.  Plaintiff
has performed all of the conditions, covenants and promises required under the
terms of the Agreement.  Williams
Decl., ¶18.  
            Due to ATC and Lopez’s
payment default, Plaintiff elected to declare all unpaid sums immediately due
and payable.  Williams Decl.,
¶19.  Plaintiff’s account records reflect that there is currently due and owing
from ATC and Lopez the sum of $28,931.60, plus late charges and default
interest of 18.0% per annum from and after February 20, 2024, plus all
Plaintiff’s expenses for enforcing the Agreement, including expenses for
repossession, transportation, storage, preparing for sale and/or sale of the Trailer.  Williams Decl., ¶19, Ex. 5.  
            The Agreement states
that at no time is the Trailer allowed to be transferred without the knowledge
or consent of Plaintiff.  Williams
Decl., ¶20.  The Agreements further states at that: 
 
Should I default under this Agreement . . . I agree to turn over and
deliver the Collateral to Seller at my expense, at the time and at the location
Seller may demand of me. Alternatively, to the extent permitted by law, Seller
may enter any premises or other place where the Collateral may be located, and
take possession of the Collateral . . .  Williams
Decl., ¶21.  
 
Before commencement
of this action or by service of the complaint, Plaintiff demanded that
Defendants return the Trailer.  Defendants
refused.  Williams Decl.,
¶22.  Plaintiff is entitled to immediate possession of the Trailer.  Williams Decl., ¶22.  
            Upon full review of
Plaintiff’s records, credit file and computer screen account notes, Williams is
informed and believes and thereon alleges that the Trailer is presently located
at the address listed for ATC on the Agreement, and for Lopez on the Guaranty,
of 458 ½ S. Eastern Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90022.  Williams Decl., ¶24.  
 
            4. Valuation 
            As of January 24, 2024,
the approximate value of the Trailer is $30,325.00 according to the J.D. Power
Commercial Trucks Guide.  Williams
Decl., ¶25, Ex. 6.  
            Since the balance owed
is less than the value of Trailer, Defendants have equity in the Trailer.  Williams Decl., ¶27.  Therefore,
Plaintiff will post a bond in the sum of twice the value of Defendants’
interest in the Trailer, a total bond amount of $3,000.00 ($30,325.00
-$28,931.60 $1,393.40 x 2 = $2,786.80).  Williams
Decl., ¶27.  
 
D. Analysis
Plaintiff DTFS seeks
a writ of possession against Defendants for the Trailer.  No opposition is on file.
 
1. Probable Validity
Seller financed the purchase of the Trailer pursuant to the
Agreement.  On or about June 21, 2021,
ATC, by its president, Lopez, and Seller entered into the Agreement, in the
principal amount of $37,161.88, to borrow funds to purchase the Trailer.  Williams Decl., ¶12; Williams Decl., Ex.
1.   Pursuant to the Agreement, ATC
agreed to pay 60 consecutive monthly payments of $862.65 each commencing August
5, 2021, and monthly thereafter on the 5th day of each successive month until
all unpaid principal and interest were paid in full. Default Interest was
payable at the rate of 18.0% per annum pursuant to the Agreement.  Williams Decl., ¶13.  
            To
induce MBFS to extend credit to ATC, Defendant Lopez, for valuable
consideration, on June 21, 2021, executed and delivered a Guaranty.  Williams Decl., ¶14, Ex. 2.  Pursuant to the terms of the Guaranty, Lopez absolutely
and unconditionally guaranteed prompt and full payment of any and all
indebtedness of ATC “which now and/or hereafter exists”, including payment of
attorneys’ fees and court costs incurred by Plaintiff to enforce payment under
the Guaranty.  Williams Decl., ¶14, Ex.
2.  
On or about May 5,
2023, ATC and Lopez defaulted under the terms and conditions of the Agreement
and the Guaranty by failing to make the payment then due and owing.  Williams Decl., ¶17.  Due
to ATC and Lopez’s payment default, Plaintiff elected to declare all unpaid
sums immediately due and payable.  Williams
Decl., ¶19.  There is currently due and owing from ATC and Lopez the sum of $28,931.60.  Williams Decl., ¶19, Ex. 5.  
Plaintiff DTFS’ application suffers from two defects.  First, Plaintiff shows that MBFS sold to DTFS
its rights to a claim against Defendants but Plaintiff fails to show that
Seller assigned its rights to BMFS.  This
is an issue of standing.  As there is no
opposition and as the Certificate of Title for the Trailer lists MBFS as a
lienholder, the issue is waived.
Second, DTFS fails to support its calculation of damages by a
ledger or other calculation.  It provides
only a “Payoff Quotation” to suppoor the $28,931.60 owed.  The declaration supporting an application for
a writ of possession must be set forth with particularity.  CCP §516.030. 
This means that the plaintiff must show evidentiary facts rather than
the ultimate facts commonly found in pleadings. 
A recitation of conclusions without a foundation of evidentiary facts is
insufficient.  See Rodes v.
Shannon, (1961) 194 Cal.App.2d 743, 749 (declaration containing conclusions
inadequate for summary judgment); Schessler v. Keck, (1956) 138
Cal.App.2d 663, 669 (same).  The lack of
opposition is a waiver of this issue.
DTFS has established the probable validity of its claim to
possession of the Trailer.  CCP §§
511.090, 512.060(a).  
 
2. Undertaking
            The
undertaking required by CCP section 515.010(a) is an amount not less than twice
the value of the defendant's interest in the property or in a greater
amount.  Id.  The value of the defendant's interest in the
property is determined by the market value of the property less the amount due
and owing on any conditional sales contract or security agreement and all liens
and encumbrances on the property.  Id.  
As of January 24,
2024, the approximate value of the Trailer is $30,325.00 according to the J.D. Power
Commercial Trucks Guide.  Williams
Decl., ¶25, Ex. 6.  Since the balance owed is less than the value
of Trailer, Defendants have equity in the Trailer.  Williams Decl., ¶27.  DTFS agrees to post a bond that is twice the value of Defendants’ interest in the
Trailer, a total amount of $3,000.00 ($30,325.00 -$28,931.60 $1,393.40 x 2 =
$2,786.80).  Williams Decl.,
¶27.  
DTFS’ undertaking shall be $3000.  The re-delivery bond also shall be $3000.  CCP §515.020(a).
 
3. Location of the Vehicle
Based on the address
listed in the Agreement and the Guaranty, the Trailer is currently located at 458
½ S. Eastern Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90022. 
Williams Decl., ¶24.  The
levying officer may enter this location to recover the Trailer.  CCP §512.060(b).  
 
E. Conclusion
The applications for order for a writ of possession and
turnover order against Defendants ATC
and Lopez are granted.  DTFS’ undertaking
shall be $3000.  The re-delivery bond
also shall be $3000.
