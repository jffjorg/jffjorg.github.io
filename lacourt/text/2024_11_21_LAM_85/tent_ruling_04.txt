[1] On
November 7, 2024, Petitioners Rinsch and
Home VFX filed an opposition contending that service of the applications were
untimely because the time for substituted service had not passed.   The court continued the hearing to cure this
potential defect.  Th opposition also contended
that the proofs of service show substituted service on a person named Jivanni
without proof that Jivanni was authorized to receive service.  The court ruled at the November 8, 2024
hearing that Debtors have the burden of showing that Jivanni was not a proper
person for substituted service and they failed to do so.
