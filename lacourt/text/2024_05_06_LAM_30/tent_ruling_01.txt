v. US GC Investment, et. al., Case No. 21AHCV00134 (Consolidated with 21AHCV00164 and related to
20STCV09036 and 22STCP03994)
Tentative Ruling re: 
Defendant’s Motion to Set Aside Defaults and to Set Aside Order Deeming
requests for admission admitted.
Defendant Fu
moves to set aside the clerk’s Entry of Default on September 20, 2023
(21AHCV00134) and September 12, 2023 (21AHCV00164).  He requests that the Court allow him to file an
answer and cross complaint. Additionally, Defendant Fu moves to set aside an
order for admission to be deemed admitted. 
The motion is denied.
Under Code of
Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b): “the court may, upon any terms as
may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a
judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her
through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall be
accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall be made
within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment,
dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.”
To obtain discretionary relief under
section 473, subdivision (b), the party moving for relief on the basis of
“mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect” must show specific
facts demonstrating that one of these conditions was met. (Hopkins &
Carley v. Gens (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1410.)
Section
473 also provides, “[n]otwithstanding any other requirements of this section,
the court shall, whenever an application for relief is made no more than six
months after entry of judgment, is in proper form, and is accompanied by an
attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or neglect, vacate any (1) resulting default entered by the clerk
against his or her client, and which will result in entry of a default
judgment, or (2) resulting default judgment or dismissal entered against his or
her client, unless the court finds that the default or dismissal was not in
fact caused by the attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 473, subd. (b).)
“Section 473 is often
applied liberally where the party in default moves promptly to seek relief, and
the party opposing the motion will not suffer prejudice if relief is granted.
[Citations.] In such situations ‘very slight evidence will be required to justify
a court in setting aside the default.’ [Citations.] [¶] Moreover, because the
law strongly favors trial and disposition on the merits, any doubts in applying
section 473 must be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief from
default.” (Fasuyi v. Permatex, Inc. (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 681, 695.)
            The Complaint in
21AHCV00134 was filed on December 3, 2021. 
Defendant Fu was sub-served on December 13, 2021 and his default was
entered on September 20, 2023.
            The
Complaint in 21AHCV00164 was filed on December 30, 2021.  Defendant Fu was personally served on March
28, 2022 and his default was entered on September 12, 2023.
            The
instant motion seeking relief was filed on March 20, 2024, 182 days, and 190
days respectively from the entries of default. 
Although the motion was brought exactly six months after entry of
default in the earlier filed case, the Court finds the motion untimely.  The statute requires the motion to be brought
within a “reasonable time,” in no case exceeding six months.  Here, Defendant Fu does not deny he was
served with the complaints in both cases but did nothing.  He offers no testimony regarding when he
learned of the defaults and why he waited so long to seek relief.
            Even
if the motion was timely brought, the motion would be denied.  Defendant Fu vaguely declares that he was
told by counsel for Defendant GC Investment that settlement talks were ongoing,
“until sometime in 2023,” and so he thought settlement was inevitable and that his
interests would be protected by his co-defendants.  Defendant Fu also asserts that he was
confused because of the multiple cases to which he was a party.  Defendant Fu’s bare bones declaration simply
does not establish excusable neglect.
            Defendant
Fu also moves to Set Aside an Order Deeming Request for Admissions Admitted. On
September 28, 2023, the Court vacated the hearing on Plaintiff’s Motion to Deem
as Admitted Plaintiff’s Request for Admission (21AHCV00134). The Motion to Deem
Request for Admissions was never granted and thus there is no court order
deeming the request for admissions admitted. Additionally, a request to Set
Aside an Order Deeming Request for Admissions Admitted must be brought as a
separate motion.
