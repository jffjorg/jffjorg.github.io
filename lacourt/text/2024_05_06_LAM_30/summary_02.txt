And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint is sustained without leave to amend. The plaintiff's claims against the defendant are compulsory cross-claims and should have been brought as a cross-complaint in the earlier-filed action. The claims arise from the same transaction or occurrence as the earlier-filed action and are therefore related. The court has also denied the defendant's motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages as moot. The judge has concluded that the plaintiff's claims are barred by the compulsory cross-claim statute and that the plaintiff should have brought the claims as a cross-complaint in the earlier-filed action.
