Here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies Defendant Fu's motion to set aside defaults in two separate cases. Defendant Fu filed the motion 182 and 190 days after the entry of default, which exceeds the statute's requirement for a "reasonable time" of six months. The court finds that Defendant Fu's failure to respond to the Complaints is not excusable neglect, as he offers no testimony regarding when he learned of the defaults and why he waited so long to seek relief. Additionally, the court rules that Defendant Fu's motion to set aside an order deeming requests for admission admitted must be brought as a separate motion.
