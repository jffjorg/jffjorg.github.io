And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the demurrer filed by Ori Blumenfeld to the cross-complaint of 732 N. Vista Street, LLC. The cross-complaint arises from disputes related to the parties' co-ownership of real property located at 732 N. Vista Street in Los Angeles. The Court has determined that the first cause of action, which is for intentional tort, is insufficiently pled and has sustained Blumenfeld's demurrer with leave to amend. However, the Court has found that the second and third causes of action, which are for conversion and accounting, respectively, are sufficient to state claims and has overruled Blumenfeld's demurrer to those causes of action. Additionally, the Court has appointed John Rachlin as the partition referee in this case to resolve the partition of the property, which is necessary due to Blumenfeld's complaint.
