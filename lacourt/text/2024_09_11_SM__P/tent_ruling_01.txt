American Express
National Bank v. Alexander Afari Case No. 23SMCV01534
Hearing Date:
September 11, 2024
Defendant Afari’s Motion for Summary
Judgment or in the Alternative Summary Adjudication   
American Express brings a claim for common counts and
accounts stated against defendant Afari for failure to pay an outstanding
balance. Afari moves for summary judgment and, in the alternative summary
adjudication, arguing there exists no triable issue of fact. 
Afari argues the account-stated claim fails because the
claim is not brought under a contractual basis, contravening the recently-enacted
CCP §425.30 prohibiting such practices by debt buyers. This argument fails for
two reasons. First, Code of Civil Procedure section 425.30 provides an individual
cannot bring a claim for account stated in an action to collect consumer debt. Code
Civ. Proc. §425.30, becoming effective January 1, 2024. 
The statue does not apply to the claim here because
the debt was incurred no later than June 2022, before the statute went into
effect. Code Civ. Proc. § 425.30(b). By the terms of the statute, this debt
does not fall within the time frame covered. 
Second, the transactions are not “consumer debt”
because Afari applied for a business credit card and characterized the debt as
a business debt. Afari Decl. pp. 7:10,12-13 -9:4-7. Thus, the claim would not
be barred under CCP § 425.30. 
Finally, Afari alleges American Express is a debt
buyer, as required under Civil Code Sections 1788.52 and 1788.58. In
opposition, American Express states it is the original and current creditor of
the debt, not a purchaser of the debt. 
For the foregoing reasons, there is a question of
material fact, and issues as to the applicability of the statute. Summary
judgment and adjudication is DENIED.
