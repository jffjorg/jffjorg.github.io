And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication in the case brought by American Express National Bank against Alexander Afari. The defendant had argued that the claim for common counts and accounts stated fails because it is not brought under a contractual basis, contravening the recently-enacted CCP §425.30. However, the judge found that this argument fails for two reasons. First, the statute only applies to consumer debt, and the debt in this case was incurred before January 1, 2024, when the statute went into effect. Second, the debt was characterized as a business debt by the defendant, and therefore does not fall under the statute. The judge also found that American Express is the original and current creditor of the debt, and not a debt buyer, which further supports the claim. As a result, there are questions of material fact and issues as to the applicability of the statute, and the motion for summary judgment and adjudication is denied.
