And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories. The defendant sought further responses on four specific interrogatories. The Court finds that plaintiff's answers were unreasonably evasive and that the defendant has fulfilled the meet and confer requirement. The Court grants the motion to compel further responses on all four interrogatories.

The Court also awards sanctions in the amount of $1,069.95 to the defendant due to plaintiff's unsuccessful opposition to the motion. The plaintiff had previously claimed that the parties would meet and confer prior to the hearing date, but this did not occur.
