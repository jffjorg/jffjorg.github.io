And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendant, Christian Patron, and granted his motion to vacate and set aside the renewal of judgment. The renewed judgment, which was entered on July 12, 2023, is vacated, and any writs of execution issued under the renewed judgment are recalled and quashed. The plaintiff, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, is ordered to return to the defendant any property levied upon under the renewed judgment.

The judge found that the defendant was never served with the summons and complaint, and that the plaintiff had actual knowledge of the defendant's location and the means to serve him. The judge also found that the plaintiff's attempts to serve the defendant were unreasonable and that the defendant was incarcerated at the time the plaintiff sought to effectuate service.

The judge's ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and the California Evidence Code, and is consistent with previous court decisions, including Fidelity Creditor Service, Inc. v. Browne (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 195 and AO Alfa-Bank v. Yakovlev (2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 189.
