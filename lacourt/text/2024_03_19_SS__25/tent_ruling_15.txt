BACKGROUND
 
On
April 06, 2023, IFE Group dba Southern California Restaurant Design Group (“Plaintiff”),
filed two causes of action for breach of contract and common counts against
Defendants Victoria Allen (“Victoria”)[1],
and Jeff Allen (“Jeff”) (collectively “Defendants”).
 
Defendants,
in propria persona, each separately filed an Answer to the Complaint on May 17,
2023. 
 
On
November 09, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Deem Request for Admissions as
to both Defendants as Admitted. The Court granted Plaintiff’s motion on January
12, 2024. 
 
On
December 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Compel Responses to Plaintiff’s
Request for Production from both Defendants. 
 
On
January 19, 2024, the Court determined that the matter was not a “collection
hub case as defined by California Rules of Court, rule 3.740(a)” and ordered
the matter transferred to Department 1 at the Stanley Mosk Courthouse for
reassignment. 
 
On
January 24, 2024, the Court reassigned the matter to Limited Civil Non-Collections
Hub to Commissioner Latrice A.G. Byrdsong in Department 25 at the Spring Street
Courthouse. 
 
No
opposition has been filed. 
  
MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
            Plaintiff prays
for an order from the Court compelling both Defendants to respond, without
objection, to Plaintiff’s Request for Production, Set One (“RFPs”) which was served
on both Defendants on September 22, 2023. Plaintiff makes this motion on the
grounds that Defendants have failed to serve timely responses to the
above-described production of documents. Plaintiff additionally prays for $1,832.70
($1,118.00 if unopposed) in monetary sanctions to be issued against Defendants,
jointly and severally. 
 
OPPOSITION
 
             No opposition has been filed. 
 
REPLY
 
             No reply has been filed.
 
ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal Standard  
A party must respond to requests for
production of documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc. §
2031.260(a).)  If a party to whom requests for production of documents is
directed does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for
an order compelling response to the discovery.  (Code Civ. Proc. §
2031.300(c).)  The party also waives the right to make any objections,
including ones based on privilege or work-product protection.  (Code Civ.
Proc. §¿2031.300(a).)  There is no time limit for a motion to compel
responses to production of documents other than the cut-off on hearing
discovery motions 15 days before trial.  (Code Civ. Proc. §§¿2024.020(a),
2031.300.)  No meet and confer efforts are required before filing a motion
to compel responses to the discovery.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) 
II.        Discussion
As
a preliminary matter the Court notes that Plaintiff files two motions seeking
to compel responses to its RFPs from Defendants Victoria and Jeff Allen individually.
Since Plaintiff has paid the filing fees for both motions, argues the same
facts, and has provided Defendants with proper notice, the Court’s order will address
the merits of both motions below. 
 
Plaintiff
states in its moving papers that it served written discovery on the Defendants on
September 22, 2023, (See Mot. p. 4:4-5; See also Michael K. Hagemann Decl. ¶ 3;
Exh. 3.) Plaintiff additionally
provides the declaration of its counsel who swears that he has not received any
responses to either RFPs. (Hagemann Decl. ¶ 4.)
            
Here,
the Court finds that more than 30 days have lapsed since Plaintiff served its RFPs
on the Defendants. Plaintiff has
provided evidence showing that Defendants have not provided responses to both
of Plaintiff’s discovery requests. Thus, since more than thirty (30)
days has lapsed since Plaintiff served its RFPs, Plaintiff is therefore
entitled to pursue the instant motion.  
 
Accordingly, the
Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Discovery Responses to
Plaintiff’s Demand for Request for Productions (Set One) as to both Defendants
Victoria and Jeff Allen. 
 
 
D.
Sanctions
 
Code of Civil Procedure § 2023.030(a)
provides, in pertinent part, that the court may impose a monetary sanction on a
party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process to pay the reasonable
expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone because of that
conduct.  Misuse of discovery includes “failing to respond or submit to an
authorized method of discovery.”  (Code Civ. Proc. §¿2023.010(d)). 
 
The Court finds Defendants’ failure
to respond to Plaintiff’s discovery request, a misuse of the discovery process.
Plaintiff has successfully argued the motion and without evidence to the
contrary, the Court cannot find that Defendants acted with substantial
justification in failing to respond to Plaintiff’s discovery request. Thus, the
Court must impose monetary sanctions on the Defendants for their failure to
respond to the discovery request that necessitated the instant motion. 
 
Here,
since the motion is unopposed, Plaintiff seeks $1,118.00 in monetary sanctions
to be issued against the Defendants, jointly and severally for the sum of $138.00
in court cost, 1.8 hours in time spent drafting the motion at a rate of $350.00
per hour, plus one (1) hour in appearance fees. (Mot. P.1; Hagemann Decl. ¶¶
5-9.) The Court does not
find the amount reasonable given the simplicity of this Motion.  Accordingly, the Court grants sanctions in the
amount $838.00 for the sum of: two (2) hours combined for time spent drafting
the motion and for the appearance at a rate of $350.00 per hour, plus $138.00
in court fees.
