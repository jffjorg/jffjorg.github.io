And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

"This tentative ruling addresses the plaintiff's amended motion to compel responses from defendants Victoria Allen and Jeff Allen to their requests for production, as well as a request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,832.70. The plaintiff has alleged that the defendants have failed to respond to their requests and seeks to compel their responses without objection. The court finds that the plaintiff's claims are supported by the facts and that the defendants' failure to respond is a clear violation of California Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300(c). Therefore, the court grants the plaintiff's motion to compel responses and requests for monetary sanctions. The matter will be heard on March 19, 2024, in Department 25."
