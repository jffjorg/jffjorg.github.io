Plaintiff Juliana Viveros was appointed Claimant Roberto Rivas’s guardian  ad litem on September 21, 2022.    Defendant filed her Answer to the  Complaint on November 18, 2022.    On January 23, 2024, Petitioner  filed notice that the parties had reached an unconditional settlement agreement  on November 22, 2023.    On January 23, 2024, Petitioner the  instant Petition to Approve Compromise of Disputed Claim as to Minor Claimant:  Roberto Rivas (Age 16) (“Petition”).    No opposition has been filed.   MOVING PARTY  POSITION   Claimant, who is 16 years old, has  agreed to settle his claim against the Defendant for $7,500.00. As a result of a  car accident that happened on October 14, 2021, Claimant suffered sprains to his neck and lower back. Claimant received physio-chiropractic treatment and now  asserts he has fully recovered from his injuries. Out of the settlement  proceeds of $7,500.00, medical expenses of $2,500.00, and attorney’s fees of $2,500.00  will be deducted, leaving Claimant with $2,500.00. The $2,500.00 will be delivered  to Juliana Viveros, the parent of the minor,  without bond, on the terms and under the conditions specified in Probate Code  sections 3401-3402.   OPPOSITION               No  opposition has been filed.    REPLY               No reply  has been filed.    ANALYSIS   I.          Legal  Standard  Court approval is required for  all settlements of a minor’s claim. (Prob. Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.;  CCP § 372.) “‘[W]ithout trial court approval of the proposed compromise of the  ward’s claim, the settlement cannot be valid.  [Citation.] [¶] Nor is the  settlement binding [on the minor] until it is endorsed by the trial court.’” (Pearson  v. Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338.)  A minor, like  Claimant, “shall appear either by a guardian or conservator of the estate or by  a guardian ad litem appointed by the court in which the action or proceeding is  pending, or by a judge thereof, in each case.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 372(a)(1).)  Alternatively, the petitioner may file a declaration demonstrating that he or  she has a right to compromise the minor’s claim under Cal. Probate Code §  3500.     Regarding the substance of the  Petition, to obtain court approval of the settlement of a minor’s claims, the  petitioner must file a complete and “verified petition for approval of  the settlement and must disclose ‘all information that has any bearing upon the  reasonableness of the compromise.’ [Citations.]” (Barnes v. Western Heritage  Ins. Co. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 249, 256; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)  (Italics added.)    Under Probate Code § 3505, if a petition is unopposed, the  Court must issue a decision on the petition at the conclusion of the hearing.      II.        Discussion    Minor – Roberto  Rivas, 16 years old  Guardian Ad Litem – Juliana  Viveros  Defendant – Jennifer  Stephanie Huezo Quintanilla    Settlement:                                          $7,500.00  Attorney’s Fees:                                  $2,500.00  Litigation and Other  Costs:                $0.00  Medical Bills:                                      $2,500.00  TOTAL TO BE PAID TO MINOR:  $2,500.00    General Requirements  ·          Petition on Form  MC-350?                             YES  ·          Proposed Order on Form  MC-351?                YES  ·          Proof of service on  other parties?                       NO    Type of injury, medical expenses    Claimant Roberto Rivas suffered  sprains to his neck and lower back. (Pet. p. 2, ¶¿6.) Claimant received physio-chiropractic  treatment. (Id. at ¶ 7; Attach. 8.) The Complaint asserts that Claimant  has recovered completely and does not have any permanent injuries. (Id.  at ¶ 8.)    ·          Medical records  documenting injuries and treatment?  Yes. (Pet., Attach. 8.)  ·          Negotiated reduction  in medical liens?  Yes. (Pet. p. 4, ¶ 12(a)(3).)  ·          Injuries completely  healed?  Yes, Claimant has completely recovered and there are no  permanent injuries.  (Pet. p. 2, ¶ 8.)    Handling of Funds    How are settlement funds to be disposed of?  “$2,500.00  to be paid or delivered to a parent of the minor, without bond, on the terms  and under the conditions specified in Probate Code sections 3401-3402. The name  and address of the parent and the money or other property to be delivered are  specified in Attachment 18b(5).” (Pet. p. 8, 18(b)(5).)   Petitioner submits Attachment 18(b)(5), which identifies that the funds should  be deposited to Juliana Viveros, who’s address is 13032 Kamloops St., Pacomia,  CA 91331. (Attach.  18(b)(5).)   Attorneys’ Fees and Litigation Costs    ·          Attorneys’ fees  requested?  Yes, 33% of total settlement.  (Attach. 17(a) p. 23.)  ·          If yes, attorney  declaration including factors under CRC Rule 7.955(b)?  Declaration does discuss  the factors under CRC Rule 7.955(b). (Petition, Daniel F. Jimenez Decl.)  ·          Copy of retainer agreement?  Yes. (Attach. 17(a).)  ·          Litigation costs  requested?  No. ·          Itemized?   N/A     Here, the Court notes the following  deficiencies with the Petition:    (1)   Petitioner does not provide  the Court with proof of service, indicating that service was rendered on  Respondent by mail and by substituted service;   (2)   The Petition does not  provide a medical statement, such as a doctor’s note indicating that Claimant  has completely healed from his injury as required;   (3)   The Petitioner appears to  erroneously mark box 11(a) instead of 11(b) indicating that Defendant has  offered to pay money a person other than the claimant. Here, the Petitioner  completes line 11(b)(3) indicating that Petitioner is a plaintiff in the same  action and includes Attachment 11(b)(3) detailing the settlement payment to  others. Thus, Petitioner should check line 11b and additionally complete line  11b(5) with Petitioner’s name and the amount of her settlement.  Petitioner should also include Attachment  11b(6) detailing the reasons for apportionment of the settlement payments between  the minor claimant and petitioner per the instructions on that line; and   (4)   The Court notes a  discrepancy with the stated amount for Attorney’s fees. Here, the Fee Agreement  stipulates that Petitioner’s attorney will receive 33% of the settlement amount  in attorney’s fees. The stated amount of $2,500.00 does not equate to 33% of  the $7,500 settlement.    Therefore, for those reasons the Court CONTINUES the  Petition for Minor’s Compromise submitted on behalf of Minor Claimant Roberto  Rivas.     II.        Conclusion                           Petitioner/ Guardian ad  Litem, Juliana Viveros’s Petition to Approve Minor's Compromise of Disputed Claim on  behalf of Minor Roberto Rivas is  CONTINUED  TO APRIL 23, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. in Department 25 of the SPRING STREET  COURTHOUSE.    At least 16 court days before the  next scheduled hearing, Petitioner must file and serve supplemental papers  addressing the deficiencies noted above. Failure to do so will result in the  Motion being placed off calendar or denied.  On the Court's own motion, the Order to Show Cause Re:  Dismissal pursuant to Settlement currently scheduled for 04/22/2024 is CONTINUED to 06/12/2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Department 25 of the Spring Street Courthouse. Moving party is ordered to give notice.
