BACKGROUND
On November 18, 2022, Hillcrest Homes (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant
action challenging a citation issued by State of California Department of Public
Health (“Defendant”) for Plaintiff’s violation of the Long-Term Care, Health
and Safety and Security Act of 1973, requesting an order dismissing citation #
95-41511-0018009-S and associated civil penalty. 
Defendant filed its General Denial on February 28, 2023. 
On May 31, 2023, Defendant filed a Notice of Related Case, Hillcrest
Homes, et al. v. California Department of Public Health, et al., 23STCP00251.
On June 2, 2023, The Court found that the following cases,
22STCP04147 and 23STCP00251, are related within the meaning of California Rules
of Court, rule 3.300(a) and identified 22STCP04147 as the lead case. 
On October 5, 2023, the Court noted that related Case No. 23STCP00251
(HILLCREST HOMES vs STATE OF CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH) had not
yet been scheduled for hearing.  The
Court scheduled hearings for both Petitions for October 12, 2023, and vacated
the July 1, 2024, trial date.  
On October 12, 2023, the Court took the Petitions off calendar and
set a non-jury trial date for September 10, 2024, as the case was incorrectly
designated “Other Civil Petition.”
On January 17, 2024, Defendant filed the instant Motion to
Consolidate Actions for the Purposes of Trial. The Court on its own motion
continued the hearing on the motion after noting deficiencies in the moving
papers and ordered Defendant to file supplemental papers correcting the
deficiencies.
On February 23, 2024, Defendant filed supplemental papers in support
of the instant motion. 
No opposition has been filed.
MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
            Defendant prays
for the Court to issue an order consolidating case numbers 22STCP04147 and
23STCP00251 for the purposes of trial under CCP § 1048(a) because the actions
involve similar claims and are pending in the Los Angeles County Superior
Court. Defendant argues that consolidating the two actions would avoid unnecessary
cost and delay in matters involving the same parties and attorneys. Moreover,
the two actions will require the testimony of overlapping percipient and expert
witnesses. Defendant finally argues that Plaintiff will not be prejudiced by
the consolidation as it would not unduly confuse the Court and the Court would
be able to draw only appropriate inferences from both cases when it adjudicates
on the merits. 
 
OPPOSITION

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard
California Rules of Court, rule
3.350(a) states in relevant part: 
 
(1)  
A notice of motion to consolidate must: 
 
(A) List all named parties in each
case, the names of those who have appeared, and the names of their respective
attorneys of record; 
 
(B)  Contain the captions of all the
cases sought to be consolidated, with the lowest-numbered case shown first; and 
 
(C)  Be filed in each case sought to
be consolidated. 
 
(2)  
The motion to consolidate: 
 
(A) Is deemed a single motion for the
purpose of determining the appropriate filing fee, but memorandums,
declarations, and other supporting papers must be filed only in the
lowest-numbered case; 
 
(B)  Must be served on all attorneys
of record and all non-represented parties in all of the cases sought to be
consolidated; and 
 
(C)  Must have a proof of service
filed as part of the motion. 
 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.350(a)). 
 
Also, the consolidation statute,
Code of Civil Procedure § 1048, states in relevant part: 
 
(a)  When actions involving a common question of law
or fact are pending before the court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of
any or all the matters in issue in the actions; it may order all the actions
consolidated and it may make such orders concerning proceedings therein as may
tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay. 
 
(b)  The court, in furtherance of convenience or to
avoid prejudice, or when separate trials will be conducive to expedition and
economy, may order a separate trial of any cause of action, including a cause
of action asserted in a cross-complaint, or of any separate issue or of any
number of causes of action or issues, preserving the right of trial by jury
required by the Constitution or a statute of this state or of the United
States. 
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1048(a).) 
 
The granting or denial of the
motion to consolidate rests in the sound discretion of the trial court and will
not be reversed except upon a clear showing of abuse of discretion.  (See Fellner
v. Steinbaum (1955) 132 Cal.App.2d 509, 511.)  
 
II.        Discussion 
 
Defendant moves to consolidate
the following cases: 
 
1.     
Hillcrest Homes dba Woods Health Services v. State of
California Department of Public Health, 22STCP04147
2.     
Hillcrest Homes dba Woods Health Services v. State of
California Department of Public Health, 23STCP00251 
 
(Mot. p. 3.)  Defendant
argues that Case No. 22STCP04147 and
Case No. 23STCP00251 involve common questions of law and fact because,
 
…they are
brought under the Long-Term Care Act for the violation of state patient care
requirements. These various violations
occurred at the same facility, within a six-month period... Due to the
prevalence of common issues of fact, the trials in these cases will involve
multiple common percipient and expert witnesses.”  
 
(Gregory A. Schnitzer Decl. ¶ 5.) 
 
On June 02, 2023, the Court found
that cases “22STCP04147 and 23STCP00251, are related within the meaning of
California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a)” and “22STCP04147 is the lead
case.”  (06-02-23 Minute Order.)  Both cases were assigned to Judge
Katherine Chilton in Department 25 of the Spring Street Courthouse. (Id.) 
Therefore, the Court finds that the consolidation of these two cases is proper
and would be in the interest of judicial economy. 
 
In its prior order, the Court noted
that the Notice of Motion did not list the names of the attorneys of record for
each party. (02/15/24 Minute Order.) Further the Court found that the Notice of
Motion and Motion to Consolidate was not filed in Case No. 23STCP00251 as
required under CRC rule 3.350(a)(1)(C). (Id.) The Court notes that since issuing its
order, Defendant has since filed a supplemental notice correcting the
deficiencies noted in the Court’s February 15th order. (See Suppl. Notice of
Motion.) 
 
Having reviewed
the instant Motion, filed on February 23, 2024, The Court finds that it now complies
with California Rules of Court, rule 3.350(a). 
The Supplemental Notice of Motion  lists the names of the attorneys of record for
each party and has been filed in all cases listed for consolidation.  Defendant has also filed Proof of Electronic
Service of the moving papers. (Suppl. Mot. p. 26.) 
 
Accordingly, the Court finds that all requirements for
consolidation have been satisfied.  Defendant’s Motion is GRANTED.
 
III.       Conclusion 
            
Defendant
California Department of Public Health’s Motion to Consolidate Actions for the
Purpose of Trial, is GRANTED and the following actions are
HEREBY CONSOLIDATED FOR ALL PURPOSES. 
 
1.     
Hillcrest Homes dba Woods Health Services v. State of
California Department of Public Health, 22STCP04147
2.      Hillcrest Homes dba Woods
Health Services v. State of California Department of Public Health, 23STCP00251 
 
ALL FUTURE DOCUMENTS MUST BE FILED UNDER THE
CASE NUMBER AND CAPTION OF THE LEAD CASE. 
Case numbers on all subsequent filings should be reflected as follows:
Lead case number C/W other case number(s). Any future hearing dates in the
non-lead case(s) are advanced and taken off calendar.
 
As
to both Cases Non-Jury Trial currently set for 09/10/2024 at 8:30 a.m. in
Department 25 of the Spring Street Courthouse, remains on calendar as currently
scheduled.
 
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
