And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a petition to approve a settlement of a minor's claims (Roberto Rivas) against a defendant (Jennifer Stephanie Huezo Quintanilla). The settlement amount is $7,500.00, which will be paid to the minor's guardian ad litem (Juliana Viveros) without bond. The judge notes several deficiencies with the petition, including the lack of proof of service, a medical statement, and a discrepancy in attorney's fees. As a result, the judge continues the petition to April 23, 2024, and orders the petitioner to file and serve supplemental papers addressing the deficiencies before the next hearing.
