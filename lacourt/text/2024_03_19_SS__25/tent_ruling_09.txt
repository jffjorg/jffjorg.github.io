BACKGROUND
 
On August 2, 2022, Plaintiff Georgy
Ekpenisi (“Petitioner”) and minor Plaintiff Chimchetaram Macauley-Ekpenisi (“Minor
Claimant” or “Claimant”) filed an action against Defendant Emmanuel Tyrone Bull
(“Defendant”) relating to a motor vehicle accident that occured on November 5,
2021. Petitioner was appointed Claimant’s guardian ad litem on August 3, 2022. 
 
On August 5, 2022, Petitioner filed
an Expedited Petition to Approve Compromise of Disputed Claim. The Court denied
the Expedited Petition on August 15, 2022. The Court additionally denied
Petitioner’s Ex Parte Application for an Order Shortening Time for Hearing
Plaintiff’s Expedited Petition for Minor’s Compromise. 
 
On December 14, 2022, Petitioner
filed a Petition to Approve Minor’s Compromise of Disputed Claim. On January
18, 2023, the Court denied the Petition due to excessive deficiencies. 
 
On March 30, 2023, Petitioner filed
a second Petition to Approve Minor’s Compromise. On April 25, 2023, the Court
noted several deficiencies in the Petition and continued the hearing to allow
Petitioner an opportunity to correct these deficiencies.  
 
On May 30, 2023, after receiving no
supplemental papers correcting the deficiencies noted in the 4-25-23 minute
order, the Court denied the Petition for Approval of Minor’s Compromise. 
 
On August 1, 2023, Petitioner filed
a third Petition to Approve Minor’s Compromise (“Petition”). On October 23,
2023, the Court noted several deficiencies with the Petition and continued the
hearing on the Petition to January 17, 2024. 
 
On January 17, 2024, after
receiving no supplemental papers correcting the deficiencies noted in the 10-23-23
minute order, the Court denied the Petition for Approval of Minor’s Compromise.

 
On February 01, 2024, Petitioner
filed the instant Amended Petition for Approval of Compromise as to Minor Claimant
(“Amended Petition”). 
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
Claimant, who is 5 years old, has
agreed to settle his claim against the Defendant for $15,000.00. As a result of
a car accident that happened on November 05, 2021, Claimant suffered ankle pain
and bruises. Claimant was seen in an emergency room at Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center where he received several x-rays before being discharged. The Petition
asserts that Claimant has fully recovered from his injuries. Out of the
settlement proceeds of $15,000.00, medical expenses of $4,389.81, attorney’s
fees of $3,750.00, and Court fees and costs totaling $417.50 will be deducted,
leaving Claimant with $6,442.69. The $6,442.69 will be deposited in insured
accounts in one or more financial institutions in California, subject to
withdrawal only upon the authorization of the Court.

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard 
Court approval is required for
all settlements of a minor’s claim. (Prob. Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.;
CCP § 372.) “‘[W]ithout trial court approval of the proposed compromise of the
ward’s claim, the settlement cannot be valid.  [Citation.] [¶] Nor is the
settlement binding [on the minor] until it is endorsed by the trial court.’” (Pearson
v. Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338.)  A minor, like
Claimant, “shall appear either by a guardian or conservator of the estate or by
a guardian ad litem appointed by the court in which the action or proceeding is
pending, or by a judge thereof, in each case.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 372(a)(1).)
Alternatively, the petitioner may file a declaration demonstrating that he or
she has a right to compromise the minor’s claim under Cal. Probate Code §
3500.  
 
Regarding the substance of the
Petition, to obtain court approval of the settlement of a minor’s claims, the
petitioner must file a complete and “verified petition for approval of
the settlement and must disclose ‘all information that has any bearing upon the
reasonableness of the compromise.’ [Citations.]” (Barnes v. Western Heritage
Ins. Co. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 249, 256; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)
(Italics added.) 
 
Under Probate Code § 3505, if a petition is unopposed, the
Court must issue a decision on the petition at the conclusion of the hearing.

Type of injury, medical expenses 
 
Claimant Chimchetaram Macauley-Ekpenisi complained of ankle pain and bruises. (Amended Pet. p. 2,
¶¿7.)  Claimant received emergency care only and received several x-rays
before being discharged. (Id. at ¶ 8; Attach. 8.)  The Petition
further asserts that he has recovered completely and does not have any permanent
injuries.  (Id. at ¶ 9.) 
 
·        
Medical records
documenting injuries and treatment?  No.
·        
Negotiated reduction
in medical liens?  Yes.  (Pet. p. 4, ¶ 13(b)(2)(f)(ii)(B).) 
·        
Injuries completely
healed?  Yes, the Petition asserts that the Claimant has completely
recovered and there are no permanent injuries. (Pet. p. 2, ¶ 9.) However, the
Court notes the following deficiency below.  
 
Handling of Funds 
 
How are settlement funds to be disposed of?  “$6,442.69
be deposited in insured accounts in one or more financial institutions
in this state, subject to withdrawal only on authorization of the court. The
name, branch, and address of each depository are specified in Attachment 19b(2).” (Amended Pet. p. 8, 19(b)(2).)  Petitioner submits
Attachment 19(b)(2), which identifies that the funds should be deposited to
Bank of America, however the account cannot not open until the Court grants the
Minor’s compromise and Order to Deposit Money. (Attach. 19(b)(2).)  However,
the Court notes the following deficiency below.  
 
 
Attorneys’ Fees and Litigation Costs 
 
·        
Attorneys’ fees
requested?  Yes, 25% of total settlement. (Ekpenisi Decl. ¶ 8.) 
·        
If yes, attorney
declaration including factors under CRC 7.955(b)?  The Agreement provided
in Attachment 15(a) indicates that counsel is entitled to a 33.3% fee.
Counsel’s declaration states that Counsel’s office has further reduced the fee
to $3,750.00 or a 25% fee. (Petition, Ekpenisi Decl ¶ 8.) 
·        
Copy of retainer
agreement? Yes. (Attach. 15(a).) 
·        
Litigation costs
requested?  Yes. (Pet. p. 6 ¶ 14(b).) 
·        
Itemized? 
Yes. (Id.)  
 
Here, the Court notes that Petitioner
provides the Court with proof of service, indicating that service was rendered
on Respondent by mail and by substituted service. (02/06/24 Proof of Service
(not Summons and complaint).) 
 
However, the Court notes the following
deficiencies with the Petition: 
 
(1)   Based on the date of birth
and the filing of the instant Petition, Minor Claimant should be six (6) years
old and not five (5) years old as noted line 2(c) of the Petition.  The Petition and related submissions should
be updated accordingly;
 
(2)   The Petition appears to erroneously
mark box 12(b) instead of box 12(a) indicating that Defendant is only paying
Minor Claimant $15,000. If there are other persons besides the Minor Claimant
receiving money from the Defendant, they need to be listed in item 12(b)(5),
and an Attachment 12 should be included per item 12(b)(6). If not, then only box
12(a) needs to be marked; 
 
(3)   The Petitioner does not
provide any medical report that states that all the claimant’s injuries are resolved
per the requirements noted in line 9 of the petition. The Court notes that this
was previously noted in its 1-17-24 minute order regarding Petitioners 8-1-2023
Petition in which the Court found that, 
 
Petitioner claims Claimant’s injuries included ankle pain and bruises and
that the injuries are healed. However, the medical records submitted are not
sufficient to demonstrate the injuries claimed in the Petition. (Pet. ¶¶ 7-10;
pp. 11-18.) They only show an addendum to what Claimant’s mother wanted
corrected on the record and demonstrate Claimant received x-rays and was
discharged. Furthermore, there is no indication that minor Claimant has
completely recovered from the injuries. (Id.)
 
(See. 01/17/24 Minute Order.);
 
(4)   Attachment 19(b)(2) does
not include the branch and address of the specific Bank of America in which the
deposited funds will be held. Although Attachment 19(b)(2) notes that the
account cannot be established without a court order, this detail must still be
identified as it is required;
 
(5)   Attachment 15(a) should be
identified as Attachment 18(a); and
 
(6)   Lines 1, 4 and 5 of the
proposed Order to Deposit Money Into Blocked Account should be completed.
 
For these reasons, the Court CONTINUES the hearing on the Petition
for Minor’s Compromise submitted on behalf of Minor Claimant Chimchetaram
Macauley-Ekpenisi.
 
II.        Conclusion 
            
            Petitioner/ Guardian ad
Litem, Georgy Ekpenisi’s Petition to Approve Minor's Compromise Disputed Claim on
behalf of Minor Chimchetaram Macauley-Ekpenisi is CONTINUED TO APRIL 18, 2023
at 10:00 a.m. in Department 25 of the SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE. 
 
At least 16 court days before the
next scheduled hearing, Petitioner must file and serve supplemental papers
correcting the deficiencies noted above. Failure to do so will result in the
Motion being placed off calendar or denied.
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
