 Case Number:  22STCV26479    Hearing Date:   November 15, 2024    Dept:  28 Having  considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules as follows.  BACKGROUND  On  August 16, 2022, Plaintiff Oryyana Gordon  (“Plaintiff”), a minor, by and through her guardian ad litem Sylvia Smith,  filed this action against Defendants Vermont Place Development Co.  (“Defendant”) and Does 1-50 for general negligence and premises liability.  On August  18, 2022, the Court appointed Sylvia Smith to serve as Plaintiff’s guardian ad  litem.  On  July 10, 2023, Defendant filed an answer.  On January  12, 2024, Plaintiff filed a notice of settlement.  On  September 16, 2024, Petitioner Sylvia Smith (“Petitioner”) filed an amended  petition for expedited approval of the compromise of Plaintiff’s case.   PETITIONER’S REQUEST  Petitioner  Sylvia Smith asks the Court for expedited approval of the compromise of the  pending action of minor Plaintiff Oryyana Gordon.  DISCUSSION  The  petition contains the following information:  Gross  settlement amount:                    $2,500.00 Total  medical expenses:                       $2,013.56  Medical  expenses paid:                        $165.17   Reductions:                                          $92.61   To  be paid etc. from proceeds:             $72.56   Liens:                                                   (not  listed) Attorney’s  fees:                                   $885.17  or $625.00  Costs:                                                   $885.17  Net  balance:                                         $917.27 or $3,852.41  The  petition does not include Petitioner’s name in Section 1 of the petition.  The petition does not include Plaintiff's name  in Section 2 of the petition.  The petition  should include this information.   Section  13a(1) of the petition states that total medical expenses are $2,013.56.  Section 13a(3) of the petition states that  the total medical expenses were reduced by $92.61.  This should mean that the remaining amount  ($1,920.95) will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.  However, Section 13a(4) of the petition  states that only $72.56 of the medical expenses will be paid or reimbursed from  the settlement proceeds.  As a result,  $1,848.39 of the medical expenses remain unaccounted for.  Section  13a(5) does not list any liens.  The lien  amount should be the same as the amount to be paid or reimbursed from the  settlement proceeds.  Here, the  Department of Healthcare Services has agreed to accept $72.56 to satisfy its  Medi-Cal lien.  It is unclear if additional  liens exist in light of the medical expenses that remain unaccounted for.  Section  14a of the petition states that attorney’s fees are $885.17.  However, Section 17c of the petition states  that attorney’s fees are $625.00.  The figures  should be consistent.  Section  14b of the petition states that “Attorney Costs” are $885.17.  Petitioner should explain how she calculated  these costs.  Section  17f of the petition lists the net balance as $917.27.  Section 19b(2) of the petition states that  $3,852.41 is to be deposited in an insured account.  The figures should be consistent.  The  Court denies the petition.  CONCLUSION  The  Court DENIES the petition for expedited approval of the compromise of minor  Plaintiff Oryyana Gordon’s action filed by Petitioner Sylvia Smith on September 16, 2024.  Petitioner  is ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Petitioner  is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within  five days.
