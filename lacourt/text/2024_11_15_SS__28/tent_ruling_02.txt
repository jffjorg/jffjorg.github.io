 Case Number:  21STCV23922    Hearing Date:   November 15, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the documents submitted in support of the request for default
judgment, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On June
28, 2021, Plaintiff Manuel De Avila (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
Defendants Elizabeth Sandajan (“Defendant”) and Does 1-50 for motor vehicle
tort and general negligence. 
On
September 6, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s request for an order directing
service of the summons on Defendant by publication in the Los Angeles Times.  On December 5, 2023, Plaintiff filed a proof
of service by publication of the summons in the Los Angeles Times. 
On
March 15, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s ex parte request to authorize
Plaintiff to serve proof of the statement of damages in the Los Angeles Daily
Journal.  On June 20, 2024, Plaintiff
filed a proof of publication of the statement of damages in the Los Angeles
Daily Journal.  The statement of damages
listed property damage of $50,000.00 and diminished value of $50,000.00. 
On
August 12, 2024, the clerk entered Defendant’s default. 
On
September 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed an application for entry of Court judgment.  On September 5, 2024, the Court dismissed the
Doe defendants without prejudice at Plaintiff’s request. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to enter a default judgment against Defendant and award
Plaintiff $16,783.10, consisting of $10,500.00 in special damages, $3,786.84 in
prejudgment interest, and $2,496.26 in costs. 

LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
          California Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a), provides: 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not
sought or an application for separate judgment against specified parties under
Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each
judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
 The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry
of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or,
for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a
default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken
against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is
taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a
right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A
trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the
amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p.
494.) 
DISCUSSION 
          Plaintiff has submitted a complete default judgment
application with all required information. 
The Court grants the application and awards Plaintiff $16,783.10. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff Manuel De Avila’s application for default judgment against
Defendant Elizabeth Sandajan filed on September 3, 2024.  The Court awards Plaintiff Manuel De Avila $16,783.10. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
