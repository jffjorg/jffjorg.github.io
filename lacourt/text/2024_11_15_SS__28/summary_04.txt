And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a petition for expedited approval of a compromise of a minor's (Oryyana Gordon) case against Vermont Place Development Co. The petition was filed by Sylvia Smith, the guardian ad litem for the minor. The judge notes several discrepancies in the petition, including inconsistencies in the figures for medical expenses, attorney's fees, and the net balance. The judge also points out that the petition does not include the names of the Petitioner and Plaintiff in the relevant sections. Due to these inconsistencies, the judge denies the petition and orders the Petitioner to give notice of this ruling and to file proof of service of this ruling with the Court within five days.
