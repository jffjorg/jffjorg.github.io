And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding motions filed by defendant Lyft Inc. on September 18, 2024. Lyft had sought to dismiss plaintiff Haran Jackson's second cause of action for products liability and to strike plaintiff's punitive damages claim. However, on November 4, 2024, the court dismissed plaintiff's products liability claim with prejudice and struck plaintiff's punitive damages claim with prejudice, based on a stipulation between the plaintiff and Lyft. As a result, the judge has taken Lyft's motions off the calendar, as they are now deemed moot.
