As for the summary text, here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply papers in this action. Defendant Michelle Gonzalez has moved for summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication. The Court has found that Defendant has not carried her initial burden on summary judgment or summary adjudication. The Court has also found that Plaintiff has raised triable issues of fact concerning several matters, including whether Defendant checked her mirrors before turning into a diagonal parking space, whether Defendant activated her turn signal before turning into the parking space, whether Defendant failed to look over her right shoulder before turning right into the parking space, and whether Defendant "darted" in front of Plaintiff, giving him insufficient time to brake. Therefore, the Court denies the motion.
