And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the plaintiff's request for a default judgment against the defendant, Shanna Nikole, is denied. The plaintiff, Velocity Investments, LLC, purchased a delinquent account from the original creditor and filed a complaint against the defendant seeking $33,521.29 in damages. The defendant failed to respond to the complaint and the plaintiff successfully requested the entry of default. However, the plaintiff failed to comply with the requirements for a default judgment, including providing a declaration of diligence showing prior attempts to personally serve the defendant. As a result, the judge is denying the plaintiff's request for a default judgment.
