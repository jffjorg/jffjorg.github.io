And here is the English text summary:

The tentative ruling is a summary of the judge's thoughts on the case before the hearing. The case is about whether Waterlee Productions, Inc. (Respondent) should have its motion to vacate the arbitration award granted. The award was given in favor of Aimprosoft (Petitioner) for $44,235.00 plus 10% interest starting on December 16, 2022. The Respondent argues that the motion to vacate is timely, but the Court concludes that it is untimely and declines to extend the time to file the motion. The Court also discusses the doctrine of equitable tolling, which allows for the extension of time limits in certain circumstances, but finds that the Respondent does not meet the requirements for equitable tolling. As a result, the Court grants the petition to confirm the arbitration award and denies the motion to vacate.
