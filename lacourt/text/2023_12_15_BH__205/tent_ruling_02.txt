CASE NAME: Velocity Investments, LLC v. Shanna Nikole
CASE NUMBER: 23SMCV01692
COMP. FILED: April 20, 2023
PROCEEDINGS: REQUEST FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT
MOVING PARTY: Velocity Investments, LLC
RESPONDING PARTY: Shanna Nikole
BACKGROUND
This is a collections case. Defendant Shanna Nikole is the account holder. Defendant
failed to make payments on her account. Plaintiff Velocity Investments Inc. purchases portfolios
of delinquent accounts either from the original creditor or a subsequent purchaser of the account.
Plaintiff bought Defendant’s debt.
On April 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against Defendant. The Complaint alleges
common counts for account stated and open book account. The Complaint seeks $33,521.29, in
damages.
Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing Defendant was served by substitute service on
August 15, 2023. Defendant was obligated to respond within 30 days. Defendant did not do so.
Plaintiff successfully requested the entry of Defendant’s default, which was entered by the
Clerk’s Office on October 25, 2023. Plaintiff requested a default judgment on the same date.
Plaintiff served Defendant by mail with both the Request for Entry of Default and Request for
Default Judgment. Defendant has not appeared.
RELIEF REQUESTED
Default judgment against Defendant for a total of $34,063.46, which is comprised of: (1)
$33,521.29, for damages, and (2) $542.17, for costs.
ANALYSIS
Code of Civil Procedure section 585 sets forth the two options for obtaining a
default judgment. First, where the plaintiff’s complaint seeks compensatory damages
only, in a sum certain which is readily ascertainable from the allegations of the complaint
or statement of damages, the clerk may enter the default judgment for that amount.
However, if the relief requested in the complaint is more complicated, consisting of either
nonmonetary relief, or monetary relief in amounts which require either an accounting,
additional evidence, or the exercise of judgment to ascertain, the plaintiff must request
entry of judgment by the court. In such cases, the plaintiff must affirmatively establish his
entitlement to the specific judgment requested. (Kim v. Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011)
201 Cal.App.4th 267, 287.) Section 585 also allows for interest, costs and attorney fees,
where otherwise allowed by law. (Code of Civ. Proc. 585(a).)
Multiple specific documents are required, such as: (1) form CIV 105, (2) a brief summary of
the case; (3) declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (4) interest
computations as necessary; (5) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (6) a proposed form of
judgment; (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate
judgment under Code Civ. Proc. § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (8)
exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the
parties. (CRC Rule 3.1800.)
Here, Plaintiff has not complied with the requirements for a default judgment. While
Plaintiff claims to have served Defendant by substituted service, the proof of service does not
contain a declaration of diligence showing prior attempts to personally serve Defendant. In order
to avail oneself of substituted service under § 415.20, Plaintiff must make two or three attempts
to personally serve a defendant. (Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior University v. Ham
(2013) 216 Cal. App. 4th 330, 337.)
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff Velocity Investments, LLC’s Request for Default
Judgment is DENIED as to Defendant Shanna Nikole.
