And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to discovery requests. The motion was filed by defendant James S. Davidson, who is seeking to compel plaintiff Kent Moyer to provide further responses to requests for production and for sanctions. The court found that the motion was untimely, as it was filed after the 45-day deadline had passed. The court also denied each side's request for sanctions. The judge concludes that there is no misuse of the discovery process by either side, and that the 45-day deadline is mandatory and jurisdictional.
