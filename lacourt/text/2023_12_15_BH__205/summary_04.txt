And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling is in response to Defendant Shelon Douglas' demurrer to the complaint in an unlawful detainer action brought by Plaintiff Jason Waggoner, trustee of the Waggoner Family Trust. The action concerns a rental property located at 236 Waterview St. in Playa Del Rey, California, where the Tenant has failed to pay rent. The Tenant argues that the Landlord cannot bring an unlawful detainer action because the property has been declared "substandard" by the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety. The Court has denied the Tenant's request for judicial notice of certain documents and has overruled the demurrer, finding that the Tenant's arguments go beyond the face of the complaint and rely on facts that are not judicially noticeable. The Court has also denied the Tenant's request for leave to amend the complaint, finding that the Tenant's arguments are better raised and addressed in a motion for summary judgment.
