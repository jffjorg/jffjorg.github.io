Significant Statements:
  - "Trial courts generally have the inherent power to stay proceedings in the interests of justice and to promote judicial efficiency." (Freiberg v. City of Mission Viejo (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1484, 1489)
  - "The rule which forbids a later action in the same state between the same parties involving the same subject matter rests upon principles of wisdom and justice, to prevent vexation, oppression and harassment, to prevent unnecessary litigation, to prevent a multiplicity of suits,â€”in short, to prevent two actions between the same parties involving the same subject matter from proceeding independently of each other." (Simmons v. Superior Court (1950) 96 Cal.App.2d 119, 124-125)
  - "The Court does not view the ABC Action as a prior action that precludes the efficient litigation of the claims here, nor is a stay warranted in favor of the Delaware Action."
