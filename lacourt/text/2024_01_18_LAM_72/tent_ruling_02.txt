Plaintiffs Cem Ismet Guvendiren (“Cem”) and Ali Taylan
Guvendiren (“Ali”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) move for the appointment of a
receiver to take possession of Ismos Investment Corp. (“Ismos”) and the
issuance of a preliminary injunction prohibiting Defendants Melih Uskan, Mark
Buckley, and Ismos Investment Corp. (collectively, “Defendants”) from
committing waste of Ismos’s assets and ordering Defendants to turn over
possession of Ismos to the receiver.
 
The Court DENIES Plaintiffs’ motion without prejudice.  Under Los Angeles County Superior Court Local
Rule 2.8, pre-judgment motions for appointment of a receiver must be filed in a
writs and receiver department.  The Court
considers Plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction to be intertwined
with the request for a receiver.
 
Plaintiffs may file their request for a receiver in the
correct department.  Plaintiffs may also
renew their request for preliminary injunction in connection with the request
for a receiver in the correct department.
