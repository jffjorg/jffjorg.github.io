Plaintiff Stewart Goldman (“Plaintiff”) requests attorney’s
fees in the amount of $20,754.24 payable by Defendant General Motors LLC (“Defendant”).
 
Plaintiff’s motion for attorney’s fees is GRANTED in the
amount a total of $14,330.24, comprised of:
 
(1) $12,900 in attorney’s
fees; and
(2) $1,430.24 in
costs.
 
          The
Court ORDERS Defendant to pay this amount to Plaintiff’s counsel within 30 days
of this order.
 
Background
 
Plaintiff purchased a vehicle from Defendant that he alleges
was defective in violation of the Song-Beverly act. On December 19, 2022,
Plaintiff filed the Complaint against Defendant, alleging violations of the
Song-Beverly Act.
 
On February 3, 2023, Defendant offered to repurchase
Plaintiff’s vehicle, but did not receive a response. Defendant followed up on
the offer several times over the next few months.
 
On June 19, 2023, Defendant served on Plaintiff an offer to
compromise pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, section 998. Defendant offered
a settlement of $44,250.00 and $8,500.00 in attorney’s fees. Plaintiff declined
this offer.
 
The parties ultimately settled for $46,500.00 but could not
reach an agreement on the amount of attorney’s fees.
 
Plaintiff now requests attorney’s fees in this action.
Plaintiff requests a total of $20,754.24, comprised of:
 
(1) $19,324.00 in
attorney’s fees; and
(2) $1,430.24 in
costs.
 
Defendant filed an opposition and Plaintiff filed a reply.
 
Evidentiary Objections
 
Having considered Defendant’s evidentiary objections, the
Court overrules the objections.
 
Legal Standard
 
In General
 
A buyer who prevails in an action under the Song-Beverly Act
may recover their reasonable costs and expenses, attorney’s fees based on
actual time expended. (Civ. Code, § 1794.)
 
The lodestar method for calculating attorney fees applies to
any statutory attorney fees award, unless the statute authorizing the award
provides for another method of calculation. (Glaviano v. Sacramento City
Unified School Dist. (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 744, 750-751.) “Under the
lodestar method, the trial court must first determine the lodestar figure—the
reasonable hours spent multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate—based on a
careful compilation of the time spent and reasonable hourly compensation of
each attorney involved in the presentation of the case.” (Id. at p.
751.) 
 
The trial court has broad authority to determine the amount
of a reasonable fee. (PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th
1084, 1095.)  
 
The moving party bears the burden of proof as to
“reasonableness” of any fee claim. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(5).)
The party seeking fees has the burden of documenting the appropriate hours
expended and hourly rates. (City of Colton v. Singletary (2012) 206
Cal.App.4th 751, 784.) This burden requires competent evidence as to the nature
and value of the services rendered. (Martino v. Denevi (1986) 182
Cal.App.3d 553, 559.) A plaintiff’s verified billing invoices are prima
facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and services listed were necessarily
incurred. (Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682.) 
 
“In challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many
hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point
to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to
the evidence. General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative,
or unrelated do not suffice.” (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230
Cal.App.4th 459, 488, quoting Premier Med. Mgmt. Sys., Inc. v. California
Ins. Guarantee Ass’n (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.) When items are
properly objected to, the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as
costs. (Melnyk v. Robledo (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618, 623-624.)
 
Courts’ approach to determining fees under the Song-Beverly
act ordinarily begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably
expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate. (Warren v. Kia Motors
America, Inc. (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 24, 36; see also PLCM Group, Inc. v.
Drexler, supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 1095.) The lodestar figure may then
be adjusted based on factors specific to the case, which may include, without
limitation, “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill
displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the
litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent
nature of the fee award.” (Warren, supra, at p. 36 [internal
quotations and citations omitted].)
 
Ascertaining the fee amount is left to the trial court’s
sound discretion. (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.) 
 
998 Offers
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 998 establishes a procedure
to shift costs if a party fails to accept a reasonable settlement offer before
trial. The purpose of the statute is to encourage pretrial settlements. Section
998 provides that if a plaintiff fails to accept a written offer to compromise
by a defendant and fails to obtain a more favorable judgment, the plaintiff
cannot recover its postoffer costs and must pay the defendant's costs incurred
after the offer. (Code Civ. Proc. § 998 subd. (c)(1).)
 
In reviewing a section 998 offer, courts interpret any
ambiguity in the offer against its proponent. (Prince v. Invensure Ins.
Brokers, Inc. (2018) 23 Cal.App.5th 614, 622.) “An offer to compromise
under section 998 must be sufficiently specific to allow the recipient to
evaluate the worth of the offer and make a reasoned decision whether to accept
the offer.” (Fassberg Construction Co. v. Housing Authority of City of Los
Angeles (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 720, 764, 60 Cal.Rptr.3d 375.) Where a
defendant's settlement offer contains terms that make it “exceedingly difficult
or impossible to determine the value of the offer to the plaintiff[. . . . a
court should not undertake extraordinary efforts to attempt to determine
whether the judgment is more favorable to the plaintiff. Instead, the court
should conclude that the offer is not sufficiently specific or certain to
determine its value and deny cost shifting under Code of Civil Procedure
section 998.” (Id. at 766.)
 
Discussion
 
Repurchase Offer
 
Defendant argues that Plaintiff should not recover
attorney’s fees past the date of Defendant’s repurchase offer, because the
continued litigation beyond that point solely served to drive up costs. However,
Defendant has not stated the amount of the original repurchase offer, which
Plaintiff asserts is less than the final settlement. Furthermore, offer does
not appear to have been a formal 998 offer. As such, the Court is not able to
conclude that the repurchase offer cut off subsequent attorney’s fees.
 
Hourly Rates
 
Plaintiff requests hourly rates of $695.00 for Michael
Saeedian, $525.00 for Christopher Urner, and $250.00 for Jorge Acosta. Saeedian
has practiced law since 2009. Urner has practiced law for five years. Acosta is
a law clerk who has worked in the legal industry for five years. The Court
finds these rates to be reasonable.
 
Hours
 
The Court finds the hours requested to be excessive. For
example, the requested hours include a large number of non-legal administrative
tasks, the majority of which are billed at 0.1 hours. The Court therefore
reduces the fees awarded to $12,900, approximately two thirds of the requested
fees.
 
Costs
 
Plaintiff provides a memorandum of costs averred to by
Saeedian. The Court finds these costs to be reasonable.
