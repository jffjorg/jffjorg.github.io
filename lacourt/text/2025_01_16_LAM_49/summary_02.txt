And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a supplemental complaint. The plaintiff is seeking to add claims for violation of Civil Code §1950.5, alleging that the defendant failed to return a security deposit. The defendant has not opposed the motion. The judge finds that the plaintiff has shown good cause for the supplemental complaint, as the new allegations are based on conduct occurring after the plaintiff moved out of the subject property and after the filing of the complaint. The judge notes that the court will still conduct a hearing on the matter, but may adopt the tentative ruling. The plaintiff is ordered to file and serve the supplemental complaint within 10 days, and to give notice to all current parties unless waived.
