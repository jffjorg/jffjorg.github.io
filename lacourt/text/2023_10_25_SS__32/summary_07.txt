And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling grants the motion to compel the deposition of defendant Weimin Chen, who has failed to appear for multiple deposition notices despite claims of unavailability. The court finds that defendant has not served objections on the noticed depositions and has failed to appear, justifying the grant of the motion. The court also declines to award monetary sanctions to the plaintiff, finding that sanctions would be unjust. The defendant is ordered to appear for deposition within 30 days of notice of this order.
