The Judge issues a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Defendant Cao Son Do to specially set the hearing date for his motion for summary judgment, or in the alternative, continue trial and all related dates. The motion is unopposed. The Judge notes that the motion was timely filed and that Defendant argues that the earliest date available for a summary judgment hearing was January 2, 2024, which is after the current trial date. The Judge grants the motion to continue trial, but denies the motion to advance the hearing date for the motion for summary judgment. The final status conference is continued to January 31, 2024, and trial is continued to February 14, 2024.
