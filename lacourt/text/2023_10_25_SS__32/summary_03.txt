And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to reset the case for jury trial. The plaintiffs, Bewaji Alabi and Paul Nwachukwu, filed a complaint against the defendants, Stan H. Soto and Susan Soto, on June 25, 2021, and demanded a jury trial. However, the plaintiffs failed to pay the required jury fee of $150 within 365 days, which resulted in their waiver of the right to a jury trial. The defendants opposed the motion, but did not provide any reason for prejudice if the waiver is granted. The judge notes that the public policy favors jury trials and that no prejudice has been identified by the parties, so the motion is granted.
