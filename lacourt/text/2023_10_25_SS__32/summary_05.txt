And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted a motion to continue the trial date in part. The current trial date of December 8, 2023, is continued to August 12, 2024. The Final Status Conference, currently set for November 21, 2023, is continued to July 29, 2024. The court has considered the factors for granting a continuance, including the proximity of the trial date, whether there was any previous continuance, and the length of the continuance requested. The court has also taken into account the parties' need for time to complete discovery and prepare for trial. The judge has granted a shorter continuance than requested, citing the need for the parties to complete discovery and prepare for trial, but has also expressed a willingness to reconsider a request to continue trial if motions for summary judgment are timely filed and earlier hearing dates do not become available.
