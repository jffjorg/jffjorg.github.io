And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Jamie Lynne Reyes, pending the filing and service of an updated proposed order. The motion was filed by Counsel Ronald I. Goldszer due to a breakdown of the attorney-client relationship. Although no opposition was filed, the Court finds a valid reason for withdrawal and that Counsel has made reasonable efforts to confirm Plaintiff's address. However, the proposed order contains errors and the Court orders Counsel to file an amended form MC-053 within 5 calendar days of the hearing. The amended order should include information about all future hearings and proceedings noticed by any party or ordered by the Court.
