The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the case is granted. The plaintiff's attorney's assistant failed to calendar the order to show cause hearing on December 21, 2023, resulting in the counsel not appearing at the hearing and the case being dismissed. The plaintiff has provided an attorney declaration attesting to the attorney's mistake, inadvertence, and excusable neglect. The judge grants the motion and sets an order to show cause (OSC) re: Dismissal for Failure to File Proof of Service on August 9, 2024, at 8:30 a.m., in Department 28 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
