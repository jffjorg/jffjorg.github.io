```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the petition and proposed order filed by Brittany Terry, the guardian ad litem for Rafael Gomez, a minor plaintiff. The petition seeks expedited approval of the compromise of Rafael Gomez's action. However, the court has identified several inconsistencies in the petition and proposed order, including the omission of $30.00 in medical expenses from the settlement proceeds and the incorrect calculation of attorney's fees. The court has ordered the petitioner to revise the petition and proposed order to correct these inconsistencies. The court has also denied the petition for expedited approval without prejudice, meaning that the petitioner can re-file the petition after the revisions have been made.
