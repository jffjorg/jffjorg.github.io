 Case Number:  21STCV37761    Hearing Date:   July 11, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On October
12, 2021, Plaintiffs Brittany Terry, Rosa Bautista, and Rafael Gomez, through
his guardian ad litem Brittany Terry, filed this action against Defendants Round
Trip Transportation, Inc., Antonio Rodriguez, and Does 1-25 for motor vehicle
tort. 
On
November 3, 2021, the Court appointed Brittany Terry
to serve as guardian ad litem for Plaintiff Rafael
Gomez. 
On November
23, 2022, Defendants Roundtrip Transportation, Inc. and Antonio Rodriguez filed
an answer. 
On January
24, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a notice of settlement. 
On
May 2, 2024, Petitioner Brittany Terry (“Petitioner”) filed a petition for
expedited approval of the compromise of Plaintiff Rafael
Gomez’s action. 
PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
asks the Court for expedited approval of the compromise of the action of minor
Plaintiff Rafael Gomez (“Plaintiff”). 
DISCUSSION 
A.   The petition 
Sections
8 and 13a(1) of the petition state that Plaintiff incurred $30.00 in medical expenses for a
well child check-up by pediatrician Nasir Tejani, M.D. on October 31, 2019.  Section 13a(4) of the petition states that this
amount will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.  However, Section 17 of the petition does not
include $30.00 in the amounts being deducted from the gross settlement amount to calculate the net amount available to Plaintiff.  Instead, Section 17b states that no medical
expenses will be paid from the settlement proceeds.  Petitioner should revise the petition to
correct these inconsistencies. 
Petitioner should also revise the net settlement figure if appropriate. 
Section
14a of the petition does not list the amount of attorney’s fees being requested.  Section 17c of the petition states that
attorney’s fees are $150.00, which is 30% of the $500.00 gross settlement
amount.  The attached attorney
declaration, however, states that counsel is requesting 25% of the gross
settlement amount. (Esfandi dec. pp. 1-2.) 
25% of $500.00 is $125.00.  Petitioner
should revise the petition to correct these inconsistencies. 
The
petition does not include an Attachment 19b(4) which provides the name and
address of the parent to whom the net settlement amount is to be paid or
delivered on the terms and under the conditions specified in Probate Code
sections 3401-3402, without bond.  (See
Petition, Section 19b(4).) 
B.   The proposed order 
Petitioner
should revise Section 8 of the proposed order to be consistent with the revisions
to the petition. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice the petition for expedited approval of the
compromise of minor Plaintiff Rafael Gomez’s action filed by Petitioner Brittany
Terry on May 2, 2024. 
Petitioner
is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within
five days.
