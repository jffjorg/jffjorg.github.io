MOTION
TO COMPEL FURTHER DISCOVERY RESPONSES



 
 
            This is a
quiet title action concerning the real property at 8940 Kramerwood Place, Los
Angeles, California 90034.  Before the
court are various discovery motions and a motion to continue trial filed by
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant U.S. Bank National Association (“U.S. Bank”), and motion
to compel further discovery responses filed by Defendant/Cross-Complainant
Sannette Gite (“Gite”).  On March 18, 2022, the court issued an order
deeming this case related to Case No. 22STCV01686.  The actions were consolidated on February 8,
2024.
 
On June 14, 2023, Gite served Cross-Defendant Velocity
Commercial Capital, LLC (“Velocity”), with Special Interrogatories, Set One.  On July 18, 2023, pursuant to an agreement
extending time to respond, Velocity served responses to the special
interrogatories.  Gite took issue with
Velocity’s responses.  Meet and confer
efforts did not resolve the discovery dispute.
 
On November 13, 2023, Gite filed this motion to compel
Velocity’s further responses to Special Interrogatory Nos. 8, 14-30, 34, and 35.  Gite seeks sanctions against Velocity and its
counsel of record.
 
The motion was heard on February 13, 2024.  Because the parties had not participated in
an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) prior to the hearing of the motion, the
court continued the hearing for Gite’s motion to March 28, 2024.
 
The parties have not participated in an informal discovery
conference nor informed the court of the status of the discovery dispute.  
 
            Accordingly,
the motion is DENIED without prejudice.
 
Clerk of the Court to give notice.
