MOTION
TO SET ASIDE DISMISSAL AND FOR ENTRY OF JUDGMENT



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
Ernest Packaging
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            This is a collections case. 
On October 3, 2022, Plaintiff, Ernest Packing, filed a complaint against
Defendant, Walnut LLC.
 
            On January
3, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Settlement.  
 
            On March 9,
2023, Plaintiff filed the parties’ Stipulation for Entry of Judgment.
 
            On April
18, 2023, pursuant to Plaintiff’s oral motion to dismiss under CCP section
664.6, the court dismissed the case without prejudiced and retained
jurisdiction to enforce any and all terms of settlement, including judgment. 
 
            On July 7,
2023, Plaintiff filed Response to the OSC re Dismissal, stating that the matter
should remain on calendar because no settlement was reached.  Plaintiff did not dismiss the case.
 
            On July 14,
2023, at the hearing for the OSC re Dismissal, the court stated that California
Rules of Court permitted the court to dismiss the action if the court
determined the settlement was enforceable. 
The parties were directed to brief the enforceability of the settlement
agreement. 
 
            On February
23, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion to set aside the dismissal and enter
judgment against Defendant hearing. 
 
            The motion
is unopposed.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
 
“If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court
or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court,
upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.¿ If
requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to
enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6.)¿¿¿ 
 
In hearing a section 664.6 motion,
the trial court may receive evidence, determine disputed facts, and enter terms
of a settlement agreement as a judgment.¿ (Bowers v. Raymond J. Lucia
Companies, Inc. (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 724, 732.)¿ The court may interpret
the terms and conditions to settlement (Fiore v. Alvord (1985) 182
Cal.App.3d 561, 566), but the court may not create material terms of a
settlement, as opposed to deciding what terms the parties themselves have
previously agreed upon (Weddington Productions, Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60
Cal.App.4th 793, 810).¿ The party seeking to enforce a settlement “must first
establish the agreement at issue was set forth ‘in a writing signed by the
parties’ (§ 664.6) or was made orally before the court.  [Citation.]”¿ (Harris
v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 299, 304 [holding that
a letter confirming the essential terms of a settlement agreement was not a
“writing signed by the parties” sufficient to satisfy the requirements of
Section 664.6].)¿ 
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
A. Retention of Jurisdiction 
 
“‘[V]oluntary dismissal of an action or special proceeding
terminates the court’s jurisdiction over the matter.’  (Conservatorship
of Martha P. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 857, 867) [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 142.) ‘If
requested by the parties,’ however, ‘the [trial] court may retain
jurisdiction over the parties to enforce [a] settlement until performance in
full of the terms of the settlement.’ (§ 664.6, italics added.)”  (Mesa
RHF Partners, L.P. v. City of Los Angeles (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 913,
917.)  “‘Because of its summary nature, strict compliance with the
requirements of section 664.6 is prerequisite to invoking the power of the
court to impose a settlement agreement.’”  (Ibid. (quoting Sully-Miller
Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103
Cal.App.4th 30, 37).) 
 
“A request for the trial court to retain jurisdiction under
section 664.6 ‘must conform to the same three requirements which the
Legislature and the courts have deemed necessary for section 664.6 enforcement
of the settlement itself: the request must be made (1) during the pendency of
the case, not after the case has been dismissed in its entirety, (2) by the
parties themselves, and (3) either in a writing signed by the parties or orally
before the court.’”  (Ibid. (quoting Wackeen v. Malis (2002)
97 Cal.App.4th 429, 440).)  “The ‘request must be express, not implied
from other language, and it must be clear and unambiguous.’” (Ibid. (quoting
Wackeen, supra, 97 Cal.App.4th at 440).) 
 
Here, the parties signed a Stipulation for Entry of Judgment
(“Stipulation”) containing the parties’ agreement for the court to retain
jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §664.6 to enforce the terms of
the stipulation and enter judgment in the event of default. (Stipulation ¶¶ 11,¿19.) 
Prior to the dismissal of this action, the Stipulation was signed by the
parties and submitted to the Court.  (Ibid.)  On April 18, 2023,
the Court dismissed the entire case pursuant to the Stipulation and expressly
stated that it “retains jurisdiction to make orders to enforce any and all
terms of settlement, including judgment, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
Section 664.6.”  (Minute Order, 4/18/23.) 
 
B. Entry of Judgment 
 
The Stipulation Agreement provides that Plaintiff and
Defendant agree to dismiss the action without prejudice on the premise that
Defendant will compensate Plaintiff for the settlement amount of $42,000,
consisting of a down payment of $5,000, monthly payments of $2,000 from January
1, 2023 to December 1, 2023, and thereafter, monthly payments of $3,000 until
the settlement amount is paid in full. (Stipulation, ¶ 2.)  Pursuant to
the Stipulation, Defendant will also pay $525 for the first appearance fee and related
filing fee.  (Id.)  Interest will not accrue so long as
Defendant makes timely payments.  (Id.)  All parties signed
the Stipulation. 
 
The Stipulation also provides that in the event Defendant
fails to make timely payments, Plaintiff will give Defendant five (5) day written
email notice to cure any missed payments. 
If the default is not cured within five (5) days of not receiving written
email notice, Plaintiff may without further notice[1]
to Defendant or Defendant’s counsel, “have the dismissal set aside and have
judgment entered against DEFENDANT for the JUDGMENT AMOUNT less credits for
payments made being first applied to interest at 10% per annum on the JUDGMENT
AMOUNT from November 8, 2022, and then against the principal of the JUDGMENT
AMOUNT, plus interest as provided hereinabove plus any and all other sums
provided for in this STIPULATION.”  (Ibid. at ¶ 4.)  The
Stipulation also provides for a late notice fee of $350 and attorneys’ fees of
$1,500.  (Ibid. at ¶¶ 4, 5.) 
 
Plaintiff now seeks an order to set aside dismissal and
enter judgment against Defendant in the sum of $31,181.45, consisting of the
balance of judgment of $25,831.45, attorney fees in the sum of $1,500 and late
notice fees of $3,850.  
 
Plaintiff substantiates the judgment sought.  Defendant incurred late notice fees in the
total sum of $3,850 for late payments made on 12/23/2022, 2/15/2023, 3/09/2023,
4/07/2023, 5/05/2023, 6/03/2023, 7/05/2023, 8/04/2023, 9/13/2023, 10/11/2023,
and 11/04/2023.  (Minassian Decl., Ex.
3.)  Defendant has not made any payments
since 11/04/2023 and is therefore in default.  
 
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s unopposed Motion for Order Setting
Aside Dismissal and for Entry of Judgment after Default Pursuant to Stipulation
is GRANTED.  Dismissal entered on April 18, 2023, is vacated.  Judgment is entered for Plaintiff and against
Defendant for $31,181.45, consisting of the balance of judgment of $25,831.45,
attorney fees in the sum of $1,500 and late notice fees of $3,850.  
 
Plaintiff is to submit the proposed judgment within ten days
of this Order.
