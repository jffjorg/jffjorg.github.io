Petitioner provides now that the attorney has neither received nor expects to receive attorney’s fees or other compensation in connection with the claim. However, the Court notes that the attorney is, in fact, claiming attorney’s fees on the petitions filed for the other minor claimants in this matter, thereby rendering this statement incorrect. Petitioner must accurately mark the correct box, and name each claimant/plaintiff who already paid or is expected to pay attorney’s fees in connection with this matter, and list the amount.   The Court is unable to locate the Order Approving Compromise of Claim (MC-351). Further, because the net balance will be deposited into a blocked account, Petitioner must also file an Order to Deposit Funds (MC-355) in connection with the petition.   James Thompson  The Court has reviewed the Petition to Approve Compromise of Pending Action of minor James Thompson, Age 13, submitted on September 19, 2023.   If the settlement is approved, $305.38 will be used for medical expenses, $8,750 for attorneys’ fees, and $450 will be used for costs. The net balance of $25,494.62 will deposited into a blocked account.  The Court denies the petition for the following reasons:  The Petition intended for James instead has the information for Iris on Item 2 of MC-350EX.   Item 18b is incorrect for different reasons in the new petition. Petitioner provides the attorney has neither received nor expects to receive attorney’s fees or other compensation in connection with the claim. However, the Court notes that the attorney is, in fact, claiming attorney’s fees on the petitions filed for the other minor claimants in this matter, thereby rendering this statement incorrect. Petitioner must accurately mark the correct box, and name each claimant/plaintiff who already paid or is expected to pay attorney’s fees in connection with this matter, and list the amount.   The Court is unable to locate the Order Approving Compromise of Claim (MC-351). Further, because the net balance will be deposited into a blocked account, Petitioner must also file an Order to Deposit Funds (MC-355) in connection with the petition.   Amanda Duarte  The Court has reviewed the Petition to Approve Compromise of Pending Action of minor Amanda Duarte, Age 17, submitted on September 19, 2023.   If the settlement is approved, $1,420.42 will be used for medical expenses, $8,750 for attorneys’ fees, and $450 will be used for costs. The net balance of $24,379.58 will deposited into a blocked account.  The Court denies the petition for the following reasons:  Item 18b is incorrect for different reasons in the new petition. Petitioner provides the attorney has neither received nor expects to receive attorney’s fees or other compensation in connection with the claim. However, the Court notes that the attorney is, in fact, claiming attorney’s fees on the petitions filed for the other minor claimants in this matter, thereby rendering this statement incorrect. Petitioner must accurately mark the correct box, and name each claimant/plaintiff who already paid or is expected to pay attorney’s fees in connection with this matter, and list the amount.   Additionally, page 7 of MC-350EX is again unsigned in its entirety.  Lastly, the Court is unable to locate the Order Approving Compromise of Claim (MC-351). Further, because the net balance will be deposited into a blocked account, Petitioner must also file an Order to Deposit Funds (MC-355) in connection with the petition.   Rodolfo Duarte Jr.   The Court has reviewed the Petition to Approve Compromise of Pending Action of minor Rodolfo Duarte Jr., Age 17, submitted on September 19, 2023.   If the settlement is approved, $1,000 will be used for medical expenses, $3,750 for attorneys’ fees, and $435 will be used for costs. The net balance of $9,815 will deposited into a blocked account.  The Court denies the petitions for the following reasons:  The expenses to be paid or reimbursed from Rodolfo’s portion of the settlement does not match between Item 14(b) and on Item 17(d). Item 14(b) provides costs in the amount of $435, whereas Item 17(d) seeks costs in the amount of $450. Petitioner must verify the amount sought and be consistent.   On Item 18b, Petitioner provides the attorney has neither received nor expects to receive attorney’s fees or other compensation in connection with the claim. However, the attorney is, in fact, claiming attorney’s fees on the petitions filed for the other minor claimants in this matter, thereby rendering this statement incorrect. Petitioner must accurately mark the correct box, and name each claimant/plaintiff who already paid or is expected to pay attorney’s fees in connection with this matter, and list the amount.   The Court is unable to locate the Order Approving Compromise of Claim (MC-351). Further, because the net balance will be deposited into a blocked account, Petitioner must also file an Order to Deposit Funds (MC-355) in connection with the petition.  In the amended petition, Petitioner must cure all the above noted defects at their earliest convenience.   Moving party is ordered to give notice.
