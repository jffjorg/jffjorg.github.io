And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the petitions to approve the compromise of pending actions of four minor claimants: Iris Thompson, James Thompson, Amanda Duarte, and Rodolfo Duarte Jr. The petitions aim to settle the claims against the defendants with a total amount of $35,000 per claimant, with the net balance to be deposited into a blocked account.

However, the Court denies the petitions due to several defects. Firstly, the petition for James Thompson has incorrect information on Item 2 of MC-350EX, which is intended for Iris Thompson. Secondly, the petition for Iris Thompson has an incorrect statement on Item 18b, which claims that the attorney has neither received nor expects to receive attorney's fees or other compensation in connection with the claim, despite the fact that the attorney is claiming attorney's fees on the petitions filed for the other minor claimants in this matter.

Additionally, the petition for Amanda Duarte is unsigned on page 7 of MC-350EX, and the petition for Rodolfo Duarte Jr. has inconsistent expenses to be paid or reimbursed from his portion of the settlement. The Court also notes that it is unable to locate the Order Approving Compromise of Claim (MC-351) and requires the petitioner to file an Order to Deposit Funds (MC-355) in connection with the petition.

The Court orders the petitioner to cure all the above-noted defects at their earliest convenience and to give notice to the moving party.
