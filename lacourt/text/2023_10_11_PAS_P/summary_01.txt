Summary:

The judge sustains the demurrer to the Fourth Amended Complaint without leave to amend. The claims are all barred by their applicable statutes of limitation. The court finds that the plaintiff, Intermedia Film Distribution, Ltd., has not alleged any new facts that would toll the statute of limitations. The court also finds that the plaintiff's delayed discovery allegations fail because they are focused on discovery of the source of distribution rather than the distribution itself. The court recognizes that this is an anomalous result because the arbitrator reached a contrary conclusion with respect to the statute of limitations in the arbitration award.
