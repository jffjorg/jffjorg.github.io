English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Margaret L. Oldendorf regarding a motion for determination of good faith settlement. The case involves the death of Kevin Powell, Sr. at the Vagabond Inn, which was managed by First to Serve, Inc. (FTS) and staffed by Lekendrick Richards and Olivia Cobain. The plaintiffs, who are the minor children of Kevin Powell, Sr. and the personal representative of his estate, sued FTS, Richards, Cobain, and others for wrongful death, negligence, survival action, and negligent hiring, training, and retention. The defendants filed a cross-complaint against Go RN LLC, which provided medical services to the homeless individuals. The defendants have settled with the plaintiffs for $500,000.00 and move for a determination of the good faith of the settlement. The judge grants the motion, finding that the settlement was made in good faith and that the evidence suggests that the defendants agreed to settle without collusion, fraud, or other improper conduct.
