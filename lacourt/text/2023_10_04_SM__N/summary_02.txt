And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has taken off calendar the defendants' motion to compel documents related to Fortis Developmental Services, Inc. The defendants argue that the plaintiffs agreed to comply with their requests for production of documents, but this is belied by the fact that the plaintiffs refused to produce the documents and only cited statements made in a meet-and-confer session, not their written responses to the requests. The judge finds that this is a motion to compel further responses and not a motion to compel compliance, and that the defendants must refile their motion as a motion to compel further responses and obtain a new hearing reservation date.
