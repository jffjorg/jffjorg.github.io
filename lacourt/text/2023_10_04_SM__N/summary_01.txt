And here is the summary in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling granting Plaintiff Eidan Gamaty's motion for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint. The Plaintiff seeks to add new allegations, a new defendant, JBEK Insurance Services, LLC, and new causes of action for unjust enrichment and conversion. The Court finds that the amendment is proper, as the Plaintiff presents credible statements that they were unaware of the underlying facts until July 2023, and the delay in seeking the amendment was not substantial. The Court trusts that the Plaintiff will swiftly engage in discovery given the necessity to bring this action to trial. The Plaintiff is ordered to file a clean copy of the Second Amended Complaint within ten days of the entry of this order.
