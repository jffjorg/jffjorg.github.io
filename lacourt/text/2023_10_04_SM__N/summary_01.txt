Summary:
The Judge grants Plaintiff Eidan Gamaty's Motion for Leave to File Second Amended Complaint. Plaintiff must file a clean copy of the Second Amended Complaint within ten days of entry of this order.

Although there is a possibility of trial date postponement, the Court trusts Plaintiff will swiftly engage in discovery.
