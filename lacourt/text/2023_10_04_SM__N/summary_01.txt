Summary:
The Judge grants Plaintiff Eidan Gamaty's Motion for Leave to File Second Amended Complaint. Plaintiff must file a clean copy of the Second Amended Complaint within ten days of entry of this order. The Judge finds that amendment is proper, as Plaintiff presents credible statements that he was unaware of the underlying facts until July 2023. Defendants' claim of Plaintiff's knowledge in March 2023 is not substantial enough to deny Plaintiff the chance to litigate a claim against JBEK Insurance Services, LLC. Although there is a possibility of trial date postponement, the Court trusts Plaintiff will swiftly engage in discovery.
