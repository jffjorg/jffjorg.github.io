And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike portions of the complaint filed by Plaintiff Augustine Rotibi against Defendant Starbucks Corporation. The Judge has sustained the demurrer, meaning that the complaint does not have sufficient legal grounds to support a claim, and has given the Plaintiff 30 days to amend the complaint. The Judge has also denied the motion to strike portions of the complaint as moot since the demurrer has been sustained. The Judge has ruled that the Plaintiff's claim for violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act is insufficient because it lacks sufficient facts to support the claim and does not allege intentional discrimination or liability against the Defendant. The Judge has ordered the Plaintiff to reformulate the complaint, but has not allowed the Plaintiff to add a new party or cause of action without permission.
