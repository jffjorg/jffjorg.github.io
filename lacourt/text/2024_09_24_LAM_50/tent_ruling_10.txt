[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:  
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 




            
Plaintiff Blue Hill Specialty Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) requests
entry of default judgment against Defendant Raymundo Loya. Plaintiff seeks
judgment in the total amount of $112,204.30, comprising $111,680.30 in damages
and $524.00 in costs. 
The Court notes two defects with the submitted default judgment
package. 
First, in the supporting
declaration of Kayleigh Tyson, Ms. Tyson states that a property damage claim
was settled between Plaintiff and its insured in the amount of $1,000.00.
(Tyson Decl., p. 3.) Ms. Tyson also states that “[t]he insured and plaintiff
agreed to settle the uninsured motorist claim” as to Arsen Sargsyan in the
amount of $105,000.00, and as to Adolfo Valladares in the amount of $1,400.00. (Ibid.)
Adding up the amounts of $1,000.00, $105,000.00, and $1,400.00 equals a total
of $107,400.00. However, Plaintiff seeks $111,860.30 in damages in connection
with the instant request. (Request for Court Judgment, Item 2(a).) Plaintiff
does not appear to substantiate all of the requested $111,860.30 damages.
Second, Plaintiff seeks
$524.00 in costs. However, the proposed judgment appears to list the amount of $524.00
under the category of “Other.” (See Proposed Judgment, Item
6(a)(5).)  
Based on the foregoing, the Court denies
Plaintiff’s request for default judgment without prejudice. The Clerk will
discuss with Plaintiff a schedule for resubmission of the default judgment
package.
