[1]Petitioner states
in the motion that “[p]ursuant to a settlement reached in connection with HHO’s
bankruptcy, HHO withdrew itself as a party to the Appeal on September 18,
2023,” and that “only Wolfe would ultimately be liable for the fees and costs
requested.” (Mot. at p. 1, fn. 1.) 
 


[2]On August 20,
2024, the Court issued a minute order continuing the hearing on the motion from
August 28, 2024 to September 24, 2024. 


[3]In his
supplemental declaration filed on July 25, 2024, Petitioner’s counsel states
that Brennan Mitch is a senior associate at BCLGI, and that Mr. Mitch’s hourly
rate in this matter is $385 per hour. (Suppl. Sandelmann Decl., ¶ 5.) The Court
also finds that this requested hourly billing rate is reasonable. 


[4]As discussed, the
Remittitur filed on November 22, 2023 in this action states, inter alia,
that “Respondent David Wehrly is awarded his costs on appeal.”
