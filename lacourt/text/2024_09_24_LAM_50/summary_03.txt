And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff, AZUSA GARVEY PROPERTIES, LLC, brought an action against the WEST COVINA AUTO PLAZA ASSOCIATION, INC. and others, alleging intentional interference with prospective economic advantage and declaratory relief. The defendants argue that the plaintiff's claims are without merit because the Association did not hold a meeting on July 6, 2021, as alleged by the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff has failed to provide evidence showing that the Association authorized the implementation of an overlay zone in the Auto Plaza.

The judge finds that the defendants have met their initial burden of demonstrating that the plaintiff's claims are without merit and that the plaintiff has not raised a triable issue of material fact. Therefore, the judge grants the defendants' motion for summary judgment and orders the defendants to file and serve a proposed judgment within 10 days.
