And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Blue Hill Specialty Insurance Company's request for default judgment against Raymundo Loya and others without prejudice. The company had sought judgment in the amount of $112,204.30, but the judge identified two defects in the company's supporting declaration. First, the declaration did not substantiate all of the requested damages, which totalled $111,680.30. Second, the proposed judgment listed the amount of $524.00 in costs under the category of "Other", rather than specifying the costs. The judge has given the company the opportunity to resubmit the default judgment package and has set a schedule for discussion with the company.
