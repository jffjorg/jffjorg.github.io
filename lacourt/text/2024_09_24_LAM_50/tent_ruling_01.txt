  ORDER RE:  
 
MOTION FOR AWARD
  OF ATTORNEY’S FEES AND COSTS ON POST-JUDGMENT PROCEEDINGS
 



 
            Background

On February 19, 2021, Petitioner David Wehrly (“Petitioner”) filed a
Petition to Confirm Contractual Arbitration Award in this action against
Respondents Hawthorne Hangar Operations, LP and Dan Wolfe as Trustee. 
On March 9, 2021, Petitioner filed a First Amended Petition to Confirm
Contractual Arbitration Award against Respondents Hawthorne Hangar Operations,
LP (“HHO”) and Dan Wolfe as Trustee of the Wolfe Family Trust of 1992 (“Wolfe”).

On May 13, 2022, the Court issued a Judgment in this action providing,
inter alia, that “The Petition to Confirm Contractual Arbitration Award
filed by David Wehrly (‘Petitioner’) under Los Angeles Superior Court case
number 21STCP00556 (‘Petition Action’) against Hawthorne Hangar Operations, LP,
Dan Wolfe as Trustee of the Wolfe Family Trust of 1992, and Does 1-10 is hereby
ORDERED CONFIRMED in favor of Petitioner and against the Respondents Hawthorne
Hangar Operations, LP and Dan Wolfe as Trustee of the Wolfe Family Trust of
1992 (‘Respondents’) as follows:…” The May 13, 2022 Judgment further provides, inter
alia, that “[i]n total, through May 13, 2022, the Judgment amount in favor
of Petitioner and against Respondents is $1,200,439.73…and the Judgment amount
in favor of Petitioner and against Messina & Hankin LLP is $3,663.93…”  
On September 20, 2023, the Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District,
Division One issued an Opinion in Case No. B321452 (Los Angeles County Super.
Ct. No. 21STCP00556)
providing,
inter alia, that “Dan Wolfe appeals from a judgment confirming an
arbitration award in favor of David Wehrly…We hold the arbitrator’s ruling was
based on his interpretation of the agreement, not a modification of it, and the
ruling did not conflict with the earlier declaratory judgment, which involved a
different agreement and different parties. Wolfe has forfeited his illegality
challenge for failing timely to raise it before the arbitrator. Accordingly, we
affirm.” 
On November 22, 2023, a Remittitur was filed in this action providing,
inter alia, that “the attached is a true and correct copy of the
original order, opinion or decision entered in the above-entitled cause on
September 20, 2023 and that this order, opinion or decision has now become
final. Respondent David Wehrly is awarded his costs on appeal.” 
Petitioner moves “for an award of attorney’s fees in the amount of
$517,662.40…on the grounds that the Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District
affirmed the trial court ruling favoring [Petitioner] against Dan Wolfe, as
Trustee of the Wolfe Family Trust of 1992 on September 20, 2023 – as well as
for fees incurred in connection with defending the Judgment before the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California.” Petitioner
also seeks costs.[1] Wolfe
opposes. 
On June 25, 2024, the Court issued an Order continuing the hearing on
the instant motion to August 28, 2024, as the Court required supplemental
briefing on certain issues.[2]
The Court’s June 25, 2024 Order provides, inter alia, that “Petitioner’s supplemental
declaration to be filed and served by July 25, 2024, with a courtesy copy
delivered to Dept. 50.¿¿Wolfe’s response, if any, to be filed and served by
August 21, 2024, with a courtesy copy delivered to Dept. 50.¿The argument and evidence
in the supplemental papers are limited to the requested additional information,
as discussed above, and the response thereto. The parties may not include any
argument or evidence on any other issue.” 
On July 25, 2024,
Petitioner filed a Supplemental Declaration of Frank Sandelmann in Support of
Motion for Award of Attorney’s Fees and Costs on Appeal. On August 14, 2024,
Wolfe filed a supplemental opposition. 
Discussion
A.    Entitlement to Attorney’s Fees
As discussed
in the Court’s June 25, 2024 Order on the instant motion, the Court found that “Petitioner
has demonstrated that he is entitled to attorney’s fees and costs against Wolfe
in connection with the appeal in Case No. B321452.” (June 25,
2024 Order at p. 7:10-12.) In addition, the June 25, 2024 Order provides that “the Court does not find that Petitioner has demonstrated that
he is entitled to attorney’s fees and costs against Wolfe in connection with
the subject bankruptcy proceedings.” (Id. at p.
15:15-17.) 
B.    Reasonableness of Fees
“[T]he fee
setting inquiry in California ordinarily begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the
number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate. …
The reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar
work. The lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration of
factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value
for the legal services provided.”
((PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095 [internal
citations omitted].)
“[T]he court’s
discretion in awarding attorney fees is…to be exercised so as to fully
compensate counsel for the prevailing party for services reasonably provided to
his or her client.” ((Horsford v. Board of Trustees of California State
University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th
359, 395.) “[T]he
verified time statements of the attorneys, as officers of the court, are
entitled to credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are
erroneous.” ((Id. at p. 396.) The
trial court may reduce the award where the fee request appears unreasonably
inflated, such as where the attorneys’ efforts are unorganized or duplicative. ((Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 635, fn. 21.)
As set forth above, Petitioner moves for an award of attorney’s fee in
the amount of $517,662.40. (Notice of Mot. at p. 2:2.) The Court’s June 25,
2024 Order on the instant motion provides, inter alia, as follows:
 
“As an initial
matter, Petitioner indicates that Craig G. Margulies, Samuel M. Boyamian, and
their firm Margulies Faith LLP represented Petitioner in the “Bankruptcy Case
of HHO.” (Margulies Decl., ¶¶ 1-2; Boyamian ¶¶ 1-2.) Mr. Margulies states that
he “spent 255.60 hours for this matter for a sum that equals to $164,470.50.”
(Margulies Decl., ¶ 8.) Mr. Boyamian states that he “spent 164.10 hours for
this matter for a sum that equals to $69,508.40.” (Boyamian Decl., ¶ 8.) As set
forth above, the Court does not find that Petitioner has
demonstrated that he is entitled to attorney’s fees and costs against Wolfe in
connection with the subject bankruptcy proceedings. Thus, the
Court deducts $233,978.90 ($164,470.50 + $69,508.40) from
the total amount of attorney’s fees requested.” (June 25, 2024 Order at p.
16:6-14.) 
The Court’s June 25, 2024 Order also noted that “Petitioner’s counsel
at Beach Cities Law Group, Inc. (‘BCLGI’) request the following hourly rates:
(1) Frank Sandelmann: $485/hour, (2) Joshua A. Valene: $385/hour, and (3)
Christine C. Fries: $315/hour. (Sandelmann Decl., ¶¶ 4-6.) Wolfe does not
appear to challenge Petitioner’s counsels’ requested hourly rates. The Court
finds Petitioner’s counsels’ hourly billing rates are reasonable.” (June 25,
2024 Order at p. 16:15-19.)[3] 
The June 25, 2024 Order provides that “the Court will require a
supplemental declaration from Petitioner’s counsel more clearly setting forth
the fees incurred by Petitioner solely in connection with the subject appeal in Case
No. B321452.” (June 25, 2024 Order at p. 18:24-26.) On July 25, 2024,
Petitioner filed a Supplemental Declaration of Frank Sandelmann in support of
the instant motion.  
In his supplemental declaration, Mr. Sandelmann states that “Defendants/Respondents
Appeal (B321452) is labeled ‘Appeal’.” (Suppl. Sandelmann Decl., ¶ 10(a).) Mr. Sandelmann
states that $43,435.50 in attorney’s fees were incurred in connection with the
“Appeal.” (Suppl. Sandelmann Decl., ¶¶ 11(a); 26.) 
In the supplemental opposition, Wolfe asserts that “[t]he amount of
fees should not exceed $43,435.50.” (Suppl. Opp’n at p. 4:15.) Thus, Wolfe first
does not appear to challenge the requested $43,435.50 in attorney’s fees
incurred in connection with the subject appeal. 
However, Wolfe’s counsel also identifies certain billing entries
appearing in the “Appeal” section of Mr. Sandelmann’s supplemental declaration that
are partially redacted. (Jamison Decl., ¶ 11.) Wolfe’s counsel asserts in the
declaration that “I am informed and believe that some, if not all of the
redactions are actually referring to bankruptcy-related pleadings. I am
informed and believed [sic] that the short redaction markings are redacting: ‘BK,’
which is generally understood in the legal industry to stand for ‘Bankruptcy.’”
(Jamison Decl., ¶ 11.) However, Wolfe’s counsel does not appear to specify the
basis for such beliefs or state that he reviewed an unredacted version of the
subject billing entries. 
            The Court finds that the requested $43,435.50
in attorney’s fees incurred in connection with the subject appeal (Case No. B321452)
is reasonable. 
Mr. Sandelmann also states in his supplemental declaration that $64,707.50
in attorney’s fees were incurred in connection with a “Mixed Matter.” (Suppl. Sandelmann
Decl., ¶ 11(f).) “Entries involving two or more matters are under the ‘Mixed
Matter’ heading.” (Suppl. Sandelmann Decl., ¶ 10(f).) Certain entries involving
a “Mixed Matter” concern the Appeal. (Suppl. Sandelmann Decl., ¶ 33.) Mr. Sandelmann
states that “[f]or Mixed Matter attorney fees, we have assigned the
corresponding percentage that the particular matter’s attorney fees bear to the
overall attorney fees incurred between December 2022 and December 2023.”
(Suppl. Sandelmann Decl., ¶ 34.) The percentage assigned to the “Appeal” is 18.2%,
and the corresponding amount assigned to the “Appeal” is $11,776.77. (Suppl. Sandelmann
Decl., ¶ 34.)
In the supplemental opposition, Wolfe asserts that “some of the ‘Mixed
Matter’ billing entries give zero indication of what Matter they refer to.
There is no suggestion of how much time was spent on any single task within a
string of unrelated tasks. Thus, the percentages assigned to the ‘Mixed Matter’
categories of attorney fees are arbitrary and unreliable.” (Suppl. Opp’n at p.
13:9-13.) However, the time entries for the “Mixed Matter[s]” are preceded by a
description of the “matter” name. (Suppl. Sandelmann Decl., ¶ 33.) Mr. Sandelmann’s
supplemental declaration indicates that a number of the “Mixed Matter” time
entries include work related to the “Appeal.” (Ibid.)
The Court finds that the requested $11,776.77 in attorney’s fees incurred in
connection with the subject appeal is reasonable. 
Lastly, as noted by Wolfe, Petitioner provided a breakdown of
attorney’s fees and costs incurred for matters other than the subject appeal
(Case No. B321452), specifically, Bankruptcy Case No. 2:23-bk-11789-BR In
re: Hawthorne Hangar Operations, L.P. (labeled “Bankruptcy”); Hawthorne
Hangar Operations, L.P., et al. v. Production Capital, LLC Case No.
21STCV39700 (labeled “Grand Pacific”); Superior Court Case; Case No.
21STCP00556 (labeled “Superior Court”); and Petitioner’s Writ (B324458) and
related Appeal (B324925) (jointly labeled “Writ”).  (Sandelmann Decl., ¶¶ 10-11, 35.)
However, as discussed, the Court did not find that Petitioner
demonstrated that he is entitled to attorney’s fees and costs against Wolfe in
connection with the subject bankruptcy proceedings. (See June 25, 2024
Order at p. 15:15-17.) As discussed, the Court ordered that it “will require a
supplemental declaration from Petitioner’s counsel more clearly setting forth
the fees incurred by Petitioner solely in connection with the subject appeal in Case
No. B321452.” (June 25, 2024 Order at p. 18:24-26.) 
In addition, Petitioner did not move for attorney’s fees and costs in
connection with the “Grand Pacific,” “Superior Court,” or “Writ” matters. Petitioner’s
instant motion provides, inter alia, that Petitioner “move[s]…for an
award of attorney’s fees…on the grounds that the Court of Appeal, Second
Appellate District affirmed the trial court ruling favoring Wehrly against Dan
Wolfe, as Trustee of the Wolfe Family Trust of 1992 on September 20, 2023…”
(Notice of Mot. at p. 2:1-4.) Petitioner’s motion states that “[o]n June 9,
2022, the HHO Defendants filed an appeal of the Judgment, California Court of
Appeal, Second Appellate District Case No. B321452 (the ‘HHO Appeal’),” and Petitioner
argues that “Wehrly is unquestionably the ‘prevailing Party’ in this matter,
having obtained favorable outcomes of the HHO Appeal and the HHO BK…Therefore,
Wehrly is entitled to the attorneys’ fees he expended during the appeal.” (Mot.
at pp. 2:17-19; 4:22-26.) 
In light of the foregoing, it is unclear why attorney’s fees and costs
incurred for the “Bankruptcy,” “Grand Pacific,” “Superior Court,” and “Writ”
matters are referenced in Mr. Sandelmann’s supplemental declaration. The Court
denies any purported request by Petitioner for attorney’s fees and costs
incurred in the “Bankruptcy,” “Grand Pacific,” “Superior Court,” and “Writ”
matters, as well as any “Mixed Matter[s]” not involving the Appeal. 
            Based on the foregoing, the Court
grants Petitioner’s motion for attorney’s fees in the amount of $55,212.27 ($43,435.50
+ $11,776.77). 
C.    Costs
Petitioner’s notice of
motion asserts that Petitioner “is also entitled to $4,938.19 in costs…”
(Notice of Motion at p. 2:6-7.)[4] The
Court’s June 25, 2024 Order provides that “the Court does not find that
Petitioner has demonstrated that he is entitled to attorney’s fees and costs
against Wolfe in connection with the subject bankruptcy proceedings. Thus, the
Court will
require a supplemental declaration from Petitioner’s counsel setting forth the
costs incurred by Petitioner solely in connection with the subject appeal in Case
No. B321452.” (June 25, 2024 Order at p. 19:14-18.) 
In his supplemental declaration, Mr. Sandelmann states that Petitioner
has incurred $1,858.95 in costs relating to the Appeal through the date of the
remittitur. (Suppl. Sandelmann Decl., ¶ 35(a).) Wolfe does not appear to
challenge this amount, and states that “Wehrly should be limited to recovering
the $1,858.95 in costs incurred on Appeal.” (Suppl. Opp’n at p. 14:26-27.)
Based on the foregoing, the Court grants Petitioner’s motion for costs in the
amount of $1,858.95. 
D.    Interest 
            In the motion, Petitioner also states
that he seeks “interest on the Judgment at a per diem rate of $328.89.”
(Notice of Motion at p. 2:7.) The Court’s June 25, 2024 Order provides “Petitioner
does not appear to explain how such per diem rate was calculated. Thus, the
Court does not find that Petitioner has demonstrated that he is entitled to ‘interest
on the Judgment at a per diem rate of $328.89.’… Petitioner may address this
issue in the supplemental declaration.” (June 25, 2024 Order at pp.
19:23-20:3.) 
            In his supplemental declaration, Mr.
Sandelmann states that “Judgement was entered on May 13, 2022…The amount of the
Judgment was $1,145,130.57,” and that “[s]tarting on May 13, 2022, the Judgment
accrued 10% interest at a per diem rate of $313.73.” (Suppl. Sandelmann Decl.,
¶¶ 36-37, 39.) As noted by Wolfe, Mr. Sandelmann’s supplemental declaration
provides a different interest rate. Wolfe asserts that “[d]espite the Court’s
ruling that Wehrly failed to demonstrate that he is entitled to interest on the
Judgment at a per diem rate of $328.89 and that Wehrly failed to explain how
the per diem rate was calculated, Wehrly’s counsel still failed to explain and
justify the interest calculations.” (Suppl. Opp’n at p. 14:9-13.) Indeed,
Petitioner does not appear to provide such calculations.   
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, Petitioner’s
motion for attorney’s fees and costs is granted in part. The
Court awards Petitioner a total of $57,071.22 in attorney’s fees and costs
($55,212.27 + $1,858.95.) 
Petitioner is to provide notice
of this Order.¿¿
