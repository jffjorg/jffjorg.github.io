This is a tentative ruling by Judge Teresa A. Beaudet in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, Department 50. The case is Rafael Nieves vs. Wasserman Media Group LLC, with case number 23STCP02225. Rafael Nieves, the Petitioner, seeks to vacate an arbitration award issued by Joshua M. Javits, while Wasserman Media Group LLC, the Respondent, seeks to confirm the same award.

The Judge has continued the hearings on the Petitioner's First Amended Petition to Vacate Arbitration Award and the Respondent's Motion to Confirm Arbitration Award due to redactions in the filings. The Judge notes that the parties have not filed a motion to seal the redacted portions of their respective filings, and that the California Rules of Court require a court order before a record can be filed under seal.

The Judge orders the parties to file unredacted versions of their filings if they do not seek to seal them, and to immediately file a motion or application to seal if they do seek to seal their filings. The hearing has been continued to a later date, and Petitioner is ordered to give notice of this order.
