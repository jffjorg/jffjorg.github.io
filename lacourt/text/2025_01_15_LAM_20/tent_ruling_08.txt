 On June 20, 2024, Plaintiffs Annette Hoskins, Annice Allen, and Jimice Allen filed the operative Complaint against Defendants Donna Barzella Stevens, individually and as trustee of the Donna Stevens Trust, and Dean A. Shaw for (1) breach of implied warranty of habitability, (2) statutory violation of warranty of habitability, (3) breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment, (4) negligence, (5) violation of Civ. Code § 1942.4, (6) private nuisance, (7) violation of Long Beach Ordinance no. ORD 20-0044, and (8) violation of the UCL. Defendants Donna Barzella Stevens, individually and as trustee of the Donna Stevens Trust, and Dean A. Shaw now seek to strike the Complaint’s references to punitive damages.  No opposition was filed.Motions to strike are used to challenge defects in the pleadings not subject to demurrer.  Any party may move to strike the whole or any part of a pleading within the time allotted to respond to the pleading.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 435(b)(1).)  The grounds for a motion to strike shall appear on the face of the challenged pleading or from any matter of which the Court is required to take judicial notice.  (Id. § 437(a).)  The Court may strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading, and strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.  (Id. § 436.)  An “irrelevant” matter includes any “demand for judgment requesting relief not supported by the allegations of the complaint or cross-complaint.”  (Id. § 431.10(b)(3), (c); see also Smith v. Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1033, 1036-1042.)Punitive damages are available when the plaintiff establishes oppression, fraud, or malice by clear and convincing evidence.  (Civ. Code § 3294(a).)  Malice means “conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.”  (Civ. Code § 3294(c)(1).)  In this context, despicable conduct is conduct considered “so vile, base, contemptible, miserable, wretched or loathsome that it would be looked down upon and despised by ordinary decent people.”  (Scott v. Phoenix Schools, Inc. (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 702, 715, internal quotation marks omitted.)  Oppression means “despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person’s rights.”  (Civ. Code § 3294(c)(2).)  Fraud means “an intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact known to the defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.”  (Id. § 3294(c)(3).)“[M]alice does not require actual intent to harm. (Id. at p. 895, 157 Cal.Rptr. 693, 598 P.2d 854.) Conscious disregard for the safety of another may be sufficient where the defendant is aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his or her conduct and he or she willfully fails to avoid such consequences. (Id. at pp. 895–896, 157 Cal.Rptr. 693, 598 P.2d 854.) Malice may be proved either expressly through direct evidence or by implication through indirect evidence from which the jury draws inferences.”  (Angie M. v. Superior Ct. (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1228.)“[T]he operative complaint . . . must include specific factual allegations showing that defendant's conduct was oppressive, fraudulent, or malicious to support a claim for punitive damages. (Brousseau v. Jarrett (1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 864, 872 [141 Cal.Rptr. 200].) Punitive damages may not be pleaded generally.”  (Today's IV, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cnty. Metro. Transportation Auth. (2022) 83 Cal. App. 5th 1137, 1193.)Here, Plaintiffs fail to allege actual facts indicating that they notified Defendants of the substandard conditions but that Defendants, knowing the harm that might be caused, thereafter refused to remediate the issues.  Thus, the Motion to Strike is granted, with 20 days leave to amend.Moving party to give notice.
