ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background
 
On February 23,
2023, Plaintiff Maxwell + Bessie, Inc. (“MB”) filed an action against Defendant
Michael Onagbesan aka Abayomi Oladapo Onagbesan, dba Ona International Inc.,
Onas Inc., and Onas Media Network (“Onagbesan”) for breach of written and oral
agreements and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,
arising out of three alleged agreements between the parties.  Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint on June
27, 2023.
 
On August 3, 2023, Defendant, in
propria persona, filed a General Denial.
 
On March 8,
2024, Plaintiff filed the following discovery motions: (1) Motion to Compel
Defendant’s Initial Responses to Specially Prepared Interrogatories (Set 1) and
(2) Motion to Compel Defendant’s Initial Responses to Request for Production
(Set 1).  On April 18, 2024, the Court
granted both of the discovery motions and ordered Defendant to serve responses
within 20 days of notice of the Court’s order.
 
On June 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant Motion for Evidence Sanctions against Defendant (“Motion”).  No opposition has been filed.  
 
II.                
Legal Standard
 
Where a party willfully
disobeys a discovery order, courts have discretion to impose terminating,
issue, evidence, or monetary sanctions. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.010(d), (g), 2023.030; R.S. Creative, Inc. v.
Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 495.)
 
Code of Civil Procedure § 2023.040
requires that “[a] request for a sanction shall, in the notice of motion,
identify every person, party, and attorney against whom the sanction is sought,
and specify the type of sanction sought.” 
Furthermore, the notice of motion shall be supported by a memorandum of
points and authorities, and accompanied by a declaration setting forth facts
supporting the amount of any monetary sanction sought.  (Code of Civ. Proc. § 2023.040.)
 
Monetary sanctions may be
imposed “ordering
that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney
advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney's fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct…unless [the
Court] finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”  (Code of Civ. Proc. § 2023.030(a).)
 
Issue sanctions may be
imposed “ordering that designated facts shall be taken as established in the
action in accordance with the claim of the party adversely affected by the
misuse of the discovery process. The court may also impose an issue sanction by
an order prohibiting any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process
from supporting or opposing designated claims or defenses.”  (Code of Civ. Proc. § 2023.030(b).)
 
Evidence sanctions may be
imposed “by
an order prohibiting any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process
from introducing designated matters in evidence.”  (Code of Civ. Proc. § 2023.030(c).)
 
In more extreme cases, the Court may also impose
terminating sanctions by “striking out the pleadings or parts of the
pleadings,” “staying further proceedings,” “dismissing the action, or any part
of the action,” or “rending a judgment by default” against the party misusing
the discovery process.  (Code of Civ.
Proc. § 2023.030(d).)  The court should
look to the totality of the circumstances in determining whether terminating
sanctions are appropriate.  (Lang v.
Hochman (2000) 77¿Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.) 
Ultimate discovery sanctions are justified where there is a willful
discovery order violation, a history of abuse, and evidence showing that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with discovery rules.  (Van Sickle v. Gilbert (2011)
196¿Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.)  “[A]
penalty as severe as dismissal or default is not authorized where noncompliance
with discovery is caused by an inability to comply rather than willfulness or
bad faith.”  (Brown v. Sup. Ct.
(1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 701, 707.) 
“Although in extreme cases a court has the authority to order a
terminating sanction as a first measure [citations], a terminating sanction
should generally not be imposed until the court has attempted less severe
alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly shows
lesser sanctions would be ineffective.” 
(Lopez v. Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc.
(2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566, 604-605.)
 
In City of Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC, the Court ruled
that Code of Civil Procedure §§ 2023.010 and 2023.030 list the available
discovery sanctions but do not independently authorize a court to impose
specific sanctions.  (PriceewaterhouseCoopers
(2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 503-504.) 
Thus, a court’s authority to impose the sanctions specified in
§§ 2023.010 and 2023.030 must arise from a statute governing a particular
method of discovery.  (Ibid.)
 
III.             
Discussion
 
Plaintiff moves for a court order imposing evidentiary
sanctions against Defendant for failure to comply with the Court’s April 18,
2024, Order.
 
Plaintiff’s counsel, James
Lee Reynolds, states that on the same day as the Court’s Order, Plaintiff
served, via regular US mail and email, Defendant with the Notices of Court
rulings ordering him to comply with the discovery requests within twenty days
of the Order.  (Reynolds Decl. ¶ 2, Ex. 2.)  Factoring in service time, Defendant’s Code-compliant
responses had to be served no later than May 20, 2024.  (Ibid. at ¶ 3.)  Around April 22, 2024, Defendant served “a
non-descriptive pile of documents, with bate-stamped numbers 1 through
145.”  (Ibid. at ¶ 4, Ex. 3.)  On April 21, 2024, Defendant sent an email to
Plaintiff indicating that some of the documents he had mailed had been returned
to him; this was due to a missing unit number in the address.  (Ibid. at ¶ 5, Ex. 4.)  By May 20, 2024, Plaintiff had not received
the Court ordered verified, Code-compliant initial responses and production
.  (Ibid. at ¶¶ 6-7, Ex. 5.).
Counsel states that it is not clear from the “pile of non-descriptive legal
documents” if these documents are a response to the discovery as the caption
lists October 31, 2023, and does not identify which document is a responsive
document to a requested category.  (Ibid.
at ¶ 8.)
 
Plaintiff requests that Defendant be prohibited from
placing the following into evidence:
 
1)      1.1:
All facts, witnesses, documents, custodian of documents, physical evidence, and
custodian of physical evidence supporting Defendant’s non-liability as to
Plaintiff’s First Cause of Action (Breach of Written Agreement).
2)      1.2:
All facts, witnesses, documents, custodian of documents, physical evidence, and
custodian of physical evidence supporting Defendant’s non-liability as to
Plaintiff’s Second Cause of Action (Breach of Oral Agreement).
3)      1.3:
All facts, witnesses, documents, custodian of documents, physical evidence, and
custodian of physical evidence supporting Defendant’s non-liability as to
Plaintiff s Third Cause of Action (Breach of Oral Agreement).
4)      1.4:
All facts, witnesses, documents, custodian of documents, physical evidence, and
custodian of physical evidence supporting Defendant’s non-liability as to
Plaintiff’s Fourth Cause of Action (Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith).
5)      1.5:
Any document, communication, audio media, visual media, physical evidence or
electronic media that mentions, refers to, or relates to (which as to each is
discoverable by a reasonable search and inquiry) Plaintiff’s claims in this
action (starting January 1, 2020, to the present).
6)      1.6:
Any document, communication, audio media, visual media, physical evidence or
electronic media that mentions, refers to, or relates to (which as to each is
discoverable by a reasonable search and inquiry) to any communication between
Defendant and Plaintiff regarding Plaintiff’s claims in this action (starting
January 1, 2020, to the present).
7)      1.7:
Any document, communication, audio media, visual media, physical evidence or
electronic media that mentions, refers to, or relates to (which as to each is
discoverable by a reasonable search and inquiry) to any notes between Defendant
and Plaintiff regarding Plaintiff’s claims in this action (starting January
1,2020, to the present).
8)      1.8:
Any document, communication, audio media, visual media, physical evidence or
electronic media that mentions, refers to, or relates to (which as to each is
discoverable by a reasonable search and inquiry) to any payment of monies by
Defendant to Plaintiff regarding Plaintiff’s claims in this action (starting
January 1, 2020, to the present).
9)      1.9:
Any document, communication, audio media, visual media, physical evidence or
electronic media that mentions, refers to, or relates to (which as to each is
discoverable by a reasonable search and inquiry) Defendant’s alleged
non-liability to Plaintiff regarding Plaintiff’s claims in this action
(starting January 1,2020, to the present).
10)  1.10: Any
document, communication, audio media, visual media, physical evidence or
electronic media that mentions, refers to, or relates to (which as to each is
discoverable by a reasonable search and inquiry) documents required to be
identified and disclosed in response to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories,
Set 1.
11)  1.11: Any
document, communication, audio media, visual media, physical evidence or
electronic media that mentions, refers to, or relates to (which as to each is
discoverable by a reasonable search and inquiry) physical evidence required to
be identified and disclosed in response to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories,
Set 1.
 
Plaintiff argues that evidence sanctions are proper
and appropriate, and a showing of willfulness is not required.  (Mot. p. 7.) 
Defendant was served with the Special Interrogatories and Request for
Production around August 4, 2023, and was subsequently ordered to provide
verified, Code-compliant initial responses. 
(Ibid. at pp. 8-9.) 
However, as of the date of the instant Motion, Defendant has refused to
comply with the discovery request and the Court’s Order.  (Ibid. at pp. 8-9.)  Thus, the Court should prohibit Defendant
from introducing any evidence at trial relating to the categories listed in the
Motion.  (Ibid. at p. 9.)
 
            Defendant
has not opposed the Motion.
 
Code of Civil Procedure § 2030.290 governs the imposition
of sanctions in regard to failure to respond to interrogatories.  Section 2030.290(c) states that:
 
The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or
in addition to that sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).
 
(Code of Civ. Proc. § 2030.290(c), emphasis added.)
 
Similarly, Code of Civil Procedure § 2031.300 governs the
imposition of sanctions in regard to failure to respond to a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling. 
Section 2031.300(c) states:
 
… the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order
compelling a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including
the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or
in addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).
 
(Code of Civ. Proc. § 2031.300(c), emphasis added.)
 
Based on §§ 2030.290(c) and 2031.300(c), the Court has
authority to impose any of the sanctions specified in § 2030.030.
 
When determining whether evidentiary sanctions are
appropriate, merely failing to obey a Court order is sufficient and a showing
of willful disobedience is not required. 
(Aghaian v. Minassian, 64 Cal.App.5th 603, 618-620.)  The Court has discretion to determine whether
sanctions are appropriate.  (Code of Civ.
Proc. §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.)
 
Code of Civil Procedure §§
2030.210 through 2030.310 set forth the requirements for providing
Code-compliant responses to interrogatories. 
Similarly, §§ 2031.210 through 2031.310 set forth the requirements for
providing Code-compliant responses to a request for production.  Plaintiff argues that the Defendant has
disobeyed the Court’s Order compelling compliance with Plaintiff’s discovery
requests because he has served “a non-descriptive pile of documents” and, as a
result, seeks evidentiary sanctions regarding eleven matters that prohibit
Defendant from presenting any evidence regarding non-liability or relating to
Plaintiff’s claims.
 
In Rutledge v.
Hewlett-Packard Co., the Court reaffirmed the trial court’s broad
discretion when imposing discovery sanctions. 
(Rutledge, 238 Cal.App.4th 1164, 1193.)  The Court explained that this discretion must
be exercised for the purpose of compelling disclosure of discoverable
information not solely to punish the offending party.  (Ibid.)  Moreover, “the sanction chosen should not provide a windfall to the
other party, by putting the prevailing party in a better position than if he or
she had obtained the discovery sought and it had been favorable.  [Citations.]” 
(Ibid.)  In Rutledge, the Court found that the trial court’s refusal to order
evidentiary sanctions, despite seven prior orders to comply with discovery, was
not an abuse of discretion because if sanctions had been granted, they “would
provide a windfall to appellants relieving them of their burden of proving
their theory of liability.”  (Ibid.
at 1194.)
 
First,
the Court notes that Plaintiff has not submitted any of the documents produced
by Defendant and characterized as a “non-descriptive pile of documents” other
than Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration claiming that the responses are not Code-compliant.  Second, the evidentiary sanctions
sought are broad and prohibit Defendant from producing any evidence regarding
liability or relating to Plaintiff’s claims, thus, eliminating Plaintiff’s
burden to prove their case.  These
sanctions will not serve the purpose of compelling the disclosure of
discoverable information, but instead, will provide a windfall to the
Plaintiff. Accordingly, the Court does not find that the evidentiary sanctions
sought are appropriate at this stage in the proceedings.
 
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motion for Evidence Sanctions is denied.
 
IV.             
Conclusion & Order
 
For the
foregoing reasons,
 
Plaintiff Maxwell + Bessie, Inc.’s Motion for Evidence
Sanctions is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.  
 
The Parties are ordered to meet and confer via
telephone regarding outstanding discovery responses, including a discussion as
to which documents produced to date i.e. “non-descriptive pile of documents” pertain
to items 1.1 through 1.11, within the next 20 days.  
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
