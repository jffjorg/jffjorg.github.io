ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background
 
On July 21, 2023, Plaintiff Allen R.
King (“Plaintiff”) filed an action against Defendant Menachem Grossbaum
(“Defendant”) for breach of contract and common counts.  Plaintiff alleges that he was hired to
perform legal services for Defendant, but Defendant failed to pay Plaintiff’s
legal fees and costs.
 
On August 23, 2023, Defendant filed a
Notice of Stay of Proceedings due to arbitration of attorney fees and costs
under Business and Professions Code § 6201. 
The Court notes that Defendant did not file a motion or petition to
compel arbitration and did not attach a copy of request for arbitration to the
Notice, as required.
On June 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to
Terminate Stay of Proceedings.
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
II.                
Legal
Standard
 
A party may seek a court order
compelling the parties to arbitrate a dispute covered by the agreement.  (Code of Civ. Proc. § 1281.2.)  Generally, the court must grant the request
unless it finds either (1) no written agreement to arbitrate exists; (2) the
right to compel arbitration has been waived; (3) grounds exist for revocation
of the agreement; or (4) litigation is pending that may render the arbitration
unnecessary or create conflicting¿rulings on common issues.
 
When seeking to compel arbitration, the
initial burden lies with the moving party to demonstrate the existence of a
valid arbitration agreement by prepondernace of evidence.  (Ruiz v. Moss Bros. Auto Group (2014)
232 Cal.App.4th 836, 841-42; Gamboa v. Northeast Community Clinic (2021), 72 Cal.App.5th 158, 164-65.)  It is sufficient for the moving
party to produce a copy of the arbitration agreement or set forth the
agreement’s provisions.  (Gamboa,
72 Cal.App.5th at 165.)  The
burden then shifts to the opposing party to prove by a preponderance of
evidence any defense to enforcement of the contract or the arbitration clause.  (Ruiz, 232 Cal.App.4th at 842; Gamboa,
72 Cal.App.5th at 165.)  Subsequently,
the moving party must establish with the preponderance of admissible evidence a
valid arbitration agreement between the parties.  (Ibid.)  The trial court then weighs all the evidence
submitted and uses its discretion to make a final determination.  (Ibid.)  “California law, ‘like [federal law], reflects
a strong policy favoring arbitration agreements and requires close judicial
scrutiny of waiver claims.’”  (Wagner Const. Co. v. Pacific Mechanical
Corp. (2007) 41 Cal.4th 19, 31.)  If
the court orders arbitration, then the court shall stay the action until
arbitration is completed.  (See Code Civ. Proc. § 1281.4.)
 
III.             
Discussion
 
Plaintiff moves for a court order
terminating the stay of proceedings in the instant case.  He states that Defendant requested
arbitration with the Attorney-Client Mediation and Arbitration Services (ACMAS)
of the Los Angeles County Bar and subsequently filed a Notice of Stay of
Proceedings with the Court.  (King Decl.
¶ 3.)  On November 6, 2023, Plaintiff
received an email from the ACMAS case coordinator notifying him that Defendant
did not wish to move forward with the arbitration.  (Ibid. at ¶ 4.)  Since then, Plaintiff has not received any
additional communication regarding the arbitration.  (Ibid. at ¶ 5.)
 
The Court finds
Plaintiff’s Motion to be moot.  Given
that Defendant did not follow the proper procedure to stay the proceedings by
seeking a court order compelling arbitration, the proceedings were not stayed
and trial is currently set for January 17, 2025.
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to
Terminate Stay of Proceedings is denied as moot.
 
IV.             
Conclusion
& Order
 
For the reasons
discussed above,
 
Plaintiff Allen R.
King’s Motion to Terminate Stay
of Proceedings is DENIED as MOOT.
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
