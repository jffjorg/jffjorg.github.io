I.                   
Background
 
On March 14, 2024, Petitioner Cordova
Estates (“Petitioner”) filed the instant Petition to Declare Mobile Home
Abandoned (“Petition”) against Respondents Laverle Minnie Durham (“Durham”) and
Michael Len Coutu (“Coutu”).  Pursuant to
Civil Code § 798.61, Petitioner seeks a declaration that the mobilehome located
at 27361 Sierra Highway Space 246, Canyon Country, CA 91351, described as 1965 American,
Decal Number AAK2033, Serial No. S53323/S53323B (“Mobile Home”) is
abandoned.  (Pet. ¶ 5.)  Petitioner also seeks storage charges in the
amount of $916.80 per month owed from August 1, 2023.  (Ibid. at ¶ 6.)
 
On June 27, 2024, default was entered against Defendant
Coutu and on July 16, 2024, default was entered against Defendant Durham.
 
No opposition has been filed.

Legal
Standard & Discussion 
 
A.    Determination of “Abandoned Mobilehome”—Civ. Code § 798.61(a)(1)
 
            Pursuant
to Civil Code § 798.61(a)(1), an “‘abandoned mobilehome’ means a mobilehome
about which all of the following are true:
 
(A) It is located in a mobilehome park
on a site for which no rent has been paid to the management for the preceding
60 days.
 
(B) It is unoccupied.
 
(C) A reasonable person would believe
it to be abandoned.
 
(D) It is not permanently affixed to
the land.”
 
            Petitioner submits the declaration
of Nancy Must, Property Supervisor for Cordova Estates.  (Must Decl. ¶ 3.)  According to Must and the California
Department of Housing and Community Development, the agency responsible for
licensing and titling mobilehomes, Respondents Durham and Couto are the
registered owners of the mobilehome located at 27361 Sierra Highway Space 246,
Canyon Country, CA 91351, described as 1965 American[1],
Decal Number AAK2033, Serial No. S53323/S53323. 
(Ibid. at ¶¶ 5-6, Ex. 2.) 
There are no legal owners of the mobilehome.  (Ibid. at ¶ 5.)
 
            Must explains that, to the best of her
knowledge and belief, the Mobilehome is unoccupied and was unoccupied prior to September
5, 2023, the date of posting the 30-Day Notice. 
(Ibid. at ¶¶ 7-8, Ex. 1.) 
The Mobilehome is not permanently affixed to the space and is located in
the Park on a site for which no rent or storage fees have been paid since July
2023.  (Ibid. at ¶¶ 6, 8.)
 
            The Court finds that
the Mobilehome falls within the Civil Code § 798.61’s definition of
“abandoned.” 
 
B.     Notice of Belief of Abandonment—Civ. Code § 798.61(b)
 
Civil Code § 798.61(b) requires: 
 
“After
determining a mobilehome in a mobilehome park to be an abandoned mobilehome,
the management shall post a notice of belief of abandonment on the mobilehome
for not less than 30 days, and shall deposit copies of the notice in the United
States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the homeowner at the last known
address and to any known registered owner, if different from the homeowner, and
to any known holder of a security interest in the abandoned mobilehome.  This notice shall be mailed by registered or
certified mail with a return receipt requested.”
 
On September 5, 2023, a 30-day Notice
of Belief of Abandonment was posted on the Mobilehome.  (Must Decl. ¶ 8, Ex. 1; 6-27-24 Proofs of
Service - Trevillyan Decl. ¶¶ 2-3.)  On
the same day, the Notice was mailed via certified mail, return receipt
requested, to Respondents at 27361 Sierra Highway Space 246, Canyon
Country, CA 91351.  (Ibid.)
 
The Court finds that Petitioner has
satisfied the requirements of § 798.61(b).
 
C.     Petition for Judicial Declaration—Civ. Code § 798.61(c)
 
Civil Code § 798.61(c)(1) states:
 
“Thirty or more days following posting pursuant to subdivision
(b), the management may file a petition in the superior court in the county in
which the mobilehome park is located, for a judicial declaration of abandonment
of the mobilehome. A proceeding under this subdivision is a limited civil case.
Copies of the petition shall be served upon the homeowner, any known registered
owner, and any known person having a lien or security interest of record in the
mobilehome by posting a copy on the mobilehome and mailing copies to those
persons at their last known addresses by registered or certified mail with a
return receipt requested in the United States mail, postage prepaid.”
 
On March 14, 2024, more than 30 days
after posting and serving the Notice of Belief of Abandonment, Petitioner filed
the instant Petition.  Petitioner has
submitted proof that the Petition was served on Respondents Durham and Coutu on
May 18, 2024, by posting a copy of the Petition at 27361 Sierra Highway Space
246, Canyon Country, CA 91351, and mailing the Petition to the same address via
certified mail, return receipt requested. 
(6-17-24 Proofs of Service.)  It
appears that the envelope addressed to Coutu was returned to sender indicating
that he is deceased, and the envelope addressed to Durham has been returned to
sender as there is no mail receptable.  (Ibid.
at p. 3.)
 
            The
Court finds the service requirements of § 798.61(c) have been satisfied.
 
D.   
Charges,
Attorney’s Fees, and Costs
 
Civil Code § 798.61(d)(2) states:
 
“If, at the hearing, the petitioner shows by a preponderance
of the evidence that the criteria for an abandoned mobilehome has been
satisfied and no party establishes an interest therein at the hearing and
tenders all past due rent and other charges, the court shall enter a judgment
of abandonment, determine the amount of charges to which the petitioner is
entitled, and award attorney's fees and costs to the petitioner.”
 
Petitioner seeks monthly storage charges of $916.80 per
month for eleven (11) months, from August 1, 2023, through June 2024, for a
total of $10,084.80.  (Must Decl. ¶¶ 9-10.)  The monthly charge is calculated based on the
amount of rent Respondents were paying for the space at the time the Mobilehome
was abandoned.  (Ibid., Ex. 3.)  Petitioner argues that the amount requested
is reasonable because a similarly sized mobilehome would incur storage charges
of $86.50 per day in the City of Los Angles, totaling $2,595.00 per month.  (Ibid. at ¶ 10.)
 
Petitioner also seeks attorney’s
fees and costs but does not request a specific sum.  (Pet. p. 3.) 
In its proposed order, Petitioner lists costs of $225.  This represents the cost of filing.  
 
The Court finds the storage charges
requested to be reasonable and grants Petitioner’s request for storage charges
in the amount of $10,084.80, plus $225 for costs. 
 
The Court notes that the proposed
order lists an erroneous description of the mobilehome as “1992
Goldenwest.”  Petitioner is ordered to
file a corrected proposed order.
 
III.             
Conclusion
& Order
 
For the foregoing reasons,
 
Petitioner Cordova Estates’s unopposed
Petition to Declare Mobilehome Abandoned is GRANTED.  Petitioner is awarded $10,084.80 in storage
charges plus $225 for costs, for a total of $10,309.80.
 
Judgment for Abandonment is signed,
filed and entered herein this date.
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
