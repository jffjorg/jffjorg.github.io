Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the plaintiff's motion to terminate the stay of proceedings in this case. The plaintiff is seeking to terminate the stay because the defendant did not follow the proper procedure to stay the proceedings by seeking a court order compelling arbitration. The court finds that the motion is moot because the proceedings were not stayed and trial is currently set for January 17, 2025. Therefore, the court denies the plaintiff's motion to terminate the stay of proceedings as moot.
