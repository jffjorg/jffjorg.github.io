The court has reviewed the petition filed by Cordova Estates to declare a mobile home abandoned, and has found that the mobile home meets the criteria for abandonment under California Civil Code § 798.61. The court has also found that Petitioner has satisfied the requirements of the code section, including posting and mailing a 30-Day Notice of Belief of Abandonment and serving the petition on the defendants.

As a result, the court grants Petitioner's request for a declaration that the mobile home is abandoned, and orders Petitioner to pay storage charges in the amount of $10,084.80, plus $225 for costs. The court also notes that the proposed order lists an erroneous description of the mobile home, and orders Petitioner to file a corrected proposed order.
