Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the plaintiff's motion for evidence sanctions against the defendant for failure to comply with discovery orders. The defendant has failed to serve verified, Code-compliant initial responses to discovery requests and instead served a "non-descriptive pile of documents" that did not comply with discovery requests.

The Court finds that the evidentiary sanctions sought by the plaintiff are too broad and would eliminate the plaintiff's burden to prove their case. Therefore, the motion for evidence sanctions is denied without prejudice.

The parties are ordered to meet and confer regarding outstanding discovery responses, including a discussion as to which documents produced to date pertain to the items listed in the motion.
