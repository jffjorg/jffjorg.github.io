DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D., Inc. (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an
order (1) compelling defendant Yang Lu (“Defendant”) to serve responses to
Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set 12, and (2) awarding
monetary sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of
$4,079.15.
If a party to whom a demand for inspection is directed fails to serve
a timely response to it, the party making the demand may move for an order
compelling response to the demand.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) 
On November 10, 2023, Plaintiff electronically served its Requests for
Production of Documents, Set 12 on Defendant. 
(Chan Decl., Ex. A, p. 8 [proof of service].)  Defendant did not serve responses as of the
date that Plaintiff filed this motion. 
(Mot., p. 3:3-4.)  The court notes
that Defendant does not appear to dispute that she did not serve responses to
this discovery, instead arguing that Plaintiff seeks information and documents
protected by the attorney-client privilege. 
(Opp., pp. 3:8-16.)  However, Defendant
has not presented sufficient argument or authority establishing that she was
not required to serve responses on this ground. 
To the extent that the document demands seek privileged information,
Defendant should have served objections to assert the privilege. 
In reply, Plaintiff has presented evidence showing that Defendant has since
served responses to this discovery, on July 19, 2024.  (Chan Reply Decl., ¶ 6.)  However, the responses asserted
objections.  (Chan Reply Decl., Ex.
G.)  Because Defendant did not serve
timely responses, Defendant has “waive[d] any objection to the demand[s],
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product . . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(a).)  Thus, the court finds that
Plaintiff is entitled to an order directing Defendant to serve responses to its
Requests for Production of Documents, without objections, and therefore grants
Plaintiff’s motion.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (b).) 
The court grants Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(c).)  The court finds that $2,186.65 ((3.5
hours x attorney Chan’s $425 hourly rate) + (1.5 hours x attorney Takhsh’s $425
hourly rate) + $61.65 filing fee) is a reasonable amount of sanctions to impose
against Defendant in connection with this motion.  (Chan Decl., ¶¶ 7-8.)  The court finds that the circumstances
presented make the imposition of the additional $1,000 sanction requested by
Plaintiff pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.050 unjust.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.050, subds. (a),
(c).) 
            The court denies Defendant’s request
for monetary sanctions.
ORDER
            The court grants plaintiff Seran Ng,
D.M.D., Inc.’s motion to compel responses to requests for production of
documents and for monetary sanctions. 
            Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2031.300, the court orders defendant Yang Lu (1) to serve on plaintiff
Seran Ng, D.M.D., Inc. full and complete verified responses, without
objections, to plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D., Inc.’s Requests for Production of
Documents, Set 12, that comply with Code of Civil Procedure sections
2031.210-2031.250, and (2) to produce to plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D., Inc. all
documents and things in defendant Yang Lu’s possession, custody, or control
which are responsive to those requests, within 20 days of the date of this
order. 
            The court orders defendant Yang Lu
to pay monetary sanctions to plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D., Inc. in the amount of
$2,186.65 within 30 days of the date of this order. 
            The court orders plaintiff Seran Ng,
D.M.D., Inc. to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  August 1, 2024
