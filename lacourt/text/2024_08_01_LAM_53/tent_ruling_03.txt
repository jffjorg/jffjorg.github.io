court notes that Defendant has also asserted that the court should grant
summary adjudication in its favor on Plaintiff’s “derivative fourth cause of
action for failure to prevent discrimination and/or retaliation . . . .”  (Mot., p. 10:5-11.)  However, Plaintiff has alleged only three
causes of action for (1) discrimination in violation of the Fair Employment and
Housing Act (Gov. Code, § 12900 et seq.) (“FEHA”), (2) harassment in violation
of FEHA, and (3) retaliation in violation of FEHA.  (Compl., pp. 7:13-15, 8:20-22, 10:1-3.)

Defendant does not dispute that Plaintiff complained to Sergeant Williams
directly about his discriminatory conduct. 
(UMF No. 59.)
