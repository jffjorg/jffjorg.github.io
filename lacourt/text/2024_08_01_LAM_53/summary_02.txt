And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the defendant's motion for summary adjudication on all three causes of action. With regards to the first cause of action for discrimination, the court found that the defendant did not meet its burden to show that the alleged discriminatory actions were taken for legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons. The court also found that the plaintiff had met his burden to show that a triable issue of material fact existed as to the element of causation and pretext.

With regards to the second cause of action for harassment, the court found that the defendant did not meet its burden to show that the alleged harassing conduct was not severe or pervasive enough to create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment. The court also found that the plaintiff had met his burden to show that a triable issue of material fact existed as to the element of severe and pervasive harassing conduct based on race.

With regards to the third cause of action for retaliation, the court found that the defendant did not meet its burden to show that the alleged retaliatory actions were taken for legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons. The court also found that the plaintiff had met his burden to show that a triable issue of material fact existed as to the elements of causation and pretext.
