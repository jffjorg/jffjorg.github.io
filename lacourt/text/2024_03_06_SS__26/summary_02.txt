And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Motion to Vacate Renewal of Judgment filed by Judgment Debtor Taylor Kuo-Tai Hsu. The Motion is denied due to several reasons. Firstly, the Motion is not accompanied by proof of service demonstrating that the moving papers or notice of the hearing date were served on Judgment Creditor. Secondly, the Motion does not provide any legal authority for the requested relief from the renewal of judgment. Finally, the Motion appears to have been brought by Judgment Debtor's daughter, which is not permitted. The Judge has also noted that Judgment Debtor failed to provide a memorandum as required by the Rules of Court, and that the statute cited by Judgment Debtor does not speak to the Court's authority to order Judgment Creditor to reduce the lien amount or reconsider the hardship waiver.
