Here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies Defendant Pilar Devries' Motion to Vacate Default and Default Judgment, requesting sanctions. The ruling is based on the Court's analysis of the motion and opposition. The Court notes that the motion was filed under Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5, which allows a party to vacate a default or default judgment if service of the summons was not actual notice in time to defend the action. The Court finds that Defendant failed to show lack of actual notice through evidence, including utility bills or a lease agreement, to support the claim that she was living at 822 Euclid Street, Santa Monica, California at the time of service. The Court also finds that the motion's claim of extrinsic fraud is too conclusory and lacks evidence to support the claim that Plaintiff was aware of Defendant's new address. Therefore, the Court denies the motion and the request for sanctions.
