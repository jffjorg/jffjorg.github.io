And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the complaint filed by 5850 Avalon LLC against Project Metals, Power Fasteners, and Patrick Harrington. The court has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, meaning that the defendants' objections to the complaint are valid, but the plaintiff has the opportunity to revise and refile the complaint.

The court's decision is based on the defendants' argument that the plaintiff failed to provide legally adequate notice of the 3-day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit, as required by California Code of Civil Procedure section 1161(2). The notice in question contained conflicting rental amounts, which the court found was a material defect.

The court has given the plaintiff 30 days to file and serve a first amended complaint, and has given the defendants 30 days to file and serve a response to the amended complaint. The court has also noted that the parties may submit on the tentative ruling by emailing the courtroom before the hearing date.
