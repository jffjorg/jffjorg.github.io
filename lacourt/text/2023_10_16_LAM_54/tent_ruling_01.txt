T/R:      THE PETITION IS GRANTED. 
 
PLAINTIFFS TO NOTICE.
 
If the parties
wish to submit on the tentative, please email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with notice to opposing
counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the day of the
hearing. 
 
The Court considers the petition.  No opposition has been received.
 
Compromises of disputed claims brought by minors are governed in part by
CCP § 372. The statute allows a guardian ad litem to appear in court on behalf
of a minor claimant and gives the guardian ad litem the power to compromise the
minor’s claim “with the approval of the court in which the action or proceeding
is pending.”  A petition for court
approval of a compromise must be verified by the petitioner and must contain a
full disclosure of all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness
of the compromise or covenant.  (CRC Rule
7.950.)
 
CRC Rule 7.952(a) requires the attendance of the petitioner and claimant
at the hearing on the compromise of the claim unless the court for good causes
dispenses with their personal appearance.
 
“Neither section 372 nor the California Rules of Court (rules 7.950
& 7.952) contemplates a noticed motion and adversary hearing when court
approval of a minor's compromise is sought. Although we need not decide the
question, it would appear that a petition to approve or disapprove a minor's
compromise may be decided by the superior court, ex parte, in chambers.”  (Pearson v. Superior Court (2012) 202
Cal. App. 4th 1333, 1337.)  
 
Minor Plaintiff moves for approval of a settlement with Defendant
Gambier Investment, LLC which Minor Plaintiff would receive $25,000.00 of a
total settlement of $73,111.00. Attorneys’ fees of $7,500.00 will be
deducted from the minor claimant’s settlement amounts.  Minor claimant’s net proceeds are $17,500.00.
The settlement funds will be deposited into a blocked account.
 
This is a landlord-tenant action. Having reviewed the petition, the
Court finds that the individual settlement is fair in light alleged injuries
sustained by claimant. The petition is GRANTED.
