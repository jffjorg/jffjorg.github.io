BACKGROUND
                
On August 23, 2023, Plaintiff 5850
Avalon LLC filed a commercial unlawful detainer complaint against Defendants
Project Metals, Power Fasteners, and Patrick Harrington.
 
ANALYSIS
 
A demurrer to a complaint may be taken
to the whole complaint or to any of the causes of action in it.  (CCP § 430.50(a).)  A demurrer challenges only the legal
sufficiency of the complaint, not the truth of its factual allegations or the
plaintiff's ability to prove those allegations. 
(Picton v. Anderson Union High Sch. Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.
App. 4th 726, 732.)  The court must treat
as true the complaint's material factual allegations, but not contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law. 
(Id. at 732-33.)  The
complaint is to be construed liberally to determine whether a cause of action
has been stated.  (Id. at 733.)
 
Defendants demur to the complaint on
the ground that Plaintiff failed to provide legally adequate notice of the
3-day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit. Defendants assert that the notice itself and
the notice and complaint contain conflicting rental amounts purportedly due. 
 
CCP § 1161(2) provides in pertinent
part, “When the tenant continues in possession, in person or by subtenant,
without the permission of the landlord, or the successor in estate of the
landlord, if applicable, after default in the payment of rent, pursuant to the
lease or agreement under which the property is held, and three days' notice,
excluding Saturdays and Sundays and other judicial holidays, in writing,
requiring its payment, stating the amount that is due, the name, telephone
number, and address of the person to whom the rent payment shall be made...”
 
The notice states that past due rent
amounts to $112,500.00 in the body of the notice and $105,000.00 in the
itemization. In opposition, Plaintiff asserts this does not conflict because
Defendants “knew” the true amount due is $112,500.00 and the discrepancy is
explained by Defendants’ partial payment of rent before the notice was served.
These facts are not alleged in the complaint. It is immaterial what Defendants
purportedly “knew” regarding the amount of rent due as it relates to the
contents of the notice pay or quit. Plaintiff has failed to allege proper
notice.
 
Defendants’ demurrer is SUSTAINED with
leave to amend.
