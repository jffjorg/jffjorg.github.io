And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for relief from potential jury waiver. The plaintiff was injured in a car accident caused by the defendant's negligence and has consistently sought a jury trial. Although the plaintiff's counsel mistakenly believed that a demand for a jury trial was timely completed, the plaintiff has now paid the jury fee and served the Notice of Posting Jury Fees. The judge finds that the plaintiff has fulfilled the technical and core objective of the statute and that granting the motion would not cause any prejudice to the defendant. The judge has discretion to allow a trial by jury despite the potential waiver, and policy favors the court using its discretion to proceed with a jury trial. Therefore, the plaintiff's motion is granted, and the court will proceed with a jury trial.
