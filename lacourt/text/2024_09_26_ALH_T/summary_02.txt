```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's complaint lacked factual allegations regarding how the elevator caused the plaintiff's injury and failed to allege facts that would establish the defendant's culpability. The plaintiff argued that the complaint alleged sufficient facts to put the defendant on notice of the issues and did not negate the defendant's control over the elevator. The judge found that the plaintiff's pleadings were sufficient to make out a cognizable negligence action and denied the defendant's motion.
