And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Robert Gordon's motion for judgment on the pleadings, which means that the lawsuit filed by American Voice Mail, Inc. against Robert Gordon will be dismissed. The judge ruled that a corporation cannot directly sue a 50% shareholder in a company, and that any claims by the corporation against the shareholder must be brought through a shareholders' derivative suit. The judge also found that Robert Gordon had met the meet and confer requirement before filing his motion, which means that he had attempted to resolve the dispute with American Voice Mail, Inc. without filing a lawsuit.
