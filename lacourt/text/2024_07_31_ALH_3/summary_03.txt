Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer and motion to strike filed by Pasadena Hospital Association, Ltd. (Defendant) against Bernadette Galindo, Amalia Galindo, and Arthur Galindo (Plaintiffs).

The Plaintiffs alleged that the Defendant's treatment of Arthur Galindo, a dependent adult, constituted elder abuse and neglect. The Defendant demurred to the second and third causes of action, arguing that the Plaintiffs had not alleged facts that rise to the level of conduct entitled to heightened remedies under the Elder Abuse and Dependent Adult Civil Protection Act (EADACPA).

The judge found that the Plaintiffs' allegations still only amount to a claim for professional negligence, and not elder abuse or neglect. Therefore, the Defendant's demurrer to the second and third causes of action is sustained.

The judge also granted the Defendant's motion to strike the Plaintiffs' prayer for punitive damages, as punitive damages cannot be alleged against a medical provider without leave of court.

The judge noted that the Plaintiffs' allegations may not be sufficient to support their claims, and that the decision to use restraints instead of providing alternative solutions does not demonstrate a "failure to provide medical care".

The parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit, and the judge will consider the matter further at the hearing on July 31, 2024.
