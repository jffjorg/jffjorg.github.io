And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to resolve Medi-Cal liens without prejudice. The plaintiff, Mario Garcia, a Medi-Cal beneficiary, filed the motion on June 3, 2024, seeking to resolve his medical liens based on hardship. However, the Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) responded on July 18, 2024, arguing that it was premature because other claims against co-defendants remain pending in this action and no full settlement has been reached. The DHCS claims that it has not been able to perfect its lien because there has not been a total settlement or resolution of claims, and therefore it is unable to determine its final lien amount. The court agrees with the DHCS's argument and denies the plaintiff's motion.
