And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to strike or tax costs brought by the plaintiff, Rosevianney C. Ogumsi. The plaintiff seeks to strike or tax various costs claimed by the defendants, Richard Dale Gentile, D.D.S. et al.

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to strike or tax costs in part, finding that the defendants failed to provide sufficient documentation to support certain costs, including deposition costs, expert witness fees, court reporter fees, and transcript fees. The judge also finds that the defendants' costs for models, enlargements, and photocopies of exhibits were not reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation.

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion to strike or tax costs in part, finding that the defendants' costs for filing and motion fees, service of process costs, and fees for electronic filing or service were reasonable and necessary.

The total amount taxed from the defendants' memorandum of costs is $17,938.07, leaving a remaining total of $5,136.85 in recoverable costs. The parties have the opportunity to submit on this tentative ruling and indicate whether they will appear at the hearing.
