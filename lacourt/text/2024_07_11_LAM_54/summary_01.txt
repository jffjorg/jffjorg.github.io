And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court is considering a motion by the defendant, American Honda Motor Co., Inc., to bifurcate the trial into two phases. The first phase would focus on liability and compensatory damages, and the second phase would focus on punitive damages. The defendant is seeking to exclude any evidence of its profits or financial condition during the first phase of the trial, as well as any arguments or comments that may be made about the defendant's wealth or financial condition.

The Court is granting the motion in part, bifurcating the trial as requested. The jury will determine entitlement to punitive damages in Phase 1, and evidence of the defendant's profits and financial condition will not be admitted during that phase. The Court will address any other requests to exclude evidence made in a motion in limine.

The parties are advised to submit on the tentative ruling by emailing the courtroom before 8:30 am on the day of the hearing.
