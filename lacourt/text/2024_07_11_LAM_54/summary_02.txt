And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Maurice Leiter, has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion of Counsel Jilbert Tahmazian to be relieved as counsel for Craftscape Creations, LLC. The motion was unopposed, and the court considered the moving papers. The defendants jointly answered the lawsuit filed by Philopater Rizkalla on October 24, 2023, and Counsel Tahmazian has been representing them since then. However, the client has stopped paying fees, which is a hardship on the firm. The court finds that there will be no prejudice to any party, and the motion is granted. Counsel is required to give notice of the ruling.
