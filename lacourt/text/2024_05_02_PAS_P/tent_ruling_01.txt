In this lemon law case,
Vikas Kathepalli (Kathepalli) sued American Honda Motor Co. Inc. (Honda) for
defects with the 2020 Honda Accord she purchased. 
Before the Court is Plaintiff’s motion to compel Honda
to produce a Person Most Qualified for deposition. The motion was filed February
27, 2024. Honda filed an opposition on April 19, 2024. Plaintiff filed a reply
on April 25, 2024. 
          The
motion to compel deposition of Honda’s PMQ is GRANTED. 
II.      LEGAL STANDARD
 “If the
deponent named is not a natural person, the deposition notice shall describe
with reasonable particularity the matters on which examination is requested. In
that event, the deponent shall designate and produce at the deposition those of
its officers, directors, managing agents, employees, or agents who are most
qualified to testify on its behalf as to those matters to the extent of any
information known or reasonably available to the deponent. (CCP § 2025.230.)
Code
Civ. Proc. Section 2025.450 
(a)
If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an
officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person
designated by an organization that is a party under Section 2025.230, without
having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice. 
(b)
A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with both of the following: 
(1)
The motion shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the
production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice. 
(2)
The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under
Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and
produce the documents, electronically stored information, or things described
in the deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has
contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance. 
(g)(1)
If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted, the court shall impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the
party who noticed the deposition and against the deponent or the party with
whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust. III.
    ANALYSIS
          A. Meet and Confer Efforts Were Sufficient
          Plaintiff offers the declaration of her
attorney, Timothy Lupinek, in support of meet and confer efforts. (Lupinek
Declaration.) Lupinek declares that he first sent a meet and confer letter on December
29, 2023, as to Honda’s served objections to the deposition notice. (Lupinek
Decl. ¶ 7, Exh. D.) He declares that he logged into the deposition on January
4, 2024, but Honda nor its PMQ appeared. (Lupinek Decl. ¶ 8.) He declares he
sent follow-up emails on January 8, January 10, January 12, January  19, February 12, and February 23. (Lupinek
Decl. ¶ 9.) Honda responded by email indicating it would provide dates for its PMQ
deposition soon. (Lupinek Decl. ¶ 9.)
The Court finds that meet and confer efforts were
sufficient. 
B.
Motion
Plaintiff first served a notice of deposition on December
18, 2023, as to a January 4, 2024, deposition date. (Lupinek Decl. ¶ 3, see
Exh. A.) The deposition notice seeks testimony from the person most qualified
about why Honda did not purchase the vehicle back from Plaintiff prior to this
lawsuit being filed, the nature and extent of the vehicle’s repair history, and
other similar topics. On December 22, 2023, Defendant Honda served objections
to the deposition notice. (Lupinek Decl. ¶ 5, see Exh. C.) 
Code
Civ. Proc. Section 2017.010 permits a party to “obtain discovery regarding any
matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter . . . if the
matter is either itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated
to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (CCP § 2017.010.) 
Plaintiff urges that the information sought in the PMQ
deposition is relevant to her lemon law claims. (Motion, p. 11.) Plaintiff cites
CACI 3201 for the elements of a lemon law claim; namely, that plaintiff had a
defective new car, presented it for repairs, repairs were inadequate and
defendant refused to replace or buy back the car. (CACI 3201.) Information as to Honda’s analysis of
whether Plaintiff’s car should be bought back, the repair history of the car, Honda’s
lemon law policies and procedures and Honda’s staff training regarding lemon
law is relevant to Plaintiff’s claim, as they relate to the elements of a prima
facie case under lemon law. Plaintiff also cites several lemon law cases as to
the relevance of the car manufacturer’s policies, prior vehicle repairs and the
manufacturer’s criteria for determining if a car is a lemon. (See e.g., Krotin
v. Porsche Cars North America, Inc. (1995) 38 Cal. App.4th 294, 302; Kwan
v. Mercedes-Benz of North America (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 174, 186; Oregel
v. American Isuzu Motors Inc. (1995) 90 Cal.App.4th 1094; Jensen
v. BMW of North America, Inc. (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 112, 136.)
To the extent that Honda is still objecting based on
privacy, proprietary information or trade secret, the Court notes that parties
have entered a protective order. (5/3/23 Protective Order.) This objection is
overruled.
To the extent that Honda is still objecting to the PMQ
deposition on basis of attorney-client privilege, work product privilege,
vagueness or ambiguity, these objections are not supported. (Obregon v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424, 431; West Pico
Furniture Co. of L.A. (1961) 56 Cal.2d 407, 417.)
In its opposition, Honda urges that the only issue
remaining is when the deposition will occur. Honda is not pursuing its
substantive objections any longer.  
The motion to compel the PMQ deposition is granted.
The Court concludes that Honda failed to produce its PMQ without serving any
valid objection to the deposition notice.[1]
C.
Sanctions
Plaintiff seeks sanctions of $2,940.00 against
Honda for necessitating this motion. Plaintiff’s counsel, Timothy Lupinek,
indicates that he spent 3.4 hours preparing the motion and anticipates spending
2 hours answering opposition and 1 hour preparing for the hearing. He also
spent $60.00 on the filing fee. His hourly rate is $450. (Lupinek Decl. ¶ 10.)
The Court finds that sanctions are not warranted, as
the imposition of sanctions would be unjust. Honda provides an explanation of
the deposition delay. Honda’s counsel declares that Plaintiff’s counsel filed
more than 170 cases against Honda in 2022, that Plaintiff’s counsel has filed
120 cases against it in 2023 and is seeking PMQ depositions in several of the
cases. (See Hancox Decl. ¶¶ 9, 13.) Honda urges that it has offered several
dates for PMQ depositions, which it asserts Plaintiff’s counsel opted to use in
other cases. (See Hancox Decl. ¶ 13.)IV.
    CONCLUSION AND ORDER
          The motion by Plaintiff Kathepalli for
an order compelling the deposition of Honda’s person most qualified is granted.
Defendant’s PMQ is ordered to appear for deposition within 30 days.
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is denied. 
Counsel for Plaintiff is ordered to provide notice
of this ruling.
