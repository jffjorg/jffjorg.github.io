Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses two motions: one to compel production of text messages and another to consolidate cases. The plaintiff seeks to compel production of text messages between Kera Blades Snell and Michael Pellico, but Snell refused to produce the messages. The judge grants the motion to compel production of text messages. The plaintiff also seeks to consolidate cases and bifurcate trial, but the judge denies the motion to consolidate because the cases are not related into a single department.
