```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is continuing the hearing on the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay the action, pending further briefing from the parties. The court has tentatively ruled that the defendant's "arbitration" agreement is not enforceable because it requires "non-binding" arbitration, which is not a binding decision. The court also notes that there is no legal authority authorizing a court to order a case to non-binding arbitration in a motion to compel arbitration. The court is continuing the hearing to allow the parties to address this new issue and to provide proper notice and opportunity to be heard.
