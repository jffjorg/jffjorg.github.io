And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint is overruled as to the first cause of action for fraud and deceit, but sustained without leave to amend as to the second cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The judge has also denied the defendant's motion to strike the request for punitive damages and the allegations regarding online reviews.

The judge found that the defendant's argument that the Retail Installment Sales Contract is invalid due to fraud is unpersuasive, as the plaintiff's complaint does not allege that the contract is valid and enforceable. The judge also found that the defendant's demurrer to the first cause of action is unpersuasive because it merely references the pleading requirements of specificity and particularity, but does not present a specific argument on how the pleading is deficient.

The judge has ordered the defendant to file an answer to the complaint within 20 days.
