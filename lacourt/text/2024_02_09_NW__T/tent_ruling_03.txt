ROSALINE L. ... vs VLADISLAV SHULIKO 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER:  Judgment Debtor Vladislav Shuliko’s Claim of
Exemption is GRANTED in Part and DENIED in Part.  The Levying Officer is ORDERED to release
$1,500.00 to the Judgment Creditor Julia Gandelsman and to release the balance
of $185.08 to the Judgment Debtor Vladislav Shuliko.
Introduction 
Defendant/Judgment Debtor
Vladislav Shuliko (Debtor) filed a claim of exemption as to a bank levy issued
in favor of Plaintiff/Judgment Creditor Julia Gandelsman (Creditor).  
Discussion  
Per the Writ of Execution filed
on October 19, 2023, the Los Angeles County Sheriff levied funds found in
Debtor’s bank account in the amount of $1,685.08.  Funds in a natural person's deposit account
may be exempt, and the judgment debtor may file a claim of exemption to release
the funds from the execution levy. Funds in a judgment debtor’s deposit account
are exempt to the extent necessary for the support of the judgment debtor.  (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 704.225.)  Debtor filed a Financial Statement asserting
that the levied funds are exempt because they are necessary for his
support.  Debtor’s Financial Statement
asserts that he has “no income” yet incurs monthly expenses totaling
$23,750.00.  Although the breakdown of
expenses appears to be excessive because Debtor is single and has no spouse or
dependents, the Court noted that Debtor spends $1,500.00 per month for
“Entertainment”.   The Court does not
find that the “Entertainment” expense is necessary for the Debtor’s support and
the amount can be applied to payment of the judgment.
Debtor’s Claim of Exemption is
GRANTED in Part and DENIED in Part.  The
levying officer is ordered to release $1,500.00 to Creditor and the balance of
$185.08 to Debtor.   
IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE
NOTICE.
