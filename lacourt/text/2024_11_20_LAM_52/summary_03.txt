And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Gallery Department LLC's motion to seal part of attorney Gary Adelman's pro hac vice application. The motion is to seal the portion of the application that contains Adelman's residence address. The judge finds that Adelman has a significant interest in maintaining the privacy of his home address, as individuals have a substantial interest in the privacy of their home. The judge also finds that the interest in public access to Adelman's home address is minimal, as it is not related to the merits of the action and Adelman only needs to state his address because he is not a member of the State Bar of California. The judge grants the motion and orders the sealing of the unredacted version of Adelman's application to appear pro hac vice.
