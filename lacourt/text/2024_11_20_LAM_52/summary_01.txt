And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The City of Baldwin Park has filed a motion to request that the court retain jurisdiction to enforce a settlement agreement. However, the court has no jurisdiction to do so because the case was dismissed with prejudice over two years ago. The court has no power to retain jurisdiction after a case is dismissed. The defendant's motion is too late and fails to comply with the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. The court has denied the defendant's motion.
