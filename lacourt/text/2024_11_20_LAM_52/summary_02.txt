And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, American Honda Motor Co., Inc., has moved to exclude evidence of the plaintiff's repair visits after the lawsuit was filed. The defendant argues that these visits are not relevant to the case, citing Valdovinos v. Kia Motors America, Inc. (2024) 104 Cal.App.5th 732, which holds that repair visits after the lawsuit was filed are not actionable or relevant to a Song-Beverly claim. The court finds that the defendant's argument is not supported by the Valdovinos case, and that evidence of repair visits after the lawsuit was filed may be relevant to prove that the vehicle was defective during the warranty period. However, the court also finds that the six repair visits from 2022 to 2024 are not relevant to the current case, as they do not show that the vehicle was defective before the plaintiff filed the action. The court grants the defendant's motion and excludes evidence and argument regarding these six repair visits.
