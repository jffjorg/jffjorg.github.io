MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO FORM
INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE; REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS

Los Angeles Superior Court Case # 23CHCV03467

 
Motion
filed: 5/23/24
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendants Emil J. Simanian D.D.S.,
Inc. DBA Golden Oak Dental Group Practice of Emil J Simanian DDS Inc. (erroneously
sued as Golden Oak Dental Group, a California Corporation) (“GODGP” or the “Moving
Defendant”)
RESPONDING PARTY: None.
NOTICE: OK.
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED: An
order from this Court compelling Plaintiff Liliana Castillo Onofre (“Plaintiff”
or “Onofre”), to serve verified responses, without objection, to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, and imposing monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and
her attorney of record, in the amount of $2,610.00.
 
TENTATIVE
RULING: The
motion is GRANTED. The request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED IN PART.
 
BACKGROUND
 
On November 13, 2023, Plaintiff initiated this action.
Subsequently, on January 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed her operative First Amended
Complaint (“FAC”) against Defendants Emil J. Simanian and GODGP (collectively
“Defendants”), and Does 1 to 25, alleging (1) Medical Malpractice, (2) General
Negligence, and (3) Negligence Hiring, Training, and Supervision. Subsequently,
Defendants filed their Answer to the Complaint on February 29, 2024.
 
On May 23, 2024, Defendant GODGP filed the instant Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s
Responses to its Form Interrogatories, Set One (the “Motion”). Additionally, GODGP
requests monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and her counsel.  
 
No Opposition or Reply papers have been received by the
Court.
 
ANALYSIS
 
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to
serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
responses and for a monetary sanction.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (b).)  The statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel
where no responses have been served. All that needs to be shown in the
moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the
opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of
any kind has been served.  (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111
Cal.App.3d 902, 905-906.) 
 
A.   
Motion to
Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One
 
The Moving Defendant’s counsel attests that on February 29,
2024, it served Plaintiff with the first set of Form Interrogatories, to which
responses were due on April 1, 2024. (Conley Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. “A.”) Having not
received any responses by the due date, GODGP sent Plaintiff’s counsel a
written meet and confer letter on April 30, 2024, demanding Plaintiff to serve
responses, without objection, by May 6, 2024. (Id. ¶ 4, Ex. “B.”) Subsequently,
on May 2, 2024, in response to Plaintiff’s request for an extension of two
weeks, GODGP agreed to grant a one-week extension. (Id. ¶ 6.) However,
no responses had been received by GODGP as of May 21, 2024. (Id. ¶ 7.)  
 
Given the absence of any Opposition from Plaintiff and the
records above, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to serve a timely
response, thereby waiving any objection to the interrogatories, including those
based on privilege or the protection for work product, pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (a).  
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS the Motion to Compel Responses
to Form Interrogatories, Set One.
 
B.    
Monetary
Sanctions
Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (c), “[t]he Court shall impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust....” Additionally, California Rules
of Court rule 3.1348(A) further provides, “The Court may award sanctions under
the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery,
even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion
was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party
after the motion was filed.”
Here, Plaintiff did not
provide responses to the Form Interrogatories nor file an Opposition to the
Motion. Accordingly, based on the above records and authorities, the Court
finds that it is appropriate to impose monetary sanctions. The Court determines
the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the
work performed in connection with the Motion to be $697.50, calculated based on
a reasonable hourly rate of $425 for 1.5 hours reasonably spent, in addition to
a $60.00 filing fee.
Therefore, the Court GRANTS IN PART Plaintiff’s request for
monetary sanctions.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, is GRANTED.
 
Plaintiff
is ordered to serve verified responses, without objection, to Defendant’s
Form Interrogatories, Set One, within 20 days.
 
Defendant Emil J. Simanian D.D.S.,
Inc.’s request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED IN PART.
 
Plaintiff Liliana
Castillo Onofre and her attorney of record are ordered to jointly and severally
pay $697.50 to Defendant Emil J. Simanian
D.D.S., Inc. within
20 days.
 
Moving party to give notice.
