  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion to compel further
  responses to form interrogatories – general 
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Emilio Reyes 
 
RESPONDING PARTIES:    Defendants Los Indios de San Gabriel, Inc.,
and Andrew Salas
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories – General 
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Emilio Reyes (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order (1)
compelling defendant Andrew Salas (“Defendant”) to serve further responses,
without objections, to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories – General, Set One,
number 2.5, and (2) awarding monetary sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and
against Defendant in the amount of $109.34.
The court finds that the discovery motion cutoff date has passed and
therefore denies Plaintiff’s motion. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (a).) 
Except as otherwise provided, “any party shall be entitled as a matter
of right to complete discovery proceedings on or before the 30th day, and to
have motions concerning discovery heard on or before the 15th day, before the
date initially set for the trial of the action.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (a).)  “Thus, if a party properly notices a
discovery motion to be heard on or before the discovery motion cutoff date,
that party has a right to have the motion heard.  By negative implication, a party who notices
a discovery motion to be heard after the discovery motion cutoff date
does not have a right to have the motion heard.”  (Pelton-Shepherd Industries, Inc. v. Delta
Packaging Products, Inc. (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1568, 1586 [emphasis in
original].)
On March 6, 2023, the court issued a minute order setting this case
for trial on May 15, 2024.  (Mar. 6, 2023
Minute Order, p. 1.)  Thereafter, on May
2, 2024, the court issued a minute order (1) continuing trial from May 15, 2024
to July 10, 2024, and (2) stating that “[a]ll discovery cut-off and discovery
motion cut-off dates, and deadlines for the exchange of information concerning
expert trial witnesses, shall be based on the date initially set for trial of
this action (5/15/24) and shall not be reopened or based on the new trial date,
except that Defendants may take the deposition of Plaintiff Emilio Reyes
pursuant to the Court’s 5/1/24 order.” 
(May 2, 2024 Minute Order, pp. 1-2.) 

Thus, the court finds that the discovery motion cutoff date in this
action was April 30, 2024, i.e., the 15th day before the May 15, 2024 trial
date.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020,
subd. (a); May 2, 2024 Minute Order, pp. 1-2.)  However, Plaintiff (1) noticed this motion for
hearing on June 27, 2024 (i.e., following the discovery motion cutoff date),
and (2) did not (i) request that the court extend the discovery motion cutoff date
pursuant to section 2024.050, or (ii) show that the considerations set forth in
that statute support extending the discovery motion cutoff date.  (Notice of Mot., pp. 1:26-2:2.)  The court therefore finds that, because
Plaintiff noticed this motion to be heard after the discovery motion cutoff
date passed, Plaintiff does not have a right to have this motion heard.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (a); Pelton-Shepherd
Industries, Inc., supra, 165 Cal.App.4th at p. 1586.)
            The court finds that the
circumstances presented would make the imposition of sanctions unjust and
therefore denies Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions against Plaintiff.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (d).) 
ORDER
            The court denies plaintiff Emilio Reyes’s
motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories.
            The court orders defendant Andrew
Salas to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
