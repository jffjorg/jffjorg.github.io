Judge Robert B. Broadbelt III has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Plaintiff Emilio Reyes to compel further responses to form interrogatories. The motion was noticed for hearing on June 27, 2024, after the discovery motion cutoff date of April 30, 2024. The court finds that Plaintiff does not have a right to have the motion heard because it was noticed after the cutoff date, and therefore denies the motion. The court also denies Defendant Andrew Salas' request for monetary sanctions against Plaintiff in the amount of $109.34. The court orders Defendant Salas to give notice of this ruling.
