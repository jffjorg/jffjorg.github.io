And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The Court has denied Defendant Marder's motion for reconsideration of the Court's April 2, 2024, order denying his motion to stay action and post bond. The Court has granted the alternative relief requested, which is to reconsider the Court's April 2, 2024, order, and has again denied Defendant Marder's motion to stay action and post bond.

The Court's decision is based on the allegations in the Complaint regarding futility in demand, specifically through evidence that the only other managing member in Capo LLC has not been involved with business operations for more than four years, thus showing de facto control of Capo LLC by Defendant Marder. The Court has also noted that there appears to be a "reasonable possibility that the prosecution of the cause of action alleged in the complaint against the moving party will benefit the limited liability company" Capo LLC.
