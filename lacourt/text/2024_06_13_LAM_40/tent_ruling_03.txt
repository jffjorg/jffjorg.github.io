I. Background
A. Pleadings
Plaintiffs Antonio Becerra and Guadalupe Becerra (the Becerras) sue
Defendants Defendant Roger Anderson, Trustee of the RWA Trust Dated March 14,
2014 (Roger Anderson, Trustee), FCI Lender Services Inc. (FCI), California TD
Specialists (Cal TD), and Does 1-20 pursuant to a December 1, 2023, Complaint.
The Complaint alleges claims of (1) Violation of California Constitution
Article XV, Section 1 and California Civil Code section 1916-3, (2) Violations
of Welfare & Institutions Code §15600 et seq. (Elder Abuse), (3) Breach of
Contract, (4) Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, (5)
Unfair Business Practices, (6) Slander of Title, (7) Fraud, and (8) Negligent
Misrepresentation.
The claims arise from the following allegations. The Becerras—aged 83 and
84 years old at the time the Complaint was filed—are the sole owners of 1008
Adelante Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90042 (the Property). On or around November
25, 2019, the Becerras obtained a loan from Roger Anderson, Trustee, in the
amount of $430,000, secured by a deed of trust and promissory note, which
contained an interest note rate of 12% per annum, as well as a default rate to
be the lower of a 24% per annum interest rate or the maximum interest permitted
by law. FCI was appointed as the servicer on the loan, Cal TD was appointed as
the non-judicial foreclosure trustee, and Olympia Financial Group brokered the
loan transaction. On December 31, 2021, the Becerras executed a loan and deed
of trust modification to receive $73,823.46 in additional funds, a modification
arranged solely by Roger Anderson, Trustee, as lender, despite the lack of real
estate broker license. The modified loan was subject to the same interest
rates. Due to nonpayment of $19,950, on May 1, 2023, a notice of default was
issued on the Property. A notice of trustee’s sale was issued on August 4,
2023, with the sale date ultimately moved to December 6, 2023. FCI issued a
payoff demand on the loan on or about September 15, 2023, citing the interest
rate in the original and modified loan documents: 12%. In response, the
Becerras filed for bankruptcy on August 29, 2023. An automatic stay was placed
on the non-judicial foreclosure, which was lifted on November 30, 2023, with
the non-judicial foreclosure sale set for December 6, 2023.
The Becerras’ Complaint alleges that the loan modification arranged
solely by Roger Anderson, Trustee—a person not licensed to act as a real estate
broker in California—involves note and default rates that are usurious and
unconstitutional, i.e., rates should have been limited to 10%, with no
applicable exemptions based on Anderson’s lack of a real estate broker license.
The Complaint alleges that Anderson and/or other Defendants engaged in elder
abuse, breach of contract, fraud, and other injuries to the Becerras through
the events surrounding, representations relating to, and terms of the loan
modification. For example, these actions include Anderson issuing foreclosure
notices and a notice of trustee’s sale, which were premised on usurious
interest rates of 12% for the note between February and April 2023 and a 24%
default interest rate as of May 2023, based on the Becerras’ default, and FCI
issuing a payoff demand letter based on those same rates, which exceed the 10%
maximum constitutionally allowed in California, as applicable to the loan
following its modification in December 2021. Cal TD is alleged to have
facilitated this unlawful foreclosure by recording the documents facilitating
the foreclosure.
The Complaint specifically notes that the initial loan transaction was
lawful because that transaction and its interest rates were brokered by Olympia
Financial Group, thus qualifying under a “broker arranged” exemption to
California’s usury laws. The Complaint consequently sues based only on the
transactions between the parties that followed the Becerras’ loan modification
with Roger Anderson, Trustee, in December 2021, which involves a 12% interest
note rate and 24% interest default rate.
The Becerras pray for the enjoining of the foreclosure sale, damages,
costs and fees, a declaration of the interest owed on the Property, and other
relief as the Court may deem just and proper. The Complaint also cites to case
law purporting to hold that where a lender offers a loan exceeding the maximum
amount permitted by the State’s Constitution, the lender is only entitled to
receive the principal, with no recoverable interest, and the borrower may
recover treble damages for the usurious rate, attorney’s fees, and, if proper,
loan forbearance.
B. Motion Before the
Court
On March 22, 2024,
Roger Anderson, Trustee, FCI, and Cal TD filed a demurrer challenging the
Complaint’s eight causes of action. Portions of the arguments heavily rely on
requests for judicial notice.
That same day, Roger
Anderson, Trustee, FCI, and Cal TD filed a motion to strike punitive damages
from the Complaint, as well as purportedly conclusory and scandalous language
in the Complaint.
On May 31, 2024, the
Becerras filed separate oppositions to the demurrer and motion to strike. The
Becerras also filed a joint request for judicial notice in relation to their
oppositions.
On June 6, 2024, Roger
Anderson, Trustee, FCI, and Cal TD filed replies against Plaintiff’s oppositions.
The demurrer reply attaches a declaration from counsel.
On June 10, 2024, the
Becerras filed objections to the demurrer reply and to the declaration from
counsel attached to the reply.
Roger Anderson,
Trustee, FCI, and Cal TD’s demurrer and motion to strike are now before the
Court.
 
II. Demurrer
A.
Requests for Judicial Notice
1. Demurrer and Motion to Strike
The
Court DENIES judicial notice of the fourteen matters advanced for notice by
Roger Anderson, Trustee, FCI, and Cal TD.
By
submitting such an extensive evidentiary record and mixing conclusions to be
drawn from that record in relation to the sufficiency of at least five of eight
claims alleged in the Becerras’ Complaint, Roger Anderson, Trustee, FCI, and
Cal TD’s request in effect would create an evidentiary hearing where the
hearing is supposed to be limited to the sufficiency of the pleadings.
(Demurrer, 17:12-16, 20:5-11 [usury], 21:4-14 [slander of title], 22:16-18
[breach of contract claims], 23:18-20 [unfair competition claim].)
On
a demurrer—i.e., a challenge to pleadings, as with a motion to strike—a court’s
function is limited to testing the legal sufficiency of the complaint. (Marina
Tenants Assn. v. Deauville Marina Development Co. (1986) 181 Cal.App.3d
122, 127.) A demurrer is simply not the appropriate procedure for determining
the truth of disputed facts. (Ramsden v. Western Union (1977) 71
Cal.App.3d 873, 879; Intengan v. BAC Home Loans Servicing LP (2013) 214
Cal.App.4th 1047, 1058.) The hearing on demurrer may not be turned into a
contested evidentiary hearing through the guise of having the court take
judicial notice of documents whose truthfulness or proper interpretation are
disputable. (Joslin v. H.A.S. Ins. Brokerage (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 369,
375; see also Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123
Cal.App.3d 593, 604-605 (Del E. Webb) [The hearing on demurrer may not
be turned into a contested evidentiary hearing through the guise of having the
court take judicial notice of affidavits, declarations, depositions, and other
such material that was filed on behalf of the adverse party and purports to
contradict the allegations and contentions of the plaintiff].) Judicial notice
of matters upon demurrer will be dispositive only in those instances where
there is not or cannot be a factual dispute concerning that which is sought to
be judicially noticed. (Cruz v. County of Los Angeles (1985) 173
Cal.App.3d 1131, 1134.)
Here,
the interpretation of the effect of the matters for which judicial notice is
sought is disputed by the parties. (See, e.g., Opp’n to Demurrer, p. 9 [“To
begin with, the paragraphs 18-21, 29, and 30 of the Complaint, paragraphs 6-7
of Arthur Becerra’s Supplemental Declaration, and paragraph 9 of Antonio Becerra’s
Supplemental Declaration, they do not state Mr. Becerra negotiated with FCI”].)
Under
these circumstances, the Court determines that the more appropriate vehicle for
the mixed challenge to the Complaint’s claims is, for example, a motion for
summary judgment or adjudication or other motion in connection to which
evidence can be filed to dispositively challenge the claims alleged in the pleadings.
Last,
the Court notes that this determination is one to which the Court is entitled
discretion. (Del E. Webb, supra, 123 Cal.App.3d at p. 605 [trial could
properly take judicial notice of judicial admissions].)
2. Oppositions to Demurrer and Motion to
Strike
The
Court DENIES judicial notice of the documents advanced for notice by the
Becerras. The Court adopts the same reasoning as above and limits this order to
an analysis of the pleadings.
B.
Evidentiary Objections
1. Becerra Plaintiffs’ Post-Reply
Objection to Fink Declaration Attached to Reply
The
Court SUSTAINS the Becerras’ objection to the Fink declaration, which seeks to
introduce two further matters for consideration in relation to the Court’s
analysis of Roger Anderson, Trustee, FCI, and Cal TD’s demurrer, i.e.,
discovery responses from the Becerras—a sort of informal judicial notice
request. (Demurrer Reply, pp. 2-3.)
The
Court relies on the reasoning in the Judicial Notice discussion above in
limiting this order to an analysis of the pleadings.
2. Becerra Plaintiffs’ Post-Reply
Objection to Reply
The
Court SUSTAINS the Becerras’ objection to the reply’s reliance on the documents
advanced in the Fink declaration attached to Roger Anderson, Trustee, FCI, and
Cal TD’s reply.
The
Court relies on the reasoning in the Judicial Notice discussion above in
limiting this order to an analysis of the pleadings.
C.
Legal Standard
A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.
(Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747; see Code Civ. Proc., §
430.10, subd. (e).)
To
sufficiently allege a cause of action, a complaint must allege all the ultimate
facts—that is, the facts needed to establish each element of the cause of
action pleaded. (Committee on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods
Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 212, superseded by statute as stated in Branick
v. Downey Savings & Loan Assn. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 235, 242.) “[E]ach
evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need
not be alleged.” (C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012)
53 Cal.4th 861, 872.)
In
testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth
of all material facts properly pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist.
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-67.) Courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006)
144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228, disapproved on other grounds, Jones v. Lodge at
Torrey Pines Partnership (2008) 42 Cal.4th 1158, 1162.) A demurrer,
however, “does not admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.”
(Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.) 
D.
Analysis
Here,
because the Court has declined to take judicial notice or consider any of the
extrinsic evidence attached to the papers before the Court, the analyses of the
demurrer will be limited to the pleadings and arguments raised in the papers
related to those allegations, without the benefit of extrinsic evidence.
The
Court also notes that to extent that it makes findings, these findings are
limited to an analysis of the pleadings for the purposes of the two motions
before the Court, not as a final dispositive ruling on issues to be tried.
1. Demurrer, Complaint, First
Cause of Action, Violation of California Constitution Article XV, Section One
and California Civil Code section 1916-3 [Usury]: OVERRULED.
a. Relevant
Law
The California Constitution prohibits
any “person, association, copartnership or corporation … [from] charging any
fee, bonus, commission, discount or other compensation receive from a borrower
more than the interest authorized by this section upon any loan or forbearance
of any money, goods or things in action”—i.e., a prohibition on what is
commonly referred to as usury. (Cal. Const., art. XV, § 1.)
“The essential elements of usury
are: (1) The transaction must be a loan or forbearance; (2) the interest to be
paid must exceed the statutory maximum; (3) the loan and interest must be
absolutely repayable by the borrower; and (4) the lender must have a willful
intent to enter into a usurious transaction. [Citations.]” (Ghirardo v.
Antonioli (1994) 8 Cal.4th 791, 798 (Ghirardo).)
Various exemptions exist to California’s usury laws, including where any
loans are made or arranged by any person licensed as a real estate broker by
the State of California and secured in whole or in part by liens on real
property. (Cal. Const., art. XV, § 1.) Where no exemptions exist, interest rates on consumer loans are limited to
10% per annum and interest rates on non-consumer loans are limited to the
maximum of 10% per annum or the applicable “federal discount rate” plus 5%,
whichever is greater. (Cal. Const., art. XV, § 1, subd (2).)
b. Court’s
Determination
The Court finds in favor of the
Becerras.
The Court notes that this claim is
only alleged against Roger Anderson, Trustee.
i. The Alleged
Transaction is a Forbearance
For ease of discussion in
distinguishing authority in later sections, the Court discusses why the
modification alleged in the Complaint is a forbearance as opposed to a loan or
a bona fide credit sale.
“A loan of money is the delivery of
a sum of money to another under a contract to return at some future time an
equivalent amount. A forbearance of money is the giving of further time for the
payment of a debt or an agreement not to enforce a claim at its due date. (Boerner
v. Colwell Co. (1978) 21 Cal.3d 37, 44, fn. 7 … [(Boerner)].)” (Southwest
Concrete Products v. Gosh Construction Corp. (1990) 51 Cal.3d 701, 705 (Southwest
Concrete).)
“In determining whether a
transaction constitutes a loan or forbearance, we look to the substance rather
than the form of the transaction. ‘In all such cases the issue is whether or
not the bargain of the parties, assessed in light of all the circumstances and
with a view to substance rather than form, has as its true object the hire of
money at an excessive rate of interest.’ (Boerner v. Colwell Co., supra,
21 Cal.3d at p. 44.)” (Southwest Concrete, supra, 51 Cal.3d at p.
705.)
“However, ‘[b]oth a loan of money
and a forbearance are to be distinguished from a sale which is the “transfer of
property in a thing for a price in money[,]”‘ [i.e., a bona fide credit sale.]
(O’Connor v. Televideo System, Inc. (1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 709, 713 ….)”
(Southwest Concrete, supra, 51 Cal.3d at p. 705; see Boerner,
supra, at p. 47 [“‘A sale is the transfer of the property in a thing for
a price in money” and “[t]he transfer of the property in the thing sold for a
price is the essence of the transaction,” whereas “[a] loan … is the delivery
of a sum of money to another under a contract to return at some future time an
equivalent amount with or without an additional sum agreed upon for its use[,]
… regardless of its form”[;] [b]y the same token, however, ‘(c)ontractors are
free to buy and sell their property, and this may include promissory notes and
other instruments, at a price agreed upon, and when the bona fides of the
parties is established the percentage of profit has no relation to the usury
law[,]’” citations omitted].)
“… [C]ourts have distinguished
between a “loan” or “forbearance” of money and a bonafide credit sale (Boerner
v. Colwell Co. (1978) 21 Cal.3d 37, 43-51[] …; see also Verbeck v.
Clymer (1927) 202 Cal. 557[] …) since the latter is not subject to the
usury laws. The articulated rationale for subjecting loans and forbearances to
usury laws but not bona fide credit sales is that the owner of property ‘… may
offer to sell at a designated price for cash or at a much higher price on
credit, and a credit sale will not constitute usury however great the
difference between the two prices, unless the buying and selling was a mere
pretense; … it is not material that the agreement for the purchase price in the
future, instead of specifying the whole sum then to be paid, names a particular
sum as principal, and declares that it shall draw interest at a rate which,
were the transaction a borrowing and lending, would clearly be usurious ….” (Verbeck
v. Clymer, supra, at p. 563[] ….)” (DCM Partners v. Smith
(1991) 228 Cla.App.3d 729, 733.) (DMC).)
Here, the Complaint alleges that
the Becerras are the sole owners of the subject property (Complaint, ¶ 9), that
in November 2019 the Becerras secured a broker-assisted mortgage for the
property from the trust over which Roger Anderson is trustee, with the loan
setting out an interest rate of 12% and default rate of 24%  (Complaint, ¶¶ 13-16), and that a non-broker
assisted mortgage for the property was executed in December 2021, which set out
a usurious interest rate of 12% and default rate of 24% (Complaint, ¶¶ 17-21.)
The modification involved Roger Anderson “advanced[ing] additional funds of
$73,823.46, extend[ing] the maturity date of the Loan to January 1, 2024, increas[ing]
the principal loan balance to $503,478.83, and increas[ing] the ongoing monthly
interest-only payment amount was $5,033.78.” (Complaint, ¶ 17.)
Read liberally, the Complaint alleges
that the Becerras owned a home that was not purchased from Defendants (i.e.., not
a bona fide credit sale exempt from usury laws per Southwest Concrete), and
that the original loan for the property was issued in 2019, with the 2021
transaction acting as a forbearance with additional terms.
ii. Defendants’
Arguments Are Unavailing
The Court disregards the evidence
filed in connection with Defendants’ papers based on the Request for Judicial
Notice discussion above. (See, e.g., Demurrer, 20:5-11.)
The Court’s analysis instead
focuses on the substantive arguments for why the pleadings alone fail to allege
usury.
In its January 17, 2024, order, the
Court already noted that neither In re Moon (B.A.P. 9th Cir. 2023) 648
B.R. 73 (Moon) [currently on appeal] nor Strike v. Trans-West
Discount Corp. (1979) 92 Cal.App.3d 735 (Strike) are directly on
point in this action, where the demurrer relies on Strike and the
opposition relies on Moon. Strike is not directly on point for
the following reasons. That case involved the assignment of a promissory note
from a usury-law exempt bank to a non-exempt assignee and resolved whether the
assignee’s collection of interest pursuant to the note was usurious where the
interest rate being charged was in excess of the permissible interest rate imposed
by usury laws, holding that the subsequent event of assignment did not render
the 11% interest rate to be received by the assignee usurious. No modification
of the loan appears in Strike. (Strike, supra, at pp.
739-740, 745.) In contrast, here, as alleged, there was no assignment of the
loan and there was a modification of the loan terms. (Complaint, ¶¶ 17-21.) It
is not clear under these circumstances that the “subsequent event” considered
in Strike (assignment) is comparable to the “subsequent event” alleged
here (forbearance and other modifications).
As for DCM, supra, 228
Cal.App.3d at pp. 736-737, and Ghirardo, supra, 8 Cal.4th at pp.
805-806, as acknowledged by the demurrer, those cases involved credit sales,
not loan or forbearance transactions. (Demurrer, 19:21-22; see also Demurrer,
p. 17 [quoting Ghirardo].) While Defendants argue that the credit sale
nature of the facts in those cases was not the most important reason for the
holding in DCM (in the demurrer, the “raison d’etre”), DCM itself
explains at page 733 that loans and forbearances on one hand and bona fide
credit sales on the other are treated different in relation to usury laws.
Thus, contrary to the demurrer’s arguments, the Court finds that the bona fide
credit sale nature of DCM and Ghirardo was important for the
cited portions of those cases—cited in pages 17 and 19 of the demurrer—providing
a basis for determining that those cases do not apply to the allegations before
the Court.
The traditional rule that a default
interest rate is not usurious if triggered by default (Sharp v. Mortgage
Sec. Corp. (1932) 215 Cal. 287, 290-291; see Reply, p. 16 [citing this
rule]), would apply if the facts here were limited to a default under the 2019
transaction, where the triggering of the default would lead to a charge of and
foreclosure proceedings based on an otherwise usurious interest rate. However,
here there is alleged to be a 2021 loan modification that is effectively a
forbearance, which contains both usurious base and default rates.
The Court thus finds the demurrer
arguments against the first cause of action unavailing.
Roger Anderson, Trustee, FCI, and
Cal TD’s demurrer is thus OVERRULED as to the Complaint’s first cause of
action.
2. Demurrer,
Complaint, Second Cause of Action, Violations of Welfare & Institutions
Code §15600 et seq. (Elder Abuse): OVERRULED.
a. Relevant
Law
The California Welfare and
Institutions Code (the Elder Abuse Act) defines an “elder” as a person beyond
the age of 65 years. (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 15610.27.)
Financial abuse of an elder occurs
when a person or entity (1) takes, secretes, appropriates, obtains, or retains
real or personal property of an elder or dependent adult for a wrongful use or
with intent to defraud, or both, (2) assists in taking, secreting,
appropriating, obtaining, or retaining real or personal property of an elder or
dependent adult for a wrongful use or with intent to defraud, or both, or (3)
takes, secretes, appropriates, obtains, or retains, or assists in taking,
secreting, appropriating, obtaining, or retaining, real or personal property of
an elder or dependent adult by undue influence, as defined in Section 15610.70.
(Welf. & Inst. Code, §15610.30, subd. (a); see
CACI, § 3100 [To establish financial elder abuse, the plaintiff must allege
that the defendant took or retained the plaintiff’s property; that the
plaintiff was 65 years of age or older at the time of the conduct; that the
defendant took or retained the property for a wrongful use or with the intent
to defraud; that the plaintiff was harmed; and that the defendant’s conduct was
a substantial factor in cause the plaintiff’s harm].)
A person shall be deemed to have
taken property for a wrongful use if, among other things, the person takes the
property and the person knew or should have known that this conduct is likely
to be harmful to the elder. (Welf. & Inst. Code, §15610.30, subd. (b).)
A person is deemed to have taken
the property when he or she has deprived an elder of any property right. (Welf.
& Inst. Code, §15610.30, subd. (c).)
As a statutory claim, financial elder abuse must be pleaded
with particularity. (See Covenant Care, Inc. v. Superior Court (2004) 32
Cal.4th 771, 790.) 
b. Court’s
Determination
The Court finds in favor of the
Becerras.
Here, the second cause of action
for elder abuse is derivative of the allegations supporting the first cause of
action insofar as the elder abuse is alleged to have arisen from the allegedly
usurious loan transaction in 2021 leading the Becerras to the precipice of
losing their home and mental anguish. (See, e.g., Complaint, ¶¶ 46, 51-52.)
The Court notes that this claim is
only alleged against Roger Anderson, Trustee.
In their demurrer, Roger Anderson,
Trustee, FCI, and Cal TD challenge the claim on the grounds that (1) the
charging of the interest rate—12% interest base and 24% in case of default—is
not usurious, a conclusion with which the Court has disagreed at the pleadings
stage (see discussion above), and (2) the contractual interest rate was thus
permissible, as admitted by the Becerras in their Complaint at paragraphs 13,
14, 17, and 18.
Defendants also argue, without any
elaboration, that the Complaint is devoid of factual allegations satisfying the
elements of financial elder abuse, and cite to case law the proposition that
the enforcement of contractual rights to the detriment of an elder is not elder
abuse. (Demurrer pp. 20-21; see also Reply, p. 6.)
Next, the Court disagrees with the
specificity argument insofar as the Complaint alleges harm as a result of, for
example, being charged a usurious interest rate (Complaint, ¶¶ 17-21), that led
to default, foreclosure proceedings (Complaint, ¶ 22), as well as the
recordation of a notice of trustee sale and a payoff demand (recordation
disputed as to latter) (Complaint, ¶¶ 23, 24), as incorporated into the second
cause of action (Complaint, ¶ 46), which alleges damages (Complaint, ¶¶ 52, 53).

The Court last notes that it is
satisfied that a sufficient “right” for elder abuse purposes is at stake here
based on the personal Constitutional right to be free from usurious loan or
forbearance transactions. (Opp’n, pp. 10-11 [arguing in favor of sufficiency of
claim based on right to be free from usurious interest that has led to
attempted foreclosure]; Reply, p. 6 [rebuttal].)
Roger Anderson, Trustee, FCI, and
Cal TD’s demurrer is thus OVERRULED as to the Complaint’s second cause of
action.
3. Demurrer,
Complaint, Third and Fourth Causes of Action, Breach of Contract and Breach of
the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing: OVERRULED.
a. Relevant
Law
“A contract is a voluntary and
lawful agreement, by competent parties, for a good consideration, to do or not
to do a specified thing.” (Robinson v. Magee (1858) 9 Cal. 81, 83.) “To
prevail on a cause of action for breach of contract, the plaintiff must prove
(1) the contract, (2) the plaintiff’s performance of the contract or excuse for
nonperformance, (3) the defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damage to the
plaintiff.” (Richman v. Hartley (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1182, 1186.) Implicit in the element of damage is that the defendant’s
breach caused the plaintiff’s damage.” (Troyk v. Farmers Group, Inc.
(2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1305, 1352, italics omitted.)
To prevail on a cause of action for
breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, the plaintiff
must prove: (1) the existence of a contract between plaintiff and defendant;
(2) plaintiff performed his contractual obligations or was excused from
performing them; (3) the conditions requiring defendant’s performance had
occurred; (4) the defendant unfairly interfered with the plaintiff’s right to
receive the benefits of the contract; and (5) the plaintiff was harmed by the
defendant’s conduct. (Merced Irr. Dist. v. County of Mariposa (E.D. Cal.
2013) 941 F.Supp.2d 1237, 1280 [discussing California law].) Allegations must
demonstrate defendant’s conduct for failure or refusal to discharge contractual
responsibilities was a conscious and deliberate act, not an honest mistake, bad
judgment or negligence. (Ibid.) “‘[T]he
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is limited to assuring
compliance with the express terms of the contract and cannot be extended to
create obligations not contemplated by the contract.’” (Ragland v. U.S. Bank
Nat. Assn. (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 182, 206 [quoting Pasadena Live v.
City of Pasadena (2004) 114 Cal.App.4th 1089, 1094].)
b. Court’s
Determination
The Court finds in favor of the
Becerras.
The third cause of action and the
fourth cause of action center around the promissory note tied to the loans
alleged in this action, with the Becerras alleging that the default rate that
should have been charged in the foreclosure documents was 24% or “the maximum
interest rate allowed by law,” whichever is lesser, but where the foreclosure
documents have involved a 24% interest rate, not the legal maximum imposed by
California’s Constitution, thus breaching the contract by not charging the
permissible contractual rate in relation to default. (Complaint, ¶¶ 17-24,
55-58, 67-70.)
The third cause of action also
alleges a breach of the note by way of charging a default interest rate (24%)
that acts as a liquidated damages clause rather than a clause compensating the
lender for the expenses and costs associated with the monies wrongfully
withheld by default. (Complaint, ¶¶ 59-63.)
The Court notes that these claims
are only alleged against Roger Anderson, Trustee.
The Court determines that the first
of these two routes sufficiently supports the breach of contract claim, as
cited above. “A demurrer cannot rightfully be sustained to part of a cause of
action or to a particular type of damage or remedy.” (Kong
v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redevelopment Agency (2002) 108 Cal.App.4th
1028, 1047 (Kong); see Code Civ. Proc., § 430.50, subd. (a) [A
demurrer can be made to an entire complaint or individual causes of action
therein].) Thus, strictly for demurrer purposes, the Court need not rule on the
sufficiency of the second route to breach of contract insofar as another route
to breach of contract is sufficiently stated. (See Demurrer, 21:23-22:15.) The
Court also does not consider the evidence referenced in the demurrer, as based
on the Request for Judicial Notice discussion above. (Demurrer, 22:16-28.)
No other challenges on breach of
contract alone were stated in the moving papers.
As for the demurrer’s argument that
the breach of covenant claim fails because it is Roger Anderson, Trustee,
representing the trust, that is being denied the benefit of the bargain, not
the Becerras (Demurrer, p. 23), the Court has found otherwise above in
determining that a breach of contract claim is properly stated by the Becerras,
necessarily connoting they were denied the benefit of a bargain.
As for the reply’s argument that
the Complaint does not allege that Plaintiffs even paid the default rate on any
occasion, this argument appears to be raised for the first time on reply and
does not sufficiently elaborate on whether Plaintiff’s performance was excused
by breach of contract, as triggered when the foreclosure documents established
the 24% interest rate alleged in the Complaint. (Reply, p. 7.)
No other challenges exist to the
breach of covenant claim.
Roger Anderson, Trustee, FCI, and
Cal TD’s demurrer is thus OVERRULED as to the Complaint’s third and fourth causes
of action.
4. Demurrer,
Complaint, Fifth Cause of Action, Unfair Business Practices: OVERRULED.
a. Relevant
Law
To state a cause of action for
unfair business practices, a plaintiff must establish defendant engaged in “unlawful,
unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or
misleading advertising.” (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17200.) This section
establishes three types of unfair competition, prohibiting “practices that are
either ‘unfair,’ or ‘unlawful,’ or ‘fraudulent.’” (Pastoria v. Nationwide
Ins. (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1490, 1496.) Thus, “[a]n act or practice may be
actionable as “unfair” under the unfair competition law even if it is not ‘unlawful.’”
(Chavez v. Whirlpool Corp. (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 363, 374.) A violation
of other laws is deemed independently actionable under the UCL. (See Law
Offices of Mathew Higbee v. Expungement Assistance Servs. (2013) 214
Cal.App.4th 544, 554.) “‘Virtually any law—federal, state or local—can serve as
a predicate for a section 17200 action.’” (Ibid., quoting Troyk v.
Farmers Group, Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1305, 1335).) 
b. Court’s
Determination
Roger Anderson, Trustee, FCI, and
Cal TD’s demurrer is OVERRULED as to the Complaint’s fifth cause of action—stated
against all Defendants—because the claim is derivative of the other claims
alleged in the Complaint, which have survived demurrer. (Complaint, ¶¶ 80-99; see
discussions supra re: usury, elder abuse, breach of contract claims, slander of
title, and fraud claims.)
5. Demurrer,
Complaint, Sixth Cause of Action, Slander of Title: OVERRULED.
a. Relevant
Law
The
elements of slander of title are the following: (1) a publication; (2) without
privilege or justification; (3) that is false; and (4) causes direct and
immediate pecuniary loss. (M.F. Farming, Co. v. Couch Distributing Co.
(2012) 207 Cal.App.4th 180, 198-199 (M.F. Farming).)
Slander
of title occurs when one publishes untrue and disparaging statements about
someone else’s property that would lead a reasonable person to foresee that a
prospective purchaser or lessee might abandon his intentions. (Id. at p.
198.) It diminishes the vendibility of property. (Id. at 199.) To be
disparaging, a statement need not be a complete denial of title in others but
may be any unfounded claim of an interest in the property which casts doubt
upon its ownership. (Ibid.)
b. Court’s
Determination
Here, the slander of title claim is
derivative of the usury claim facts insofar as it is premised on the alleged
recordation of documents that slandered the Becerra’s title to the real
property at issue. (Complaint, ¶¶ 17-24, 104-105, 107.) The Complaint also
bases slander of title on the payoff demands alleged in the Complaint.
(Complaint, ¶¶ 106, 107.)
The Court notes that this claim is
only alleged against Roger Anderson, Trustee, and FCI, and does not include Cal
TD.
The demurrer’s primary argument is
that the recordation of the notice of default (NOD) and the notice of trustee’s
sale (NOTS) is privileged under Schep v. Capital One, N.A. (2017) 12
Cal.App.5th 1331, 1336-1338 (Schep) as purportedly holding that “the
recording of a trustee’s deed upon sale [wa]s privileged” in Schep.
(Demurrer, pp. 24-25; see Reply, p. 8.)
However, the demurrer recognizes
that allegations of malice can overcome the privilege. As discussed in Schep:
“Of course, section 47 creates two
privileges: (1) an absolute privilege, commonly called the litigation
privilege, that applies irrespective of the speaker’s motive (§ 47, subd. (b));
and (2) a qualified privilege that ‘applies only to communications made without
malice’ (id., subd. (c)). (Hagberg v. California Federal Bank
(2004) 32 Cal.4th 350, 360, 7 Cal.Rptr.3d 803, 81 P.3d 244.) Section 2924,
subdivision (d), refers only to ‘Section 47’ without specifying which of the
two privileges applies. The courts have split on this question. (Compare Kachlon,
supra, 168 Cal.App.4th at pp. 335-341, 85 Cal.Rptr.3d 532 [section 2924 incorporates
§ 47’s qualified privilege] with Garretson v. Post (2007) 156
Cal.App.4th 1508, 1517, 68 Cal.Rptr.3d 230 [section 2924 incorporates § 47’s
absolute privilege].) We need not take a position on this issue because the
publication of documents at issue in this case are privileged even under
section 47’s narrower qualified privilege.
For the purposes of section 47’s
qualified privilege, ‘malice’ means that the defendant (1) ‘“was motivated by
hatred or ill will towards the plaintiff,”’ or (2) ‘“lacked reasonable grounds
for [its] belief in the truth of the publication and therefore acted in
reckless disregard of the plaintiff’s rights.’” (Sanborn v. Chronicle Pub.
Co. (1976) 18 Cal.3d 406, 413, 134 Cal.Rptr. 402, 556 P.2d 764; Taus v.
Loftus (2007) 40 Cal.4th 683, 721, 54 Cal.Rptr.3d 775, 151 P.3d 1185; §
48a, subd. (d)(4) [defining ‘actual malice’ as ‘hatred or ill will toward the
plaintiff’].)”
(Schep, supra, 12
Cal.App.5th at p. 1337.)
The Court adopts its discussions
supra to determine that the recordation of the NOD and NOTS were recorded in
reckless disregard of Plaintiff’s state constitutional rights against usurious
interest rates, where Defendants could have foreseen that, for example, a
purchaser (or substitute lender) might be affected by the recordation of an NOD
and a NOTS, as stating a usurious interest rate.
The other argument in the demurrer
is that the slander of title claim fails insofar as it is premised on
non-recorded payoff demands. The Court does not reach the merit of this
argument because the Court cannot sustain a demurrer to a portion of a pleaded
count. (Kong, supra, 108 Cal.App.4th at p. 1047; see Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.50, subd. (a).)
Roger Anderson, Trustee, FCI, and
Cal TD’s demurrer is thus OVERRULED as to the Complaint’s sixth cause of
action.
6. Demurrer,
Complaint, Seventh and Eighth Causes of Action, Fraud and Negligent
Misrepresentation: OVERRULED.
a. Relevant
Law
Intentional misrepresentation
involves “(1) a knowingly false representation by the defendant; (2) an intent
to deceive or induce reliance; (3) justifiable reliance by the plaintiff; and
(4) resulting damages.” (Service by Medallion, Inc. v. Clorox Co. (1996)
44 Cal.App.4th 1807, 1816.)
Negligent misrepresentation
involves (1) an assertion, as a fact, of that which is not true, (2) by one who
has no reasonable ground for believing it to be true, (3) made with intent to
induce the recipient to alter his position to his injury or his risk, (4) with
justifiable reliance on the representation, and (5) resulting damage. (B.L.M.
v. Sabo & Deitsch (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 823, 834.)
Allegations of fraud “must be pled
with more detail than other causes of action.” (Apollo Capital Fund, LLC v.
Roth Capital Partners, LLC (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 226, 240.) “Every element
of the cause of action for fraud must be alleged … factually and
specifically[,] and the policy of liberal construction of the pleadings … will
not ordinarily be invoked to sustain a pleading defective in any material
respect. [Citations.]” (Committee on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General
Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 216, superseded by statute as stated in Branick
v. Downey Savings & Loan Assn. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 235, 242.) A plaintiff
pleading fraud must plead facts showing “how, when, where, to whom, and by what
means” the allegedly fraudulent representations were tendered. (Lazar v.
Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645.) “[G]eneral and conclusory
allegations do not suffice.” (Small v. Fritz Cos., Inc. (2003) 30
Cal.4th 167, 184 [citations omitted].)
However, generally, “less
particularity [of pleading] is required where the defendant may be assumed to
possess knowledge of the facts at least equal, if not superior, to that
possessed by the plaintiff,” which certainly is the case here. (Burks v.
Poppy Construction Co. (1962) 57 Cal.2d 463, 474.)
b. Court’s
Determination
The Court finds in favor of the
Becerras.
The Court notes that these claims
are only alleged against Roger Anderson, Trustee, and FCI, and do not include
Cal TD.
The fraud claims in this action
center around Roger Anderson, Trustee, and FCI making misrepresentations in the
NOD and NOTS as to the correct debt owed on the property, where these notices
incorrectly based the debt on a usurious 12% interest rate between February 1,
2023, and April 1, 2023, and a usurious 24% interest rate from May 1, 2023.  (Complaint, ¶¶ 118-124, 130-135.)
The Court disagrees with
Defendants’ argument that there is no misrepresentation alleged. Based on the
Court’s above determinations, there is conceivably a misrepresentation as to
the proper amounts owed under the loan agreements between the Becerras and
Roger Anderson, Trustee, on behalf of the trust.
The Court next determines that the
demurrer’s arguments contending that the Complaint does not allege justifiable
reliance or damages is contradicted by the pleadings. (Complaint, ¶¶ 121, 132
[reliance]; Complaint, ¶¶ 122-124, 133-135 [damages].)
Roger Anderson, Trustee, FCI, and
Cal TD’s demurrer is thus OVERRULED as to the Complaint’s seventh and eighth causes
of action.
 
III. Motion to Strike
A. Requests for Judicial Notice
The Court adopts its discussion
supra at section II.A. to dispose of the requests for judicial notice, which
were equally requested as to the demurrer and motion to strike.
B. Legal Standard
The court may, upon a motion or at
any time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (a) strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (b) strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court. (Code Civ. Proc. §
436, subds. (a), (b); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter
in a pleading which is not essential to the claim is surplusage; probative
facts are surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].)
For the purposes of a motion to
strike pursuant to Sections 435 to 437 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the term
“pleading” generally means a demurrer, answer, complaint, or cross-complaint,
(Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (a)), and an immaterial allegation or irrelevant
matter in a pleading entails (1) an allegation that is not essential to the
statement of a claim or defense, (2) an allegation that is neither pertinent to
nor supported by an otherwise sufficient claim or defense, or (3) a demand for
judgment requesting relief not supported by the allegations of the complaint or
cross-complaint (Code Civ. Proc., § 431.10, subds. (b)(1)-(3), (c)).
In analyzing a motion to strike,
California courts “accept as true the well-pleaded allegations” in the
challenged pleadings, as well as “well-pleaded allegations admitted in” the
responsive “answer.” (Atwell Island Water Dist. v. Atwell Island Water
District (2020) 45 Cal.App.5th 624, 628 (Atwell); Clauson v.
Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1253, 1255 [California courts “read
allegations of a pleading subject to a motion to strike as a whole, all parts
in their context, and assume their truth”].)
C. Analysis
1. Motion
to Strike, Complaint, Punitive Damages: 
a. Relevant
Law
“In an action for the breach of an
obligation not arising from contract, where it is proven by clear and
convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or
malice, the plaintiff, in addition to the actual damages, may recover damages
for the sake of example and by way of punishing the defendant.” (Civ. Code, §
3294, subd. (a); College Hospital Inc. v. Superior Court (1994) 8
Cal.4th 704, 725 (College Hospital) [explaining amendments requiring “despicable”
conduct for malice and oppression].)
When the defendant is a
corporation, ‘[a]n award of punitive damages … must rest on the malice of the
corporation’s employees’” specifically, “the oppression, fraud, or malice
perpetrated, authorized, or knowingly ratified by an officer, director, or
managing agent of the corporation,” where a managing agent “include[s] only
those corporate employees who exercise substantial independent authority and
judgment in their corporate decisionmaking so that their decisions ultimately
determine corporate policy.’” (Wilson v. Southern California Edison Co.
(2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 123, 164, citations omitted.)
b. Court’s
Determination
The Court adopts its demurrer
discussions—particularly usury, elder abuse, malice in the slander of title
claim, and fraud (two claims)—to determine that sufficient non-conclusory
allegations of oppression, malice, and fraud have been alleged for the purpose
of punitive damages.
Because the demurrer does not
address authorization, ratification, etc., the Court does not discuss this
element of punitive damages.
Roger Anderson, Trustee, FCI, and
Cal TD’s demurrer is thus DENIED as to the Complaint’s punitive damages prayer.
(Mot., p. 2, Notice, ¶ 15.)
2. Motion
to Strike, Complaint, Purported Conclusions of Law and Scandalous Verbiage:
DENIED.
The Court also DENIES Roger
Anderson, Trustee, FCI, and Cal TD’s motion to strike various “scandalous”
allegations in the Complaint—words such as “illegal,” “unlawful,” “usurious,”
and “false.” (See Mot., p. 2, Notice, ¶¶ 1-14.)
Though perhaps somewhat
inflammatory in a common sense, the language used in the Complaint relates to direct
allegations of unlawful activity by Defendants: charging usurious interest
rates and then attempting to foreclose on a debt informed by those rates. Thus,
the challenged language, even if colorful, is relevant to the pleadings,
undermining the requested relief.

of the RWA Trust Dated March 14, 2014, FCI Lender Services Inc., and California
TD Specialists’ Demurrer to Complaint is OVERRULED.
B. Motion to Strike
