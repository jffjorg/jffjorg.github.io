 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Cross-Defendant
  Stallion, Inc.’s Motion to Deem Objections to Production Demand to be Without
  Merit; to Compel a Code Compliant Response to the Production Demand and for
  Sanctions Against Cross-Complainant and His Attorney.



 
I. Background
On February 16, 2024, Cross-Defendant Stallion, Inc. (Stallion)
filed a motion to compel further responses to six production requests served on
Cross-Plaintiff Michael Pappas (Michael Pappas) around December 5, 2023 (hereafter, RPDs,
Set One, Nos. 1-6), to which Michael Pappas served objection-only responses on
January 8, 2024.
On May 31, 2024,
Michael Pappas filed an opposition. The opposition argues that this motion is
moot because Michael Pappas served supplemental responses to RPDs, Set One, Nos. 1-6 on May 29, 2024. A
review of the proof of service for the opposition shows that service was
effected on Stallion’s counsel at a P.O. box address, which is the same address
that appears in the proof of service attached to Stallion’s February 20, 2024,
motion, as well as its March 28, 2023, Answer to Cross-Complaint.
No reply appears in the
record.
Stallion’s motion is
now before the Court.
 
II. Motion to Compel Further
Production and Motion for Sanctions
A.
Motion to Compel Further Production: MOOT.
1. Legal Standard
A
motion to compel a further response is used when a party gives unsatisfactory
answers or makes untenable objections to interrogatories, demands to produce,
or requests for admission. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a); Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 403(Sinaiko).)
To
request further production, a movant must establish: (1) good cause for the
production (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1); Sinaiko, supra,
at p. 403); and (2) that a further response is needed because (a) the
responding party’s statement of compliance with the demand to produce is
incomplete Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(1)), (b) the responding
party’s representation that it is unable to comply is inadequate, complete, or
evasive (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(2)), (c) the responding party’s
objection in the response is without merit or is too general (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.310, subd. (a)(3); Catalina Island Yacht Club v. Superior Court
(2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1127), or (d) if the responding party objected to
the production of ESI on the ground that it is not reasonably accessible the
movant can show that the (i) ESI is reasonably accessible or (ii) there is good
cause for production of the ESI regardless of its accessibility (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (e)).
2. Analysis

“Whether a particular response does
resolve satisfactorily the issues raised by a motion is a matter best
determined by the trial court in the exercise of its discretion, based on the
circumstances of the case.” (Sinaiko, supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at
p. 409.)
Here, the Court determines that
Stallion’s motion is MOOT as to further responses.
Stallion served RPDs, Set One, Nos.
1-6 on Michael Pappas around December 5, 2023, in response to which Plaintiff
served objection only responses. (Mot., Kalajian Decl., Exs. A, B.)
On May 29, 2024, Stallion served
supplemental responses to RPDs, Set One, Nos. 1-6. A review of these responses
shows statements satisfying Code of Civil Procedure section 2021.230. These
responses represent that Michael Pappas has made a diligent search and
reasonable inquiry into the production requests and has been unable to locate
responsive documents, giving distinct reasons for why responsive documents were
not located as to each of the production requests. (Opp’n, Abramson Decl., Ex.
1, Supplemental Responses to RPDs, Set One, Nos. 1-6.)
Based on these responses, the Court
determines that Stallion’s motion is moot insofar as it seeks an order
compelling further responses to RPDs, Set One, Nos. 1-6.
B. Motion for Sanctions: GRANTED
in part.
1. Legal
Standard
Except in certain circumstances
involving electronic stored information, the court must impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel
further response to a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd.
(h).)
The court may award sanctions under the
Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even
though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was
withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).)
2. Analysis
The Court GRANTS sanctions in part
as follows.
There was a nearly five-month delay
between service of the initial January 8, 2024, objection-only responses and
service of the supplemental responses on May 29, 2024.
Michael Pappas’s opposition argues
and cites evidence for the contention that the objection-only responses were
served in light of scheduling difficulties for counsel, which necessitated a
continuance that counsel for Stallion refused to accommodate. (Opp’n, Abramson
Decl., ¶¶ 3-6, 10, Exs. 2-4.)
Michael Pappas’s opposition also
details post-January 8, 2024, time conflicts arising from (1) the death of
Michael Pappas’s brother, where Michael Pappas was appointed executor in charge
of administering the estate, (2) the frequent travel of Michael Pappas, and (3)
the birth of counsel’s first grandchild in Arizona. The death of Michael
Pappas’s brother is stated as having occurred in January 2024, while the birth
of counsel’s grandchild is represented to have occurred in February 2024, with
the estate proceedings continuing in February 2024 as well. (Opp’n, Abramson
Decl., ¶¶ 11-12.)
However, the same evidence shows
that counsel for Stallion refused the extension request based on past extensions
resulting in purportedly inconsistent and evasive responses from Michael Pappas
and where the client, Stallion, did not wish to provide an extension. (Opp’n,
Abramson Decl., Ex. 4.)
The moving papers’ evidence, in
turn, shows that the objections were asserted on January 8, 2024, seemingly to
preserve objections while also promising to “get [Stallion’s counsel]
supplemental answers to the discovery and requested documents in the next 14
days.” (Mot., Kalajian Decl., Ex. B.)
Stallion’s counsel’s declaration attached
to the moving papers also details emails between counsel on January 28, January
30, and February 2, 2024, which are quoted in the declaration rather than
incorporated by attachment. Those efforts included Michael Pappas’s counsel
asking for more time to produce discovery in relation to RPDs, Set One, Nos.
1-6 and promising to produce discovery twice by a certain date only to fail to
serve discovery by those dates. (Mot., Kalajian Decl., ¶¶ 8-11.)
Under these circumstances, the
Court relies on California Rule of Court, rule 3.1348(a) to determine that even
though supplemental responses were served, sanctions may still be imposed on
Michael Pappas and his counsel, John M. Kalajian for failing to respond to an
authorized method of discovery in RPDs, Set One, Nos. 1-6, through May 29, 2024.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.010, subd. (d), 2023.030, subd. (a), 2031.310, subd.
(h).)
The Court however, will reduce the
amount awarded. Counsel’s declaration shows experience and skill supporting the
modest $400 per hour fee rate. The declaration sets out a ceiling of $1,600 in
monetary sanctions, connoting four hours of work by counsel on this motion and
on the hearing, which is reasonable. Last, the $60 motion fee is reasonable.
As to joint and several sanctions,
the Court orders sanctions be paid jointly and severally by counsel. While the
Court understands that estate and family matters conflicted with production in
January and February 2024, supplemental responses were not served until May 29,
2024, well beyond January and February 2024. (Opp’n, Abramson Decl., ¶¶ 10-15.)
It is unclear why this delay took place, but the evidence attached to the
moving papers represents that Michael Pappas’s counsel agreed to serve
production following the January 8, 2024, objections only to twice fail to make
production. (Mot., Kalajian Decl., ¶¶ 8-11.) Under these circumstances,
sanctions against Michael Pappas and counsel appear appropriate.
However, the Court, in the
interests of justice, reduces the sanctions amount to $860 as opposed to the
requested $1,660, splitting the $1,600 requested in pure sanctions between the
parties to balance the emergencies that arose in relation to Michael Pappas and
counsel.
Sanctions are thus GRANTED, in
part, as against Michael Pappas and counsel, Joe R. Abramson, Esq. (SBN 105241),
jointly and severally.

Production
Cross-Defendant Stallion, Inc.’s

Cross-Complainant Michael Pappas
and counsel, Joe R. Abramson, Esq. (SBN 105241), are ordered, jointly and
severally, to remit sanctions of $860 to Cross-Defendant Stallion, Inc. within 14
