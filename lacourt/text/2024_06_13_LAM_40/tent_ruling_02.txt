Defendant Bruce
  Marder’s Motion for Reconsideration of Order Denying Bond, or, in the
  Alternative, Informal Request for Reconsideration.



 
I. Background
A. Pleadings
Plaintiff Steve Wallace sues
Defendants Bruce Marder, Capo L.P., Capo, LLC, and Does 1-25 pursuant to an
October 25, 2023, Complaint alleging claims of (1) Breach of Fiduciary Duty
(direct and derivative), (2) Breach of Contract (monetary and injunctive
relief), (3) Conversion (direct and derivative – monetary and equitable
relief), (4) Accounting, (5) Declaratory Relief (including injunctive relief),
(6) Financial Elder Abuse (Welf. & Ins. Code, § 15610.30, (7) Dissolution
(Corp. Code § 15908.02), and (8) Expulsion of General Partner (Corp. Code §
15906.03).
The claims arise from the following
allegations. In 1996, Defendant Marder invited Plaintiff Wallace and others to
invest in a new restaurant venture that would operate under the name “Capo.” To
accomplish this purpose, Defendant Marder formed Defendant Capo, LLC to act as
general partner to Defendant Capo, L.P., which in turn is the entity that
operates the restaurant. Plaintiff Wallace currently owns a 16.7% interest in Capo,
LLC, the general partner of Capo, L.P., in which Plaintiff Wallace is in turn a
3.2% limited partner. Based on these interests, Plaintiff Wallace is entitled
to a share of revenues generated by “Capo” the restaurant, which are
distributed from Capo, L.P. to Capo, LLC for subsequent distribution to the
members in Capo, LLC. Defendants Marder and Does 1-10 have, in connection with
a project in Napa Valley, California, engaged in conduct that has resulted in
harm to Capo, LLC, Capo, L.P., and Plaintiff Wallace, such as: (a) converting
personal property of Capo, L.P. for their own uses; (b) converting revenue
earned by Capo, L.P. to their own uses; (c) taking excessive fees and expenses
from Capo, L.P.; (d) failing to pay Capo, LLC its proper and fair share of
revenue; (e) failing to distribute revenues received by Capo, LLC to its members
pro rata; and (f) other breaches of fiduciary duty and wrongdoing according to
proof at trial.
B. Relevant
Procedural History
On January 12, 2024, Defendant
Marder filed a motion to stay this action and to require a $50,000 bond from
Plaintiff Wallace to proceed on any derivative claims on behalf of Capo, LLC on
the ground that Plaintiff can show no reasonable possibility that the
prosecution of such causes of action will benefit that company or its
members.  (Notice of Motion.)
On March 11, 2024, Plaintiff
Wallace filed an opposition, and on March 15, 2024, Defendant Marder filed a
reply.
On March 28, 2024, the
motion to stay came before the Court, at which time the Court heard oral
argument and took the matter under submission.
On April 2, 2024, the
Court denied the motion to stay. The order noted that relief was only sought as
to Capo, LLC, and denied relief on the grounds that Plaintiff has alleged that
he is a member of Capo, LLC, which is entitled to payments from Capo, L.P., and
that Plaintiff has alleged sufficient futility in demand based on Marder’s
controlling interest in Capo, L.P., and Capo, LLC.
C. Motion Before the
Court
On April 16, 2024,
Defendant Marder filed a motion for reconsideration of the April 2, 2024,
ruling.
On June 3, 2024,
Plaintiff Wallace filed an opposition, and on June 6, 2024, Defendant Marder
filed a reply.
Defendant Marder’s
motion is now before the Court.
 
II. Reply Request to Not Consider Untimely Opposition
A. Legal Standard
When an
opposing party expressly objects to inadequate notice but then opposes the
motion on the merits, the issue of defective notice may be waived unless the
opposing party makes a request for a continuance or demonstrates prejudice from
the defective notice. (Carlton v. Quint (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 690, 697 (Carlton);
Reedy v. Bussell (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 1272, 1288 (Reedy); see
also Robinson v. Woods (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1258, 1264 [When a party only “respond[s] to [a]
[late-served] motion by filing a written opposition containing only the notice
objections and never argue[s] the merits,” no waiver occurs, such that the
objecting party need “not … [even] claim or show prejudice [to object to the
late-served motion] because the[] [plaintiffs] did not address the merits [of
the motion], in writing or otherwise”]; contra. Boyle v. CertainTeed Corp.
(2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 645, 650 [“A party’s participation in a hearing after
the party’s objection to the hearing as unauthorized does not constitute waiver
by acquiescence”].)

B. Analysis
The Court DENIES the
reply request to not consider the late-filed opposition.
This hearing is being
held on June 13, 2024, meaning that the opposition was due on May 31, 2024,
nine court days prior to the hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).)
However, the opposition was filed on June 3, 2024, with no explanation as to
delay.
However, the reply
fails to raise prejudice in relation to defective notice, and the reply further
does not request a continuance. Instead, the reply argues the opposition points
on the merits. Moreover, the opposition is one court day late, i.e., should
have been filed and served on a Friday, but was filed and served on a Monday. Under
these circumstances, the Court relies on Carlton and Reedy in determining
that the issue of defective notice has been waived, and further determines that
the delay was not prejudicial.
 
III. Motion for Reconsideration:
DENIED as to reconsideration by party request but GRANTED as to sua sponte
reconsideration to again DENY motion to stay action and post bond, with greater
clarity as to evidence in support.

A. Legal Standard
A motion
for reconsideration is used to ask the court to modify, amend, or revoke its
earlier order on a prior motion to the court because of new or different facts,
circumstances, or law. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (a).) Such an order may
involve an interim or final order (see Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subds. (e),
(h)), where an interim order is an intermediate ruling of some kind that
requires further proceedings before the suit can be resolved, and where a final
order is an order that finally disposes of the suit (see People v. DeLouize
(2004) 32 Cal.4th 1223, 1231 [differentiating between interim and final
orders]).
A
motion for reconsideration may be brought by a party or by the court on its own
motion. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subds. (a), (c).) The grounds for the
motion vary depending on whether a party or the Court is making the motion.
(See Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subds. (a), (c), (e).)
A
party may move for reconsideration based on: (1) new or different facts, (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (a); see e.g., In re Marriage of LaMoure
(2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 1463, 1473 [reconsideration motion granted on new
evidence]); (2) new or different circumstances, (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd.
(a)); and (3) new or different law, (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (a); Baldwin
v. Home Sav. of Am. (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1192, 1196.)
However,
a party cannot move for reconsideration based on the court’s erroneous order,
i.e., the court’s misinterpretation of facts or law. (See Jones v. P.S. Dev.
Co. (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 707, 724, disapproved on other grounds by Reid
v. Google, Inc. (2010) 50 Cal.4th 512, 531-532, 532 n. 4; Gilbert v. AC
Transit (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1494, 1500.) Instead, a party can suggest to
the court that it should reconsider its erroneous order on its own motion so
long as the suggestion is not made ex parte. (Le Francois v. Goel (2005)
35 Cal.4th 1094, 1108; see e.g., In re Marriage of Spector (2018) 24
Cal.App.5th 201, 214-15 [emails husband sent to court about erroneous order
were not ex parte because wife was copied on all emails].)
By
contrast, the Court has statutory authority to reconsider final orders and
interim orders based on a change in law. (Civ. Proc., § 1008, subds. (c), (e).)
California
courts also have a broader constitutional authority to reconsider interim
orders that are erroneous that goes beyond Code of Civil Procedure section
1008. (Brown, Winfield & Canzoneri, Inc. v. Superior Court (2010) 47
Cal.4th 1233, 1248 [courts have constitutional authority to reconsider interim
orders]; Le Francois, supra, 35 Cal.4th at p. 1108 [“If a court
believes one of its prior interim orders was erroneous, it should be able to
correct that error no matter how it came to acquire that belief”].)
Case
law suggests that while California courts generally do not possess a
constitutional authority to reconsider erroneous final orders, a court may correct
an error in legal reasoning as to a final order subject to appeal but before
the time to appeal has expired. (See e.g., In re Marriage of Spector, supra,
24 Cal.App.5th at p. 215; In re Marriage of Barthold (2008) 158
Cal.App.4th 1301, 1312-1313, 1313, fn. 9.)

B. Court’s Determination
1. Merits of Reconsideration
For the following reasons, the
Court DENIES Defendant Marder’s motion for reconsideration as based on due
process concerns in favor of GRANTING the alternative relief requested, i.e.,
for the Court to exercise its inherent power to reconsider the April 2, 2024, order—though
the Court notes that it reaches the same disposition as its prior order.
The Court agrees that the April 2,
2024, order did not provide sufficient clarity as to its evidentiary basis. The
Court thus makes the below determination superseding the April 2, 2024, order, so
as to correct this error.
The Court also notes that the
“controlling interest” language in the April 2, 2024, order was a
misinterpretation that does not factor into the following ruling.
2. Merits of
Motion to Stay Action and Post Bond
The Court again finds in favor of
Plaintiff Wallace.
The Court notes that it does not
address the brief argument in the opposition that the moving papers’ evidence
is inadmissible hearsay, which was not raised as a standalone objection and is
unclear as to what portion of the moving papers is being objected to.
The Court also again notes that
while Plaintiff is asserting derivative claims both as to Capo L.P., a limited
partnership, and Capo, LLC, a limited liability company, the motion to stay and
post bond sought a stay and post of bond as to Capo, LLC alone.
Here, Plaintiff’s evidence filed in
opposition to the motion to stay and post bond supports the Complaint’s
allegations that Plaintiff has an interest in Capo, LLC—a derivative claim as
argued in the moving papers. (Complaint, ¶¶ 12, 15; 3/11/24 Opp’n, Greenspan
Decl., ¶ 12 & Wallace Decl., ¶ 2.) Nothing in any of the cases cited by
Marder hold that a shareholder cannot bring two derivative claims on behalf of
two related entities. 
The Court notes that because the
motion to stay and post bond related to Capo, LLC alone, the “direct claim”
arguments that allegedly arose at oral argument are not a basis for the Court’s
decision. Neither is it clear how Defendant Marder was prejudiced as to this
point by the April 2, 2024, ruling where the ruling did not mention the direct
versus derivative claim distinction and instead simply pointed to the
allegations supporting Plaintiff Wallace’s interest in Capo, LLC, and the
allegations supporting futility. (4/2/24 Ruling, p. 3 at § III.B.2.)
Next, evidence filed in opposition
to the motion to stay and post bond supports the Complaint’s allegations of
futility in demand, specifically through evidence that the only other managing
member in Capo, LLC has absented himself from the LLC’s business for four years,
for which reason, in effect, Defendant Marder controls Capo, LLC, making a
demand futile. (Complaint, ¶¶ 14, 24, 37, 42 [futility based on total control
of Capo, LLC]; 3/11/24 Opp’n, Morris Decl., ¶¶ [authentication], Ex. 1 [2/28/24
email from counsel for Marvin Zeidler to counsel for Plaintiff Wallace
indicating that Marvin Zeidler has not participated in Capo’s business affairs
for four years, since before the COVID-19 pandemic].)
The Court notes that this determination
of futility is based on the allegations in the Complaint regarding futility
through de facto control and Plaintiff’s March 11, 2024, evidence showing the
only other managing member of Capo, LLC has not been involved with business
operations for more than four years, thus showing de facto control of Capo, LLC
by Defendant Marder. Moreover, Defendant Marder’s defense in this action has
been to deny liability and frame the conduct alleged in the Complaint as
falling under the business judgment rule, supporting futility. (See, e.g., 1/12/24
Mot., 9-10.)
Under these circumstances, there
appears to be a “reasonable possibility that the prosecution of the cause of
action alleged in the complaint against the moving party will benefit the
limited liability company” Capo, LLC because Plaintiff Wallace is attempting to
vindicate Capo, LLC’s rights to receive a proper and fair share of revenue
generated by Capo, L.P. (Corp. Code § 17709.02, subd. (b)(1).)
Based on the above reasoning, the
Court again DENIES the motion to stay and post bond. 
IV. Conclusion
Defendant Bruce Marder’s Motion for Reconsideration of Order Denying
Bond, or, in the Alternative, Informal Request for Reconsideration is DENIED as
to reconsideration based on party request but is GRANTED as to sua sponte
reconsideration of the Court’s April 2, 2024, order, with the Court again
DENYING Defendant Marder’s motion to stay action and post bond as more fully set
forth above.
