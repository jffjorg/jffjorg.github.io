And here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the cross-defendant's motion to deem the objections to production requests to be without merit and to compel a compliant response to the production demand. The court finds that the motion to compel further production is moot because the plaintiff has already served supplemental responses to the production requests. However, the court grants the motion for sanctions in part, finding that the plaintiff's counsel failed to respond to the production requests in a timely manner. The court reduces the amount of sanctions awarded, ordering the plaintiff's counsel to pay $860 in sanctions to the cross-defendant.
