And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for summary judgment filed by The Hertz Corporation. The case involves a motor vehicle accident in which Matthew Ellison, who was driving a rental vehicle owned by Hertz, allegedly caused harm to the plaintiffs, Eduard Davtyan and Grigor Davtyan. Hertz claims that it is not liable for the accident because it did not negligently entrust the vehicle to Ellison. The judge has denied Hertz's motion for summary judgment, finding that a triable issue of fact exists regarding negligent entrustment. The judge has also concluded that the Graves Amendment, which provides immunity to rental car companies in certain circumstances, does not apply in this case because Hertz failed to meet its burden of showing that it did not negligently entrust the vehicle to Ellison. The case will proceed to trial.
