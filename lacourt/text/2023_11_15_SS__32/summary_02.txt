And here is the English summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling suggests that the case is not ready for summary judgment. Despite the Plaintiff's argument that the vehicle was rented to Jacinta Evans Ellison, not Matthew Ellison, the Judge finds that there is no evidence presented that Hertz inspected the driver's license of Jacinta Evans Ellison. The Defendant argues that the Plaintiff has no evidence of Hertz's alleged negligent entrustment, but the Judge finds that neither party has addressed the potential evidence regarding the Hertz employee who rented the vehicle and that person's compliance with Vehicle Code section 14608. Additionally, the Defendant failed to set forth any facts regarding the motor vehicle or negligence claims.
