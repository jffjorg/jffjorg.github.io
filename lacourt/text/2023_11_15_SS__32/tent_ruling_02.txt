[1] Although
Plaintiff argues that the automobile was rented to Jacinta Evans Ellison and
not Matthew Ellison (the driver of the vehicle at the time of the subject
incident), the Vehicle Code refers to “the person to whom the vehicle is
rented.” There is no evidence presented that Hertz inspected the driver’s
license of Jacinta Evans Ellison.


[2] Defendant
argues that Plaintiffs have no evidence of Hertz’s alleged negligent
entrustment. (UMF 9.) However, on summary judgment, Defendant must establish
that Plaintiff could not reasonably obtain evidence that would allow a fact
finder to find a material fact. Here, neither party addresses the potential
evidence regarding the Hertz employee who rented the vehicle and that person’s
compliance with Vehicle Code section 14608. Accordingly, the Court cannot find
as a matter of law that Plaintiff could not reasonably obtain sufficient evidence.


[3]
Defendant did not set forth any facts regarding the motor vehicle or negligence
claims.
