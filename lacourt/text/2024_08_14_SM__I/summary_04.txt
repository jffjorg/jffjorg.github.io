And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the case. The only motion on calendar is the defendant's motion for a stay. The plaintiff has objected to the Ran declaration, which was signed in China, but the judge has overruled the objection. The judge notes that there is no authority that requires a declaration signed in a foreign country to be done in a unique way, and that the Ran declaration contains a proper jurat.

The judge is inclined to grant the motion for a stay because the plaintiff is subject to an arbitration agreement and there is already an arbitration proceeding pending. The judge finds that the arbitration agreement is enforceable and that the dispute is subject to arbitration, at least in the first instance.

The judge also notes that the plaintiff's whistleblower allegations do not exempt the dispute from arbitration, and that the court's role is limited to determining whether there is a contract to arbitrate. The judge grants the motion for a stay and orders that the case be stayed pending the outcome of the arbitration already started by the plaintiff. The judge sets a status conference to ensure that the case moves forward.
