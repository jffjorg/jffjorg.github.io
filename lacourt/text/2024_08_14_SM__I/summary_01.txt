And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively granted the application, but notes that the parties have not shown sufficient diligence. The trial and FSC dates are vacated, and the court will discuss with the parties when a new date should be set. Given the court's calendar, it is unclear whether the new date will be in 2025. The judge is granting the application reluctantly, as it is unlikely to serve a purpose to deny the application only to continue the case anyway, considering the trial date is already set.
