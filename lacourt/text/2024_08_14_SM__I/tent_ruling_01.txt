  Case Number:  23SMCV00287    Hearing Date:   August 14, 2024    Dept:  I The application is reluctantly GRANTED.  The fact is that the court will almost
certainly be engaged in trial on 9/23/24, which is the current trial date.  As such, no purpose would be served in
denying the application only to then continue the case anyway.  But that said, the court does not think that
the parties have truly shown diligence here, and were the court not otherwise
engaged, the motion might very well have been denied. 
 
Be that as it may, the trial and FSC dates are VACATED.  The court will discuss with the parties when
the new date should be.  Given the
court’s calendar, it is not clear that it will be in 2025.
