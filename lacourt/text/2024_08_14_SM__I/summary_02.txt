```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the cross-complaint. The judge sustains the demurrer to the prescriptive easement, finding that the use of the wall and landscaping by 7ZERO1 is exclusive and therefore not a prescriptive easement. However, the judge overrules the demurrer to the equitable easement, finding that 7ZERO1 has pled enough to defeat the demurrer. The judge also overrules the demurrer to the negligence claim, finding that 7ZERO1 has pled enough to defeat the demurrer.

The judge allows 7ZERO1 30 days' leave to amend the cross-complaint to address the issues raised in the demurrer. The judge notes that the prescriptive easement claim is problematic because it requires exclusive use, which is not permitted. The judge also notes that the equitable easement claim is a viable alternative, but that 7ZERO1 will have to pay Pakravan for the use of the property if the easement is granted.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling is significant because it clarifies the issues in the case and provides guidance to the parties on how to proceed.
