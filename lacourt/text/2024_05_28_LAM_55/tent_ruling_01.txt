  Case Number:  23STCV02102    Hearing Date:   May 28, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Devion Furniture’s Compliance with Business
Records Subpoena, and Request for Sanctions of $918.
 
BACKGROUND
LILOLA HOME LLC and LAKUTA INC. (“Plaintiffs”) filed a
Complaint against OAH FURNITURE INC. et al. (“Defendants”), alleging that
Defendants are alter egos and breached written contracts Plaintiffs entered
into with Defendant OADEER HOME, including by selling their
furniture to Plaintiff’s clients. The causes of action are (1) Breach of the
Commission Agreement, (2) Breach of the NDA, (3) Breach of the Supplier and
Distributor Agreement, (4) Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and
Fair Dealing, (5) Fraud, (6) Intentional Interference with Contractual
Relations, (7) Violation of Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200; and (8) Conspiracy.
Plaintiffs have filed a motion requesting an order compelling
nonparty Devion Furniture (“Devion”) to comply with a business records subpoena,
and imposing $918 in moentary sanctions.
LEGAL STANDARD
A party may bring a motion to compel a non-party
witness to obey a deposition subpoena. Person v. Farmers Ins. Group of Cos.
(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 813, 818. 
“If the party seeking a monetary sanction meets its
burden of proof, the burden shifts to the opposing party attempting to avoid a
monetary sanction to show that it acted with ‘substantial justification.’” Doe
v. U.S. Swimming, Inc. (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1424, 1435.
ANALYSIS
According to the declaration of Ryan Davis, after
personal service on its agent, Devion did not respond to the deposition subpoena
for production of business records or to Plaintiffs’ meet-and-confer efforts. Nor
did Devion file any opposition to the properly served motion.
Therefore, the Court will order Devion to comply with
the subpoena attached to the declaration as exhibit 1, albeit with an updated date
of compliance.
CONCLUSION
The Court grants the unopposed motion, as prayed. 
On or before 6/28/24, deponent Devion shall comply
with the deposition subpoena that is attached to the declaration of Ryan Davis as
exhibit 1, as modified hereby with regard to the extended date.
Additionally, on or before that same date, Devion shall
pay discovery sanctions in the sum of $918.00 to Plaintiffs, the Court finding
the absence of substantial justification. E.g., Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030.
