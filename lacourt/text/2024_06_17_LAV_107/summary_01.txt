And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for default judgment. The plaintiff, Virtue Recovery Center, LLC, failed to provide a summary of the case and did not adequately support their claims with evidence. The judge also found that the calculation of damages was incorrect. The plaintiff's manager submitted an affidavit, but it did not attach any exhibits to support the claims. The judge cited California Code of Civil Procedure section 585, subdivision (b), which permits the court to render judgment in favor of the plaintiff only if it appears that the judgment is just. The judge has ordered that the request for default judgment be denied.
