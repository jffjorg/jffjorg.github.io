COURT’S [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
 



[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]:
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
 
I. BACKGROUND
On
January 29, 2022, Patricia Ann Broncucia (“Patricia Ann”), the mother of
plaintiff Shellee Ann Broncucia (“Shellee Ann”) and Terry Broncucia (“Terry”)
and the wife of plaintiff Joseph Broncucia (“Joseph” and, together with Shellee
Ann and Terry, “Plaintiffs”), was admitted to a hospital operated by defendant
West Hills Hospital & Medical Center (“Defendant”). (Complaint Addendum p.
1.) She was accompanied by her daughter, Shellee Ann, who is also her caretaker.
(Ibid.) The following day, Patricia Ann passed away at Defendant’s
hospital. (Ibid.)
 
On
January 26, 2024, Plaintiffs initiated this lawsuit by filing a complaint (the
“Complaint”) alleging causes of action for (1) wrongful death, (2) medical
negligence, and (3) loss of consortium.
 
On
April 10, 2024, Defendant filed a demurrer (the “Demurrer”) to the Complaint.
On June 3, 2024, Plaintiffs opposed the Demurrer, and on June 10, 2024,
Defendant replied to Plaintiffs’ opposition.
 
II. PROCEDURAL
MATTERS
 
A.   
Timeliness
of Filings
 
Per
California Code of Civil Procedure §¿430.40, subdivision (a), a demurrer to a
complaint should be filed within 30 days after service of the complaint. “If the parties are not able to meet and confer at least
five days prior to the date the responsive pleading is due, the demurring party
shall be granted an automatic 30-day extension of time within which to file a
responsive pleading, by filing and serving, on or before the date on which a
demurrer would be due, a declaration stating under penalty of perjury that a
good faith attempt to meet and confer was made and explaining the reasons why
the parties could not meet and confer.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §¿430.41(a)(2).)
¿¿¿¿ 
Per
California Code of Civil Procedure §¿1005, subdivision (b), moving papers
should be filed at least 16 court days before they are set for hearing,
oppositions thereto should be filed at least nine court days before the set
hearing, and replies to any oppositions should be filed at least five court
days before the set hearing. Judges have discretion as to whether to consider
or strike an untimely demurrer or pleading. (McAllister v. County of
Monterey (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 253, 281; Tuck v. Thuesen (1970) 10
Cal.App.3d 193, 196 (disapproved on other grounds by Neel v. Magana, Olney,
Levy, Cathcart & Gelfand (1971) 6 Cal.3d 176).)¿¿ 
 
On March 13,
2024, Defendant’s counsel filed a declaration under California Code of Civil
Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a)(2) indicating that Defendant was
served with the Complaint on February 13, 2024. (McColgan Decl. ¶ 2.)
Plaintiffs filed a proof of service indicating that Defendant was personally
served with just the summons on March 20, 2024. (Proof of Service p. 1.)
Defendant’s counsel’s declaration adequately shows that meet and confer efforts
were made and is timely filed, so the filing deadline for the Demurrer was
extended by 30 days to April 12, 2024. 
 
We are
satisfied that all filings made in connection with the Demurrer were timely
made.
 
B.   
The Meet
& Confer Requirement
 
California
Code of Civil Procedure §¿430.41, subdivision (a) requires parties to “meet and
confer” in good faith before the filing of a demurrer to attempt to informally
resolve the objections raised in the demurrer.¿The demurring party is required
to file and serve with the demurrer a declaration either confirming that
parties were unable to resolve the issues raised by the demurrer despite having
met and conferred or that the opposing party failed to meet and confer with the
demurring party in good faith. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §¿430.41, subd. (a)(3).)
 
Defendant filed with the complaint a declaration by
its counsel indicating that parties met and conferred before the filing of the
Demurrer but were unable to resolve the issues raised thereby. (McColgan Decl.
¶¶ 10–11.)
 
III. DISCUSSION
 
Defendant
demurs to the first two causes of action on the grounds that they “rely on the
same facts and involve the same primary right… violating the rule that a
plaintiff is entitled to a single recovery for ‘each item of compensable damage’
despite the number or nature of legal theories alleged” and on the grounds that
each is time barred by the statute of limitations. (Notice of Demurrer p. 2.)
 
As a
general matter, in a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the
face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice.¿(Donabedian v. Mercury
Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)¿“A demurrer tests the pleading
alone, and not the evidence or facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants,
Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such, the court assumes
the truth of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Ibid.)
The only issue a demurrer is concerned with is whether the complaint, as it
stands, states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)¿A complaint is sufficient if it contains
“[a]¿statement¿of the¿facts¿constituting the cause of action, in ordinary and
concise language.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §¿425.10(a)(1).) Under this standard,
a “complaint ordinarily is sufficient if it alleges ultimate rather than
evidentiary facts.” (Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531,
550.)¿¿ 
 
A.    Duplicative
Causes of Action
 
A
demurrer may be sustained on the basis that a cause of action duplicates
another and “add[s] nothing… by way of fact or theory of recovery.” (Palm
Springs Villas II Homeowners Assn., Inc. v. Parth (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th
268, 290.) “To define a cause of action, California follows
the primary right theory.” (Consumer Advocacy Group, Inc. v.
ExxonMobil Corp. (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 675, 686.) “The most salient
characteristic of a primary right is that it is indivisible: the
violation of a single primary right gives rise to but a single
cause of action.” (Ibid.) “If one needs a quick handle on the test, the
core concept is harm suffered.” (Friedman Prof. Management Co., Inc. v.
Norcal Mutual Ins. Co. (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 17, 28.) If two causes of
action “were part of the same transaction, but gave rise to different harms,”
then they are not duplicative of each other. (Id. at 29.) In Quiroz
v. Seventh Ave. Center, causes of action for negligence and wrongful death
were held to plead different injuries. ((2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1256, 1278–79.)
 
Following
Quiroz v. Seventh Ave. Center, supra, 140 Cal.App.4th 1256 at
1278–79, the causes of action for wrongful death and medical negligence plead
different injuries and have different primary rights. For the medical
negligence cause of action, the “harm stem[s] from the violation of
the right to be free of negligence in connection with the
[medical care].” (Friedman Prof. Management Co., Inc. v. Norcal Mutual Ins.
Co., supra, 120 Cal.App.4th 17 at 29.) This harm has a greater scope
than that of wrongful death, even though both harms arose from the same facts.
 
Therefore,
we do not sustain the Demurrer on the grounds that the first two causes of
action are duplicative.
 
B.    Statute
of Limitations
 
“‘Statute
of limitations’ is the collective term applied to acts or parts of acts that
prescribe the periods beyond which a plaintiff may not bring a cause of action.”
(Fox v. Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. (2005) 35 Cal.4th 797, 806.) “A complaint showing on its face the cause of action is
barred by the¿statute¿of¿limitations¿is subject to general demurrer.” (Iverson,
Yoakum, Papiano & Hatch v. Berwald (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 990, 995.)
 
We
agree with Defendant that the Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act of 1975
(“MICRA”) applies to the Complaint’s first two causes of action for medical
negligence and wrongful death occurring at Defendant’s hospital under the care
of Defendant’s healthcare providers. (Demurrer pp. 9–10.) MICRA includes California
Code of Civil Procedure section¿340.5, which applies “[i]n an action for injury
or death against a health care provider based upon such person’s alleged
professional negligence” and sets the statute of limitations at “three years
after the date of injury or one year after the plaintiff discovers, or through
the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered the injury, whichever
occurs first.” 
 
Plaintiffs
do not argue and the allegations of the Complaint do not show that there was
any delay in their discovery of the injuries alleged by the Complaint. Rather,
the Complaint indicates that Shellee Ann was informed of the circumstances of
her mother’s medical care and death on the same day that Patricia Ann passed
away. (Complaint Addendum p. 1.)
 
“As
a usual matter, the date of accrual of a cause of action for wrongful death is
the date of death.” (Quiroz v. Seventh Ave. Center, supra, 140
Cal.App.4th 1256 at 1277, fn. 26.) The Complaint alleges that Patricia Ann
passed away on January 30, 2022 (Complaint Addendum p. 1), a few days shy of
two years before the Complaint was filed. Therefore, the first cause of action
for wrongful death is untimely.
 
All
of the alleged medical negligence, as Defendant points out in the Demurrer,
occurred between January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2022. (Demurrer p. 9.) Thus,
the alleged medical negligence occurred almost two years before the Complaint
was filed on January 26, 2024. Therefore, the second cause of action for
medical negligence is similarly untimely.
 
Accordingly,
this court SUSTAINS the Demurrer.
 
C.    Leave
to Amend
 
Where
a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be allowed where there is a
reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy
(1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) “If there is any reasonable possibility that the
plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer
without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist. (1969) 70
Cal.2d 240, 245.) “If the plaintiff has not had an opportunity to amend the
complaint in response to the demurrer, leave to amend is liberally allowed as a
matter of fairness, unless the complaint shows on its face that it is incapable
of amendment.” (City of Stockton v. Superior Court (2007) 42 Cal.4th
730, 747.) Courts generally allow at least one time to amend a complaint, after
sustaining a demurrer, even without any request for leave to amend. (McDonald
v. Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal. App. 3d 297, 303.)
 
While
this is the first time a demurrer has been sustained against the Complaint, we
do not see any reasonable possibility that the tolling of the statute of
limitations can be cured by amendment. This court therefore does not grant
leave to amend.
