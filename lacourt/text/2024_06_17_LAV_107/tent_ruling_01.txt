COURT’S [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: REQUEST
  FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 



[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]:
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
The
Request for Default Judgment is Denied.
Reasons
 

As the court explained months
     ago when the court denied the request for default judgment, a Summary of
     the case identifying parties and the nature of the action is missing.
     Plaintiff must submit a summary of the case.
The calculation of the amount
     for which defendants are liable to plaintiff on the JUD-100 proposed
     judgment is incorrect. $160,000 and $526.70 total to $160,526.70, not
     $171,726.70.
The amount sought is not
     adequately supported by evidence. California Code of Civil Procedure
     section 585, subdivision (b) permits the court to render judgment in
     plaintiff’s favor only “as appears by the evidence to be just.”
     Here, Plaintiff’s only piece of evidence is an affidavit by its manager,
     which does not attach any exhibits. Although Plaintiff’s manager states in
     the declaration that the corporate defendants are the alter egos of the
     natural person defendant, no supporting evidence is provided. And,
     Plaintiff claims $152,550 in damages for lost revenues, but no other
     evidence supporting this figure is provided.

 
 
The
Request for Default Judgment is therefore Denied. It is so ordered.
