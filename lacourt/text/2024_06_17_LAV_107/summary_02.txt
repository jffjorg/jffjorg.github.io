Here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrer filed by the defendant, West Hills Hospital & Medical Center, and has sustained the demurrer. The court finds that the plaintiff's causes of action for wrongful death and medical negligence are not duplicative and are time-barred under the Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act of 1975 (MICRA). The court does not grant leave to amend the complaint, as there is no reasonable possibility of successful amendment. The court also finds that the plaintiff's causes of action are untimely under MICRA, as they were filed more than two years after the alleged injuries occurred.
