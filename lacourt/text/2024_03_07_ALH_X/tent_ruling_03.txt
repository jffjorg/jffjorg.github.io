LEGAL STANDARD
 
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely
response, the party propounding the interrogatories may move for an order
compelling a response to the interrogatories. (Code Civ. Proc. section
2030.290, subd. (b).) The same applies to a party that fails to respond to a
request for document production. (Code Civ. Proc. section 2031.300, subd. (b).)
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (b), provides that
if a party fails to respond to a request for admission, “[t]he requesting party
may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of
any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted”.
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Defendant moves for an order compelling a response to his discovery
requests. Defendant provides that he separately served Plaintiffs with form
interrogatories, special interrogatories, requests for the production of
documents, and requests for admission on July 21, 2023. (Sargsyan Decl. ¶ 3.) Defendant provides that Plaintiffs have
failed to provide discovery responses. (Id. ¶ 7.) Defendant has
demonstrated that he has served discovery responses but that Plaintiffs have
failed to provide responses. Defendant’s motions to compel discovery responses are
granted. Defendant’s motions to deem admitted are granted. 
 
            Defendant also seeks sanctions for each of his eight
motions. Defendant seeks a total of $561.65 for each of his eight motions. Code
of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (c), provides, in part: “It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary . . . on the party or attorney, or both, whose
failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this
motion.” Defendant’s requests for sanctions is granted for a total of $993.2 –
two hours total for the two motions to deem admitted plus eight counts of the
filing fee of $61.65. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendant’s motions to compel a
response to his discovery requests are GRANTED.
 
Plaintiffs are ordered to provide
code-complaint responses without objections within 20 days of the date of this
order to Defendant’s form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and
requests for the production of documents. 
 
            Defendant’s
