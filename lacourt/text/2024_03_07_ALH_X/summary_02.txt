Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The defendant, Ford Motor Company, had argued that the plaintiffs, Adrianna Trujillo and George Narvaez, had not made sufficient attempts to fix the defects in their 2022 Ford Bronco. The court found that the defendant had not met its burden of showing that the plaintiffs were unable to establish their claims.

The court also found that the plaintiffs had presented sufficient evidence to establish their claims for breach of express warranty and breach of implied warranty. The defendant had argued that the plaintiffs had failed to timely revoke their acceptance of the contract, but the court found that this was not an essential element of their claim.

The court also denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment as to the plaintiffs' third cause of action, which alleged a violation of the Song-Beverly Act. The defendant had argued that the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate revocation and damages, but the court found that the defendant's arguments were based on its position that the plaintiffs' first cause of action failed, which was not supported by the evidence.

The court will allow the plaintiffs to proceed with their claims, and the defendant will have the opportunity to respond to the plaintiffs' opposition and reply briefs.
