And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies Defendants' motion for summary judgment and grants their motion for summary adjudication in part. The Court finds that Plaintiff's claim for rescission of the retainer agreement and invalidation of the contingency fee provision has merit, but that Plaintiff cannot establish a claim for fraud or fraudulent concealment. The Court finds that Defendants did disclose the total amount of attorney's fees recovered, but that the disclosure was somewhat obfuscated. As a result, the element of misrepresentation or concealment of a material fact for the fraud and fraudulent concealment causes of action cannot be established. The Court grants summary adjudication in favor of Defendants on the first and second causes of action, and concludes that Plaintiff's remedy lies in rescission of the retainer agreement and invalidation of the contingency fee provision.
