And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Cohen v. Kaplan, Case No. 20SMCV01214. The case involves a dispute over a settlement agreement and allegations of fraud, negligence, and breach of fiduciary duty. The court has granted the cross-defendants' motion to strike punitive damages and prejudgment interest from the fourth amended cross-complaint (FACC) as to Sotheby's International Realty Affiliates, LLC and Sotheby's International Realty, Inc., as the court has previously ruled that punitive damages are not allowable as to Sotheby's. The court has also struck the prayer for prejudgment interest from the FACC. In addition, the court has overruled Elaine Cohen's demurrer to the third COA of the FACC, finding that the allegations of breach of settlement agreement are sufficient to survive demurrer. The court has also denied the demurrer filed by Elaine Cohen, finding that the allegations of breach of settlement agreement are sufficient to state a claim.
