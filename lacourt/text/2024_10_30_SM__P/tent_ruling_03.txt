Gursey Schneider, LLP v. Aslin,
Case no. 24SMCP00418
Hearing date October 30, 2024
Plaintiff
Gursey Schneider’s Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award
Defendant
retained plaintiff to perform accounting services regarding defendant's
dissolution of marriage proceedings. Plaintiff and defendant executed a
litigation consulting services engagement agreement which contained a binding
arbitration provision. Plaintiff subsequently initiated arbitration proceedings
for unpaid accounting services. The arbitrator awarded plaintiff $21,004.86
plus interest on 9/20/2023. Defendant subsequently failed to make payments as
agreed. Plaintiff now petitions for confirmation of the arbitration award and
seeks costs. Defendant is in pro per and does not oppose the petition.
“Any
party to an arbitration in which an award has been made may petition the court
to confirm, correct or vacate the award.” Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §1285. “If a
petition or response under this chapter is duly served and filed, the court
shall confirm the award as made.” Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §1286.
Plaintiff
seeks to have the court confirm an award of $21,004.86 plus interest pursuant
to AAA Consumer Rules 44(a), accruing since 9/21/2023 at 10% per annum. Decl.
Kramer para. 5. Defendant has made no payments on the arbitration award. Decl.
Kramer para. 6. Plaintiff served and filed the petition 8/2/2024. Confirmation
of the award is appropriate.
Plaintiff
seeks 5 hours of attorney’s fees at $395/hour for preparing the petition and
declarations, meetings on such, and the proposed order. Plaintiff anticipates
an additional 3 hours attending hearings on the petition. Plaintiff seeks $370
in costs. The court awards 5 hours for preparation of the moving papers. Three
hours to attend an uncontested petition is excessive. The court awards one hour
for attending the hearing, a total of 6 hours at $395/hour, plus $370 in costs.
GRANTED, attorney’s fees and costs awarded as modified. Plaintiff to prepare a
proposed order.
