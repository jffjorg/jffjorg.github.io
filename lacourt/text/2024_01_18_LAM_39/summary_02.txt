Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Executive Presentations, Inc. v. Maro Burunsuzyan, et al. The plaintiff is seeking to compel Maro Burunsuzyan to serve responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One (FROG). The judge finds that the motion is moot except with respect to sanctions. The judge denies the motion as moot and grants the plaintiff's request for sanctions. The judge is concerned about potential duplication in sanctions and will determine the amount of sanctions when it decides the remaining discovery motions. The judge also advances and continues the plaintiff's motion to deem admitted and orders the parties to meet-and-confer concerning the pending discovery motions, sanctions amounts, and potential settlement of the case.
