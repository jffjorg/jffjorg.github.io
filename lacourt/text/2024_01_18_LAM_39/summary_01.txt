And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is regarding a motion to vacate an order compelling arbitration in a wrongful termination case. The Plaintiff, John Doe, filed a lawsuit against OptumCare Management, LLC, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated, Maria Orozco, and Veronica Ramirez. The Court previously granted the motion to compel arbitration and ordered the case to proceed through arbitration. However, the Plaintiff's counsel failed to provide proof of payment of the $25 administrative fee to initiate the arbitration, despite representing that he did so. The Court has ordered the Plaintiff's counsel to file a supplemental declaration with proof of payment by January 23, 2024, and has continued the hearing to February 2, 2024. If the Plaintiff's counsel fails to provide the required information, the Court will assume that the Plaintiff did not pay the required fee.
