Presentations, Inc. v. Maro Burunsuzyan, et al.
Case No.
23STLC02420
Motion to Compel
Responses to FROG
 
            Plaintiff
Executive Presentations, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Maro
Burunsuzyan, Esq.  Plaintiff moves to
compel Maro Burunsuzyan to serve responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One
(“FROG”).    
            
Plaintiff filed this action on
April 12, 2023.  Ms. Burunsuzyan filed an
answer stating that she is represented by Steven A. Velkei and herself.  Mr. Velkei listed his email address as: SVelkei@VelkeiLaw.com.  Plaintiff’s counsel served the FROG on August
10, 2023, by emailing them to Ms. Burunsuzyan and Mr. Velkei.  (See Declaration of Steven J. Revitz, ¶ 9
& Exh. #1.)  Plaintiff’s counsel sent
the FROG to: (1) AttorneyMaro@yahoo.com; and (2) SVelkei@VelkeiLaw.com.  (Id., ¶ 9 & Exh. #1.)  This motion was filed on November 20, 2023,
and Ms. Burunsunzyan served verified responses without objections on January 4,
2024.  Therefore, the motion is moot
except with respect to sanctions.
 
Ms. Burunsuzyan argues that service
was not effective because the FROG were emailed to AttorneyMaro@yahoo.com
instead of Support@MaroLaw.com.  Ms.
Burunsuzyan argues that Plaintiff’s counsel did not confirm the correct email
address, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6(b)(3).  The Court is not persuaded by this argument
for several reasons.  As an initial
matter, the FROG were served on Mr. Velkei at the email address listed on his
answer and other pleadings, and he was counsel-of-record until October 2, 2023,
i.e., when the FROG were served and when the responses were due.  If Mr. Velkei failed to respond to the FROG, that
is an issue between him and Ms. Burunsuzyan. 
Moreover, Ms. Burunsuzyan created her own problem because she failed to
list her email address on any pleading in this case, as required by California
Rules of Court, rule 2.111.  She and her
co-counsel also routinely used AttorneyMaro@yahoo.com in this case.  Ms. Burunsuzyan sent email from AttorneyMaro@yahoo.com
to Plaintiff’s counsel on multiple occasions. 
(See Declaration of Steven J. Revitz, ¶ 10 & Exhs. 4-7.)  This is sufficient confirmation for purposes
of section 1010.6(b)(3) and casts doubt on Ms. Burunsuzyan’s claim that she
uses this email address for personal matters. 
The Court notes that Ms. Burunsuzyan’s co-counsel served her at
AttorneyMaro@yahoo.com, too.  (Id., ¶ 11
& Exh. 8.)   
 
Based upon the foregoing, the Court
orders as follows:
 
1.         The
Court denies the motion as moot.
 
2.         The
Court grants Plaintiff’s request for sanctions. 
However, the Court is concerned by potential duplication in sanctions
given that there are three other motions raising similar issues.  Therefore, the Court shall determine the
amount of the sanctions when it decides the remaining discovery motions (on
March 5, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.) 
 
3.         The
Court advances and continues Plaintiff’s motion to deem admitted from January
25, 2024, to March 5, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
 
4.         The
Court advances Plaintiff’s remaining motions to compel from April 4 and April
17, 2024, to March 5, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. 
 
5.         The
Court orders the parties to meet-and-confer concerning the pending discovery
motions, sanctions amounts, and potential settlement of the case.  The parties shall file a joint statement on
or before February 2, 2024, informing the Court whether it has reached any
resolution concerning the pending discovery motions, sanctions amounts, and any
settlement of the case.  If the parties
cannot resolve the issues, oppositions and reply briefs shall be due based upon
statutory deadlines.
 
6.         The
Court’s clerk shall provide notice.
