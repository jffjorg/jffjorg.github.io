ANALYSIS:
 
III.    
Requests
for Judicial Notice
 
Bow Tie and United request that the Court take judicial notice of:
 
(1)      
The
Court of Appeal Docket in Appeal No. B322901; and
 
(2)      
The
Remittitur in Appeal No. B322901.
 
The Court GRANTS judicial notice of these items. 
 
IV.     
Legal
Standard
 
“Except as otherwise expressly provided by statute, a
prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any
action or proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (b).)
 
“‘Prevailing party’ includes the party with a net monetary
recovery, a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered, a defendant where
neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief, and a defendant as against
those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against that defendant. If any
party recovers other than monetary relief and in situations other than as
specified, the ‘prevailing party’ shall be as determined by the court, and
under those circumstances, the court, in its discretion, may allow costs or not
and, if allowed, may apportion costs between the parties on the same or adverse
sides pursuant to rules adopted under Section 1034.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032,
subd. (a)(4).)
 
Attorneys’ fees are allowed as costs when authorized by
contract, statute, or law. (Code Civ. Proc, § 1033.5, subd. (a)(10)(B).)
 
V.        
Discussion
 
Bow Tie and United move the Court to
award $21,412.50 in attorney’s fees for Appeal No. B322901. (Motion for Fees re
Lee VI, p. 5:20–25.) Bow Tie and United have also submitted a Memorandum
of Costs that indicates their costs on this appeal were $570.65. (APP-013.)
 
The Motion for Fees re Lee VI
is unopposed. 
 
The Court agrees with Bow Tie and
United that their motions are timely, that they are entitled to their
attorney’s fees on appeal, that their costs claimed are reasonable, and that
the hourly rate of $750.00 is reasonable. 
 
However, given that many of the past
filings in this matter have, mutatis mutandis, been identical — whether
they be motions for attorney’s fees, filings on appeal, and so on — it has now
become unreasonable for United’s and Bow Tie’s Counsel to claim that 28.45
hours were spent on this matter. Moreover, this motion is essentially identical
to multiple motions previously filed in this matter. A reasonable attorney
would not have spent more than five hours of work on this motion. 
 
 
The Court will award attorney’s fees
and costs in the total amount of $4,320.65. This is calculated as five hours of
work at $750.00 per hour, plus the costs of $570.65.  
 
VI.      Conclusion
 
The Motion for Fees re Lee VI is GRANTED. Attorney’s fees and
costs are awarded in favor of Bow Tie and United, jointly and severally, and
against Plaintiff in the total amount of $4,320.65.
