The Motion is DENIED without
prejudice.  The Court reminds counsel that

BACKGROUND:
 
        On July 12, 2022, Plaintiff filed her
Complaint against Defendant Alta Public Schools on causes of action arising
from Plaintiff’s employment with Defendant. 
 
        On September 21, 2022, Plaintiff filed her
First Amended Complaint.
 
        On January 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed her
Second Amended Complaint (SAC).
 
        On February 14, 2023, Plaintiff filed
her Notice of Errata regarding her SAC.
 
        On March 2, 2023, Defendant filed its
Answer to Plaintiff’s SAC.
 
        On June 9, 2023, Defendant filed its
First Amended Answer to Plaintiff’s SAC.
 
        On October 12, 2023, Plaintiff filed her
Motion for Approval of PAGA Settlement. In support of her Motion, Plaintiff
concurrently filed: (1) Declaration of Matthew Gutierrez; (2) Request for
Judicial Notice; and (3) Proposed Order. 
 
        No opposition or other response has been
filed to the Motion. 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Request for Judicial Notice
 
Plaintiff requests
that the Court take judicial notice of: 
 
(1)       Legislative Counsel
Digest re Senate Bill 796;
 
(2)       Legislative Counsel
Digest re Senate Bill 1809; and
 
(3)       Letter from Senator
Joseph Dunn, published in the Senate Daily Journal dated July 29, 2004.
 
The Court DENIES as irrelevant judicial notice to
each of these items. “Although a court may judicially notice a variety of
matters (Evid. Code, § 450 et seq.), only relevant material may be
noticed.” (Am. Cemwood Corp. v. Am. Home Assurance Co. (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th
431, 441, fn. 7, quotation omitted, italics in original.)
 
II.       Legal Standard
 
“This part shall
be known and may be cited as the Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act of
2004.” (Lab. Code, § 2698.)
 
“Notwithstanding
any other provision of law, any provision of this code that provides for a
civil penalty to be assessed and collected by the Labor and Workforce
Development Agency or any of its departments, divisions, commissions, boards,
agencies, or employees, for a violation of this code, may, as an alternative,
be recovered through a civil action brought by an aggrieved employee on behalf
of himself or herself and other current or former employees pursuant to the
procedures specified in Section 2699.3.” (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (a).)
 
In bringing an action pursuant to the Labor
Code Private Attorneys General Act of (2004) (“PAGA”), “the aggrieved employee
acts as the proxy or agent of state labor law enforcement agencies,
representing the same legal right and interest of those agencies, in a proceeding
that is designed to protect the public, not to benefit private parties.” (Amalgamated
Transit Union, Local 1756, AFL-CIO v. Super. Ct. (2009) 46 Cal.4th 993,
1003, citations omitted.)
 
        PAGA claims, as well as
settlements of PAGA claims, involve multiple statutory requirements. (Lab.
Code, § 2699, et seq.)
 
III.    
Discussion
 
The Court considers below the various
statutory requirements of PAGA, as well as whether the settlement meets the
fair, reasonable, and adequate standard.

Proof of Service on the Labor and Workforce
Development Agency Prior to Commencement of Action, at Commencement of Action,
and Prior to Settlement of Action
 
1.         
Legal Standard
 
“A civil action by an aggrieved employee pursuant to subdivision
(a) or (f) of Section 2699 alleging a violation of any provision listed in
Section 2699.5 shall commence only after the following requirements have been
met:
 
“(1)
 
“(A) The aggrieved employee or representative shall
give written notice by online filing with the Labor and Workforce Development
Agency and by certified mail to the employer of the specific provisions of this
code alleged to have been violated, including the facts and theories to support
the alleged violation.
 
“(B) A notice filed with the Labor and Workforce
Development Agency pursuant to subparagraph (A) and any employer response to
that notice shall be accompanied by a filing fee of seventy-five dollars ($75).
The fees required by this subparagraph are subject to waiver in accordance with
the requirements of Sections 68632 and 68633 of the Government Code.”
 
(Lab. Code, §
2699.3, subd. (a)(1)(A)–(B).)
 
“The provisions
of subdivision (a) of Section 2699.3 apply to any alleged violation of the
following provisions: subdivision (k) of Section 96, Sections 98.6, 201, 201.3,
201.5, 201.7, 202, 203, 203.1, 203.5, 204, 204a, 204b, 204.1, 204.2, 205,

1199, 1199.5, 1290, 1292, 1293, 1293.1, 1294, 1294.1, 1294.5, 1296, 1297, 1298,
1301, 1308, 1308.1, 1308.7, 1309, 1309.5, 1391, 1391.1, 1391.2, 1392, 1683, and

2802, 2806, and 2810, subdivision (b) of Section 2929, and Sections 3073.6,
6310, 6311, and 6399.7.” (Lab. Code, § 2699.5.)
 
“For cases filed
on or after July 1, 2016, the aggrieved employee or representative shall,
within 10 days following commencement of a civil action pursuant to this part,
provide the Labor and Workforce Development Agency with a file-stamped copy of
the complaint that includes the case number assigned by the court.” (Lab. Code,
§ 2699, subd. (l)(1).)
 
“The superior
court shall review and approve any settlement of any civil action filed
pursuant to this part. The proposed settlement shall be submitted to the agency
at the same time that it is submitted to the court.” (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd.
(l)(2).)
 
2.         
Discussion
 
Plaintiff filed causes of action for various
labor code violations, including violations of Labor Code sections 203, 226.7,
and 510. These sections are covered by Labor Code section 2699.5, and thus the
pre-complaint notice requirement to the Labor Workforce Development Agency
(LWDA) applies here. (Lab. Code, § 2699.3, subd. (a).)
 
Plaintiff provided the Court with evidence
that Plaintiff sent a notice letter to LWDA on July 14, 2022. (Decl. Gutierrez,
Exh. C.) The Court finds that this meets the notice requirement under Labor
Code section 2699.3, subdivision (a).
 
Plaintiff has not provided the Court with
evidence that a file-stamped copy of the complaint with the case number
assigned by the Court was sent to the Labor Workforce Development Agency (LWDA)
within 10 days following commencement of this civil action. (Lab. Code, § 2699,
subd. (l)(1).) The Court must have such evidence before allowing the settlement
to proceed. 
 
Plaintiff provided email evidence of
submission of a copy of the proposed settlement to LWDA at the same time that
it submitted the proposed settlement to the Court. (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd.
(l)(2); Decl. Gutierrez Exh. D.) The Court finds that this meets the notice
requirement under Labor Code section 2699, subdivision (l)(2).
 
B.         
The PAGA Settlement
 
1.         
Legal Standard
 
“For all provisions of this code except those for which a civil
penalty is specifically provided, there is established a civil penalty for a
violation of these provisions, as follows: . . . (2) If, at the time of the
alleged violation, the person employs one or more employees, the civil penalty
is one hundred dollars ($100) for each aggrieved employee per pay period for
the initial violation and two hundred dollars ($200) for each aggrieved
employee per pay period for each subsequent violation.” (Lab. Code, § 2699,
subd. (f)(2).)
 
“For purposes of
this part, whenever the Labor and Workforce Development Agency, or any of its
departments, divisions, commissions, boards, agencies, or employees, has
discretion to assess a civil penalty, a court is authorized to exercise the
same discretion, subject to the same limitations and conditions, to assess a
civil penalty.” (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (e)(1).)
 
“In any action by
an aggrieved employee seeking recovery of a civil penalty available under
subdivision (a) or (f), a court may award a lesser amount than the maximum
civil penalty amount specified by this part if, based on the facts and
circumstances of the particular case, to do otherwise would result in an award
that is unjust, arbitrary and oppressive, or confiscatory.” (Lab. Code, § 2699,
subd. (e)(2).)
 
“Except as
provided in subdivision (j), civil penalties recovered by aggrieved employees
shall be distributed as follows: 75 percent to the Labor and Workforce
Development Agency for enforcement of labor laws, including the administration
of this part, and for education of employers and employees about their rights
and responsibilities under this code, to be continuously appropriated to
supplement and not supplant the funding to the agency for those purposes; and 25
percent to the aggrieved employees.” (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (i).)
 
“Except as
provided in paragraph (2), an aggrieved employee may recover the civil penalty
described in subdivision (f) in a civil action pursuant to the procedures
specified in Section 2699.3 filed on behalf of himself or herself and other
current or former employees against whom one or more of the alleged violations
was committed. Any employee who prevails in any action shall be entitled to an
award of reasonable attorney’s fees and costs, including any filing fee paid
pursuant to subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) or
subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) of Section 2699.3. Nothing
in this part shall operate to limit an employee’s right to pursue or recover
other remedies available under state or federal law, either separately or
concurrently with an action taken under this part.” (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd.
(g)(1).)

Highlights of the Proposed PAGA Settlement
 
Among other things, the following are the
highlights of the proposed PAGA settlement:
 
(1)       Defendant will pay
a gross settlement amount of $40,000.00 (the “Gross Settlement Amount”). 
 
(2)       PAGA Counsel (who
are Plaintiff’s Counsel) will be paid up to 33.33% of the Gross Settlement
Amount (which would be $13,333.33, although the currently estimated amount is
expected to be $11,665.50, or approximately 29.16% of the Gross Settlement
Amount), plus up to $1,000.00 in costs (the “Costs”), which is an additional
2.5% of the Gross Settlement Amount.
 
(3)       Phoenix Settlement
Administrators (the “PAGA Administrator”) will be paid up to $2,950.00, except
for a showing of good cause and as approved by the Court. This is 7.375% of the
Gross Settlement Amount. 
 
(4)       LWDA and the
Aggrieved Employees (including Plaintiff, who will be receiving her pro rata
share of the PAGA penalties) will receive 75% and 25%, respectively, of the
remaining $19,384.50.
 
(5)       Plaintiff has a
separate agreement with Defendant for settlement of her non-PAGA claims. 
 
(6)       There are estimated
to be 99 Aggrieved Employees who worked a total of 2,956 of PAGA-relevant pay
periods. The Aggrieved Employees will receive payments from the PAGA
Administrator based on a division of the employee share of the PAGA penalties
that is multiplied by each employee’s number of PAGA-relevant pay periods. 
 
(7)       Aggrieved Employees
will have up to 180 days to cash their settlement checks, after which those
checks will be voided, and the funds represented by such checks will be sent to
the Monarch School, a non-profit organization that cares for homeless children.
Defendant has agreed not to receive any reversion from the Gross Settlement
Amount. 
 
(Decl. Gutierrez, Exh. A.)
 
        The proposed PAGA settlement
also includes other terms, such as for distribution of the settlement and
release from claims. (Ibid.)
 
3.         
Attorneys’ Fees and Attorneys’ Costs
 
PAGA Counsel requests $11,665.50 in
attorneys’ fees, which is approximately 29.16% of the Gross Settlement Amount.
PAGA Counsel further requests $1,000.00 in costs, which is an additional 2.5%
of the Gross Settlement Amount. 
 
The Court finds that these amounts of fees
and costs are reasonable. 
 
4.         
PAGA Administrator Costs
 
PAGA Counsel requests that the PAGA
Administrator be paid up to $2,950.00 (which is 7.375% of the Gross Settlement
Amount) for expenses incurred in administering the settlement.
 
PAGA Counsel has not provided the Court with
any information as to how this amount was estimated. Without this information,
the Court cannot determine if spending $29.80 per person in administrative fees
is reasonable.
 
Although the Court finds it appropriate that
the agreement contains a provision in which any unused portion of this amount
would go to LWDA and Aggrieved Employees in their proportionate amounts, the
Court requests additional information on the PAGA Administrator’s expected
costs. 
 
5.         
Remaining Civil Penalties for LWDA and Aggrieved
Employees
 
PAGA Counsel requests that LWDA and the
Aggrieved Employees receive 75% and 25%, respectively, of the “Net Settlement
Amount (i.e., the Gross Settlement Amount, less the Attorneys’ Fees, Attorneys’
Costs, and PAGA Administrator Costs). 
 
This division of the civil penalties is
required pursuant to Labor Code section 2699, subdivision i.
 
PAGA Counsel claim that the Net Settlement
Amount is estimated to be $19,384.50. The Court does not understand where this
figure comes from. Given the other figures listed above, the Net Settlement
Amount should be $24,384.50, which is $5,000.00 larger than the amount
estimated about PAGA Counsel. 
 
A division of $18,288.38 to LWDA (i.e., 75%
of $24,384.50), and $6,096.12 (i.e., 25% of $24,384.50) would be appropriate,
with any further savings from the PAGA Administrator’s Costs being split
similarly. 
 
6.         
Reversion of Funds
 
The settlement agreement gives Aggrieved
Employees up to 180 days to cash their settlement checks, after which those
checks will be voided. Further, the funds represented by such checks will be
sent to the Monarch School, a non-profit organization that cares for homeless
children.
 
The settlement agreement cites Code of Civil
Procedure section 384 as the source of authority for this proposed reversion,
although the Motion admits that Code of Civil Procedure section 384 only
applies to class actions. (Decl. Gutierrez, Exh. A, § 4.4.4; Motion, p.
10:11–16.)
 
While class actions and PAGA cases have
similarities, they are not the same. Plaintiff correctly notes that Code of
Civil Procedure section 384 only applies to class actions, not PAGA. Although
the Court is sympathetic to the proposition of reverting unused funds to
children who are homeless or previously homeless, the statute clearly requires
that the civil penalties recovered “shall be distributed as follows: 75 percent
to [LWDA] for enforcement of labor laws . . . and 25 percent to the aggrieved
employees.” (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (i).) The Court is not aware of any
statute that would allow the Court to revert the civil penalties collected
under PAGA toward any purpose aside from those listed in the statute. 
 
The Parties should revise this part of the agreement.  One suggestion would be the reversion of any
unclaimed funds to the State of California Unclaimed Property Fund in the
Aggrieved Employee’s names. The revised settlement must clarify in the notice
of PAGA settlement that is sent to employees: (1) the amount of time they have cash
their settlement check; (2) that any checks they do not cash will be void; and
(3) to whom the unclaimed cash will be sent (e.g., the State of California
Unclaimed Property Fund). 
 
7.         
Enhancement Award
 
Under this settlement agreement, Plaintiff
will not be awarded any “bonus” or enhancement award for work done in this
matter. The Court finds that this is acceptable given that Plaintiff apparently
has a separate agreement for settlement of her non-PAGA claims. 
 
8.         
Notice of Release of Claims
 
PAGA Counsel provide a proposed notice to the
Aggrieved Employees. (Decl. Gutierrez, Exh. B.) 
 
The Court is not satisfied with the proposed
notice. The Court would like PAGA Counsel to submit a revised proposed notice,
which should include (with the capitalization, bolded font, and boxed
formatting) the following notice:
 



BY CASHING THIS
  CHECK, YOU ARE NOT GIVING UP ANY RIGHT TO SUE FOR ANY ALLEGED GRIEVANCES THAT
  YOU HAVE AGAINST WHEELS LABS, INC.



 
C.         
The Fair, Reasonable, and Adequate Standard
 
1.         
Legal Standard
 
The Court of Appeal has held “that a trial court should evaluate a PAGA
settlement to determine whether it is fair, reasonable, and adequate in view of
PAGA’s purposes to remediate present labor law violations, deter future ones,
and to maximize enforcement of state labor laws.” (Moniz v. Adecco USA, Inc.
(2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 56, 77, citations omitted.)
 
“Despite the fact
that a representative action under PAGA is not a class action, and is instead a
type of qui tam action, a standard
requiring the trial court to determine independently whether a PAGA settlement
is fair and reasonable is appropriate. . . . Because many of the factors used
to evaluate class action settlements bear on a settlement’s fairness—including
the strength of the plaintiff's case, the risk, the stage of the proceeding,
the complexity and likely duration of further litigation, and the settlement
amount—these factors can be useful in evaluating the fairness of a PAGA
settlement.” (Moniz, supra, at pp. 76–77.)
 
2.         
Discussion
 
Plaintiff’s Counsel provide a detailed
explanation of the Parties’ settlement negotiations, including: (1) the
investigation into the claims; (2) the negotiations between the Parties; and
(3) consideration of Defendant’s finances, based upon a review of sampled
records that indicate Defendant’s ability to pay. (Decl. Gutierrez, ¶¶ 6–8.)
 
The Court would like to receive more details
regarding the settlement. Based on the Court’s calculation, the total amount of
civil penalties could have been upwards of $500,000.00. Yet the settlement
amount is only 8% of that potential figure. Without additional information, the
Court is not yet prepared to find that the fair, reasonable, and adequate
standard has been met here. 
 
II.       
Conclusion
 
The Motion is DENIED without
prejudice.  The Court reminds counsel that
the Court has scheduled an OSC re Dismissal for December 20, 2023, and any proposed
PAGA settlement must be approved prior to that date.
