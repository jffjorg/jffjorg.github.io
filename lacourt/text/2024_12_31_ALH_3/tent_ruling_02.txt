On November 4, 2024, defendant
Caregiver Services & Homecare, Inc. dba 1Heart Caregiver Services
(“Defendant”, erroneously sued as “One Heart Caregivers”) filed this motion for
an order compelling nonparty Verizon Wireless Services, LLC (“Verizon”) to
produce documents in response to a deposition subpoena. The subpoena seeks
Plaintiff’s cell phone records for the month of December 2020 in order to
corroborate her testimony that she reported Defendant’s employee, Rene Borromeo
(“Borromeo”), for touching her “on the hip.” Plaintiff testified that she
contacted both 911 and Defendant on December 9, 2020, to report that Borromeo
touched her “on the hip.” Whether Plaintiff in fact reported this incident to
Defendant is relevant to whether Defendant had notice of Borromeo’s fitness as
an employee because this action is premised on the allegation that Plaintiff
was sexually assaulted by Borromeo on December 15, 2020. 
“The procedure to obtain documents from
a nonparty is through a “records only” or “records and testimony” deposition
subpoena.” (Monarch Healthcare v. Superior Court (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th
1282, 1287.) Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2020.220(c), personal
service of a deposition subpoena “is effective to require . . .[a]ny specific
production, inspection, testing, and sampling” by a deponent. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2020.220, subd. (c).) Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1987.1 (a),
a party may move for an order “directing compliance [with a subpoena] upon
those terms or conditions as the court shall declare.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1987.1, subd. (a).) 
The subpoena was issued to Verizon on September
24, 2024. (Avetisove Decl., ¶ 8.) Plaintiff did not object to the subpoena, but
Verizon sent an objection on October 17, 2024. (Id., Ex. E.) 
Neither Plaintiff nor Verizon opposed
this motion and Defendant has established that the records sought are directly
relevant to the underlying action. Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED and
Verizon is ordered to produce the requested documents within 20 days of the
date of this Order. 
Dated
this 31st
day of December, 2024
