And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel Verizon Wireless Services, LLC to produce documents in response to a deposition subpoena. The subpoena seeks the plaintiff's cell phone records for December 2020 to corroborate her testimony about reporting an alleged touching incident to the defendant's employee, Rene Borromeo. The Judge finds that the subpoena was properly issued and that Verizon has not opposed the motion. Therefore, Verizon is ordered to produce the requested documents within 20 days of the date of the order.
