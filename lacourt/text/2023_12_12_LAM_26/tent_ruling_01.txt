  Case Number:  19STCV26182    Hearing Date:   December 12, 2023    Dept:  26 Plaintiff’s counsel, E. Jay Gotfredson (“Counsel”),
moves to be relieved as counsel of record for Plaintiff Bianca Alexis Fairchild
(“Client”).  Counsel filed the instant
motion to be relieved as counsel on November 3, 2023.
Counsel has filed forms MC-051 and MC-052
and has lodged with the Court a copy of the proposed order on form MC-053
pursuant to CRC Rule 3.1362. 
Counsel served Client at Client’s last
known mailing address, which Counsel states he has confirmed as current within
30 days of the motion by email. Counsel also served this motion on all other
parties in the case.
Counsel states that “[i]rreconcilable
difference have arise[n] between client and attorney due to unavailability of
client, lack of cooperation and failure to communicate with attorney. As such,
attorney has been unable to effectively represent client and has no choice but
to withdraw.”  (MC-052 ¶ 2.)
Counsel is ordered to appear at the
hearing and submit a corrected proposed order on form MC-053. Based on the
notice of motion and the declaration filed by counsel, the Court is inclined to
grant the motion. However, the proposed order lodged with the Court has not
been properly completed. 
The proposed order must identify all
upcoming hearings and list the address of the Court in all items.  The Court’s records show the following
upcoming hearings, which should all be listed in the proposed order: 
 
-       
In
item 7 (next scheduled hearing): “Defendant Marvin Engineering Co., Inc.’s
Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Further Responses to Form Interrogatories, set for
January 30, 2024 at 8:30 am at 111 N. Hill St., Dept. 26, L.A., CA 90012.”  In Item 7, Counsel must also include the
following language: “Client’s failure to serve discovery responses, oppose a
discovery motion, or appear at a discovery motion hearing may result in the Court
granting the discovery motion and awarding monetary, issue, evidentiary, or
terminating sanctions against Client.”
 
-       
In item 8 (additional hearings): “Two Motions
for Summary Judgment or in the Alternative Summary Adjudication brought by Defendant
Marvin Engineering Co., Inc. and by Defendant Jennifer Lechter as the Personal
Representative of the Estate of Gerald Friedman set for March 1, 2024 at 8:30

Item
13:  “Moving Counsel is ordered to serve
all parties, including Client, with a copy of this signed order and file proof

Counsel
is responsible for determining if there are any other hearings scheduled or due
dates for discovery for this case, including any motions hearings, which must
all be listed in the proposed order.  For
each hearing, Counsel must state the date, time, and location of the hearing
including the address and Department number as follows: “111 N. Hill St., Dept.
26, L.A., CA 90012.”  For each due date
for discovery, Counsel must identify the nature of the discovery responses that
are outstanding, the due date, and the address where verified responses must be
sent.
Provided that Counsel presents a corrected
proposed order at or before the hearing on this motion, the motion to be
relieved as counsel will be granted.  Otherwise,
the motion will be denied without prejudice.
Counsel should note that after the order
is signed, the order will only become
effective upon the filing of a proof of service of a signed copy of the order
on Plaintiff. Counsel will remain the attorney of record until Counsel files
with the Court proof of service of the signed order. Counsel will be ordered to
serve a copy of the signed order (MC-053) on Plaintiff within three days. 
            Moving Counsel is ordered to provide
notice of this order and file proof of service of such.
