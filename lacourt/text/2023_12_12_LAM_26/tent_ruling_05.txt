[TENTATIVE] order RE:
Petition to Confirm arbitration award



 
Background
            On October 26, 2022, Petitioner Mei
Xia Guo (“Petitioner”) initiated a petition for expungement with the dispute
resolution arm of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) against
Respondent Cetera Investment Services, LLC (“Respondent”).  (Trotter Decl. ¶ 4, Exh. B.)  On August 2, 2023, an award pursuant to the
FINRA arbitration granting the expungement was entered in favor of Petitioner.  (Trotter Decl. ¶ 8, Exh. F.)
            On September 18, 2023, Petitioner
filed the instant petition to confirm the arbitration award.  No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
Any party to an arbitration in which an
award has been made may petition the court for confirmation of the award. (CCP §
1285.) Upon service and filing of a petition to confirm arbitration award, the
court shall confirm the award as made, unless it corrects or vacates the award,
or dismisses the proceeding. (CCP
§ 1286.) The contents of a petition to confirm an arbitration award shall set
forth the substance of or have attached a copy of the agreement to arbitrate,
the names of the arbitrators, and shall set forth or have attached a copy of
the award and the written opinion of the arbitrators.  (CCP § 1285.4.) Where the petition is served
but no response is served and filed, the allegations in the petition are deemed
admitted.  (CCP § 1290; Taheri Law Group, A.P.C. v. Sorokurs
(2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 956, 962.)   
Every presumption is in favor of the
arbitration award. (See Firestone Tire
& Rubber Co. v. United Rubber Workers of America (1959) 168 Cal.App.2d
444, 449.) Code of Civil Procedure section 1286.2 provides that “the court
shall vacate the award if the court determines any of the following: (1) [t]he
award was procured by corruption, fraud or other undue means.” (CCP § 1286.2(a).)
The defendant moving for vacation of an arbitration award due to corruption,
fraud, or other undue means must demonstrate a nexus between the award and the
alleged undue means used to attain it. (See Pour
Le Bebe, Inc. v. Guess? Inc. (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 810, 833-34.) An
objection to the granting of a motion to confirm an award is equivalent to a
motion to vacate. (See Thriftimart, Inc.
v. Superior Court (1962) 202 Cal.App.2d 421, 425-26.)
 
Discussion
Service of the Arbitration Award 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1283.6
provides that: “The neutral arbitrator shall serve a signed copy
of the award on each party to the arbitration personally or by registered or
certified mail or as provided in the agreement.”  (Id., [Italics added].)
Here, the arbitration award was served on Respondent on August 2, 2023
by FINRA – the neutral arbitrator. 
(Petition ¶ 9.)  Therefore,
service of the award is proper.
 
Service of the Petition to Confirm Arbitration and
Notice of Hearing on Petition
            A copy of petition to vacate an arbitration “and a
written notice of the time and place of the hearing thereof and any other
papers upon which the petition is based shall be served in the manner provided
in the arbitration agreement for the service of such petition and notice.”  (CCP § 1290.4(a).)  If the arbitration agreement does not set
forth a method, service shall be made in the manner provided by law for service
of summons in an action if the party has not appeared if they reside within the
state or by certified mail if the party resides outside the state. (CCP §
1290.4(b).) If the party upon whom the petition is to be made has appeared,
service can be made by noticed motion. (CCP § 1290.4(c).)  
Here, FINRA, which set forth the requirement for arbitration, does not
set forth a manner of service of a petition to confirm the award.  Thus, the manner of service must be made by
the manner provided by law for service of summons.  (See CCP § 1290.4(b).)  Here, Respondent has returned an
acknowledgement of receipt of the petition and filed a declaration noting that
there was no opposition.  (CCP § 415.30.)  This is in accordance with Code of Civil
Procedure section 1290.4(b).  Moreover,
pursuant the arbitration award, FINRA was to be named a party to the petition
unless it was specifically waived in writing by FINRA.  (Petition, Attachment
8(c).)  Here, FINRA waived in writing
the requirement to be named as an additional party to the confirmation of the
arbitration award.  (Trotter Decl. ¶ 3,
Exh. A.)
Accordingly, the service of the Petition and notice of hearing were
adequate.
 
Timeliness of Petition to
Confirm Arbitration Award
An arbitration award is not directly enforceable until it is confirmed
by a court and judgment is entered.  (CCP
§ 1287.6; Jones v.
Kvistad (1971) 19 Cal.App.3d
836, 840.) A party may seek a court judgment confirming an arbitration award by
filing and serving a petition at least 10 days, but no more than four years
after the award is served.  (CCP §§ 1288,
1288.4.) 
            As noted above, the award was served on August 2, 2023.  (Petition ¶ 9.)  The instant petition was filed on September 18,
2023.  This is within the prescribed time
period.  
 
Confirmation of the
Arbitration Award
The court must confirm the award as made, unless it corrects or vacates
the award, or dismisses the proceeding. 
(CCP § 1286; Valsan Partners Limited Partnership v. Calcor Space Facility, Inc. (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 809, 818.) CCP section
1285.4 states a petition under this chapter shall:
a)         Set
forth the substance of or have attached a copy of the agreement to arbitrate
unless the petitioner denies the existence of such an agreement.
b)         Set forth the names of
the arbitrators.
c)         Set
forth or have attached a copy of the award and the written opinion of the
arbitrators, if any.
(CCP § 1285.4.) 
            The Petition complies with the above requirements.  Petitioners seek to confirm the award as
made.  The agreement to arbitration is
set forth by Rule 13805 of the FINRA Code of Arbitration Procedure for Customer
Disputes and FINRA Rule 2080.  (Petition,
Attachment 4(B).)  The arbitrator’s name
– Robert D. Sussin – is set forth. 
(Petition ¶ 6.)  Finally, the
written opinion setting forth the award has been attached.  (Petition, Attachment 8(c).)  As the Petition is unopposed, Respondents have
not established any ground for vacating the Award. 
            Accordingly, the Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award is
granted.

Guo’s petition to confirm the arbitration award is GRANTED.
