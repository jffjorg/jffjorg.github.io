  [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
Plaintiff’s motion for attorneys’ fees and costs
 



 
Procedural
Background
            On September 27, 2021, Plaintiff
James Frey (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action against Defendant BMW of
North America, LLC (“Defendant”).  The
Complaint asserted a single cause of action for breach of express warranty
under the Song-Beverly Act, Civil Code § 1790 et seq.  
            On January
4, 2023, Plaintiff filed a notice of settlement as to the entire action.  
            On June 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion for attorneys’ fees and costs.  On November 21, 2023, Defendant filed an
opposition.  On November 28, 2023, the
Court continued the instant motion to December 12, 2023.  On November 29, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
reply.
 
Legal
Standard
Pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivision (a)(10)(A), attorney fees
when authorized by contract or statute are allowable as costs and may be
awarded upon a noticed motion pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
1033.5, subdivision (c)(5). 
In determining
what fees are reasonable, California courts apply the “lodestar” approach.
(See, e.g., Holguin v. DISH Network LLC (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 1310,
1332.)  This inquiry “begins with the
‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the
reasonable hourly rate.” (See PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th
1084, 1095.)  From there, the “[t]he
lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors
specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the
legal services provided.” (Ibid.) 
Relevant factors include: “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the
questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent
to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys, [and] (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.” (Ketchum v.
Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.)
 
Discussion
Right to Recover
A prevailing
buyer in an action under the Song-Beverly Act “shall be allowed by the court to
recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs
and expenses, including attorney's fees based on actual time expended,
determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in
connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action.” (Civ. Code, §
1794(d).)  “[W]hen ‘prevailing party’ is
undefined by the statute, ‘a court may base its attorney fees decision on a pragmatic
definition of the extent to which each party has realized its litigation
objectives, whether by judgment, settlement or otherwise. [Citations.] In
assessing litigation success, Hsu v. Abbara (1995) 9 Cal.4th
863, 877, ... instructs: ‘[C]ourts should respect substance rather than form,
and to this extent should be guided by “equitable considerations.”’”  (MacQuiddy v. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (2015)
233 Cal.App.4th 1036, 1048.)
            On December 29, 2022, the parties
settled the instant action.  (Sannipoli
Decl. ¶ 39.)  As part of this settlement,
Plaintiff was established as the prevailing party for purposes of attorneys’
fees and costs under Civil Code section 1794(d).  (Sannipoli Decl. ¶ 40, H.).)  Moreover, no party disputes that Plaintiff is
entitled to attorney’s fees and expenses as the prevailing party.  
 
Reasonableness of Attorneys’ Fees 
Plaintiff seeks
attorney’s fees and costs totaling $40,088.84 consisting of $39,042.00 in
attorneys’ fees and $1,046.84 in costs. 
The trial court
has broad authority to determine the amount of a reasonable fee. (PLCM
Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) The party bears the
burden of proof as to “reasonableness” of any fee claim. (Code Civ. Proc., §
1033.5, subd. (c)(5).) The party seeking fees has the burden of documenting the
appropriate hours expended and hourly rates. (City of Colton v. Singletary
(2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 751, 784.) This burden requires competent evidence as to
the nature and value of the services rendered. (Martino v. Denevi (1986)
182 Cal.App.3d 553, 559.) 
An attorney's
testimony as to the number of hours worked is sufficient evidence to support an
award of attorney fees, even in the absence of detailed time records or billing
statements, and there is no requirement that such records or statements be
offered in evidence. (Steiny & Co., Inc. v. California Electric Supply
Co. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 285, 293.) 
Ascertaining the fee amount is left to the trial court’s sound
discretion. (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.)  Moreover, “[t]here is ‘no mathematical rule
requiring proportionality between compensatory damages and attorney's fees
awards’, [Citation], and courts have awarded attorney's fees where plaintiffs
recovered only nominal or minimal damages.” 
(Harman v. City and County of San Francisco (2007) 158
Cal.App.4th 407, 421.)
The court has
broad discretion in determining the amount of a reasonable attorney’s fee
award, which will not be overturned absent a “manifest abuse of discretion, a
prejudicial error of law, or necessary findings not supported by substantial
evidence.” (Bernardi v. County of Monterey (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th
1379, 1393-1394.)  The court need not explain its calculation of the
amount of attorney’s fees awarded in detail; identifying the factors considered
in arriving at the amount will suffice. (Ventura v. ABM Indus. Inc.
(2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 258, 274-275.) 
            Here,
Plaintiff asserts that a total of four attorneys, and five paralegals/legal
assistant worked on the instant action on behalf of Plaintiffs.  
            Attorney
Brian J. Bickel has been an attorney since 1999 and is the founder of
Plaintiff’s Counsel firm with significant experience with Song-Beverly
claims.  (Sannipoli Decl. ¶ 54.) Bickel
bills at an hourly rate of $685 in 2022 and $695 in 2023 and states that he
spent 0.4 hours on the instant action. 
(Sannipoli Decl. ¶ 54, Exh. B.)  Attorney
Jordan K. Sannipoli is a named partner at Plaintiff’s Counsel and has litigated
Song-Beverly claims since 2015. 
(Sannipoli Decl. ¶ 54.)  Sannipoli
billed at $605 per hour in and claims to have spent 33.3 hours on the instant
action.  (Sannipoli Decl. ¶ 54, Exh.
B.)  Attorney Stephanie S. Pengilley is
senior counsel at Plaintiff’s Counsel and has been licensed to practice since
2015.  (Sannipoli Decl. ¶ 54.)  In 2021, Pengilley billed at an hourly rate
of $515 which in 2022 was increased to $545 in 2022 and claims that she spent 21.5
hours on the instant action.  (Sannipoli
Decl. ¶ 54, Exh. B.)  Attorney John P.
Myers has been an attorney since 2017. 
(Sannipoli Decl. ¶ 54.)  Myers
billed at an hourly rate of $475 and claims that he spent 8.5 hours on the
instant action.  (Sannipoli Decl. ¶ 115,
Exh. B.)  In addition, Paralegals and
legal assistants spent a total of 13.3 hours on the instant action with hourly
rates between $195 and $265.  (Sannipoli
Decl. ¶ 54, Exh. B.)  
            Plaintiff
also points to other attorneys who work on similar hourly rates in 2022.  (Sannipoli Decl. ¶ 56.)  Further, Plaintiff points to numerous other
actions in which Plaintiff’s Counsel’s hourly rates were approved.  (Sannipoli Decl. ¶¶ 58-59.)  Based on the stated experience of each
respective attorney, prevailing rates of similar experienced attorneys, and the
Court’s own experience, the Court finds the hourly rates are reasonable.  
However, the
number of attorney’s working on the instant action is slightly excessive,
resulting in some inefficiencies. “Plainly, it is appropriate for a trial court
to reduce a fee award based on its reasonable determination that a routine,
non-complex case was overstaffed to a degree that significant inefficiencies
and inflated fees resulted.”  (Morris
v. Hyundai Motor America (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 24, 39.)  Here, the instant action did not involve any
complicated issues.  Rather, the instant
action was simple and routine and involved little to no litigation and no
motion practice other than the instant motion.
            In
opposition, Defendant claims that the hours should be significantly reduced due
to improper block billing.  “Block
billing occurs when ‘a block of time [is assigned] to multiple tasks rather
than itemizing the time spent on each task.’ [Citation.]”  (Mountjoy v. Bank of America, N.A. (2016)
245 Cal.App.4th 266, 279.)  The instant
billing is ripe with block billing. 
Nearly every entry includes multiple tasks claimed.  (See e.g., Sannipoli Decl., Exh. A, [“Email to Attorney Stephanie Pengilley
regarding 2/28 Case Management Conference. Draft Case Management Statement and
proof of service. Scan and submit Plaintiff's Case Management Statement and
Joint Case Management Conference Statement Addendum through One Legal for
filing with court. Serve same on opposing counsel via email. Email to Attorney
Stephanie Pengilley and note to file regarding same.”].)  When block billing occurs, the “[t]rial
courts retain discretion to penalize block billing when the practice prevents
them from discerning which tasks are compensable and which are not.”  (Heritage Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy (2013)
215 Cal.App.4th 972, 1010.)  Accordingly,
the fact that block billing occurred is itself not enough to warrant a
reduction.  However, as noted above, the
instant action was slightly overstaffed with many hours claimed on interoffice
communications that would have been unnecessary had fewer attorneys been
working on the action.  Further, there
are many administrative tasks that are included in the block billing, such as
sending notes to the client file etc. 
Thus, some reduction in time is warranted due to the block billing as
the block billing prevents the time from being properly divided from
unnecessary and unreasonable time spent in interoffice communications due to
overstaffing and reasonable time spent working on the instant action.
            Moreover,
the time claimed on the instant motion is clearly excessive.  Plaintiff Counsel claims 30.4 hours on just
the instant motion.  Given the claimed
experience of Counsel and, Plaintiff Counsel’s past experience in drafting
these motions, and the fact that little to no litigation occurred in the
instant action, the instant motion should have been a simple matter and should
not take nearly half of the total claimed time on the instant action.  Accordingly, based on the totality of the
circumstances the Court finds that $22,675.00 reasonably represents the
attorneys’ fees incurred with the instant action.
 
Costs
As to costs, the claimed costs of
$1,046.84 are uncontested and do appear to be reasonably incurred with the
instant action.  (CCP § 1033.5.)  Moreover, “the Legislature amended section
1794 to provide for the recovery of “costs and expenses.” The
legislative history indicates the Legislature exercised its power to permit the
recovery of expert witness fees by prevailing buyers under the Act[.]”  (Ibid.)  “[T]he Legislature intended the phrase ‘costs
and expenses’ to cover items not included in ‘the detailed statutory definition
of “costs” ’ set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5.”  (Warren v. Kia Motors America, Inc. (2018)
30 Cal.App.5th 24, 42.)  Therefore, a
prevailing buyer is entitled to “costs and expenses” that have been “determined
by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with
the commencement and prosecution of such action.”  (Civ. Code, § 1794(d).)
Accordingly, the requested costs are granted
in full.
 
CONCLUSIONS AND
ORDER
            Based on the forgoing, Plaintiff
James Frey’s motion for attorneys’ fees
and costs is granted in the total amount of $23,721.84 consisting of $22,675.00 in Attorneys’ Fees and $1046.84 in
Costs.
            Moving Parties are ordered to
provide notice of this order and file proof of service of such.
