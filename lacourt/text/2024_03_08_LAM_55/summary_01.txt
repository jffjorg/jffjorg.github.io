Significant Statements:
  - "The reasonable conclusion from this language is that Dr. Jo may administer one or more of the 29 tests listed in the demand and/or may use other tests that are not listed in the demand."
  - "The revised demand contains other problems. It states that Dr. Joâ€™s evaluation will include a parent interview. The prior notice made no mention of a parent interview as part of the neuropsychological examination and the Court is unaware of any authority that would permit an IME order to include an interview of a parent as part of a neuropsychological exam."
  - "Defendant has not filed a motion for a protective order, which would require a showing of good cause. Under these circumstances, the Defendant has no basis to demand a protective order to produce information that it is required to turn over pursuant to the Code of Civil Procedure."

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted in part and denied in part the defendant's motion for leave of court to conduct independent medical examinations (IMEs) and reopen discovery for medical records and deposition. The court finds that good cause exists to reopen discovery to subpoena the plaintiff's recent medical records and depose the plaintiff regarding her new complaints. However, the court has denied the motion in part because the revised demands for additional IMEs remain overly broad in scope. The court had previously directed the defendant to narrow the list of potential tests to be administered, but the revised demands do not comply with this direction. The court is unaware of any authority that would permit an IME order to include an interview of a parent as part of a neuropsychological exam, and the defendant has not filed a motion for a protective order to produce information that it is required to turn over. The court's tentative ruling will be finalized after the parties have an opportunity to review and respond.
