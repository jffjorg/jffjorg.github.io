[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST
  FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
May 17, 2024



 
On May 24, 2022 Plaintiff Eboni Gardner filed a first
amended complaint (“FAC”) against Defendant Valley Creek Hospice Inc. and others.  On February 9, 2023, the Court entered default
against Valley Creek Hospice Inc. on the FAC. 
On June 22, 2023, the Court denied Plaintiff’s request for default judgment
with an order that detailed the request’s many deficiencies.
On August 25, 2023, Plaintiff filed a second amended
complaint (“SAC”) against Defendant Valley Creek Hospice Inc. and other now-dismissed
defendants.  On November 29, 2023, the Court
entered default against Defendant on the SAC. 
On February 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed this request for entry of default judgment.
Plaintiff seeks a judgment of $992,103.90, consisting
of $978,866.71 in damages, $12,486.32 in attorney fees, and $750.87 in costs.
According to the memorandum of costs, the type and amount
of costs are reasonable.
Plaintiff’s counsel provides a copy of billing records,
and the requested attorney fees appear reasonable.  However, Plaintiff does not cite any authority
for attorney fees.  The Court assumes that
attorney fees are sought under Government Code section 12965, subdivision (b).
“‘Plaintiffs in a default judgment proceeding must prove
they are entitled to the damages claimed.’ 
[Citation].”  (Kim v. Westmoore
Partners, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, 288.)  “[T]he plaintiff must affirmatively establish
his entitlement to the specific judgment requested.” (Id. at p. 287.)
Plaintiff’s declaration does not prove her damages.  Plaintiff explains the bases for her emotional
distress, but the damages amounts are unclear. 
Plaintiff provides evidence that she attended therapy and was proscribed
certain medications.  (Gardner Decl. ¶¶ 34-35
& Exs. 6-8.)  She also states, without
providing any calculations, that she began earning approximately $80,000.00 beginning
in May 2022, and she sued to earn $35.00/hour when working for Defendant.  (Gardner Decl. ¶ 36.)  From this limited information, the Court cannot
determine Plaintiff’s actual damages.
Plaintiff’s damages for emotional distress (see Gardner
Decl. ¶¶ 33-35) are “damages for personal injury.”  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 425.11, subd. (b).)  There is no evidence that Plaintiff served a Statement
of Damages on Defendant before the November 29, 2023 entry of default.  (See
Code Civ. Proc., § 425.11, subd.
(c).)  Instead, Plaintiff filed a Statement
of Damages on February 16, 2024 and indicated that it was served on Defendant by
mail also on February 16, 2024.
In order to obtain damages for personal injury,
Plaintiff must file and serve an amended complaint and serve Defendant with a Statement
of Damages before seeking Defendant’s default.
Additionally, even if the Statement of Damages
had been properly served, it would not support the amount of damages requested for
this default judgment.  The Statement of Damages
sets forth $100,00.00 for “Pain, suffering, and inconvenience,” $600,000.00 for
“Emotional distress,” and $78.866.71 for “Loss of earnings.”  This is less than the $978,866.71 in damages requested here.  Although the SAC demands a total amount of $992,103.90,
this is not a substitute for compliance with the Statement of Damages.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 425.10, subd. (b) [“where
an action is brought to recover actual or punitive damages for personal injury or
wrongful death, the amount demanded shall not be stated”].)
The request for entry of default judgment is DENIED WITHOUT
PREJUDICE.
An Order to Show Cause Re: Failure to Obtain Entry of
Default Judgment is scheduled for August 16, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
