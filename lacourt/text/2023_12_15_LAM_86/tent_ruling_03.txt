[1] Specifically, Singleton declares that Defendant
owes the sum of $12,558.39 on the contract. 
(Id. ¶ 6.) He also submits evidence that the “average” trade-in
value for the Vehicle is $9,400.00. (Id.
¶ 8, Exh. C.) While the J.D. Power report submitted by Singleton states that
the “clean retail” value of the Vehicle is $13,100, the court concludes that
the average trade-in value provides a better estimate of the value of the
Vehicle for purposes of the undertaking calculation.
