And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion for a writ of attachment filed by NFS Leasing, Inc. (Plaintiff) against Terren Peizer (Defendant). The Plaintiff is seeking to attach $600,000 of the Defendant's assets. The Plaintiff has filed a verified complaint and ex parte application for a writ of attachment, which was previously denied. The Plaintiff has now filed a new application, which the Court is granting. The Court finds that the Plaintiff has demonstrated a probably valid claim for breach of contract against the Defendant, and that the attachment is not sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the claim. The Court orders the Plaintiff to post an undertaking in the amount of $10,000 and grants the application for a writ of attachment in the amount of $600,000. The Court also denies the Plaintiff's request for a turnover order and temporary protective order.
