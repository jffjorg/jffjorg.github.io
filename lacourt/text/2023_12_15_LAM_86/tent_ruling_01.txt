[Tentative]       
ORDER GRANTING APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF ATTACHMENT 
 
 
Plaintiff, NFS Leasing, Inc., moves for a writ of
attachment against Defendant, Terren Peizer, in the amount of $600,000.
 
Plaintiff’s Request for Judicial Notice (RJN) of Exhibits
A through G is granted.
 
RELEVANT PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
On October 10, 2023, Plaintiff filed a verified
complaint for breach of contract against Defendants Acuitas Group Holdings, LLC
and Terren Peizer.  
 
On October 30, 2023, Plaintiff filed an ex parte
application for a writ of attachment or, in the alternative, a temporary
protective order against Defendant Peizer.
 
On October 31, 2023, Plaintiff filed a proof of
service of summons as to Defendant Peizer and also an Affidavit of Service for Plaintiff’s
ex parte application. The proof of service and affidavit show personal service
of the summons, complaint, and ex parte application for writ of attachment on
an authorized agent of Defendant Peizer in Dorado, Puerto Rico on October 28,
2023.
 
On October 31, 2023, the court continued the
hearing on the ex parte application to November 1, 2023. Attorney James Unger
appeared at the October 31 ex parte hearing on behalf of Defendant Peizer.
 
On November 1, 2023, the court denied the ex
parte application finding that Plaintiff had not met its burden for an
attachment on an ex parte basis.  The
court set a hearing on an application for writ of attachment for December 15,
2023; ordered that the ex parte papers would be considered the moving papers;
and ordered counsel for Plaintiff to give notice.  Attorney James Unger appeared at the November
1 ex parte hearing on behalf of Defendant Peizer.
 
On November 3, 2023, Plaintiff filed and served a
notice of ruling re: Plaintiff’s ex parte application for writ of attachment. Plaintiff
served the notice by mail on Defendant Peizer’s attorneys, David Willingham and
James Unger
 
Defendant Peizer has not opposed the application.  
 
APPLICABLE LAW 
 
“Upon the filing of the complaint or at
any time thereafter, the plaintiff may apply pursuant to this article for a
right to attach order and a writ of attachment by filing an application for the
order and writ with the court in which the action is brought.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 484.010.)
 
The court
shall issue a right to attach order if the court finds all
of
the following: 
 
(1)   The claim
upon which the attachment is based is one upon which an attachment may be
issued. 
(2)   The
plaintiff has established the probable validity of the claim upon which the
attachment is based. 
(3)   The
attachment is not sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the claim
upon which the attachment is based. 
(4)   The amount
to be secured by the attachment is greater than zero.  
 
(Id. at
§ 484.090.) 
 
“A claim has ‘probable validity’
where it is more likely than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment
against the defendant on that claim.” (Id. at § 481.190.) “The application
shall be supported by an affidavit showing that the plaintiff on the facts
presented would be entitled to a judgment on the claim upon which the
attachment is based.”¿(Id. at § 484.030.)¿“In contested applications,
the court must consider the relative merits of the positions of the respective
parties and make a determination of¿the probable outcome of the litigation.”¿(Hobbs
v. Weiss (1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 76, 80.) 

 
“The Attachment Law statutes are subject
to strict construction.” (Epstein v. Abrams (1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 1159, 1168.)  
 
“If the
defendant fails to file a notice of opposition within the time prescribed, the
defendant shall not be permitted to oppose the issuance of the order.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 484.060, subd. (a).)
 
ANALYSIS 
 
Notice 
 
Notice appears proper as stated above.  
 
Probable Validity of Plaintiff’s Claim
 
The
application is based on Plaintiff’s cause of action for breach of a guaranty
agreement. To establish a claim for breach of contract, a plaintiff must prove:
(1) existence of a contract; 
(2)
plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance; (3) defendant’s breach of
the contract; and (4) damages incurred by plaintiff resulting from the breach. (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare, (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th
1350, 1367.)  
 
Plaintiff
submits evidence supporting all elements of its contract claim against
Defendant Peizer. Specifically, as relevant here, Plaintiff, as lender, entered
a Master Equipment Finance Agreement with Distinct Cars LLC, as borrower.
Defendant Peizer executed a written personal guaranty (Guaranty) of up to
$600,00 of Distinct’s obligations under the finance agreement.  Thereafter, Distinct failed to make payments
to Plaintiff on the finance agreement in the amount of $1,030,010.17. Plaintiff
sent Distinct a notice of default demanding that Distinct cure its default. Distinct
failed to cure the default. Pursuant to paragraph
8(vii) of the finance agreement, because Distinct defaulted on its obligations
to Plaintiff, Plaintiff was permitted to accelerate and declare immediately due
and payable all sums due under the finance agreement. Plaintiff sent a demand
letter and notice to Defendant Peizer, demanding payment to Plaintiff for
$600,000.00, as permitted by the Guaranty following Distinct's default. Since
receiving the demand letter, Defendant Peizer has refused to make payment to
Plaintiff as required by the Guaranty. (Calumby Decl. ¶¶ 3-10, Exh. A-E.)
 
Defendant
has not filed an opposition and has not rebutted any of Plaintiff’s evidence
summarized above. Based on Plaintiff’s evidence, Plaintiff has demonstrated a
probably valid claim for breach of contract in the amount of $600,000 against
Defendant Peizer.
 
Basis of Attachment 
 
“[A]n
attachment may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for money, each
of which is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the total amount
of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount not less than
five hundred dollars ($500) exclusive of costs, interest, and attorney's fees.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 483.010, subd. (a).) 
“An attachment
may not be issued on a claim which is secured by any interest in real property
arising from agreement . . . .” (Code Civ. Proc, § 483.010, subd. (b).) “If the
action is against a defendant who is a natural person, an attachment may be
issued only on a claim which arises out of the conduct by the defendant of a
trade, business, or profession. (Id. at § 483.010, subd. (c);
see Advance Transformer co. v. Sup.Ct. (1974)
44 Cal.App.3d 127, 143-144.)
 
Here, Plaintiff’s application for writ of attachment
is based on an agreement where the total amount allegedly due exceeds $500. The
Guaranty is not secured by real property. Plaintiff’s damages are fixed and
readily ascertainable from the terms of the Guaranty and Plaintiff’s
declaration and exhibits. The evidence shows Defendant executed the guaranty as
part of his trade, business, or profession. (See Calumby Decl. ¶¶ 4-7, Exh. B,
C.)
 
Purpose
and Amount of Attachment 
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 484.090 states the Court shall issue a right to
attach order if “the attachment is not sought for a purpose other than the
recovery on the claim upon which the attachment is based . . . [and] the amount
to be secured by the attachment is greater than zero.”
 
Plaintiff
declares, and the court finds, attachment here is not sought for a purpose
other than the recovery on Plaintiff’s contract claim. (Appl. ¶ 4.) The amount
to be secured is greater than zero.
 
Reduction of
Amount to be Secured by Attachment 
 
Defendant
has not argued or proven that the attachment should be reduced by an attachable
claim for offset or an affirmative defense. (Code Civ. Proc., § 483.015, subd. (b).)
 
Subject Property
 
Plaintiff
requests attachment against Defendant, a natural person, of items listed in Code
of Civil Procedure section 487.010, subdivisions (c) and (d). (Application ¶
9c.) Plaintiff’s request is proper. (See Bank of America v. Salinas Nissan,
Inc. (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 267-268 [“all-inclusive” application
satisfies Code of Civil Procedure section 484.020, subd. (e)].)  
 
Undertaking 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 489.210
requires Plaintiff to file an undertaking before issuance of a writ of
attachment. Code of Civil Procedure section 489.220 provides, with exceptions,
for an undertaking in the amount of $10,000. 
 
Turnover Order
 
Plaintiff
seeks a turnover order. (See Proposed Order ¶ 3.d.) “If a writ of attachment is
issued, the court may also issue an order directing the defendant to transfer
to the levying officer either or both of the following: [¶] (1) Possession of
the property to be attached if the property is sought to be attached by taking
it into custody. [¶] (2) Possession of documentary evidence of title to
property of or a debt owed to the defendant that is sought to be attached.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 482.080.)  
 
Plaintiff
has not shown the applicability of this section to its attachment request or
briefed the necessity of this additional remedy. The request for a turnover
order is therefore denied.
 
Temporary
Protective Order 
 
Plaintiff also seeks
a temporary protective order (TPO) with respect to all of Defendant’s
assets.  (Proposed TPO ¶¶ 2.i and 3.) Plaintiff’s
request for a TPO is moot and unnecessary because the court is granting the
application for writ of attachment.  
 
CONCLUSION 
 
The application for writ of attachment is GRANTED
in the amount of $600,000. Plaintiff shall post an undertaking in the amount of
$10,000.  
 
The request for a turnover order is denied.
 
The request for a temporary protective order is
denied.
 
 IT IS SO ORDERED.
