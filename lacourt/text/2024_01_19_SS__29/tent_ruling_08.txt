 Case Number:  22STCV01221    Hearing Date:   January 19, 2024    Dept:  29 TENTATIVE 
 
The Court excuses the personal
appearance of the claimant and the guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by
telephone or video conference call.  
 
The Court has reviewed the filed Petitioner
for Minor’s Compromise. The overall settlement and the requested attorney’s
fees appear to be reasonable.  There are
two deficiencies that need to be rectified, however, before the Court can
approve the petition.
 
First, Petitioner claims reimbursement of $764.95
in costs in No. 14(b)(3), but No. 13 is blank and does not describe the costs..

 
Second, Petitioner selects 18b(5) for the net
settlement to be distributed to Claimant’s parents but fails to include the
required Attachment 18b(5) with the petition.
 
Accordingly, the matter is CONTINUED to allow petitioner to rectify
the aforementioned deficiencies. 
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
