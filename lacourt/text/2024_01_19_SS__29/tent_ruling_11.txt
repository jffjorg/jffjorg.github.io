 Case Number:  22STCV23900    Hearing Date:   January 19, 2024    Dept:  29 Tentative
 
The hearing is CONTINUED.
 
Background
 
Plaintiff Jose E. Ayla Rios and Ruben Jimenez Baltazar (“Plaintiffs”)
filed their Complaint in this matter, Case No. 22STCV23900, on July 25, 2022 (the “Rios Action).  In the Rios Action, Plaintiff assert causes
of action for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence against Sergio
Antonio Vega Campos (“Vega Campos”), Artemio Reyes Huertas (“Reyes Huertas”), and
Does 1 through 20, arising out of an alleged vehicle accident on June 7, 2021,
on Alameda Street between 109th and 110th Street in Los Angeles, California.
 
On November 9, 2022, Vega Campos filed his Answer to the
Complaint and a Cross-Complaint against Reyes Huertas and Roes 1 through 20.
 
On December 9, 2022, Reyes Huertas filed his Answer to
the Complaint and a Cross-Complaint against Vega Campos and Roes 1 through 100.
 
On December 19, 2022, Vega Campos filed his Answer to the
Cross-Complaint.
 
On June 7, 2023, Vega Campos filed the Complaint in a new
case, Case No. 23CMCV00836 (the “Vega Campos Action”), asserting causes of action
for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence against Reyes Huertas and
Does 1 through 25.  The Vega Campos Action
appears to arise out of the same vehicle accident as the Rios Action.  
 
On June 23, 2023, the Court deemed the Rios Action to be
related to the Vega Campos Action.
 
On November 7, 2023, Vega Campos filed a motion to
consolidate the two cases.  
 
On November 21, 2023, Reyes Huertas filed a demurrer to the
Complaint in the Vega Campos Action.  The
demurrer is set for hearing on February 8, 2024.
 
On December 5, 2023, Reyes Huertas filed an opposition to
the motion to consolidate.
 
 
 
Legal Standard
 
“When
actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the
court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue
in the actions; it may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such
orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or
delay.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1048 (a).)
 
The
trial court should not consolidate actions where prejudice would result any
party, e.g., when consolidation would cause a litigant to need to adopt adverse
litigations positions in a single trial. 
(See State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1956) 47
Cal.2d 428, 430.)
 
Per
Local Rule 3.3, subdivision (g), “Cases may not be consolidated unless they are
in the same department.  A motion to
consolidate two or more cases may be noticed and heard after the cases,
initially filed in different departments, have been related into a single
department, or if the cases were already assigned to that department.”  (Super. Ct. L.A. County, Local Rules, rule
3.3(g)(1).)  Once the Court relates the
cases, the Court may consolidate the actions and order a joint trial on matters
that “involv[e] a common question of law or fact.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§1048, subd. (a).)
 
Discussion
 
Vega
Campos moves to consolidate the Rios Action and Vega Campos Action, arguing
that the two cases arise out of the same vehicle accident and involve overlapping
parties.  Reyes Huertas opposes the
motion, arguing that his pending demurrer will likely dispose of the Vega
Campos Action.  In the alternative, Reyes
Huertas asks that the Court continue the hearing on the motion to consolidate
until after the hearing on his demurrer.
 
In the
interests of judicial economy, the Court CONTINUES the hearing on the motion to
consolidate to a date after the hearing on the demurrer in the Vega Campos
Action.
 
The
Court expresses no views on the merits of the demurrer.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court CONTINUES the hearing on the motion
to consolidate until at least February 15, 2024, so that the demurrer in the
Vega Campos matter can be heard first.
