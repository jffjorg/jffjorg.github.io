Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the action. The plaintiff had filed a complaint alleging negligence stemming from a motor vehicle collision and had sought to set aside the dismissal based on Code of Civil Procedure § 473(b) and § 1008. The court had previously denied the motion, but had given the plaintiff an opportunity to provide supplemental briefing on setting aside the dismissal on equitable grounds. However, the plaintiff failed to file the requested briefing, and the court has now denied the motion. The court's decision is based on the fact that the plaintiff did not demonstrate a meritorious case, did not articulate a satisfactory excuse for not presenting a defense to the original action, and did not demonstrate diligence in seeking to set aside the default once discovered.
