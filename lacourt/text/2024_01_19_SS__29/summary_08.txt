And here is the summary in English text:

The court has reviewed the Petitioner for Minor's Compromise and finds the overall settlement and requested attorney's fees to be reasonable. However, there are two deficiencies that need to be addressed before the petition can be approved. The first is that the Petitioner claims reimbursement of $764.95 in costs, but does not describe the costs. The second is that the Petitioner selected 18b(5) for the net settlement to be distributed to the Claimant's parents, but failed to include the required Attachment 18b(5) with the petition. As a result, the matter is continued to allow the Petitioner to rectify these deficiencies.
