And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff's motion to compel defendant Target Corporation to provide further responses to the plaintiff's Requests for Production (Set One) is taken off calendar. The reason for this decision is the plaintiff's failure to participate in the required Informal Discovery Conferences, as outlined in the Eighth Amended Standing Order for Procedures in the Personal Injury Hub Courts. The plaintiff had previously filed two motions to compel, one for Requests for Production (Set One) and another for Requests for Production (Set Two). The hearings for these motions were continued multiple times due to the plaintiff's failure to participate in the Informal Discovery Conferences. As a result, the motions are now taken off calendar.
