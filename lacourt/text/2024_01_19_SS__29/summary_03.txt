Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to bifurcate filed by the defendants Uber Technologies, Inc, Rasier-CA, LLC, and Rasier, LLC. The motion is denied without prejudice. The Judge finds that the trial judge should determine whether bifurcation is warranted, as it is closely related to trial management. The Judge orders that the moving defendants may submit a motion for bifurcation at the time that motions in limine are filed, and any other party may submit an opposition when oppositions to motions in limine are filed. The Judge also orders that the bifurcation briefing be included in the trial binders in Tab B along with any motions in limine filed in the case.
