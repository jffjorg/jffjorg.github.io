The motion to be relieved is GRANTED.
Background
On May 9, 2022, State Farm Mutual
Automobile Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint relating to a motor vehicle accident on June 19, 2021,
involving Defendant Roman Middleton, and Does 1 through 25. On October 12,
2022, Plaintiff filed two Amendments to Complaint to name Antoine T. Middleton
as DOE 1, and Tonisha L. Miller as DOE 2. 
On October 17 15, 2023, Alexandra Barreno filed a motion to be relieved as
counsel for Defendant. No opposition has been filed. 
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
Counsel has
filed the Notice, Declaration, and Order to be Relieved as Counsel, and has
included with each proof of service on Defendant and other parties in this
matter. 
Counsel in the
Declaration states that she has been unable to confirm with the client his
address, but has taken the following efforts to locate his address:
(1)  Mailed motion papers with return receipt requested;
(2)   Calling the last
known telephone number of client;
(3)  Contacting co-defendant Tonisha Miller;
(4)  Conducting a search on Accurint; and
(5)  Through a private investigator.
The Court finds
that all substantive and procedural requirements have been satisfied.  The Court GRANTS the motion.
Conclusion
The motion to be
relieved as counsel is GRANTED.
The order is
effective upon filing with the Court a proof of service of the order on the
client.
Moving counsel is ordered to give notice.
