The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to consolidate two cases, Case No. 22STCV23900 and Case No. 23CMCV00836, both related to a vehicle accident on June 7, 2021. The motion was brought by Vega Campos, who argues that the two cases involve the same vehicle accident and overlapping parties. Reyes Huertas, the opposing party, opposes the motion, citing his pending demurrer in the Vega Campos Action. The Judge has decided to CONTINUE the hearing on the motion to consolidate until at least February 15, 2024, allowing the demurrer in the Vega Campos Action to be heard first.
