The Judge has granted the motion to continue the trial, scheduled for January 19, 2024, due to good cause shown by the Defendant. The Defendant has attempted to notice the deposition of the Plaintiff five times, with the most recent notice being on January 12, 2024. The Defendant requires more than 90 days after the deposition to complete its defense investigation and to conduct two independent medical examinations of the Plaintiff. The Judge has considered the factors set forth in California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332, and has determined that a continuance is necessary to ensure a fair and just outcome. The trial is now set for a date on or after June 24, 2024, and all deadlines are reset accordingly.
