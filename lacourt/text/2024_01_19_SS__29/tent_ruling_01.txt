Interrogatories (Set 1) and Supplemental Request for Production (Set 1) filed
by Defendant Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
 
Tentative
The motions to compel are GRANTED.
The requests for sanctions are GRANTED in
part.
Background
This case arises
from a fall that allegedly occurred at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center on April
12, 2017.  Plaintiff Samuel Aurebach
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action on April 5, 2019, asserting a cause of action for
premises liability against Defendant Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (“CSMC”) and
Does 1 through 50.  CSMC filed its Answer
to the Complaint on May 10, 2019.
 
Plaintiff
amended his complaint on June 23, 2021, to name Defendant ABM Building
Solutions LLC as Doe 1 and Defendant ABM Global Facility Service as Doe 2.  At the request of Plaintiff, those two
entities were dismissed on April 27, 2022. 

 
Also on April
27, 2022, Plaintiff amended his complaint to name Defendant ABM Industries
Groups, LLC as Doe 3.  On June 10, 2022,
Defendant ABM Industry Groups, LLC (“ABM”) filed its Answer to the Complaint.
 
On May
12, 2023, CSMC served Plaintiff with discovery, including Supplemental
Interrogatories (Set One) and Supplemental Requests for Production (Set One).  (Radochonski Decls., ¶ 3 & Exhs. 1.)  Plaintiff did not respond to this
discovery.  (Id., ¶ 5.)
 
On
October 24, 2023, CSMC filed the two discovery motions that are set for hearing
on January 19: motions to compel Plaintiff to respond to the supplemental interrogatories
and the supplemental requests for production. 
CSMC requests sanctions in each motion.
 
Plaintiff
filed a combined opposition to the motions on January 5.  CSMC filed a combined reply on January 11.
 
Trial is
scheduled for July 23, 2024.
 
Legal Standard
A party
must respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd.
(b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no
meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition,
a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a
party moves to compel initial responses to interrogatories, “the court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (c).)
A party
must respond to requests for production of documents within 30 days after
service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests
for production of documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the
requesting party may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (Id.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., §
2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial
responses to requests for production, “the court shall impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery
Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines
“[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery.” 
Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery
process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2023.020, subd. (a).)
“[P]roviding
untimely responses does not divest the trial court of its authority [to hear a
motion to compel responses].”  (Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 407.)  Even if the untimely response “does not
contain objections [and] substantially resolve[s] the issues raised by a motion
to compel responses … the trial court retains the authority to hear the
motion.”  (Id. at pp. 408-409.)  This rule gives “an important
incentive for parties to respond to discovery in a timely fashion.”  (Id.
at p. 408.)  If “the propounding party [does not] take the motion off
calendar or narrow its scope to the issue of sanctions,” the trial court may
“deny the motion to compel responses as essentially unnecessary, in whole or in
part, and just impose sanctions.”  (Id. at p. 409.) “The court may
award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion
to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or
opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided
to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1348(a).)  
Discussion
CSMC served
Supplemental Interrogatories (Set One) and Supplemental Requests for Production
(Set One) on Plaintiff on May 12, 2023. 
(Radochonski Decls., ¶ 3 & Exhs. 1.) 
Plaintiff has not responded to the discovery.  (Id., ¶ 5.)  Indeed, in his opposition, Plaintiff concedes
that he has not responded, stating that he “always intended to comply with all
discovery” and that responses “will be served before the hearing.”  (Opp. at p. 2.)
 
CSMC has
made a sufficient showing for orders compelling Plaintiff to respond to the
discovery.  The motion is GRANTED.
 
CSMC’s
request for sanctions is also GRANTED in part. 
Notwithstanding Plaintiff’s statement of his intention and his promises
to comply, it appears that it was necessary for CSMC to file this motion to
obtain responses to its discovery. 
Plaintiff has not acted with substantial justification, and it would not
be unjust to impose monetary sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act.  Given the relatively
straightforward nature of a motion to compel initial responses, and the
economies of scale associated with filing multiple discovery motions, the Court
sets sanctions on each motion in the amount of $510, calculated based on 2
hours of attorney work, multiplied by counsel’s reasonable billing rate of $225.00
per hour, plus the $60.00 filing fee.  (Radochonski
Decls., ¶ 6.)
 
Conclusion
 
The Court GRANTS CSMC’s motions to compel.
 
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff to serve code-compliant,
verified, written responses, without objection, to CSMC’s Supplemental interrogatories (Set One) within 21 days of
notice of this ruling.
 
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff to serve code-compliant,
verified, written responses, without objection, to CSMC’s Supplemental Requests for Production (Set One) within 21
days of notice of this ruling.

The Court ORDERS Plaintiff and counsel of record the Law
Offices of Jacob Emrani, P.C., jointly and severally, to pay monetary sanctions
to CSMC under the Civil Discovery Act in the amount of $1,020 ($510 per motion,
multiplied by two motions) within 21 days of notice of this ruling.
 
Moving party is
ORDERED to give notice.
