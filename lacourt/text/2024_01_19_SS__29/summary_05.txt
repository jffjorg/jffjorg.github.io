And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering four motions to compel discovery filed by the plaintiff, which seek various documents and information from the defendants. The defendants have opposed the motions, claiming that some of the requested information is privileged or protected.

The judge has granted some of the motions to compel, including requests for production of documents and interrogatories that seek information about the installation of LED lights at the intersection where the accident occurred. The judge has also granted some of the motions to compel, including requests for admission and form interrogatories, that seek information about the authenticity and admissibility of certain documents and videos.

The judge has denied other motions to compel, including requests for production of certain documents and interrogatories that seek information about the defendants' internal deliberations and decision-making processes. The judge has also denied a motion to compel that seeks information about the defendants' responses to previous interrogatories.

The judge has ordered the parties to give notice of the tentative ruling and has scheduled a hearing to consider further arguments on certain issues.
