**Tentative Ruling**

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to compel answers at deposition and to quash subpoenas. The plaintiff, Shelly Engel, seeks to compel answers at deposition and obtain sanctions due to the defendant's refusal to answer certain questions. The defendant, William S. Hart Union High School District, seeks to quash subpoenas for medical and billing records.

The court grants the plaintiff's motion to compel answers at deposition and orders the witness Donna Manfredi to appear for a second session of her deposition to answer basic foundational questions relating to her meeting with counsel prior to the deposition.

The court also grants the plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $1,050, to be paid by the defendant and its counsel.

As for the motion to quash subpoenas, the court grants the plaintiff's motion to quash the subpoenas directed to Psychiatric Alternatives and Wellness Center, Psychiatric Treatment Centers of California, Sally Lijedahl, and Kristina Whittig. The court modifies the subpoena to CVS Pharmacy to be limited to the period of October 17, 2008 to the present, and denies the motion to quash that subpoena in all other respects.

The court grants in part the plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $1,061.65, to be paid by the defendant and its counsel.
