  Case Number:  21AVCV00032    Hearing Date:   April 23, 2024    Dept:  A14 Background
 
This is a lemon law action.
Plaintiff Maricela Aguilar (“Plaintiff”) alleges that on or about August 31,
2019, she purchased a 2019 Chevrolet Colorado bearing the VIN number
1GCPTEE11K1319151 (the “Subject Vehicle”) from Antelope Valley Chevrolet, one
of Defendant General Motors, LLC (“Defendant”)’s authorized dealerships, for a
total contract price of $56,343.00. Plaintiff further alleges that (1)
Defendant gave an express bumper-to-bumper limited warranty covering 3 years or
36,000 miles whichever occurred first and an express limited warranty covering
certain powertrain components for a period of 5 years or 100,000 miles
whichever occurred first and, during the warranty period, Defendant agreed it
would, at no cost to plaintiff, repair or replace all covered parts on
plaintiffs vehicle that malfunctioned or failed under normal use during the
applicable warranty period as a result of defective materials or workmanship; (2)
on or about August 24, 2020, at or near 20,935 miles on the odometer, Plaintiff
returned the Subject Vehicle to one of Defendant’s authorized repair facility
for warranty repairs due to defects, nonconformities, and/or malfunctions consisting
of a persistent lack of power and general sluggishness as well as lubricant
leaking from the front axle area; (3) in or about November 2020, the braking
system of the Subject Vehicle malfunctioned; (4) while Defendant repaired the
defects related to lack of power and lubricant leaking from the axle, Defendant
would not diagnose, inspect, or assess the Subject Vehicle for issues related
to the braking system unless Plaintiff paid a fee in violation of the
warranties provided with the Subject Vehicle; and (5) Plaintiff called
Defendant’s customer service center after Defendant’s refusal to repair the
breaks and requested that Defendant repurchase the vehicle and Defendant
refused to do so violating the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.
 
On January 13, 2021, Plaintiff
filed her Complaint for Damages for Breach of Express and Implied Warranties,
alleging three counts of breach: (1) Breach of Express Warranty – Song-Beverly
Consumer Warranty Act; (2) Breach of Implied Warranty of Merchantability –
Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act; and (3) Breach of Warranty to Repair
Defects – Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”). 
 
On February 24, 2021, Defendant
filed its Answer to the Complaint.
 
On April 12, 2021, Bank of the West
(“BOTW”) filed a Complaint in case number 21AVCV00276. against Plaintiff
alleging four causes of action related to non-payment of the Retail Installment
Sale Contract (“RISC”) for the Subject Vehicle: (1) Breach of RISC; (2) Money
Lent; (3) Recovery of Personal Property (Claim and Deliver); and (4)
Conversion.
 
On June 30, 2021, Plaintiff filed
three documents: (1) her Answer to Bank of the West’s Complaint, (2) a
Cross-Complaint in 21AVCV00276, and (2) a Notice of Related case in this action
as to 21AVCV00276.
 
On July 02, 2021, the two cases
were deemed related. 
 
On August 13, 201, BMO filed its
First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) in 21AVCV00276.
 
On September 13, 2021, BMO filed
a Third-Party Cross-Complaint as to Defendant and Antelope Valley Chevrolet,
Inc. (“AV Chevrolet”).
 
On September 17, 2021, BMO filed
its Answer to Plaintiff’s Cross-Complaint.
 
On October 27, 2021, AV Chevrolet
filed two documents: (1) its Answer to BMO’s Cross-Complaint in 21AVCV00276,
and (2) a Cross-Complaint in 21AVCV00276 as to Defendant.
 
On November 04, 2021, Defendant filed
its Answer to BMO’s Cross-Complaint in 21AVCV00276.
 
On November 29, 2021, AV
Chevrolet filed a Second Answer to BMO’s Cross-Complaint. It appears the
difference is in whether BMO’s Cross-Complaint was verified. 
 
On the same date, Defendant filed
its Answer to AV Chevrolet’s Cross-Complaint.
 
On January 20, 2022, Defendant
filed an Amended Answer as to BMO’s Cross-Complaint in 21AVCV00276.
 
On February 16, 2023, BMO filed a
notice in change of name from “Bank of the West” to “BMO Harris Bank N.A.” due
to change in ownership. The Court is aware of this change and has been
addressing Bank of the West as “BMO” for the purpose of this Statement of
Decision due this fact. 
 
On April 10, 2023, two documents
were filed: (1) a Notice of Settlement by Plaintiff, and (2) a notice of
Settlement by BMO.
Following this, several
dismissals occurred:
 
·        
BMO dismissed its Third-Party Cross-Complaint as
to Defendant;
·        
BMO dismissed its Third-Party Cross-Complaint as
to AV Chevrolet; and
·        
AV Chevrolet dismissed its Cross-Complaint in
its entirety.
 
On February 25 2024, Plaintiff

Legal Standard
 
Standard for Attorney’s Fees – A prevailing party in entitled to recover
costs, including attorneys’ fees, as a matter of right. (See Cal. Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 1032(a)(4), 1032(b), 1033.5.)¿ 
¿ 
The fee setting inquiry in California
ordinarily begins with the “lodestar” method, i.e., the number of hours
reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate. A computation of
time spent on a case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a
determination of an appropriate attorneys’ fee award. The lodestar figure may
then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors specific to the case, in
order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services provided.
(Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49.)¿ Such an approach anchors
the trial court’s analysis to an objective determination of the value of the
attorney’s services, ensuring that the amount awarded is not arbitrary. (Id.
at 48, n.23.) After the trial court has performed the lodestar calculations, it
shall consider whether the total award so calculated under all of the
circumstances of the case is more than a reasonable amount and, if so, shall
reduce the section 1717 award so that it is a reasonable figure.¿ (PLCM
Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095-96.)¿ 
¿ 
The factors considered in determining the
modification of the lodestar include the nature and difficulty of the
litigation, the amount of money involved, the skill required and employed to
handle the case, the attention given, the success or failure, and other
circumstances in the case. (EnPalm, LLC v. Teitler Family Trust
(2008) 162 Cal. App. 4th 770, 774 (emphasis in original).) A negative modifier
was appropriate when duplicative work had been performed. (Thayer v. Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A. (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 819.)¿

Discussion
 
Application – As an
initial matter, Defendant presents that this motion is untimely as Cal. Rules
of Court 3.1702 provides 60 days after notice of entry of judgment, or 180 days
after entry of judgment, whichever is first. Defendant cites to DeSaulles v.
Community Hospital of Monterey Peninsula (2016) 62 Cal.4th 1140, 1155 (“DeSaulles”)
for support that a settlement serves as a judgment.
 
In Reply, Plaintiff presents that
Defendant’s reliance on Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1702 is misplaced because
the resolution of this case stemmed from a settlement, not a judgment and
Defendant’s reliance on DeSaulles is misplaced as Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
1032 allows a prevailing party to recover costs and the question answered by
the DeSaulles court was whether a plaintiff who voluntarily dismisses an
action after entering into a monetary settlement is a prevailing party under
section 1032 and no dismissal has been filed in this case.
 
Here, Plaintiff accepted
Defendant’s Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 998 offer which reads in pertinent part:
 
GM will also pay
Plaintiff's attorney fees, expenses. and costs in the amount of $10,000.
 
Alternatively, at
Plaintiff's election, Plaintiff's attorney's fees, expenses and costs that have
been reasonably incurred pursuant to California Civil Code § 1794(d) may be
determined by the Court via noticed motion. For purposes of any such motion, GM
will agree that Plaintiff is the prevailing Party.
 
(Decl. James S. Kostas in Support
of Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorneys Fees, Exh. A.)
 
Plaintiff, under her elected
alternative, is the prevailing party.
 
A prevailing party
who claims costs must serve and file a memorandum of costs within 15 days after
the date of service of the notice of entry of judgment or dismissal by the
clerk under Code of Civil Procedure 664.5 or the date of service of written
notice of entry of judgment or dismissal, or within 180 days after entry of
judgment, whichever is first.
 
(Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
3.1700(a)(1); see Hydratec, Inc. v. Sun Valley 260 Orchard & Vineyard
Co. (1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 924, 929 [failure to comply with time limits for
memorandum of costs constitutes waiver of claim of costs]; Douglas v. Willis
(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 287, 290 [“The time limit is mandatory and failure to
timely file and serve a cost bill may result in waiver of costs. [Citation.].”].)
 
Here, the Court record shows that
no memorandum of costs has been filed with the Court. While Plaintiff attached
a Memorandum of Costs to her papers in support of this motion, the copy
attached is not file-stamped. (See Decl. James S. Kostas in Support of
Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorneys Fees, Exh. B.) This document will be addressed
by the Court as the Attached Memorandum of Costs. The Court notes that Plaintiff
has used Judicial Council of California Form MC-010 for the Attached Memorandum
of Costs, approved for optional use, but has not provided the full document
(i.e., no page 2 out of 2, substituted by counsel for a different Proof of
Service). (See Decl. James S. Kostas in Support of Plaintiff’s Motion for
Attorneys Fees, Exh. B.) The Court further notes that the Attached Memorandum
of Costs does not have any documentation providing a basis for the requested
costs; however, "[d]ocumentation must be submitted only when a party
dissatisfied with the costs claimed in the memorandum challenges them by filing
a motion to tax costs” and the current context is such that a motion to tax
costs could not be filed as a Memorandum of Costs was not filed with the Court.

 
There is no evidence in the Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. § 998 offer that the requirement for a Memorandum of Costs had
been waived by the parties. (Decl. James S. Kostas in Support of Plaintiff’s
Motion for Attorneys Fees, Exh. A.)
 
The Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 998
offer reads, as related to dismissal:
 
Plaintiff will file
a Request for Dismissal of the entire action, with prejudice, within five
business days after receiving all payments from GM due Plaintiff and his
counsel. 
 
(Decl. James S. Kostas in Support
of Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorneys Fees, Exh. A.)
 
At this time, no Request for
Dismissal has been entered. Thus, pursuant to Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
3.1700(a)(1), no written notice of entry of judgment or dismissal or entry of
judgment has occurred. 
 
Thus, the Court must deny the
request for costs and anticipated costs without prejudice.
 
However, the court encourages the
parties to meet and confer regarding the allowable costs and come to resolution
of this issue to avoid incurring additional attorney's fees to litigate this
relatively minor matter. This is particularly true where all said attorney's
fees may be imposed on only one party.

Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Maricela Aguilar’s Motion for Award of
Attorney Fees, Litigation Costs, and Other Expenses is DENIED without
prejudice.
