 Case Number:  21AVCV00899    Hearing Date:   April 23, 2024    Dept:  A14 Background
 
This is a personal injury action. Plaintiffs
Marycruz Avila (“Marycruz”)[1] and Joanna Avila (“Joanna” and collectively
“Plaintiffs”) allege that on or about January 09, 2021, Defendants Antelope
Valley Healthcare District dba Antelope Valley Hospital (“AVHD”), Antelope
Valley Cremation Service (“AVCS”), and Halley Olsen Murphy (“Murphy” and
collectively “Defendants”) undertook and agreed to provide funeral-related
services, and to accomplish the cremation of the remains of Decedent Francisco
Avila (“Decedent”) for the benefit of Plaintiffs; however, at some point in
time between January 09, 2021 to January 23, 2021, Defendants mishandled
Decedent’s remains by releasing Decedent’s body to an unauthorized funeral
home, Doe 1, whereby  decedent’s body was embalmed and presented to a
stranger’s family for funeral services. Plaintiffs allege they were made aware
of this mishandling when on or about January 24, 2023, an agent named Joey
advised them that there was a “mix up” with Decedent’s body and that Decedent’s
body was transported to an unknown location and that they were in the process
of trying to locate the body for identification. 
 
On November 05, 2021, Plaintiffs filed their
Complaint alleging one cause of action for Negligence. 
 
On January 21, 2021, Plaintiffs filed their
First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), clarifying the Negligence causes of actions
against each defendant. Specifically, the FAC includes one cause of action for
Negligence against AVCS and Murphey and a second cause of action for Negligence
against AVHD.  
 
On March 01, 2022, AVHD filed its Answer to
the FAC.  
 
On October 06, 2022, Plaintiffs amended the
fictitious name of Doe 1 to Perez Family Funeral Home and the fictitious name
of Doe 2 Art Mortuary Transport, Inc. Both Perez Family Funeral Home and Art
Mortuary Transport are included in each Negligence cause of action. 
 
On November 21, 2022, Perez Family Funeral
Home filed its Answer to the Complaint and a Cross-Complaint alleging three
causes of action for Contribution, Indemnity, and Declaratory Relief against
AVHD. 
 
On December 23, 2022, AVHD filed its answer
to the Cross-Complaint.

SAC alleging three causes of action for: (1) Negligence against AVCS and
Murphy; (2) Negligence against AVHD; and (3) Negligence – Res Ipsa Loquitur

directed against them.

Legal Standard
 
Standard for Summary Judgment – The function of a motion for summary
judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing
party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an
order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v. Atlantic
Richfield Co.¿(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Cal. Code Civ. Proc.¿§437c(c)
“requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence
submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and
uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable
issue as to¿any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment
as a matter of law.”¿ (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)¿ “The function of the pleadings in a motion for
summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the
affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of
fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.”¿ (Juge¿v. County of
Sacramento¿(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67 (“Juge”), citing¿FPI
Development, Inc. v. Nakashima¿(1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367,
381-382.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
As to each claim as framed by the complaint,
the party moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial burden of proof
by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to establish a defense.
(Cal.¿Code Civ.¿Proc.¿§437c(p)(2);¿Scalf¿v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc.¿(2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support
of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the
evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc.¿(2006)
39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
Once the defendant has met that burden, the
burden shifts to the opposing party to show that a triable issue of one or more
material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto. To
establish a triable issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must
produce substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster v.¿Paetkau¿(1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)¿¿¿¿¿¿

Discussion
 
Evidentiary Objections
– The Court does not rule on the evidentiary objections as they are not material
to its disposition of the motions. (See Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(q).)
 
Application – Art
Mortuary Transport has been named as “Doe 2.” “Doe 2” is included in all causes
of action in the SAC and, as such, Art Mortuary Transport is included in all
causes of action. 
 
The basis for Art Mortuary
Transport’s Motion for Summary Judgment is that Art Mortuary Transport was not
a substantial factor in the causation of injury to Plaintiffs. Art Mortuary
Trasport presents that the only cause of action against it is General
Negligence. However, as discussed ante, all causes of action in the SAC
are directed against Art Mortuary Transport. 
 
The Court need not delve into a
lengthy analysis of causation as summary judgment is not appropriate as Art
Mortuary Transport does not address one of the two negligence causes of action
brought against it or the Res Ipsa Loquitur cause of action brought against it,
and, as such, fails to meet its initial burden by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to establish a
defense as to the causes of action alleged against it. 
 
Accordingly, the Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED.

Conclusion
 
Defendant Art Mortuary Transport, Inc.’s Motion for
Summary Judgment is DENIED.
