 Case Number:  23VECV02319    Hearing Date:   April 18, 2024    Dept:  T CALTON V PAYQWICK 23VECV02319
Tentative ruling on Plaintiff’s motion to quash records from University of Colorado Boulder: Grant motion to quash.  The subpoena seeks information which is protected by statute and violates her right to privacy which have not been waived by the filing of this action.  The subpoena is overbroad and seeks irrelevant documents, nor would they lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.  If documents have been or are in the future produced pursuant to this subpoena, defense counsel must immediately send the records to plaintiff’s counsel and must not keep a copy.  Any documents received from the University of Colorado Boulder may not be used in this case by the defense for any purpose.
The court is considering what to do about requested sanctions in light of the fact that Plaintiff cited to several unreported cases in violation of CRC 8.1115, which itself is a sanctionable event.
