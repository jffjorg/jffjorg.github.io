And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's request for punitive damages is granted. The plaintiff's allegations are insufficient to support punitive damages, as they do not plead specific facts to demonstrate malice, oppression, or fraud. The defendant's previous motion to strike punitive damages was granted in September 2023, and the plaintiff has not remedied the deficiency. The court finds that the plaintiff's allegations do not meet the legal requirements for punitive damages.
