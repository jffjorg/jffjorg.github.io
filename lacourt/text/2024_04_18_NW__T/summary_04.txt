And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"In this case, the plaintiff's motion to quash the defendant's subpoena seeking records from the University of Colorado Boulder is granted. The subpoena seeks protected information that violates the plaintiff's right to privacy and has not been waived by the filing of this action. The subpoena is also overbroad and seeks irrelevant documents that would not lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The court orders that any documents received from the University of Colorado Boulder must be sent to the plaintiff's counsel and cannot be kept by the defense. Additionally, the court notes that the plaintiff cited unreported cases in violation of California Rules of Court, Rule 8.1115, which is a sanctionable event. The court will consider what to do about requested sanctions in this regard."
