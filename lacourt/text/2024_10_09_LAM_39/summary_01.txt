And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Richard Dixon (Judgment Creditor) v. PrettyBoyFredo, LLC (Judgment Debtor) regarding a motion for an order assigning the Judgment Debtor's rights of payments from Alphabet, Inc., Google, LLC, and YouTube, LLC. The Judgment Creditor obtained a judgment against the Judgment Debtor in the case of Dixon v. Villa, et al. in 2020, and is now seeking to assign the Judgment Debtor's rights of payments to satisfy the judgment. The Judgment Debtor has not opposed the motion, and therefore, the Court has granted the motion and assigned the Judgment Debtor's rights of payments to the Judgment Creditor. The Court has discretion to determine the amount of the assignment based on factors such as the reasonable economic needs of the Judgment Debtor, other payments the Judgment Debtor is required to make, the amount remaining due on the monetary judgment, and the amount to be received in satisfaction of the right to payment that is to be assigned.
