And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed Defendant's motion to strike portions of the complaint, specifically the punitive damages allegations. The court finds that Plaintiff has not stated a valid claim for punitive damages. The court notes that Plaintiff's allegations do not support an award of punitive damages against Defendant, as the driver of the semi-truck that collided with Plaintiff's vehicle fled the scene of the accident, but Plaintiff does not allege that he sustained further injuries because of this. The court also finds that Plaintiff must amend to plead a valid entitlement to punitive damages, as the allegations do not implicate the malice of Defendant's corporate leaders.

The court grants Defendant's motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages against Defendant, with leave to amend. Plaintiff is ordered to file an amended complaint within 10 days, and Defendant is ordered to provide notice of this order and file proof of service of same.
