And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the applications of attorneys Nicole Mary Catherine Arata and Sara Catherine Clark to appear as counsel pro hac vice on behalf of plaintiff/cross-defendant Santos Laguna, S.A. de C.V. The judge has also granted defendant's motion to seal certain records that contain confidential medical information about potential witnesses.

The judge has denied plaintiff Santos Laguna, S.A. de C.V.'s motion for "clarification" of the court's orders on motions for summary judgment and summary adjudication, as well as plaintiff's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. The judge has ruled that clarifying the court's orders is not necessary to establish a clear record for appeal, as an appellate court will review the trial court's decision de novo and is not bound by the trial court's stated reasons or rationales.

The judge has also denied plaintiff's request for a further explanation of the court's order, stating that the court did its best in the limited time it had to write the order and that the court's language could have been more artfully stated. The judge has noted that it has not adjudicated plaintiff's breach of contract cause of action and that the jury will render a verdict on that claim.

Finally, the judge has ruled that the records defendants move to seal concern the health conditions of some potential witnesses in this case and that the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored to protect their privacy rights.
