 Case Number:  22STCV37114    Hearing Date:   October 30, 2023    Dept:  52 Plaintiff David Monge’s Motion to
Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production
Plaintiff David Monge moves to
compel further responses to requests for production, set one, Nos. 7, 9, 11-31,
34, and 40-67.  A requesting party may
move to compel further responses if “[a] statement of compliance with the
demand is incomplete,” “[a] representation of inability to comply is
inadequate, incomplete, or evasive,” or “[a]n objection in the response is
without merit or too general.”  (CCP §
2031.310(a).)
Timeliness
Defendant Volkswagen Group of
America, Inc. argues plaintiff’s motion is untimely as to request Nos. 9,
12-26, 34, 46-54, 58-61.  The requesting
party must move to compel further responses “within 45 days of the service of
the verified response.”  (CCP §
2031.310(c).)  Plaintiff filed this
motion within 45 days of defendant’s verification, but defendant argues the
motion is untimely as to these requests because defendant responded only with
objections.  
The motion is timely as to all
requests.  Code of Civil Procedure
section 2031.250(a) provides, “The party to whom the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling is directed shall sign the response under oath
unless the response contains only objections.” 
Subdivision (c) of that section provides, “The attorney for the
responding party shall sign any responses that contain an objection.”  
These requirements do not apply
separately to each individual numbered category within a demand for inspection.  The Civil Discovery Act contemplates a
singular “response” to a “demand” containing separately numbered “item[s] or
category[ies] in the demand” and response. 
(CCP § 2031.210(c); accord § 2031.280(a) [“documents produced in
response to a demand … shall be identified with the specific request number to
which the documents respond”].)  Neither
responding parties nor their attorneys need to sign 67 times when responding to
a demand for production of 67 categories of documents.  Defendant’s response gave substantive answers
to many of the categories.  Its
“response” thus does not contain “only objections” under section 2031.250(c).  “[T]he responses [must] be verified because
they were a combination of responses and objections.  And because they had to be verified, the
clock did not begin running until they were.” 
(Golf & Tennis Pro Shop, Inc. v. Superior Court (2022)
84 Cal.App.5th 127, 136.)
Mootness
Defendant argues the motion is moot
as to request Nos. 7, 40-45, and 57 because they produced the requested
documents.  (Opp., p. 3.)  Plaintiff moves to compel further written
responses to the requests for production (CCP § 2031.310), not only to compel
production of documents in compliance with the responding party’s “statement of
compliance” (§ 2031.320(a)).  Defendant
presents evidence only that it produced additional documents.  (Davenport Decl., ¶ 9, Ex. G.)  It provides no evidence that it served supplemental
written responses to the requests.  Producing
documents alone is insufficient because plaintiff is entitled to code-compliant
responses to the requests themselves.  
Nos. 11, 16-26, 34, 60, and 61
Request Nos. 11, 16-26, 34, 60, and
61 do not “reasonably particulariz[e] each category of item” as required.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.030(c)(1).)  These requests incorporate plaintiff’s
definition of “DEFECT(S)” as “concerns presented to Defendant and its authorized service and repair
facilities by owners/lessors of SIMILAR VEHICLES for diagnosis and repair, and
which are evidenced within the repair history of SUBJECT VEHICLE and/or its
component parts, including but not limited to: engine, transmission, abnormal
hard shifting, crankshaft position sensor defects, persistent intake
malfunction defects, HVAC system, and electrical system defects.”  Not only does this request refer to seven
different types of defects, but it also provides that it is “not limited to”
those defects.  As a result, the requests
incorporating this definition are boundless. 
Defendant cannot reasonably respond to them.  
Defendant’s objections to request
Nos. 11, 16-26,
34, 60, and 61 are sustained.
Nos. 12-16, 20-23, 27-31, 41-47, and 61-67
These requests also do not
“reasonably particulariz[e] each category of item” as required.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.030(c)(1).)        Nos. 12-15 and 61 request “All DOCUMENTS,
including but not limited to electronically stored information and electronic
mails, concerning, referring, or relating to” various topics.  Nos. 16 and 20-23 request “All DOCUMENTS,
including but not limited to electronically stored information and electronic
mails, concerning or relating in any way to any decision to modify” specified
parts of the vehicle.  Nos. 27-31 request
“All DOCUMENTS which refer to, reflect, or relate to” various topics.  Nos. 41-45 and 62-67 request, “All DOCUMENTS
which evidence, describe, refer, or relate to” various topics.  No. 46 requests, “All DOCUMENTS, including but not limited to
electronically stored information and electronic mails, from 2018 to the
present, concerning or relating to all SIMILAR VEHICLES which were repurchased
or replaced by YOU pursuant to the Song-Beverly Act.”
Requesting documents that concern, refer,
relate, reflect, evidence, or describe these categories obfuscates what
plaintiff demands.  It is unclear what
these requests include.  For example, plaintiff did not simply ask for the
“technical service bulletin[s]” themselves in No. 27.  For No. 46, documents “concerning or relating
to all” similar vehicles defendant repurchased could include everything from
consumers’ receipts, the repair
histories of the repurchased vehicles, consumers’ written requests for
repurchase, or any number of other types of documents.  These requests are so broad that defendant
cannot reasonably respond.
No. 47,
meanwhile, requests “All Vehicle Warranty History Reports for the repurchased
or replaced SIMILAR VEHICLES identified in YOUR response to the preceding
request.”  Because this request relies on
No. 46, defendant cannot reasonably respond to it either.  
Defendant’s
objections to Nos. 12-16, 20-23, 27-31, 41-47, and 61-67 are sustained.
Nos. 7, 9, 40, and 48-59
Plaintiff
shows good cause to compel further responses to these requests.  They ask for documents about defendant’s
general policies, training, and third-party dispute resolution efforts related
to the Song-Beverly Act (Nos. 7, 40, 48-57), manuals about diagnosing and
repairing 2017 Volkswagen CC vehicles (No. 9), and publications to the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration (Nos. 58 and 59).
These requests are reasonably calculated to lead to
the discovery of admissible evidence.  Information
about a manufacturer’s policies and practices regarding repurchases based on
similar consumer complaints may show willfulness.  (Oregel v. American Isuzu Motors, Inc. (2001)
90 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1105 [“evidence that Isuzu adopted internal policies that
erected hidden obstacles to the ability of an unwary consumer to obtain redress
under the Act” was admissible for willfulness].)  Evidence about purported defects or
repurchases in an entire class of vehicles may support plaintiff’s claims.  (See Donlen v. Ford Motor Co. (2013)
217 Cal.App.4th 138, 154 [testimony about the transmission model used in a wide
range of vehicles, including plaintiff’s, was admissible]; Santana v. FCA
US, LLC (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 334, 346-347 [manufacturer’s internal
emails about problems in class of vehicles supported jury’s finding of willful
violation].)  
Defendant does not justify its other objections to
these requests.  Defendant’s objections
to Nos. 7, 9, 40, and 48-59 are overruled.

Disposition
            Plaintiff
David Monge’s motion to compel further responses to requests for production is denied as to request Nos. 11-31, 34, 41-47, and
60-67.  
Plaintiff David Monge’s motion to
compel further responses to requests for production is granted as to request Nos. 7, 9, 40, and 48-59.  Defendant Volkswagen Group of America, Inc. is
ordered to provide further verified responses without
objections to requests for production Nos. 7, 9, 40, and 48-59.  Defendant shall produce any additional
responsive documents concurrently with its written responses.
