And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the Defendant's motion to compel discovery, ordering the Plaintiff to serve verified responses to the Defendant's discovery requests within 30 days. The Plaintiff is also ordered to pay two additional filing fees. Additionally, the Judge has imposed sanctions of $2,685.00 on the Plaintiff's counsel, who must pay the sanctions within 30 days. The Plaintiff's failure to serve timely responses to discovery requests has waived any objections to the requests, and the Defendant's motion was granted because the Plaintiff did not file an opposition to the motion. The Judge has also noted that the Plaintiff's motion to compel discovery should have been filed as a separate motion for each category of discovery.
