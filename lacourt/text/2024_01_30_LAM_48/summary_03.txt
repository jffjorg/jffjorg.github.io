And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has tentatively granted in part and denied in part KLS Financial LLC's motion to compel further responses to interrogatories propounded by Infinity Plumbing Inc. The court has ordered Infinity to provide further responses to special interrogatories Nos. 1-4, 11, and 5-6 without objections within 30 days. However, the court has denied the motion to compel further responses to interrogatory No. 10, which asks for two distinct responses. The court has also denied the request for sanctions.
