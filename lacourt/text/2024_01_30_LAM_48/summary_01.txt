And here is the English text summary:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling to sustain the demurrer of the defendants to the second, third, and fourth causes of action in the case. The demurrer was filed in response to the third amended complaint, which alleged that the defendants engaged in a secret and fraudulent sale of property to hinder the plaintiffs' collection of a judgment against the defendants in a prior personal injury case. The Judge found that the plaintiffs did not plead sufficient facts to state a claim for accounting, intentional infliction of emotional distress, or negligent infliction of emotional distress. The Judge also found that the plaintiffs did not allege a relationship or involvement with the defendants that would require an accounting, and that the defendants' alleged conduct was not extreme or outrageous. The Judge ordered the defendants to file an answer to the remaining first cause of action within 10 days.
