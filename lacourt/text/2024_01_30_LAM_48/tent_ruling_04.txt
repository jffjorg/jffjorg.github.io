  CASE NO.: 23STCV04121
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER DISMISSING ACTION
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
January 30, 2024



 
On
December 21, 2023, the Court sustained Defendant’s demurrer to the claims of the
California Plaintiffs: Alejandra Montano, Aaron Alaniz, Carlos Romero, Marcos Montano,
Justin Willis, Gabriel Venegas, Aaron Castillo, Steve Santos, Meghan Caldwell, Keyshia
Littleton, Trenton Lee Earnhardt, and OM Jagg. 
The Court determined that, as a matter of law, Plaintiffs could not state
claims for intentional interference with contractual relations and unfair competition.  Ther Court therefore denied leave to amend and
ordered the in-state Defendants dismissed without prejudice.
The
Court also set a briefing schedule and Order to Show Cause for dismissal of the
remaining action (maintained by the non-California Plaintiffs) based on Code of
Civil Procedure section 436, subdivision (b).
The
parties timely filed opening briefs.  Defendant
timely filed its reply brief.  Plaintiffs
did not file a reply brief.
The
non-California Plaintiffs argue only that “[t]]he Court’s OSC and proposed motion
to strike exceed the proper bounds of a motion to strike.”  (Plaintiffs’ Brief at p. 3.)  They contend that “a motion to strike pursuant
to Section 436(b) is not a proper vehicle to extend the effect of T-Mobile’s Demurrer.”  (Id. at p. 4.)
“The
court may, . . .  at any time in its discretion,
and upon terms it deems proper . . . Strike out all or any part of any pleading
not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an
order of the court.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
436, subd. (b).)  A complaint that fails to
state facts constituting a cause of action is “not drawn in conformity with the
laws of this state and [is] thus properly subject to the court’s own motion to strike
under section 436, subdivision (b).”  (Lodi
v. Lodi (1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 628, 631.)
Plaintiffs
Tommy Campbell, Ana Linayo Del Sol, Kevin Salazar, Matthew Wolpert, Steven Marcangelo,
Velinda Valentin, Scott Brady, James Cavanagh, Antonio Herrera, Justin Bright, Luis
Quintana, Saxon Butcher, and Alexander Boucher do not reside in California.  (Complaint ¶¶ 1-10, 12-14.)  However, their claims are indistinguishable from
the now-dismissed California Plaintiffs’ claims.  (See generally Complaint.)
The
Court’s reasoning in its December 21, 2023 order—finding that the causes of action
do not state a claim—applies equally to the non-California Plaintiffs.  Because the non-California Plaintiffs do not state
a claim, the Court will strike their pleading under section 436, subdivision (b).
The
Complaint filed on February 23, 2023 is STRICKEN.
Plaintiffs
Tommy Campbell, Ana Linayo Del Sol, Kevin Salazar, Matthew Wolpert, Steven Marcangelo,
Velinda Valentin, Scott Brady, James Cavanagh, Antonio Herrera, Justin Bright, Luis
Quintana, Saxon Butcher, and Alexander Boucher are DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.
This
action is DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
