And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted a motion for approval of payment of attorney fees in the amount of $225,000.00. The payment is in connection with a settlement agreement between the Receiver, Byron Z. Moldo, and Loeb and Loeb, LLP, in which Loeb agreed to pay the Receiver $450,000.00 and withdraw a claim. The fee agreement between the Receiver and the law firm, Litvak, was unclear on how to compensate for the savings achieved through the withdrawal of the claim. After negotiations, the parties agreed on the amount of $225,000.00, which is 40% of the recovery and 5% of the savings. The motion was unopposed, and the judge finds the amount reasonable.
