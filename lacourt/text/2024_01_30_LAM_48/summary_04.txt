And here is the English-text summary:

Judge Thomas D. Long has issued a tentative ruling dismissing the action with prejudice. The ruling follows the Court's previous decision sustaining the demurrer to the claims of the California Plaintiffs. The non-California Plaintiffs argue that the Court's Order to Show Cause and motion to strike exceed the proper bounds of a motion to strike. However, the Court finds that the non-California Plaintiffs do not state a claim, as the causes of action do not state a claim. The Court will strike the pleading under Code of Civil Procedure section 436, subdivision (b). The non-California Plaintiffs are dismissed with prejudice. The action is also dismissed with prejudice.
