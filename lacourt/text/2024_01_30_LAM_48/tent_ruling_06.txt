  CASE NO.: BC579623
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR APPROVAL
  OF PAYMENT OF ATTORNEY FEES
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
January 30, 2024



 
On
August 8, 2018, the Court approved Receiver Byron Z. Moldo retaining Dapeer, Rosenblit
& Litvak, LLP (“Litvak”) for litigation against the law firm Loeb and Loeb,
LLP (“Loeb”) for professional negligence and breach of fiduciary duty in Loeb’s
prior representation of the Sage Entities in the Receivership Estate.
On
May 3, 2022, the Receiver and Loeb participated in a mediation and were able to
reach a settlement in which Loeb agreed to pay the Receiver $450,000.00 and withdraw
the Loeb Claim in the Receivership.  (Moldo
Decl. ¶¶ 12-13.)
The
Fee Agreement between the Receiver and Litvak provided that in addition to being
paid a $50,000.00 nonrefundable retainer, Litvak would be paid a contingency fee
of 40% of any recovery in the action.  (Moldo
Decl. ¶ 9 & Ex. C.)  The Fee Agreement
was unclear as to compensation for the withdrawal of the Loeb Claim, which resulted
in substantial savings to the Receivership Estate.  (Moldo Decl. ¶ 15.)  Saving money does not constitute collecting or
receiving money, and even if it did, Litvak and the Receiver agreed that a 40% contingency
fee is too high.  (Moldo Decl. ¶ 16.)  After negotiating the matter, the Receiver and
Litvak agreed that Litvak will receive $225,000.00 total for legal services provided
regarding the Loeb claim—40% of the $450,000.00 recovery, as well as approximately
5% of the savings from the withdrawal of the Loeb Claim.  (Moldo Decl. ¶ 17.)
On
December 19, 2023, the Receiver moved for approval of the payment of attorney fees.
The
amount of attorney fees is reasonable in light of the retainer agreement and the
uncertainty of how to compensate for the savings achieved through dismissal of the
Loeb Claim.  Additionally, no party opposed
the motion.
The
motion for order approving payment of attorney fees is GRANTED.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
