And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion for a new trial and granting the plaintiff's motion to tax costs. The plaintiff had sought a new trial due to alleged irregularities in the proceedings, including the exclusion of a declaration and interview statements. However, the judge found that the plaintiff did not demonstrate how the exclusion of these items was an irregularity in the proceedings or how it affected the outcome of the trial.

The judge also denied the plaintiff's motion to disqualify the defendants' counsel's firm due to an alleged conflict of interest. The judge found that the plaintiff had not shown that the former attorney's employment with the defendants' counsel's firm had resulted in any confidential information being used or disclosed.

Regarding the motion to tax costs, the judge granted the plaintiff's motion and ordered that the defendants not recover their costs in the action. The judge found that the defendants had not distinguished the costs incurred for the non-FEHA claims from the costs incurred for the FEHA claims, and that the express public policy of the FEHA exception controls, requiring that only costs properly allocated to non-FEHA claims be recoverable.
