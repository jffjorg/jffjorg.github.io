And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motions to add certain individuals and entities as alter egos of the defendant without prejudice. The motions were filed to add Andrew Faour, Zain Diab, and Liquorama as alter egos of the defendant, but the judge found that the motions did not comply with California Rules of Court (CRC) and Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) requirements. The judge noted that the plaintiffs failed to provide a proposed amendment to their complaint and did not adequately analyze the alter ego doctrine. The judge also found that the motions were untimely and did not provide sufficient evidence to support the requests to add the new parties. The case will proceed without the new parties.
