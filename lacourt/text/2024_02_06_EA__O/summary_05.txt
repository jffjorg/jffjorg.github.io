And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motions filed by the three plaintiffs to add certain individuals and entities as alter egos of the defendant. The motions were filed to amend the complaints to include the alter egos, alleging that they were directly involved in the alleged wrongful conduct. The judge found that the motions did not comply with the California Rules of Court and the Code of Civil Procedure, and therefore denied them without prejudice. The judge noted that the plaintiffs failed to provide a proposed amendment, did not specify when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered, and did not explain why the request for amendment was not made earlier. The judge also found that the plaintiffs' opposition to the defendant's contention that the alter ego doctrine does not apply was lacking in analysis and failed to address the defendant's arguments.
