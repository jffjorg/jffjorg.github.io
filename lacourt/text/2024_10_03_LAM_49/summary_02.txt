And here is the English text summary:

The judge, Randolph M. Hammock, has issued a tentative ruling in the case 24STCV07456, which was brought by plaintiff Misty Richardson against defendants City of Covina Community Development Department and Catholic Charities of Los Angeles. The case involves claims of disability discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.

Plaintiff was late to appear at three consecutive Case Management Conferences, which led to the dismissal of the action. However, plaintiff now moves to set aside the dismissal under CCP section 473(b), which allows the court to relieve a party from a judgment or dismissal due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.

The court finds that plaintiff's failure to appear was due to her providing care for a disabled member of her household and that she attempted to give notice of a delay in her arrival to the courts. The court grants plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal and orders a new Case Management Conference for January 2, 2025. The court admonishes plaintiff to make necessary arrangements to timely appear at future hearings and warns that failure to do so will result in dismissal of the action.
