And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike or tax costs brought by the defendant, Jeff Lotman. The motion was granted in part and denied in part. The court found that the plaintiff, JD Classics Limited, was entitled to recover some of its costs, including filing and motion fees, deposition costs, and service of process costs. However, the court taxed some of the costs, including a portion of the court reporter fees and the laundry service expense. The court also found that the plaintiff was entitled to recover its other costs, including technology technician fees, in full. The judge noted that the court intends to declare the plaintiff as the "prevailing party" in this case, which would allow it to claim recoverable costs under California Code of Civil Procedure sections 1032(a)(4) and 1033.5.
