And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant, Los Angeles Unified School District, is entitled to compel the plaintiff, R.V., to provide further responses to certain requests for production of documents and interrogatories. The requests in question relate to the plaintiff's claims of sexual assault and abuse by a former employee of the district.

The judge found that the plaintiff's objections to the requests were meritorious, meaning they were valid and justified. The judge also found that the plaintiff's responses to certain requests were incomplete and did not fully answer the questions asked.

As a result, the judge granted the defendant's motion to compel further responses to the requests in part. The plaintiff is now required to provide additional information and answers to the requests, which may further reveal the details of the plaintiff's claims and the defendant's alleged failures to prevent the abuse.
