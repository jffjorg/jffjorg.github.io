And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case between Reza Veiseh, the Plaintiff, and Encino Oaks Homeowners Association, the Defendant. The case involves allegations that the Homeowners Association failed to make repairs to the Plaintiff's common area and unit, resulting in mold growth. The Defendant moved to set aside the entry of default and/or default judgment, arguing that they did not have notice of the lawsuit until after a default had been entered and that their failure to file a timely responsive pleading was due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.

The Judge has granted the Defendant's motion, finding that the Defendant's failure to file a timely responsive pleading was indeed due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The Judge notes that the Defendant's General Manager relied on a representation from corporate counsel that the insurance carrier had already been notified of the lawsuit, and that the insurance carrier did not learn about the lawsuit until June 18, 2024. The Judge concludes that granting relief will not prejudice the Plaintiff and that the Defendant has shown that they have a meritorious defense.

The Judge orders the Defendant to file an answer within 10 days.
