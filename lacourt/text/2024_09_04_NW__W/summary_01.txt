Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied Defendant Robert Brard's motion for a new trial. The motion was filed after the court granted summary judgment in favor of Plaintiff NPI Debt Funds I, LP. The Defendant argued that the award of damages was excessive and that the decision was contrary to law. However, the Judge found that the Defendant's arguments were not supported by evidence and that the motion was untimely. The Judge also found that the Defendant failed to demonstrate that the guaranty was a sham or that the interest rate was usurious. The Judge has denied the motion for new trial and has confirmed the summary judgment in favor of the Plaintiff.
