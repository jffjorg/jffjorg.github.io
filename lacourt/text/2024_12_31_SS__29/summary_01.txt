And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to continue the trial date. The motion was filed on November 22, 2024, and the judge has concluded that there is good cause to continue the trial. The trial was originally set for February 20, 2025, but will now be continued to a date on or after May 23, 2025. The judge has also reset the final status conference and all discovery deadlines based on the new trial date. The judge notes that the parties have already completed a significant amount of discovery, including the subpoenas of plaintiffs' medical records, a site inspection, and the depositions of all parties. The defendants seek a continuance so that they may file a summary judgment motion and to allow for independent medical examinations of the plaintiffs. The judge has considered all the facts and circumstances relevant to the determination and has found that the continuance is necessary in the interests of justice.
