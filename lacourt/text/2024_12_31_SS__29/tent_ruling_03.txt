Background
On July 14, 2022, Plaintiff Edward Mkhchyan (“Plaintiff”)
filed the complaint in this action against Jerome’s Furniture Warehouse, Fleet
Logic, LLC, Alex Trucks, LLC, William Edgardo Rivas Perez, and Does 1 through
50, asserting causes of action for motor vehicle negligence and general
negligence arising out of an alleged accident on August 21, 2020, at or near
the intersection of Torrance Boulevard and Maple Avenue in Torrance.
On August 25, 2022, Defendants Alex Trucks, LLC and William
Edgardo Rivas Perez filed an answer to the complaint.
On August 26, 2022, Defendant Jerome’s Furniture Warehouse
filed an answer to the complaint and a cross-complaint against Diakon
Logistics, LLC, Alex Trucks, LLC, William Edgardo Rivas Perez, and Roes 1
through 50.
On October 13, 2022, Defendant Fleet Logic, LLC dba Velocity
Truck Rental and Leasing filed an answer to the complaint.
On December 7, 2022, Cross-Defendant Diakon Logistics
(Delaware) Inc., erroneously sued as Diakon Logistics, LLC (“Diakon”), filed an
answer to the cross-complaint of Jerome’s Furniture Warehouse and a
cross-complaint against Alex Trucks, LLC, William Edgardo Rivas Perez, and Roes
1 through 50.
On March 15, 2024, Plaintiff amended the complaint to name
Diakon as Doe 1.  Diakon filed an answer to the complaint on July 9,
2024.
As it relates to the matter set for hearing on December 31,
2024, Plaintiff filed this motion on November 13, 2024, for an order deeming
Defendant Alex Trucks, LLC (“Defendant”) to have admitted the truth of the
mattes specified in Requests for Admission (Set Two).  In the motion,
Plaintiff also seeks sanctions.
Defendant filed an opposition on December 16.  Plaintiff
filed a reply on December 20.
Legal Standard
A party must respond to requests for admission within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom
requests for admission are directed does not provide a timely response, the
propounding party “may move for an order that … the truth of [the] matters
specified in the requests be deemed admitted.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for such a motion, and no
meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2033.280; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to
provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).)
The court “shall” make the order that the truth of the matters
specified in the request be deemed admitted unless the court “finds that the
party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before
the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission
that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction
under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or
both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission
necessitated this motion [to deem admitted the truth of the matters specified
in the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the
discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has
engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary
sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees,
incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030,
subd. (a).)
“[P]roviding untimely responses does not divest the trial
court of its authority [to hear a motion to compel responses].”  (Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p.
407.)  Even if the untimely response “does not contain objections
[and] substantially resolve[s] the issues raised by a motion to compel
responses … the trial court retains the authority to hear the motion.” (Id.
at pp. 408-409.) This rule gives “an important incentive for parties to
respond to discovery in a timely fashion.” (Id. at p. 408.) If “the
propounding party [does not] take the motion off calendar or narrow its scope
to the issue of sanctions,” the trial court may “deny the motion to
compel responses as essentially unnecessary, in whole or in part, and just impose
sanctions.” (Id. at p. 409.) “The court may award sanctions under
the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery,
even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion
was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party
after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).) 
Discussion
Plaintiff served Defendant with requests for admission on
October 3, 2023.  (Ayvazyan Decl. ¶ 3 & Exh. 1.)  More
than a year later, when Plaintiff still had not received any responses from
Defendant, Plaintiff filed this motion for a deemed-admitted order.
In opposition, Defendant’s primary argument is that it is
diligently working on the response and it anticipates serving the responses
before the hearing..  That, of course, is not a sufficient answer to
the motion.  Plaintiff is entitled to responses, not promises of
responses to come in the future.
Defendant’s counsel also states that counsel will “file a
declaration with the verified responses attached before the motion hearing.”  (Park Decl., ¶ 3.)  No such declaration has been received by the
Court.
The motion is granted.
The request for sanctions is denied.  The notice of
motion seeks sanctions against a different party – who of course cannot be
sanctioned for the failure of Defendant to respond to
discovery.   
The request is granted in part.  Defendant’s failure to serve a timely
response to the requests for admission necessitated the filing of this motion.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)  In light of the relatively
straightforward nature of this motion, and the economies of scale associated
with preparing multiple discovery motions in the same case, the Court sets
sanctions in the amount of $585, calculated based on 1.5 hours of attorney time
for this motion, multiplied by counsel’s reasonable billing rate of $350 per
motion, plus a $60 filing fee.  (See Ayvazyan Decl., ¶¶ 6-9.)
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion for a deemed-admitted
order.
The Court ORDERS that Defendant Alex Trucks, LLC IS DEEMED TO
HAVE ADMITTED THE TRUTH of the matters specified in Plaintiff’s Requests for
Admission (Set Two).
The Court GRANTS IN PART Plaintiff’s requests for monetary
sanctions.
The Court ORDERS Defendant Alex Trucks, LLC and counsel of
record Ford Walker Haggerty & Behar LLP, jointly and severally, to pay
monetary sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act to Plaintiff (through counsel)
in the amount of $585 within 30 days of notice.
Moving party to give notice.
