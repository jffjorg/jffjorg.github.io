TENTATIVE
RULING
 



DEPT:


32




HEARING DATE:


February
  23, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


22STCV09525




MOTIONS:  


Requests
  for Admission, Set One Deemed Admitted  




MOVING PARTY:


Plaintiff Jalen Goins 




OPPOSING PARTY:


Defendant
  Michael Verna



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
            Plaintiff Jalen Goins (Plaintiff)
moves to have Request for Admissions, Set One Deemed Admitted against Defendant
Michael Verna (Defendant). Plaintiff also seeks monetary sanctions. Defendant
opposes.[1]
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
Where there has
been no timely response to a request for admission under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction.¿ (Code of Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)¿ The party who failed to respond waives any
objections to the demand, unless the court grants that party relief from the
waiver, upon a showing that the party (1) has subsequently served a
substantially compliant response, and (2) that the party’s failure to respond
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.¿ (Code of Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subds. (a)(1)-(2).)¿ The court “shall” grant a motion to
deem admitted requests for admissions, “unless it finds that the party to whom
the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on
the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in
substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”¿ (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (c).)¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
The Discovery
Act does not define “substantial compliance” in the context of service of a
proposed response that complies with Code Civ. Proc., section 2033.220. The
courts have ruled that “substantial compliance” means actual compliance with
all matters of substance and that technical deviations are not to be given the
stature of noncompliance. (St. Mary v. Superior Court (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th
762, 779.) For example, unverified responses are not in substantial compliance.
(Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.) Additionally, RFA
responses must be examined in their entirety. (St. Mary v. Superior Court
(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 780.)¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿ 
Where a party
fails to provide a timely response to requests for admission, “[i]t is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”¿
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)¿¿ 
 
DISCUSSION
 
The motion is untimely. The proof of service shows that notice of this
motion was served electronically. Code of Civil Procedure section 1005
requires “written notice” of a motion including the date, time and location of
the hearing on a motion. A moving party’s failure to serve the notice of motion
and moving papers on a non-moving party violates the basic principles of
procedural due process under the federal and state constitutions – notice and
an opportunity to be heard.¿ (Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co. (1982) 455
U.S. 422, 428 [minimum due process requires notice and opportunity for hearing
appropriate to the nature of the case]; Horn v. County of Ventura (1979)
24 Cal.3d 605, 612 [due process principles require reasonable notice and
opportunity to be heard].) 
 
Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 1005(b), moving papers must be served and filed
at least 16 court days before the hearing. Applying this, 16 court days before
the current hearing was January 30, 2024. Additionally, if notice is served
electronically, the 16-day notice period is increased by two-court days. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 1010.6(a).) Therefore, notice of this motion was due January 26,
2024 (two court days before January 30, 2024). According to the proof of
service, Plaintiff served this motion electronically on January 30, 2024.
Therefore, because notice was not provided within the minimum timeline provided
by section 1005, the motion is procedurally defective. 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to have Request for Admissions, Set
One Deemed Admitted, is denied without prejudice as procedurally defective.
 
Plaintiff
to provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
