Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by Cartage West, Inc. to file a cross-complaint against Andy Frain Services, Inc., which is the employer of the plaintiff, Michael Greenwood. The plaintiff was physically assaulted by Fermin Antonio Mazariego Jr. and is seeking damages from Cartage West, Inc. for negligence and negligent hiring and supervision. Cartage West, Inc. argues that Andy Frain Services, Inc. contributed to the plaintiff's injuries and that the interests of justice permit it to file the cross-complaint.

The judge notes that the plaintiff argues that Difko Admin. (US) Inc. v. Superior Court (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 126 prohibits a cross-complaint against an employer, but the judge finds that this case is distinguishable because Andy Frain Services, Inc. allegedly exceeded the risks inherent in the employment relationship and therefore is not covered by worker's compensation.

The judge also finds that Cartage West, Inc. was not dilatory in filing the motion, and grants leave to file the cross-complaint in the interest of justice. The judge orders Cartage West, Inc. to file and serve its proposed cross-complaint within 10 days of the date of the order.
