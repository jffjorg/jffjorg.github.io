The Judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant Lyft, Inc.'s motion to compel arbitration and stay all judicial proceedings pending the completion of arbitration. The motion is based on the agreement to arbitrate between Lyft and Plaintiff Jose Luis Gutierrez, which was made through a clickwrap agreement on the Lyft App. The Judge finds that Lyft has met its burden to show that there was a valid agreement, and that the agreement covers the present controversy. The matter is set for an Order to Show Cause Re Dismissal Due to Completion of Arbitration for August 19, 2024.
