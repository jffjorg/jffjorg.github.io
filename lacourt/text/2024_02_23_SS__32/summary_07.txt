And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to have Request for Admissions, Set One Deemed Admitted, as procedurally defective. The motion was served electronically on January 30, 2024, but notice was not provided within the minimum 16-court-day timeline. The court finds that the plaintiff failed to provide notice and proof of service within the required timeframe, violating the basic principles of procedural due process. Therefore, the motion is denied without prejudice, and the plaintiff is ordered to provide notice and file a proof of service.
