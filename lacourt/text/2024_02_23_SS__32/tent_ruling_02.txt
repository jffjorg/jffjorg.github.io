TENTATIVE
RULING
 



DEPT:


32




HEARING DATE:


February
  23, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


20STCV34363




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  to be Relieved as Counsel




MOVING PARTY:


Plaintiff Dana Foster’s Counsel




OPPOSING PARTY:


None



 
BACKGROUND
 
            Plaintiff
Dana Foster’s (Plaintiff) counsel of
record, Nina Sargsyan (Counsel), moves to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff.
Counsel contends relief is necessary because there has been a breakdown of the
attorney-client relationship.
 
            No
opposition has been filed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
To be granted relief as counsel, counsel must comply with California
Rules of Court (CRC) 3.1362. Even where grounds for termination exist,
attorneys seeking to withdraw must comply with the procedures set forth in
California Rule of Professional Conduct (CRPC) 3.700 and are subject to
discipline for failure to do so. CRPC 3.700(B) lists various grounds for
mandatory withdrawal. 
 
An attorney's right to terminate the attorney-client relationship and
withdraw from a case is not absolute. (See Vann v. Shilleh (1975) 54
Cal.App.3d 192, 197; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398.) The
decision whether to grant or deny an application for withdrawal is within the
court's discretion, and it does not abuse that discretion by denying the
application on the ground that the attorney's withdrawal would work injustice
upon a third party. (Hodcarriers, Bldg. and Common Laborers Local Union No.
89 v. Miller (1966) 243 Cal.App.2d 391.)
 
The rules have been liberally construed to protect clients. (Vann
v. Shilleh, supra, 54 Cal.App.3d 192.) An attorney, either with client's
consent or court's approval, may withdraw from a case when withdrawal can be
accomplished without undue prejudice to client's interests; however, an
attorney “shall not withdraw from employment until the member has taken
reasonable steps to avoid reasonably foreseeable prejudice to the rights of the
client, including giving due notice to the client, allowing time for employment
of other counsel, complying with rule 3-700(D), and complying with applicable
laws and rules.” (CRPC 3.700(A)(2).) A lawyer violates his or her ethical
mandate by abandoning a client (Pineda v. State Bar (1989) 49 Cal.3d
753, 758 759), or by withdrawing at a critical point and thereby prejudicing
the client’s case. (CRPC 3.700(A)(2); Vann v. Shilleh, supra.)
 
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Counsel has
filed forms MC-051 and MC-052 and has lodged with the Court a copy of the
proposed order on form MC-053 as required. 
(Cal Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.) 
Counsel states the instant motion is filed for the following reason: “This
motion is based upon the grounds that there has been an irremediable breakdown
in the attorney-client relationship that stands in the way of effective
representation. Plaintiffs attorneys no longer have the trust of Plaintiff that
would allow them to make legal decisions. Plaintiffs attorneys will nonetheless
attempt to have the instant Motion to be Relieved served upon Plaintiff.” (MC-052.)
The Court
finds that this is a valid reason for withdrawal. (See Rules Prof. Conduct,
rule 1.16.)   
 
However, Counsel has not included the dates, times,
locations, and subject matter of all future proceedings in this case. Moreover,
the declaration of counsel does not indicate that counsel has confirmed
Plaintiff’s address within the last 30 days.
 
            Accordingly,
the Court denies the motion without prejudice.
 
            Moving
party is to give notice and file a proof of service of such.
