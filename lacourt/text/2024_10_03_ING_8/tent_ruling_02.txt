operated the Superior Grocers pursuant to a commercial lease with One Imperial
Plaza, LP (“One Imperial”), which owned the property. Plaintiff Cynthia Booze
(“Plaintiff”) is the mother and purported heir of Decedent Gordy Nnamdi Aniako
(“Decedent.”) Plaintiff has sued SCC, One Imperial, and others for Negligence,
Wrongful Death, Respondeat Superior Liability, and Negligent Hiring/Retention
in connection with the incident. SCC has filed an Answer denying all liability.

¿II. ANALYSIS¿ 
¿ 
A.   
Legal
Standard ¿ 
 
Motion to Compel
Further
 
            ¿ Discovery
motions to compel further responses must be served within 45 days after service
of the responses in question (extended if served by mail, overnight delivery,
or fax).  (CCP §§ 2030.300, 2031.310, 2033.290; CCP § 1013.) Otherwise,
the demanding party waives the right to compel any further response. (CCP §§
2030.300(c), 2031.310(c), 2033.290(c), 2016.050; see Sperber v.
Robinson (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 736, 745.) The 45day time limit is mandatory
and jurisdictional. (Sexton v. Sup.Ct. (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403,
1410.) However, the parties can also agree in writing on a specific later date
by which to file the motion to compel. (CCP §§ 2030.300(c), 2031.310(c),
2033.290(c).) Any
motion involving the content of a discovery request or the responses to such a
request shall be accompanied by a separate statement providing all information
necessary to understand each discovery request and all the responses at issue.
(CRC § 3.1345(a),(c).) 
 
Motion to Compel Initial 
 
            A party must respond to
interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260,
subd. (a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed does not provide
timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order compelling responses
to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) The party also
waives the right to make any objections, including one based on privilege or
work-product protection. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) There is no
time limit for a motion to compel responses to interrogatories other than the
cut-off on hearing discovery motions 15 days before trial. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2024.020, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., 2030.290.) No meet and confer efforts are
required before filing a motion to compel responses to the discovery. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific
Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.)¿ ¿¿ 
 
Sanctions 
 
            Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court may
impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery process includes
failing to respond or submit to an authorized method of discovery. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)¿¿¿ ¿ 
 
B.   
Discussion  
 
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set One 
 
Meet and Confer
            
            Before bringing a motion to compel further
responses to any discovery request, the moving party must make efforts to meet
and confer in good faith and submit a declaration attesting to those efforts.
(CCP §§ 2031.310(b)(2), 2030.300(b), 2033.290(b).) 
 
            On or about July 19, 2024, counsel
for SCC agreed to give Plaintiff until July 26, 2024 to respond to SCC’s
meet-and-confer letter, including serving further responses to SCC’s Special
Interrogatories, Set One and Form Interrogatories, Set One. Plaintiff’s counsel
also agreed to extend SCC’s time to file discovery deadlines by one week.
(Young Dec. at ¶ 11; Exh. I.)  Subsequently, counsel for SCC and Plaintiff
exchanged multiple phone calls and emails in which SCC granted Plaintiff a
series of extensions to provide further responses. Plaintiff did not respond to
SCC’s meet-and-confer letter or request any additional extensions by July 26,
2024.
            
            Thus, the meet and confer
requirement has been satisfied. 
 
45-Day Time Limit 
 
Notice of a motion to compel further responses must be
given within 45 days of service of the verified response, or on or before any
specific later date to which the parties have agreed in writing. (CCP §§
2030.300(c), 2033.290(c).) If such notice is not given, the propounding party
waives any right to compel a further response. (Id.)  
 
            Here, on May 29, 2024,
Plaintiff served initial responses to SCC’s “Set One” Special Interrogatories.
(Young Dec., at ¶ 8, Exh. F.) Defendant filed the motion on August 5, 2024, and made
service of the motion by mail on the same day. (Motion, p. 9,  Proof of
Service.) However, the parties agreed to multiple extensions up to July 26,
2024. Accordingly, Plaintiff had notice of the motion within the time limit,
and Defendant has complied with the notice requirement. 
 
Merits
¿
            Here, on March 8, 2024, SCC
electronically served its “Set One” written discovery on Plaintiff. This
included a set of Form Interrogatories, Set One and Special
Interrogatories,  Set One. (Young Decl.
at ¶ 2; Exh. A.) Plaintiff’s “Set One” discovery responses to SCC were
initially due on or before April 9, 2024. Plaintiff did not serve any discovery
responses on or before that date, nor did Plaintiff request an extension of
time to respond. (Young Decl. ¶ 3.)
 
            On May 29, 2024, Plaintiff served
initial responses to SCC’s “Set One” Special Interrogatories. (Young Dec., at ¶
8, Exh. F.) On June 27, 2024, counsel for SCC emailed Plaintiff’s counsel a
meet-and-confer letter regarding discovery. Among other things, the letter
demanded that Plaintiff serve further responses to SCC’s Special
Interrogatories Nos. 7-18, 25-27, 31-36, 43-45, 61- 66, 78, 81, 83, 85-86,
106-107, 116, 118-119, 123-124, and 126. The letter demanded a response by no
later than Monday, July 8, 2024. (Young Dec., at ¶ 9, Exhs. G-H.)  To date, Plaintiff has never served any
further or supplemental responses to SCC’s Special Interrogatories, Set One.
(Young Dec. at ¶ 12.) Notably, no oppositions were filed. 
 
            Thus, the Court grants the Motion to
Compel Plaintiff’s Further Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One. 
 
Motion to Compel
Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One 
            
            Here, on March 8, 2024, SCC
electronically served its “Set One” written discovery on Plaintiff. This
included a set of Form Interrogatories, Set One and Special
Interrogatories,  Set One. (Young Decl.
at ¶ 2; Exh. A.) Plaintiff’s “Set One” discovery responses to SCC were
initially due on or before April 9, 2024. Plaintiff did not serve any discovery
responses on or before that date, nor did Plaintiff request an extension of
time to respond. (Young Decl. ¶ 3.)  To
date, Plaintiff has never served any responses to SCC’s Form Interrogatories,
Set One. (Young Decl. at ¶ 14.) Notably, no oppositions were filed.
 
            Thus, the Court grants the Motion to
Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One. 
 
Sanctions 
 
            SCC moves this Court for costs,
attorney’s fees, and monetary sanctions against Plaintiff in the sum of
$1,060.00 for the Motion to Compel Initial Responses to Form Interrogatories,
Set One. SCC also seeks monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,560.00 based
upon the attorney’s fees and filing fees incurred in bringing this Motion to
Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One. (Young Decl, ¶
13.) 
 
            Code of Civil Procedure Section
2023.010(d) provides that failure to respond or to submit to an authorized
method of discovery (such as Defendant’s Form Interrogatories, Set One) is a
“misuse of the discovery process.” The propounding party’s remedy is to file a
motion for an Order compelling responses to the interrogatories. (C.C.P. §
2030.290.) If the motion is granted, the Court may order that the party to whom
the interrogatories were directed pay the propounding party’s reasonable
expenses, including attorney’s fees. (C.C.P. § 2023.030.) Reasonable expenses
include the time moving party’s counsel spent in research and preparation of
the motion and court time in connection with the motion. (See Ghanooni v.
Super Shuttle (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 256, 262.)
 
            Here, sanctions are warranted
because Plaintiff failed to respond at all to the form interrogatories and failed
to respond to the meet and confer requests as to deficiencies in the considerably
tardy responses to the special interrogatories. 
The Court grants sanctions in the combined amount of $1,500 plus $120
for both filing fees) for a total of $1,620, payable withing 30 days by
plaintiff or Plaintiff’s counsel to the law offices of the moving defendant.
