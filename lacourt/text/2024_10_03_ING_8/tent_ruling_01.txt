I. BACKGROUND
A.    Factual
¿ On March 1, 2023, Plaintiff Alejandro Banuelos
(Plaintiff) filed a complaint against Defendants Kia Forum, KROQ-FM, Audacy
California, LLC, and Does 1 through 25. On April 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed an
amendment to the complaint for a fictitious name, erroneously listing Doe 1’s
correct name as Defendant ABM Services, Inc. On June 30, 2023, ABM Industry
Groups, LLC (Defendant) filed its answer to Plaintiff’s complaint.
On March 28, 2024, Defendant ABM filed a motion for summary
judgment against Plaintiff. Plaintiff’s motion was granted on July 30, 2024.
On August 13, 2024, upon entry of judgment, Defendant filed
its memorandum of costs in a Form MC-010, signed and dated by Defendant’s
counsel Aydin Emami. Defendant lists $10,007.62 in costs, including: 
(1) Item 1, filing and motion fees, $196.60;

(2) Item 5, service of process, $325.00; 
(3) Item 11, court reporter fees as
established by statute, $3,784.50; 
(4) Item 14, fees for electronic filing, $534.30;

(5) Item 15, fees for hosting electronic
documents, $1,181.02; and 
(6) Item 16, other, $3,986.20.
B.    ¿ Procedural
Plaintiff filed the
instant motion to tax costs on August 28, 2024. 
On September 19, 2024, Defendant filed its opposition, and Plaintiff
filed his reply on September 25, 2024.
¿II. ANALYSIS
A.   
Legal Standard 
“Except as otherwise expressly
provided by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to
recover costs in any action or proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1032(b).) A
prevailing party is defined to include “a defendant in whose favor a dismissal
is entered.” (Code Civ. Proc. §1032(a)(4); Perko's Enterprises, Inc. v. RRNS
Enterprises (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 238, 242.) Most costs are obtained by
filing a memorandum of costs or incorporated into the judgment. (Lucky
United Props. Inc. v. Lee (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 125, 137.) Costs a
prevailing party is permitted to recover under section 1032 include, in
relevant part: (1) filing, motion, and jury fees, (2) deposition costs, (3)
service of process fees, (4) court reporter fees, and (5) electronic filing
fees. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(a).) The court also has discretion to allow
items not mentioned in the statute. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(c)(4).)
A party challenging the amounts
claimed may file a motion to tax costs, which must be served and filed 15 days
after service of the cost memorandum. (Cal. Rules of Court., rule 3.1700(b)(1),
8.278(c)(2).) “Unless objection is made to the entire cost memorandum, the
motion . . . must refer to each item objected to by the same number and appear
in the same order as the corresponding cost item claimed on the memorandum of
costs and must state why the item is objectionable.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1700(b)(2).) 
“In ruling upon a motion to tax costs,
the trial court's first determination is whether the statute expressly allows
the particular item and whether it appears proper on its face. If so, the
burden is on the objecting party to show the costs to be unnecessary or unreasonable.”
(Foothill De Anza Cmty. College Dist. v. Emerich (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th
11, 2930.) “Whether a cost item was reasonably necessary to the litigation
presents a question of fact for the trial court.” (Ladas v. Cal. State Auto.
Assn. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774.)  
B.   
Discussion 
Plaintiff challenges
each of Defendant’s claimed costs in its Memorandum of Costs, Form MC-010.
Plaintiff asserts that Defendant failed to establish the reasonable necessity
for the costs it claims in the Form MC-010 because it failed to concurrently
file a Form MC-011, where Defendant should have identified and provided the
basis for the costs it requests. Thus, Plaintiff asserts that even if
Defendant’s claimed costs are “allowable as a matter of right[,]” the Court
must strike them because Plaintiff has failed to establish that they were “reasonably
necessary to conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or
beneficial to its preparation. (Perko’s Enterprises, supra, 4
Cal.App.4th at 244-45.)  Plaintiff also
asserts in the Reply that because of the income or wealth disparity of the
parties, it should decline to award costs because ABM can afford them but
Plaintiff cannot.  But this is not a FEHA
case, and it was the Plaintiff’s decision to add ABM as a defendant after another
defendant named ABM as a cross-defendant.
Plaintiff further contends
that each of Defendant’s claimed costs are not allowable under the law: (1) for
Item 5, Defendant failed to show that the service of process was performed by
any of the listed means under § 1033.5(a)(4), or evidence of the purported
service; (2) for Item 11, Defendant cannot recover the costs for electronic
filing or service pursuant to § 1033.5(a)(14) because it failed to show that
the Court issued an order or requirement to do so; (3) for Item 15, Defendant
cannot recover the costs for hosting electronic documents pursuant to §
1033.5(a)(15) because it failed to show that the Court issued an order or
requirement to do so; (4) for “other” costs in Item 16, Defendant failed to
stated what the costs were for and, therefore, failed to prove it is reasonable
in need and amount.
Here, some of the
costs claimed by Defendant are taxable but most are not.
A “verified
memorandum of costs is prima facie evidence of the propriety of the items
listed on it, and the burden is on the party challenging these costs to
demonstrate that they were not reasonable or necessary.”  (Adams v.
Ford Motor Co. (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 1475, 1486; 612 South LLC v.
Laconic Limited Partnership (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1270, 1285.) 
“There is no requirement that copies of bills, invoices, statements, or any
other such documents be attached to the memorandum.  Only if the costs
have been put in issue via a motion to tax costs must supporting documentation
be submitted.”  (Jones v. Dumrichob (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th
1258, 1267.) Therefore, Defendant’s Form MC-010, coupled with the supporting
declaration of defense counsel, is sufficient evidence to establish a prima
facie case that for the propriety of the costs listed on it.
Further, Plaintiff’s
asserted challenges to Defendant’s five claimed costs fail to establish that
they were not reasonably necessary to the conduct of Defendant’s litigation.
First, the $325 fee for service of process is allowable under § 1033.5(a)(4).
Upon Plaintiff’s challenge, Defendant presented sufficient evidence to
establish that the fee was related to service of process effectuated by a Cal
Express, a registered process server, and that the was reasonably necessary for
Defendant’s defense. (Pendergrass Decl. ¶ 6.)  Plaintiff’s reply wonders WHO was served with
the use of a process server when all parties had already appeared in the case
when ABM was added as a cross-defendant and later as a defendant after all
parties had already appeared.  Absent
further proof at oral argument and in the absence of an invoice to aid in answering
the Reply’s legitimate question, the Court tentatively denies the $325 process
server cost claimed.
Second, the
$3,780.50 of fees for court reporters are allowable under § 1033.5(a)(3), which
permits recovery of the costs to record and transcribe deposition testimony. Defendant
presented sufficient evidence to establish that the court reporter fees were
related to the deposition of Defendant Forum’s person most knowledgeable, and
for deposition expenses for the Plaintiff and for witness depositions many of which
were cited in ABM’s successful MSJ. (Pendergrass Decl. ¶ 7, Ex. C.)   The Court finds that the transcript costs were
reasonably necessary for Defendant because they provided facts pertinent to a
successful defense, and many of which were cited in the successful MSJ in this case,
but that the cost of obtaining the video of the Kia Forum PMK’s deposition should
be taxed.  At oral argument counsel can
address the amount of the video. 
Third, the $534.30
for electronic filing fees are allowable under § 1033.5(a)(14), which permits
recovery of such fees when done subject to court order. As noted by Defendant, the
Los Angeles Superior Court has maintained a standing order regarding mandatory  electronic filing for civil suits since 2018.
Fourth, the $1,181.02
of fees for hosting electronic documents is claimed to be allowable in the
court’s discretion because ABM’s counsel asserts they were reasonably necessary
to Defendant’s defense. The Reply asserts that the costs of hosting medical
record documents was not reasonably incurred because plaintiff agreed to
provide copies of his medical records with his discovery responses so the cost
of also obtaining digital versions of the voluminous records that various
parties obtained by SDT was not reasonably necessary.  However, a party is entitled to obtain copies
of subpoenaed records especially where the records are voluminous, as a check
to ensure that records provided by plaintiff are complete and properly authenticated.  A party does not know when it obtains medical
records that its intended dispositive motion will be granted, nor that other
parties in the case will not settle out leaving it as the sole remaining
defendant in a high-damages case where it may need to defend against the reasonable
value claimed for the medical care and treatment.  Under § 1033.5(c) and established case law,
an “item neither specifically allowable under C.C.P. §1033.5(a) nor prohibited
under § 1033.5(b) may nevertheless be recoverable in the court's discretion.” (Ladas
v. California State Auto. Ass'n (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761; Ripley v.
Pappadopoulos (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1616; Science Applications Internat.
Corp. v. Sup. Ct. (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1095, 1103.) Here, Defendant established
that it incurred these fees as a necessary result of the volume of records
involved in this case. (Pendergrass ¶ 10.) Therefore, Defendant successfully
established that these fees were reasonably necessary to its defense.
Finally, the $3,986.20
in costs Defendant claims in the “other” category are largely recoverable. Here,
Defendant has presented sufficient evidence to establish that these costs are
separated in two distinct categories: (1) $2,990.00 in fees related to the
costs of transcripts of the depositions of Plaintiff, Plaintiff’s brother, and
Defendant Forum’s responding security officer (Pendergrass Decl., ¶ 8; Ex. D)
and; (2) $801 in fees related to issuing subpoenas to Plaintiff’s medical
providers (Pendergrass Decl., ¶ 11; Ex. F). The court is satisfied that both
categories of costs were reasonably necessary to Defendant’s litigation, other
than the video of the Kia Forum PMK.  First,
although Defendant improperly listed the costs for additional depositions in
the “other” category, separate from the other depositions, they costs are no
less allowable under § 1033.5(a)(3). The costs of these depositions were also
reasonably necessary to Defendant’s successful defense as discussed above.  
Accordingly, the
Court will tax the cost of the video of the Kia Forum PMK and the $375 in service
of process costs.

CONCLUSION
            For the foregoing reasons,
Plaintiff’s Motion to Tax Costs is DENIED in part and GRANTED in part.
