And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Alejandro Banuelos' motion to tax costs claimed by Defendant ABM Industry Groups, LLC. The Defendant had filed a memorandum of costs, which listed $10,007.62 in costs, including filing and motion fees, service of process, court reporter fees, electronic filing fees, and other costs. The Plaintiff challenged each of these costs, arguing that they were not reasonably necessary to the litigation.

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion to tax costs in part and granted it in part. The Judge has allowed some of the Defendant's claimed costs, including $325 for service of process, $3,780.50 for court reporter fees, $534.30 for electronic filing fees, and $2,990.00 for transcripts of depositions. The Judge has also allowed some of the costs in the "other" category, including $801 for issuing subpoenas to Plaintiff's medical providers.

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion to tax costs for other costs, including the cost of hosting electronic documents, citing a lack of evidence to support the reasonableness of these costs. The Judge has also denied the Defendant's claim for the cost of a video of the Kia Forum PMK's deposition, citing a lack of evidence to support the necessity of this cost.

The Judge has ordered that the Defendant's memorandum of costs be taxed, with the costs noted above being allowed, and the costs noted above being denied. The Judge has also ordered that the Plaintiff be given notice of the tentative ruling.
