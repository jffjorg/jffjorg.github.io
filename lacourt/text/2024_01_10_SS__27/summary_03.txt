And here is the English-text to summarize this judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling regarding Defendant's motion to reopen discovery for the limited purpose of completing expert depositions. The Court finds that the meet and confer requirement has been met, despite Plaintiff's counsel's position that a sufficient meet and confer did not take place. The Court is dismayed at the number of continuances that have occurred in this case, but finds that there should be no prejudice and no need to change the trial date. Therefore, the Court grants the motion to reopen discovery and orders the completion of expert depositions.
