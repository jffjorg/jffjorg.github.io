I.                  
INTRODUCTION
On November 26, 2019, plaintiff Richard Harris
(“Plaintiff”) initiated this action against defendants Park La Brea LLC and
Universal Protection Service LP (erroneously sued as “Allied Universal”). 
On February 14, 2023, Defendant Universal
Protection Service LP (hereinafter “Defendant”) filed various motions to compel
verified responses to Set One of Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories,
and Request for Production of Documents from Plaintiff. On October 27, 2023,
the Court granted Defendant’s motions to compel and ordered Plaintiff to
provide verified responses without objections to these discovery requests by
November 13, 2023. 
Now, Defendant has filed the instant motion for
terminating sanctions based on Plaintiff’s failure to abide by the Court’s
October 27, 2023 Order. No opposition has been filed. 
II.               
LEGAL STANDARD
If a party fails to comply with a court order
compelling a response to interrogatories or a request for production, the court
may impose monetary, issue, evidence, or terminating sanctions.  (Code
Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c).)  California Code
of Civil Procedure § 2023.030 provides that, “[t]o the extent authorized by the
chapter governing any particular discovery method . . . , the court, after
notice to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for
hearing, may impose . . . [monetary, issue, evidence, or terminating] sanctions
against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process .
. . .”  California Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010 provides that
“[m]issues of the discovery process include, but are not limited to, the
following: . . . (d) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of
discovery. . . . (g) Disobeying a court order to provide discovery . . .
.” 
The purpose of terminating sanctions is to
ensure compliance with the discovery statutes and orders of the court; they are
not intended to be punitive in nature.  (Welgoss v. End (1967)
252 Cal.App.2d 982, 992; Rail Services of America v. State Comp. Ins.
Fund (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 323, 331-332.)  Discovery sanctions
are not a tool for litigating factual issues, and a motion for a discovery
sanction is not a means of adjudicating the merits of a cause of action.
Compliance with the discovery statutes is the goal, and to that end any
discovery sanction issued by the court should be tailored to any noncompliant
conduct.  (See Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 531, 564; New Albertsons, Inc. v. Superior Court (2008)
168 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1423-1426; Lopez v. Watchtower Bible and Tract
Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566, 604-605.)
III.            
DISCUSSION
Here, Defendant moves for terminating sanctions
based on Plaintiff’s willful failure to comply with the Court’s October 27,
2023 Order. (Motion at pg. 7; Johnson Decl. ¶ 11-12, Exh. D.) 
“The trial court may order a terminating
sanction for discovery abuse ‘after considering the totality of the
circumstances: [the] conduct of the party to determine if the actions were
willful; the detriment to the propounding party; and the number of formal and
informal attempts to obtain the discovery.’”  (Los Defensores, Inc. v.
Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390 (quoting Lang v. Hochman
(2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246).)  “Generally, ‘[a] decision to order
terminating sanctions should not be made lightly.  But where a violation
is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the
trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.’”  (Los
Defensores, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390 (citation
omitted).) 
“Under this standard, trial courts have
properly imposed terminating sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed
one or more discovery orders.”  (Ibid. (citing Lang, supra,
77 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1244-1246); see, e.g., Collisson & Kaplan v.
Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622 (terminating sanctions
imposed after defendants failed to comply with one court order to produce
discovery); Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991) 231
Cal.App.3d 481, 491 (disapproved on other grounds in Garcia v. McCutchen
(1997) 16 Cal.4th 469, 478, n. 4) (terminating sanctions imposed against
plaintiff for failing to comply with a discovery order and for violating
various discovery statutes).) 
Under the circumstances, the Court finds that
terminating sanctions are warranted. Defendant has repeatedly attempted to
procure discovery responses from Plaintiff to no avail. Even after being
ordered by the Court to provide code-compliant discovery responses and having
received notice of the order, Plaintiff has continued to disregard his
discovery obligations. (See Johnson Decl. ¶¶ 11-12, Exh. D.) It is also noted that Plaintiff has failed to
file an opposition to explain why he has been unable to comply with the Court’s
October 27, 2023 order. Thus,
because of Plaintiff’s lack of diligence, the Court finds that
Plaintiff has engaged in conduct that constitutes a misuse of the discovery
process by disobeying the Court’s October 27, 2023 order to serve verified
discovery responses without objections.
(Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 787 [“Lack of diligence may
be deemed willful in the sense that the party understood his obligation, had
the ability to comply, and failed to comply.”]) 
Moreover, considering trial is set for May 21, 2024
and the trial date has been continued twice before, Defendant has been
prejudiced by not receiving discovery in this action that would be vital for its
defense. Therefore, because Plaintiff has failed to respond to Defendant’s
written discovery requests in spite of a court order, and, further, Plaintiff
has not opposed the terminating sanctions request, the Court finds that lesser
sanctions would not curb this abuse, and as a result, terminating sanctions are
appropriate. (Jerry's Shell v. Equilon Enterprises, LLC (2005) 134
Cal.App.4th 1058, 1069.)
Accordingly, the Court grants Defendant’s motion for
terminating sanctions.
IV.            
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Defendant Universal
Protection Service LP’s Motion for Terminating Sanction is GRANTED.
Consequently, the Court dismisses the action as it pertains to Defendant Universal
Protection Service LP only.
