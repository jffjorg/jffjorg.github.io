 COLONIAL INN DISCOVERY
On June 10, 2019, Plaintiffs Luciana Littlewolf
and Jazmin Alejandra Littlewolf filed this action against Defendants Colonial
Inn, 534 East Foothill LLC, Hamid Hamedi, erroneously sued as Hamid Hamin, and
Does 1 through 20 (collectively “Defendants”) for injuries allegedly arising
from bedbug bites during their stay at Defendants’ hotel.  On June 27, 2023, Plaintiff
Luciana Littlewolf (“Plaintiff”) served Form Interrogatories, Set One, Request
for Production of Documents, Set One, and Request for Admissions, Set One on
Defendant Colonial Inn (“Defendant”).  Having received no responses, Plaintiff proceeded to file the motions to
compel Defendant to provide responses and to deem the RFAs admitted.  Plaintiff also requests monetary sanctions.  No opposition to the motions have been filed.
Compel
Responses
Where
a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may
make an order compelling responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290,
2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)  A party that fails to
serve timely responses waives any objections to the request, including ones
based on privilege or the protection of attorney work product.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a),
2031.300, subd. (a).)  Unlike a motion to compel further responses,
a motion to compel responses is not subject to a 45-day time limit and the
propounding party has no meet and confer obligations.  (Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 404.)
Here, on June 27, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel
served Form Interrogatories, Set One, on
Defendant.  (Declarations of Shelan Toma, ¶5; Ex. “A.”)  To date, Defendant has
not provided discovery responses, despite being granted numerous
extensions.  (Id. at ¶¶5-8.)  Therefore,
Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s responses to Form Interrogatories, Set
One and Request for Production of Documents, Set One, are GRANTED.  Defendant
is ordered to provide responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One and Request
for Production of Documents, Set One, without objection, within 30 days of this
order.
Deem Admitted
Where a party fails to
timely respond to a request for admission, the propounding party may move for
an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters
specified in the requests be deemed admitted.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subd. (b).)  The party who failed to respond waives any
objections to the demand, unless the court grants them relief from the waiver,
upon a showing that the party (1) has subsequently served a substantially
compliant response, and (2) that the party’s failure to respond was the result
of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subds. (a)(1)-(2).)  The court shall grant a motion to deem
admitted requests for admissions, “unless it finds that the party to whom the
requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the
motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in
substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subd. (c).)
Here, on June 27, 2023,
Plaintiff’s counsel served Request for
Admissions, Set One, on Defendant.  (Declaration of Shelan
Toma, ¶5; Ex. “A.”)  To date, Defendant has not provided
discovery responses, despite being granted numerous extensions.  (Id. at ¶¶5-8.)  Therefore,
Plaintiff’s motion to deem the Requests for Admissions, Set One, admitted is
granted and the Requests are hereby ordered admitted.
Monetary
Sanctions
Where the court grants a
motion to compel responses, sanctions shall be imposed against the party who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel, unless the party acted with
substantial justification, or the sanction would otherwise be
unjust.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c).)  Under California Rules of Court, rule 3.1348,
subdivision (a), “[t]he court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in
favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no
opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn,
or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion
was filed.”  For requests for admission, monetary sanctions are
mandatory.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (c).)
Here, Plaintiff requests
sanctions in the amount of $2,100.00 for 7 hours incurred at Plaintiff’s
counsel’s hourly rate of $300.00 for each motion.  Plaintiff’s request for
sanctions is GRANTED in a reduced amount because the motions are
straightforward, unopposed, and nearly identical to one another. 
Sanctions are imposed against Defendant and counsel of record, jointly and
severally, in the total amount of $3000, to be paid within 30 days of the date
of this Order.HAMEDI DISCOVERYOn June 10, 2019, Plaintiffs Luciana Littlewolf
and Jazmin Alejandra Littlewolf filed this action against Defendants Colonial

Luciana Littlewolf (“Plaintiff”) served Form Interrogatories, Set One on

request for sanctions is GRANTED in a reduced amount because the motion is
straightforward, unopposed, and nearly identical to the other discovery motions
against Defendant Colonial Inn filed simultaneously with this motion. 
Sanctions are imposed against Defendant and counsel of record, jointly and
severally, in the total amount of $1000, to be paid within 30 days of the date
of this Order.
