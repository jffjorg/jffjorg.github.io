The court has reviewed the motions filed by Plaintiff Luciana Littlewolf to compel Defendant Colonial Inn's responses to discovery requests, including Form Interrogatories, Set One, Request for Production of Documents, Set One, and Request for Admissions, Set One. The court finds that Defendant has failed to respond to these requests despite extensions and grants Plaintiff's motions to compel responses. The court also grants Plaintiff's motion to deem the Requests for Admissions, Set One, admitted.

Furthermore, the court imposes sanctions against Defendant and counsel of record in the amount of $3000 for their failure to respond to discovery requests. The court also grants Plaintiff's request for sanctions in a reduced amount of $1000.

The court orders Defendant to provide responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One and Request for Production of Documents, Set One, within 30 days of this order. The court also orders Plaintiff to provide notice to all parties.

Unless all parties submit on this tentative ruling and there are no appearances at the hearing, the court may adopt the tentative as the final order or place the motion off calendar.
