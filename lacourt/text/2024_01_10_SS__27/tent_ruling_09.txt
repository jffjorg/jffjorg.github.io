TENTATIVE
The Motion to be Relieved as Counsel
submitted by Plaintiff’s counsel is GRANTED.
 

Background
            On
February 18, 2022, Natalie Moore (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Melkon
Chamichyan (“Defendant”) for injuries suffered after a motor vehicle collision.
Plaintiff’s attorney now files a Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel.
 
Discussion
 
Legal Standard
            An application to be relieved as
counsel must be made on Judicial Counsel Form MC-051
(Notice
of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052
(Declaration)
(Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule
3.1362(e)).
The proposed order must specify all hearing dates scheduled in the action or
proceeding,
including the date of trial, if known. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).)
 
            Further, the requisite forms must be
served on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay the effective date of the order
relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client
has been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) A motion
to withdraw will not be granted where withdrawal would prejudice the client. (Ramirez
v. Sturdevant (1994), 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)
 
Analysis
            Here,
Plaintiff’s counsel has filed both Judicial Counsel Forms MC-051 and MC-052.
The MC-052 form lists the remaining scheduled hearing dates, including a final
status conference on March 7, 2024, and the currently scheduled trial date of
March 21, 2024. Proof of service to the client is included, and Plaintiff’s
counsel has specified a break down in the attorney-client relationship as the
cause for the Motion. As all requirements have been met, the Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel is granted.       
 
Conclusion
            The
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel submitted by Plaintiff’s counsel is GRANTED,
effective upon Notice of this ruling being provided to Plaintiff.
 
 
 
Moving party is ordered to give Notice.
