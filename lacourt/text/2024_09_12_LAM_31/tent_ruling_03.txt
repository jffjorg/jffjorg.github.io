MOTIONS
TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO DISCOVERY



 
MOVING PARTY:                   Defendant
Stephen Snyder
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Marvin Fetalino,
as Trustee of the MF Hero Trust
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            This is a contractual fraud case concerning the residential
property located at 3327 Ione Drive, Los Angeles, CA (the “Property”).  On June 23, 2023, Plaintiff, Marvin Fetalino,
as trustee of the MF Hero Trust, filed a Verified Complaint against Defendants Stephen
Snyder (“Snyder” or “Defendant”)[1]
and 3327 Ione, LLC (“Ione”), for (1) Breach of Contract, (2) Intentional
Misrepresentation, (3) Fraudulent Concealment, (4) Negligent Misrepresentation,
(5) Breach of Fiduciary Duty, and (6) Declaratory Relief.  Snyder is self-represented.
 
On July 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed these motions to compel
Snyder’s responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request
for Production of Documents, Set One.  Plaintiff requests sanctions against Snyder.[2]
 
Snyder filed late oppositions.[3]  Plaintiff filed replies. 
 
II.        LEGAL
STANDARD
            
            Under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.300 and
2031.310, parties may move for a further response to interrogatories and
requests for production of documents  where an answer to the requests are
evasive or incomplete or where an objection is without merit or too general.¿ A
motion to compel further response to requests for production “shall set forth
specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the
inspection demand.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1).)¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
Notice of the motions must be given within 45 days of
service of the verified response, otherwise, the propounding party waives any
right to compel a further response.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (c);
2031.310, subd. (c).)¿ The motions must also be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (b)(1); 2031.310,
subd. (b)(2).)¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
Finally, Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345 requires that all
motions or responses involving further discovery contain a separate statement
with the text of each request, the response, and a statement of factual and
legal reasons for compelling further responses.¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(a)(3).)¿¿ 
 
Monetary Sanctions¿¿¿ 
¿ 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 is a general
statute authorizing the Court to impose discovery sanctions for “misuse of the
discovery process,” which includes (without limitation) a variety of conduct
such as: making, without substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection
to discovery; making an evasive response to discovery; and unsuccessfully and
without substantial justification making or opposing a motion to compel or
limit discovery.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.)¿¿¿¿ 
¿ 
If sanctions are sought, Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.040 requires that the notice specify the identity of the person against
whom sanctions are sought and the type of sanction requested, that the motion
be supported in the points and authorities, and the facts be set forth in a
declaration supporting the amount of any monetary sanction.¿¿¿ 
¿ 
If the court finds that a party has unsuccessfully made or
opposed a motion to compel responses to interrogatories or inspection demands,
the court “shall impose a monetary sanction . . . unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.310, subd. (h).)¿¿¿¿¿ 
 
III.       JUDICIAL
NOTICE
 
            Plaintiff’s request for judicial notice is GRANTED.
 
IV.       DISCUSSION 
 
            Plaintiff
seeks Defendant’s further response to Form Interrogatories (“FROG”) Nos. 1.0,
2.1-2.8, 2.11-2.13, 4.1, 4.2, 8.1-8.8, 9.1, 9.2, 12,1-12.7, 13.1, 13.2, 14.1,
14.2, 16.1, 16.2, 16.6-16.10, 50.1-50.6, and Request for Production of
Documents (“RFP”) Nos. 1-10.
 
            In
response, Defendant provided general objections to the foregoing discovery requests.
and boilerplate objections based on overbreadth, ambiguity, and invasion of
privacy interests, both of Defendant and third-party individuals.  
 
The court has reviewed the foregoing discovery
requests.  Defendant’s objections lack
merit. The at-issue discovery requests are sufficiently clear and
particularized for Defendant to provide a substantive response.  Additionally, Defendant does not explain or
show how his privacy rights or the privacy rights of third parties are
implicated.  Further responses are warranted.
 
Monetary Sanctions
 
The court finds that Defendant did not have substantial
justification to oppose these motions. 
Plaintiff propounded Judicial Council FROGs seeking basic
information.  Yet Plaintiff asserted
meritless objections and proceeded to oppose the motion compelling his further
responses to the FROGs.  Plaintiff’s
objection-only responses and opposition to the motion to compel re: RFPs fare
no better.  
 
Accordingly, monetary sanctions are imposed against
Defendant in the sum of $1,045.90, consisting of two hours at plaintiff’s
counsel’s hourly rate and $245.90 in filing fees.
 
V.           CONCLUSION
 
            Plaintiff’s
motions are GRANTED.  Defendant is
ordered to provide further responses to the at-issue discovery requests within
30 days of this order.
 
            Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions is GRANTED. 
Defendant is ordered to pay $1,045.90 in monetary sanctions to
Plaintiff, by and through his counsel, within 30 days of this order.
 
            Plaintiff
to give notice.
