MOTIONS
TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL



 
MOVING PARTY:               Claudia
Borsutzki, Friedman & Chapman
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
            
            On June 27,
2024, Claudia Borsutzki, counsel for Plaintiffs Patrick Cassie Strickland, Thomas
Johnson, Joanne Ramirez, and Jessie Ramirez (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed these
Motions to Be Relieved as Counsel. 
 
The Motions are unopposed. 
 
II.        LEGAL
STANDARD
 
            California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel) requires (1) notice
of motion and motion to be directed to the client (made on the Notice of Motion
and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration
stating in general terms and without compromising the confidentiality of the
attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section
284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under Code of Civil Procedure
section 284(1) (made on the Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-052)); (3) service of the notice of motion
and motion and declaration on all other parties who have appeared in the case;
and (4) the proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting
Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)).¿¿ 
 
The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw,
and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the
client, and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice.¿ (See Ramirez
v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)¿ 
 
 
III.       DISCUSSION
 
            Claudi Borsutzki seeks to be relieved as counsel of record
for Plaintiffs for the following reasons: “[Plaintiffs are] a client of our
firm.  However, [they have] become
unresponsive. [¶¶] As of the date of [these] Motion[s] [were] filed, [Plaintiffs
have] not contacted anyone at my office. 
Due to the lack of cooperation with [Plaintiffs],  my office is unable to provide further
discovery responses or produce [them] for a deposition.”  (Forms
MC-052.)¿¿¿¿ 
¿ 
Absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s
request for withdrawal should be granted.¿ (People v. Prince (1968) 268
Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)¿¿¿ 
¿ 
Upon review, the court finds that the Motions comply with
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.¿ Given the lack of opposition, the
court further finds no prejudice will result from the granting of plaintiffs’ counsel’s
request to withdraw.   
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
            Accordingly,
the unopposed Motions to Be Relieved as Counsel are GRANTED and effective upon
the filing of the proof of service of this signed order upon Plaintiffs.  
 
The court sets a Status Conference re: Counsel for Plaintiffs
for October 14, 2024. 
 
Counsel to give notice.
