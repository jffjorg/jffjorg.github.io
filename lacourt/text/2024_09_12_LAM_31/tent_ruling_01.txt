PETITION
TO CONFIRM ATTORNEY-CLIENT FEE ARBITRATION AWARD 


 
MOVING PARTY:               Petitioner
Cox Law Group, APC
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
On June 17, 2022, Plaintiff Cox Law Group, APC, filed this action
against Defendant Hanson Kelvin Hsu for Defendant’s failure to pay attorney’s
fees incurred in an underlying conservatorship matter.   On August 26, 2022, Plaintiff was served with
a letter from the Long Beach Bar Association indicating that Defendant had
filed a request for nonbinding arbitration with the association August 15,
2022.  The matter proceeded in
arbitration before Arbitrators Toby J. Rothschild, Norma Ann Dawson, and Evelyn
Perl (the “Arbitrators”).
 
On March 19, 2024, the Arbitrators issued an arbitration
award in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the principal sum of $28,670.47.
 
 
On May 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed this Petition to Confirm
Attorney-Client Fee Arbitration Award (the “Petition”) against Defendant.  On the same day, Plaintiff filed a Notice of
Hearing on its Petition.  Plaintiff seeks
a judgment of $28,670.47, interest at 10% per annum, attorney fees in the sum
of $9,405.00 pursuant to Business & Professions Code section 6203, and
costs in the amount of $60.00.
 
            The Petition
is unopposed. 
             
II.        LEGAL STANDARD 
 
Once arbitration is concluded,
“any arbitrator’s award is enforceable only when confirmed as a judgment of the
superior court.”¿ (O’Hare v. Municipal Resource Consultants (2003)
107¿Cal.App.4th 267, 278.)¿ Any of the parties may file a petition with the
court, which must then “confirm the award, correct and confirm it, vacate it,
or dismiss the petition.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,¿§§¿1285, 1286; EHM
Productions, Inc. v. Starline Tours of Hollywood,¿Inc. (2018) 21
Cal.App.5th 1058, 1063.)¿“It is well settled that the scope of judicial review
of arbitration awards is extremely narrow.” (California Faculty Assn. v.
Superior Court¿(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 935, 943.)¿ “Neither the trial court,
nor the appellate court, may ‘review the merits of the dispute, the sufficiency
of the evidence, or the arbitrator’s reasoning, nor may we correct or review an
award because of an arbitrator’s legal or factual error, even if it appears on
the award’s face.”¿ (EHM Productions, supra, at p. 1063-64.)¿ 
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
            Plaintiff
seeks an order confirming the arbitration award issued on March 19, 2024, and awarding
attorney fees and costs.
 
An arbitrator’s award is enforceable only after being confirmed
by a court of law. (O’Hare, 107 Cal.App.4th at p. 278.)¿ “An award that
has not been confirmed or vacated has the same force and effect as a contract
in writing between the parties to the arbitration.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
1287.6.)¿ Thus, the court must first evaluate and confirm the initial
arbitration award.¿        
            
A.   
Filing
Requirements (CCP § 1285.4)  
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1285.4 states: “A petition
under this chapter shall: 
 
a.      
Set forth the substance of or have
attached a copy of the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies the
existence of such an agreement. 
b.     
Set forth the names of the
arbitrators. 
c.      
Set forth or have attached a copy of
the award and the written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.” 
 
Here, Plaintiff submits the written Statement of Decision
and Award issued by the Arbitrators.  (Pet.,
Attachment 6(c).)  Plaintiff also submits
a copy of the Notice of Attorney Responsibility and Request for Arbitration of
a Fee Dispute with the Long Beach Bar Association’s Mandatory Fee Arbitration
Program.  (Hoang Decl., Ex. 4.)  Plaintiff has satisfied the filing
requirements. 
¿¿ 
B.    
Service of the Arbitration Award
& Timeliness of Petition (CCP §§ 1283.6, 1288, 1288.4)¿ 
¿ 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1283.6 provides that: “The
neutral arbitrator shall serve a signed copy of the award on each party
to the arbitration personally or by registered or certified mail or as provided
in the agreement.”¿ In addition, a party may seek a court judgment confirming
an arbitration award by filing and serving a petition no more than four years,
but not less than 10 days, after the award is served.¿ (Code Civ. Proc.,¿§§
1288, 1288.4.)¿ 
¿ 
Here, Plaintiff submits proof of service showing the Final
Award was served by the Arbitrators by mail on March 20, 2024.  (Pet., Attachment 6(c).)  This Petition followed
on May 17, 2024.  The Petition is timely. 
 
C.    
Service of
the Petition, and Notice of Hearing (CCP § 1290.4)¿¿ 
¿ 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1290.4, the statute
governing proper service of this motion states, in pertinent part:¿¿ 
¿ 
“(a) A copy of the petition and a written notice of the time
and place of the hearing thereof and any other papers upon which the petition
is based shall be served in the manner provided in the arbitration agreement
for the service of such petition and notice.¿ 
¿ 
(b) If the arbitration agreement does not provide the manner
in which such service shall be made and the person upon whom service is to be
made has not previously appeared in the proceeding and has not previously been
served in accordance with this subdivision: ¶ (1) Service within this State
shall be made in the manner provided by law for the service of summons in an
action.¿ 
  
      Service by mail of a petition to vacate an arbitration award issued under the Mandatory
Fee Arbitration Act is proper only if the responding party has appeared with
“the court in which the action is pending, ...”  (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 6203, subd. (b).)
 
Here, Plaintiff served Defendant with a copy of this Petition
and notice of Petition on February 22, 2024, by first-class mail, in a pending
action.  Further, Defendant appeared in
this action by filing an Answer on August 24, 2022.  Plaintiff demonstrates that the Petition was
properly served.  
 
IV.        CONCLUSION
 
            Based on
the foregoing, the unopposed Petition to Confirm Attorney-Client Fee Arbitration
Award is GRANTED. 
 
            Plaintiff
to give notice.  
 
                                                                                                            
DATED:  September 11, 2024
