And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling in a legal malpractice action brought by Fred Goldstein against Joshua Driskell, et al. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants failed to properly represent him in an underlying probate action. The defendants objected to interrogatories served by the plaintiff, and the plaintiff has moved to compel further responses. The court finds that the motion is timely and rejects the defendant's challenge to the meet and confer requirement. However, the court finds that the plaintiff failed to comply with the requirement to participate in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) prior to the hearing, and continues the hearing to allow the parties to participate in an IDC. The court will hear the motion on November 8, 2024.
