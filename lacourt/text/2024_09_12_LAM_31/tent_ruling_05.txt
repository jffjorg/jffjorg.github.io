I.          INTRODUCTION
                            
            On May 10,
2024, Plaintiff Duygu Arpinar filed six discovery motions: two (2) motions to
compel responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Set One, from Defendants Shain
Karimian and Karimian Law Group; a motion to compel responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set One from Defendant Shahin Karimian; a motion to compel
responses to Request for Production of Documents from Defendant Karimian Law
Group, APC; and two (2) motions to deem admitted Plaintiff’s Request for
Admissions, Set One, against Defendants. 
Plaintiff requests sanctions against Defendants and their counsel.
 
            On August
23, 2024, defense counsel filed a declaration in opposition to Plaintiff’s Form
Interrogatories on behalf of Defendant Karimian Law Group.
 
            On September
4, 2024, Plaintiff filed notices of non-opposition to the motions to compel
responses to Special Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents,
and notices of non-opposition to the motions to deem the Request for Admissions
admitted.
 
            On
September 5, 2024, Plaintiff replied to Defendant Karimian Law Group’s
opposition.
 
            On
September 11, 2024, defense counsel filed another declaration which shows
discovery responses were served to the at-issue discovery requests on September
10, 2024.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
 
            If
a party to whom interrogatories or inspection demands were directed fails to
serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order to compel
responses without objections.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (b);
2031.300, subd. (b).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
fails to serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
that the truth of the matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)¿ Failure to timely
serve responses waives objections to the requests. ¿(Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290, subd. (a); 2031.300, subd. (a); 2033.280, subd.
(a).)   
 
A party moving to compel discovery
responses under these statutory provisions is not required to meet and confer
prior to filing the motion.¿ (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (b),
2031.300, subd. (b); 2030290, subd. (b); see also Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 411 (Sinaiko) [citing Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111
Cal.App.3d 902, 906 for the proposition that “meet and confer” requirement “did
not apply when propounding party sought order compelling responses to
interrogatories and sanctions for responding party's failure to respond ‘within
the statutorily permitted time’”].)¿¿¿¿ 
 
¿           Monetary
Sanctions¿ 
¿ 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030 is a general statute authorizing the Court to impose discovery
sanctions for “misuse of the discovery process,” which includes (without
limitation) a variety of conduct such as: making, without substantial justification,
an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an evasive response to
discovery; and unsuccessfully and without substantial justification making or
opposing a motion to compel or limit discovery.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.010.)¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
If sanctions are sought, Code of
Civil Procedure section 2023.040 requires that the notice specify the identity
of the person against whom sanctions are sought and the type of sanction
requested, that the motion be supported in the points and authorities, and the
facts be set forth in a declaration supporting the amount of any monetary
sanction.¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
If the court finds that a party
has unsuccessfully made or opposed a motion to compel responses to
interrogatories, the court “shall impose a monetary sanction . . . unless it
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”¿ (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).) 
 
Sanctions against counsel:¿ The court in Kwan
Software Engineering, Inc. v. Hennings (2020) 58 Cal.App.5th 57, 81 (Hennings)
noted that discovery sanctions against an attorney are governed by a different
standard than sanctions against a party:¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿ 
By the terms of the statute, a trial court under section
2023.030(a) may not impose monetary sanctions against a party’s attorney unless
the court finds that the attorney “advised” the party to engage in the conduct
resulting in sanctions. (§ 2023.030(a); Ghanooni v. Super Shuttle (1993)
20 Cal.App.4th 256, 261, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 501.)¿ “Unlike monetary sanctions
against a party, which are based on the party's misuse of the discovery
process, monetary sanctions against the party's attorney require a finding the
‘attorney advis[ed] that conduct.’ ” (Ibid.) “It is not enough that the
attorney's actions were in some way improper.” (Corns v. Miller (1986)
181 Cal.App.3d 195, 200, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247 (Corns).) Because an
attorney's advice to a client is “peculiarly within [his or her] knowledge,”
the attorney has the burden of showing that he or she did not counsel discovery
abuse. (Ibid.) Accordingly, when a party seeking sanctions against an
attorney offers sufficient evidence of a misuse of the discovery process, the
burden shifts to the attorney to demonstrate that he or she did not recommend
that conduct. (Id. at pp. 200–201, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247; Ghanooni,
at p. 262, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 501.)¿¿ 
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
            It is undisputed Plaintiff properly
served Defendants with the at-issue discovery requests.  
 
            On September 11, 2024, counsel for
Defendants filed a declaration stating: 
 
Attached hereto are the copies of
Defendant Karimian Law Group, APC’s Responses to Form Interrogatories (Set
One); Defendant Shahin Karimian’s Responses to Form Interrogatories (Set One);
Defendant Karimian Law Group, APC’s Responses to Special Interrogatories (Set
One); Defendant Karimian Law Group, APC’s Responses to Requests for Admissions
(Set One); Defendant Shahin Karimian’s Responses to Requests for Admissions
(Set One); and Defendant Karimian Law Group, APC’s Responses to Requests for
Production of Documents (Set One), served via e-mail on September 10, 2024.
 
            To say that such a late filing is
frustrating is to minimize the usage of the term frustrating. Nonetheless, the motions
to compel and to deem admitted the requests for admission are DENIED.  
 
            Plaintiff makes one further
argument.  Plaintiff argues Defendant
Karimian Law Group’s responses should be compelled because Defendants
improperly asserted Defendant Shawn Karimian’s responses to the Form
Interrogatories on behalf of both defendants. 
Plaintiff argues the propounded form interrogatories were different.  Therefore, Defendant Shawn Karimian’s
responses are not responsive to form interrogatories propounded on Defendant
Karimian Law Group.  But Plaintiff takes
issue with the substance of responses that were served.  Plaintiff’s recourse is to file a motion to
compel further response.  Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses by Defendants to the Form
Interrogatories, Set One is DENIED as MOOT.
 
Monetary Sanctions
 
            Plaintiff requests sanctions against
Defendants and their counsel of record.¿ Given Defendants counsels extremely
late and untimely filings, sanctions are warranted.¿ Indeed, in the context of
untimely responses to admissions requests, sanctions are mandatory.¿ (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)¿ Pursuant to Hennings, supra,
imposition of monetary sanctions against counsel is also proper unless counsel
shows that he or she did not counsel the discovery abuse.¿ (Hennings, 58
Cal.App.5th at p. 81.)¿ Defense counsel does not meet his burden.¿ Accordingly,
sanctions are imposed against Defendants and their counsel of record in the full
requested amount of $11,028.00 ($1,838 per motion).
 
 IV.       CONCLUSION
            
Plaintiff’s discovery motions are MOOT.
 
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is GRANTED.  Defendants and their counsel of record are
ordered to pay, jointly and severally, sanctions in the amount of $11,028.00 to
Plaintiff, by and through his counsel, within 30 days of this order.¿ 
 
Counsel to give notice.
