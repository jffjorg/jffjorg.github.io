And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in favor of the plaintiff, Cox Law Group, APC, in a petition to confirm an arbitration award. The award was issued on March 19, 2024, in a dispute over attorney's fees incurred in an underlying conservatorship matter. The defendant, Hanson Kelvin Hsu, failed to pay the fees and the arbitration award was issued in favor of the plaintiff. The plaintiff seeks a judgment of $28,670.47, interest, attorney fees, and costs.

The judge finds that the petition is timely and that the plaintiff has satisfied the filing requirements. The judge also finds that the arbitration award was properly served on the defendant and that the petition was properly served.

The judge grants the petition and confirms the arbitration award. The judge orders the plaintiff to give notice of the confirmation.

The judge's decision is based on the laws and regulations governing arbitration and the confirmation of arbitration awards in California. The judge notes that the scope of judicial review of arbitration awards is extremely narrow and that the court may not review the merits of the dispute or the arbitrator's reasoning.
