And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on the discovery motions filed by the plaintiff, Duygu Arpinar, against the defendants, Shahin Karimian and Karimian Law Group, APC. The plaintiff sought to compel discovery responses and sanctions against the defendants for their failure to timely respond to discovery requests. The judge denied the motions to compel and to deem admitted the requests for admission, finding that the defendants' late filing of discovery responses was not sufficient to warrant compelling responses.

The judge did, however, grant the plaintiff's request for sanctions against the defendants and their counsel of record, imposing a sanction of $11,028.00 ($1,838.00 per motion) for the defendants' and counsel's failure to comply with discovery deadlines. The judge also imposed sanctions against counsel, requiring them to pay the sanctions jointly and severally, unless they can show that they did not counsel the discovery abuse.
