PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT 
 



 
            Plaintiff First Utah Bank (“Plaintiff”) requests that the Court enter

in

interest, $4,367.24 in
attorney’s fees, and $990.00 in costs. Plaintiff also seeks a judgment
that “Plaintiff shall recover from Defendants named in item 5a above the possession
of the collateral listed in the attached UCC Financing Statements. Upon
recovery and sale of such collateral, Plaintiff shall apply the net proceeds of
such sale to the judgment set forth in Item 6.1.(6) above.”  
The
Court finds that Plaintiff has sufficiently supported its request with the
submitted declarations and evidence. Therefore, Plaintiff’s request is granted,
and the Court will sign the judgment. No appearance at the hearing is
necessary.¿¿
