```

Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has denied the Motion for Joinder filed by Plaintiff Sarah Keys, seeking to join Maya Giuliani as an additional plaintiff in the action. The Court finds that Giuliani is not a necessary party to the Complaint, as the Plaintiff has failed to establish that Giuliani's joinder is necessary to accord complete relief among the parties. The Court also finds that Giuliani's potential future litigation based on the same collision does not invoke the "complete relief" clause under Code of Civil Procedure section 389, subdivision (a). Furthermore, the Court determines that Giuliani's willingness to voluntarily join is irrelevant under Code of Civil Procedure section 389, subdivision (a). Therefore, the Court denies the Motion for Joinder.
