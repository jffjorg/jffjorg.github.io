And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel arbitration, which means that the dispute will be resolved through arbitration rather than through a court trial. The court has also granted the plaintiff's motion to stay proceedings, which means that the court proceedings will be put on hold until the arbitration is complete. The defendant does not oppose the plaintiff's request to have the claims resolved in arbitration, and the parties have proposed using either ADR Services, Inc. or JAMS as the arbitration services provider.
