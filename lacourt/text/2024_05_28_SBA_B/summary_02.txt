The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for determination of good faith settlement between plaintiffs and defendant CST Industries, Inc. The settlement was for $1.3 million and was reached after a private mediation. The court finds that the settlement was made in good faith and grants the motion. The court also finds that Kiewit Infrastructure West Co. failed to meet its burden to show that the settlement was not made in good faith. The court notes that the settlement amount is reasonable and that the financial condition and insurance limits of the settling defendants are not relevant. The court also finds that the settlement does not affect Kiewit's claim for express indemnity against CST Industries, Inc. The court orders that all claims against CST Industries, Inc. for equitable comparative contribution, or partial or comparative indemnity, based on comparative negligence or comparative fault, are barred.
