SMITH, SR. vs RICARDO HERNANDEZ
Case No. 23TRCV02998

On September
18, 2023 Plaintiff Lilliam Smith, Sr. filed a Complaint-Personal Injury, etc. against
Defendant Ricardo Hernandez.  On January
11, 2024 Plaintiff filed a Proof of Service of Summons purporting to show that
Defendant Hernandez was substitute served on December 26, 2023.  Based on that proof of service, and the
Request for Entry of Default filed May 3, 2024, the clerk of the court entered
the default of Defendant Hernandez on May 3, 2024.
A review of
the January 11, 2024 Proof of Service of Summons reveals that the person who
served the papers failed to complete item 7 on the Proof of Service as he did
not provide a complete address.
Based upon
the foregoing, the Court intends to issue an Order to Show Cause why the Proof
of Service of Summons filed January 11, 2024 should not be ordered stricken,
and the default based thereon entered May 3, 2024 be ordered vacated.
The Court
also notes that on May 6, 2024 a Declaration was filed by Atty. Tom V. Wynsma
claiming to represent Defendant Ricardo Hernandez.  He notes that Hernandez was substitute served
on April 1, 2024.  The Declaration notes
that on April 23, 2024 (a date prior to the date that Plaintiff sought to
obtain the May 3, 2024 Default) counsel for Hernandez wrote a meet and confer
letter regarding a potential demurrer to Plaintiff. A copy of the first page of
that letter was attached by Plaintiff to his May 3, 2024 Declaration establishing
that prior to seeking the Default, Plaintiff was aware of the existence of
counsel for Defendant.
