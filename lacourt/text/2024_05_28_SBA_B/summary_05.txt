And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge intends to issue an order to show cause why the proof of service of summons filed on January 11, 2024 should not be stricken, and the default based thereon entered on May 3, 2024 be vacated. The judge also notes that a declaration was filed by Atty. Tom V. Wynsma claiming to represent the defendant, Ricardo Hernandez, stating that Hernandez was substitute served on April 1, 2024. The judge is considering the validity of the proof of service and the default entered in light of the alleged substitute service and the meet and confer letter sent by the defendant's counsel.
