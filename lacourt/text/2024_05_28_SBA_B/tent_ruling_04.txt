            The court considered the moving

Background
            On June 23, 2023, Plaintiff NDSC
filed its Complaint in Interpleader as to 10937 Ardath Avenue, Inglewood, CA
90303-2404 (the “Property”). On or around July 10, 2023, NDSC deposited
$72,535.59  (the “Surplus Funds”) with
this Court. NDSC received the Surplus Funds in its role as Trustee to the
foreclosure of the Property held on September 22, 2022.
            On April 30, 2024, NDSC filed the
instant motion to award attorneys’ fees and costs and to discharge NDSC from
interpleader proceedings. NDSC specifically requests the Court discharge NDSC
of liability, and award costs of $5,150.65 to be deducted from the Interpleader
Funds prior to any disbursement to any potential claimant.
            On
May 22, 2024, Defendants filed the STIPULATION RE: AWARD OF ATTORNEY’S FEES AND
COSTS; TO DISCHARGE PLAINTIFF; AND TO DISBURSE SURPLUS FUNDS; [PROPOSED] ORDER
(the “Stipulation”) wherein the parties stipulated that NDSC shall be
discharged of liability from this interpleader proceeding; the Clerk shall
issue a check in the amount of $5,150.65, less the Clerk’s fees, if any,
payable to “Tiffany & Bosco, P.A. Client Trust Account,” and mailed to
Tiffany & Bosco, P.A., 1455 Frazee Road, Suite 820, San Diego, CA 92108;
and the Clerk shall issue a check in the amount of $67,384.94, less the Clerk’s
fee, if any, payable to “The Law Offices of Jack M. LaPedis Client Trust
Account,” and mailed to Jack M. LaPedis, Esq., The Law Offices of Jack M.
LaPedis, 4804 Laurel Canyon Blvd., Suite 1110, Valley Village, CA 91607-3717.
The Stipulation is dated and signed by the attorneys for the parties. 
            The
Stipulation addresses everything requested in NDSC’s instant motion. Therefore,
in light of the Stipulation, NDSC’s
motion for attorneys’ fees and costs and to discharge Plaintiff is GRANTED.
            Moving
party is ordered to give notice of ruling.
