TENTATIVE RULING
 
The
Court sustains the Demurrer to the third cause of action, with 20 days leave to
amend.
 
Background
 
On February 20, 2021, Plaintiffs Dimas and
Martha Figueroa purchased a 2021 CR-V Honda distributed by Defendant American
Honda Motor Co., Inc. (Complaint ¶ 5.) Plaintiff alleges that during
the warranty period, the vehicle developed defects in the body system,
powertrain system, safety system, electrical system, braking system, and noise
system. (Complaint ¶ 11.)
Plaintiffs further allege that Defendant was unable to repair the vehicle
within a reasonable number of attempts. (Complaint ¶ 12.) On August 14, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the
Complaint alleging causes of action for violation of subdivision (d) of Civil
Code Section 1793.2, violation of subdivision (b) of Civil Code Section 1793.2,
violation of subdivision (a)(3) of Civil Code Section 1793.2, breach of express
written warranty, and breach of the implied warranty of merchantability. On
October 28, 2024, Defendant filed the Demurrer. On January 2, 2025, Plaintiffs
filed the Opposition. On January 8, 2025, Defendant filed the reply.
 
Arguments
 
Defendant demurs to the third cause
of action for violation of subdivision (a)(3) of Civil Code Section 1793.2.  In support of their demurrer, Defendant argues:
·               
Plaintiffs’
claim for violation of subdivision (a)(3) of Civil Code Section 1793.2 fails to
articulate the required factual allegations to plead a cause of action.
In
opposition, Plaintiffs argue:
·               
Plaintiffs have adequately pleaded a claim for violation
of subdivision (a)(3) of Civil Code Section 1793.2.
Defendants reply:
 
·               
Plaintiffs’ Opposition failed to state a single fact
that can support a cause of action for violation of
subdivision (a)(3) of Civil Code Section 1793.2.
ANALYSIS
 
 
A.    Meet and Confer 
 
A party is required to meet and
confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is
subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be
reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).) The meet and confer effort must occur at
least five days before the date the responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(2).)
 
The parties met and conferred by email
on September 18, October 10, and October 15. 
(Geraghty Decl. ¶¶ 2-5.)  These
meet and confer efforts are sufficient under § 430.41.  
 
B.    Legal Standard for Demurrer
 
“[A]
demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.” (Lewis
v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  A demurrer can be used only to challenge
defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from matters
outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable.  (See Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co.
(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 (in ruling on a demurrer, a court may not
consider declarations, matters not subject to judicial notice, or documents not
accepted for the truth of their contents).) 
For purposes of ruling on a demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint
are assumed to be true, but the reviewing court does not assume the truth of
conclusions of law. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hosp. Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962,
967.)    
 
Leave to
amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment.
(See Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349 (court shall not
“sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if there is any reasonable
possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment”); Kong v. City of
Hawaiian Gardens Redevelopment Agency (2002) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1037 (“A
demurrer should not be sustained without leave to amend if the complaint,
liberally construed, can state a cause of action under any theory or if there
is a reasonable possibility the defect can be cured by amendment.”).)  The burden is on the complainant to show the
Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Blank v. Kirwan
(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)
 
C.    Analysis

 
 
Defendant
argues that a complaint must provide sufficient factual detail to alert the
defendant to the cause of action. (Redfearn v. Trader Joe's Co. (2018)
20 Cal. App. 5th 989, 996.) Specifically, when statutory remedies are invoked,
the facts must be pleaded with particularity. (Carter v. Prime Healthcare
Paradise Valley LLC (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 396,410.)
 
Defendant
contends that Plaintiffs' Third Cause of Action fails to meet these standards.
The Complaint merely recites provisions of Civil Code section 1793.2 and offers
conclusory statements without specifying facts, such as how Defendant allegedly
violated the Civil Code, what service literature or replacement parts were
unavailable, or how this failure caused damages.
 
Defendant
further argues that the Complaint does not provide any factual allegations to
support the claim for damages or civil penalties. The generalized assertions,
such as entitlement to "a civil penalty of two times Plaintiffs' actual
damages,” fail to meet the pleading standard necessary to sustain the claim.
 
Defendant
concludes that the lack of factual detail prevents them from being apprised of
the factual basis for the claims, and thus, the Demurrer to Plaintiffs' Third
Cause of Action should be sustained.
 
In
opposition, Plaintiffs argue that the Complaint sufficiently alleges a cause of
action under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. Contrary to Defendant's
assertion that the complaint lacks specificity and contains mere conclusions,
Plaintiff contends that it pleads sufficient facts to meet the standard
required for a demurrer. 
 
Plaintiffs
emphasize that a general demurrer should not be sustained if the complaint
states a cause of action on any theory. (Gomez v. Volkswagen of Am., Inc. (1985)
169 Cal.App.3d 921, 924-925.)  They
assert that the Song-Beverly Act is a remedial measure intended to protect
consumers and should be liberally construed to bring its benefits into action.
(Kwan v. Mercedes-Benz of N.Am., Inc. (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 174, 184.)
The Complaint alleges that Plaintiffs purchased a vehicle with an express
warranty, encountered defects during the warranty period, and that Defendant
failed to make sufficient service literature and replacement parts available,
resulting in damages. (Complaint ¶ 5, 9, 10-11, and 30-31.)  These allegations, Plaintiff argues, provide
the essential facts needed to state a claim.
 
Plaintiffs
further note that Defendant’s demand for heightened specificity, such as
identifying specific service literature or parts, is unfounded. They argue that
the Song-Beverly Act does not require this level of detail at the pleading
stage, as no case law or statutory authority supports such a requirement.
Moreover, Plaintiff points out that Defendant possesses superior knowledge of
the relevant facts, such as the repair history of the vehicle, and it would be
unreasonable to expect Plaintiff to have access to this information prior to
discovery.
 
In
reply, Defendant argues that Plaintiffs’ Opposition fails to address the
fundamental deficiencies in their Third Cause of Action, which alleges a
violation of Civil Code Section 1793.2(a)(3). Defendant contends that
Plaintiffs merely repeat the statutory language without providing factual
support, failing to meet the required pleading standard. (See Blank v. Kirwan
(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) Statutory claims must be pleaded with
particularity, including specific facts rather than conclusory statements.
Plaintiffs’ complaint lacks allegations detailing what service literature or
replacement parts were unavailable and when.
 
Defendant
further argues that Plaintiffs fail to allege any specific damages suffered as
a result of the purported violation. A general statement claiming damages
without factual support is insufficient to establish a cause of action.
Defendant asserts that Plaintiffs’ argument relies on unsubstantiated
inferences, which do not meet established pleading requirements.
 
Moreover,
Plaintiffs do not address Defendant’s argument that there is no factual basis
to support their claims of wrongdoing or damages, nor do they provide a valid
argument for leave to amend. Defendant urges the court to sustain the demurrer
without leave to amend, as Plaintiffs have not demonstrated any ability to
remedy the deficiencies in their complaint.
 
Civil
Code section 1793.2 subdivision (a)(3) “Every manufacturer of consumer goods
sold in this state and for which the manufacturer has made an express warranty
shall: Make available to authorized service and repair facilities sufficient
service literature and replacement parts to effect repairs during the express
warranty period.” (Civ. Code § 1793.2 subd. (a)(3).) 
In
the Complaint, Plaintiffs pleaded that Defendant “Failed to make available to
the privately owned service and repair shops sufficient service literature and
replacement parts to effect repairs during the express warranty period” and
that “Plaintiffs have been damaged by Defendant AHM’s failure to comply with
its obligations.” (Complaint ¶ 31.) While all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed
to be true, the Court does not consider conclusions of law. (Aubry, supra, 2
Cal.4th 962, 967.) Here, the Plaintiffs have pleaded that they were damaged but
have not provided any facts to show how they were damaged. Thus, Plaintiffs’
claim for damages is a conclusion of law and is not considered by the Court.
Consequently, Plaintiffs have not pleaded sufficient facts to support a cause
of action for violation of Civil
Code section 1793.2 subdivision (a)(3). (Lewis, supra, 235
Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)
 
Therefore, the Court sustains the Demurrer to
the third cause of action, with 20 days leave to amend.
