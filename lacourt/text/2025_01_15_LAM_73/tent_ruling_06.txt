[motion TO COMPEL SPECIAL
INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE] (filed December 13, 2024) 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendant’s motion
to compel Special Interrogatories, set one is GRANTED. Defendant’s request for
sanctions is GRANTED.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
This case arises from a motor vehicle accident between Plaintiff
Ciro Martinez (Plaintiff) and Defendant Sheny Maradiaga (Defendant). 
 
On August 14, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendant,
alleging a single cause of action for Negligence. 
 
On December 13, 2024, Defendant filed the instant motion to compel
Plaintiff’s responses to Special Interrogatories, set one (SROGs). No
opposition has been filed.
II. ANALYSIS
 
A.      Legal
Standard 
 
A responding party has 30 days after service of
interrogatories to serve their responses on the propounding party. (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2030.260(a).) However, if interrogatories are served by electronic
service, a responding party has an additional two (2) court days to respond. (Id.
§ 1010.6(a)(3)(B).)¿ 
 
If the responding party fails to timely respond to
the interrogatories, “the party to whom the interrogatories are directed waives
any right to exercise the option to produce writings under Section 2030.230, as
well as any objection to the interrogatories, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010).” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290(a).)¿ 
 
Furthermore, the party propounding the
interrogatories may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290(b), 2031.300(b).) And “[u]nlike
a motion to compel further responses, a motion to compel responses is not
subject to a 45-day time limit, and the propounding party does not have to
demonstrate either good cause or that it satisfied a ‘meet and confer’
requirement.” (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.)¿¿ 
 
Failure
to timely respond waives all objections, including privilege and work product,
unless “[t]he party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance”
and “[t]he party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of
mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290
(a)(1)-(2).)
 
B.     
Discussion
 
Defendant moves to compel Plaintiff to
provide verified responses without objections to SROGs. 
 
Here, on October 3, 2024, Defendant
served upon Plaintiff the SROGs. (Chan Decl., ¶ 2, Exh. A.) Plaintiff’s
responses were thus due no later than November 4, 2024. 
 
Therefore,
Plaintiff is compelled to serve verified
responses to Defendant’s SROGs, without objections.
 
 
Sanctions
 
When a request for monetary sanctions is
concurrently filed with a motion to compel responses, “The court may impose a
monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable
expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that
conduct.” (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2023.030(a).) Additionally, “If a monetary
sanction is authorized by any provision of this title, the court shall impose
that sanction unless it finds that one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
sanction unjust.” (Ibid.)¿ 
 
As explained above, Plaintiffs did not serve timely
responses to Defendant’s SROGs. Plaintiff has also not filed an opposition to
provide the Court with any substantial justification as to why the responses
were not timely given. Thus, sanctions against Plaintiff are appropriate.  
 
Defendant requests $455.34 in sanctions. 
 
Counsel for Defendant declares that she incurred two
(2) hours of fees to meet and confer, review the motion and declaration, and
appear at the hearing, at $160.17 per hour, plus one (1) hour of legal
assistant time to reserve the hearing and draft motion, at $75.00 per hour. The
Court finds that the amount of time spent in association with the instant
motion and the hourly rates to be reasonable. Thus, the Court will award
Defendant the requested $455.34 in sanctions, which includes the $60.00 filing
fee.
 

III.

Interrogatories, set one is GRANTED. Plaintiff must provide code-compliant

notice of this order.
 
Defendant’s request for sanctions is GRANTED in the amount of $455.34. Sanctions are payable within 30
days’ notice of this order.
