TENTATIVE RULING
 
Motion to Compel Production of Documents from
Non-Party Safeco Insurance Company of America and Request for Order Awarding
Monetary Sanctions Against Safeco Insurance Company of America in the Amount of
$324.92 is GRANTED.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On July 28, 2023, plaintiff LaToya Reed (Plaintiff) filed her
initial complaint against defendant Anna Mezheritsky (Defendant) and Does 1
through 10, inclusive. (Compl. p. 1.) On January 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed her first
amended complaint, alleging the following: (1) Breach of Contract; (2)
Obligation to Pay for Legal Services Rendered and Costs Under Written Contract;
(3) Common Count: Quantum Meruit: Costs and Services Rendered; and (4)
Declaratory Relief. (First Amend. Compl. p. 1.)
 
The causes of action arise after Defendant hired Plaintiff to
represent her in the case of Anna Mezheritsky v. Dorothy Kovich Klien (Underlying
Case). (First Amend. Compl. ¶ 8.) On September 23, 2019, the attorney-client
relationship ended, and Defendant owed Plaintiff a fee for her legal services
and other incurred costs. (First Amend. Compl. ¶ 8.) Defendant claims Plaintiff
owes her an outstanding balance of $35,489.51 plus interest. (First Amend.
Compl. ¶ 9.) On September 25, 2019, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Attorney Lien
on the Underlying Case and served it on Defendant’s new counsel. (First Amend.
Compl. ¶ 10.) 
 
On September 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed and was granted an entry
for default. (Entry of Default p. 1.) 
 
On March 11, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed Does 1 through 10 only.
(Dismissal p. 1.)
 
On March 15, 2024, the Court entered the default judgment against
Defendant. (Default Judgment p. 1.)
 
On September 6, 2024, Plaintiff served a Deposition Subpoena for
Production of Business Records on Safeco Insurance Company of America (Safeco).
(Decl. Redd Exh. A.) Safeco was to produce the documents on September 23, 2024.
(Decl. Redd Exh. A.) Safeco did not serve an objection prior to the date.
(Decl. Redd ¶ 3.) Safeco did not produce the documents on the prescribed date
and location. (Decl. Redd ¶ 3.)
 
From September 24, 2024 to October 22, 2024, a deposition officer
attempted to obtain the documents requested in the subpoena. (Decl. Redd ¶ 5,
Exh. B.) The deposition officer eventually reached Safeco on October 11, 2024.
(Decl. Redd Exh. B.) The Subpoena Response Team stated that “Defense Counsel in
this case has filed an interpleader to resolve this matter per Court Order, [and]
therefore we cannot respond to this Subpoena.” (Decl. Redd Exh. B.)
 
On November 8, 2024, Plaintiff states she told Safeco’s counsel
that she would be filing a motion to compel should Safeco not produce the
documents requested by November 12, 2024 at noon. (Decl. Redd ¶ 4.) 
 
As time of filing, November 13, 2024, Safeco has not produced the
documents requested under the subpoena. (Decl. Redd ¶ 5.)
 
On November 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed the Motion to Compel Production of Documents
from Non-Party Safeco Insurance Company of America and Request for Order
Awarding Monetary Sanctions Against Safeco Insurance Company of America in the
Amount of $1,574.92, arguing:
·               
The information requested in the
subpoena will directly assist Plaintiff with discovering the existence and
monies that will satisfy the judgment in the case. (Motion p. 4.)
·               
Good cause exists for production of all documents
because “the documents are relevant and material to the material to the
existence and location of movies to satisfy the judgment” and “the different
categories listed in the subpoena will aid Plaintiff … in satisfying the
judgment.” (Motion p. 5.) 
·               
Plaintiff and the deposition report met
and conferred with Safeco’s counsel and agents regarding the subpoena. (Motion
p. 6.)
·               
$74.92 should be awarded to Plaintiff
against Safeco for its failure to comply with the subpoena. Plaintiffs incurred
costs in connection with preparing and filing the motion. Plaintiff incurred $60
for filing this motion and a $14.92 E-Filing Fee, resulting in $74.92. (Motion p. 6; Decl. Redd ¶ 7.) 
·               
Under California Code of Civil Procedure[1] section 177.5, the Court should impose
sanctions in the amount of $1,500 against Safeco for not complying with a court
order, the subpoena. (Motion p. 7-8.)
There is no opposition or reply.
 
 
 
 
 
 
II. ANALYSIS
 
A.      Legal
Standard for Motion to Compel Deposition Subpoena
 
“[D]iscovery
from a nonparty may be obtained only by ‘deposition subpoena’ (§ 2020.010,
subd. (b)).” (Unzipped Apparel, LLC v. Bader (2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 123,
130 (Unzipped), italics removed.)¿¿ “A business records subpoena
directs the nonparty’s custodian of records (or other qualified person) to
deliver the requested documents (in person, by messenger, or by mail) to the
‘deposition officer’ specified in the subpoena.¿ (§ 2020.430, subd. (a).)”¿ (Id.
at p. 131.)¿¿¿ 
 
“If a
deponent fails to answer any question or to produce any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing under the deponent’s
control that is specified in the deposition notice or a deposition subpoena,
the party seeking discovery may move the court for an order compelling that
answer or production.”¿ (§ 2025.480, subd.¿ (a).)¿ “This motion shall be made
no later than 60 days after the completion of the record of the deposition, and
shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.”¿
(§ 2025.480, subd. (b).) 
 
“In Unzipped,
the court held that the record of the deposition was complete, and the 60-day
clock began to run, on the deposition subpoena's date of production when the
nonparty deponents asserted objections and declined to produce responsive
documents.” (In re Marriage of Moore, 102 Cal.App.5th 1275, 1287, citing
Unzipped, supra, 156 Cal.App.4th at pp. 128, 131–136.) 
  
Section
1987.1, subdivision (a), provides that if a subpoena requires the production of
documents, the Court may, upon motion reasonably made by a party, make an order
“directing compliance with it upon those terms or conditions as the court shall
declare.” (§ 1987.1, subd. (a).) 
 
“The court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel an answer or production, unless it finds that the
one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (§ 2025.480, subd. (j).)

 
Furthermore,
under section 2023.030, subdivision (a), “[t]he court may impose a monetary
sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or
any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses,
including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that
conduct.  If a monetary sanction is authorized by any provision of this
title, the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (§ 2023.030,
subd. (a).) 
 
Section
2023.010 defines misuses of the discovery process to include “[f]ailing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery[,]” “[m]aking an
evasive response to discovery[,]” and “[f]ailing to confer in person, by
telephone, or by letter with an opposing party or attorney in a reasonable and
good faith attempt to resolve informally any dispute concerning discovery, if
the section governing a particular discovery motion requires to filing of a
declaration stating facts showing that an attempt at informal resolution has
been made.” (§ 2023.010, subds. (d), (f), (i).)
 
“A judicial
officer shall have the power to impose reasonable money sanctions, not to
exceed fifteen hundred dollars ($1,500), notwithstanding any other provision of
law, payable to the court, for any violation of a lawful court order by a
person, done without good cause or substantial justification. This power shall
not apply to advocacy of counsel before the court. For the purposes of this
section, the term ‘person’ includes a witness, a party, a party’s attorney, or
both.” (§ 177.5.)
 
A subpoena is
considered a court order under section 1985, which defines a subpoena as “a
writ or order directed to a person and requiring the person's attendance at a
particular time and place to testify as a witness.” (§ 1985.)
 
B.      Discussion
 
1.                 
Safeco Did
Not Respond to the Subpoena.
 
Under section 2025.480, subdivision¿(a), the Court finds that
Safeco did not produce any document specified within the deposition subpoena,
because Safeco failed to produce any documents at the location and date
specified on the subpoena. (Decl.
Redd ¶ 3.) Safeco also failed to produce any documents after Plaintiff
had granted them an extension. (Decl.
Redd ¶ 3.) The Court will grant the motion to compel if the motion was filed
timely and Plaintiff demonstrates a good faith attempt to meet and confer as
required under section 2025.480, subdivision (b). These requirements are met. 
 
2.                 
Motion Was
Filed Timely.
 
Because this
motion was made before the 60 days deadline, the motion was timely filed. 
 
Here,
Plaintiff filed the motion on November 13, 2024, and served the motion on Safeco
on November 19, 2024. (Motion p. 1; Decl. Redd Exh. A.) As discussed, the
deadline runs when the nonparty deponents assert objections and declines to
produce responsive documents. (In re Marriage of Moore, supra, 102
Cal.App.5th at 1287, citing Unzipped, supra, 156 Cal.App.4th at pp. 128,
131–136.) Safeco declined to produce the documents on September 23, 2024 by not
appearing at the scheduled location. (Decl. Redd ¶ 3.) Accordingly, Plaintiff
would have to file and serve the motion by November 22, 2024 per the 60-day
deadline. As Plaintiff served the motion on November 19, 2024, Plaintiff’s
motion was made before the 60-day deadline. 
 
Accordingly,
the Court finds that Plaintiff timely filed this motion. 
 
3.                 
Meet and
Confer Requirement Met.
 
Here,
Plaintiff has presented sufficient facts to demonstrate a good faith attempt to
meet and confer to solve the issues informally.
 
From September 24, 2024 to October 22, 2024, a deposition officer
attempted to obtain the documents requested in the subpoena after Safeco failed
to produce documents on the specified date. (Decl. Redd ¶ 5, Exh. B.) The
deposition officer called three times, September 24, October 1, and October 7,
2024, to speak with someone from Safeco. (Decl. Redd Exh. B.) The deposition
officer emailed Safeco about filing a motion to compel due to Safeco’s
incompliance. (Decl. Redd Exh. B.) On November 8, 2024, having not received the
requested documents, Plaintiff spoke with Safeco’s counsel about filing a
motion to compel should Safeco not produce the documents requested by November
12, 2024 at noon. (Decl. Redd ¶ 4.) Again, Safeco did not provide the requested
documents within the extension of time provided to avoid filing a motion.
(Decl. Redd ¶ 3.)
 
Accordingly,
the Court finds that Plaintiff satisfies the meet and confer requirement. 
 
As
all requirements are met, the Court GRANTS the Motion to Compel Production of Documents
from Non-Party Safeco Insurance Company of America. 
 
4.                 
Sanctions
 
Failing to
respond to an authorized method of discovery is a sanctionable misuse of the discovery
process under sections 2023.030 subd. (a), 2023.010 subd. (d). If a motion to
compel is successful, the court must impose a monetary sanction against
that party unless the sanction is unjust.
 
Here, the
facts described above, as well as Safeco’s failure to oppose Plaintiff’s motion,
justify the imposition of monetary sanctions against Safeco for misuse of the
discovery process. Plaintiff asks for $74.92
for the cost of filing this motion and the associated E-Filing Fee. (Motion
p. 6; Decl. Redd ¶ 7.) This amount is granted.
 
As discussed,
the Court may also impose a sanction for violating a lawful court order, including
a subpoena, by a person, done without good cause or substantial justification. (§§
177.5; 1985.) Here, Safeco did not comply with the order or provide cause or
substantial justification as to why they could not comply. Safeco did not serve
objections to the subpoena. Safeco simply said, “Defense Counsel in this case
has filed an interpleader to resolve this matter per Court Order, [and] therefore
we cannot respond to this Subpoena.” (Decl. Redd Exh. B.) Safeco’s lack of
communication with Plaintiff influenced the filing of this motion. Plaintiff
asks for sanctions be imposed against Safeco, a witness in this action, in the
amount of $1,500. However, the Court finds this amount to be excessive for their
first violation. The Court finds $250 reasonable. 
 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Request for Order Awarding Monetary
Sanctions Against Safeco Insurance Company of America in the Amount of $324.92.

 
III. DISPOSITION
 
The Court GRANTS the Motion to Compel Production of Documents
from Non-Party Safeco Insurance Company of America. Safeco is hereby ordered to
provide verified responses, without objections, to Plaintiff’s Deposition
Subpoena for Production of Business Records within 30 days of the date of this
order.
 
The Court further GRANTS Plaintiff’s Request for Order Awarding Monetary Sanctions Against Safeco Insurance
Company of America in the Amount of $324.92. $74.92
in
monetary sanctions is to be paid to Plaintiff within 30 days of the date of
this order. $250 in monetary
sanctions is to be paid to the Court within 30 days of the date of this order.
