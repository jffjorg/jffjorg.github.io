And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is in response to a motion by Progressive West Insurance Company (Petitioner) to compel Maxim Khromov (Respondent) to provide further responses to discovery requests. The Petitioner filed motions to compel further responses to Special Interrogatories, Set 1, and Demands for Production of Documents, Set 1. The Respondent has not opposed the motions. The Court finds that the Petitioner has engaged in a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of the issues presented in the motions.

The Court grants in part the Petitioner's motions to compel further responses and orders the Respondent to serve further verified and code compliant responses to the discovery requests without objections. The Court also imposes monetary sanctions of $1023.30 on the Respondent for failing to provide code compliant responses to the discovery requests.

The Court notes that the purpose of the discovery rules is to enhance the truth-seeking function of the litigation process and eliminate trial strategies that focus on gamesmanship and surprise. The Court also notes that a trial court's determination of a motion to compel discovery is reviewed for abuse of discretion.
