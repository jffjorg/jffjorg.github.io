[1] Although it appears Plaintiff served his opposition
on Defendant, Plaintiff did not effectively file his opposition with the Court.  Defendant supplied the Court with a copy of
Plaintiff’s opposition for the purpose of this analysis, but Plaintiff must
still file his opposition so that the electronic case record is complete.


[2] Because the Court finds this issue dispositive, it
does not reach the remainder of Defendant’s arguments presented in the
demurrer, and it determines that Defendant’s motion to strike punitive damages
claims is moot.
