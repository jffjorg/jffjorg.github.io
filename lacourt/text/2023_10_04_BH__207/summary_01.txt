```

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to compel arbitration in part, but denies it in part. The ruling also overrules the demurrer to the complaint. The judge finds that the parties' agreement to arbitrate the dispute in the First Case does not cover the dispute in this case, and that the claims in this case are not barred by the pendency of another action. The judge also finds that the stipulation to arbitrate the dispute in the First Case is enforceable, but that the claims in this case are not properly arbitrable because they exceed the scope of the parties' agreement to arbitrate.
