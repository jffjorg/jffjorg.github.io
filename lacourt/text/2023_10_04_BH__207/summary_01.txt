Intentions:

  - To demur to the complaint
Facts:
  - Bobs LLC loaned $2 Million and $1.635 Million to BHABC LLC and BHM LLC, respectively
  - Draz executed a guaranty on the loans
  - The parties agreed to arbitrate the dispute in the First Case
  - The parties also agreed to arbitrate the dispute in the arbitration proceedings
Disputes:
  - Whether the parties' agreement to arbitrate the dispute in the First Case also covers the dispute in this case
  - Whether the stipulation to arbitrate the dispute in the First Case is enforceable
  - Whether the claims in this case are barred by the pendency of another action
Laws:
  - California Code of Civil Procedure, sections 1281.2, 430.10, 452
  - Evidence Code, section 452
  - Civil Code, section 581
Statutes:
  - None
Roles:
  - Judge: Michael E. Whitaker
  - Plaintiff: Bobs LLC
  - Defendant: Michael Draz
Significant Statements:
  - "The advantages of arbitration include a presumptively less costly, more expeditious manner of resolving disputes."
  - "On a petition to compel arbitration, the trial court must first determine whether an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists."
  - "A cross-pleading creates an action distinct and separate from an initial pleading."
  - "Unless the parties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise, the question of whether the parties agreed to arbitrate is to be decided by the court, not the arbitrator."
```

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to compel arbitration in part, but denies it in part. The ruling also overrules the demurrer to the complaint. The judge finds that the parties' agreement to arbitrate the dispute in the First Case does not cover the dispute in this case, and that the claims in this case are not barred by the pendency of another action. The judge also finds that the stipulation to arbitrate the dispute in the First Case is enforceable, but that the claims in this case are not properly arbitrable because they exceed the scope of the parties' agreement to arbitrate.
