The judge is considering the case and has identified the key facts and legal principles at issue. The case involves the concept of "ultimate facts," which are those that constitute the cause of action or upon which liability depends. The judge notes that to survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action, and that the term "ultimate fact" refers to a core fact, such as an essential element of a claim. The judge is considering the case citations provided, including Doe v. City of Los Angeles, C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist., Central Valley General Hosp. v. Smith, and Rodriguez v. Parivar, Inc. The judge's ruling will likely be based on these legal principles and the facts of the case.
