## English Text Summary

This tentative ruling clarifies the standard for pleading "ultimate facts" in a civil complaint.  

The Judge emphasizes that to survive a demurrer (a motion to dismiss), a plaintiff need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action. They don't need to specify every piece of evidence they might use. 

The ruling explains that "ultimate facts" are essential elements of a claim, like duty of care, breach, and causation. These are different from evidentiary facts (specific details) or legal conclusions.


Essentially, the Judge is reminding the parties that the pleading stage focuses on the core elements of the case, not on every piece of supporting evidence.
