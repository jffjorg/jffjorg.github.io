## English Text Summary

This tentative ruling clarifies the standard for pleading "ultimate facts" in a civil complaint.  

The Judge emphasizes that to survive a demurrer (a motion to dismiss), a plaintiff need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action. They don't need to specify every piece of evidence they might use. 

The ruling explains that "ultimate facts" are essential elements of a claim, like duty of care, breach, and causation. These are different from evidentiary facts (specific details) or legal conclusions.


Essentially, the Judge is reminding the parties that the pleading stage focuses on the core elements of the case, not on every piece of supporting evidence.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a demurrer filed by the defendant and is examining the facts alleged in the complaint. The judge notes that ultimate facts are those that constitute the cause of action, such as duty of care, breach of duty, and causation (damages). The judge also notes that evidentiary facts need not be alleged at the pleading stage, and that the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action. The judge cites several case law examples to support this understanding, including Doe v. City of Los Angeles, C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist., Central Valley General Hosp. v. Smith, and Rodriguez v. Parivar, Inc. The judge's tentative ruling suggests that the complaint has adequately alleged the necessary ultimate facts and that the demurrer should be denied.

```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling discusses the concept of "ultimate facts" in the context of a demurrer. The Judge notes that ultimate facts are those that constitute the cause of action, such as duty of care, breach of duty, and causation. The Judge cites several cases, including Doe v. City of Los Angeles and C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist., to support the idea that a complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action, without requiring each evidentiary fact to be alleged. The Judge also distinguishes ultimate facts from evidentiary facts and legal conclusions, citing Central Valley General Hosp. v. Smith and Rodriguez v. Parivar, Inc. The ruling suggests that the plaintiff's complaint will be evaluated to determine whether it alleges sufficient ultimate facts to state a cause of action and survive a demurrer.
