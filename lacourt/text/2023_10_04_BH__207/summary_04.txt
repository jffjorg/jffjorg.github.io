**English Text Summary:**

This tentative ruling addresses a lawsuit filed by Hunter Nation, also known as Milo Senaca, against the Santa Monica Police Department (SMPD).  

The lawsuit alleges that the SMPD is liable for emotional distress because it failed to maintain an emergency phone system on Santa Monica beach, preventing Plaintiff from getting help during a sexual assault.  

However, the judge found that Plaintiff had previously filed a similar case against the SMPD alleging negligence for the same issue, and that case was dismissed with prejudice. This means the Plaintiff is legally barred from re-litigating the same issue. 

Therefore, the judge sustains the SMPD's demurrer to the lawsuit, meaning the case is dismissed, and denies Plaintiff the opportunity to amend the complaint.
