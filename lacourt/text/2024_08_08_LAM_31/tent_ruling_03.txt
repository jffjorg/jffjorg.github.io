            This is an

to pay premiums owed under an insurance Policy. 
On August 24, 2023, Plaintiff, Insurance Company of the West, filed a
Complaint against Defendant, Cold Systems, Inc., dba Super-Cool Refrigeration, and
Does 1-20, alleging that Plaintiff issued worker’s compensation insurance policy
number WSA-5044681-00 to Defendant.  During
the Policy Period, Defendant failed and refused to pay certain premiums due and
owing on the Policy.  There is currently
$32,361.88 due from Defendant to Plaintiff for the Policy Period.
 
            On December

            On June 5,

seeks a default judgment against Defendant in the sum of $34.852.20, consisting
of $32,361.88 as demanded in the Complaint and $2,490.32 in costs.  
 
Upon review, the court finds Plaintiff substantiates the
