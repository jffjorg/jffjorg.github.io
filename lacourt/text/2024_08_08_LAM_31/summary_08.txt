And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Mike Tehrani and Eskan Builders, Corp. v. Mehrdad Adjari. The case concerns the release of two mechanics liens recorded by Plaintiffs on the Property located at 12428 Laurel Terrace Drive, Studio City, California. Defendant Adjari filed petitions for release of the liens, alleging that Plaintiffs did not timely record the liens and did not commence an action to enforce the liens within the required time period.

The judge holds that the First Lien expired and is unenforceable because Plaintiffs did not commence an action to enforce the lien within 90 days of recording the lien. However, the judge continues the hearing to allow Defendant to cure defects in the petition.

The judge also denies Defendant's petition for release of the Second Lien, finding that there is a factual dispute about the completion date of the work on the Property. The judge orders Defendant to correct the defects in the petition and sets a new hearing date.

The judge also finds that the Demurrer is moot because Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint after the deadline for filing an opposition to the Demurrer.
