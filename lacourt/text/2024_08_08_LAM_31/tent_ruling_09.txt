[1] Plaintiffs also argue that the
notice of motion is defective and should be denied on this separate
ground.  The court is not persuaded.  “It is well settled that the appearance of a
party at the hearing of a motion and his or her opposition to the motion on its
merits is a waiver of any defects or irregularities in the notice of motion.
(Citations.) This rule applies even when no notice was given at all.
(Citations.) Accordingly, a party who appears and contests a motion in the
court below cannot object on appeal or by seeking extraordinary relief in the
appellate court that he had no notice of the motion or that the notice was
insufficient or defective.” (Tate v. Superior Court (1975) 45 Cal.App.3d
925, 930; see also Alliance Bank v. Murray (1984) 161 Cal.App.3d 1,
7–8.) Here, Plaintiffs filed an opposition to the Petition (and presumably will
appear at the hearing).  The challenge is
waived.


[2] The First Lien requests attorney’s
fees.  However, as Plaintiffs correctly
point out, the request was not included in the notice of the Petition for the
First Lien.  The same defect plagues
Defendant’s Petition for Release of [the Second] Mechanics Lien.


[3] In opposition to the Petition re
Second Lien, Plaintiffs point out that Civil Code section 3115 has been
repealed.  However, as indicate above,
the 90-day requirement is now codified at Civil Code section 8414.
