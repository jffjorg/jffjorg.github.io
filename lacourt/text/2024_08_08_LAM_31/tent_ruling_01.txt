MOTION
TO CONTINUE TRIAL



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant
Cynthia Makin
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendant/Cross-Complainant
George Cashman
 
 
I.          Background
 
This is a partition action concerning the real property
commonly known as 2 Crest Road East, Rolling Hills, County of Los Angeles,
California 90274 (the “Property”).  The
property is owned in equal parts by siblings Cynthia Makin (“Makin”) and George
Cashman (“Cashman”), as individuals and co-trustees of the GFC Administrative
Trust (the “Trust”).  
 
On December 29, 2022, Makin, in pro per, filed a Verified
Complaint for Partition in Kind of Real Property, against Cashman.  The Complaint seeks partition in kind of the
Property.
 
On April 28, 2023, Cashman filed a Verified Cross-Complaint,
seeking Partition by Sale of the Property, Declaratory Relief, and Accounting. 
 
            On August
16, 2023, the court scheduled a non-jury trial for August 26, 2024.  
 
            On March 7,
2024, Makin filed a Motion for Order for Appraisal of Real Property.  The court granted the motion on April 9, 2024
(the “Appraisal Order”). 
 
            On May 8,
2024, over Makin’s objection, the court appointed Charles Baker to conduct the
appraisal.
 
            On May 28,
2024, Cashman filed Mr. Baker’s appraisal report with the court.  Makin filed an Objection to the Appraisal
Report of Charles Baker   Accordingly,
the court set an evidentiary hearing for July 22, 2024 regarding the appraisal
report (hereafter, the “Valuation Hearing”).
 
            On July 22,
2024, the court reset the hearing to August 16, 2024 due to the court’s
system-wide outage.
 
            Motion
to Continue Trial
 
            On July 17,
2024, Makin filed this Motion to Continue Trial Date, Final Status Conference,
and Hearing on Order to Show Cause Re Partition Referee.
 
            Cashman
filed an opposition.  Makin replied.
 
            Trial is
currently scheduled for August 26, 2024. 
This is the first request for a trial continuance.
 
II.        Discussion
& Legal Standard 
 
            Makin moves
the court for an order continuing the trial date to April 1, 2025, to set all
related trial dates to the proposed date, and to likewise continue the Order to
Show Cause re Partition Referee.  Cashman
does not oppose a trial continuance but contends the continuance Makin seeks is
unreasonable.  Cashman counter-proposal
is to continue for seventy-five days.  In
reply, Makin offers a compromise of January 20, 2025.  For the reasons stated herein, the court
finds good cause exists to grant a trial continuance to April 1, 2025.
 
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(b) outlines that “a
party seeking a continuance of the date set for trial, whether contested or
uncontested or stipulated to by the parties, must make the request for a
continuance by a noticed motion or an ex parte application under the rules in
chapter 4 of this division, with supporting declarations.¿ The party must make
the motion or application as soon as reasonably practical once the necessity
for the continuance is discovered.”¿ 
 
Under California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c), the court
may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring
the continuance.  Circumstances that may indicate good cause include “a
party’s excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other
material evidence despite diligent efforts.”¿ The court should consider all
facts and circumstances relevant to the determination, such as proximity of the
trial date, prior continuances, prejudice suffered, whether all parties have
stipulated to a continuance, and whether the interests of justice are served.¿
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).)¿ 
  
            Here, Makin argues the Appraisal Order
and the court’s forthcoming ruling on the Valuation Hearing, will prompt
further orders and deadlines which will result in a significant, unanticipated
change in the status of the case.  In
support, Makin explains that, pursuant to the court’s ruling at the Valuation
Hearing, Makin may elect to purchase the Property 45 days after service of the
order from the Valuation Hearing.  If
Makin completes the sale, a trial on partition in kind will not be necessary.  
 
            The
argument has merit.  Code of Civil
Procedure (CCP) section 874.316(f) states, “If an appraisal is filed with the
court pursuant to subdivision (d), the court shall conduct a hearing to
determine the fair market value of the property not sooner than 30 days after a
copy of the notice of the appraisal is sent to each party under subdivision
(e), whether or not an objection to the appraisal is filed under paragraph (3)
of subdivision (e). In addition to the court-ordered appraisal, the court may
consider any other evidence of value offered by a party.”  
 
“After a hearing under subdivision (f), but before
considering the merits of the partition action, the court shall determine the
fair market value of the property and send notice to the parties of the value”.
 (CCP § 874.316(g).)  “If any cotenant requested partition by sale,
the court shall, after the determination of value under section 874.316, send
notice to the parties that any cotenant except a cotenant that requested
partition by sale may buy all the interests of the cotenants that requested
partition by sale. Not later than 45 days after the notice is sent under
subdivision (a), any cotenant except a cotenant that requested partition by
sale may give notice to the court that it elects to buy all the interests of
the cotenants that requested partition by sale.”   (CCP §
874.317(a), (b).)  Further, the “court
shall set a date, not sooner than 60 days after the date the notice was sent
[per subdivision (b)], by which electing cotenants shall pay their apportioned
price into the court.”  (CCP § 874.317(e).)
 
            Here, the
court set the Valuation Hearing pursuant to CCP section 874.316(f).  The Valuation Hearing is set to take place on
August 16, 2024.  If the court determines
the value of the Property on August 16, 2024, Makin must then serve notice of
election to purchase at the determined price within 45 days after the price is
noticed by the court.  After Makin’s
election has been served by the court, Makin has 60 days to complete the
purchase.  Makin’s deadline to complete
the purchase roughly lands in late November or early December.  As such, in the event Makin does not complete
the purchase, the case will not be ready for trial any earlier than January 20,
2025.  For this reason, Cashman’s proposed
75-day continuance is unworkable.  
 
Given that Cashman does not oppose a continuance, does not
dispute Makin’s timeline of events, and further, the court’s impacted calendar
prevents setting this trial (expected to require at least two days) on January
21, 2025[1]
, the court finds goods cause exists to continue the trial date to April 1,
2025, and to set all trial-related dates to that date.  The court further finds good cause exists to
continue the Order to Show Cause re Partition Referee.
 
IV.       Conclusion
 
The motion is GRANTED.  The Final Status Conference scheduled for August
13, 2024 is CONTINUED to March 18, 2025 at 10:00 AM.¿ The Non-Jury Trial
scheduled for August 26, 2024 is CONTINUED to April 1, 2025 at 8:30 AM.¿ All
discovery cut-off dates, all pretrial deadlines including discovery, expert,
and motion cut-off dates are continued to the new trial date of April 1,
2025.  The Order to Show Cause re: Appointment of a Partition Referee
scheduled for August 16, 2024, is CONTINUED to March 4, 2025 at 9:00 AM.
