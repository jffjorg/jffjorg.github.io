[1] Nevertheless, Defendants argue that
Plaintiff should not be awarded any additional fees and costs.  The argument is not well taken.  Under the terms of the settlement, Defendants
agreed to “not dispute Plaintiff’s underlying entitlement to attorneys’ fees
and costs based upon the claim(s) in the Action.”  (COE, Ex. 3, ¶ B.5.)  Having
expressly agreed to some award, Defendants cannot now argue otherwise.  
 
Defendants
do not stop there.  Defendants also argue
that Plaintiff should not have been awarded fees in connection with her Motion
to Compel Arbitration Fees and Costs.  In
support, Defendants cite Hernandez v. Sohnen Enterprises, Inc. (2024)
102 Cal.App.5th 222 for the proposition that the Federal Arbitration Act prevents
a plaintiff from withdrawing a case from arbitration for a defendant’s failure
to timely pay arbitration fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
1281.97.  Defendants’ argument lacks
merit.  Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel
Arbitration Fees and Costs is not at issue here.  Further, as stated in Plaintiff’s counsel’s
declaration, and as noted in the billing entries, Plaintiff is not seeking fees
duplicative of the Motion to Compel Arbitration Fees.  (See Barry Decl., ¶ 7; see also COE, Ex.
4.)  Accordingly, the court does not
express any view on Hernandez and its relation to the court’s previous
ruling granting Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Arbitration Fees and Costs.
