I.          INTRODUCTION

 
On April 20, 2023, Plaintiff, Giselle Maciel, filed a consumer
arbitration demand against Defendant CarMax Auto Superstores, Inc. (“CarMax”)
with JAMS.  On July 26, 2023, JAMS issued
to CarMax an invoice for payment of arbitration fees.  Payment was requested by August 26, 2023.  Plaintiff inquired whether CarMax had timely
paid the invoice.  On September 27, 2023,
JAMS confirmed they had not received payment from CarMax.  On September 30, 2023, Plaintiff notified JAMS
of her election to withdraw her case from arbitration and proceed in court
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1291.98(b)(1).  Thereafter, JAMS confirmed receipt of
Plaintiff’s request and closed its file on the arbitration.
 
On October 11, 2023, Plaintiff filed her Complaint against
CarMax, CarMax Business Services, LLC, and Safeco Insurance Company of America
(collectively, “Defendants”) in this court.
 
Thereafter, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Compel Arbitration
Fees and Costs.  The court granted the
motion on February 6, 2024.  Plaintiff
was awarded $7,875.
 
On April 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Settlement.
 
Plaintiff now moves for an order awarding Plaintiff
$29,469.50 in attorney’s fees and $1,426.61 in costs.
 
Defendants filed an opposition.  Plaintiff replied. 
 
II.        DISCUSSION
 
             Plaintiff
seeks a total award of $30,896.11, consisting of $29,469.50 in attorney’s fees
and $1,426.61 in costs.   
 
On April 11, 2024, the parties agreed to settle the
matter. ¿ The settlement provides for attorney’s fees and costs by
motion.  (Compendium of Exhibits (COE), Ex. 3, ¶ B.5.) 
 
Civil Code section 1794, subdivision (d) provides: 
 
(d)
If the buyer prevails in an action under this section, the buyer shall be
allowed by the court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the
aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on
actual time expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably
incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and prosecution
of such action. 
 
(Emphasis added.) 
  
           
The parties do not dispute that Plaintiff is the prevailing party under the
Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.  Accordingly, Plaintiff is entitled to
an award of reasonable attorney fees and costs as the prevailing party.[1] 
The only matter at issue is the reasonableness of the fees and costs requested.
  
Attorney Fees  
 
The determination of reasonable amount of attorney fees is
within the sound discretion of trial courts.  (PLCM Group v. Drexler
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095; Akins v. Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. (2000)
79 Cal.App.4th 1127, 1134.) “The determination of what constitutes a reasonable
fee generally ‘begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably
expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate….’”  “[T]he lodestar is
the basic fee for comparable legal services in the community; it may be adjusted
by the court based on factors including, as relevant herein, (1) the novelty
and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting
them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other
employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee
award….”  (Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144
Cal.App.4th 140, 154.)  In setting the hourly rate for an attorney fees
award, courts are entitled to consider the rate of “‘fees customarily charged by
that attorney and others in the community for similar work.’”  (Bihun
v. AT&T Information Systems, Inc. (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 976, 997
[affirming rate of $450 per hour], overruled on other grounds by Lakin v.
Watkins Associated Indus. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 644, 664.)  The burden is
on the party seeking attorney fees to prove reasonableness of the fees.  (Center
for Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th
603, 615.) 
 
The court has broad discretion in determining the amount of
a reasonable attorney’s fee award which will not be overturned absent a
“manifest abuse of discretion, a prejudicial error of law, or necessary
findings not supported by substantial evidence.”  (Bernardi v.
County of Monterey (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1393-94.)  The Court
need not explain its calculation of the amount of attorney’s fees awarded in
detail; identifying the factors considered in arriving at the amount will
suffice.  (Ventura v. ABM Industries Inc. (2012) 212 Cal.App.4th
258, 274-75.) 
 
1.     
Reasonable
Hourly Rate¿ 
 
Plaintiff retained Auto Fraud Legal Center LLP for this
matter which involved work by attorneys Christopher P. Barry, Gregory T.
Babbit, Josh Green, Michael A. Klitzke, Nathan Kiyam, Kathy Pham, and Ahmed
Yousef.  (Barry Decl., ¶ 7.)¿ Plaintiff seeks a blended average hourly
rate of $433.38.  (Barry Decl., ¶ 6.)¿
 
Defendants do not challenge the reasonableness of
Plaintiff’s counsels’ hourly billing rates.  Based upon general
prevailing rates in the Los Angeles area for this type of litigation, and the
lack of opposition to Plaintiff’s counsels’ hourly rates, the court finds the
foregoing blended rate to be reasonable. 
   
2.     
Number of
Hours Reasonably Expended¿ 
 
Plaintiff’s records reflect a total of 68 hours billed.¿(Barry
Decl., ¶ 6; COE, Ex. 4.) 
¿ 
“[I]t is the burden of the challenging party to point to the
specific items challenged [within the moving party’s verified billing invoice],
with a sufficient argument and citations to evidence.¿ General arguments that
fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice.”¿ (Lunada
Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 488.)¿¿¿ 
¿ 
Defendants object to Plaintiff’s counsels’ fees and costs as
duplicative and excessive.¿ (Opp., pp. 4-6.)¿ Without adequately identifying
which entries are objectionable, Defendants contend the fees and costs sought
here are duplicative of Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Arbitration Fees and
Costs.  Defendants also object to the
amount of billing given that Plaintiff did not propound any discovery and Plaintiff’s
counsels’ oppositions to Defendants’ demurrer and motion to strike in this
matter are nearly identical to oppositions Plaintiff’s counsel has prepared in other
cases.  This court agrees with some of these observations.¿¿¿ 
¿ 
The court notes that this case did not progress towards
trial.¿ Indeed, no trial date was ever set. 
Along the way, Plaintiff did not propound any written discovery. There
was little law and motion practice beyond Defendants’ demurrer and motion to
strike and Plaintiff’s initial fees and costs motion.¿  
 
Moreover, there was nothing particularly complex or unique
about this case.¿ The issues involved were applicable to other consumers’
vehicles, thereby triggering economies of scale in terms of Plaintiff’s
counsel’s efficiency in litigating this type of lemon law case.¿ The court also
notes this case settled exactly six months after it was filed. 
 
Considering these facts, the court agrees that in some
instances, the time quoted is excessive or unreasonable under the
circumstances.¿¿ 
¿ 
Based on the foregoing, and in view of the totality of the
circumstances, the court finds that the total amount of reasonable attorney’s
fees in this case, using a lodestar methodology, is $17,335.20.¿ This was
calculated by multiplying the hourly rate of $433.38 by 40 hours out of 68
hours billed, which the court deems to be the total amount of reasonable
attorney’s fees expended in this matter. 

 
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
            Plaintiff
is awarded $18,761.81, consisting of $17,335.20 in attorney’s fees and
$1,426.61 in costs.   
 
Plaintiff to give notice.
