And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses several issues related to a petition for a mechanics lien. The judge notes that the plaintiff's notice of motion is defective, but since the plaintiff appeared and contested the motion, they have waived any defects or irregularities in the notice. The judge also finds that the defendant's petition for release of the second mechanics lien is similarly defective. Additionally, the judge notes that the plaintiff's opposition to the petition for the second mechanics lien raises an issue about the sufficiency of notice, but finds that the plaintiff has waived this objection as well. The judge points out that the plaintiff's request for attorney's fees was not included in the notice of the petition, and that the defendant's petition for release of the second mechanics lien also fails to include such a request.
