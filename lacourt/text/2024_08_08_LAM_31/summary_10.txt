Summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Kerry Bensinger in the case of Hong Jin and Ming Zhou (Plaintiffs) against Dragon Dream LLC and Mingyong Huang (Defendants) regarding an Ex Parte Application for Right to Attach Order and Order for Issuance of Writ of Attachment. The Plaintiffs entered into an agreement with Bo Wang and Dragon Dream, LLC to acquire a 25% interest in a commercial property, but later realized they were misled into entering into the agreement. The Defendants seek to attach Bo Wang's property to recover on their cross-complaint against him. The Judge denied the Ex Parte Application for several reasons, including that the application was improperly filed, Defendants failed to show irreparable harm or immediate danger, and they did not provide a reasonably adequate description of the property to be attached.
