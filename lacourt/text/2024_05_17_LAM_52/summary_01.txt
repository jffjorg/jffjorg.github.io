The judge's tentative ruling is a response to the plaintiff's failure to obtain a default judgment against the defendants, Advance Pipe Bending and Mitchell McCray, within the required 45-day period.

The court has continued the order to show cause re: entry of default judgment to July 11, 2024, and has given the plaintiff until July 1, 2024, to file a complete default judgment application.
