And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"In this case, defendant Propark America West, LLC moves to compel arbitration of plaintiff Nancy Benavides's individual PAGA claim and stay representative PAGA claims. Plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that the parties' agreement contains an unenforceable waiver of the right to bring a representative PAGA action. However, the court finds that the parties' agreement delegates to the arbitrator the power to rule on gateway issues, including arbitrability. Therefore, the court grants defendant's motion to compel arbitration of the individual PAGA claim and stays the representative PAGA claims. The court orders plaintiff to arbitrate her disputes with defendant, including gateway issues of arbitrability and the scope of the arbitration agreement, but not including plaintiff's representative PAGA claims. The court hereby stays the entire action pending resolution of the arbitration proceeding."
