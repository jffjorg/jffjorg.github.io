  Case Number:  23STCV00076    Hearing Date:   May 17, 2024    Dept:  52 Order to Show Cause Re: Entry of Default Judgment 
            Plaintiff
Salvador Lopez, Jr. brings an action against defendants Advance Pipe Bending, a
business entity form unknown, and Mitchell McCray.  Both defendants have defaulted.  California Rules of Court, rule 3.110(h) provides,
“When a default is entered, the party who requested the entry of default
must obtain a default judgment against the defaulting party within 45 days
after the default was entered, unless the court has granted an extension of
time.  The court may issue an order to
show cause why sanctions should not be imposed if that party fails to obtain
entry of judgment against a defaulting party or to request an extension of time
to apply for a default judgment within that time.”
            The
clerk entered the defaults of defendants Advance Pipe Bending and Mitchell
McCray on March 19, 2024.  More than 45
days have passed.  Plaintiff did not
timely request entry of default judgment against defendants.  The court, however, exercises its discretion
not to issue an order to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed.
The
court hereby discharges the order to show cause re: why plaintiff should not pay $100 in
sanctions under rule 3.110(g).  
The court hereby continues the order to show cause
re: entry of default judgment to July 11, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.  Plaintiff shall file a complete default
judgment application including all documents listed in California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1800(a), no later than July 1, 2024.
