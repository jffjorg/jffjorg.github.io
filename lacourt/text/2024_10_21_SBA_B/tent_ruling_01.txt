  Case Number:  23TRCV00549    Hearing Date:   October 21, 2024    Dept:  B EDWARD HICKS vs CATALINA NAVA, et al., Case No. 23TRCV00549
andNATIONS INSURANCE COMPANY vs EDWARD LEE HICKS, et al.,
Case No. 23TRCV03532 These two actions have been related.  In Hick v. Nava Plaintiff seeks to recover
for injuries he claims to have suffered from an auto accident involving
Nava.  In Nations Insurance it seeks to
have the Court determine in a declaratory relief action that its liability is
capped at $15,000/$30,000 and that it is not potentially liable for excess
damages based on Hicks’ claim that a May 18, 2023 demand from counsel for Hicks
constituted a demand in compliance with Code
of Civil Procedure § 999.1 potentially opening Nations Insurance to liability
in excess of its coverage limits.Before the Court on October 21, 2024 is the Motion of
Nations Insurance to stay Hicks v. Nava. 
 (Nava has filed a Non-Opposition
to the stay motion.)  Coming up on
October 29, 2024 is a Motion of Hicks for preferential setting based on Code of Civil Procedure § 36.  However, Hicks opposes the Motion for Stay on
the basis of his request for preferential setting.  Thus these are “dueling motions.”Nations Insurance seeks to stay the Hicks action pending resolution
of its declaratory relief action.  It
contends that the impediment to settling the Hicks action is Hick’s claim that Nations
Insurance is liable for excess damages over and above its $15,000/$30,000 policy
limits.The Court can accommodate the desires of both parties.The Court advances the October 29, 2024 motion for
preference of Hicks to be heard on October 21, 2024 with the Motion for a Stay.Hicks filed his action on February 24, 2023.  On June 26, 2023 Judge Hill set the matter
for trial on January 29, 2025 with a post mediation status conference scheduled
for May 28, 2024.  (On May 28, 2024
Plaintiff’s counsel informed the Court that the parties had not complied with
Judge Hill’s order and had not mediated by that date.  Defense counsel failed to appear, which is
unacceptable to the Court.)The Court may assume that the Hicks trial is nearly ready
for trial.  The requested Code of Civil Procedure § 36 preference
would mandate a trial date within 120 days. 
That date (based on the October 29, 2024 hearing date on the motion) is
February 26, 2025.  The present trial
date falls within that preference time period.The Nations insurance case was filed October 24, 2023 and a
general denial was filed January 19, 2024. 
That case should be ready for trial based on the obligation that courts
conduct trials within a year of filing.  The
Case Management Conference Statements filed by the parties suggests that they
shall be prepared for trial.  Further, it
appears that the case is relatively simple, involving an analysis of the February
24, 2023 demand letter and the applicable law, as well as the claim that Hicks
failed to produce to Nations Insurance any materials to allow it to fairly
evaluate the claim during the relevant February – March 2023 time period.Therefore, the Court makes the following Order:1.  The Motion to Stay
the Hicks action is DENIED.2.  The Trial of the
Nations Insurance case is set for December 3, 2024 at 9:30 a.m.  A Final Status Conference shall be held on
November 22, 2024 at 9:00 a.m.  The
parties shall deliver to the Court no later than November 20, 2024 their exhibit
lists, witness lists, full set of exhibits, and shall file Trial Briefs with a
full explanation of the relevant facts and law.3.  The motion seeking
preference under Code of Civil Procedure
§ 36 is GRANTED.  The trial date is
vacated and reset to February 17, 2025 at 10:00 a.m..  The Final Status Conference shall be on
February 7, 2025 at 9:00 a.m.  The
parties shall comply fully with the Court’s Trial Preparation Order previously
issued.





























4.  Nations Insurance
v. Hicks (which was previously “related” to Hicks v. Nava and assigned to Judge
Douglas W. Stern in May 2024) is ordered transferred back to and again assigned
to Judge Douglas W. Stern.
