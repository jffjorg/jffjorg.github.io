And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to stay the Hicks action, which was filed by Nations Insurance. Nations Insurance sought to stay the action pending the resolution of its declaratory relief action, which it claims is necessary to determine its liability for excess damages. The judge has also granted Hicks' motion for preferential setting, which will result in a trial date of February 17, 2025. The judge has set the trial date for the Nations Insurance case to December 3, 2024, and has scheduled a final status conference for November 22, 2024. The parties are ordered to deliver their exhibit lists, witness lists, and full set of exhibits by November 20, 2024, and to file trial briefs with a full explanation of the relevant facts and law.
