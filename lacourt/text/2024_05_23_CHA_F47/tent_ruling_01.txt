for the principal amount of $4,094.39 plus 12% interest, as to the personal
line of credit loan.  (See

Additionally, the Court ordered that costs were to be determined by the
timely filing of a Memorandum of Costs and attorneys’ fees to be
determined/awarded per motion.  Id.

motion seeking an order awarding Plaintiff attorney’s fees in the amount of
$16,975.00 as the prevailing party after judgment on a contract claim.  Defendant has not opposed or otherwise

ANALYSIS
 
Civil Code 1717 provides, in relevant part: 
 
“(a) In any action on a contract,
where the contract specifically provides that attorney's fees and costs, which
are incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of
the parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be
the party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she is the party
specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's
fees in addition to other costs.
Where a contract provides for
attorney's fees, as set forth above, that provision
shall be construed as applying to the entire contract, unless each party was
represented by counsel in the negotiation and execution of the contract, and
the fact of that representation is specified in the contract.
 
Reasonable attorney's fees shall be
fixed by the court, and shall be an element of the costs of suit.
 
Attorney's fees provided for by
this section shall not be subject to waiver by the parties to any contract
which is entered into after the effective date of this section. Any provision
in any such contract which provides for a waiver of attorney's fees is void.
 
(b)(1) The court, upon notice and
motion by a party, shall determine who is the party prevailing on the contract for purposes of this section,
whether or not the suit proceeds to final judgment. Except as provided in
paragraph (2), the party prevailing on the contract shall be the party
who recovered a greater relief in the action on
the contract. The court may also determine that there is no party prevailing on
the contract for purposes of this section.”  
 
When a party obtains an unqualified victory by completely
prevailing on, or defeating, all contract claims and the contract provides for
attorneys’ fees, Civil Code 1717 entitles the prevailing party to recover
reasonable attorneys’ fees.  Scott Co.
of California (1999) 20 C4th 1103, 1109; Hsu (1995) 9 C4th 863,
865-866
 
Both of the contracts which underlie the claims on which
Plaintiff prevailed at trial include attorney fee provisions which provide that
Defendant agrees to pay for all court costs and reasonable attorney’s fees
incurred in the course of collecting amounts owed under the contracts.  (See Anaya Decl. ¶3, Ex.A ¶8, Ex.B,
p.2 “Collection Costs”).
 
As the prevailing party on the contract claims based on
contracts which contained attorney fee provisions, Plaintiff is entitled to
recover its reasonable attorney’s fees.
 
The Court finds that the $350 per hour claimed by
Plaintiff’s counsel to be reasonable. 
(Anaya Decl. ¶4).  However, the
Court finds that Plaintiff is not reasonably entitled to recover the fees
incurred in relation to Plaintiff’s failed motion for summary judgment and
failed motion to compel deposition.  (See
Anaya Decl. ¶5; 6/27/23 Minute Order denying MSJ; 9/21/23 Minute Order denying
Motion to Compel Further Deposition).  As
such, the Court has deducted 13.4 hours from the 48.5 hours claimed.  Plaintiff is awarded $12,285.00 in reasonable
attorney’s fees (35.1 hours multiplied by $350/hour).  (See Anaya Decl. ¶5). 
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted. 
Plaintiff is awarded $12,285.00 in attorney’s fees against
Defendant.
