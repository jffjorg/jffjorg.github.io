SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiff Jana Burkholder’s
(Plaintiff) tenancy from on or about 3/28/20 to on or about 5/15/23 in an
apartment allegedly owned, controlled and/or managed by Defendant PMI Cielo LLC
(Defendant).  Plaintiff alleges that
during her tenancy the apartment suffered from numerous habitability issues
that negatively impacted her health and eventually led to her moving out of the
apartment.
 
On 9/12/23, Plaintiff filed this action against Defendant
for: (1) Tortious Breach of Implied Warranty of Habitability – Violations of
Civil Code 1941; (2) Breach of Contract – Civil Code 3300, et seq.; (3) Breach
of Quiet Enjoyment – Civil Code 1927; (4) Private Nuisance – Civil Code 3501,
et seq.; (5) Premises Liability – Civil Code 1714; (6) Retaliation; (7) Negligence;

(8) Retaliatory Eviction; (9) Constructive Eviction; (10)
Violation of Civil Code 1940.2; 
(11) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; (12) Negligent
Infliction of Emotional Distress; (13) Violation of Business and Professions
Code 17200, et seq.; (14) Fraud; and (15) Violation of Civil Code 1950.5.  The parties were unable to resolve the issues
Defendant has with the complaint; therefore, on 2/2/24, Defendant filed and
electronically served the instant demurrer to the 1st – 6th
and 8th – 15th causes of action in the complaint on the
grounds that the complaint fails to state sufficient facts to constitute any of
these causes of action and each of these causes of action is uncertain.  CCP 430.10(e), (f).  Defendant also filed and served a motion to
strike portions of the complaint regarding punitive
damages (¶15, p.7:6; ¶66, p.13:21-23; ¶75, p.14:24-27; ¶94, p.17:8-9; ¶95,
p.17:10-16; Prayer ¶C, p.18:7-8); physical and mental discomfort in the 2nd
cause of action (¶28, p.9:3-5); and request for monetary damages in the 13th
cause of action (¶86, p.16:5-11).

 
The demurrer and motion to strike were originally
scheduled for hearing on 4/11/24.  On
4/3/24, 3 court days late, Plaintiff filed and electronically served an
opposition to the demurrer and a non-opposition to the motion to strike.  See CCP 1005(b).  Due to the late filing and service of the
opposition and lack of reply, the hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike
were continued to 5/23/24 to allow for the filing of a reply.  On 5/8/24, Defendant filed and served a reply
to the opposition to the demurrer.  
 
ANALYSIS 
  
 
As noted above, Plaintiff has filed a non-opposition to
the motion to strike.  Additionally, in
the opposition to the demurrer, Plaintiff withdraws the 8th, 10th,
12th and 13th causes of action in the complaint.  Therefore, the Court will not address those
arguments in the analysis.
 
1st cause of action – Breach of Implied
Warranty of Habitability
 
In the demurrer/moving papers, Defendants cites no
authority to support its argument that Plaintiff must specify which of the two
lease agreements alleged in the complaint underlies this cause of action.  (See Demurrer, p.11:20-5).  Further, based on the allegations in the
complaint regarding when certain conditions occurred which are incorporated
into the cause of action, it can be discerned which lease was in place during
the conditions complained of.  (See
Complaint ¶¶9-11, 17-18, 20).     
 
2nd cause of action – Breach of Contract
 
The elements of a breach of contract cause of action are:
(1) the existence of a contract, (2) the plaintiff’s performance or excuse for
non-performance, (3) defendant’s breach and (4) resulting damage.  Otworth (1985) 166 CA3d 452, 459.  
 
Defendant concedes that Plaintiff has alleged the
existence of two lease agreements which are attached as Exhibits A and B to the
complaint.  (See Demurrer,
p.12:18).  As with the breach of implied
warranty of habitability claim, based on the allegations regarding when certain
conditions occurred which are incorporated into this cause of action, Defendant
can ascertain which lease/contract is at issue for each complaint.  (See Complaint ¶¶9-11, 25).  Similarly, these incorporated allegations are
sufficiently specific to establish how Defendant allegedly breached the
contracts/leases at issue.  (Id.
and ¶27).
 
3rd cause of action – Breach of Quiet
Enjoyment
 
As with the 1st and 2nd causes of
action, the allegations incorporated into this cause of action are sufficient
to establish which of the two leases underlie this claim.  It is also noted that the second lease renewed
on a month-to-month basis after the expiration of the fixed term and,
therefore, was in place when Plaintiff alleges she was constructively evicted
on 5/15/23.  (See Complaint , Ex.B
¶3).  Since this cause of action did not
arise until Plaintiff’s alleged constructive eviction, it is not entirely
duplicative of the breach of contract claim. 
Petroleum Collections, Inc. (1975) 48 CA3d 841, 846.  
 
4th cause of action – Private Nuisance
 
The basis for the private nuisance cause of action is
unclear.  The complaint cites civil code 3501
which merely sets forth the remedies (a civil action or abatement) for a
private nuisance.  The opposition contends
that the claim is brought pursuant to Civil Code 1927 which already forms the
basis for the 3rd cause of action. 
(See Opposition, p.4:24-25). 
The allegations in the cause of action also appear to be based on the
same allegations as the 3rd cause of action making the claim
unnecessarily duplicative.  See El Escorial Owners’ Association
(2007) 154 CA4th 1337, 1348-1349; (Complaint ¶¶34-36).   
 
5th cause of action – Premises Liability
 
Plaintiff concedes that the elements of a premises
liability cause of action are the same as for negligence: duty, breach,
causation and damages.  (See
Opposition, p.5:14-15).  Plaintiff fails
to address the fact that the allegations in the premises liability cause of
action are essentially the same those in the 7th cause of action for
negligence, which is not challenged in this demurrer.  As such, the 5th cause of action
appears to be unnecessarily duplicative. 
See El Escorial Owners’ Association, supra.    
 
6th cause of action – Retaliation
 
While Plaintiff has withdrawn the 8th cause of
action for retaliatory eviction, it appears that Plaintiff intends to state
such a claim within the 6th cause of action as the opposition argues
that “California recognizes two independent sources for the doctrine of
retaliatory eviction, one statutory and one common law.”  (See Opposition, p.5:28-p.6:1).  Plaintiff then cites to Civil Code 1942.5(d)
(mistakenly referred to as 1945(d) in the opposition) which provides: 
 
“Notwithstanding subdivision (a),
it is unlawful for a lessor to increase rent, decrease services, cause a lessee
to quit involuntarily, bring an action to recover possession, or threaten to do
any of those acts, for the purpose of retaliating against the lessee because
the lessee has lawfully organized or participated in a lessees' association or
an organization advocating lessees' rights or has lawfully and peaceably
exercised any rights under the law. In an action brought by or against the
lessee pursuant to this subdivision, the lessee shall bear the burden of
producing evidence that the lessor's conduct was, in fact, retaliatory.” 
 
However, in the 6th cause of action, Plaintiff
cites Civil Code 1942.5(a) and (c).  (See
Complaint, p.11:7-8).  As such, the basis
for the claim is unclear – is Plaintiff making a claim for retaliatory/constructive
eviction or is Plaintiff claiming Defendant retaliated against her is some
other way (i.e., Civil Code 1942.5(c) relates to reporting or threatening to
report the lessee or individuals associated with the lessee to immigration).   
 
9th cause of action – Constructive Eviction
 
While the opposition argues that this cause of action is a
separate and independent cause of action brought pursuant to Civil Code 1940.2,
based on the allegations in the complaint, it is not clear how this claim
differs from the 6th cause of action which Plaintiff claims in the
opposition is one for retaliatory eviction. 
As such, the claims appear to be duplicative.  
 
11th cause of action – Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress
 
The elements of an intentional infliction of emotional
distress cause of action are: (1) extreme and outrageous conduct by the
defendant; (2) the defendant’s intention of causing or reckless disregard of
the probability of causing emotional distress; (3) the plaintiff’s suffering
severe or extreme emotional distress; and (4) actual and proximate causation of
the emotional distress injuries by the defendant's outrageous conduct.  Hughes (2009) 46 C4th 1035, 1050.  To be considered “severe,” the emotional distress
must be “of such substantial quantity or enduring quality that no reasonable
(person) in a civilized society should be expected to endure it.” Fletcher
(1970) 10 CA3d 376, 397.  To be
considered “outrageous,” a defendant’s conduct must be so extreme as to exceed
all bounds tolerated in a civilized community. 
Id.
 
Plaintiff has failed to allege facts which show the type of
extreme and outrageous conduct by Defendant which is necessary to support a
claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.  As noted above, the bases for Plaintiff’s
retaliation/retaliatory eviction and constructive eviction claims are
uncertain.  Additionally, Plaintiff has
alleged that Defendant attempted repairs regarding habitability complaints.
 
14th cause of action – Fraud
 
The elements of a fraud cause of action are: (1) a
knowingly false representation by the defendant; (2) an intent to deceive or
induce reliance; (3) justifiable reliance by the plaintiff; and (4) resulting
damages.  See Service by
Medallion, Inc. (1996) 44 CA4th 1807, 1816; Wilhelm (1986) 186 CA3d
1324, 1332.  A fraud claim must be pled
with factual specificity including facts showing “how, when, where, to whom,
and by what means the representations were tendered.” Lazar (1996) 12 C4th
631, 645.  As against a corporate entity,
the plaintiff must plead facts alleging “the names of the persons who made the
allegedly fraudulent representations, their authority to speak, to whom they
spoke, what they said or wrote, and when it was said or written.”  Id. 

 
Even with the incorporation of the prior allegations,
Plaintiff has failed to plead the fraud claim with the requisite factual
specificity.  It is not clear exactly
what misrepresentations were made to Plaintiff, when, who made the
misrepresentations and that person’s or persons’ authority to speak on behalf
of Defendant.  (See Complaint
¶90).  
 
15th cause of action – Violation of Civil
Code 1950.5
 
Plaintiff merely alleges that Defendant has failed to
return the security deposit in violation of Civil Code 1950.5 but fails to
state what specific conduct of Defendant violated Civil Code 1950.5 (i.e., Did
Defendant fail to provide Plaintiff with an itemized statement indicating why
the security deposit was not returned? Was the itemization incorrect? Etc.)  See Civil Code 1950.5(b), (e), (g);
(Complaint ¶¶16, 92).
 
CONCLUSION
 
Based on Plaintiff’s withdrawal of these causes of
action, the demurrer as to the 8th, 10th, 12th
and 13th causes of action is sustained without leave to amend.  
 
The demurrer as to the 1st, 2nd and
3rd causes of action is overruled.
 
The demurrer as to the 4th, 5th, 6th,
9th, 11th, 14th and 15th causes of
action is sustained with leave to amend. 
Due to the liberal policy of allowing leave to amend and because this is
only the original complaint, Plaintiff is given the opportunity to try to cure
the defects in these causes of action.
 
Due to Plaintiff’s notice of non-opposition to the motion
to strike, Defendant’s request to strike  portions of the complaint regarding punitive
damages (¶15, p.7:6; ¶66, p.13:21-23; ¶75, p.14:24-27; ¶94, p.17:8-9; ¶95,
p.17:10-16; Prayer ¶C, p.18:7-8); physical and mental discomfort in the 2nd
cause of action (¶28, p.9:3-5); and request for monetary damages in the 13th
cause of action (¶86, p.16:5-11) is granted without leave to amend.
 
A First Amended Complaint is due within 30 days.
