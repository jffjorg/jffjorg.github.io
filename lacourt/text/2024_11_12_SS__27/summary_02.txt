The proposed settlement provides a gross settlement of $1,000, which will be distributed as follows: $70.65 for medical expenses, $250 for attorneys' fees, and $230.57 for costs. The net balance of $448.78 will be awarded to the claimant. The court has reviewed the petition and determined that all required information has been provided and all necessary attachments have been filed. The judge finds the settlement and attorney's fees fair and reasonable. The court sets an order to show cause regarding compliance with payment on a future date.
