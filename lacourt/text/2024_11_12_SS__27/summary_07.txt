The deposition is subject to being compelled, but the judge finds that some of the requested documents are likely subject to the attorney-client privilege. The defendant may withhold documents and decline to answer specific deposition questions based on the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, and other asserted protections, provided it produces a privilege log for the withheld documents. The judge also denies the requests for sanctions, finding a legitimate dispute regarding the applicability of these privileges.
