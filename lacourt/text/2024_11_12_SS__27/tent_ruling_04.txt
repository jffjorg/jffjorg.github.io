SALOMY LEE vs KEVIN ALFRDO ESPINOZA, et al.
Moving Party: Plaintiff’s Counsel
Gary Dordick  
Responding Party: Unopposed  
Notice: Sufficient  
  
Ruling: COURT WILL HEAR FROM
PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL RE MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AND OSC RE DEFAULT. 
  
Background 
 
Attorney Gary Dordick represents
Plaintiff. Dordick moves to be relieved as counsel, citing an irremediable
breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. No opposition has been filed. 
 
Legal Standard¿ 
¿ 
The Court has discretion to allow
an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided that
there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process
of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People
v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 403-407.) 
¿ 
A motion to be relieved as counsel
must be made on Judicial Council Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion),
MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) The requisite forms must be served “on the
client and on all parties that have appeared in the case.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1362, subd. (d).) 
¿ 
Analysis and Conclusion¿ 
¿ 
Dordick has filed Judicial Council
Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053
(Proposed Order). Dordick seeks to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff on the
grounds that there has been a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship.
The Court finds this to be proper grounds for withdrawal. (See Estate of
Falco (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014 (a breakdown in the attorney-client
relationship is grounds for allowing the attorney to withdraw). Further, within the past 30 days, Plaintiff’s
address was confirmed as current by counsel via phone call. 
 
The next scheduled hearing date is
an OSC re Entry of Default set for November 14, 2024. The Court hereby advances
that OSC to today and will consider that OSC and hear from the parties re this
motion at 1:30 p.m.
