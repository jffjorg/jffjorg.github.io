And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to reopen discovery filed by the plaintiff, Deeanne Linsmaier, against the defendant, Wail Bushara. The motion is to serve Requests for Admission, Set 5, on the defendant regarding the issue of comparative negligence. The judge has denied the motion, stating that the reopening of discovery is a matter committed to the trial court's sound discretion and that the parties have sufficiently met and conferred on the matter. The judge has also noted that the motion is not a renewed request related to the September 13, 2023 order, as it concerns a new and distinct set of discovery responses specifically addressing the defendant's comparative fault defense raised in the motion for summary adjudication.
