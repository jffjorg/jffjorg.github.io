And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has ruled that the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of the City of Los Angeles' person most knowledgeable (PMK) on sidewalk issues is granted. The defendant's objection to the deposition was untimely and served electronically, rather than personally, as required by law. The court has also limited the scope of certain requests for production of documents related to the deposition. The defendant will be required to produce its PMK for deposition within 60 days of the order. The court has also ordered the defendant to pay sanctions in the amount of $600.
