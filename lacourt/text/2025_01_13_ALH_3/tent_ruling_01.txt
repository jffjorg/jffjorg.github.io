[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO CORRECT COMPLAINT

          On November
1, 2024, plaintiffs Lawanda Jackson and Kayzah Jackson (collectively,
“Plaintiffs”) filed this motion to amend the complaint and name the correct
defendant. On December 10, 2024, the Court continued the hearing so that
Plaintiffs could file a proposed Second Amended Complaint. 
          Plaintiffs’
counsel, Barry Zelner, describes the general confusion in identifying and
naming the correct defendant in this case. At first, Plaintiffs’ initial
complaint named only State Farm Insurance. On December 5, 2023, Plaintiffs
filed a First Amended Complaint naming State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance
(“State Farm Mutual”) and State Farm General Insurance Company (“State Farm
General”) and referred to them collectively as “State Farm.” State Farm General
was eventually dismissed because all parties mistakenly believed that the
correct defendant was State Farm Mutual. (Zelner Decl., ¶ 3.) However, it was later
determined that the correct defendant was in fact State Farm General, therefore
Plaintiffs filed a notice of errata and attempted to file an amended request to
dismiss State Farm Mutual. This “amended” request for dismissal was not
entered, but the parties continued to litigate with the understanding that State
Farm Mutual had been dismissed and that State Farm General was the correct
defendant. It was then discovered in August 2024 that State Farm General was no
longer a party. (Zelner Decl., Ex. 5.) 
This motion followed. 
The court may, in its discretion and
after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may be just, an
amendment to any pleading, including adding or striking out the name of any
party, or correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any
other respect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1).) “The court may deem a
motion to file an amendment to a pleading to be a motion to file an amended
pleading and require the filing of the entire previous pleading with the
approved amendments incorporated into it.” (CRC 3.1324, subd. (c).) 
The Court previously continued the
hearing so that Plaintiffs could file a proposed Second Amended Complaint that:
(1) included the name of the correct defendant (State Farm General) and (2) removed
State Farm Mutual as a defendant as well as “State Farm” as a collective
reference. An amended complaint was filed on December 13, 2024, but this
pleading did not remove the term “State Farm.” Therefore, the Court, on its own
motion, STRIKES this document from the docket. Instead, the Court GRANTS
Plaintiffs’ motion and orders Plaintiffs to file the proposed Second Amended
Complaint within 5 days of the date of this Order (i.e. delete the “proposed”
language from wherever it appears in the proposed Second Amended Complaint and
file the pleading properly). 
Moving party to give notice.
Dated
this 13th
day of January
