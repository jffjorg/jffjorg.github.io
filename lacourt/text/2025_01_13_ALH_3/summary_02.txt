And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Nitish Walia v. Nitish VisionQuest, LLC. Walia is seeking an order stating that his name was unlawfully used in the incorporation of VisionQuest, and that his personal identifying information was used without his consent. The judge has noted that no proof of service has been filed for the First Amended Petition, and that the law requires that due process be given to the person accused of unlawfully using the personally identifying information. The judge has therefore declined to rule on the petition at this time and has continued the hearing to allow Walia an opportunity to serve VisionQuest with the First Amended Petition. The judge has also noted that Walia may seek permission to serve VisionQuest through other means, such as service by publication or substituted service by hand delivery on the Secretary of State.
