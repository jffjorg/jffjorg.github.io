And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining a demurrer filed by the Cross-Defendant, Bella + Canvas LLC, against the Cross-Complainant, Tynan Leachman. The Cross-Complaint alleges fraud by Cross-Defendant, but the Judge finds that it lacks specific facts to support this claim. Specifically, the Cross-Complaint does not identify who made the alleged misrepresentations, their authority, or to whom the statements were made. The Judge also finds that Cross-Defendant was an employee entitled to payment of wages by the next payday, regardless of any agreements or representations made by the parties. As a result, the demurrer is sustained, and the Cross-Complaint is dismissed.
