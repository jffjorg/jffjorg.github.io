And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the motion of Cole R. Sheridan, counsel for plaintiff Christopher B. Maggiore, to be relieved as counsel. The client's communication and conduct have made it difficult for counsel to effectively represent the client, and the client has requested termination of representation but has not completed a substitution of counsel form. The judge notes that absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney's request for withdrawal should be granted, and that counsel's motion complies with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. The motion is granted, and counsel is relieved as of the date of filing a proof of service showing service of the order on the client and all parties who have appeared.
