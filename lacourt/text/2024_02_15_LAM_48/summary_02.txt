And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case, sustaining the demurrer filed by the defendants and dismissing the entire action. The plaintiff, Chiyuki Kawai, filed a complaint against the defendants, Netsu-Ken USA Inc., Mitsuyoshi Akita, and Mariko Akita, alleging breach of contract and fraud. The defendants filed a demurrer, arguing that the causes of action are time-barred and that the amended complaints omit important facts.

The judge has found that the causes of action are facially time-barred, as the statute of limitations for the 2015 Contract and the 2018 Contract has expired. The judge has also found that the amended complaints are incomplete and omit important facts about the 2015 Contract and the 2018 Contract.

As a result, the judge has sustained the demurrer and dismissed the entire action, including the allegations against Mariko Akita, who was not served with the summons and complaint. The judge has also ordered the plaintiff to give notice of the dismissal.
