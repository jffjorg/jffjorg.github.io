And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has sustained Pilot Travel Centers LLC's demurrer to the complaint, dismissing the defendant from the action. The demurrer argued that Pilot is not liable for third parties' unforeseeable criminal conduct. The judge found that the plaintiffs had failed to allege prior similar criminal incidents or other indications of a reasonably foreseeable risk of violent criminal assaults on Pilot's premises. The judge noted that the plaintiffs' allegations of thefts and assaults in the area did not allege prior similar incidents of violent crime on Pilot's premises. The judge also found that the plaintiffs had failed to cure the deficiencies in their complaint despite several prior opportunities to amend.
