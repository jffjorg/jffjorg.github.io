  CASE NO.: 22STCV18081
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO BE RELIEVED
  AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
February 15, 2024



 
Cole
R. Sheridan, counsel of record for Plaintiff Christopher B. Maggiore, seeks to be
relieved as counsel.  Counsel’s declaration
states that the client’s communication and conduct have rendered it unreasonably
difficult for counsel to carry out the presentation effectively.  The client has also requested termination of the
representation but has not completed a substitution of counsel form.  No party opposed the motions.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motion
complies with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  There is no pending trial date, and there is no
prejudice to Plaintiff.
The
unopposed motion to be relieved is GRANTED and effective upon filing a proof of
service showing service of the signed Form MC-053 order and this order on Christopher
B. Maggiore and all parties who have appeared.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
 
        
Dated this 15th day of February 2024
