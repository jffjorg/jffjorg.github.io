[TENTATIVE] ORDER SUSTAINING DEMURRER
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
February 15, 2024



 
On
August 21, 2023, Tynan Leachman filed a first amended complaint against Bella +
Canvas LLC, alleging waiting time penalties and failure to provide employment records.
On
September 25, 2023, Bella + Canvas LLC (“Cross-Complainant”) filed a cross-complaint
against Tynan Leachman (“Cross-Defendant”), alleging fraud.
On
November 13, 2023, Cross-Defendant filed a demurrer.
A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740,
747.)  When considering demurrers, courts
read the allegations liberally and in context, accepting the alleged facts as true.  (Nolte v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (2015)
236 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1406.)
The
cross-complaint’s sole cause of action is for fraud.  The cross-complaint alleges that Cross-Defendant,
through his agency, misrepresented that Cross-Complainant should pay the agency
for Cross-Defendant’s modeling services upon receipt of an invoice instead of paying
Cross-Defendant directly.  (Cross-Complaint
¶¶ 9-10, 18.)  Cross-Defendant reasonably
relied on this representation “because it was instructed to do so by someone with
authority and the instruction comported with standard industry practice.”  (Cross-Complaint ¶ 20.)  At the September 6, 2022 photoshoot, Cross-Defendant
intentionally failed to disclose that he intended to make a claim against Cross-Complainant
unless it paid him directly shortly after the photo shoot, prior to receipt of an
invoice.  (Cross-Complaint ¶ 21.)  Cross-Complainant waited to receive the November
16, 2022 invoice from the agency and then paid the agency directly, rather than
paying Cross-Defendant directly, which led to Cross-Defendant’s action for waiting
time penalties.  (Cross-Complaint ¶¶ 12, 15,
24.)
A.        The Cross-Complaint Does Not Allege Specific
Facts for Fraud.
Cross-Defendant
argues that the cross-complaint does not plead specific facts.  (Demurrer at p. 3.)
“The
essential elements of a count for intentional misrepresentation are (1) a misrepresentation,
(2) knowledge of falsity, (3) intent to induce reliance, (4) actual and justifiable
reliance, and (5) resulting damage.”  (Chapman
v. Skype Inc. (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 217, 230-231.)  Fraud must be pleaded with specificity.  (Small v. Fritz Companies, Inc. (2003)
30 Cal.4th 167, 184.)  “‘This particularity
requirement necessitates pleading facts which show how, when, where, to whom,
and by what means the representations were tendered.’  [Citation.] 
A plaintiff’s burden in asserting a fraud claim against a corporate employer
is even greater.  In such a case, the plaintiff
must ‘allege the names of the persons who made the allegedly fraudulent representations,
their authority to speak, to whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when
it was said or written.’  [Citation.]”  (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th
631, 645 (Lazar).)
Fraud
based on concealment requires that “(1) the defendant must have concealed or suppressed
a material fact, (2) the defendant must have been under a duty to disclose the fact
to the plaintiff, (3) the defendant must have intentionally concealed or suppressed
the fact with the intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have been
unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he did if he had known of the concealed
or suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of the concealment or suppression of the
fact, the plaintiff must have sustained damage.”  (Bigler-Engler v. Breg, Inc. (2017) 7 Cal.App.5th
276, 310-311.)
The
cross-complaint alleges that on August 29, 2022, it and Two Management agreed to
a contract with specific terms, including timing and method of payment for Cross-Defendant’s
services.  (Cross-Complaint ¶ 9.)  However, there are no facts about who at the agency
made the representations, their authority, or to whom at Cross-Complainant the statements
were made.  (See Lazar, supra, 12 Cal.4th
at p. 645.)  There is also no allegation that
Cross-Defendant had a duty to disclose information about payment, as required for
fraudulent concealment.
Because
the cross-complaint lacks the required specific facts to allege fraud, the demurrer
is sustained.
B.        Cross-Complainant Cannot Allege Fraud
as a Matter of Law.
Cross-Defendant
also argues that the cross-complaint fails as a matter of law.  (Demurrer at pp. 3-4.)
Cross-Complainant
argues that that the issue of whether Cross-Defendant was an “employee” requires
a fact-intensive inquiry.  (Opposition at
p. 6.)  However, under the Labor Code, a “print
shoot employee” is “an individual hired for a period of limited duration to render
services relating to or supporting a still image shoot, including film or digital
photography, for use in print, digital, or internet media.”  (Lab. Code, § 201.6, subd. (a)(1).)  “A print shoot employee is entitled to receive
payment of the wages earned and unpaid at the time of termination by the next regular
payday.”  (Lab. Code, § 201.6, subd. (b).)  As a matter of law, Cross-Defendant was an employee
entitled to payment of wages by the next payday.
As
Cross-Defendant notes (Demurrer at pp. 3-4), the timely payment of wages cannot
be waived by agreement.  (Lab. Code, § 219,
subd. (a) [“no provision of this article can in any way be contravened or set aside
by a private agreement, whether written, oral, or implied”; see also Lab. Code,
§ 432.6, subd. (a) [an employer cannot require an employee to waive any rights under
the Labor Code].)  Thus, regardless of what
Cross-Defendant or the agency represented, or what the industry custom and practice
was, Cross-Complainant could not reasonably rely on those representations for the
timing of paying wages.  (See Robinson
v. Fair Employment & Housing Com. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 226, 244 [“ employers
are presumed to know the law and whether they come within the statutory definition
of ‘employer’”].)
Cross-Complainant
also alleges that “[t]he Court of Appeal[] has explicitly held that a model’s failure
to disclose payment expectations that differ from agreed contract terms is a material
non-disclosure that satisfies the misrepresentation element of fraud.”  (Opposition at p. 5.)  Cross-Complainant’s cited case does not support
this claim.  In Brighton Collectibles, LLC
v. Hockey (2021) 65 Cal.App.5th 99, 104, the Court of Appeal found
that employer showed the requisite minimal merit for a similar fraud claim to survive
an anti-SLAPP motion.  The court did not discuss
any implications of the Labor Code, and “cases are not authority for propositions
not considered.”  (B.B. v. County of Los
Angeles (2020) 10 Cal.5th 1, 11, quotation marks omitted.)
The
demurrer is sustained.
C.        Conclusion
The
demurrer is SUSTAINED.  Cross-Complainant
has not shown how it can cure the deficiencies, so no leave to amend is granted.
The
cross-complaint filed on September 25, 2023 is DISMISSED.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
