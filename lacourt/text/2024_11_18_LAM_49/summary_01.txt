And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the applications of Jennifer A. Riley and Gerald L. Maatman, Jr. to appear as counsel pro hac vice in a PAGA action brought by Corey J. Devine against Capstone Logistics, LLC. The applications were filed by the defendant, and no opposition was filed. The judge has denied the applications unless the counsel can demonstrate "special circumstances" at the hearing justifying their "repeat appearances" in California. The judge is concerned about the number of times the counsel has appeared pro hac vice in California courts in the past two years, and has ordered the counsel to provide more information about the matters in which they previously appeared. The judge has also noted that it is unclear why the counsel need to be involved in the case at this time, as the defendant's law firm, Duane Morris, has sufficient lawyers licensed in California to adequately represent it.
