And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Defendant Aleksey Pak. The court sustains the demurrer to the First, Second, and Third Causes of Action, which are allegations of libel, libel per se, and false light. The court finds that the allegations are insufficient to state a cause of action because they do not specify the exact words of the allegedly defamatory statement made by Defendant Pak on Yelp. The court gives Plaintiffs 30 days leave to amend the First Cause of Action only. The court also sustains the demurrer to the Second and Third Causes of Action, which are duplicative of the First Cause of Action. The motion to strike is moot because the demurrer is sustained in its entirety.
