CLPF Crescent Park
v. Shelby Emerald, Case No. 23SMCV04382
Hearing Date
December 13, 2023 
Defendant Emerald’s
Demurrer to Crescent Park’s Complaint 
 
On August 3, 2023 defendant
Emerald sued her landlord CLPF Crescent Park, alleging habitability violations
and retaliation, case no. 23SMCV03577. On August 19, 2023 CLPF filed this case,
an unlawful detainer claim, alleging nonpayment of rent. Emerald demurs,
arguing the two actions involve “the same parties on the same cause of action.”

 
Per Cal. Code of
Civ. Proc. §430.10(c), a complaint is subject to demurrer if “[t]here is
another action pending between the same parties on the same cause of action.” 
 
Emerald argues §430.10(c)
applies, since her lawsuit against CLPF precedes the unlawful detainer claim,
involves the same parties and arises out of the same tenancy. The two lawsuits
involve different causes of action and are based on different alleged breaches.
Section 430.10(c) exists to prevent the filing of successive identical
lawsuits. 
 
Although these cases
involve the same parties, the claims are different. Emerald alleges CLPF violated
duties it owed her as a landlord; CLPF alleges Emerald did not pay her rent. These
are distinct claims, not a proper basis for demurrer. OVERRULED. Defendant to
answer within 5 days.
