The fees and costs are related to Palm Finance's appeal of the summary judgment granted in their favor in January 2022. The appeal was affirmed by the Court of Appeal in September 2023, and Palm Finance is seeking reimbursement for the reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred during the appeal process. Since there is no opposition to the motion, the court has granted the motion and awarded Palm Finance the requested fees and costs.
