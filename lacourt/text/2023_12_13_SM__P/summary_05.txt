```

And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in favor of CLPF Crescent Park, denying Shelby Emerald's demurrer to CLPF's complaint. Emerald had argued that the two lawsuits, one for habitability violations and retaliation, and the other for nonpayment of rent, involve the same cause of action and are therefore subject to demurrer. However, the judge finds that the claims are distinct and not a proper basis for demurrer. The judge rules that the unlawful detainer claim is valid and orders Emerald to answer within 5 days.
