Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion for summary adjudication in the case of Barboza, et al. v. Holiday Villa East Management, LP, et al. The motion was filed in response to the plaintiffs' claims of retaliatory termination, hostile work environment, lack of meal and rest breaks, off-the-clock work without pay, and failure to reimburse.

The judge has denied the motion for summary adjudication on several claims, including wrongful termination, failure to pay all earned wages/overtime, and failure to furnish accurate wage and hour statements. The judge has also granted the motion on two claims, failure to indemnify Barboza and Rhonda Madrid, finding that the evidence presented did not create a triable issue of fact.

The judge has also addressed the admissibility of evidence, including declarations, time sheets, and emails. The judge has found that the time sheets are admissible as business records, but that the emails are ambiguous and require clarification. The judge has also found that the declarations of the parties' witnesses are admissible, but that the declarations of Barboza and Madrid do not create a triable issue of fact.

The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change based on further briefing and argument by the parties. The case is set for further hearing on December 13, 2023.
