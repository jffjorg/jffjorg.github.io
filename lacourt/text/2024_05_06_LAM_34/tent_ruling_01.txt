BACKGROUND:
 
        On April 8, 2022, Chavez General Construction,
Inc. (“Chavez”) filed its Verified Complaint against David Moezinia
(“Moezinia”) on causes of action of breach of contract, common counts, and
mechanic’s lien foreclosure. 
 
        On May 20, 2022, Chavez filed its
Amendment to Complaint. 
 
        On June 23, 2022, Moezinia filed: (1)
Verified Answer to the Complaint; and (2) Verified Cross-Complaint (“Moezinia
Cross-Complaint”) against Chavez, Salvador Chavez Gonzalez, and Hudson
Insurance Company (“Hudson”). 
 
        On July 8, 2022, Chavez refiled its
Amendment to Complaint. 
 
        On July 26, 2022, Hudson filed: (1)
Answer to the Moezinia Cross-Complaint; and (2) Cross-Complaint (“Hudson
Cross-Complaint”) against Chavez General Construction, Inc. and David Moezinia.

 
        On September 20, 2022, Chavez and
Salvador Chavez Gonzalez filed their Verified Answer to the Moezinia
Cross-Complaint. 
 
        On August 9, 2023, by request of Hudson,
the Clerk’s Office dismissed without prejudice the Hudson Cross-Complaint. 
 
        On November 28, 2023, the Court granted
summary judgment in favor of Hudson and against Moezinia on the fourth cause of
action for recovery on contractor’s license bond in the Moezinia
Cross-Complaint. 
 
        On March 11, 2024, by request of
Moezinia, the Clerk’s Office dismissed without prejudice Salvador Chavez
Gonzalez from the Moezinia Cross-Complaint. 
 
        On March 25, 2024, the Court held a
bench trial in this matter. There was no appearance by or for Chavez at trial.
After receiving evidence, the Court ordered Moezinia dismissed with prejudice
from the Complaint. The Court found that Chavez was not a licensed contractor
at the time of construction. 
 
        On April 3, 2024, the Court entered
Judgment in this matter in favor of Moezinia and against Chavez in the total
amount of $48,149.00. The Court allowed the prevailing party, Moezinia, to
recover costs and fees upon motion. The Court also ordered the mechanic’s lien
filed by Chavez released. 
 
        On April 4, 2024, Moezinia filed his
Motion for Attorney’s Fees. Moezinia concurrently filed Judicial Council Form
EFS-020, Proposed Order (Cover Sheet). 
 
        On April 17, 2024, Moezinia filed
Judicial Council Form MC-010, Memorandum of Costs (Summary). 
 
        On April 25, 2024, Moezinia filed Notice
of Settlement of Disputed Claim Between Hudson Insurance Company and David
Moezinia. 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal Standard
 
“Except as otherwise expressly
provided by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to
recover costs in any action or proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd.
(b).)
 
Attorneys’ fees are allowed as costs
when authorized by contract, statute, or law. (Code Civ. Proc, § 1033.5, subd.
(a)(10)(B).)
 
II.      
Discussion
 
A.      The
Parties’ Arguments
 
Moezinia moves the Court to award:
 
(1)       $52,120.00 in fees
against Chavez;
 
(2)       $1,694.40 in costs
against Chavez;
 
(3)       $39,320.00 in costs
against Hudson; and
 
(4)       $1,405.01 in costs
against Hudson. 
 
(Motion for Attorney’s Fees, p. 12:3–7.)
 
        Moezinia argues that he is
entitled to these fees and costs pursuant to: (1) the contract; and (2) Code of
Civil Procedure 1029.8. (Motion for Attorney’s Fees, pp. 8:3–4, 8:26, 9:1–23.) 
 
        Moezinia further argues that
the full amount of fees claimed is reasonable and should be awarded. (Motion
for Attorney’s Fees, p. 8:17–18.)
 
        Neither Chavez nor Hudson
opposed the Motion for Attorney’s Fees. Rather, Hudson appears to have made a
settlement with Moezinia, such that “Hudson has agreed to pay Moezinia the sum
of $25,000.00 and agrees to waive collection of its cost bill filed after it[s]
Motion for Summary Judgment was granted in November 2023. . .  At the Request of Moezinia, the payment of
$25,000.00 shall be credited towards any sums approved by the Court on May 6,
2024 against [Chavez].” (Notice of Settlement of Disputed Claim Between Hudson
Insurance Company and David Moezinia, p. 2:6–15, capitalization omitted.)
 
B.      Authority
for Fees & Prevailing Party
 
1.      Legal
Standard
 
“In any action on a contract, where the
contract specifically provides that attorney’s fees and costs, which are
incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the
parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be the
party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she is the party specified in
the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees in
addition to other costs. Where a contract provides for attorney’s fees, as set
forth above, that provision shall be construed as applying to the entire
contract, unless each party was represented by counsel in the negotiation and
execution of the contract, and the fact of that representation is specified in
the contract. Reasonable attorney’s fees shall be fixed by the court, and shall
be an element of the costs of suit. Attorney’s fees provided for by this
section shall not be subject to waiver by the parties to any contract which is
entered into after the effective date of this section. Any provision in any
such contract which provides for a waiver of attorney’s fees is void.” (Civ.
Code, § 1717, subd. (a), paragraph breaks omitted.)
 
“Any unlicensed
person who causes injury or damage to another person as a result of providing
goods or performing services for which a license is required under Division 2
(commencing with Section 500) or any initiative act referred to therein,
Division 3 (commencing with Section 5000), or Chapter 2 (commencing with
Section 18600) or Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 19000) of Division 8, of
the Business and Professions Code, or Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 25210)
or Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 25230) of Part 3 of Division 1 of Title 4
of the Corporations Code, shall be liable to the injured person for treble the
amount of damages assessed in a civil action in any court having proper
jurisdiction. The court may, in its discretion, award all costs and attorney’s
fees to the injured person if that person prevails in the action.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1029.8, subd. (a).)
 
“This section
shall not be construed to confer an additional cause of action or to affect or
limit any other remedy, including, but not limited to, a claim for exemplary
damages.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1029.8, subd. (b).)
 
2. 
    Discussion
 
The contract at issue here states: “The prevailing party shall be
entitled to recover its attorneys’ fees.” (Motion for Attorney’s Fees, Exh. 1,
p. 7 [actual p. 20 of 41].) Thus, Civil Code section 1717 applies here. 
 
Furthermore, as discussed in the Court’s order regarding Hudson’s
Motion for Summary Judgment, Code of Civil Procedure section 1029.8 applies
here as well. 
 
The Parties do not dispute, and the Court finds, that: (a) Moezinia is
the prevailing party; and (b) that Moezinia is entitled to attorney’s fees as
the prevailing party against both Chavez and Hudson.
 
C. 
    Method
of Calculation for Fees
 
The Parties do not make arguments about which method the Court should
use to calculate attorney’s fees. 
 
The Court uses
the lodestar adjustment method.
 
D. 
    Reasonableness
of the Fees Claimed
 
1. 
    Legal
Standard
 
“Under the lodestar adjustment
methodology, the trial court must initially determine the actual time expended
and then ascertain whether under all the circumstances¿of the case the amount
of actual time expended and
the monetary charge being made for the time expended are reasonable. Factors to
be considered include, but are not limited to, the complexity of the case and
procedural demands, the attorney skill exhibited and the results achieved. The
prevailing party and fee applicant bears the burden of showing that the fees
incurred were reasonably necessary to¿the conduct of the litigation, and were reasonable in amount. It
follows that if the prevailing party fails to meet this burden, and the court
finds the time expended or amount charged is not reasonable under the
circumstances, then the court must take this into account and award attorney
fees in a lesser amount.” (Mikhaeilpoor v. BMW of N. Am., LLC (2020) 48
Cal.App.5th 240, 247 [cleaned up].)
 
2. 
    Reasonableness
of the Hourly Rates
 
Moezinia’s attorneys — Steven S. Loeb, Alan L. Rosen, and Diane Goldman
– each have over forty-five years of legal experience.  They each claim that they charge $400.00 per
hour. (Motion for Attorney’s Fees, Decl. Loeb, ¶¶ 11–13.)
 
The Court finds that these rates are reasonable. 
 
3. 
    Reasonableness
of the Number of Hours
 
Moezinia’s Counsel claim that 129.3 billable hours were incurred on
this matter (as well as 5.2 non-billable hours incurred), with one additional
billable hour occurring to appear for the Motion for Attorney’s Fees. (Motion
for Attorney’s Fees, Decl. Loeb, ¶¶ 13–14 and Exh. 2, p. 11.) 
 
The Court finds that 130.3 hours is a reasonable amount of time to have
spent on this matter. This is because there were multiple parties, multiples
pleadings, and multiple motions — including a discovery motion and two motions
for summary judgment.  The Court itself
has 47 pages of notes related to this case. 
 
The Court notes, however, that 130.3 hours multiplied by $400.00 per
hour is only $52,120.00. No additional hours are claimed to have been spent
solely on Hudson, even though Moezinia’s motion could be read as requesting
additional fees for Hudson. The Court shall permit recovery of the 130.3 in
billable hours actually incurred; the Court shall not permit any double
recovery in fees. 
 
E.      Reasonableness
of the Costs Claimed
 
Moezinia claims $1,694.40 in costs. The Court
has reviewed these costs and finds them to be reasonable. 
 
As with fees, the Court notes that $1,694.40
appears to be the total amount of costs incurred. No additional costs are
claimed to have been spent solely on Hudson. The Court shall only permit
recovery of the $1,694.40 in costs actually incurred; the Court shall not
permit a double recovery in costs.  
 
III.    
Conclusion
 
The Motion for Attorney’s Fees is GRANTED in
part. Attorneys’ fees and costs are AWARDED in favor of Moezinia and against
Chavez and Hudson. Chavez shall be responsible for the total $53,814.40 in fees
and costs. Pursuant to the settlement between Moezinia and Hudson, Hudson shall
be jointly and severally liable with Chavez for only $25,000.00 of that amount.
