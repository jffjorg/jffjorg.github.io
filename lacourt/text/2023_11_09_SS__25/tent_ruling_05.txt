ESTEFANI ASTORGA URIBE Case No.:                                23STLC04681 Motion:                                   1. Petition to Confirm Minor’s Compromise as to Minor  Claimant: La’Riah Porter Williams Moving Party:                         Petitioner Laneisha Porter    Responding Party:                   None  Notice:                                    OK    Tentative Ruling:           The Petition  to Confirm Minor’s Compromise as to Minor Claimant: La’Riah Porter William, age  12, is  CONTINUED  (date to be discussed at hearing).  Petitioner is to address and  resolve deficiencies.     BACKGROUND    This  action arises from a motor vehicle accident that occurred on January 12,  2023.  On July 25, 2023, Plaintiff  La’Riah Porter Williams, a minor by and through her guardian ad litem, Laneisha  Porter, filed a complaint against Defendant Estefani Astorge Uribe and Does  1-10, asserting a cause of action for negligence.  Plaintiff alleges that Defendant collided  into the vehicle which Plaintiff was a rear passenger causing her injuries.     Laneisha  Porter was appointed minor Claimant’s guardian ad litem on August 10, 2023.  (8-10-23 Application and Order for Appointment of Guardian Ad Litem.)    On  August 18, 2023, Petitioner filed the instant Petition to Confirm Minor’s  Compromise as to Minor Claimant: La’Riah Porter William, age 12.    On  August 18, 2023, Petitioner filed the Order Approving Compromise and Order to  Deposit Money into Blocked Account.   ANALYSIS    I.          Legal Standard   Court approval is required for  all settlements of a minor’s claim.   (Prob. Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; CCP § 372.)  “‘[W]ithout trial court approval of the proposed compromise of the  ward’s claim, the settlement cannot be valid. [Citation.] [¶] Nor is the  settlement binding [on the minor] until it is endorsed by the trial  court.’”  (Pearson v. Superior Court  (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338.)  A  minor, like Claimant, “shall appear either by a guardian or conservator of the  estate or by a guardian ad litem appointed by the court in which the action or  proceeding is pending, or by a judge thereof, in each case.” (Code Civ. Proc.,  § 372, subd. (a)(1).)  Alternatively, the  petitioner may file a declaration demonstrating that he or she has a right to  compromise the minor’s claim under Cal. Probate Code section 3500.     Regarding the substance of the  Petition, to obtain court approval of the settlement of a minor’s claims, the  petitioner must file a complete and “verified petition for approval of  the settlement and must disclose ‘all information that has any bearing upon the  reasonableness of the compromise.’ [Citations.]”  (Barnes v. Western Heritage Ins. Co. (2013)  217 Cal.App.4th 249, 256; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)  (Italics added.)       II.        Discussion     The Court has reviewed the ¿Petition to Confirm Minor’s Compromise  as to Minor Claimant: La’Riah Porter William, age 12¿.    The Court finds that the $9,517 settlement is reasonable.  Also, the  Court has considered the Declaration of Kaline Lam in support of the requested  attorneys’ fees and costs.  The Court  finds that on the current record, and in consideration of the factors set forth  in Cal Rules of Court, Rule 7.955(b), a fee of 25% of the gross settlement is  reasonable.     However, the Court cannot grant the  petition at this time due to defects with the petition including:    (1)    Because Petitioner is  also minor Claimant’s guardian ad litem, the guardian ad litem box in item 1  should be checked.  (2)    Item 10(c) should be  completed. (3)    Item 12(a) should be  completed.  (4)    Item 12(b)(5)(a)(ii)  should state the amount of statutory lien.  (5)   Item 12(b)(5)(b)(i)  provides that $4245 was charged with a $1995.15 negotiated reduction, but lists  $1995.15 as the amount to be paid from settlement (rather than $2249.85 after  the reduction). (6)   Item  12(b)(5)(b)(ii) provides that $2605 was charged with a $1224.35 negotiated  reduction, but lists $1224.35 as the amount to be paid from settlement (rather  than $1380.65 after the reduction). (7)    The  reduction agreements should be included as Attachment 12b(5) to the Petition.       III.       Conclusion     The ¿Petition  to Confirm Minor’s Compromise as to Minor Claimant: La’Riah Porter William, age  12¿, is  CONTINUED (to a date to be discussed at hearing).  Petitioner is to address and  resolve deficiencies. Counsel for Petitioner is directed to give notice.
