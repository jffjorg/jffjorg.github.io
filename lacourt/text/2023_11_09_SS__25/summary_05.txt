And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Petition to Confirm Minor's Compromise as to Minor Claimant La'Riah Porter Williams, age 12, is continued to a date to be discussed at the hearing. The petitioner, Laneisha Porter, must address and resolve deficiencies in the petition, including checking the guardian ad litem box, completing certain items, and including reduction agreements as an attachment. The court has reviewed the petition and finds that the $9,517 settlement is reasonable, and a fee of 25% of the gross settlement is also reasonable. However, the petition cannot be granted at this time due to the deficiencies.
