ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On May 18, 2023, Plaintiff Westlake Services, LLC (“Plaintiff”)
filed an action against Defendant Todd Huffman (“Defendant”). 
 
Defendant filed the instant Demurrer to Plaintiff’s
Complaint (the “Demurrer”) on September 5, 2023. Plaintiff filed an opposition
on October 12, 2023. On November 2, 2023, Defendant filed a reply. 
 
II.                
Legal
Standard
 
“The primary function of a pleading is
to give the other party notice so that it may prepare its
case [citation], and a defect in a pleading that
otherwise properly notifies a party cannot be said to
affect substantial rights.” (Harris v. City of Santa Monica (2013) 56 Cal.4th 203, 240.)
“A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the
factual allegations in a complaint.” (Ivanoff
v. Bank of
America, N.A. (2017) 9 Cal.App.5th 719, 725.) The
Court looks to whether “the complaint alleges
facts sufficient to state a cause of action or discloses
a complete defense.” (Id.) The Court
does not
“read passages from a complaint in isolation; in
reviewing a ruling on a demurrer, we read the
complaint ‘as a whole and its parts in their context.’
[Citation.]” (West v. JPMorgan Chase
Bank,
N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 780, 804.) The
Court “assume[s] the truth of the properly pleaded
factual allegations, facts that reasonably can be
inferred from those expressly pleaded and matters of
which judicial notice has been taken.” (Harris,
supra, 56 Cal.4th p. 240.) “The court does not,
however, assume the truth of contentions, deductions or
conclusions of law. [Citation.]” (Durell
v.
Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.) Where written documents are the foundation of an action and
are attached to the complaint and incorporated therein by reference, they
become a part of the complaint and may be considered on demurrer. (Byrne v. Harvey (1962) 211
Cal.App.2d 92, 103; see also Dodd v. Citizens Bank of Costa
Mesa (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1624,
1626–1627.)
 
            A
general demurrer may be brought under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10,
subdivision (e) if insufficient facts are stated to support the cause of action
asserted or under section 430.10, subdivision (a), where the court has no
jurisdiction of the subject of the cause of action alleged in the pleading. All
other grounds listed in Section 430.10, including uncertainty under subdivision
(f), are special demurrers. Special demurrers are not allowed in limited
jurisdiction courts. (Code Civ. Proc., § 92, subd. (c).)
 
            Leave to
amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976)
18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)  The burden is on
the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully.
(Id.) 
 
            Finally,
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41 requires that “[b]efore filing a
demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in
person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to
demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached
that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).) The parties are to meet and confer at least five
days before the date the responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41, subd. (a)(2).) Thereafter, the demurring party shall file and serve a
declaration detailing their meet and confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41, subd. (a)(3).) 
 
III.             
Discussion

 
The Demurrer is accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision
(a).
 
Defendant demurs on the basis that the Complaint fails to
state sufficient facts. (Notice of Dem., p. 2.) Defendant asserts that as
to the first cause of action for breach of contract, Defendant has failed to
allege independently which provision, if any, of the purported contract between
the parties was breached. (Ibid.) Defendant also asserts that as to the
second cause of action for breach of warranty, Defendant has similarly failed
to allege independently which warranty was breached. (Ibid.) 
 
To state a cause of action for breach of contract,
Plaintiff must be able to establish “(1) the existence of the contract, (2)
plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach,
and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff.” (Oasis West Realty, LLC v.
Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th 811, 821.) 
 
If a breach of contract claim “is based on alleged breach
of a written contract, the terms must be set out verbatim in the body of the
complaint or a copy of the written agreement must be attached and incorporated
by reference.” (Harris v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999) 74
Cal.App.4th 299, 307.) In some circumstances, a plaintiff may also “plead the
legal effect of the contract rather than its precise language.” (Construction
Protective Services, Inc. v. TIG Specialty Ins. Co. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 189,
198-199.) 
 
            Defendant argues the complaint fails
to allege any facts to establish breach of contract against him.  However, Plaintiff alleges the existence of
an enforceable agreement between Plaintiff and Defendant Todd Huffman executed
on October 28, 2009.  (Complaint, First
Cause of Action PDF pg. 3/12, para. BC-1.) 

 
            Plaintiff attaches copies of two
agreements executed on October 28, 2009: 
a Master Dealer Agreement and a Personal Guaranty.  (Complaint, PDF pg. 5/12, “Master Dealer Agreement”;
Harris, supra, 74 Cal.App.4th at 307.) 
The Master Dealer Agreement includes a “Confirmation and Execution of
Master Dealer Agreement” signed Defendant Huffman as the “owner” of The Auto
Gallery LLC.  (Complaint, PDF pg. 11/12,
“Master Dealer Agreement.”)  The Personal
Guaranty is signed by Defendant Huffman in his individual capacity and “guarantees
the prompt full payment and performance of all obligations arising out of” the
Master Dealer Agreement signed by The Auto Gallery LLC.  (Complaint, PDF pg. 12/12, “Personal
Guaranty.”)  Plaintiff therefore alleges Huffman’s
personal obligation pursuant to the Personal Guaranty to make The Auto Gallery
LLC’s payments due under the Master Dealer Agreement.
 
            Plaintiff alleges its full
performance of all obligations except those obligations Plaintiff was prevented
or excused from performing.  (Complaint,
First Cause of Action PDF pg. 3/12, para. BC-3.)  Plaintiff alleges Defendant Huffman’s breach
on July 21, 2021: “Defendant did not make payments as required pursuant to the
terms of the contract.”  (Complaint,
First Cause of Action PDF pg. 3/12, para. BC-2.)  Plaintiff also alleges damages flowing from
the breach in the amount of $22,062.02. 
(Complaint, First Cause of Action PDF pg. 3/12, para. BC-4.)  
 
Accordingly, the Demurrer is OVERRULED. 
 
IV.

For the foregoing reasons, Defendant
Todd Huffman’s Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint is OVERRULED.  Defendant is ordered to file an answer within
twenty (20) days of this hearing date.
