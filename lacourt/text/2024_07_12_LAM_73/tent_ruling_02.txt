DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO STRIKE PORTIONS OF
PLAINTIFF’S complaint (filed 02/08/24)
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendant’s motion to strike portions
of the Complaint is GRANTED.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On December 4, 2023, Plaintiffs J.K. Residential Services
Inc. (“JKRSI”) and Ruben Aghrazaryn filed this action against Defendant Nextech Engineering, Inc. 
 
Plaintiffs
allege a cause of action for malicious prosecution. 
 
The
Complaint alleges the following. The
owners of several apartment buildings, acting through their agents, Plaintiffs JKRSI and
Aghrazaryn, entered into a service agreement with Defendant in which Defendant
was to provide engineering services for an earthquake retrofit of
apartment buildings’ parking facilities. Plaintiffs allege that Defendant maliciously,
without probable cause, and for the purpose of harassing and annoying
Plaintiffs, filed two
cross-actions against Plaintiffs which were both terminated in Plaintiffs’
favor. On April 4, 2019, Defendant maliciously filed and
maintained a counterclaim (“Malicious Prosecution Case No. 1”) against Plaintiffs
as part of its Answer in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County action
entitled 14600 Saticoy Street LLC, et al. v. Nextech Engineering, Case
no. 19STCV06985. In Defendant’s Malicious Prosecution Case No. 1, Defendant amended
its cross-complaint to assert claims for breach of oral agreement, breach of
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, work, labor, materials, and
services rendered and payment due, and for false promises against Plaintiffs. On
April 28, 2020, Defendant maliciously filed and maintained a counterclaim
(“Malicious Prosecution Case No. 2”) against Plaintiffs as part of its Answer
in the Los Angeles County Superior Court action titled 15025 Saticoy Street
Inc., et al. v. Nextech Engineering, Inc., Case No. 20STCV09793.
Defendant’s Malicious Prosecution Case No. 2 asserted claims for breach of oral
agreement, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, work,
labor, materials, and services rendered, and payment due, and false promises,
and sought the recovery of damages against Plaintiff. On April 30, 2021,
Malicious Prosecution Case No. 2 was dismissed with prejudice on demurrer. On
December 13, 2021, Malicious Prosecution Case No. 1 came on for trial and
judgment was entered for Plaintiffs. 
 
On February 8, 2024, Defendant filed a motion to strike portions of Plaintiffs’
Complaint.
·       Defendant moves to strikes portions of the Complaint where Plaintiffs
reference and base their claims relating to the Malicious Prosecution Case No.
2.
·       Defendant argues Malicious Prosecution Case No. 2 falls under the Statue of Limitations for a malicious prosecution
action.
·       Under
California law, malicious prosecution claims have a two- year statue of
limitations. (West's Ann. Cal. C.C.P, § 335.1.)
·       Plaintiffs
state in the Complaint, the Malicious
Prosecution Case No. 2 was dismissed with prejudice on April 30, 2021,
more than two (2) years prior to Plaintiffs’ filing of the instant action.
 
In opposition to the motion to strike, Plaintiffs argue:
·       Plaintiffs’
cause of action for malicious prosecution arising from LASC Case No.
20STCV09793 was tolled pursuant to Emergency Rule No. 9, enacted by the
California Judicial Council under authority by Governor Newsom, in his
Executive Order N-38-20, which arose from the Covid-19 pandemic. Said Order was
signed and went into effect on March 20, 2020.
·       Therefore,
the statute of limitations period for Malicious Prosecution Action No. 2, which
ordinarily would have expired in April 2023, was tolled until ninety (90) days
after Executive Order N-38-20 was rescinded, which would have been
approximately September 30, 2022. Plaintiffs’ lawsuit was filed on December 4,
2023, well within the statue of limitations taking into account the tolling
period brought about by the Covid-19 Pandemic shutdown
 
In reply, Defendant argues:
·       The Tolling Period of Statute of Limitation ended on October 1, 2020 by
the Amendment of the Judicial Council on May 29, 2020, and therefore,
Plaintiffs’ Malicious Prosecution Case No. 2 is clearly outside the 2-year
Statute of Limitations.
 
II. DISCUSSION 
 
A.     Legal
Standard for Motion to Strike
 
The court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its
discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or
improper matter inserted in any pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., (CCP) § 436(a).) The court may also strike all or any part of any
pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court
rule, or an order of the court. (Id., § 436(b).) The grounds for moving to strike must appear on the
face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice. (Id.¿§¿437.)¿
¿ 
B.     Meet and
Confer Requirement 
 
Prior to filing a motion to strike, the moving party is
required to satisfy their meet and confer obligations and demonstrate that they
so satisfied their meet and confer obligation by submitting a declaration. (CCP
§ 435.5.) 
 
Here, counsel for Defendant submitted a declaration stating they sent Plaintiff’s
counsel a correspondence outlining the issues raised in the motion to strike and
invited him to a telephonic meet and confer discussion. (Kim Decl., ¶ 3.) Defendant’s counsel states the Plaintiff’s counsel did
not respond or call during the times Defendant’s counsel offered to discuss. (Ibid.) Although
the parties did not meet and confer in-person or by telephone as required by CPP § 435.5, the Court finds the moving party’s attempt has
satisfied their meet and confer obligations.
 
C.    
Request for
Judicial Notice
 
Defendant
requests judicial notice of Defendant’s
cross-action (Cross-Complaint) against Plaintiffs in the civil case titled
‘15025 Saticoy Street, Inc. v. Nextech Engineering, Inc., Case No. 20STCV09793.
 
The Court may take judicial notice of official legislative, executive,
and judicial acts. (Evid. Code § 452(c).) The Court may also take judicial
notice of “[f]acts and propositions that are not reasonably subject to dispute
and are capable of immediate and accurate determination by resort to sources of
reasonably indisputable accuracy.” (Evid. Code § 452(h).)
 
Defendant’s
request is granted. 
 
D.    
Discussion
 
Defendant requests the Court to strike allegations
in the Complaint relating to Malicious Prosecution Case No. 2 as follows: 
1.     Paragraphs 8-18
on pages 3-5 of the Complaint 
2.     Paragraphs 23-26
on pages 6-7 of the Complaint
3.    
“MALICIOUS
PROCECUTION CASE NO. 2” Count and all references of said Count under first
cause of action of the Complaint, including the references in paragraphs 29,
30, 31, 32 and 34.
 
“The general statute of limitations¿for malicious prosecution is two years. (Stavropoulos
v. Superior Court¿(2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 190, 196–197; see¿§ 335.1.)
 
Defendant contends that as stated in the Complaint, the Malicious
Prosecution Case No. 2 was dismissed with prejudice on April 30, 2021. Plaintiff
filed the instant action on December 4, 2023, more than two years later and past
the statute of limitations. Since Malicious
Prosecution Case No. 2 is barred by the statute of limitations,
Defendant moves to strike the portions of the Complaint that contain the
identities of the plaintiffs and allegations of the 2020 cross-action that
relate to the Malicious Prosecution Case No. 2. 
 
In opposition, Plaintiffs argue their cause of action for malicious prosecution was tolled pursuant to Emergency Rule
No. 9 as adopted by the Judicial Council of California.
 
On April 6,
2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Judicial Council enacted¿Emergency¿Rule¿9¿of
the California¿Rules¿of Court, appendix I (Emergency¿Rule¿9), which provides
that, “[n]otwithstanding any other law, the statutes of limitations and repose
for civil causes of action that exceed 180 days are tolled from April 6, 2020,
until October 1, 2020.”¿(Cal.¿Rules¿of Court, appen. I,¿Emergency¿Rule¿9(a).) On May 29,
2020, the Judicial Council added an Advisory Committee comment to
the¿rule¿explaining that the¿rule¿“is intended to apply broadly to toll
any statute of limitations on the filing of a pleading in court asserting a
civil cause of action,” and that “[t]he term ‘civil causes of action’ includes
special proceedings.”¿(Advisory Com. com, Cal.¿Rules¿of Court, appen,
I,¿emergency¿rule¿9, (emphasis added).) Accordingly, the statute of limitations could not expire on
any civil causes of action between April 6, 2020 and October 1, 2020. (Lantzy v. Centex Homes (2003) 31 Cal.4th 363, 370
(“the limitations period stops running during the tolling event, and begins to
run again only when the tolling event has concluded.”).)
 
The Court
finds the statute of limitations on Plaintiffs’ cause of action was not tolled pursuant to Emergency Rule No. 9. As Defendant points out, the Malicious Prosecution Case No. 2 was
dismissed with prejudice on April 30, 2021. The two-year statute of limitations for Plaintiffs’
claim as to Malicious Prosecution Case No. 2 expired on April 30, 2023, and is
unaffected by the emergency rules since the tolling period of statute of
limitations ended on October 1, 2020. (Cal.¿Rules¿of Court, appen. I,¿Emergency¿Rule¿9(a).) Thus, the Court finds that Plaintiffs’ claims regarding
the Malicious Prosecution Case No. 2 is barred by the statute of limitations. 
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS Defendant’s
motion to strike.
 
III. DISPOSITION 
 

Defendant’s motion
to strike portions of the Complaint is GRANTED.
