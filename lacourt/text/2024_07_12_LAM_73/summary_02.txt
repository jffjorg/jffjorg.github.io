And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff, J.K. Residential Services Inc. and Ruben Aghrazaryn, alleges a cause of action for malicious prosecution against the defendant, NexTech Engineering Inc. The defendant argues that the plaintiff's claim is barred by the statute of limitations, as the malicious prosecution case no. 2 was dismissed with prejudice on April 30, 2021, and the two-year statute of limitations for the claim expired on April 30, 2023.

The court has found that the plaintiff's claim was not tolled by Emergency Rule No. 9, which tolled the statute of limitations for civil causes of action during the COVID-19 pandemic. The court has also found that the plaintiff's claims regarding the malicious prosecution case no. 2 are barred by the statute of limitations.

The court has granted the defendant's motion to strike the portions of the complaint that contain the identities of the plaintiffs and allegations of the 2020 cross-action that relate to the malicious prosecution case no. 2.
