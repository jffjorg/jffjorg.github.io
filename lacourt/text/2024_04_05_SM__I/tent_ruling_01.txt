  Case Number:  19SMCV02145    Hearing Date:   April 5, 2024    Dept:  I The court is inclined to DENY the ex parte because
there is no declaration of notice.  (The
declaration suggests notice was given in July 2023, which makes no sense).  But assuming notice is proper (and it might
be, given that there is an opposition), the court is still inclined to
DENY.  If the parties agreed that this
was a mere technical change that had no practical effect other than to make
sure that the right people are named as plaintiff, then the court would be
inclined either to grant the application or (more likely) request a stipulation
and order.  The fact that there is an
opposition and that plaintiff never raised the issue with the defense suggests
that there is more to it than that. 
Further, as the defense suggests, there are no exigent circumstances.
 
The matter is therefore DENIED for lack of exigent
circumstances.  The denial is WITHOUT
PREJUDICE to a regularly noticed motion or (if the parties agree) to a
stipulation and order.  The parties
should note that the court will look quite skeptically at the motion if it
jeopardizes the trial date.
 
The court does not intend to hear argument on this matter
today.
