And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the application to continue the trial, which was initially set for November 2023. The defense had a pre-planned vacation that conflicted with the trial date, but did not inform the court of the conflict until over four months later. The court is not persuaded by the defense's request to continue the trial, as they did not inform the court in a timely manner and the defense's desire not to go to trial because they want to keep working is not a valid reason. The court sets the trial date at an ex parte, and if a party finds the date inconvenient, they should have raised the issue promptly.
