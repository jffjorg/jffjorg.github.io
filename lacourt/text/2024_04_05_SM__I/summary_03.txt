And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion to compel further responses, which has been delayed by an untimely opposition from the defendant. The judge has struck the opposition and has continued the hearing to April 12, 2024. The judge notes that the opposition is similar to two other motions set for the same date, which are also late. The judge will review the opposition and allow the moving party to reply, but warns that further unexcused failures to file timely papers will result in the papers being stricken. The judge reminds the parties that they are bound by the rules of court and the Code of Civil Procedure.
