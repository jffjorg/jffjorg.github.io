 Case Number:  21STCV04325    Hearing Date:   April 5, 2024    Dept:  I The application to continue the trial is DENIED.  The court set this date in November
2023.  It was continued longer than
plaintiff sought in part to accommodate the defense.  If counsel had a trial conflict, he needed to
say it then.  Nor is the court persuaded
by defendant’s desire not to go to trial because he would like to keep working.  That is not cause at all, let alone good
cause.  The only thing that is close is
the pre-planned vacation.  The court set
the trial date at an ex parte.  If
it turned out that the date was not convenient to a party, that would have been
cause to change it.  However, it was
incumbent on the defense to raise the issue promptly.  The court has no idea why defendant waited
over four months before telling anyone of the conflict even though it was known
immediately.  If it was not important
enough to inform the court in a timely manner, it is not important enough to
move everyone’s calendars.  
 
The court does not intend to hear argument on this matter.
