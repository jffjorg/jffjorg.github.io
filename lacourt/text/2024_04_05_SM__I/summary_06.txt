And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is not convinced by Cenlar's reasons for continuing the trial, except possibly for the email issue. The judge believes that the parties' failure to complete discovery in a timely manner is not a valid reason for a continuance, as counsel's conflicts are their own problem and should have been raised earlier. However, the judge is willing to consider a continuance if Cenlar can show that the email issue caused a delay that is now prejudicial. The judge is setting a hearing for April 16, 2024, to hear arguments on the email issue and potential discovery, and is asking Cenlar to file a brief outlining the additional discovery it claims it needs. The judge reminds the parties that they must comply with the court's rules and sanctions will be imposed if they do not. The judge is trying to manage a heavy caseload and is not willing to continue trials without good cause.
