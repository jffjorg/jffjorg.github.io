And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge is inclined to deny the plaintiff's application to continue the trial, citing a scheduling conflict and the plaintiff's recent change of doctor and inability to attend the defense medical examination. The Judge believes that these issues are not good cause for a continuance, as the trial has already been set for a year and the plaintiff's decision to see a new doctor and change counsel has caused the delay. The Judge notes that the court has a heavy docket of 1000 cases and is working on the assumption that 11 out of 12 cases will settle or resolve, leaving little room for continuances. The Judge warns that if the plaintiff does not make herself available for the defense medical examination quickly, she may have difficulty presenting her case to a jury. The Judge will hear argument, but will likely require a dramatic and unforeseeable change in the plaintiff's condition and an affirmative showing that there would be no prejudice to the defense in order to reconsider the continuance.
