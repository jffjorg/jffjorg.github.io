 Case Number:  22SMCV01859    Hearing Date:   April 5, 2024    Dept:  I The matter is here for a motion to compel further
responses.  The court is in receipt of
the untimely opposition, which is STRICKEN. 
No good reason was given for the extremely late opposition and the
moving party has had no opportunity to reply.
 
That said, the matter seems to be substantively similar to
two other motions set for April 12, 2024. 
The matter is CONTINUED to that date. 
The court notes that those oppositions are also untimely.  The court would normally be inclined to
STRIKE them as well, but the court believes that the better course would be to
review them but allow the moving party to reply.  The court will inquire of the moving party
whether it believes it needs more time to reply and, if so, when the reply
would be filed.  The court reminds the
moving party that the court reads these papers and works them up, so the sooner
the reply is in, the more appreciative the court will be.  Plaintiff and plaintiff’s counsel are
reminded that they are bound by the rules of court and the Code of Civil
Procedure.  Further unexcused failures to
file timely papers will result in the papers being stricken and the court will
consider whether or not to view it as a concession that the motion has
merit—something the court typically does not do and did not do here (when it
thought the motion to be unopposed).
