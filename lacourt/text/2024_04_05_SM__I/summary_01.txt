And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is inclined to deny the ex parte motion because there is no declaration of notice, which suggests that notice was given in July 2023, which makes no sense. Even if notice was proper, the judge would still deny the motion. The judge believes that the parties may be hiding something, as the plaintiff never raised the issue with the defense, and the opposition was filed. Furthermore, there are no exigent circumstances that would justify the motion. The motion is denied without prejudice, meaning it can be re-filed with proper notice. The judge warns that the motion will be viewed skeptically if it jeopardizes the trial date.
