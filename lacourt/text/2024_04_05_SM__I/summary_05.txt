And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to compel responses to discovery in part, denying the request for responses to certain requests for production (RFPs). The judge found that the defendant failed to respond to discovery despite extensions being granted, and that the failure was not justified. However, the judge also found that some of the RFPs were facially improper and went beyond the normal scope of discovery. Specifically, RFPs 20-23 requested that defendants produce images of their drivers' licenses, passports, official identity cards, and social security cards, which the judge deemed unnecessary and potentially invasive.

The judge granted the motion to compel responses to all RFPs except RFPs 20-23, which were denied. The judge also granted sanctions as prayed, imposing a total of $1,610.50 in sanctions on the defendant. The judge reminded the parties that there is an upcoming trial date and expects full compliance with the court's rules and procedures.

Overall, the judge's ruling aims to ensure that the parties comply with their discovery obligations and to prevent future delays and disputes.
