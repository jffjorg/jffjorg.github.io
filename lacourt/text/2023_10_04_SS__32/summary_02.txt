And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 21STCV32162, denying the defendants' motion to shorten the time for the hearing on their motion for summary judgment. The defendants, Timothy Fratt and Empire Transportation Inc., had filed the motion on July 25, 2023, seeking to have their motion heard prior to trial. The plaintiff, Ella Jackson, argued that she would suffer extreme prejudice if the hearing was set on October 11, 2023, as she would not have sufficient time to prepare and oppose the motion. The Judge agrees with the plaintiff and notes that the Eighth Amended Standing Order for Procedures in the Personal Injury Hub prohibits the court from hearing multiple ex parte applications or shortening time to add hearings to a fully booked motion calendar. The Judge also suggests that the defendants' prejudice can be mitigated by continuing the trial date. The defendants are ordered to give notice of the court's order and file a proof of service.
