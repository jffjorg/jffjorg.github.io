The Judge also suggests that the defendants' prejudice can be mitigated by continuing the trial date. The defendants are ordered to give notice of the court's order and file a proof of service.

Here's the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling in Case No. 21STCV32162 denies the defendants' motion to shorten the time for a hearing on their motion for summary judgment. The case was filed on August 31, 2021, and the answer was filed on March 14, 2022. The defendants filed their motion for summary judgment and a motion to shorten the time for the hearing on July 25, 2023. The court previously denied the defendants' ex parte application to shorten the time for the hearing.

The court agrees with the plaintiff that she would suffer extreme prejudice if the hearing were set for October 11, 2023, as it would not leave enough time to oppose the motion. The court also notes that the Eighth Amended Standing Order for Procedures in the Personal Injury Hub does not allow for the court to hear multiple ex parte applications or to shorten the time to add hearings to their fully booked motion calendars.

Instead of granting the motion, the court suggests that the defendants could mitigate the prejudice of not having their summary judgment motion heard before the trial by continuing the trial date. Therefore, the court denies the defendants' motion to shorten the time for the hearing. The defendants must give notice of the court's order and file a proof of service of the notice.

Summary:
The Judge's tentative ruling in case number 21STCV32162 concerns the denial of the Defendants' motion to shorten time on hearing for motion for summary judgment. This motion was filed by Defendants Timothy Fratt and Empire Transportation Inc. on July 25, 2023, and opposed by the Plaintiff, Ella Jackson. The Judge has previously ruled on the same request in the Defendants' ex parte application filed on August 3, 2023, which was denied.

The Judge highlights that the Eighth Amended Standing Order for Procedures in the Personal Injury Hub does not allow for multiple ex parte applications or shortening time to add hearings to their fully booked motion calendars. The Defendants' extreme prejudice of not having their summary judgment motion heard prior to trial can be mitigated by continuing the trial date.

The Judge encourages the parties to meet and confer concerning this tentative ruling to determine if a resolution may be reached. If the parties are unable to reach a resolution and a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling, they must send an email to the Court at sscdept32@lacourt.org indicating their intention. If the Court does not receive such an email and there are no appearances at the hearing, the Court may place the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.
