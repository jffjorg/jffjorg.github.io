And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Petition to Confirm Attorney-Client Fee Arbitration Award, filed by Emahn Counts of Counts Law Firm, P.C. on June 7, 2024, is continued to December 3, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. in Department 25 at the Spring Street Courthouse. The Petitioner must file a proof of service demonstrating that Respondent, Calvin Valrie, was given notice of the hearing at least 16 court days before the next scheduled hearing. Failure to do so may result in the Petition being placed off calendar or denied.

The Court finds that the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure sections 1283.6, 1285, 1285.4, 1288, 1288.4, and 1290.4 have been satisfied. The arbitration award, rendered by Arbitrator Gregory R. Vanni, requires Respondent to pay Petitioner $11,936.16. Respondent did not respond to written communications regarding settling the matter and did not appear or participate in the arbitration.

The Court's analysis is based on the legal standard that an arbitrator's award is enforceable only when confirmed as a judgment of the superior court. The Court must select one of four courses of action: confirm the award, correct and confirm it, vacate it, or dismiss the petition. The Court may not review the merits of the dispute, the sufficiency of the evidence, or the arbitrator's reasoning, nor may it correct or review an award because of an arbitrator's legal or factual error.
