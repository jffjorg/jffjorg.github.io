ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On May 1, 2024, Arbitrator Gregory R. Vanni (the
“Arbitrator”) from the San Gabriel Valley Lawyer Referral Service rendered an
award requiring Respondent Calvin Valrie (“Respondent”) to pay $11,936.16 to Petitioner
Emahn Counts of Counts Law Firm, P.C. (“Petitioner”) for legal assistance
rendered in connection with a divorce and custody matter.  (Petn., Attach. Exh. 6(c), pp. 3, 7.)  Respondent did not respond to written
communications regarding settling the matter and did not appear or participate
in the arbitration. (Petn., Attach. Exh. 6(c), p. 4.) In addition to written
communication, the Arbitrator noted Respondent was also left a voice message to
confirm the arbitration and a window of time was provided for him to join the
hearing. (Petn., Attach. Exh. 6(c), p. 4.) 

 
On June 7, 2024, Petitioner filed the instant Petition to
Confirm Attorney-Client Fee Arbitration Award (the “Petition”). Notably, there
were various issues serving Respondent in this matter (8/6/24 App. for Pub.;
Petn. Attach. Exh. 6(c), p. 3), but Petitioner eventually served Respondent with
the Petition by way of publication. (9/5/24 Proof of Pub.)  
 
No opposition was filed.
 
II.                
Legal
Standard 
 
“Regardless of the particular relief granted, any
arbitrator’s award is enforceable only when confirmed as a judgment of the
superior court.”  (O’Hare v. Municipal Resource Consultants¿(2003)
107 Cal.App.4th 267, 278.)  “Once a petition to confirm an award is filed,
the superior court must select one of only four courses of action: it may
confirm the award, correct and confirm it, vacate it, or dismiss the
petition.”  (EHM Productions, Inc. v. Starline Tours of Hollywood,
Inc.¿(2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 1058, 1063.) “It is well settled that the
scope of judicial review of arbitration awards is extremely narrow.”  (California
Faculty Assn. v. Superior Court¿(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 935, 943.)  
 
“Neither the trial court, nor the appellate court, may
‘review the merits of the dispute, the sufficiency of the evidence, or the
arbitrator’s reasoning, nor may we correct or review an award because of an
arbitrator’s legal or factual error, even if it appears on the award’s
face.”  (EHM Productions, supra, 21 Cal.App.5th at pp.
1063-64.) 
 
III.             
Discussion

 
A. Filing Requirements (Code Civ. Proc., §
1285.4) 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1285.4 states: “A
petition under this chapter shall: 
 
(a)   Set forth the substance of or have
attached a copy of the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies the
existence of such an agreement. 
(b)   Set forth the names of the
arbitrators. 
(c) Set forth or have attached a copy of the award and
the written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.” 
 
            Here, Petitioner sets forth in the
Petition the name of the Arbitrator, Gregory Vanni, (Pet. ¶4) and submits a
copy of the Arbitration Award, titled “Mandatory Fee Arbitration Program,” which
was written and signed by the Arbitrator Gregory R. Vanni. (Pet., ¶6(c),
Attach. Exh. 6(c).) 
 
            Thus, Petitioner has satisfied the
requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1285.4.
 
B. Service of the Petition, and Notice of Hearing
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.4.)  
¿ 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1290.4 states, in
pertinent part:  
 
(a)   “A copy of the petition and a written
notice of the time and place of the hearing thereof and any other papers upon
which the petition is based shall be served in the manner provided in the
arbitration agreement for the service of such petition and notice. 
(b)   If the arbitration agreement does not
provide the manner in which such service shall be made and the person upon whom
service is to be made has not previously appeared in the proceeding and has not
previously been served in accordance with this subdivision: ¶ (1) Service
within this State shall be made in the manner provided by law for the service
of summons in an action.” 
 
Here, Petitioner filed proof of service demonstrating
that Respondent was served on the Petition by way of publication in the Los
Angeles Daily Journal’s August 14, 2024, August 21, 2024, August 28, 2024, and
September 4, 2024 issues.  (9/5/24 Proof
of Pub.) 
 
However, Petitioner did not service a notice of the
Court’s June 7 order setting the hearing on the Petition to October 11, 2024. (6/7/24
Minute Order.) 
 
Thus, the service requirements of Code of Civil Procedure
section 1290.4 have not been satisfied. 
 
C. Service of the Arbitration Award & Timeliness
of Petition (CCP §§ 1283.6, 1288, 1288.4) 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1283.6 provides that:
“The neutral arbitrator shall serve a signed copy of the award on each
party to the arbitration personally or by registered or certified mail or as
provided in the agreement.”¿ 
 
“A petition to confirm an award shall be served and filed
not later than four years after the date of service of a signed copy of the
award on the petitioner. A petition to vacate an award or to correct an award
shall be served and filed not later than 100 days after the date of the service
of a signed copy of the award on the petitioner.” (Code of Civ. Proc., § 1288.)

 
“No petition [to confirm arbitration award] may be served
and filed … until at least 10 days after service of the signed copy of the
award upon the petitioner.” (Code of Civ. Proc., § 1288.4.) 
 
“[B]efore a court can enter an arbitrator’s award as its
judgment, the parties must have the notice of the award. … ‘[T]he superior
court is without jurisdiction to act further in the matter until the parties
are served or otherwise obtain actual notice of the award.’ ”(Domingo v. Los
Angeles County Metropolitan Transp. Auth. (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 550, 554.) 
 
Here, the arbitration award includes proof of service that
the San Gabriel Valley Lawyer Referral Service served a copy of the arbitration
award on Petitioner and Respondent by mail on May 2, 2024. (Petn., Attach. Exh.
6(c), p. 13.) 
 
In addition, a party may seek a court judgment confirming
an arbitration award by serving and filing a petition no more than four years,
but not less than 10 days, after the award was served.  (Code of Civ. Proc., §§ 1288, 1288.4.) Here, the
arbitration award was served on May 2, 2024, and the Petition was filed more
than 10 days and less than four years later, on June 7, 2024. 
 
Thus, the Court finds the requirements of Code of Civil
Procedure sections 1283.6, 1288, 1288.4 are satisfied.
