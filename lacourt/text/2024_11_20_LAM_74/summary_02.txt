Here is the summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to stay proceedings filed by Nasrin and Susan Mansoori, defendants in the lawsuit brought by Automotive LLC against Bidlane LLC et al. The motion was based on the ongoing investigation by the Department of Motor Vehicles and potential criminal litigation related to the fraud and breach of contract claims. The judge found that the defendants had failed to show that they were personally under investigation by the DMV and had also failed to demonstrate how truthful testimony subject to the Fifth Amendment privilege would be helpful in their defense. The judge considered the legal standard for staying proceedings in light of a parallel criminal case and concluded that the defendants had not met the necessary showing to justify a stay.
