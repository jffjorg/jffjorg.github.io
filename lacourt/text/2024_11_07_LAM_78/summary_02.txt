```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the Plaintiffs' Motion to Continue Trial, which seeks a six-month continuance of the trial date. The main reasons for the continuance are the death of Defendant Jan Tarble, the need for the new personal representative for Tarble's Estate to give notice to creditors and file a motion to substitute, and the Plaintiffs' excused inability to obtain essential discovery. The judge agrees that these circumstances constitute "good cause" for a continuance, as outlined in California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332. The judge also notes that the Court's calendar cannot accommodate the trial as currently scheduled. Therefore, the judge grants the Plaintiffs' Motion to Continue Trial for six months.
