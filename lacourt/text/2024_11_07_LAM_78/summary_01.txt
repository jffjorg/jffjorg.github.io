And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Del Sol's motion for consolidation of the two lawsuits. Del Sol sought to consolidate the two actions, which were filed by different parties and involved different causes of action. The judge found that the actions did not involve the same parties and did not contain predominating overlapping issues of law or fact. The judge also noted that the actions involved distinct questions of law and fact and that consolidation would confuse the issues for the jury. The judge concluded that consolidation was not appropriate and denied the motion.
