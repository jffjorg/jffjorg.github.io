And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that Defendant Socure, Inc.'s motion to dismiss the action for inconvenient forum is granted. The parties had agreed to a forum selection clause in the 11-15-18 Software License Agreement, which designates New York as the exclusive forum for resolving disputes. The judge finds that the forum selection clause is reasonable and enforceable, and that it encompasses all of Plaintiff Aspiration Partners, Inc.'s claims, including tort claims. The judge has rejected Plaintiff's arguments that the forum selection clause is not broad enough to cover tort claims and that it would be unfair to require Plaintiff to litigate the breach of contract cause of action in New York, while litigating the tort causes of action in California. The judge has also rejected Plaintiff's argument that the enforcement of the forum selection clause would diminish the right to reciprocal attorneys' fees under California Civil Code section 1717.
