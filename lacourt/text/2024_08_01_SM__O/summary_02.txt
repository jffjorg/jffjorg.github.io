And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Socure Inc., has moved to dismiss the action against it based on the forum selection clause in the 11-15-18 Software License Agreement (SLA). The clause requires that any disputes arising out of the agreement be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts having jurisdiction in New York, New York.

The court finds that the forum selection clause is enforceable and covers all of the plaintiff's claims, including tort claims for fraudulent inducement and negligent misrepresentation. The court also finds that the selected forum of New York has a logical connection with Socure because of its principle place of business.

The court rejects the plaintiff's argument that the forum selection clause is unreasonable and unfair because it would require it to litigate the breach of contract cause of action in New York and the tort causes of action in California. The court also finds that the plaintiff's argument that it would lose its right to reciprocal attorneys' fees under California Civil Code ยง 1717 is unfounded.

Therefore, the court grants the motion to dismiss for inconvenient forum and dismisses the action.
