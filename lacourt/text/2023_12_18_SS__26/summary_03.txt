The judge has denied the Petition to Declare Mobilehome Abandoned filed by Petitioner Sun-West Properties and Investments, Inc. dba Sunrise Estates against Respondents Dennis Garcia, Eugenia Cruz, and Greentree ACPT, Inc. The court found that the Petition is not supported by sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the mobilehome is abandoned, as required by Civil Code section 798.61. Specifically, the court noted that the Petitioner failed to provide an affidavit or evidence of the monthly rent owed on the mobilehome space, and that the Petitioner did not provide evidence of the attorney's fees and costs incurred. The court also found that the Petitioner did not satisfy the requirements of Civil Code section 798.61, subdivision (b), regarding notice of abandonment. As a result, the court denied the Petition and ordered that the Court clerk give notice.
