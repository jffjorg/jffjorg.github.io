And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, with 20 days' leave to amend the complaint. The plaintiff's motion to bifurcate is advanced to December 21, 2023, and continued to March 21, 2024. The judge finds that the complaint does not adequately state a cause of action for recovery of COVID-19 rental debt, and that the small claims court does not have exclusive jurisdiction over these cases. The plaintiff is given an opportunity to amend the complaint to state a valid cause of action.
