Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Covina Hills MHC v. Souza, et al. The Petitioner, Covina Hills MHC, has filed a Petition to Declare Mobilehome Abandoned against the Respondent, Eugenia Souza. The Petitioner claims that the mobilehome is abandoned and seeks a court order deeming it abandoned and awarding rent due on the space.

The judge has denied the Petition due to lack of evidence supporting the allegations. Specifically, the Petitioner has not submitted a declaration attesting to the facts alleged in the Petition, and the Notice of Belief of Abandonment was not served on the Respondent.

The judge has also struck the Cross-complaint filed by the Respondent, citing improper filing. The Cross-complaint was filed in response to the Petition, but the judge has determined that it was not properly filed as a cross-complaint.

Finally, the judge has denied the Respondent's request to continue the hearing date. The Petitioner has not filed supplemental papers in support of the Petition, and the Court has determined that the Petition is not properly supported by evidence.
