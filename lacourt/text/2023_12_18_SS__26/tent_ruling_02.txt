ANALYSIS: 
 
Plaintiff Samara A. Weiner (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant
action for recovery of COVID-19 rental debt against Defendants Century Property
Management & Investment, Inc. and Deion Gerhard (“Defendants”) on July 27,
2022. Defendants filed an answer and cross-complaint against Plaintiff, Art
Koomer, and Michael Koomer on November 23, 2022. Arthur Koomer and Michael also
filed cross-complaints against unnamed cross-defendants on May 18, 2023 and
June 30, 2023, respectively.
 
Plaintiff’s notice of related case was denied on August 17,
2023 and her ex parte application to consolidate related actions was denied on
the same date. On November 9, 2023, Defendants filed the instant Motion for Judgment
on the Pleadings. Plaintiff filed an
opposition on November 27, 2023 and Defendants replied on December 11, 2023.
 
Discussion
 
Defendants move for judgment on
the pleadings with respect to the Complaint on the basis that the Court lacks
jurisdiction to hear an action for COVID-19 rental debt and insufficient facts
are alleged to support the cause of action asserted therein. The Motion is
brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 438, pursuant to which the
parties are required to meet and confer. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 438, 439.) The
Motion is accompanied by a meet and confer declaration, as required. (Motion,
Blaylock Decl., ¶¶6-9 and Exhs. B-E.)
 
Substantively, the standard for
ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings is essentially the same as
that applicable to a general demurrer, that is, under the state of the
pleadings, together with matters that may be judicially noticed, it appears
that a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  (Bezirdjian v. O’Reilly (2010) 183
Cal.App.4th 316, 321-322, citing Schabarum v. California Legislature
(1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1205, 1216.) Matters which are subject to mandatory
judicial notice may be treated as part of the complaint and may be considered
without notice to the parties. Matters which are subject to permissive judicial
notice must be specified in the notice of motion, the supporting points and
authorities, or as the court otherwise permits. (Id.)  The motion may not be supported by extrinsic
evidence. (Barker v. Hull (1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 221, 236.)
 
Plaintiff brings the instant
Complaint on the Judicial Council form for recovery of COVID-19 rental debt.
Plaintiff alleges that they were the tenant in possession of 205 S. Sparks
Street, Burbank, California (“the Residence”) pursuant to a lease agreement
with Defendants entered into over a decade ago. (Compl., ¶8c.) Defendants now
allegedly discriminate and retaliate against Plaintiff based on income. (Ibid.)
Defendants entered into the COVID-19 rental debt program (“the Program”), which
was a binding contract with the California government. (Ibid.) Pursuant
to this contract, Defendants expressly agreed that payment under the Program
would be full payment of the entire rental debt owed by the tenant for the
specified time period. (Ibid.) Although Defendants accepted payment in
full of rental debt owed by Plaintiff on June 8, 2022, on June 15, 2022,
Defendants began wrongfully demanding payment from Plaintiff of a balance of
$18,245.00. (Compl., ¶9.) This demand was in violation of the Program, as was
the termination of Plaintiff’s tenancy, breaching Defendants’ contract with the
government and retaliating against Plaintiff. (Ibid.) 
 
Defendants advance two arguments
in support of the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. First, that this Court
lacks jurisdiction to hear a claim for COVID-19 rental debt because
jurisdiction for these claims belongs solely to the small claims court, and
that the cause of action is insufficiently alleged. Regarding the
jurisdictional argument, Defendants point to Code of Civil Procedure section
116.223, which states in relevant part: “Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of
subdivision (a) Section 116.220, Section 116.221, or any other law, the small
claims court has jurisdiction in any action for recovery of COVID-19 rental
debt, as defined in Section 1179.02, and any defenses thereto, regardless of
the amount demanded.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 116.223, subd. (b)(1).) The statute,
however, does not indicate that the small claims court has exclusive jurisdiction
over these cases and Defendants provide no legal authority for why the language
of the statute should be read to assign exclusive jurisdiction. Also, the “notwithstanding”
language points to sections that dictate the jurisdiction of the small claims
court, which suggests that section 116.223 is an simply exception to that rule
but otherwise has no bearing on the jurisdiction of the limited and unlimited
civil courts to hear actions for recovery of COVID-19 rental debt. The
jurisdiction of the limited jurisdiction court is set forth at Civil Code
sections 85, et seq. and Defendants have not shown that an action for COVID-19
rental debt is outside those provisions. Therefore, the Court finds that it
does not lack jurisdiction over this action, if it is one for COVID-19 rental
debt, on those grounds.
 
Next, Defendants argue that this
action fails to allege a cause of action for recovery of COVID-19 rental debt
because Plaintiff does not satisfy the statutory requirements. Defendants argue
that relief under the COVID-19 rental debt program “clearly refers to the
rights of landlords to collect rental debts owed by tenants due to tenants’
inability to pay said rents” due to the COVID-19 pandemic emergency. In support
of this, Defendants cite Code of Civil Procedure section 1179.02, which defines
“COVID-19 rental debt” as “unpaid rent or any other unpaid financial obligation
of a tenant under the tenancy that came due during the covered time period.”
(Code Civ. Proc., §1179.02, subd. (c).) It follows that a tenant cannot bring a
claim for their unpaid financial obligation under this statute because it
concerns the obligations owed by tenants, not owed to tenants. Defendants also
point out that under subdivision (a), the “covered time period” is “the time
period between March 1, 2020, and September 30,
2021.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1179.02, subd. (a).) The conduct of Defendants at
issue in this action, however, started after this, in May 2022. (Compl., ¶8.) Therefore,
Defendants have demonstrated Plaintiff has not alleged facts sufficient to assert
a cause of action for recovery of COVID-19 rental debt. 
 
Plaintiff’s opposition arguments
fail to demonstrate that an adequate cause of action has been alleged. The
opposition points to no allegations in the Complaint that state a claim for
recovery of COVID-19 rental debt by a tenant and instead argues that Defendants
are liable for breach of the contract with the California government. (Opp., p.
3:2-9.) Nor is any authority cited for this argument. Plaintiff’s other
arguments either rely entirely on legal authority without analysis of how they
apply to this action, or make unfounded claims by citing no legal authority.
For example, even if there was evidence of bad faith by Defendants in bringing
this Motion, that is not grounds to deny judgment on the pleadings. (Id.
at p. 1:23-28.) 
 
Plaintiff requests leave to amend
the Complaint, which Defendants oppose. It appears that Plaintiff is attempting
to erroneously allege a cause of action for housing discrimination and/or
harassment by landlords via a judicial council for recovery of COVID-19 rental
debt. Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff leave to amend to attempt to
state the appropriate cause of action.

Defendants
Century Property Management & Investment, Inc. and Deion Gerhard’s Motion for
Judgment on the Pleadings of the Complaint is GRANTED WITH 20 DAYS LEAVE TO
AMEND.
