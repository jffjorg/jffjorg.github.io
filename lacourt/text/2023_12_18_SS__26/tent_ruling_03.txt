On March 27, 2023, Petitioner Sun-West

instant Petition to Declare Mobilehome Abandoned against Respondents Dennis
Garcia aka Dennis J. Garcia (“Respondent Garcia”), Eugenia Cruz aka Eugenia A.

Petitioner’s first request for entry of default against Respondents was
rejected by the clerk’s office on June 12, 2023.
 
The instant Petition came for
hearing on July 31, 2023 and was continued to allow Petitioner to correct
deficiencies in service and supporting evidence. (Minute Order, 07/31/23.) On
July 31, 2023, the clerk’s office rejected Petitioner’s second request for
entry of default. Petitioner also filed proof of substitute service on July 31,
2023. 
 
The Petition initially came for
hearing on November 7, 2023 and was continued to November 29, 2023. (Minute
Order, 11/29/23.) The hearing was again continued to December 18, 2023. (Minute
Order, 11/29/23.) Also, on December 1, 2023, the Court entered default against
Respondents Garcia and Cruz. (Request for Entry of Judgment, 12/01/23.) To
date, Petitioner has not filed supplemental papers in support of the Petition, as
ordered. 
 
Discussion
 
Pursuant
to Civil Code section 798.61, Petitioner
seeks a court order deeming Respondents’ mobilehome, (“the Mobilehome”) located
at 45131 N. 28th Street E, Space 3, Lancaster California (“the Space”), to be
abandoned, and awarding Petitioner rent due on the Mobilehome site from January
1, 2021 to the present, accruing at $403.90 per month, plus other charges,
attorney’s fees, and costs. (Pet., ¶¶6-10 and Prayer ¶¶1-7.) 
 
A. Determination of “Abandoned Mobilehome”—Civ. Code § 798.61(a)(1)
 
As
no default has been entered against Respondent Greentree ACPT, Inc., Petitioner
must prove the Petition by a preponderance of the evidence. (Code Civ. Proc., §
798.61, subd. (d)(2).) Pursuant to Civil Code, section 798.61, subdivision (a)(1),
an “abandoned mobilehome” means a mobilehome about which all of the following
are true:
 
(A) It is located in a
mobilehome park on a site for which no rent has been paid to the management for
the preceding 60 days.
 
(B)
It is unoccupied.
 
(C)
A reasonable person would believe it to be abandoned.
 
(D)
It is not permanently affixed to the land.
 
(Civ. Code, § 798.61, subd. (a)(1).) The Petition is still not
supported by any declaration or other admissible evidence. Only three pages of
unauthenticated exhibits are attached to the Petition that purport to show
service of a Notice of Abandonment on Respondents on February 16, 2023.
Therefore, the Petition has not demonstrated that the Mobilehome is unoccupied
or that a reasonable person would believe the Mobilehome to be abandoned within
the meaning of Civil Code section 798.61, subdivision (a)(1).
 
 
 
B.         Notice of Belief of Abandonment—Civ.
Code § 798.61(b)
 
Civil Code, section
798.61, subdivision (b) requires: 
 
“After determining a mobilehome
in a mobilehome park to be an abandoned mobilehome, the management shall post a
notice of belief of abandonment on the mobilehome for not less than 30 days,
and shall deposit copies of the notice in the United States mail, postage
prepaid, addressed to the homeowner at the last known address and to any known
registered owner, if different from the homeowner, and to any known holder of a
security interest in the abandoned mobilehome. This notice shall be mailed by
registered or certified mail with a return receipt requested.”


(Civ. Code, § 798.61, subd. (b).) Petitioner attached a
Notice of Abandonment to the Petition, which indicates that it was served on
Respondent Greentree by posting and certified mail. (Pet., Exh. 1.) As noted
above, however, the exhibits are not authenticated or otherwise shown to be
admissible. Therefore, Petitioner has not satisfied the requirements of Civil
Code, section 798.61, subdivision (b).
 
C.        Petition for Judicial Declaration—Civ.
Code § 798.61(c)
 
Civil Code, section 798.61(c)(1) states:
 
“Thirty or more days following posting
pursuant to subdivision (b), the management may file a petition in the superior
court in the county in which the mobilehome park is located, for a judicial
declaration of abandonment of the mobilehome. A proceeding under this
subdivision is a limited civil case.  Copies
of the petition shall be served upon the homeowner, any known registered owner,
and any known person having a lien or security interest of record in the
mobilehome by posting a copy on the mobilehome and mailing copies to those
persons at their last known addresses by registered or certified mail with a
return receipt requested in the United States mail, postage prepaid.”  (Emphasis added.)
 
(Civ. Code, § 798.61, subd. (c)(1).) Lancaster is located
within the County of Los Angeles, which is within this Court’s jurisdiction. If
the Court were to consider the Notice of Abandonment, the instant Petition was
filed more than 30 days later. Petitioner has now shown proper service of the
Petition and initial Notice of Hearing on Respondent Greentree. (Proof of
Service, filed 07/31/23.) 
 
D.        Charges, Attorneys’ Fees, and Costs
 
“If, at the hearing, the petitioner shows by a preponderance
of the evidence that the criteria for an abandoned mobilehome has been
satisfied and no party establishes an interest therein at the hearing and
tenders all past due rent and other charges, the court shall enter a judgment
of abandonment, determine the amount of charges to which the petitioner is
entitled, and award attorney's fees and costs to the petitioner.” (Civ. Code, §
798.61, subd. (d)(2).) Petitioner asks for accrued rent/storage fees on the
Space in the amount of $10,379.22 based on monthly rent of $403.90 per month
from January 1, 2021 through March 31, 2023 (27 months or 819 days), plus other
charges, attorney’s fees, and costs. (Pet., ¶¶6-10.) It is not clear how the
total rent amount was calculated because $10,379.22 is not the sum of $403.90
multiplied by 27 months. 
 
Furthermore, the Petition is not supported by an affidavit
or evidence of the monthly rent owed on the Mobilehome Space or when
Respondents stopped paying rent and other charges. Finally, the Petition is not
supported by an affidavit or evidence of the attorney’s fees and costs incurred
by Petitioner. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, Petitioner Sun-West Properties and
Investments, Inc. dba Sunrise Estates’ Petition to Declare Mobilehome Abandoned
is DENIED.
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
