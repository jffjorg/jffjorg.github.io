And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is in response to a motion to compel further responses to discovery requests filed by the defendant, Clearpath Federal Credit Union, in a wrongful termination action brought by plaintiff Fredrick Smith. The motion seeks to compel the plaintiff to provide verifications and further responses to requests for production, as well as to compel the plaintiff's statement of compliance to produce documents. The court finds that the plaintiff failed to provide verified responses and has failed to produce all documents as indicated in their response. As a result, the court grants the motion and orders the plaintiff to provide verifications for their responses to the requests for production and to produce documents consistent with their unverified statements of compliance. The court also grants the defendant's request for sanctions and imposes a monetary sanction of $1,480 on the plaintiff.
