**Tentative Ruling**

This tentative ruling is issued by Judge Kerry Bensinger in the case of Aaron Birt v. Cali Movers, Inc. The plaintiff, a self-represented litigant, filed a lawsuit against Cali Movers, Inc. and several individual defendants for breach of contract. The defendants, Monica Laborico, Jay Beckett, and Oswaldo Flores, filed demurrers to the plaintiff's first amended complaint. However, due to the plaintiff's subsequent filing of an amended complaint naming Cali Movers, Inc. as the sole defendant, the demurrers filed by the defendants are deemed MOOT. The court has granted the plaintiff's ex parte application to file a first amended complaint, and the demurrers filed by the defendants are hereby dismissed.
