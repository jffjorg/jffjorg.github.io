MOTION
TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO DISCOVERY



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant
Clearpath Federal Credit Union
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.
         INTRODUCTION
 
This is a wrongful termination action.  On October 10, 2023, Michael J. Jaurigue and
Amanda L. Thompson, counsel for Plaintiff, Fredrick Smith, filed a Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel.  The court granted
the motion on January 5, 2024.  As such,
Plaintiff is currently self-represented. 
 
On October 12, 2023, Defendant, Clearpath Federal Credit
Union, filed these motions to compel Plaintiff’s verifications and further
responses to Requests for Production, Set One, Nos. 13, 14, 18, 19, 25, and 28-30,
and to compel Plaintiff’s verifications to Form Interrogatories (General) and
Form Interrogatories (Employment).  Defendant
seeks sanctions against Plaintiff.  
 
The motions were scheduled to be heard on March 1 and 5,
2024.  On March 1, 2024, the court
directed Defendant to serve Plaintiff with these motions by personal service.  The motions were continued to April 26, 2024
to allow Defendant to effectuate personal service. 
 
On March 19, 2024, Defendant filed a Notice of Personal
Service.
 
The motions are unopposed.
 
Although titled a motion to compel further responses, the court
notes that Defendant’s motion to compel verifications and further responses to
Requests for Production seek an order compelling Plaintiff’s compliance with
the inspection demand.  Therefore, the
court construes the motion to compel further as a motion to compel compliance.
 
II.        LEGAL
STANDARDS
 
            Compel Compliance
                
If a party filing a response to a demand for
inspection, copying, testing or sampling thereafter fails to permit the
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling in accordance with that party’s
statement of compliance, the demanding party may move for an order compelling
compliance.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.320, subd. (a).)¿
 
            Compel
Initial Responses
 
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to
serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order to compel
responses without objections.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (b).)¿ “Unsworn
responses are tantamount to no responses at all.”¿ (Appleton v. Superior
Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.)  Failure to timely serve
responses waives objections to the requests.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (a).)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
 
Monetary Sanctions
 
            Code of
Civil Procedure section 2023.030 is a general statute authorizing the Court to
impose discovery sanctions for “misuse of the discovery process,” which
includes (without limitation) a variety of conduct such as: making, without
substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an
evasive response to discovery; and unsuccessfully and without substantial
justification making or opposing a motion to compel or limit discovery.¿ (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.)¿¿¿¿ 
¿ 
If sanctions are sought, Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.040 requires that the notice specify the identity of the person against
whom sanctions are sought and the type of sanction requested, that the motion
be supported in the points and authorities, and the facts be set forth in a
declaration supporting the amount of any monetary sanction.¿¿¿ 
¿ 
If the court finds that a party has unsuccessfully made or
opposed a motion to compel responses to interrogatories or inspection demands,
the court “shall impose a monetary sanction . . . unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.320, subd. (b).)¿¿¿¿¿ 
 
III.       DISCUSSION
 
            Defendant seeks an order compelling Plaintiff to provide
verifications to Requests for Production, Form Interrogatories (General), and
Form Interrogatories (Employment), and to compel Plaintiff’s statement of
compliance to produce documents.  The
court addresses each discovery set in turn.
 
A.   
Requests for Production
 
Defendant seeks an order compelling Plaintiff’s
verifications to Defendant’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, and
an order compelling Plaintiff to comply with his statement of compliance to
Nos. 13, 14, 18, 19, 25, and 28-30.  The
requests seek the following:
 
·        
Nos. 14 & 28: Medical provider’s
records when Plaintiff was released to return to work and began searching for a
new job; 
·        
No. 19: EDD and unemployment
benefits offsetting any loss of earnings claims; Nos. 13, 18: Job search
records for mitigation of damages; 
·        
Nos. 13 & 25: Records of new job
to support claim that new position has no benefits; 
·        
No 29: Medical records for emotional
distress claim; 
·        
No. 30: Records of any other damage
suffered.
In response, Plaintiff provided
unverified statements of compliance and has either failed to produce all
documents as indicated in his response (see Nos. 13, 14, 28, 29, 30) or has
failed to produce any documents at all (see Nos. 18, 19, 25 ).  Defendant is entitled to verified responses
and an order compelling Plaintiff’s compliance with the inspection demands.
B.    
Form Interrogatories (General and Employment)
It is undisputed that Defenant
properly served these discovery requests. 
On June 16, 2023, Plaintiff served unverified responses.  To date, Plaintiff has not provided
verifications.  Accordingly, Defendant is
entitled to an order compelling Plaintiff to provide verifications for his
responses to the Form Interrogatories (General and Employment). 
C.    
Monetary Sanctions
Defendant requests sanctions
against Plaintiff.  Given that the court
has granted these motions, sanctions are warranted.  Accordingly, sanctions are imposed against
Plaintiff in the sum of $1,480, consisting of two hours at defense counsel’s hourly
rate and $180 in filing fees.
IV.       CONCLUSION
            The
motions are GRANTED.  Plaintiff is
ordered to provide verifications for his responses to Defendant’s Requests for
Production of Documents, Set One, Form Interrogatories (General) and Form
Interrogatories (Employment).  Plaintiff
is also ordered to produce documents consistent with his unverified statements
of compliance to Requests for Production, Nos. 13, 14, 18,19, 25, and 28-30.  
            The request
for sanctions is GRANTED.  Plaintiff is
ordered to pay monetary sanctions to Defendant, by and through its counsel, in
the sum of $1,480.
            
 
Verifications must be provided, documents must be produced,
and monetary sanctions must be paid within 30 days of this order.
Moving party to give
notice.
