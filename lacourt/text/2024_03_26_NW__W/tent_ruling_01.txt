BACKGROUND
 
This is a habitability action. Plaintiff
alleges he was a resident and tenant of a certain property located in Sherman
Oaks and defendants Mohammad Moayery and Parvaneh Moshir Afshar are the owners.
Plaintiff alleges the habitability violations include mold. Plaintiff contends
as a result of the toxic mold, plaintiff became ill and incurred substantial
medical damages. 
 
On May 3, 2021, Plaintiff filed a first
amended complaint asserting causes of action for negligence and intentional
infliction of emotional distress. 
 
On August 3, 2021, the Court sustained
Defendants’ demurrer to the FAC without leave to amend. Plaintiff appealed. The
Court of Appeal affirmed the decision. Defendant now seeks attorney fees on
appeal. 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Defendant Mohammad Moayery’s Motion for Attorney Fees is GRANTED. 
 
discussion
 
Defendant Mohammad Moayery moves for an order awarding him
attorney fees on appeal against Plaintiff Mike Davidyan. Defendant makes the
motion on the grounds Defendant prevailed on appeal. 
 
“The right to recover costs on appeal is governed by California
Rules of Court, rule 8.278 (rule 8.278).”  (Musaelian v. Adams¿(2011)
197 Cal.App.4th 1251, 1259.)   “Rule 8.278(a) provides in part:
‘(1) Except as provided in this rule, the party prevailing in the Court of
Appeal in a civil case other than a juvenile case is entitled to costs on
appeal. [¶] ... [¶] (5) In the interests of justice, the Court of Appeal may
also award or deny costs as it deems proper.’ The right to recover costs
depends on four conditions: ‘(1) There must be a valid judgment awarding costs
to the party claiming them; (2) the item must be one allowed by rule or
statute; (3) the amount claimed must have been actually incurred; (4) the
amount claimed must be reasonable.’”  (Ibid.)  Additionally,
“[u]nless the court orders otherwise, an award of costs neither includes
attorney's fees on appeal nor precludes a party from seeking them under rule
3.1702.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, 8.278(d)(2).) 
 
Defendant seeks $7,065.00 in costs for having to defend both the
underlying judgment and the award of attorneys’ fees. First, the court
notes Defendant prevailed on appeal and was entitled to recover costs. (See Remittitur
01/02/2024.) Next, utilizing a lodestar approach and in view of the totality of
the circumstances, the court agrees $7,065.00 is reasonable amount of
attorney’s fees incurred on appeal. 
 
The motion is unopposed. Based on the foregoing, Defendant’s
Motion for Attorney Fees is GRANTED.
