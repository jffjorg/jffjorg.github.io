And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer to the first amended complaint by Ford Motor Company, the defendant. The demurrer was filed against the third cause of action (Violation of Civil Code section 1793.2(a)(3)) and the fifth cause of action (Fraudulent Inducement - Concealment).

The Judge has sustained the demurrer to the third cause of action, finding that the allegations are still insufficient to support a claim under Civil Code section 1793.2(a)(3). The Judge has also overruled the demurrer to the fifth cause of action, finding that the allegations are sufficient to support a claim of fraudulent concealment.

The Judge's ruling is based on the allegations in the first amended complaint, which include claims that Ford Motor Company knew about the transmission defect in the 2022 Ford F150 and concealed it from the plaintiff. The Judge has found that the plaintiff's allegations are sufficient to support a claim of fraudulent concealment, but that the allegations are still insufficient to support a claim under Civil Code section 1793.2(a)(3).
