PRODUCTION – SET ONE and ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO COMPEL SPECIAL
INTERROGATORIES – SET ONE and FORM INTERROGATIORES – SET ONE with MONETARY
SANCTIONSI.               
INTRODUCTION
This is a conversion complaint that arises out of a dispute between
Plaintiff Lotus Gallery, Inc. ("Plaintiff") and Defendant Edna
Minassian ("Defendant") regarding Defendant's alleged retention of an
overpayment of $38,000 from a transaction involving the purchase of a luxury
watch. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant knowingly retained the excess payment
and refused to return it despite multiple demands.
On March 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant action, alleging causes of
action for (1) Conversion, (2) Violation of Penal Code section 496(c), and (3)
Unjust Enrichment.
On November 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed four discovery motions: (1) a
motion to deem Requests for Admissions - Set One admitted, (2) a motion to
compel responses to Requests for Production - Set One, (3) a motion to compel
responses to Form Interrogatories - Set One, and (4) a motion to compel
responses to Special Interrogatories - Set One. On December 2, 2024, Defendant
filed oppositions addressing each of the motions, and on December 9, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a reply.
The Court has consolidated these four motions and will address each in
the following tentative ruling.
            II.        REQUESTS
FOR ADMISSIONS & REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION
Request for
admission (RFA) – Set One
“Any party may obtain discovery . . . by a written request that any other
party to the action admit the genuineness of specified documents, or the truth
of specified matters of fact, opinion relating to fact, or application of law
to fact. A request for admission may relate to a matter that is in controversy
between the parties.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.010.)¿ “Within 30 days after
service of requests for admission, the party to whom the requests are directed
shall serve the original of the response to them on the requesting party, and a
copy of the response on all other parties who have appeared . . . .”¿ (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.250(a).)  
If a party to whom request for admissions are served fails to provide a
timely response, the party to whom the request was directed waives any
objections, including based on privilege or the work product doctrine. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(a).) The requesting party can move for an order that the
genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
request be deemed admitted, as well as for monetary sanctions. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280(b).) The court shall issue this order unless the party to
whom the request was made serves a response in substantial compliance prior to
the hearing on the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(c).) 
It is well-settled that “unsworn responses are tantamount to no responses
at all.”  (Appleton v. Superior Court (1888) 206 Cal.App.3d 632,
636; Zorro Inv. Co. v. Great Pacific Securities Corp. (1977) 69
Cal.App.3d 907, 914.)   
Here, Plaintiff served its Requests for Admissions - Set One on Defendant
on September 18, 2024. Responses were initially due by October 18, 2024.
Plaintiff granted an informal extension to November 1, 2024, but Defendant did
not provide responses within the extended period. (Ho Decl., ¶ 4, Exh. B.)
Defendant eventually provided responses on December 2, 2024, contemporaneous
with her opposition to this motion. Plaintiff acknowledges in its reply brief
that Defendant’s responses were provided. (Reply, p. 3)
Given this, Defendant’s late responses render the motion to deem
admissions admitted MOOT. Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280(c) mandates
denial of such motions if responses in substantial compliance are served before
the hearing.
Accordingly, the motion to deem RFAs admitted is DENIED.
Request for
production (RFP) – Set One
A propounding party may move to compel responses to requests for
production of documents where the responding party fails to provide responses.
(CCP § 2031.300.) The responding party must provide responses within thirty
days after the demand is served. (CCP § 2031.030(c)(2) & (3).) The
responding party waives all objections, including privilege and work product,
by failing to timely respond to requests for production of documents. (CCP §
2031.300.) 
Plaintiff served Requests for Production of Documents (Set One) on
September 18, 2024. Responses were initially due by October 18, 2024. Defendant
failed to provide any responses within the deadline and did not seek an
extension. Plaintiff filed this motion to compel on November 18, 2024, after
further attempts to secure responses were unsuccessful. (Ho Decl., ¶¶ 3–4¿.)
On December 2, 2024, Defendant served responses to the RFPs concurrently
with her opposition to this motion. Plaintiff acknowledges receipt of these
responses but argues they are incomplete and maintain that sanctions are
warranted for Defendant’s delay. (Reply, p. 3¿)
As responses have been served, albeit late, the motion to compel is
rendered MOOT. Any disputes regarding the sufficiency of responses must be
addressed through a separate motion to compel further responses under Code of
Civil Procedure section 2031.310.
Accordingly, the motion to compel RFP responses is DENIED.
III.  INTERROGATORIES – Form Interrogatories– Set
One and Special Interrogatories – Set One
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290(a), if a party fails to
respond to interrogatories, they waive any objections, including those based on
privilege or work product protection. When a party does not provide timely
responses, the propounding party is entitled to move for an order compelling
responses. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290(b), the Court
must order the responding party to provide responses without objections.
Plaintiff served Form Interrogatories - Set One and Special
Interrogatories - Set One on Defendant on September 18, 2024. Responses were
due by October 18, 2024, but Defendant failed to provide responses or request
an extension. Plaintiff filed this motion to compel on November 18, 2024. (Ho
Decl., ¶ 3¿)
As of the hearing date, Defendant has not served any responses to the
Form Interrogatories or Special Interrogatories. Defendant argues in her
opposition that she requires additional time to prepare responses following the
substitution of her attorney on November 21, 2024, citing her medical condition
and the need for counsel to familiarize herself with the case. (Opposition, pp.
2–3¿)
While Defendant’s circumstances provide context for her delay, they do
not excuse her statutory obligations to respond to discovery. As no responses
have been served, Plaintiff’s motions to compel responses to the Form
Interrogatories and Special Interrogatories are GRANTED.
 
V.        SANCTIONS
Sanctions are mandatory under the California Code of Civil Procedure when
a party’s failure to respond to discovery necessitates a motion, regardless of
whether responses are eventually served, or the motions are resolved as moot.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.030(a), 2030.290(c), 2033.280(c).) Plaintiff seeks
$3,521.50 in sanctions for the four motions, including $844.50 for the motion
to deem Requests for Admissions admitted, $930 for the motion to compel
responses to Requests for Production, and $873 each for the motions to compel
responses to Form Interrogatories and Special Interrogatories. Plaintiff
contends that these sanctions reflect time spent preparing the motions and
anticipated hearing attendance. Specifically, Plaintiff declares that the
motions were prepared by a paralegal with over 30 years of experience, billed
at a rate of $285 per hour. (Ho Decl., ¶ 3¿)
Defendant opposes sanctions, citing her significant medical challenges,
specifically a brain tumor impairing her vision, and the recent substitution of
counsel on November 21, 2024, as substantial justification for her failure to
timely respond. (Minassian Decl., ¶¶ 2–6; Opposition, p. 4¿) While these
circumstances provide context for the delay, they do not excuse Defendant’s
statutory obligations to respond to discovery or negate the mandatory nature of
sanctions when motions are necessitated by noncompliance.
The court finds Plaintiff’s requested sanctions excessive, considering
the straightforward nature of the motions and the reasonable amount of effort
required. Accordingly, the court consolidates sanctions for all four motions
and awards sanctions for three hours of work at the paralegal rate—two hours
for preparation and one hour for hearing attendance—at $285 per hour. The court
further acknowledges that the paralegal’s extensive experience, as noted in
Plaintiff’s declaration, justifies this rate. (Ho Decl., ¶ 4.)
The total monetary sanctions are therefore reduced to $855. The Court
GRANTS Plaintiff monetary sanctions in the amount of $855.
VI.       CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s
motions to deem Requests for Admission - Set One, admitted and to compel
responses Requests for Production- Set One as moot.
 The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motions to compel
responses to Special Interrogatories – Set One and Form Interrogatories – Set
One. The Court GRANTS monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of
$855.  
Defendant is ordered to provide
responses and pay sanctions within 20 days of this order.
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice.
