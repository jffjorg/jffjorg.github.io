And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by the plaintiff to set aside or vacate judgments entered on September 5, 2024. The plaintiff had filed notices of appeal as to the July 30, 2024 summary judgment orders on September 19, 2024. The judge has ruled that the notices of appeal have perfected the appeal and stayed the proceedings in the trial court with respect to the judgments. As a result, the court lacks jurisdiction to consider the plaintiff's motion to set aside the judgments.
