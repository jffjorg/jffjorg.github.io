And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel compliance with a deposition subpoena served on Charter Communications. The plaintiffs, Darren Frydendall and Shannon Smith, are seeking to identify the Doe Defendants who have allegedly been contacting them through email since 2020 with racial epithets and harassing messages. The plaintiffs claim that they do not know the identity of the Doe Defendants and need the information to proceed with their lawsuit.

The judge notes that the plaintiffs are not in compliance with California Code of Civil Procedure Section 2025.210, which requires a 20-day "hold" before serving a deposition notice. However, the judge finds that this noncompliance is inconsequential given the circumstances.

The judge also finds that the plaintiffs' motion is denied without prejudice because the motion was not personally served on Charter Communications. The judge suggests that the plaintiffs may renew their motion, and any briefing on the merits should address the requirements established in Krinsky v. Doe 6 (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 1154 and Glassdoor, Inc. v. Superior Court (2017) 9 Cal.App.5th 623.

The judge orders the plaintiffs to give notice to Charter Communications and denies the motion to compel compliance without prejudice.
