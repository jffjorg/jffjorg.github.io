And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for terminating sanctions brought by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Defendant) against Alex Avi (Plaintiff). The Plaintiff was injured in a bus accident and brought a lawsuit against the Defendant, alleging that the Defendant's employee operated the bus negligently.

The Defendant argues that the Plaintiff failed to comply with a court order compelling Plaintiff's responses to Defendant's discovery demands and has not paid the assessed sanctions of $1,680. The Plaintiff has filed no opposition to the motion, and the judge notes that the Plaintiff is now representing himself in pro per after his former counsel's motion to be relieved was granted.

The judge finds that the evidence does not indicate that the Plaintiff's failure to comply with the court's order was willful, as there is no evidence of informal attempts by the Defendant to resolve the matter or any declaration from the Defendant's counsel stating that the Plaintiff's noncompliance was willful. The judge also finds that less severe sanctions would likely be effective in obtaining the Plaintiff's compliance.

As a result, the judge continues the motion for terminating sanctions to December 20, 2024, and orders the Defendant to give notice to the Plaintiff. The judge also orders the Plaintiff to serve the Defendant with any further pleadings or responses.
