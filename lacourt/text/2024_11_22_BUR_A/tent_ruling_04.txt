ALLEGATIONS: 
 
Britecap Financial,
LLC (Plaintiff) brings this action against AGCO Construction, LLC (AGCO) &
Donald J. Aquillard (Aquillard) (collectively Defendants). Plaintiff alleges
that Defendants are indebted to them in the amount of $52,325.97 as Defendants
failed to make payments pursuant to a May 9, 2023 Loan Agreement. Plaintiff
alleges this Loan Agreement was personally guaranteed by Aguillard, who is
listed as on the Agreement as the owner of ACGO. 
 
On April 15, 2024 Aquillard
filed a General Denial in pro per. On October 25, 2024, default was
entered against AGCO.
 
Before the Court is
Plaintiff’s Motion to Deem Matters in their Request for Admissions (RFA)
admitted. Plaintiff states this motion has resulted from Aquillard’s failure to
respond to their RFA demands. Aquillard has not opposed this motion. The Court
notes that, pursuant to C.R.C. Rule 8.54(c), a
failure to oppose a motion may be deemed consent to its being granted.  
 
On
November 8, 2024, this motion came on for hearing. The motion was continued to
November 22, 2024 to allow Plaintiff to correct an inadvertent omission of the
Proof of Service for the underlying discovery demands. Having reviewed
Plaintiff’s supplemental submissions, the Court now issues the following
ruling. 
  
ANALYSIS: 
 
I.                   
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
If a party fails to respond
to requests for admission in a timely manner, the requesting party may move for
an order that the matters be deemed admitted. (C.C.P. § 2033.280(b).) The requesting party’s motion must be
granted by the court unless the party to whom the requests for admission have
been directed has served a proposed response to the requests for admission that
is in substantial compliance with C.C.P. § 2033.220 prior to the hearing. 
(C.C.P. § 2033.280(c).)  By failing
to timely respond, the party to whom the requests are directed waives any
objection to the requests, including one based on privilege or work
product.  (C.C.P. §
2033.280(a).) 
 
II.                
MERITS 
 
Request to Deem RFA Matters
Admitted  
 
On May 8,
2024, Plaintiff served their first set of discovery demands on Aquillard, which
included RFA Set One and Form Interrogatories Set One. (Blanda Decl. ¶ 2.)
The Proof of Service shows the RFA were served via U.S. Mail to 37506 Penara
St., Palmdale, CA 93552. (See Proof of Service filed Nov. 7, 2024.) This is the
same address listed on Aquillard’s Answer. Plaintiff states Aquillard has not
responded to the demands. (Blande Decl. ¶ 4.) Plaintiff’s June 19, 2024
letter regarding the outstanding RFA also received no response. (Blande Decl.
¶ 5, Exh. 2.) 
 
Given the
foregoing, Plaintiff’s unopposed Motion to Deem RFA Matters Admitted is
GRANTED. 
 
Sanctions

 
The Court
elects to not assess sanctions against Aguillar as Plaintiff has not requested
them in connection with this motion.
