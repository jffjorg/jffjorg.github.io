And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions by the Plaintiff, Mido Khalil, to compel responses to discovery requests and deem matters in his Request for Admissions (RFA) admitted. The Plaintiff brought these motions against Ivan Koumaev and Matt Aylward, who are defendants in the case.

The Court has found that the motions to compel responses to discovery requests are moot since Koumaev and Aylward have now served responses to the Plaintiff's discovery demands. The Court has also found that the motions to deem RFA matters admitted are moot since Koumaev and Aylward have now served responses to the RFA.

However, the Court has granted sanctions against Koumaev and Aylward for their failure to timely respond to discovery requests. The Court has awarded sanctions in the amount of $1,220 to the Plaintiff and $610 to each of Koumaev and Aylward. The Court has also ordered that the sanctions be paid within 30 days.

The Court's ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure (C.C.P.) sections 2030.290, 2031.300, and 2033.280, which govern the discovery process and the imposition of sanctions for failure to comply with discovery requests. The Court has also considered the Declarations of Koumaev and Aylward, which explain the circumstances behind their non-response to discovery requests.
