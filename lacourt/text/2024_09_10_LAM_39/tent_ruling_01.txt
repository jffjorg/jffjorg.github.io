Motion to Compel Further Discovery Responses

MOTION
            On
June 17, 2024, Plaintiff Lisa Carson (“Plaintiff”) filed this motion to compel Defendant
FCA US, Inc. (“Defendant”) to further respond to her Requests for Production of
Documents, set one (“RPD”), Nos. 16-21. 
Defendant has not filed an opposition to the motion.  
ANALYSIS
If the propounding
party deems responses to requests for production of documents unsatisfactory,
the propounding party may move to compel further responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310.)  
Plaintiff alleges her
2021 Jeep Grand Cherokee vehicle had defects Defendant was unable to repair
within a reasonable number of attempts.  Plaintiff,
therefore, contends Defendant is liable under the Song-Beverly Consumer
Warranty Act.  She complains Defendant
asserted boilerplate objections in response to the RPD at issue.  However, on August 9, 2024, it appears Defendant
further responded to the RPD by providing a link toa supplemental document
production, thereby “leaving nothing to address in a motion to compel.”  (American Federation of State, County &
Municipal Employees v. Metropolitan Water Dist. (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 247,
269.).  (See Defendant’s Memorandum of
Points and Authorities in Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Compliance
With the Court’s March 14, 2024, Discovery Order, Exhibit G.)  Because Defendant responded to the RPD, the
Court will not compel a further response on the basis Defendant also asserted
objections.
It appears Plaintiff
moves to compel Defendant to further respond to RPD No. 16 because Plaintiff does
not believe Defendant’s response.  But, Plaintiff
cannot move to compel Defendant to further respond solely on the basis Plaintiff
believes Defendant’s response is untrue.  (Holguin v. Superior Court (1972) 22
Cal.App.3d 812, 820-821.)  Plaintiff’s
remedy is to offer Defendant’s allegedly incomplete response as an admission or
as a prior inconsistent statement to impeach Defendant at trial, if Defendant
seeks to introduce evidence it did not disclose in discovery. (Evid. Code, §§
1220; 1235.)
With respect to
RPD Nos. 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21, as noted above, Defendant states it has produced
responsive documents.[1]  If Defendant has, in fact, not done so,
Plaintiff’s remedy is to move to compel Defendant’s compliance with its
agreement to do so.  No further response
is required.  Accordingly, the motion to
compel further responses is denied. 
Plaintiff is ordered
to give notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
