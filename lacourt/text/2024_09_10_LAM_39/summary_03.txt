And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is in response to a motion filed by Defendant Minh Thuy Co Hoang to enjoin the cross-complaint of Cross-Complainants Trong B. Nguyen, M.D., Inc., and Rejuvenate Surgical Center, LLC. The motion is granted, and the cross-complaint is restrained and stayed pending determination of the interpleader complaint filed by Plaintiff Law Office of London & Le. The Court finds that the cross-complaint is duplicative of the interpleader action and that the Defendant is entitled to an order under Code of Civil Procedure section 386, subdivision (f) to restrain other proceedings that would impact the interpleader action. The Court also notes that a defendant in an interpleader action cannot, by cross-complaint, change the character of the action by setting up a new and distinct claim against the plaintiff.
