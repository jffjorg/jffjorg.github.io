And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to grant the plaintiff's motion to continue the trial. The trial was originally set for January 22, 2025, but the plaintiff's trial counsel is unavailable. The parties have stipulated to a continuance, and the judge has found good cause for the continuance based on the unavailability of the trial counsel. The trial is continued to a date on or after June 2, 2025, and all discovery deadlines are reset accordingly. The final status conference and all discovery deadlines are reset based on the new trial date.
