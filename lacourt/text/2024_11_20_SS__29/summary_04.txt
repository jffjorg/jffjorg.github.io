Significant Statements:
  - "The purpose of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties' pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute."
  - "A settlement agreement is a contract, and a contract is generally formed by an offer and an acceptance."
  - "If there was any material variance from these conditions in the response of Liggins, then the response was not an acceptance but rather a counteroffer or invitation to deal."
  - "Equitable estoppel is a doctrine that prevents a party from denying the existence of a valid and enforceable agreement when that party has led the other party to reasonably believe that the agreement was in place."
