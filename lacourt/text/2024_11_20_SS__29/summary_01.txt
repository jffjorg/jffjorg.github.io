And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendants' motion for leave to conduct a second physical examination of the plaintiff, Julie Taylor. The defendants had requested a second examination by neurologist Kenneth L. Nudelman, M.D. to determine the necessity of a second examination. However, the judge found that the defendants' motion did not comply with the procedural requirements of the California Code of Civil Procedure, specifically section 2032.310, which requires the motion to specify the manner, conditions, scope, and nature of the examination. The judge also found that the defendants' proposed scope of examination was too broad and open-ended, and did not provide sufficient details about the diagnostic tests and procedures that would be conducted. Therefore, the judge denied the motion, concluding that the defendants had not shown good cause for the second physical examination.
