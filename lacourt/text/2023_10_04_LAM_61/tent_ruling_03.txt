I.                  
MOTION TO
COMPEL
A propounding party may demand a responding
party to produce documents that are in their possession, custody or control.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.010.) A party may likewise conduct discovery by
propounding interrogatories to another party to be answered under oath. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2030.010, subd. (a).) The responding party must respond to the
production demand either by complying, by representing that the party lacks the
ability to comply, or by objecting to the demand. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.210.) The responding party must respond to the interrogatories by
answering or objecting. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.210, subd. (a).) If the
responding party fails to serve timely responses, the propounding party may
move for an order compelling responses to the production demand and
interrogatories. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.) 
 
This
court on June 8, 2023, granted Plaintiff Immigrant Rights Defense Council,
LLC’s (Plaintiff) motion to compel responses to requests for production from
Defendant Jo Bog Yoo (Defendant). However, as of the date of the filing of the
present motion on September 7, 2023, no responses have been served, despite
Plaintiff’s efforts to meet and confer. (Medvei Decl. ¶¶ 6–8.) 
Defendant
in response contends that he served his response on July 21, 2023, but received
a notice of non-delivery in early August. (Response at p. 1.) 
Defendant’s
response in opposition is not convincing. The July 21, 2023 letter that
Defendant claims was not delivered is included as an exhibit to Plaintiff’s
motion. The letter does not contain any responses to the requests for
production at issue in this motion, and Defendant does not contend in
opposition that it did. Rather, Defendant’s letter misconstrued Plaintiff’s
meet-and-confer correspondence as seeking further responses to requests for admission,
when the letter sought further responses to requests for production of
documents. No such responses have been deliverd.
The
motion to compel compliance is therefore GRANTED, and Defendant is once again
directed to provide responses to requests for production within 30 days.
Plaintiff’s request for terminating sanctions is DENIED, as Defendant has not
yet presented a pattern of willful noncompliance that would justify entering
his default. (See Van Sickle v.
Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.) Plaintiff is entitled to
monetary sanctions, however, and Defendant is warned that further
non-compliance with this court’s orders and his discovery obligations will
warrant more severe sanctions.
Plaintiff
seeks $3,060.00 in sanctions, representing six hours of attorney work at $500
per hour, plus a $60 filing fee. (Medvei Decl. ¶ 8.)
Monetary
sanctions are awarded against Defendant in the amount of $1,560. 
Plaintiff to provide notice.
