And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to compel compliance with the June 8, 2023 order, requiring the defendant, Jo Bog Yoo, to provide responses to the plaintiff's requests for production within 30 days. The defendant had failed to provide responses despite the court's order and the plaintiff's efforts to meet and confer. The judge awarded monetary sanctions against the defendant in the amount of $1,560. The judge denied the plaintiff's request for terminating sanctions, finding that the defendant had not yet presented a pattern of willful noncompliance. However, the judge warned the defendant that further non-compliance with court orders and discovery obligations would warrant more severe sanctions.
