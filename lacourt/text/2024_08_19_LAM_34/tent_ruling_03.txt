[1]            The motion was filed (and
electronically served) on May 6, 2024, and originally set for hearing on December
23, 2024. On May 14, 2024, a “Notice of Rescheduled Hearing Date Re: Defendants’
Motion to Compel Arbitration” was filed, wherein the December 23, 2024 hearing
was continued to June 7, 2024; notice was given to counsel. On June 3, 2024,
the court continued the hearing to July 18, 2024; the court provided notice. On
July 5, 2024, the court continued the hearing to August 19, 2024; the court
provided notice.


[2]            Because the court’s denial is based
on Defendants’ failure to meet its burden of establishing the existence of a
valid arbitration, the court will not address Plaintiff’s alternative argument
that the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act,
9 U.S.C. §402, mandates a denial as well.
