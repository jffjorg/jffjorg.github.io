However, the hearing has been continued several times due to various requests by the parties. The judge has determined that the defendants have failed to meet their burden of establishing the existence of a valid arbitration agreement. As a result, the judge will deny the motion. The judge will not address an alternative argument raised by the plaintiff, which is based on the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act.
