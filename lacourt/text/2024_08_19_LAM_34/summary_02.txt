Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion by MeUndies, Inc. and Jonathan Shokrian to compel arbitration and stay court action in this employment dispute. The dispute concerns allegations of harassment and discrimination by MeUndies, Inc. against plaintiff Meghan Hidalgo during her employment from February 2020 to February 2023. The defendants argue that Hidalgo signed an electronic Mutual Arbitration Agreement (MAA) when she was hired, which requires disputes to be resolved through arbitration rather than court litigation. However, Hidalgo disputes the existence of the MAA and denies signing it.

The judge finds that the defendants have not met their burden to prove the existence of a valid arbitration agreement, citing a lack of sufficient evidence to authenticate the electronic signature. The judge also notes that the defendants did not present sufficient evidence to establish that Hidalgo knowingly signed the MAA or was aware of its terms. As a result, the motion to compel arbitration and stay court action is denied.
