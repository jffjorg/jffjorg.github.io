 Case Number:  24NWCP00065    Hearing Date:   March 22, 2024    Dept:  C ALFREDO ASIDE, LLC vs D. O., Case No.
24NWCP00065
Respondent Alfredo Aside, LLC applies ex parte to Advance
the Hearing on Petition for Approval for Transfer of Structure Settlement
Payment Rights. 
A party may seek ex parte relief upon an affirmative
factual showing "irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other
statutory basis for granting relief ex parte." (Cal. R. Ct. 3.1202(c).) 
In the Declaration of Counsel Juan C. Lozano, Counsel
states that D.O. seeks to advance the hearing because D.O. is “in desperate
need of funding so that they can pay a legal bill for a family matter involving
the safety of a minor child, where time is absolutely of the essence. In sum,
the Payee’s family will face major upheaval, if not ruin, if the hearing date
is not advanced to an earlier date.” (Lozano Decl., ¶ 5.) 
The hearing is currently set on Wednesday, November 6,
2024. Taken the facts in the declaration as true, the Court is persuaded that
Respondent D.O. would face irreparable harm or immediate danger if the Court
does not advance the hearing. 
Accordingly, the Court ADVANCES the hearing from
Wednesday, November 6, 2024 to this date and CONTINUES the hearing to Wednesday,
May 8, 2024 at 10:30 a.m. in Department SE-C. 
Petitioner to give notice.
