Here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Philadelphia's motion to continue the trial from March 26, 2024 to April 10, 2024, with the maximum period allowed by law. The judge also grants Platinum's motion to compel the deposition of Ani Khachikyan, but only for the limited purpose of inquiring about Plaintiff Leah Kesablyan's claimed neurological injuries and treatment.

The judge denies Platinum's motion to compel the deposition of Kirakos Kesablyan, as he has been evading service of Deposition Subpoenas and has not been personally served. The judge also denies both parties' requests for sanctions, as no abuse of the discovery process has been found.

The judge notes that Ani Khachikyan has previously been deposed for seven hours and that Kirakos Kesablyan has been evading service of Deposition Subpoenas. The judge also references several California statutes and case law, including CCP § 36, CCP § 2025.610, and CCP § 128(a).
