[1] In reply, Plaintiff also argues
that VLV Builders is not a licensed contractor as its CSLB license history
shows that VLV Builders claims to be exempt from workers compensation
coverage.  (Reply at Ex. A.)  The exemption applies where the contractor
has no employees and does not hold a certain type of license.  (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 7125(b).)  However, if accepting the photographs
submitted with the opposition brief, Plaintiff argues that VLV Builders appears
to have employees working on the jobsite.
