 [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
motion to lift stay  



 
BACKGROUND 
A.   
Allegations
Plaintiff Mariam Avanessian (“Plaintiff”)
alleges that she was born on July 3, 1952, such that she is 71 years old and an
“elder” pursuant to the Welfare & Institutions Code.  Plaintiff alleges that Defendants Alameda
Care Center, Artesia Healthcare, Inc. dba Alameda Care Center, and Longwood
Management, LLC were the owners, operators, and managers of Alameda Care Center
and were acting as “care custodians” during Plaintiff’s admission to Alameda
Care Center.  Plaintiff alleges that she
was totally dependent upon Defendants for food, shelter, medical treatment,
physical hygiene, and assistance with all activities of daily living, but
Defendants failed to operate and provide services in compliance with federal
and state regulations, failed to protect her from health hazards, neglected and
abused her, and failed to provide for her physical and mental health
needs.  
Plaintiff alleges that on April 27, 2022,
her son Allen received a call from the nursing staff to inform him that
Plaintiff had fallen during the night, injuring her right leg.  Plaintiff alleges that Alameda Care Center
took an x-ray and diagnosed her with a fracture of an “unspecified part of neck
of left femur” (Compl., ¶22) and that she was prevented from receiving
necessary, timely medical care as she was not taken to Glendale Adventist Hospital
until April 28, 2022.  On April 29, 2022,
Plaintiff underwent a partial hip replacement surgery to repair the fracture
and was discharged on May 9, 2022 and readmitted to Alameda Care Center.  Although Defendants knew of Plaintiff’s
condition and that she was a fall risk, Plaintiff alleges that she fell and
complained of pain on April 3, 2023, was again found on the floor of her bed on
April 8, 2023, fell again on June 15, 2023, was found to have scabies and
rashes all over her body on October 12, 2023, fell again on November 11, 2023
while unattended on a walk, and fell again on November 28, 2023 while on a
walk.  
            The complaint, filed on January 16,
2024, alleges causes of action for: (1) elder abuse (Welfare & Institutions
Code, § 15600 et seq.); (2) negligence; (3) violation of Health &
Safety Code, § 1430(b); and (4) willful misconduct.  
B.    
Relevant Background
On February 29, 2024, Defendants Artesia
Healthcare, Inc. dba Alameda Care Center and Longwood Management, LLC filed a
motion to compel arbitration.  On March
28, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion for trial preference pursuant to CCP § 36(a)
and (e).  The Court held a hearing on the
two motions on May 3, 2024, and took the matters under submission.  
On May 8, 2024, the Court granted the
motion to compel arbitration for the periods of Plaintiff’s admission from
March 29, 2022 to October 31, 2023 at the facility. The Court granted Defendants’
request for a stay of the action pending the resolution of the arbitration
(including claims following October 31, 2023 after Plaintiff was transferred
from the facility to a hospital, until December 29, 2023 when she was
transferred to a different care facility). 
The Court set an Arbitration Status Conference for November 6,
2024.  The Court took Plaintiff’s motion
for trial preference off-calendar as moot. 
The Court stated that once the arbitration was complete, the Court would
reexamine the need to prioritize the trial of any remaining claims.  
On July 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed a second
motion for trial preference.  On August
16, 2024, the Court denied the motion, stating that the action was stayed pending the resolution of the
arbitration and allowing Plaintiff to
move for trial preference following the conclusion of the arbitration
proceedings, or after further meet and confer and a motion to lift the stay. 
On
September 24, 2024, Judge Frank Tavelman denied Plaintiff’s ex parte
application for an order lifting the stay and ordered the parties to meet and
confer.  
C.    
Motion on Calendar 
On October 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
motion to lift the stay following the Court’s order to compel portions of the
case to arbitration.    
On October 14, 2024, Defendants filed an
opposition brief.  
On October 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
reply brief. 
DISCUSSION 
            Plaintiff
moves for an order lifting the stay pursuant to CCP § 1281.4, which allows a
stay to be lifted after arbitration is complete or “until such earlier time as
the court specifies.”  Plaintiff argues
that the arbitration is not necessary because Plaintiff asserts that damages
are being sought for events after the arbitration cut-off date of October 31,
2023.  
            In
the Court’s prior August 16, 2024 written order on Plaintiff’s second motion
for trial preference, the Court noted that Plaintiff’s reply brief indicated
that she were not seeking any damages for injuries before October 31, 2023,
such that the arbitration was unnecessary. 
The Court ordered the parties to meet and confer regarding whether the
arbitration was necessary and to stipulate to whether Plaintiff would be
pursuing any claims of damages prior to October 31, 2023 and whether in light
of the stipulation the stay should be lifted. 

            Following
the Court’s August 16, 2024 order, the parties attempted to meet and confer
about the stipulation.  Defendants
proposed that Plaintiff be precluded from making/introducing any arguments or
evidence at trial with respect to the acts or omissions of Defendants or is
employees/agents prior to October 31, 2023, but Plaintiff countered that while
not seeking damages prior to October 31, 2023, she still intends to offer
evidence of falls pre-October 31, 2023 and Defendants’ knowledge of the falls
for the purposes of notice and employer ratification.  Plaintiff argues that evidence of injuries
pre-October 31, 2023 will be used to establish Defendants’ knowledge of falls,
Defendants’ wrongful conduct to keep employees who allowed Plaintiff to fall,
and Defendants’ failure to implement additional interventions or provide
Plaintiff with additional care to minimize the risk of falls occurring in the
future (i.e., her fall after October 31, 2023). 
Plaintiff states that 4 falls occurred prior to October 31, 2023,
including on April 27, 2022, April 2, 2023, April 8, 2023, and June 6,
2023.  (Reply at p.2.)  
            In
opposition, Defendants argue that Plaintiff was ordered to continue meeting and
conferring following an ex parte hearing with Judge Frank Tavelman on September
24, 2024, but Plaintiff failed to do so and instead filed this motion.  Defendants argue that if the stay is lifted,
the order should state that: (1) Plaintiff is waiving her right to pursue any
and all claims based on her residency at Alameda Care Center before October 31,
2023; (2) the case is limited to Plaintiff’s claims based on her residency at
Alameda Care Center from October 31, 2023 until her discharge on December 29,
2023; and (3) Plaintiff is precluded from making any arguments and/or
introducing any evidence at trial with respect to any alleged acts or omissions
of Defendants (or their employees or agents) with respect to the care and/or
treatment provided (or not provided) to Plaintiff at Alameda Care Center prior
to October 31, 2023.  Defendants argue
that while Plaintiff has not objected to the first two items, the parties
disagree about the third provision.  
In order
to prove a claim for elder abuse against an employer, Plaintiff must establish
the element of ratification.  Further, pursuant to Welfare & Institutions Code, § 15657(c), “[t]he
standards set forth in subdivision (b) of Section 3294 of the Civil Code
regarding the imposition of punitive damages on an employer based upon the acts
of an employee shall be satisfied before any damages or attorney's fees
permitted under this section may be imposed against an employer.”  Civil Code, § 3294(b) states: “An employer shall
not be liable for damages pursuant to subdivision (a), based upon acts of an
employee of the employer, unless the employer had advance knowledge of the
unfitness of the employee and employed him or her with a conscious disregard of
the rights or safety of others or authorized or ratified the wrongful conduct
for which the damages are awarded or was personally guilty of oppression,
fraud, or malice. With respect to a corporate employer, the
advance knowledge and conscious disregard, authorization, ratification or act
of oppression, fraud, or malice must be on the part of an officer, director, or
managing agent of the corporation.”  
The parties
acknowledge that Plaintiff is not seeking any damages for any acts or omissions
that occurred prior to October 31, 2023, and that she is seeking damages solely
for acts or omissions that occurred from the time period between October 31,
2023 to December 29, 2023.  Plaintiff
states that she only intends to introduce arguments and evidence regarding
conduct that occurred prior to October 31, 2023 for the purposes of
establishing employer ratification for her elder abuse claim.  
In the
Court’s view, if Plaintiff is producing evidence of acts or omissions prior to
October 31, 2023, then she is not truly waiving those claims. Even if such
information is produced as background information, it is impossible for the
jury to make the distinction between pre-October 31, 2023 and post-October 2023
liability. Therefore, the Court would be inclined to preclude any evidence that
could tend to attach responsibility for damages that occurred before October
31, 2023 or for acts or omissions that occurred before that date. This includes
the introduction of evidence solely for the purpose of ratification or
knowledge. 
Intending to
impose this strict limitation, the Court finds that Plaintiff will have
completely waived her claims regarding pre-October 31, 2023, and that the trial
can proceed as to events and acts and omissions afterwards. At the time of
trial, the parties may draft appropriate motions in limine and jury
instructions so that the jury is aware of the parameters regarding the
introduction and use of any evidence regarding Defendants’ pre-October 31, 2023
events. 
Based on
these parameters and limitations, the motion to lift the stay is granted.     
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
Plaintiff’s motion
to lift the stay following the Court’s order to compel portions of the case to
arbitration is granted.  The Court enters the following order as the
parties do not dispute that: (1) Plaintiff
is waiving her right to pursue any and all claims based on her residency at
Alameda Care Center before October 31, 2023; and (2) the case is limited to
Plaintiff’s claims based on her residency at Alameda Care Center from October
31, 2023 until her discharge on December 29, 2023.  At the time
closer to trial, the parties may file motions in limine and propose jury
instructions to appropriate limit the scope of the evidence intended to be
introduced at trial.  The Court vacates the Status Conference regarding Arbitration
set on November 6, 2024. The Court sets a Trial Setting Conference for November
6, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. The Court notes defendant have not answered the
complaint. Defendants are ordered to file responsive pleading(s) to the
Complaint before November 6, 2024. 
Plaintiff shall provide notice of this order.
