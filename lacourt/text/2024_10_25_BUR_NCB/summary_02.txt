And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denies Defendant's motion to compel further responses from Plaintiffs Michael Green and Mia Cordes, as the parties have provided supplemental responses. The judge also denies Defendant's motion to compel the attendance of Delia Reed at deposition, but grants the motion to compel Reed's further responses and production of documents. The judge also grants Defendant's motion for a protective order preventing Plaintiff's counsel from coaching Reed during her deposition.

The judge orders Reed to provide further responses and documents in compliance with the deposition notice, and limits the deposition to 1 hour of testimony. The judge also awards attorney's fees to Defendant in the amount of $2,600 and orders Reed to reimburse Defendant for court reporter fees in the amount of $1,854.90.

The judge continues the hearing on Defendant's motion for a protective order preventing Plaintiff Jimmie Henry from appearing at his deposition on a cell phone, while driving and/or working, and from refraining from using profanity and refusing to answer a question based on a self-asserted relevance objection, and from Plaintiff's counsel instructing Henry not to answer questions for reasons other than privilege, to November 8, 2024, so that it can be heard concurrently with Defendant's motion to compel the physical attendance of Jimmie Henry and the production of documents at the deposition of Jimmie Henry.
