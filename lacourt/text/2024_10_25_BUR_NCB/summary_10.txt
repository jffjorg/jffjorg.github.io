And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike paragraph 41 of the first amended complaint, which alleges punitive damages against the defendants. The defendants argue that the allegations are insufficient because they do not provide specific facts showing that the defendants acted with malice, oppression, or fraud. The judge agrees with the defendants and grants the motion to strike with leave to amend. The judge finds that the allegations for punitive damages are general and conclusory and fail to rise to the level of particularity required for a punitive damages claim. The judge orders the defendants to provide notice of this order and grants the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint.
