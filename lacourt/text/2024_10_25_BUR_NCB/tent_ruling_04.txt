  Case No.:  23BBCV02722
 
  Hearing Date:  October 25, 2024
 
[TENTATIVE] order RE:
motion to compel further responses



 
BACKGROUND
A.   
Allegations 
            Plaintiff Tal Lavon (“Mr. Lavon”)
alleges that on August 21, 2023, Defendants AGAM Properties, Inc. (“AGAM”),
Pacifica First National, Inc. (“Pacifica”), Scott Radin (“Mr. Radin”), and
Nathan Agam (“Mr. Agam”) owned, operated, controlled, maintained, designed,
managed, inspected, improved, and repaired the premises at or near 3624 Avenida
Del Sol in Studio City.  He alleges that
Defendants allowed a dangerous condition on the premises, including mold, water
damage, insect/pest infestation, and an unmaintained elevator.  Mr. Lavon alleges that he came into contact
with the dangerous condition when living at the property, such that he
sustained injuries.  
            The complaint, filed November 17,
2023, alleges causes of action for: (1) general negligence; and (2) premises
liability.    
B.     Cross-Complaint
On January 8, 2024,
AGAM filed a cross-complaint against Mr. Lavon for breach of contract.  
C.    
Motions on Calendar
On October 1, 2024, AGAM filed a motion to
compel Mr. Lavon’s further response to Request for Production (“RPD”) No. 5.
The Court is not in receipt of an
opposition brief. 
DISCUSSION 
            AGAM moves to
compel Mr. Lavon’s further response to RPD No. 5.  
            The
Court notes that AGAM filed a “NOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER
RESPONSES TO DEFENDANT’S REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS, SET ONE.”  The document includes the caption page (page
1), the notice of motion (page 2), and the attached Reservation ID pages (pages
3 and 4).  No memorandum of points and
authorities is attached.  There are no
other documents, such as a separate statement or declaration in support of the
motion, and no proof of service is attached to the moving papers. 
            The
Court will continue the hearing on the motion so that AGAM can file a
memorandum of points and authorities and any other supporting documents.  AGAM should also file a proof of service of
the motion papers so that the Court is aware of whether the other parties are
on notice of this motion and have the opportunity to oppose the motion. 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
Defendant AGAM
Properties, Inc.’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s further response to RPD No. 5
is continued to December 6, 2024 at 8:30 a.m., so that Defendant may file a
memorandum of points and authorities, separate statement (or concise outline),
supporting papers, and a proof of service of the motion.  Opposition papers shall be filed and served

2024.
