And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is a summary judgment in favor of the Plaintiff, Jenna Rose Hunter, against the Defendants, Dginger Group LLC and et al. The Plaintiff alleges that she contracted with the Defendants to renovate her property, but the Defendants were not licensed contractors. The Plaintiff paid the Defendants a total of $194,350, and the Plaintiff is seeking to recover that amount as the Defendants were not licensed to perform the work. The Defendants argue that they were not parties to the contract and that the work was performed by a licensed contractor, VLV Builders, Inc. However, the Court finds that the evidence submitted by the Defendants is not sufficient to raise a triable issue of material fact, and therefore grants the motion for summary judgment in favor of the Plaintiff.
