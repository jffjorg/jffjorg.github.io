Significant Statements:
  - "The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) does not include a provision comparable to section 1281.2(c) and therefore requires courts to enforce written arbitration agreements even if there is pending litigation involving a third party that may result in conflicting rulings." (Acquire II, Ltd. v. Colton Real Estate Group (2013))
  - "The Court will order the arbitration to be held between U-Haul and Eisenberg. The Court will expect that the arbitration be concluded within one year and will expect both parties to proceed with deliberate speed to bring it to a conclusion."
