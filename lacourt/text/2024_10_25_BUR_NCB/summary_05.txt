The plaintiffs are seeking to add a survival action to their complaint after Ervand Ovanesyan, one of the original plaintiffs, passed away on May 8, 2024. The judge has found that the amendment is necessary and proper and that the motion complies with the relevant rules and statutes. The judge's discretion to grant the motion is exercised liberally, and the motion is granted. The plaintiffs are ordered to electronically file a separate version of the First Amended Complaint with the court by the hearing date.
