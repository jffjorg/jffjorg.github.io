Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the demurrer to the 3rd cause of action (wrongful death) with 20 days leave to amend. The demurrer was sustained because the complaint fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action against the defendants. The complaint also fails to allege standing for the purposes of a wrongful death cause of action.

The judge also grants the motion to strike the request for punitive damages. The motion was granted because the defendants are a religious corporation and the court lacks jurisdiction to award punitive damages against them. However, the judge allows the plaintiffs to file a motion to amend the complaint to include punitive damages following discovery in this matter.

The judge orders that the defendants shall provide notice of this order.
