  Case Number:  23NWCV02191    Hearing Date:   October 30, 2023    Dept:  C Loan Oak Fund v. Gonzalez
 
Cross-Complainant Jose Gonzalez’s Ex Parte Application for a
Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) against Cross-Defendant Loan Oak Fund, LLC’s
foreclosure sale scheduled for November 8, 2023 is DENIED. Cross-Complainant
has not shown a probability of success on the merits. Cross-Complainant argues
that Loan Agreement provided for a seven percent interest rate and the 27
percent default interest rate was not included. However, the Loan Agreement
attached to the Cross-Complaint provides that “[t]he Loan shall be evidenced by
the following Loan Documents … (ii) Promissory Note ….” (Cross-Complaint, Ex.
1.) The Promissory Note provides that “When this Note becomes due in full,
whether by acceleration, upon an Event of Default … the unpaid principal
balance and costs incurred shall … bear interest until paid at the rate of
TWENTY FOUR percent (24.00%) per annum (the “Default Rate”).” (Cross-Complaint,
Ex. 2.) Additionally, Cross-Complainant has not shown through evidence that
this agreement was unconscionable. Therefore, Cross-Complainant’s TRO is DENIED
without prejudice.
