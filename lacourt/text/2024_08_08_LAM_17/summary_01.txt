And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of Eunice J. Bodak, granting her motion to set aside the entry of default. Bodak argued that she was never actually served with the complaint, despite the Proof of Service indicating personal service on December 13, 2023. The judge found that Bodak was not properly served because she was living with her mother at her mother's residence at the time of alleged service, and not at the location where she was purportedly served. The court has granted Bodak's motion, setting aside the entry of default.
