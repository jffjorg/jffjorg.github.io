  MCCRAW,

 Case No.: 
  23STCV20336
 
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  May 30, 2024



 
Plaintiff Claudette McCraw’s unopposed
motion to quash the subpoenas duces tecum directed to third-parties Arrowhead
Credit Union and Bank of America are denied.

 
Plaintiff Claudette McCraw (“McCraw”) (“Plaintiff”) moves unopposed
to quash subpoenas duces tecum directed to third-parties Arrowhead Credit Union
(“Arrowhead”) and Bank of America (“BOA”) on the grounds that the subpoenas seek
personal information that is protected by Plaintiff’s right to privacy.  (Notice Quash, pgs. 1-2; C.C.P. §§1987.1,
1985.3.)[1]
 
CRC
Violations
CRC,
Rule 3.1345 provides, in part, “any motion involving the content of a discovery
request or the responses to such a request must be accompanied by a separate
statement. The motions that require a separate statement include a motion: . .
. [¶] (5) To compel or to quash the production of documents or tangible things
at a deposition.”  (CRC, Rule
3.1345(a)(5).)
In
lieu of a separate statement, the court may direct the parties to file a
“concise outline” of the discovery demands and responses in dispute.  (CRC, Rule 3.1345(b)(2) [stating no separate
statement needed “[w]hen a court has allowed the moving party to submit—in
place of a separate statement—a concise outline of the discovery request and
each response in dispute”].)
Plaintiff
failed to submit a separate statement with their motions to quash the subpoenas
on Arrowhead and BOA in violation of CRC, Rule 3.1345(a)(5), or request
permission from the Court to instead file a “concise outline” of the discovery
demands and responses in dispute in violation of CRC, Rule 3.1345(b)(2).  However, the Court, in its discretion, will
consider Plaintiff’s motions.
 
Meet
and Confer
A
motion to quash a subpoena for business records must be accompanied by a
declaration showing a “reasonable and good faith attempt at informal resolution
of the dispute” between the party requesting the records and the “consumer” or
“employee” whose records are involved or counsel for such person.  (C.C.P. §§1985.3(g), 1985.6(f)(4).)
Plaintiff’s
counsel failed to submit a meet and confer declaration.  Plaintiff failed to demonstrate a good faith attempt
at informal resolution of the dispute. 
(C.C.P. §§1985.3(g), 1985.6(f)(4).) 
Therefore, the Court will not consider Plaintiff’s motion.
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s unopposed
motion to quash the subpoena duces tecum on Arrowhead and BOA are denied.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s
motions to quash the subpoenas duces tecum on Arrowhead and BOA are denied.  
Moving
Party to give notice.
