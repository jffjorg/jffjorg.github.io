And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the unopposed application of Prosegur Security USA, Inc. and Manual Rojas to admit Carlos J. Burruezo to appear pro hac vice. The application was denied because the defendants failed to submit proof of payment of the $50 fee to the State Bar of California, as required by California Rules of Court, Rule 9.40(e). Although the application was unopposed, the court still required the defendants to comply with the rules of court and pay the fee. The court has denied the application, and the moving party is ordered to give notice.
