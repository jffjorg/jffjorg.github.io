IN THE MATTER OF: STRUCTURED SETTLEMENT
  CAPITAL, LLC         


 Case
  No.:  24STCP00936
 
 
 Hearing Date:  May 30, 2024



 
Petitioner Structured Settlement Capital,
LLC’s first amended petition for approval of transfer of structured settlement
payment rights is denied without prejudice.  
 
Petitioner
Structured Settlement Capital, LLC (“SSC”) (“Petitioner”) petitions this Court
to approve its First Amended Petition (“FAP”) for Approval of Transfer of
Structured Settlement Payment Rights. 
(Amended Notice, pg. 2; Ins. Code §10139.5.) 
Petitioner’s
FAP seeks a court order approving a transfer of structured settlement payment
rights under which Payment Obligor, Brighthouse Financial/Brighthouse Life
Insurance Company (“Brighthouse Financial”) (“Payment Obligor”) purchased an annuity
contract issued by and Brighthouse Life Insurance Company (“BLIC”) (“Payment
Issuer”) to fund its obligation to Payee Joel Curiel (“Payee”).  (FAP ¶¶1-2.) 
Payee entered into a transfer agreement (“Transfer Agreement”) to
transfer to Petitioner or its assignee certain structured settlement payments
described in ¶1 of the Transfer Agreement (“Transferred Payments”).  (FAP ¶4, Exh. 2.)
 
Discussion
Copy
of Petition Filed with Attorney General (Ins. Code §10139)
Insurance
Code §10139 requires Petitioner to file a copy of the petition, the disclosure
statement, the transfer agreement, and other documents with the Attorney
General. 
Petitioner’s
Amended Notice attaches a notice of compliance addressed to the Attorney
General verifying, under penalty of perjury, that all provisions of Insurance
Code §§10136, 10137, 10138 have been met relating to the application for
approval of the transfer of the structured settlement payment rights.  (Amended Notice, Exh. A.)   However, Petitioner has not filed a proof of
service for the Petition, and Petitioner’s Amended Notice does not declare that
is complied with Insurance Code §10139.
Therefore,
Petitioner’s FAP is denied without prejudice.

off other debts. On January 22, 2020, Payee’s aforementioned petition with JG
Wentworth under case #19BBCP00435 was dismissed.
(Decl. of Curiel

and financial resources; Payee merely declares that he is retired.  (See Decl. of Curiel ¶5.)   Further, Payee’s declaration regarding his previous
transfers does not include information regarding the reasons for pursuing or
completing previous transactions, except for his last attempt to sell
additional payments, which was dismissed. 
(See Decl. of Curiel ¶12(g).)
          Accordingly,
