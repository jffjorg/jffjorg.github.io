[1] The Court notes Plaintiff moves to quash two
subpoenas. A motion to quash is to be filed as to one subpoena, not multiple
subpoenas.Â  Therefore, Plaintiff owes
this Court an additional $60.00 filing fee for the second motion to quash that
should have been filed in lieu of the instant omnibus motion to quash.
