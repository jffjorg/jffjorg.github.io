And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the City's discovery motion without prejudice. The motion was filed on August 8, 2024, but no opposition was filed. The judge found that the motion did not clearly and concisely state the basis for the motion and the relief sought, as required by law. The motion also improperly combined two sets of inconsistent relief, making it unclear what the City was seeking. The judge suggests that if the City seeks to refile the motion, it should do so separately for each set of discovery for which relief is sought. The judge also notes that Micheal Thomas, the plaintiff, is not authorized to represent his minor son, Chase Thomas, without counsel, and that new counsel for Chase Thomas will need to be retained or the causes of action filed on his behalf will need to be dismissed without prejudice.
