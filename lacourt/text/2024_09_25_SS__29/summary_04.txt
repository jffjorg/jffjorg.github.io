And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion filed by counsel (Armin Abazari, Esq. and Law Offices of Sharona Eslamboly Hakim) to be relieved as counsel for Helen Daisy Moreno (the plaintiff). The motion was filed due to a breakdown of the attorney-client relationship, and counsel has shown due diligence in attempting to determine the plaintiff's current address for proper service. The judge finds that counsel has shown good cause for being relieved based on the breakdown of the attorney-client relationship. The order is effective upon filing with the court a proof of service showing service of the signed order on the clients.
