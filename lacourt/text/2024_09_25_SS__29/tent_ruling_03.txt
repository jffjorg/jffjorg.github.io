Starline Tours of Hollywood
21STCV26485
Defendants’ Demurrer and Motion to Strike
Tentative
The demurrer
is overruled.  The motion to strike is
granted.
Background
On July
19, 2021, Cheryl D. Enlow (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Starline
Tours of Hollywood, Inc. (“Starline”) and Does 1 through 20 for negligence arising
out of an incident on July 26, 2019, in which Plaintiff alleges that she was
injured while attempting to board a tour bus or other tour vehicle. (Complaint,
¶¶ 7-8.)
On April
3, 2023, Starline filed an answer. 
On
February 2, 2024, Plaintiff amended the complaint to name Gaw Capital
Investments, LLC dba Ovation Hollywood (“Gaw”) as Doe 1 and DJM Capital
Partners, Inc. dba Ovation Hollywood (“DJM”) as Doe 2.  Default was entered against Gaw and DJM on
June 21, 2024.
On June
28, 2024, Plaintiff amended the complaint to name CIM Group, L.P. as Doe 3 and CIM
Group Acquisitions, LLC as Doe 4.
On
August 26, 2024, CIM Group, L.P. and CIM Group Acquisitions, LLC (collectively,
the “CIM Defendants”) filed a demurrer and a motion to strike. 
Plaintiff
filed an opposition to the demurrer on September 12.  The CIM Defendants filed a reply on September
18.
Plaintiff
did not file an opposition to the motions to strike.
Legal
Standard
Demurrer
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10 provides:
“The party against whom a complaint or cross-complaint has been
filed may object, by demurrer or answer as provided in Section 430.30, to the
pleading on any one or more of the following grounds:
(a) The court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the
cause of action alleged in the pleading.
(b) The person who filed the pleading does not have the
legal capacity to sue.
(c) There is another action pending between the same
parties on the same cause of action.
(d) There is a defect or misjoinder of parties.
(e) The pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action.
(f) The pleading is uncertain. As used in this subdivision,
“uncertain” includes ambiguous and unintelligible.
(g) In an action founded upon a contract, it cannot be
ascertained from the pleading whether the contract is written, is oral, or is
implied by conduct.
(h) No certificate was filed as required by Section 411.35.”
A
general demurrer for sufficiency under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10,
subdivision (e), tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn
v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
“We treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly
pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.  We also consider matters which may be
judicially noticed.”  (Centinela
Freeman Emergency Medical Associates v. Health Net of California (2016) 1
Cal.5th 994, 1010; Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; accord Yvanova
v. New Century Mortgage Corp. (2016) 62 Cal.4th 919, 924; Marina Pacific
Hotel and Suites v. Fireman’s Fund Insurance Company (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th
96, 104.)
Courts must “liberally construe the pleading” and “give the
complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in
context.”  (Marina Pacific Hotel and
Suites, supra, 81 Cal.App.5th at p. 105.)
A demurrer can be sustained only when it
disposes of an entire cause of action. (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp.
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redev.
Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.)
Leave to amend should be granted when “there is a
reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment.”  (Centinela Freeman, supra, 1 Cal.5th
at p. 1010; Blank, supra, 39 Cal.3d at p. 318; Shaeffer v. Califia
Farms (2020) 44 Cal.App.4th 1125, 1145.)
Motion to Strike
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 435, “Any party, within the
time allowed to respond to a pleading may serve and file a notice of motion to
strike the whole or any part thereof.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 435, subd. (b)(1).)
Code of Civil Procedure section 436 provides as follows:
“The court may, upon a motion
made pursuant to Section 435, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms
it deems proper:
(a) Strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading.
(b) Strike out all or any
part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this
state, a court rule, or an order of the court.”
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 436.)  In ruling on a motion to strike, the court must
assume the truth of the properly pleaded facts in the complaint or other
pleading. (Turman v. Turning Point of Central California, Inc. (2010)
191 Cal.App.4th 53, 63.)
Meet and Confer Requirement
Before filing a demurrer or motion to strike, the parties
must meet and confer.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§
430.41, subd. (a) & 435.5, subd. (a).)
The parties have satisfied the meet and
confer requirements.  (Esmailian Decl., ¶¶
3, 5 & Exhs. A-D.)
Discussion
Demurrer
The complaint
asserts only one cause of action, for negligence, against all of the
defendants.  The CIM Defendants now demur
to Plaintiff’s complaint on essentially three grounds: (1) that the
complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a negligence cause
of action against them; (2) that the complaint is uncertain;
and (3) that the negligence cause of action asserted against them is barred by
the statute of limitations.  The court
considers each of these grounds in turn.
First,
the CIM Defendants argue that the complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action against them. 
The
basic elements of a cause of action for negligence are (1) the existence of a
legal duty; (2) breach of that duty; (3) causation; and (4) resulting
damages. (Brown v. USA Taekwondo (2021) 11 Cal.5th 204, 213.)  
The complaint alleges that
the defendants (including the Doe defendants, of which the CIM Defendants are
two) negligently “maintained, controlled, managed, operated, inspected, and/or
supervised the boarding of passengers on said bus, van, and/or vehicle, as to
fail to prevent foreseeable users, customers and invitees such as Plaintiff,
from being exposed to perilous and unsafe conditions, including, without
limitation, a disorganized, rushed ‘herding’ of passengers toward the waiting
bus, van and/or vehicle.”  (Complaint, ¶
8.)  Plaintiff alleges that all defendants
knew, or should have known, of the danger; that all defendants failed to take
steps to make the condition safe or to warn; and that Plaintiff was injured as
a result.  (Id., ¶¶ 8-15.)  That is a sufficient pleading of a negligence
cause of action against the defendants.
The CIM Defendants argue
that they are no more than property owners and that the complaint does not
allege any nexus between anything that they did, or failed to do, and Plaintiff’s
injuries.  (Mem., at pp. 7-8.)  But that ignores Plaintiff’s allegations in
the complaint.  Those allegations may or
may not have any merit, but the Court must accept the allegations of the
complaint as true for purposes of ruling on a demurrer.  
The demurrer for failure
to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action is overruled.
Second, the CIM Defendants
demur on the grounds of uncertainty.  Demurrers for uncertainty are “disfavored” and will be
sustained “only if the pleading is so incomprehensible that a defendant cannot
reasonably respond.”  (A.J. Fistes
Corp. v. GDL Best Contractors (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 677, 695.)  A complaint need not be “a model of clarity” and
must only contain sufficient allegations to put the defendants on notice of the
claims against them.  (Id.)  As the Court of Appeal has observed, “where a
complaint is in some respects uncertain, … ambiguities can be clarified under
modern discovery procedures.”  (Khoury
v. Maly’s of Cal., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616; see also 1 Weil
& Brown, California Practice Guide: Civ. Proc. Before Trial (The Rutter
Group 2024) ¶¶7:85-7:86.)
Here,
the complaint is not incomprehensible; the CIM Defendants can reasonably
respond.  The demurrer for uncertainty is
overruled.
Third,
the CIM Defendants demur on the ground that the cause of action asserted against
them is barred by the statute of limitations. 
The incident at issue occurred in July 2019, Plaintiff filed suit less
than two years later in July 2021, and the CIM Defendants were named as Doe
defendants in July 2024.  The statute of
limitations for a personal injury action is generally two years.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 335.1.)
The Court begins its analysis
of the statute of limitations issue with Code of Civil Procedure section 474, which
provides, in relevant part:
“When the
plaintiff is ignorant of the name of a defendant, he must state that fact in
the complaint …, and such defendant may be designated in any pleading or
proceeding by any name, and when his true name is discovered, the pleading or
proceeding must be amended accordingly .…”
In general, an amendment to
a pleading to provide the true name of a Doe defendant relates back to the date
the pleading was filed; this allows a plaintiff, effectively, to extend or
enlarge the statute of limitations period.  (Bernson v.
Browning-Ferris Industries (1994) 7 Cal.4th 926, 932.)  For
a Doe amendment to relate back to the date of filing of the original complaint,
however, Plaintiff must have been genuinely ignorant of the defendant’s
identity at the time the original complaint was filed.  (Woo v.
Super. Ct. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 169, 177.)
As the Court of Appeal has
explained, in determining whether a plaintiff is “ignorant of the name of a
defendant” under section 474:
“The test
is whether, at the time the complaint was filed, the plaintiff was ignorant of
the facts giving [her] a cause of against the person.  The focus is on the fact that the plaintiff
knew, not on whether the plaintiff subjectively knew she had a cause of action
based on those facts.  While the
plaintiff’s ignorance must be genuine, and the plaintiff cannot claim ignorance
simply because she did not know all the details of the person’s involvement,
the plaintiff is not barred from invoking section 474 merely because she
suspected the person of wrongdoing based on an incomplete set of facts.”
(Hahn v. New York Air
Brake LLC (2022) 77 Cal.App.5th 895, 899-900 [citations omitted]; see also,
e.g., McClatchy v. Coblentz, Patch, Duffy & Bass, LLP (2016) 247
Cal.App.4th 368, 374 [plaintiff must have “knowledge of sufficient facts to
cause a reasonable person to believe liability is probable”]; General Motors
Corp. v. Super. Ct. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 580, 585 [plaintiff may rely on
section 474 even if he has a “suspicion of wrongdoing” by defendant].) 
The test is actual
ignorance.  For purposes of section 474,
a plaintiff has no “duty to exercise reasonable diligence to obtain facts she
‘should have known.’”  (Hahn, supra,
77 Cal.App.5th at p. 900; accord General Motors, 48 Cal.App.4th at pp.
594-596.)
Section 474 is to be
“liberally construed” in favor of the pleader. 
(General Motors, 48 Cal.App.4th at p. 593 [collecting cases].)
Plaintiff has alleged
actual ignorance in the complaint. 
(Complaint, ¶ 3.)  Although the
CIM Defendants are skeptical about this, the Court must accept that allegation
as true for purposes of ruling on a demurrer. 
The CIM Defendants may, of course, assert the statute of limitations as
an affirmative defense in their answer and may present evidence on this point
to challenge the truth of the allegations in the complaint at a later stage of
these proceedings (including, for example, at trial or on summary judgment).
The demurrer on statute of
limitations grounds is overruled.  
Motion to Strike
The CIM Defendants moves to
strike the prayer for punitive damages, appearing on page 5, line 1, of the
complaint.
To
plead a claim for punitive damages under Civil Code section 3294, a plaintiff
must allege specific facts showing that the defendant
has been guilty of malice, oppression or fraud. (College Hosp., Inc. v.
Super. Ct. (1994) 8 Cal.4th 704, 721; Smith v. Super. Ct. (1992) 10
Cal.App.4th 1033, 1042.) 
“Malice” is defined in section
3294, subdivision (c)(1), as “conduct which is intended by the defendant to
cause injury” or “despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with
a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” 
“Oppression” is defined in
section 3294, subdivision (c)(2), as “despicable conduct subjecting a person to
cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person’s rights.”
“Fraud” is defined in section
3294, subdivision (c)(3), as “an
intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact known
to the defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby
depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.” 
The term “despicable conduct,” as used in subdivisions (c)(1) and
(c)(2), has been defined in the case
law as actions that are “base,” “vile,” or “contemptible.” (See, e.g., College Hospital, supra, 8 Cal.4th at p. 725; Shade Foods, Inc. v. Innovative Products Sales &
Marketing, Inc. (2000) 78 Cal. App. 4th
847, 891; see also CACI 3940 [“Despicable conduct is conduct that is so
vile, base, or contemptible that it would be looked down on and despised by
reasonable people.”].)
The
basis for punitive damages must be pleaded with particularity; conclusory
allegations devoid of any factual assertions are insufficient. (Ibid.;
see also Anschutz Entertainment Group, Inc. v. Snepp (2009) 171
Cal.App.4th 598, 643.) A motion to strike may lie where the facts alleged, if
proven, would not support a finding that the defendant acted with malice, fraud,
or oppression. (Today IV’s Inc. v. Los Angeles County MTA (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th
1137, 1193; Turman, supra, 191 Cal. App. 4th at p. 63.)
Pleading negligence, gross negligence, or even recklessness is not
sufficient. (Dawes v. Super. Ct. (1980) 111 Cal. App. 3d 82, 87.)
Rather, a plaintiff must allege facts demonstrating that the defendant intended
to cause harm to plaintiff or “acted in such an outrageous and reprehensible
manner that the jury could infer that [the defendant] knowingly disregarded the
substantial certainty of injury to others.” (Id. at p. 90; see also,
e.g., American Airlines, Inc. v. Sheppard, Mullin, Richter
& Hampton (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 1017.). 
In the complaint, Plaintiff asserts one
cause of action for general negligence. 
There are no well pleaded allegations of fraud, malice, or
oppression.  
Plaintiff has not opposed the motion or
asked for leave to amend.
Based on the foregoing, the Court grants
the motion to strike, without leave to amend. 
Conclusion
The Court OVERRULES the Demurrer of the CIM Defendants.
The Court GRANTS the Motion to Strike of the CIM
Defendants.
The Court ORDERS that as against the CIM Defendants, the
prayer for punitive damages on page 5, line 1, of the complaint is STRICKEN.
Moving
Party is to give notice.
