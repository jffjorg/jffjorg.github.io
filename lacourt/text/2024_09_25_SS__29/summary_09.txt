And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to Requests for Production (Set One). The plaintiff had served the requests on December 6, 2023, but the defendant did not timely respond. The defendant eventually served responses on April 5, 2024, but the plaintiff contended that these responses were not code compliant. The defendant then served further responses on June 18, 2024, which were not verified. The plaintiff filed the motion to compel further responses on August 5, 2024.

The judge found that the defendant's response to Request No. 11, which asked for documents reflecting cell phone or data communication sent or received by anyone in the defendant's vehicle during a specific time period, was code compliant. The defendant stated that it was unable to comply with the request because it believed the documents never existed. The judge held that the defendant did not waive its objections by not serving timely responses, and that the plaintiff did not request the name and address of the defendant's cell phone carrier in its original request.

The judge denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions, as the defendant did not unsuccessfully oppose the motion. The judge concluded that the defendant's response was code compliant and that the plaintiff did not have a right to the information it requested.
