And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for a trial preference due to his age and health. The plaintiff, who is 78 years old, has severe back pain and other health issues that make it necessary to have the trial set at a earlier date to prevent prejudicing his interest in the litigation. The plaintiff's health is such that he is unable to participate in the trial at a later date, and the judge has scheduled the trial for January 17, 2025, at 8:30 am. The final status conference is also reset to the same date and time.
