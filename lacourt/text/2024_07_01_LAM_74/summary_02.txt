And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants the defendants' motion to quash service of summons on the initial complaint. The defendants, US Capital Global Partners LLC, US Capital Global Holding Corporation, Charles Towle, Devon Zubka, and Iksvaku Spencer, argue that they were not properly served with the summons. The Judge finds that the service was defective because the process server did not deliver the papers to a person "apparently in charge" at the defendants' office, but rather to a security guard who refused to give her name. The Judge also finds that the defendants have shown that they were not effectively served, and that the plaintiffs did not carry their burden to prove the facts requisite to an effective service. As a result, the motion is granted, and the petition to compel arbitration is moot.
