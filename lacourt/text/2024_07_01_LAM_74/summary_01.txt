And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV). The motion challenges the jury's findings that the vehicle's intermittent light failure substantially impaired its use and that Ford willfully failed to meet its obligations under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.

The judge has denied the motion, finding that substantial evidence supports the jury's findings. The evidence shows that the light failure substantially impaired the vehicle's use and that Ford refused to replace the vehicle despite being aware of the defect. The judge has also rejected the defendants' argument that the plaintiffs' continued use of the vehicle after discovering the defect waives their claim.

The judge has ordered the defendants to give notice of this ruling.
