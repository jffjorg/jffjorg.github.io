  ORDER RE: 
 
MOTION OF
  DEFENDANT M STEPHEN CHO FOR FEES PURSUANT TO CCP §
  425.16



 
Background
On September 10, 2020, Creative Recovery Concepts, Inc. filed the
instant action against Defendants 8424 Western Plaza, LLC and Kathleen Janet
Haywood aka Kathleen Robinson. The Complaint alleges causes of action for (1)
breach of contract and (2) to set aside fraudulent transfer. 
On April 25, 2022, a Complaint was filed in the matter Janet
Haywood, et al. v. Stephen Cho, et al., Case No. 22STCV13629 (herein, the
“Haywood Action”). On February 9, 2023, Janet Haywood (“Haywood”) filed the
operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) in the Haywood Action against
Defendants Stephen Cho and Creative Recovery Concepts. The FAC alleges causes
of action for (1) breach of contract, (2) breach of implied covenant of good
faith and fair dealing, and (3) conspiracy to defraud.  
On July 6, 2023, M. Stephen Cho (erroneously sued as Stephen Cho)
(herein, “Cho’) filed a special motion to strike pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16 in the Haywood
Action. On October 31, 2023, the Court issued a minute order in the Haywood
Action providing, inter alia, that “the Court grants Cho’s special
motion to strike as to the third cause of action of the FAC. Cho’s motion is
otherwise denied.” 
On October 9, 2023, the Court issued a Nunc Pro Tunc Order in the
Haywood Action providing, inter alia, as follows: 
 
“It appearing to
the Court that through inadvertence and/or clerical error, the minute order of
10/09/2023 in the above-entitled action does not properly reflect the Court’s
order. At the direction of the Judicial Officer, said minute order is corrected
nunc pro tunc as of 10/09/2023, as follows: By adding: The Court orders the
following cases, 22STCV13629 and 20STCV34671, consolidated and assigned to
Department 50 in Stanley Mosk Courthouse for all purposes. The Court designates
20stcv34671 as the lead case. All future documents must be filed under 20stcv34671
(CREATIVE RECOVERY CONCEPTS, INC. vs 8424 WESTERN PLAZA, LLC., et al.). Case
numbers on all subsequent filings should be reflected under the lead case.”
(Emphasis added.) 
Cho
now moves for attorney’s fees and costs incurred by Cho in connection with his
special motion to strike. Haywood opposes. 
Discussion
The anti-SLAPP statute
provides that “a prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike
shall be entitled to recover that defendant’s attorney’s fees and costs.” (Code Civ. Proc.,     § 425.16, subd. (c)(1).) “[A]ny SLAPP defendant who brings a successful motion to strike is
entitled to mandatory attorney fees.” (Ketchum
v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122,
1131.) An award of fees may also include
“the fees incurred in enforcing the right to mandatory fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16.” (Id. at
p. 1141.) “It is well established that the amount of an attorney fee
award under the anti-SLAPP statute is computed by the trial court in accordance
with the familiar lodestar method.”
(569 East County Boulevard LLC v.
Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc. (2016)
6 Cal.App.5th 426, 432 [internal quotations and brackets omitted].) Under the lodestar method, the court tabulates the attorney fee
lodestar by multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended by the
reasonable hourly rate prevailing in the community for similar work.” (Ibid.)
With regard to the
number of hours reasonably expended, “the verified time statements of the
attorneys, as officers of the court, are entitled to credence in the absence of
a clear indication the records are erroneous.” (Horsford v. Board of Trustees of California State
University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th
359, 396.) In determining the reasonable hourly
rate, the “burden is on the successful party to prove the appropriate market
rate to be used in calculating the lodestar.” (MBNA
America Bank, N.A. v. Gorman (2006)
147 Cal.App.4th Supp. 1, 13.) The trial court may reduce the award
where the fee request appears unreasonably inflated, such as where the
attorneys’ efforts are unorganized or duplicative. (Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 635, fn. 21.)
Here, Cho states that he
“is seeking an award of $19,160.00, derived as follows: $11,600.00 for
the anti-SLAPP motion + $7,560.00 as fees costs [sic] for the instant motion…”
(Notice of Mot. at p. 2:3-4.) 
As an initial matter, Haywood asserts in the opposition that “the
motion should be denied because the partially successful anti-SLAPP motion has
no practical effect on the remaining causes of action to be litigated.” (Opp’n
at p. 3:16-17.) Haywood cites to City of Colton v. Singletary (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th
751, 782, where the
Court of Appeal noted that “[t]he
anti-SLAPP statute reflects the Legislature’s strong preference for awarding
attorney fees to successful defendants. The term prevailing party must be
interpreted broadly to favor an award of attorney fees to a partially
successful defendant. However, a fee award is not required when the motion,
though partially successful, was of no practical effect. [A] party who partially
prevails on an anti-SLAPP motion must generally be considered a prevailing
party unless the results of the motion were so insignificant that the party did
not achieve any practical benefit from bringing the motion. The determination whether a party prevailed on
an anti-SLAPP motion lies within the broad discretion of [the] trial court.”
(Internal quotations and references to [Citation.] omitted.) 
As set forth above, the Court granted Cho’s special motion to strike
as to the third cause of action of the FAC for conspiracy to defraud. (See
October 31, 2023 Minute Order.) In the 
opposition
to the instant motion, Haywood cites to IIG Wireless, Inc. v. Yi (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th
630, 652, where the
Court of Appeal noted that “[c]onspiracy
is not a separate tort, but a form of vicarious liability by which one
defendant can be held liable for the acts of another.” Haywood contends that “a
conspiracy cause of action is dependent on the success of the underlying cause
of action. Here, no underlying claim was alleged -- fraud was not alleged;
malicious prosecution was not alleged. In brief, striking the third cause of
action has no value or practical effect on the remaining causes of action
alleged and pending for breach of contract and breach of implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealing causes of action.” (Opp’n at p. 4:8-12.) Haywood
also contends that “[i]t would have been different if striking the cause of
action also removed a significant amount of damages prayed against Cho.
However, this is not the case, as there really is no practical effect or
benefit to Cho in striking the conspiracy cause of action.” (Opp’n at p.
4:4-6.) 
But as noted by Cho in the reply, the third cause of action “accused
Mr. Cho of engaging in a conspiracy to commit fraud, the act, thus potentially
exposing him to punitive damages…” (Reply at p. 4:10-11.) Indeed, Haywood seeks
“[p]unitive and exemplary damages” in the prayer for relief of the FAC. (FAC,
p. 8:10.) Cho also asserts that dismissal of the third cause of action “impacted…whether
the same factual allegations remain to be litigated - they are not; whether
discovery and motion practice have been narrowed - it has been; and the extent
to which future litigation expenses and strategy were impacted by the motion
-most certainly reduced.” (Reply at pp. 4:12-5:2.) The Court agrees with Cho that
he achieved a practical benefit from bringing the
anti-SLAPP motion. 
Cho’s counsel Dilip Vithlani states in his supporting declaration that
“[i]n connection with the anti-SLAPP motion, I have expended in excess of 16
hours in preparing the anti-SLAPP motion, appearing in person at the hearing on
ex parte application to (1) Set aside this court’s Tentative Order granting
Defendant’s anti-SLAPP motion and (2) to continue the hearing on the anti-SLAPP
motion to allow Plaintiff to file her Opposition to the anti-SLAPP motion, and
the hearing on the anti-SLAPP motion.” (Vithlani Decl., ¶ 8.) Mr. Vithlani
further states that “[i]n connection with the instant motion for fees, Mr. Cho
will accept an award of 10 hours of fees. The hours include preparing and
filing this motion, reviewing of the Opposition and preparing a Reply and
appearing at the hearing on the instant motion…Costs incurred in connection
with the anti-SLAPP are $60.00.” (Vithlani Decl., ¶¶ 20-21.) 
Mr. Vithlani’s requested hourly rate is $725.00 per hour. (Vithlani
Decl., ¶ 9.) Mr. Vithlani’s states that he has been “practicing law since
January 1999,” and his background and experience are set forth in the
supporting declaration. (Vithlani Decl., ¶¶ 10-12.) Mr. Vithlani asserts that
“[b]ased on the Laffey Matrix for 2022, the accepted billing rate for attorneys
with my experience in the Los Angeles area is in excess of $900.00 per hour. My
rate of $725.00 per hour is well below that range.” (Vithlani Decl., ¶ 9.)[1]
In the opposition, Haywood asserts that “Cho has failed to submit
declarations by other attorneys with respect to the rate prevailing in the
community for similar work performed by attorneys of comparable skill,
experience, and reputation…” (Opp’n at p. 5:20-22.) However, Haywood does not
appear to cite to legal authority demonstrating that such declarations are
required. Haywood also argues that “[t]he Legal Trends Report published
annually by Clio, a billing service used by thousands of legal professionals
and attorneys found that $344 was the average hourly rate for civil litigation
attorneys in California.” (Opp’n at p. 6:9-11.) However, this assertion is not
supported by competent evidence. No declaration was filed in connection with
the opposition. 
The Court finds that Cho has demonstrated that his counsel’s hourly
billing rate is reasonable. 
In the opposition, Haywood also asserts that Cho “has failed to submit
any billing statements from Vilthani in order for the Court to determine if
fees were reasonably generated.” (Opp’n at p. 5:22-24.) In the motion, Cho cites
to Cruz v. Fusion Buffet, Inc. (2020) 57 Cal.App.5th
221, 237-238, where the Court of Appeal noted that “[t]he declaration of an
attorney as to the number of hours worked on a particular case may be
sufficient evidence to support an award of attorney fees, even in the absence
of detailed time records. Indeed, sufficient evidence to support an attorney fee award may
include [d]eclarations of counsel setting forth the reasonable hourly rate, the
number of hours worked and the tasks performed. There is no requirement that
an attorney provide time records or billing statements.” (Internal quotations
and citations omitted.) 
            As discussed, Cho’s counsel states that he “expended
in excess of 16 hours in preparing the anti-SLAPP motion, appearing in person
at the hearing on ex parte application to (1) Set aside this court’s Tentative
Order granting Defendant’s anti-SLAPP motion and (2) to continue the hearing on
the anti-SLAPP motion to allow Plaintiff to file her Opposition to the
anti-SLAPP motion, and the hearing on the anti-SLAPP motion.” (Vithlani Decl.,
¶ 8.) Cho’s counsel further states that “[i]n connection with the instant
motion for fees, Mr. Cho will accept an award of 10 hours of fees. The hours
include preparing and filing this motion, reviewing of the Opposition and
preparing a Reply and appearing at the hearing on the instant motion.”
(Vithlani Decl., ¶ 20.) The Court finds that Mr. Vithlani’s declaration is
sufficient and that the requested time is reasonable. 
Lastly, Cho states in the notice of motion that he seeks “$7,560.00 as
fees costs for the instant motion.” (Notice of Mot. at p. 2:4.) However, as
noted by Haywood and as set forth above, Mr. Vithlani states that “[i]n
connection with the instant motion for fees, Mr. Cho will accept an award of 10
hours of fees.” (Vithlani Decl., ¶ 20.) 10 hours multiplied by the requested
hourly rate of $725/hour is $7,250.00. Adding the requested $60.00 in costs to
this amount results in a total of $7,310.00, not $7,560.00. Thus, the Court
deducts $250.00 from the total amount requested. 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, Cho’s motion for
attorney’s fees and costs is granted in part. The Court awards Cho a total of $18,910.00
in attorney’s fees and costs.  
Cho is to provide notice of this Order.
