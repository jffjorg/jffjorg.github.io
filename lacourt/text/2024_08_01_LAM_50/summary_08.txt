The judge has granted the plaintiff's request for judicial notice, but has identified several defects in the submitted default judgment package. The proposed judgment does not clearly state how the subject Grant Deed and Deed of Trust will be reformed, and the legal descriptions contained in the documents reference a "60 FOOT WIDE ROAD" instead of the correct "so foot wide road". The judge has ordered the plaintiff to file and serve a revised proposed judgment that addresses these defects by [undetermined date]. The hearing on the status conference review of the default judgment package has been continued to [undetermined date] at 10:00 a.m. in Department 50.
