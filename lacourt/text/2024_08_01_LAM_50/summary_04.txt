Significant Statements:
  "The essence of the cause of action for trespass is an 'unauthorized entry' onto the land of another." (Civic Western Corp. v. Zila Industries, Inc., supra, 66 Cal.App.3d at p. 16)
  "A principal may be liable for the wrongful conduct of its agent, even if that conduct is criminal, in one of three ways: (1) if the principal directly authorizes ... [the tort or] crime to be committed; (2) if the agent commits the tort in the scope of his employment and in performing service on behalf of the principal, regardless of whether the wrong is authorized or ratified by [the principal], and even if the wrong is criminal; or (3) if the principal ratifies its agent's conduct after the fact by... voluntarily electing to adopt the [agent's] conduct ... as its own." (Doe v. Roman Catholic Archbishop of Los Angeles, supra, 247 Cal.App.4th at p. 969)
  "Civil liability may not be imposed merely because an individual belonged to a group, some members of which committed acts of violence. For liability to be imposed by reason of association alone, it is necessary to establish that the group itself possessed unlawful goals and that the individual held a specific intent to further those illegal aims." (NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., supra, 458 U.S. at p. 920)
