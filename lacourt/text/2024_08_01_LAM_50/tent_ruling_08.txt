[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:  
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 




            
Plaintiff
Planet Home Lending, LLC (“Plaintiff”) requests entry of default judgment
against Defendant Rudy Ramiro De Leon Jr. Plaintiff seeks judgment set forth in
Plaintiff’s proposed judgment for reformation of instrument. 
The
Court grants Plaintiff’s request for judicial notice. However, the Court notes
a few defects with the submitted default judgment package. The proposed
judgment provides, inter alia, as follows: 
 
“3.       That certain Grant Deed recorded on July
14, 2022, as Document No. 20220722663 in the Official Records of Los Angeles is
hereby reformed to reflect the true intention of the parties thereto; 
 
4. That certain
Deed of Trust recorded on July 14, 2022, as Document No. 20220722664 in the
Official Records of Los Angeles is hereby reformed to reflect the true
intention of the parties thereto…”  
However, the proposed judgment does not
clearly state how the subject Grant Deed and Deed of Trust will be reformed. It
is not clear from the proposed judgment that the Grant Deed and Deed of Trust
will be reformed to add the correct spelling of “plat” to the legal
description. It appears that the prayer for relief of Plaintiff’s Complaint
more clearly sets forth the relief sought. 
In addition, the legal description of
“Parcel 2” in paragraph 2 of the proposed judgment references a “so foot
wide road.” This appears to be a typo. The legal descriptions contained in the
subject Grant Deed and Deed of Trust reference a “60 FOOT WIDE ROAD.”
(O’Connell Decl., ¶¶ 5-6, Exs. 1-2.)  
Based
on the foregoing, the Court continues the hearing on the status
conference review of default judgment package to _____________, 2024 at 10:00 a.m.
in Dept. 50. On or before _____________, 2024, Plaintiff shall file and serve a revised
proposed judgment that addresses the defects identified above.
