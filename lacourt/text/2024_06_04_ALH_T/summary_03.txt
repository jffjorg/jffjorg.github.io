And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the motion to compel discovery filed by Plaintiff Kenneth Wellbeck. The Plaintiff served interrogatories on November 16, 2023, but the Defendant failed to respond. Although the Plaintiff sent a meet and confer letter on April 30, 2024, the Defendant still failed to provide any responses. Therefore, the court finds that the Plaintiff is entitled to a court order directing the Defendant to provide verified responses without objections to the discovery requests. The Defendant is ordered to provide the responses within 20 days of the order, and the Plaintiff is to give notice.
