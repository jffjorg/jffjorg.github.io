 Case Number:  21STCV16457    Hearing Date:   June 4, 2024    Dept:  T Motion to Compel Discovery 
Moving Party:                  Plaintiff Kenneth Wellbeck
Responding Party:          None
Tentative Ruling:             Granted
BACKGROUND
On May 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion to compel
discovery.  No opposition was filed.
LEGAL STANDARD
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to
serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
responses and for a monetary sanction. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) The statute contains no time
limit for a motion to compel where no responses have been served. All that need
be shown in the moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly
served on the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no
response of any kind has been served. 
(Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905–906.)
DISCUSSION
On November 16, 2023, Plaintiff served on Defendant Form
Interrogatories. (Petale Decl., ¶¶ 2-3; Exh. 1.) Because Defendant failed to
respond, Plaintiff sent her a courtesy meet and confer letter on April 30,
2024.  (Id., ¶ 4; Exh. 2.) Defendant has
still failed to provide any responses whatsoever. 
As Plaintiff properly served the requests for discovery, and
Defendant has failed to provide responses, the Court finds Plaintiff is
entitled to a court order directing Defendant to provide verified responses
without objections to the discovery requests served on Plaintiff.  Therefore, the motion is granted. Sanctions
were not requested.
CONCLUSION
Plaintiff’s motion to compel discovery is GRANTED.  Defendant is ordered to provide verified
responses without objections to the discovery request within 20 days of this
order.  Plaintiff to give notice.
