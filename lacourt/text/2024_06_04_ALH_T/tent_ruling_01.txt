Armando Ruiz Carlos
Tentative Ruling:             Deny
as moot; Sanctions awarded.
On May 5, 2024, Defendant HD Supply Construction Supply,
Limited Partnership (“Defendant”) filed the instant motions to compel discovery
responses. The court considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers. 
LEGAL STANDARD
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to
serve a timely response, the party propounding the interrogatories may move for
an order compelling a response to the interrogatories. (Code Civ. Proc. section
2030.290, subd. (b).) The same applies to a party that fails to respond to a
request for document production. (Code Civ. Proc. section 2031.300, subd. (b).)
Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (b),
provides that if a party fails to respond to a request for admission, “[t]he
requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents
and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted”.
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300,
subdivisions (c), provides a court shall impose sanctions against a party who
successfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response unless it finds
that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or
that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. Code of
Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (c), provides, in part: “It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary . . . on the party or attorney, or
both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission
necessitated this motion.”
The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in
favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even where no
opposition is filed, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving
party after the motion was filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348(a).)
DISCUSSION
Here, the requested discovery has been provided and as such
the motions are MOOT. However, sanctions are still warranted as Plaintiff’s
conduct necessitated motion practice. (See Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
3.1348(a).) Defendant requests sanctions in the amount of $484 (2.2 hrs. x
$220/hr.) for the motion related to request for admissions, $440 (2 hr. x
220/hr.) for the motion related to special interrogatories, $506 (2.3 hrs. x
220/hr.) for the motion related to form interrogatories, and $462 (2.1 hrs. $220/hr.)
for the motion related to request for production of documents. The Court finds
these amounts reasonable. 
Based on the foregoing, the motions are MOOT. Sanctions are
imposed against Plaintiff and counsel of record in the amount of $1,892 total.  Sanctions to be paid within 30 days of
Defendant giving notice.  Defendant to
give notice.
