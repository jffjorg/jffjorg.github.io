And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motions filed by Kia America Inc., the defendant, to deem requests for admission admitted and to impose sanctions on the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs, Derrick Ervin and Phyllis Ervin, failed to respond to the defendant's requests for admission, which were served on April 12, 2024. The court has granted the motions and deemed the requests for admission admitted. The court has also imposed sanctions of $500 each on the plaintiffs and their counsel, Downtown L.A. Law Group, payable to the defendant. The court's decision is based on the failure of the plaintiffs to timely respond to the requests for admission, as required by California law.
