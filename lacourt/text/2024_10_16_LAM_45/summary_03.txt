```

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the Motion to Strike filed by Irori Restaurant Management Inc. and Byung Ha Chang. The motion was filed on the same day that default was entered against the defendants, which the judge finds to be improper. The judge notes that once default has been entered, a defendant is no longer an active party in the litigation and is not entitled to take further affirmative steps such as filing a pleading or motion. The judge also notes that the defendants failed to meet and confer with the plaintiff before filing the motion, as required by California law. The judge sets an order to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed if the defendants fail to obtain a default judgment within 45 days.
