Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in plain English:

The court is considering a demurrer filed by the defendants in a case brought by the plaintiffs, Baird A. Brown, Baird Brown, and Ann Brown. The defendants argue that the plaintiffs' claims are based on the allegation that the defendants stole the plaintiffs' clients, but the defendants claim that this is impossible as a matter of law because the clients were not theirs to steal.

The court has considered the evidence and arguments presented and has ruled that the demurrer is overruled. The court concludes that the plaintiffs' allegations are sufficient to state a cause of action, and that the defendants' arguments are unpersuasive.

The court also notes that the defendants' argument is based on a narrow interpretation of the plaintiffs' allegations, and that the plaintiffs have alleged that the defendants entered into a conspiracy to take the plaintiffs' clients, which took place over a period of time, including before and after Brown's suspension. The court concludes that the defendants' argument is not supported by the evidence and that the plaintiffs' claims are not untimely.
