Background
            On
February 15, 2024, Plaintiff Joo Young Jun (“Plaintiff” or “Jun”) filed an action
against Defendants Irori Restaurant Management Inc. (“Irori”), Byung Ha Chang
(“Chang”), Min Jung Son (“Son”), and Does 1 through 50 for (1) failure to pay
minimum wages in violation of Labor Code sections 1194, 1194.2, (2) failure to
pay overtime wages in violation of Labor Code sections 204, 510, (3) failure to
provide rest periods in violation of Labor Code section 226.7, (4) failure to
provide meal periods in violation of Labor Code sections 226.7, 512, (5)
failure to furnish timely and accurate itemized wage statements in violation of
Labor Code section 226, (6) failure to pay compensation due upon separation in
violation of Labor Code section 203, and (7) violation of the Unfair
Competition Law.  The action arises out
of Plaintiff’s alleged employment as a Sushi Chef for Defendant Irori from
November 2020 to December 2023.
            On
August 26, 2024, the Court denied the Motions to Quash Service of Summons filed
by Defendants Irori and Chang and ordered Defendants to file responsive
pleadings within 20 days.
            On
September 18, 2024, default was entered against Defendants Chang and Irori.
            On
the same day, after default had been entered, Defendants Irori and Chang filed
the instant Motion to Strike Portions of Complaint (“Motion”).  Plaintiff filed an Opposition on October 1,
2024, and Defendants filed a Reply on October 9, 2024.
Legal Standard
The court may, upon a motion, or at
any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd. (a).)  The court may also strike all or any part of
any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a
court rule, or an order of the court.  (Id. at § 436, subd. (b).)  The grounds for moving to strike must appear
on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice.  (Id. at § 437.)
Moreover, Code of Civil Procedure
section 435.5 requires that “[b]efore filing a motion to strike pursuant to
this chapter, the moving party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone
with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to the motion to strike
for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that
resolves the objections to be raised in the motion to strike.”  (Code of Civ. Proc., § 435.5, subd.
(a).)
 
 
Discussion
            The Court finds that
default has been entered against moving Defendants Irori and Chang.  Once default has been entered, a defendant is
“no longer an active party in the litigation” and not entitled to take further
affirmative steps such as filing a pleading or motion.  (Sporn v. Home Depot USA, Inc. (2005)
126 Cal. App. 4th 1294, 1301.)  Defendants
have no right to participate in the proceedings until either (a) default is set
aside or (b) a default judgment is entered.  (Devlin v. Kearny Mesa AMC/Jeep/Renault,
Inc. (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 381, 385-386.)
Moreover, according to California Rules of
Court, rule 3.110(h):
When a default is entered, the party who
requested the entry of default must obtain a default judgment against the
defaulting party within 45 days after the default was entered, unless the court
has granted an extension of time. The court may issue an order to show cause
why sanctions should not be imposed if that party fails to obtain entry of
judgment against a defaulting party or to request an extension of time to apply
for a default judgment within that time.
Here, default was entered against Defendants Irori
and Chang on September 18, 2024, around 3:43 p.m.  Defendants filed the instant Motion on the
same day around 10:45 p.m.  Given that
default had already been entered, Defendants were not entitled to file a
motion.
Accordingly, the Motion to Strike, filed by Defendants
Irori Restaurant Management Inc. and Byung Ha Chang, is DENIED.
The Court sets an Order to Show Cause re: Entry
of Default Judgment for ___________ at ______ in Department 45 of the Stanley
Mosk Courthouse.
            It
is so ordered.
Dated: October 16,
2024
