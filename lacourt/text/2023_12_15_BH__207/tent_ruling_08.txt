MOTION
 
              Plaintiffs
Christian Spannoff, 10 NB Partnership, and 01 BH Partnership (“Plaintiffs”)
seek reconsideration of the Court’s order of October 26, 2023, in which the
Court granted Defendant’s motion to dismiss for failure to bring the action to
trial within 5 years pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 583.310.  The Motion is unopposed.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure
section 1008, subdivision (a), “[w]hen an application for an order has been
made to a judge, or to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or
granted conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within
10 days after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order
and based upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make an
application to the same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the
matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior order.  The party making the application shall state
by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge, what
order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances,
or law are claimed to be shown.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (a).)  Where
the statutory requirements are met, reconsideration should be granted; upon
reconsideration, however, the court may simply reaffirm its original
order.  (Corns v. Miller (1986)
181 Cal.App.3d 195, 202.)  
 
The moving party on a motion for
reconsideration “must provide not only new evidence but also a satisfactory
explanation for the failure to produce that evidence at an earlier time[.]” (Mink
v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1338, 1342, internal quotations &
citations omitted; see New York Times Co. v. Superior Court (2005)
135 Cal.App.4th 206, 212 [on a motion for reconsideration, a party must present
new or different facts, circumstances, or law, which the moving party “could
not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered or produced” in connection with
the original hearing].)
 
PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
            Plaintiffs
filed the complaint on February 14, 2017. 
As discussed in more depth below, the case was stayed for a time due to
pending bankruptcy proceedings.  On April
30, 2021, a jury trial was set for January 24, 2022.  (See June 1, 2021 Minute Order.)  On January 24, Plaintiffs’ counsel did not
appear, so the Court set a Final Status Conference for April 8, 2022 and
scheduled a jury trial for April 25, 2022. 
(January 24, 2022 Minute Order.)
 
            On April 8, 2022, the parties orally
stipulated to “waive the five (5) year statute of limitations to bring the
matter to trial” and were “directed to file a stipulation and proposed order
regarding the waiver” and orally stipulated to continue the trial from April
25, 2022 to September 12, 2022.  (April
8, 2022 Minute Order.)  On April 20,
2022, the parties filed a written stipulation to extend the five-year deadline
to October 22, 2022.  The Court granted
the written stipulation.
 
            At the September 12, 2022 trial,
there were no appearances by either party. 
The Court continued the jury trial to September 28, 2022.  (September 12, 2022 Minute Order.)  On September 28, 2022, the Court continued
the final status conference, status conference re mediation, and jury trial to
October 18, 2022.  (September 28, 2022
Minute Order.)
 
            On October 18, 2022, the final
status conference and jury trial were placed off calendar so the parties could
pursue a mandatory settlement conference.
 
            The February 17, 2023 Minute Order
reflects, “All parties orally stipulate to waive the five year statute of
limitations to bring the case to trial, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
Section 583.330(b), to 09/01/2023.” 
(February 17, 2023 Minute Order.) 
The final status conference was scheduled for April 28, 2023, and a
non-jury trial was scheduled for May 8, 2023. 
(Ibid.)  At the March 24,
2023 mandatory settlement conference, the case did not settle.  (See March 24, 2023 Minute Order.)
 
            The April 28, 2023 Minute Order
indicates, “Pursuant to oral stipulation, the Final Status Conference scheduled
for 04/28/2023 is continued to 09/15/23 at 09:30 AM in Department 207 at
Beverly Hills Courthouse” and “Pursuant to oral stipulation, the Non-Jury Trial
scheduled for 05/08/2023 is advanced to this date and continued to 10/02/23 at
10:00 AM in Department 207 at Beverly Hills Courthouse.”  Counsel for Defendant was to give notice.  (April 28, 2023 Minute Order.)
 
            On September 14, 2023, Defendant
filed a “Notice of Violation of Code of Civil Procedure 583.310.”
 
            At the September 15, 2023 hearing,
Defendant indicated that Plaintiffs failed to serve Defendant with the trial
documents, and Defendant argued the case should be dismissed pursuant to the
5-year rule.  The Court permitted the
parties to brief the issue.  Further, the
Court continued the final status conference and trial because the parties were
not ready for trial as the Court did not receive joint trial documents as
required.[1]
 
            On October 26, 2023, the Court
granted Defendant’s unopposed motion to dismiss the case for failure to bring
the action to trial within 5 years pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
583.310.  The Court found that Plaintiffs
failed to bring the action to trial by the stipulated October 2, 2023 date, and
there was no further stipulation to extend the statutory deadline.  (October 26, 2023.)
 
ANALYSIS
 
As a threshold issue, the Court notes that Plaintiffs did not oppose
Defendant’s motion to dismiss.  The moving party on a motion for reconsideration must
provide not only new evidence but also a satisfactory explanation for the
failure to produce that evidence at an earlier time.  All Plaintiffs offer in this regard is a
declaration explaining that co-counsel failed to communicate with each other,
resulting in Plaintiffs’ inadvertent failure to prepare and submit a joint
trial package or a response to the Motion to Dismiss.  (Sirota Decl. ¶¶ 6-13.)  Under the circumstances, the Court finds that
with reasonable diligence, Plaintiffs’ could have produced the evidence they
now proffer regarding the bankruptcy stays in opposition to the Motion to
Dismiss.
 
            Further, the Court finds that the Motion
fails on the merits.  
 
Plaintiffs contend 01 BH Partnership filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
twice, resulting in two automatic stays of this case –the first from April 25,
2018 to February 15, 2019, lasting 9 months and 21 days, and the second from July
31, 2019 to February 23, 2021, lasting 17 months and 24 days.  (Mot. at p. 7 and Ex. 2 [Bankruptcy
docket].)  Thus, Plaintiffs contend, by
operation of Code of Civil Procedure, section 583.340, the 5-year deadline is
automatically extended by 27 months and 15 days by virtue of the automatic
bankruptcy stays.  In addition, Plaintiffs
contend that Emergency Order 10, extends the 5-year rule by an additional 6
months. Thus, Plaintiffs argue, the stipulations to extend the 5-year deadline
were unnecessary, as the deadline is not until November 28, 2024.
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 583.340 provides, “In computing the
time within which an action must be brought to trial pursuant to this article,
there shall be excluded the time during which any of the following conditions
existed: […] (b) Prosecution or trial of the action was stayed or
enjoined.”  Similarly, California Rules
of Court, Emergency Rule 10 provides, “Notwithstanding any other law, including
Code of Civil Procedure section 583.310, for all civil actions filed on or
before April 6, 2020, the time in which to bring the action to trial is
extended by six months for a total time of five years and six months.”  
 
“The terms “waiver” and “forfeiture” long have been used
interchangeably. As the United States Supreme Court has explained, however,
waiver is different from forfeiture. Whereas forfeiture is the failure to make
the timely assertion of a right, waiver is the ‘intentional relinquishment or
abandonment of a known right.  Thus, it
is most accurate to characterize the issue as whether a defendant forfeits the
right to object to venue by failing to timely raise such an objection prior to
trial.”  (People v. Simon (2001)
25 Cal.4th 1082, 1097 [cleaned up]; see also Osman v. Superior Court
(2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 32, 36.)   As such, the Court considers Plaintiffs’
belated contention to be a forfeiture of any procedural or substantive argument
they could have raised during prior proceedings when the 5-year rule was
addressed with and by the Court, resulting in Plaintiffs stipulating to
extensions of the 5-year rule without raising the purported extensions of time
to bring the action to trial.  
 
Notwithstanding Plaintiffs’ forfeiture, the Court’s record does not
comport with Plaintiffs’ timing.  Plaintiff
01 BH Partnership filed a Notice of Stay on May 10, 2018, indicating that it
filed for bankruptcy on April 25, 2018.  At
the November 5, 2018 status conference, counsel represented to the Court that
the Bankruptcy proceeding was dismissed. 
(November 5, 2018 Minute Order.)  Plaintiffs
now submit evidence that the debtor was dismissed on June 21, 2018. Thus, the
first bankruptcy stay was from April 25, 2018 to June 21, 2018, or 57 days.  Plaintiffs now contend that the debtor
contested and appealed the dismissal, and the first bankruptcy proceeding was
not formally closed until February 15, 2019. 
But Plaintiffs informed the Court on November 5, 2018 that the
bankruptcy proceeding had been dismissed and this case resumed and was not
stayed.
 
On August 28, 2019, Plaintiff 01 BH Partnership filed a “Notice of
Filing Bankruptcy,” indicating a second bankruptcy was filed on August 1,
2019.  The Bankruptcy document attached
to the Notice indicates it was filed July 31, 2019.  On July 29, 2020, Plaintiffs filed a
Bankruptcy Status Report, attached to which was an April 29, 2020 order
granting a relief from stay as to this and the consolidated case number
BC651893.  Thus the second bankruptcy
stay lasted from July 31, 2019 to April 29, 2020, or 273 days.  Thus, even if Plaintiffs had been diligent in
providing the Court with evidence of the bankruptcy stays prior to their motion
for reconsideration, the maximum extension the bankruptcy stays could have
provided was 57 + 273 = 330 days, or a trial date of January 10, 2023.  Even with the 6-month emergency extension
added, the deadline to bring the case to trial would have been July 10,
2023.  
 
Thus, the oral stipulations to extend the five-year deadline were
necessary, both because the Court was not previously provided information
regarding the exact duration of the bankruptcy stays, and because the deadline
had passed in any event.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
            Therefore,
the Court denies Plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration.  
 
            The
Clerk of the Court shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling.
