And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to quash service of summons filed by Heather Marie Cook, a defendant in a personal injury lawsuit. The plaintiff, Jessica Dutkovic, alleges that she was injured while descending an outdoor staircase at a property owned and operated by Mauser Harmony with Nature Foundation, Inc. in Costa Rica. Cook moves to quash service of summons on the grounds of lack of personal jurisdiction. The judge finds that the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is insufficient to rebut Cook's declaration that she has not done business in California and does not have any contacts with the state. The judge also finds that the controversy at issue does not arise from Mauser Harmony's registration to do business in California. As a result, the judge concludes that exercising jurisdiction over Cook, a resident of Costa Rica, over an incident that occurred in Costa Rica, would not comport with fair play and substantial justice. The judge grants Cook's motion to quash and orders that the clerk of the court provide notice of the ruling.
