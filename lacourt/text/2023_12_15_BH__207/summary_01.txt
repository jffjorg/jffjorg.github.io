Here is the English text to summarize this judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants the plaintiff's unopposed motion for leave to amend the complaint to include damages not previously recoverable in an unlawful detainer matter. The plaintiff seeks to amend the complaint to include additional monetary damages, including the entire balance of defendant's unpaid rent, commencing with the initial default in November 2020 and through to the defendant's vacating the premises. The court finds that the motion satisfies both the procedural and substantive requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324. The plaintiff shall file and serve the proposed first amended complaint on or before January 12, 2024.
