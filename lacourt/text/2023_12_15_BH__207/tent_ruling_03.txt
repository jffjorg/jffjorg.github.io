MOTION
 
Plaintiff David Shaker (“Plaintiff”) moves to consolidate this case, Shaker
v. April 26th, LLC, et al. (Super. Ct. L.A. County, 2022, No. 22SMCV01452)
with the small claims case, 1033 3rd Street Apartments, LLC v. Shaker (Super.
Ct. L.A. County, 2022 No. 22SMSC00129) for all purposes.  Defendant 1033 3rd Street Apartments, LLC
(“1033”) opposes the motion.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Code of Civil Procedure,
section 1048, subdivision (a) provides:
 
When actions involving a
common question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may order a
joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the actions; it
may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such orders concerning
proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.
 
            Per Local Rule 3.3, subdivision (g),
“Cases may not be consolidated unless they are in the same department.  A motion to consolidate two or more cases may
be noticed and heard after the cases, initially filed in different departments,
have been related into a single department, or if the cases were already
assigned to that department.”  (Super.
Ct. L.A. County, Local Rules, rule 3.3(g)(1).) 
Once the Court relates the cases, the Court may consolidate the actions
and order a joint trial on matters that “involve[e] a common question of law or
fact.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1048, subd.
(a).)
 
            Procedurally,
Plaintiff caused the actions to be related, and both cases are currently
pending in the same department.  
 
               Substantively,
Plaintiff argues that the parties in both cases are the same and “the outcome
of each case will have a bearing on the other case.”  Specifically, Plaintiff contends that both
cases share a common question of fact, to wit, whether tenant owes landlord or
landlord owes tenant money regarding the same apartment unit over which
habitability is contested.  Further,
Plaintiff contends judicial economy is best served by consolidation because an
appeal of the small claims matter would mean a trial de novo in Superior Court,
and if not appealed, the small claims matter would have no res judicata effect
on the other matter.
 
            1033
argues that Plaintiff has failed to meet his burden to establish that the small
claims matter, which 1033 filed against Plaintiff to collect unpaid rent, should
be consolidated with the lawsuit Plaintiff filed, which alleges 13 causes of
action, and involves medical records and experts regarding Plaintiff’s alleged
personal injuries.  1033 further argues
that it will be prejudiced because the trial date in the small claims matter
has been and will continue to be delayed.
 
            The
Court agrees with Plaintiff that the matters should be consolidated.  Plaintiff’s complaint alleges that Defendant
failed to keep Plaintiff’s apartment unit habitable, causing black mold to grow
and develop, ultimately causing Plaintiff’s alleged health complications.  Thus, the habitability and condition of the
apartment pertains both to Plaintiff’s defenses in the small claims matter for
back rent and to Plaintiff’s operative claims in this matter.  In essence, the cases are mirror images of
each other, regarding the habitable conditions of and rent owed on the same
underlying apartment.  Moreover, both
party and judicial resources will be conserved by avoiding the duplicative
litigation that would result from litigating whether and to what extent
Plaintiff owes bank rent and whether and to what extent the apartment was
uninhabitable such that certain amounts should be deducted from any back rent
Plaintiff owes first in the small claims matter, and then again in the
unlimited civil division.
 
            To
mitigate any potential prejudice to 1033, the Court will seek to expeditiously
set the consolidated action for trial.  The
Court may also, if necessary, issue an order to try the issues of habitability
and amount of back rent owed separately from Plaintiff’s medical damages,
should expert discovery pertaining to Plaintiff’s alleged physical injuries create
any barriers to expediently resolving the issues of habitability and rent owed.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court grants Plaintiff’s motion to consolidate Shaker
v. April 26th, LLC, et al. (Super. Ct. L.A. County, 2022, No. 22SMCV01452)
with 1033 3rd Street Apartments, LLC v. Shaker (Super. Ct. L.A. County,
2022 No. 22SMSC00129).
 
The Court further orders that the cases are consolidated for all
purposes and Shaker v. April 26th, LLC, et al. (Super. Ct. L.A. County,
2022 No. 22SMCV01452) is designated as the lead case per California Rules of
Court, rule 3.350(b).  The Court further
orders that all proceedings and hearing dates in 1033 3rd Street Apartments,
LLC v. Shaker (Super. Ct. L.A. County, 2022 No. 22SMSC00129) are vacated.
 
            Plaintiff shall provide notice of
the Court’s ruling and file a proof of service of such.
