MOTION
 
            This
case arises from an injury Plaintiff Jessica Dutkovic (“Plaintiff”) allegedly
suffered while descending an outdoor staircase at a property owned and operated
by Defendant Mauser Harmony with Nature Foundation, Inc. (“Mauser Harmony”) in
Costa Rica.  
 
            Specially
appearing Defendant Heather Marie Cook (“Cook”), director of Mauser Harmony, moves
to quash service of the summons and complaint on the basis of lack of personal
jurisdiction.  Plaintiff opposes the
motion and Cook replies.[1]
 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
            In
opposition to Cook’s Motion, Plaintiff references exhibits to a Request for
Judicial Notice filed in connection with Plaintiff’s opposition to Cook’s
concurrently-filed motion to stay or dismiss for inconvenient forum.  As such, the Court addresses the Request for
Judicial Notice here as well.
 
            Plaintiff
requests the Court to take judicial notice of the following documents:
 
1.     
Exhibit
1 – the California Secretary of State website’s public entry for Mauser Harmony
 
2.     
Exhibit
2 – the Statement of Information Defendant prepared and publicly filed with the
California Secretary of State
 
3.     
Exhibit
3 – the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs public entry
for Mauser Harmony
 
4.     
Exhibit
4 – the Statement and Designation by Foreign Corporation Mauser Harmony prepared
and publicly filed with the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory
Affairs
 
5.     
Exhibit
5 – Mauser Harmony’s 2019 form 990-PF Return of Private Foundation prepared and
publicly filed with the Internal Revenue Service
 
6.     
Exhibit
6 – a copy of Defendant Heather Cook’s LinkedIn page as of October 30, 2023
 
7.     
Exhibit
7 – a copy of Defendant Heather Cook’s online resume/CV
 
Official notices, statements, and certificates made by the Secretary
of State or Franchise Tax Board are properly the subject of judicial notice as
documents reflecting official acts of the executive department of the State of
California, pursuant to Evidence Code, section 452, subdivision (c).  (Friends of Shingle Springs Interchange,
Inc. v. County of El Dorado (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1470, 1483–1484.)        Similarly, official notices, statements,
and certificates made by the IRS are documents reflecting official acts of the executive
department of the United States.  However,
“materials prepared by private parties and merely on file with the state [or
federal] agencies” may not be properly judicially noticed as an official act of
a legislative, executive, or judicial department of the United States or any
state of the United States.  (People
v. Thacker (1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 594, 598.)  Therefore, the Court grants Plaintiff’s
request as to Exhibits 1 and 3.  However,
because Exhibits 2, 4, and 5 were all prepared and filed by a private party,
they are not “official statements” made by the California Secretary of State,
Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs, or the federal Internal
Revenue Service.  Therefore, the Court
denies Plaintiff’s request for judicial notice as to Exhibits 2, 4, and 5.
 
The Court similarly denies Plaintiff’s request for judicial notice of
Exhibits 6 and 7.  It cannot be said that
these website printouts are either “of such common knowledge” or “capable of
immediate determination by resort to sources of reasonably indisputably
accuracy” such that they cannot be reasonably subject to dispute.
 
LEGAL
STANDARDS
 
“A defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time to plead or
within any further time that the court may for good cause allow, may serve and
file a notice of motion for one or more of the following purposes:  (1) To quash service of summons on the ground
of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10, subd.
(a)(1).)  
 
“[W]hen jurisdiction is challenged by a nonresident defendant, the
burden of proof is upon the plaintiff to demonstrate that ‘minimum contacts’
exist between the defendant and the forum state to justify imposition of
personal jurisdiction.” (Mihlon v. Superior Court (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d
703, 710.) It is thus upon the plaintiff to demonstrate by a preponderance of
the evidence that all jurisdictional criteria are met. (Ziller Electronics
Lab GmbH v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 1222, 1232.)   
 
Moreover, “on a challenge to personal jurisdiction by a motion to
quash, the plaintiff has the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the
evidence, the factual bases justifying the exercise of jurisdiction.”  (ViaView, Inc. v. Retzlaff (2016) 1
Cal.App.5th 198, 209–210 (hereafter ViaView).)  “The plaintiff must come forward with
affidavits and other competent evidence to carry this burden and cannot simply
rely on allegations in an unverified complaint.”  (Id. at p. 210.)  If plaintiff meets this burden, “it becomes
the defendant’s burden to demonstrate that the existence of jurisdiction would
be unreasonable.” (Buchanan v. Soto (2015) 241 Cal.App.4th 1353, 1362.)
 
California’s long-arm statute grants its courts the power to assert
personal jurisdiction over out-of-state parties to the maximum extent that the
state and federal constitutions allow. (Code Civ. Proc., § 410.10.) Under the
due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States
Constitution, state courts may exercise personal jurisdiction over nonresidents
who have “minimum contacts” with the forum state. (International Shoe Co. v.
Washington (1945) 326 U.S. 310, 316.) Minimum contacts exist when the
relationship between the nonresident and the forum state is such that the
exercise of jurisdiction does not offend “traditional notions of fair play and
substantial justice.” (Id. at p. 316.) The primary focus of the personal
jurisdiction inquiry is the relationship of the defendant to the forum state. (Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co. v. Superior Court of California, San Francisco County (2017)
582 U.S. 255 (hereafter Bristol-Myers).) 
 
“Minimum contacts exist where the defendant’s conduct in the forum
state is such that he should reasonably anticipate being subject to suit there,
and it is reasonable and fair to force him to do so.” (F. Hoffman-La Roche,
Ltd. v. Superior Court (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 782, 795, citing World–Wide
Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson (1980) 444 U.S. 286, 297; Kulko v.
California Superior Court (1978) 436 U.S. 84, 92; Pavlovich v. Superior
Court (2002) 29 Cal.4th 262, 269.) 
 
Personal jurisdiction may be either general or specific. General (also
called all-purpose) jurisdiction means that a defendant's contacts with a state
are sufficiently extensive that the “defendant is ‘essentially at home,’ ” and
the court may exercise jurisdiction over the defendant regardless of whether
the claims relate to the forum state.  (Ford
Motor Company v. Montana Eighth Judicial District Court (2021) 141
S.Ct. 1017, 1024; Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S. A. v. Brown
(2011) 564 U.S. 915, 919.) 
 

Specific personal jurisdiction hinges on the “ ‘relationship among the
defendant, the forum, and the litigation.’ ” (Daimler AG v. Bauman (2014)
571 U.S.117, 133; accord Walden v. Fiore (2014) 571 U.S. 277, 284.)  Such jurisdiction requires “ ‘an affiliation
between the forum and the underlying controversy, principally, [an] activity or
an occurrence that takes place in the forum State and is therefore subject to
the State’s regulation.’ ” (Bristol-Myers, supra, 582 U.S. at p. 262.)
Consistent with the constraints of due process, “the defendant’s suit-related
conduct must create a substantial connection with the forum State.” (Walden
v. Fiore, supra, 571 U.S. at p. 284.) 
 
Further, “a nonresident defendant may be subject to the court's
specific jurisdiction if three requirements are met: (1) the defendant has
purposefully availed itself of forum benefits with respect to the matter in
controversy; (2) the controversy is related to or arises out of the defendant's
contacts with the forum; and (3) the exercise of jurisdiction would be
reasonable and comports with fair play and substantial justice.”  (ViaView, supra, 1 Cal.App.5th at p.
216.)
 
ANALYSIS
 
Cook challenges personal jurisdiction on the basis that, although she
used to be a resident of California, she has resided in Costa Rica since 2017, and
the incident in question occurred in Costa Rica.  (See Cook Dec., ¶¶ 8, 11-16.)  
 
In Opposition, the only evidence Plaintiff references are exhibits
attached to a Request for Judicial Notice made in opposition to Cook’s
concurrent motion to stay or dismiss for inconvenient forum.  As discussed above, the Court takes judicial
notice of the California Secretary of State and the Michigan Department of
Licensing and Regulatory Affairs public corporate information page for Mauser
Harmony.  These pages indicate that Mauser
Harmony maintains a mailing address in Van Nuys, California, and that the
address for each of Mauser Harmony’s principals, including Defendant Cook, is
in Van Nuys, California.  (RJN Exhs. 2,
4.)[2]  
 
The Court finds this evidence insufficient to rebut the Cook
declaration, indicating that Cook’s parents and brother reside in California,
but Mauser Harmony’s principal place of business is in Costa Rica, and Ms. Cook
resides in Costa Rica, that Mauser Harmony does not maintain any offices in
California or conduct any business in California.  Therefore, the Court does not find either Cook’s
contacts with California to be so continuous and systematic for her to be
“essentially at home” in California to establish general jurisdiction.
 
With respect to specific jurisdiction, “A nonresident defendant may be
subject to the court's specific jurisdiction if three requirements are met: (1)
the defendant has purposefully availed itself of forum benefits with respect to
the matter in controversy; (2) the controversy is related to or arises out of
the defendant's contacts with the forum; and (3) the exercise of jurisdiction
would be reasonable and comports with fair play and substantial justice.”  (ViaView, supra, 1 Cal.App.5th at p. 216.)
 
The Court does not find any of these three prongs satisfied.  Cook does not do business in California or target
services to California residents.  Thus, Cook
has not purposefully availed herself of California benefits with respect to the
matter in controversy.  
 
To the extent Mauser Harmony has availed itself of California benefits
by virtue of registering to do business as a foreign entity, Plaintiff does not
establish how such registration would create personal jurisdiction over
Cook.  Moreover, the controversy at issue
does not arise from Mauser Harmony’s registration to do business, or from
Mauser Harmony’s business affairs, if any, in California.  In short, Plaintiff has not demonstrated that
the incident arose from this California registration or any business either
Mauser Harmony or Cook conducted in or directed toward California.
 
Thus, exercising jurisdiction over Cook, a resident of Costa Rica,
over an incident that occurred in Costa Rica, would not comport with fair play
and substantial justice, notwithstanding that some of Mauser Harmony’s other
principals apparently reside in California.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
            For the reasons stated, the Court
grants Specially Appearing Defendant Cook’s Motion to Quash.  
 
            The
Clerk of the Court shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling.
