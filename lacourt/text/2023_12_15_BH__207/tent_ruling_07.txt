[1] The Court declines to consider the reply declarations
of Won M. Park or Heather Marie Cook.  In
general, a reply cannot contain new evidence because it violates the moving
party’s right to due process.  (See,
e.g., San Diego Watercrafts, Inc. v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2002) 102
Cal.App.4th 308, 315 [“Where a remedy as
drastic as summary judgment is involved, due process requires a party be fully
advised of the issues to be addressed and be given adequate notice of what
facts it must rebut in order to prevail”]; see also Wall Street Network Ltd.
v. New York Times Co. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1171.)


[2] On a motion to stay or dismiss for
inconvenient forum, the moving party bears the burden to produce sufficient
evidence to enable the court to consider all relevant factors. (See National
Football League v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 902,
926-927.)
