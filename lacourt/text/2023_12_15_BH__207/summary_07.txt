And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case where the defendant has moved to stay or dismiss the action due to an inconvenient forum, and has also moved for summary judgment. The judge declines to consider the reply declarations of Won M. Park and Heather Marie Cook, as they contain new evidence and violate the moving party's right to due process. The judge notes that under California law, a party seeking summary judgment must provide sufficient evidence to enable the court to consider all relevant factors. The judge will consider the evidence and arguments presented by the parties and will issue a final ruling after today's hearing.
