significant statements:
  - "A defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time to plead or within any further time that the court may for good cause allow, may serve and file a notice of motion for one or more of the following purposes: (1) To quash service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her."
  - "Minimum contacts exist where the defendant's conduct in the forum state is such that he should reasonably anticipate being subject to suit there, and it is reasonable and fair to force him to do so."
  - "The primary focus of the personal jurisdiction inquiry is the relationship of the defendant to the forum state."
  - "A nonresident defendant may be subject to the court's specific jurisdiction if three requirements are met: (1) the defendant has purposefully availed itself of forum benefits with respect to the matter in controversy; (2) the controversy is related to or arises out of the defendant's contacts with the forum; and (3) the exercise of jurisdiction would be reasonable and comports with fair play and substantial justice."

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion to quash service of summons filed by Mauser Harmony with Nature Foundation, Inc. (Defendant) and has decided to grant the motion. The court finds that the Defendant, a Michigan corporation with its principal place of business in Costa Rica, does not have sufficient contacts with California to establish personal jurisdiction over it. The court notes that the Defendant has registered as a foreign business in California, but has not conducted any business in California and has not targeted its services to California residents. The court also finds that the controversy at issue does not arise from the Defendant's registration to do business in California or from any business the Defendant conducted in or directed toward California. Therefore, the court concludes that exercising jurisdiction over the Defendant would not be reasonable and would not comport with fair play and substantial justice.
