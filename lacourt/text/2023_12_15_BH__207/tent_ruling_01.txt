MOTION
 
            Plaintiff Tent 123 (“Plaintiff”) filed
an unlawful detainer complaint in this action on October 4, 2022.  Defendant Fethi Sahman (“Defendant”) vacated
the premises in December 2022.  As such,
possession of the subject property is not at issue.  Plaintiff now moves for leave to file a first
amended complaint for damages only.  Defendant
has not opposed the motion for leave to amend. 

 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Amendments
to Pleadings: General Provisions
 
            Under Code of Civil Procedure
section 473, subdivision (a)(1), “The court may, in furtherance of justice, and
on any terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading or
proceeding by adding or striking out the name of any party, or by correcting a
mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any other respect; and may,
upon like terms, enlarge the time for answer or demurrer. The court may
likewise, in its discretion, after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon any
terms as may be just, an amendment to any pleading or proceeding in other
particulars; and may upon like terms allow an answer to be made after the time
limited by this code.”
 
            To wit, without notice to the other
party the Court has wide discretion to allow either party (i) to add or strike
the name of a party or (ii) to correct a mistake in the name of a party or a
mistake in any other respect “in furtherance of justice” and “on any terms as
may be proper.” (See Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1); see also Marriage
of Liss (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1429.) Alternatively, after notice to
the other party, the Court has wide discretion to allow either party to amend
pleadings “upon any terms as may be just.” (See Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (a)(1). Similarly, Code of Civil Procedure section 576 states “Any judge,
at any time before or after commencement of trial, in the furtherance of
justice, and upon such terms as may be proper, may allow the amendment of any
pleading or pretrial conference order.”
 
            Judicial policy favors resolution of
all disputed matters between the parties and, therefore, leave to amend is
liberally granted. (Berman vs. Bromberg (1986) 56 Cal.App.4th 936, 945; Hirsa
v. Superior Court (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 486, 488-489 [this has been an
established policy in California since 1901] (citing Frost v. Whitter
(1901) 132 Cal. 421, 424; Thomas v. Bruza (1957) 151 Cal.App.2d 150,
155).) The Court of Appeal in Morgan v. Superior Court held “If the
motion to amend is timely made and the granting of the motion will not
prejudice the opposing party, it is error to refuse permission to amend and
where the refusal also results in a party being deprived of the right to assert
a meritorious cause of action or a meritorious defense, it is not only error
but an abuse of discretion.” (Morgan v. Superior Court (1959) 172
Cal.App.2d 527, 530, citations omitted.) Moreover, “it is an abuse of
discretion for the court to deny leave to amend where the opposing party was
not misled or prejudiced by the amendment.” (Kittredge Sports Co. v.
Superior Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1048 [opposing party did not
establish harm by the delay in moving to amend the complaint].)
 
            “The court may grant leave to amend
the pleadings at any stage of the action.” (Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023) ¶ 6:636 (hereafter
Weil & Brown).) Denial of a motion to amend is rarely justified if the
motion is timely made and granting the motion will not prejudice the opposing
party. (Id. at ¶ 6:639, citations omitted.) However, if the party
seeking the amendment has been dilatory, and the delay has prejudiced the
opposing party, the judge has discretion to deny leave to amend. (Id. at
¶ 6:655, citations omitted. Absent prejudice, any claimed delay alone is not
grounds for denial. “If the delay in seeking the amendment has not misled or
prejudiced the other side, the liberal policy of allowing amendments prevails.
Indeed, it is an abuse of discretion to deny leave in such a case even if
sought as late as the time of trial. (Id. at ¶ 6:653 (citing Higgins
v. Del Faro (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 558, 564-565).) “Prejudice exists where
the amendment would result in a delay of trial, along with loss of critical
evidence, added costs of preparation, increased burden of discovery, etc. . . .
But the fact that the amendment involves a change in legal theory which would
make admissible evidence damaging to the opposing party is not the kind of
prejudice the court will consider.” (Weil & Brown, supra, at
¶ 6:656, citations omitted.)
 
            “Even if some prejudice is shown,
the judge may still permit the amendment but impose conditions, as the Court is
authorized to grant leave ‘on such terms as may be proper.’” (Weil &
Brown, supra, at ¶ 6:663, citation omitted.) For example, the court
may cause the party seeking the amendment to pay the costs and fees incurred in
preparing for trial. (Id. at ¶ 6:664 (citing Fuller v. Vista Del
Arroyo Hotel, 42 Cal.App.2d 400, 404).)
 
California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1324: Procedural Requirements
 
            Pursuant to California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1324(a), a motion to amend a pleading before trial must:
 
“(1) Include a copy of the proposed amendment or
amended pleadings, which must be serially numbered to differentiate it from
previous pleadings or amendments;
(2) state what allegations in the previous
pleading are proposed to be deleted, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and
line number, the deleted allegations are located; and
(3) State what allegations are proposed to be
added to the previous pleading, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line
number, the additional allegations are located.”
 
            In addition, under Rule 3.1324(b), a
motion to amend a pleading before trial must be accompanied by a separate
declaration that specifies the following:
 
“(1) the effect of the amendment;
(2) why the amendment is necessary and proper;
(3) when the facts giving rise to the amended
allegations were discovered; and
(4) the reasons why the request for amendment was
not made earlier.”
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Here, Plaintiff has attached as
Exhibit A to the motion a copy of the propose amended complaint, and also
provided the declaration of Chris Zaki, which indicates the following:
 
5. Pursuant to Shaman’s Notice of Surrender filed
on November 28, 2022, this Court held that possession was no longer at issue
and this action thereafter converted to an ordinary civil action.
 
[…]
 
8. On March 3, 2023, Tent 123, filed its initial
First Amended Complaint (the “initial FAC”) as to Shaman, erroneously believing
that it was permitted to do so. 
 
9. On August 3, 2023, the Clerk of the Court
determined that Tent 123’s initial FAC was incorrectly accepted for filing on
March 3, 2023. As a result, the initial FAC was revised to being “received” but
not “filed.” 
 
10. On or about August 17, 2023, Tent 123
received this Court’s Notice of Rejection regarding Tent 123’s FAC. 
 
11. On or about August 18, 2023, Tent 123 filed a
Request for Dismissal with the intent of refiling as a civil action alleging
breach of contract however Tent 123’s Request for Dismissal was denied due to
the existence of Shaman’s Cross-Complaint. 
 
12. On or about September 28, 2023, Tent 123
presented a Motion for Leave to Amend the operative Complaint to include both
those damages Tent 123 was not able to recover in a limited summary unlawful
detainer matter as well as to allege additional damages that Tent 123 was not
then aware of at the time the original complaint was filed. Tent 123’s Motion
for Leave to Amend was denied without prejudice.
 
13. This amendment to Tent 123’s Complaint (the
“proposed FAC”) is necessary and proper in order to fully address the entirety
of the scope of Tent 123’s damages that have arisen since the filing of the
original complaint, to include newly-discovered causes of action and damages,
and to prevent multiplicity of actions, thereby reducing the potential overall
burden that multiple actions will cause to this Court and the parties herein.
Leave to amend is further necessary by the virtue of Shaman having filed an
Answer to the original complaint.
 
14. The proposed FAC includes additional monetary
damages not otherwise recoverable in an unlawful detainer based upon Cal. Code
Civ. Proc., §1161(2). In addition to including a cause of action for breach of
contract, Tent 123 seeks the entire balance of Shaman’s unpaid rent, commencing
with Shaman’s initial default in November 2020 and through to Shaman’s vacating
the Premises, notwithstanding the cost of remediating the significant property
damage Shaman caused which was then unknown as of the filing of the original
complaint in an amount no less than $110,350.00 and subject to proof at trial.
 
15. Had Tent 123 been made aware that the initial
FAC was not accepted and filed by the Clerk, Tent 123 would have applied to
this Court in or around March 2023 for leave to amend the operative complaint. 
 
16. While there is a Trial Setting Conference
pending on December 1, 2023, a trial date in this matter has yet to be set.
Shaman has yet to conduct any discovery in this action to date. Having the
entirety of the damages addressed in a single action, as opposed to two, will
streamline this litigation and conserve the parties’ and this Court’s valuable
resources. Shaman will suffer no prejudice by permitting Tent 123 to amend the
operative complaint to include all relevant damages Tent 123 has incurred.
 
(Zaki
Decl. ¶¶ 5, 8-15.)  
 
            Thus, the Court finds that the
Motion satisfies both the procedural and substantive requirements of Rule
3.1324.  
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
            Therefore, the Court grants
Plaintiff’s unopposed motion for leave to amend the complaint.  Plaintiff shall file and serve the proposed
first amended complaint on or before January 12, 2024.
 
            Further, the Court orders Plaintiff
to provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof of service of such.
