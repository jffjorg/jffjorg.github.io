And here is the summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration of the Court's order granting defendant's motion to dismiss the case. The Plaintiffs contend that the 5-year deadline to bring the action to trial was extended due to bankruptcy stays, but the Court finds that the Plaintiffs' failure to bring the action to trial within the 5-year deadline was not excused by the bankruptcy stays. The Court also finds that the Plaintiffs' contention that the 5-year deadline was extended by 27 months and 15 days by virtue of the automatic bankruptcy stays is incorrect, as the actual duration of the bankruptcy stays was only 330 days. The Court concludes that the oral stipulations to extend the 5-year deadline were necessary, both because the Court was not previously provided information regarding the exact duration of the bankruptcy stays, and because the deadline had passed in any event.
