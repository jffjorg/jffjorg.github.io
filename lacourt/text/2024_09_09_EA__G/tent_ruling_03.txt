Review
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Petitioner Dean Himbler Aviles’s Petition for Judicial
Review is DENIED with prejudice.
BACKGROUND
On July 17, 2024, Petitioner
Dean Himbler Aviles filed a petition for judicial review that seeks to charge Respondent
Maria Yesenia Valenzuela for one count of violating Penal Code section 278.5.
A hearing on the present
petition is set for September 9, 2024.
ANALYSIS
In a
petition brought pursuant to Penal Code section 951, Aviles alleges Valenzuela
has committed a criminal violation of Penal Code section 278.5. For the
following reasons, the court DENIES Aviles’s petition with prejudice.
In
California, “[t]he parties to a criminal action are the People, in whose
sovereign name it is prosecuted, and the person accused [Citations]; the victim of the crime is not a party [Citation]. The prosecution of
criminal offenses on behalf of the People is the sole responsibility of the
public prosecutor. [Citations.] The prosecutor ordinarily has sole discretion
to determine whom to charge, what charges to file and pursue, and what
punishment to seek. [Citations.] No private citizen, however personally aggrieved,
may institute criminal proceedings independently [Citation] and the
prosecutor's own discretion is not subject to judicial control at the behest of
persons other than the accused.” (Dix v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d
442, 451.)
Here,
Aviles, a private citizen, lacks the authority to initiate criminal
prosecutions and/or proceedings pursuant to California law. Accordingly, Aviles’s
petition is DENIED with prejudice.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Aviles’s
petition is DENIED with prejudice.
