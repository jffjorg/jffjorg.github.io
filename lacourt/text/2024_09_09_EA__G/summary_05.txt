And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiff's application for default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff, Clean Energy Solutions, Inc., seeks to hold Alberto Garcia and California Clean Energy Solutions, LLC (CCES) liable for damages resulting from a tortious interference with business. The defendants allegedly registered a website domain name and used the plaintiff's business information to launch a telemarketing campaign, which misled the plaintiff's potential customers. The plaintiff filed a complaint and served the defendants, and the court entered default against both defendants. The plaintiff then filed an application for default judgment in the amount of $295,448.90. However, the judge denies the application because the plaintiff's complaint does not specify a specific amount of damages, only requesting "damages according to proof." The judge notes that a party may not obtain damages in a default judgment that exceed the amount requested in the complaint, and that the complaint does not apprise the defendants of their maximum liability. The judge will entertain a motion by the plaintiff for leave to amend the complaint.
