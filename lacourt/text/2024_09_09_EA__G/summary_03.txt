And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies Dean Himbler Aviles's petition for judicial review, seeking to charge Maria Yesenia Valenzuela for violating Penal Code section 278.5. The court finds that as a private citizen, Aviles lacks the authority to initiate criminal proceedings, and that the prosecution of criminal offenses is the sole responsibility of the public prosecutor. The court cites Dix v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 442, 451, stating that no private citizen may institute criminal proceedings independently, and that the prosecutor's discretion is not subject to judicial control at the behest of persons other than the accused. The petition is denied with prejudice.
