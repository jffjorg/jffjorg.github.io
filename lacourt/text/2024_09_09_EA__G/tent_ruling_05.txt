for Default Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Clean Energy Solutions, Inc.’s Application
for Default Judgment is DENIED without
prejudice.

motion by Plaintiff for leave to amend the Complaint.
BACKGROUND
This
is an action based on tortious interference with business. In February 2023,
Defendants Alberto Garcia and California Clean Energy Solutions, LLC (CCES) allegedly
registered the website domain name of “cleanenergysolution.org.” Plaintiff
Clean Energy Solutions, Inc. (CES) alleges Garcia and CCES used CES’s business
type, business name, and contact information for the website with the purpose
of misleading CES’s potential customers. In August 2023, Garcia and CCES
allegedly began a telemarketing campaign that marketed solar energy products and
used CES’s name to do so. As a result, recipients of the calls began to
complain to CES and post negative reviews of CES online.
On February
27, 2024, CES filed a complaint against Garcia, CCES, and Does 1-10, alleging
the following causes of action: (1) violation of Business and Professions Code
section 17525, (2) intentional interference with prospective economic
advantage, (3) negligent interference with prospective economic advantage, (4)
intentional interference with contract, (5) negligent interference with
contract, (6) violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200, and (7)
unjust enrichment. On March 1, 2024, CES’s process server personally served
CCES in Glendale. On March 5, 2024, CES’s process server personally served
Garcia in Pittsburg.
On April
4, 2024, the court entered default against CCES after they failed to file a
timely answer. On April 5, 2024, the court entered default against Garcia after
Garcia also failed to file a timely answer. On August 30, 2024, CES submitted
the present application for default judgment.
An
OSC Re: Default Judgment is set for September 9, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
CES
seeks default judgment against Garcia and CCES in the total amount of $295,448.90,
including $280,250.00 in damages, $14,204.45 in interest, and $994.45 in costs.¿For
the following reasons, the court DENIES CES’s application without
prejudice.
A
party may not obtain damages in a default judgment that exceed the amount
requested in the complaint. (Greenup v. Rodman (1986) 42 Cal.3d 822,
826.) In determining the maximum amount of damages allowable, “courts must look
to the prayer of the complaint¿or¿to ‘allegations in the body of the
complaint of the damages sought’ to determine whether a defendant has been
informed of the ‘maximum liability’ he or she will face for choosing to
default.” (People ex rel. Lockyer v. Brar (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 659, 667,
quoting National Diversified Services, Inc. v. Bernstein (1985) 168
Cal.App.3d 410, 417-418.) Allegations “according to proof” are insufficient in
a default judgment proceeding as they do not inform defendants of their maximum
liability. (Yu v. Liberty Surplus Ins. Corp. (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 1024,
1032.)
Here,
the prayer of CES’s Complaint requests damages “according to proof” and does
not provide a specific amount. (Complaint, ¶ 5-7.) Nor do the allegations of
the Complaint provide any such number. Because the Complaint does not apprise
defendants of the maximum amount of liability they face, the court cannot grant
CES’s request for default judgment.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, CES’s
application for default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.  The court will entertain a motion by
Plaintiff for leave to amend the Complaint.
