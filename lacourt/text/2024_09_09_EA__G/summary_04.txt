The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Katon Dominguez v. Southern California Permanente Medical Group, Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, and Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. The petition filed by Dominguez to enforce access to his medical records under Evidence Code section 1158 is deemed moot as the subject records were produced. The judge has granted Dominguez's request for sanctions against SCPMG in the amount of $1,222.50, payable within thirty days of the issuance of the order. The judge found that SCPMG failed to comply with Dominguez's request for medical records and failed to provide the records in a timely manner, despite promising to do so on several occasions. The judge also found that SCPMG acted without substantial justification and that the imposition of sanctions is warranted.
