And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of granting the motions to quash the subpoenas for employment records served on Soapbox Films, LLC and Lucasfilm, Ltd., LLC, by Plaintiffs Brooke Stone and Jackie Stone. The judge found that the subpoenas were overly broad and lacked specific facts to justify production of the requested documents, and that the plaintiffs have a legal protected privacy interest in their employment records and an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy. The judge noted that the requested documents, which include personnel files, employment contracts, and performance evaluations, are not relevant to the lawsuit and that the plaintiffs' privacy rights outweigh any potential benefit to the defendants in producing the documents.
