LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.¿¿
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284,¿subd. (b).)¿ An attorney is permitted to withdraw
where conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue
the representation.¿ (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).)¿ “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v. Superior Court¿(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128,
1133.)¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of Court
3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court 3.1362(c)), and MC-053
(Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court 3.1362(e)).¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case.¿ (Cal. Rules of Court
3.1362(d).)¿ The court may delay effective date of the order relieving counsel
until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has been
filed with the court.¿ (Cal. Rules of Court 3.1362(e).)¿¿ 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Counsel Abbasi moves to be relieved because of breakdown in
communication with the client and failure to pay for incurred legal fees and
costs. (Attorney Declaration In Support of Motion to be Relieved as Counsel.) Counsel
Abbasi confirmed the client’s address by conversation within the last 30 days
from filing the motion. (Id.) Counsel
Abbasi complied with the requirements of CRC, rule 3.1362.
 
Accordingly,
the court GRANTS the motion to be relieved as counsel.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel is GRANTED effective upon filing a valid proof of service with the
order with this court.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
