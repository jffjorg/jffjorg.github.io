[1] Due to the numerous filings in this case, the
procedural background is shortened. 
 


[2] Plaintiffs’ TAC is not comprised of paragraphs but
rather is in narrative format.  


[3] The TAC alleged two additional COAs against
Defendant: 2nd COA for Civil Conspiracy (TAC p. 16) and 9th
COA for Fraud By Intentional Concealment (TAC p. 36). However, according to the
4/17/23 minute order, the court sustained without leave to amend Defendant’s
demurrer as to Plaintiff’s 2nd and 9th COAs; thus,
leaving only the 1st COA.  


[4] Defendant’s primary case citation is to Doe v.
Lawndale Elementary School District (2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 113, 138-139, but
the court agrees with Plaintiff that the case is inapposite. In Doe, the
court found no evidence that any school district employee knew facts from which
a reasonable person in a like position would have suspected that middle
school's music instructor had sexually abused a student. Thus, the district was
not liable to the student for breach of duty to report suspected abuse under
CANRA, even if other students witnessed the instructor's conduct towards the
student. But sexual misconduct (involving oral copulation and genital
touching), unlike physical misconduct (bruising), cannot be readily
observed. 


[5] For example in Reyes, the appellate court
determined that the trial court properly excluded a psychiatrist’s opinion
because the psychiatrist formed his opinion based of a diagnoses from another
psychiatrist from 20 years ago such that the People had no opportunity to
cross-examine the initial psychiatrist. (Reyes, supra, 12 Cal.3d at pp.
502-503.) Here, however, Dr. Sison is not making a medical opinion
about Plaintiff’s psychiatric condition based upon another psychiatrist’s
diagnoses.  


[6] The court requests Defendant file a proposed order.
