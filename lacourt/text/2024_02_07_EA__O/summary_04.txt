And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling regarding a future court hearing. The plaintiff filed a complaint stating that they were rear-ended, but did not specify any physical injuries. The defendant filed two identical motions, which were met with minimal opposition. The judge notes that the parties have engaged in meet and confer efforts, resulting in the defendant agreeing to modify the subpoena served on Kaiser to limit the time frame to 10 years prior to the incident. The judge is concerned that the reply to the motions does not address the causation element of the case. Overall, the judge is seeking a more robust analysis of the issues at hand.
