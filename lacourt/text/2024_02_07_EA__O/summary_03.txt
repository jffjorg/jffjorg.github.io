```

And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the motion to quash deposition subpoenas for production of business records is pending because the extent of Plaintiff's claimed injuries is unclear. The Judge notes that both parties have cited to Britt v. Superior Court (1978) 20 Cal.3d 844, which established the patient-litigant exception to the physician-patient and psychotherapist-patient privilege. However, the Judge cannot resolve what is relevant medical information because the parties have differing accounts of Plaintiff's claimed injuries. The Judge declines to impose sanctions on either party and will entertain requests to continue for supplemental briefing.
