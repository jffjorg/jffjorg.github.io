And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling provides a brief background on the case, including the procedural history and the allegations made by the plaintiff. The judge notes that the plaintiff's complaint is in narrative format, rather than paragraphs, and that the defendant's demurrer was sustained as to two additional claims. The judge also addresses the relevance of case citations, specifically Doe v. Lawndale Elementary School District, and determines that the case is inapposite. The judge also discusses the relevance of a medical opinion provided by Dr. Sison, determining that it is based on his own diagnoses and not on a diagnosis from another psychiatrist. Finally, the judge requests that the defendant file a proposed order.
