Background
Plaintiff Fire Guard
Corporation dba Builtright Engineering and Construction filed this action on
May 11, 2021 against defendants Stanford and 12th Street, LP, Shu C. Kou, and
Shan C. Kou, alleging causes of action for (1) Breach of Contract; (2) Open Book
Account; (3) Account Stated; (4) Quantum Meruit; and (5) Foreclosure of
Mechanic’s Lien. The Complaint alleges that Plaintiff rendered services and
furnished certain materials within the last four years to Defendants at their
request, pursuant to the parties’ written contract, including change orders, to
be used in the construction located at 901 East 12th Street, Los Angeles, CA
90021. (Compl., ¶¶ 5, 9.) Defendants allegedly breached the terms and
conditions of said contract by failing to pay the agreed upon consideration. (Id.
at ¶ 12.)
Defendants Shu C. Kou and
Shan C. Kou filed a Cross-Complaint on July 7, 2021 against Stanford and 12th
Street, LP, Mayer Separzadeh, and Shahin S. Zackary, alleging causes of action
for (1) Implied Contractual Indemnity; (2) Express Contractual Indemnity; (3)
Breach of Lease; (4) Breach of Guaranty; and (5) Account Stated.
On August 15, 2023, Cross-Defendant Mayer Separzadeh
(“Cross-Defendant”) filed the instant (1) Motion to Compel Response of
Cross-Complainant Shan C. Kou to Requests for Production, Set One; and Requests
for Sanctions for $3,310; and (2) Motion to Compel Response of
Cross-Complainant Shu C. Kou to Requests for Production, Set One; and Requests
for Sanctions for $3,310.
On March
6, 2024, Cross-Complainants Shu C. Kou and
Shan C. Kou filed a consolidated opposition. 
On April 23, 2024, Cross-Defendant Separzadeh filed
separate replies.
Legal Standard
A party must respond to a request for production of documents within 30
days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a).) If a party to
whom requests for production of documents is directed does not provide timely
responses, the requesting party may move for an order compelling responses to
the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) The party also waives
the right to make any objections, including one based on privilege or
work-product protection. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) A motion to compel responses is not subject to a 45–day time limit, and the
propounding party does not have to demonstrate either good cause or that it
satisfied a ‘meet and confer’ requirement.”¿ (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.)¿
Also, “[a] separate statement is not required when no response has been
provided to the request for discovery.”¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b).) 
 
Courts shall impose a
monetary sanction against any party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection unless the party acted
with substantial justification or other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subd. (c).) 
Discussion 
            On
April 18, 2023, Cross-Defendant’s counsel served,
along with other discovery, Requests for Production of Documents, Set One on Cross-Complainants
Shu C. Kou and Shan C. Kou (“Cross-Complainants”), via electronic mail service
and by fax on their attorney. (Declarations of Shab D. Kerendian ¶ 2; Ex. “A.”) Although these requests were served
on Cross-Complainants’ counsel of record, Cross-Complainants have failed to
provide verified responses to said discovery requests. (Kerendian Decl. ¶¶ 3-4; Ex. “B.”) As
of the date of Cross-Defendant’s
counsel’s declaration, no verified responses have been received. (Kerendian
Decl. ¶ 8.) 
Cross-Defendant requests $3,310 in
monetary sanctions for each of the two motions against Cross-Complainants and
their counsel of record. This represents 2 hours incurred in making the motion,
1 hour to review opposition and prepare reply, 4 hours to prepare and attend
hearing (divided by three motions for), all at the hourly rate of $750, plus
$60 filing fee. (Kerendian Decl. ¶ 16.) 
            In a consolidated opposition,
Cross-Complainants argue that nearly identical discovery has been provided to
Cross-Defendant in a related action, and the imposition of sanctions are not
warranted due to Cross-Complainants’ age and health problems. 
            The Court finds that because
verified responses have not been served in this action, the motions to compel
are granted. Further, the Court finds sanctions are warranted because
Cross-Complainants have failed to respond. However, the amount requested is
excessive due to the simplicity of the motions at issue. Therefore, the Court
awards sanctions in the amount of $810, representing 1 hour incurred at the
hourly rate of $750, plus $60 filing fee. 
            Based on the foregoing: 
Motion
to Compel Response of Cross-Complainant Shan C. Kou to Requests for Production,
Set One is GRANTED. Requests for Sanctions is GRANTED in the reduced amount of
$810.  
Motion
to Compel Response of Cross-Complainant Shu C. Kou to Requests for Production,
Set One is GRANTED. Requests for Sanctions is GRANTED in the reduced amount of
$810. 
            Cross-Complaints shall provide verified responses,
without objection, within 20 days of the date of this order. 
            Cross-Complainants and their counsel of record shall pay
monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,620 to counsel for Cross-Defendant,
within 20 days of the date of this order. 
It is so ordered.
