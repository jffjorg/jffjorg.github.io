And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion of Counsel, Rebecca Aragon and Jacob Krall of Littler Mendelson, to be relieved as counsel for defendant Skinny Labs, Inc. The court has discretion to grant or deny the motion, and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. Counsel has failed to comply with California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362, and has not served the proposed order on all parties. However, the court finds that Counsel's failure to pay fees and costs to Littler Mendelson is a proper basis for withdrawal. Additionally, the next hearing is an OSC: Re Status of Bankruptcy, and there is no reason to believe that Counsel's withdrawal will prejudice the defendant. Therefore, the court grants Counsel's motion to be relieved as counsel on the condition that Counsel corrects the deficiencies in the proposed order.
