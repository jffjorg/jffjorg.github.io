Here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling issued by a judge on December 5, 2024, regarding a case between Quinton A. Sales (Plaintiff) and Equinox Holdings, Inc., et al. (Defendants). The judge is considering a demurrer filed by the defendants to the complaint, which alleges claims for sexual harassment, retaliation, and related claims under California Government Code § 12940, breach of contract, and a tort claim for negligent hiring, supervision, training, and retention.

The judge sustains the demurrer to the FEHA claims in the first and fourth causes of action because the allegations do not establish an employment relationship between the parties, which is a fundamental foundation for FEHA liability.

However, the judge overrules the demurrer to the third cause of action, which alleges sexual harassment in violation of Civil Code § 51.9. The judge finds that a reasonable inference can be drawn that the alleged facts support the type of relationship covered by the statute.

The judge orders the plaintiff to file a first amended complaint within 10 days and strikes the amended complaint filed on November 21, 2024.
