[TENTATIVE]
ORDER SUSTAINING DEMURRER TO PLAINTIFF’S FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT WITHOUT LEAVE
TO AMEND
 
                                                                                        
I.        
BACKGROUND
The first amended complaint alleges that Defendants
employed Plaintiff as a receptionist for nearly 21 years. Plaintiff alleges
that Defendants engaged in harassing and discriminating conduct and retaliated
against  Plaintiff and ultimately
terminated her employment when she was 45 years old. Plaintiff alleges six
causes of action for discrimination, harassment, retaliation, and related
claims in violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act (“FEHA”), and a tort
claim for wrongful termination. 
                                                                                         
II.       
ARGUMENTS
Defendant, Air Tiger Express (USA), Inc. (“Defendant”)
demurs to the sixth cause of action for wrongful termination in violation of
public policy on grounds the claim is barred by the two-year statute of
limitations. (Code Civ. Proc., § 335.1.)
Plaintiff argues that the claim is not barred by the
statute of limitations. The principle cited by Defendant is in conflict with another
opinion which this court should follow. Alternatively, the doctrine of
equitable tolling applies as Plaintiff had several legal remedies, and
reasonably pursued one of those remedies in good faith. 
In reply, Defendant argues that the court sustained
Defendant’s demurrer to the complaint on this issue, and Plaintiff has not
alleged new facts to avoid the statute of limitations bar. Plaintiff is
improperly re-arguing issues already adjudicated by this court. 
                                                                                 
III.      
LEGAL STANDARDS
A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a complaint as a
matter of law and raises only questions of law. (Schmidt v. Foundation Health
(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706.) In testing the complaint’s sufficiency, the
court must assume the truth of the properly pleaded factual allegations as well
as facts that can be reasonably inferred from those expressly pleaded facts.
The court may also consider matters properly subject to judicial notice. (Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)
Sufficient facts are the essential facts of the case
"with reasonable precision and with particularity that is sufficiently
specific to acquaint the defendant with the nature, source, and extent of his
cause of action.” (Gressley v. Williams (1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636,
643-644.)  Whether the Plaintiff will be
able to prove the pleaded facts is irrelevant. (Stevens v. Superior Court
(1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 605, 609–610.) 
A demurrer may also be sustained if a complaint is
“uncertain.” Uncertainty exists where a complaint’s factual allegations are so
confusing, they do not sufficiently apprise a defendant of the issues it is
being asked to meet. (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185
Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2; Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10(f).)
A pleading is required to assert general allegations of
ultimate fact. Evidentiary facts are not required. (Quelimane Co. v. Stewart
Title Guaranty Co. (1998) 19 Cal. 4th 26, 47; Lim v. The.TV Corp. Internat.
(2002) 99 Cal. App. 4th 684, 690.) However, unlike federal courts, California
state courts are not a notice pleading jurisdiction, and notice alone is not a
sufficient basis for any pleading. California is a fact pleading jurisdiction.
Merely putting an opposing party on notice is not sufficient. (Bach v. County
of Butte (1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 554, 561; see Diodes, Inc. v. Franzen (1968) 260
Cal.App.2d 244, 250.)

DISCUSSION
A.     The
Court’s Order sustaining demurrer to Plaintiff’s complaint.
On May 17, 2024, the Hon. Anne Richardson heard
Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s complaint, and in relevant part, sustained
Defendant’s demurrer to the fifth cause of action for wrongful termination in
violation of public policy on grounds it was barred by the statute of
limitations having been filed more than two years from the date of accrual,
which is the date of the alleged termination. 
(M.O.
5/17/24, p.7.) The court acknowledged the perceived
conflicts between Prue
v. Brady Co./San Diego, Inc. (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1367
cited
by Defendant, and  and Acuna
v. San Diego Gas & Electric Co. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th
1402
on which Plaintiff relies relative to the statute of limitations on the
wrongful termination claim. Judge Richardson determined that the two-year
statute of limitations applied to bar Plaintiff’s wrongful termination claim,
as articulated by Prue. However, the court allowed leave to amend in the
event Plaintiff could allege additional facts to avoid the statute of
limitations. (M.O.
5/17/24, p. 9.)
B.    
The
statute of limitations on a claim for wrongful termination in violation of
public policy is two years.
 
Defendant relies on Prue
which
determined that the two-year statute of limitations applicable to claims for
personal injury governed because the primary nature sued upon was personal. (Prue
at
1382.)
Plaintiff contends that because her common law tort claim is based on policy set
forth under FEHA, the tort claim was “tethered” to the FEHA claims such that
the limitations period applicable to the statutory claim governs. 
In the first instance, Plaintiff is articulating the same
argument made in opposition to Defendant’s demurrer to the complaint, and which
Judge Richardson already rejected. Here, Plaintiff continues to urge the court
that it should adopt the “tethering” principle applied in Acuna to avoid
the two-year statute of limitations.  Judge
Richardson allowed leave to amend to add additional facts that would otherwise
affect the two-year statute of limitations. Plaintiff does not discuss any new
facts that would warrant a different outcome. 
Judge Richardson concluded that Prue more
accurately articulated the applicable statute of limitations for a common law
wrongful termination claim. (M.O. 5/17/24; Prue
v. Brady Co./San Diego, Inc. (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th
1367, 1382 [two-year limitations period under Code Civ. Proc., §
335.1 applied to the wrongful termination claim.] This principle is supported
by other cases. (Colores
v. Board of Trustees (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 1293, 1320 [“the
statute of limitations begins to run on the date the employment is actually
terminated … .”]; Romano
v. Rockwell Internat., Inc. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 479, 502 [“Tameny
claim accrues at the time of actual termination."]; Barton
v. New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1200,
1209
["Because the primary nature of the right sued upon in a Tameny
wrongful termination action is personal, the trial court in this case correctly
applied the one-year statute of limitations."[1]
The court is bound to adhere to these cases. 
Plaintiff alleges that she was terminated from employment
on March 24, 2020. (Complaint, ¶ 12.) The two-year limitations period expired
on March 24, 2021. Plaintiff commenced this action on October 18, 2023. 
      Plaintiff’s
equitable tolling argument was previously rejected by Judge Richardson because
the two-year statute of limitations had already expired before any
administrative process under the FEHA had been invoked. (M.O. 5/17/24, p. 7.)
                                                                                         
V.       
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Defendant’s demurrer to
Plaintiff’s first amended complaint is SUSTAINED. Plaintiff was previously
given leave to amend to allege facts that would avoid the statute of
limitations. As Plaintiff has not offered any new facts that would warrant a
different outcome, leave to amend is DENIED.  Defendant is ordered to file its answer within
10 days.
