And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendants' motion for an order to show cause re: contempt for the plaintiff's failure to comply with the court's order to remit payment for attorney's fees. The defendants are seeking an order to show cause re: contempt because the plaintiff failed to pay the fees awarded to them in connection with their anti-SLAPP motion, despite being ordered to do so by the court. The judge finds that the defendants have established all the elements necessary to issue an order to show cause, including that the court has jurisdiction to hear the motion and that the plaintiff has willfully disobeyed the court's order. The judge sets an order to show cause re: contempt for December 5, 2024, in Department 40 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
