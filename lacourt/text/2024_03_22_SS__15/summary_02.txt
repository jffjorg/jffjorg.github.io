Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court tentatively grants the motion for summary judgment filed by Zenith Electronics LLC in favor of the defendant. The plaintiffs, John D. Fernandez, Christina M. Fernandez, and Katherine A. Panaqua, claim that Phyllis J. Fernandez was exposed to asbestos from the defendant's products. However, the court finds that the plaintiffs did not present evidence that their father worked with asbestos-containing parts from the defendant. The defendant showed that the plaintiffs do not have and cannot reasonably obtain evidence of exposure to asbestos from the defendant's products. The court concludes that the plaintiffs did not show a disputed issue of material fact, and therefore, the motion is granted. The plaintiffs are ordered to file a proposed judgment within five days.
