```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the motion to reopen expert discovery, citing the necessity and reason for the discovery, as well as the parties' lack of cooperation and professionalism in setting the expert deposition schedule. The judge notes that the parties failed to file timely complete pre-trial documents and that it is unlikely the case will go to trial on the scheduled date. As a result, the trial date is continued to April 29, 2024, and expert discovery is reopened solely to complete expert depositions.
