And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that Jacob O. Partiyeli, the attorney representing plaintiffs Elizabeth Lopez Fabian and Juan Carlos Roman, may withdraw as their counsel. The motion to be relieved as counsel was granted due to the attorney's showing of sufficient reasons for withdrawal and the lack of opposition from any party. The attorney will be relieved of his duties effective upon the filing of proof of service of the signed order granting the motion. The judge has ordered the attorney to notify the clients and other parties of the ruling.
