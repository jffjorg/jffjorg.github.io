  Order RE:
 
order to show cause re the issues of (1)
  leslie bushnell’s durable power of attorney, and (2) steven vahidi’s
  substitution of attorney
 



 
Order to Show Cause (1) Whether the Durable
Power of Attorney Granting Leslie Bushnell the Authority to Act on Defendant
James Jones’s Behalf in Prosecuting or Defending Litigation has Been Revoked or
Determined by a Court to be Invalid and, if not, (2) Whether the Substitution
of Attorney – Civil Form Filed by Steven S. Vadihi on Behalf of Defendant James
Jones Should be Stricken Because Steven S. Vahidi Did Not Have Authority to

The court considered the
following papers filed in connection with the Order to Show Cause: (1) “Defendant
James Jones’ Response to Order to Show Cause re Substitution of Attorney;
Declaration of Steven S. Vahidi in Support Thereof,” filed by Steven S. Vahidi
on behalf of defendant James Jones on November 21, 2024, and (2) “Leslie
Bushnell’s (Agent for Defendant) Reply to Defendant James Jones Response to
Order to Show Cause re Substitution of Attorney,” filed by Leslie Bushnell on
December 9, 2024.
 
DISCUSSION 
On June 13, 2024, the court
issued a minute order stating, inter alia, that it appeared to the court
that (1) at the time the answer to the Complaint was filed on behalf of
defendant James Jones (“Defendant”) in this action, Claudia Moody Jones had
been appointed as conservator of Defendant’s estate, but the answer was not
filed by or on behalf of the conservator and therefore was filed without
authority and is subject to being stricken as improper, and (2) since the
Probate Court issued an order appointing Claudia Moody Jones as conservator,
notice of the Final Status Conference, trial, and other matters in this action
might not have been properly given to Leslie Bushnell (“Bushnell”) on behalf of
Defendant since she might not have been authorized to receive notices in this
action on his behalf.  (June 13, 2024 Minute Order, pp. 2-3.)  Thus,
the court set an Order to Show Cause for hearing on August 7, 2024 (which was
thereafter continued to August 12, 2024), to address those issues.  (June 13, 2024 Minute Order, p. 3.)
On August 12, 2024, the court
issued an order discharging the Orders to Show Cause.  The court noted, based on the evidence
presented in response to the Order to Show Cause, that “it [was] not clear that
Defendant’s answer was filed without authority because . . . Bushnell has (1)
submitted a copy of the Settlement Agreement executed by Bushnell, Defendant,
C. Jones, and N. Jones, in which the parties agreed that Bushnell (or, in the
alternative, N. Jones) would retain the rights and powers assigned to her in
the 2017 Durable Power of Attorney, limited to those necessary to act on behalf
of Defendant in any litigation, and (2) attested, in her declaration, that the
Probate Court approved the Settlement Agreement in Case No. 20STPB00627 on June
17, 2021.”  (Aug. 12, 2024 Order, p. 5:9-17.)
 
At the August 12, 2024 hearing
on the Orders to Show Cause, attorney Steven S. Vahidi (“Vahidi”) appeared,
asserting that Vahidi was representing Defendant.  (Oct. 10, 2024 Order, p. 1:27-28.)  Vahidi claimed that the Durable Power of
Attorney is not valid, while Bushnell claimed that Defendant is not competent
to make decisions about his estate and that she retains authority to act on
Defendant’s behalf.  (Oct. 10, 2024
Order, pp. 1:28-2:3.)  On August 12,
2024, Vahidi filed a “Substitution of Attorney – Civil” form on behalf of
Defendant, stating that Vahidi had substituted in as counsel to represent
Defendant.  (Aug. 12, 2024 MC-050, ¶¶
1-2.)  
Thus, on October 10, 2024, the
court issued an order in which the court stated that “[i]t appears to the court
that Vahidi may not have the authority to represent Defendant in this action
since the Durable Power of Attorney remains in effect with regard to Bushnell’s
authority to act on behalf of Defendant in litigation.”  (Oct. 10, 2024 Order, p. 2:7-9.)  The court also set for hearing on December
13, 2024, an Order to Show Cause (1) whether the Durable Power of Attorney
granting Leslie Bushnell the authority to act on defendant James Jones’s behalf
in prosecuting or defending litigation has been revoked or determined by a
court to be invalid and, if not, (2) whether the Substitution of Attorney –
Civil form filed by Steven S. Vahidi on behalf of defendant James Jones should
be stricken because Steven S. Vahidi did not have authority to sign and file it
on behalf of defendant James Jones. 
(Oct. 10, 2024 Order, p. 2:10-15; Oct. 10, 2024 Minute Order, p. 1.)  The clerk mailed notice of the court’s
October 10, 2024 minute order to Vahidi, counsel for plaintiff Law Firm of Fox
and Fox, Claudia Moody Jones, Defendant, and Bushnell.  (Oct. 10, 2024 Cert. of Mailing.) 
The court finds that
Defendant’s response to the Order to Show Cause, filed by attorney Vahidi, does
not show that Vahidi has the authority to represent Defendant in this
action.  Defendant submitted the
following evidence. 
Defendant executed the
“Durable Power of Attorney for Management of Property and Personal Affairs” on October
30, 2017, in which Defendant appointed Bushnell to be his attorney-in-fact and
granted her the authority to, inter alia, take actions with respect to
any claim that Defendant may have or has been asserted against Defendant with
respect to any legal proceeding.  (Vahidi
Decl., Ex. A, Durable Power of Attorney, ¶¶ 1.A, 2.A, subd. (10).)  On May 28, 2020, Defendant executed a
“Revocation of Durable Power of Attorney,” in which Defendant “revoke[d]” the
Durable Power of Attorney executed on October 30, 2017 and declared that “[a]ll
powers and authorities granted under said power of attorney are hereby
withdrawn and revoked effective immediately.” 
(Vahidi Decl., Ex. B.)  However,
the “Settlement and Mutual Release Agreement,” executed by Bushnell, Nicholas
Jones, Claudia Moody Jones, and Defendant on December 21, 2020 included a
provision in which the parties “agree[d] that the . . . 2020 DPOA Revocation [i.e.,
Defendant’s “Revocation of Durable Power of Attorney”] [is] invalidated upon
the execution of this Agreement by all parties.”  (Vahidi Decl., Ex. C, Settlement, p. 1, § A
[defining “2020 DPOA Revocation” to be the Revocation of Durable Power of
Attorney executed by Defendant on May 28, 2020], p. 5, ¶ 2, subd. (a)(ii).)  Defendant does not dispute that the May 28,
2020 revocation was invalidated pursuant to this agreement.  (Def. Response to Order to Show Cause, p.
4:9-10 [“It is true that the Settlement Agreement in December of 2020 revoked
(at least partially), the May 28, 2020 revocation of Bushnell’s purported DPOA
of 2017”].) 
The court notes that Defendant
has argued that Bushnell’s subsequent breaches of the Settlement Agreement
rendered it void.  However, Defendant has
not cited authority establishing that breaches of that agreement rendered it
“void,” such that Defendant’s Revocation of Durable Power of Attorney still has
legal effect.  (Def. Response to Order to
Show Cause, pp. 4:18-19, 5:16-17.)  The
court further notes that, while Defendant asserts that Bushnell cannot
represent him because he has filed an action against her for elder abuse,
Defendant has not cited authority in support of that contention.  (Def. Response to Order to Show Cause, pp.
5:24-6:3.)  
Finally, Defendant has
submitted correspondence from Vahidi dated February 1, 2024, in which Vahidi told
counsel for Bushnell that Defendant, “in a notarized and acknowledged writing,
has revoked all prior powers of attorneys delegated to date, effectively
immediately.”  (Vahidi Decl., ¶ 5 and Ex.
D, p. 2.)  However, Defendant did not
submit that writing to the court.  Moreover,
the statements from Vahidi regarding Defendant’s purported revocation of the power
of attorney have no legal effect.  (Ibid.)

The court therefore has not
been presented with competent evidence showing that Defendant has revoked the
Durable Power of Attorney authorizing Bushnell to act on his behalf in any
litigation or that the Durable Power of Attorney has been determined by a court
to be invalid.  Thus, it appears that
Vahidi does not have the authority to represent Defendant in this action since
it appears that the Durable Power of Attorney remains in effect with regard to
Bushnell’s authority to act on behalf of Defendant in
litigation.     
Based on the evidence
presented in connection with this Order to Show Cause, the court orders that
the “Substitution of Attorney – Civil” form filed by Steven S. Vahidi on behalf
of defendant James Jones on August 12, 2024 is stricken.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 436.) 
            The court directs Leslie Bushnell to
give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
