The Court finds Plaintiff’s citation to In re Meta Pixel Tax Filing Cases
(N.D. Cal., Mar. 25, 2024 No. 22-cv-07557-PCP) 2024 WL 1251350 unhelpful.  (See Opposition, p. 10.)  There, the district court found the Moore
standard satisfied yet did not identify an allegation demonstrating attempted
or intended participation in a market. 
(See In re Meta Pixel Tax Filing Cases, supra, 2024 WL 1251350,
at *24-*25.)  Moore appears to
require such allegations.
