And here is the English-text summary:

In this tentative ruling, Judge [Not specified] addresses a motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories (SI) propounded by Plaintiff Miguel Hernandez against Defendant General Motors, LLC (GM). The SIs seek information about the individuals who repaired the subject vehicle, documents involved in the investigation, number of repairs, and how Technical Service Bulletins (TSBs) are superseded. The judge denies the motion as to certain SIs where an appropriate reference to documents was made, grants the motion as to other SIs where the objections lack merit, and grants the motion as to other SIs where the responses are evasive. The judge orders GM to provide further responses within 30 days and encourages counsel to use LACourtConnect rather than appearing in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
