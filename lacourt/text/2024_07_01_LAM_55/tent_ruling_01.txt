Motion To Compel Further [sic] Responses, Without Objections, To Form
Interrogatories-General (Set One); Form Interrogatories-Employment Law (Set

BACKGROUND
DANIELLE GREENLIN (“Plaintiff”) filed this wage and
hour and FEHA case against UTR MANAGEMENT, LLC and ICE KREAM, LLC.  
Plaintiff filed a motion requesting an order
compelling Defendant UTR MANAGEMENT, LLC (“Defendant”) to serve initial (not
further) verified responses, without objections, to Form Interrogatories-General
(Set One), Form Interrogatories-Employment Law, and Request for Production of
Documents (Set One) and awarding monetary sanctions against Defendants in the
sum of $1,125.00. Defendant did not file an opposition to the motion.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
A motion to compel initial discovery responses need
only show that discovery was properly served on the opposing party, the time to
respond expired, and no response was served. Leach v. Superior Court
(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905-906; Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290 (compelling
initial interrogatory responses), 
2031.300 (compelling initial document requests).
A motion to compel initial discovery responses need
not show good cause, meeting and conferring, or timely filing, and need not be
accompanied by a separate statement. Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.
Pac. Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.
“If the party seeking a monetary sanction meets its
burden of proof, the burden shifts to the opposing party attempting to avoid a
monetary sanction to show that it acted with ‘substantial justification.’” Doe
v. U.S. Swimming, Inc. (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1424, 1435.
ANALYSIS
Plaintiff’s evidence sufficiently shows that Defendant
failed to serve responses to properly served discovery requests. See Declaration
of Douglas H. Hoang, ¶¶ 3-6. Additionally, Defendant filed no opposition in
order to show substantial justification in avoidance of monetary sanctions.
CONCLUSION
The Court grants the unopposed motion. Defendant shall
serve verified responses, without objections, to Form Interrogatories-General
(Set One), Form Interrogatories-Employment Law, and Request for Production of
Documents (Set One) within 14 days of notice of this ruling. Defendant shall
also pay $1,125.00 in sanctions to Plaintiff by that same date.
