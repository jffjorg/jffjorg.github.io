And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a wage and hour and FEHA case brought by DANIELLE GREENLIN against UTR MANAGEMENT, LLC and ICE KREAM, LLC. The Plaintiff filed a motion to compel the Defendant to serve initial verified responses, without objections, to discovery requests, and to award monetary sanctions against the Defendant in the sum of $1,125.00. The Defendant did not file an opposition to the motion. The Judge found that the Plaintiff's evidence sufficiently shows that the Defendant failed to serve responses to properly served discovery requests, and that the Defendant filed no opposition to show substantial justification in avoidance of monetary sanctions. Therefore, the Judge grants the unopposed motion and orders the Defendant to serve verified responses to the discovery requests within 14 days, and to pay the sanctions to the Plaintiff by the same date.
