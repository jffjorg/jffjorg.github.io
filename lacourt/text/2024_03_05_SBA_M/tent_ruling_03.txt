TENTATIVE RULING

Orock Orock’s, Jeanette Close Liambi’s, and Chantal
Bessong’s Demurrers to Complaint are sustained with 20 days leave to amend. 
 
Background
 
Plaintiff’s Complaint was filed on January 3, 2024. Plaintiff
alleges the following facts. The Complaint is uncertain and nonsensical in many
aspects. However, it appears that the allegations stem from luggage belonging
to Plaintiff that Plaintiff contends went missing when it was in the care and
custody of Orock Orock. As to the other two named Defendants, it appears that
Plaintiff is alleging that these two Defendants made threats against Plaintiff
and his family.  
 
            Meet and Confer
             
            Defendant Orock Orock filed a meet
and confer declaration in sufficient compliance with CCP § 430.41.  (Decl., Orock Orock.)  As to the other two Defendants, Defendant
Orock Orock filed declarations contending that he met and conferred on behalf
of these two other Defendants. All Defendants are currently in pro per. There
is no provision in the statutory scheme which provides that other pro per
parties can meet and confer as representatives of each other. In the future, if
a meet and confer declaration is required, all parties are to meet and confer
individually and another pro per party cannot meet and confer as a
representative of another pro per party.
 
            Demurrers

A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a
complaint as a matter of law and raises only questions of law. (Schmidt v.
Foundation Health (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706.)  In testing the sufficiency of the complaint,
the court must assume the truth of (1) the properly pleaded factual
allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably inferred from those expressly
pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39
Cal.3d 311, 318.)  The Court may not
consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law.  (Moore v. Conliffe (1994) 7 Cal.App.4th
634, 638.) Because a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of a complaint, the
plaintiff must show that the complaint alleges facts sufficient to establish
every element of each cause of action.  (Rakestraw
v. California Physicians Service (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.)  Where the complaint fails to state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action, courts should sustain the demurrer.
 (C.C.P., § 430.10(e); Zelig v. County
of Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.App.4th 1112, 1126.)
Sufficient facts are the essential facts
of the case "with reasonable precision and with particularity sufficiently
specific to acquaint the defendant with the nature, source, and extent of his
cause of action.”  (Gressley v.
Williams (1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643-644.) "Whether the plaintiff will be able to
prove the pleaded facts is irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer."  (Stevens v. Superior Court (1986) 180
Cal.App.3d 605, 609–610.)  Under Code
Civil Procedure § 430.10(f), a demurrer may also be sustained if a complaint is
“uncertain.” Uncertainty exists where a
complaint’s factual allegations are so confusing they do not sufficiently
apprise a defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet.  (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp.
(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)
Defendants demur to the Complaint pursuant
to CCP § 430.10(e) and (f) for failure to state sufficient facts to constitute
a cause of action and uncertainty. Defendants’ demurrers are sustained with 20
days leave to amend. The Complaint is uncertain. 
In the caption section of the
Complaint, which presumably attempts to set forth the names of the causes of
action, Plaintiff listed 15 matters. None of these are recognized causes of
action. The only phrases that come close are “Marriage Fraud” and “Conspiracy.”
However, Conspiracy is not an independent cause of action. “Conspiracy is not
an independent tort; it cannot create a duty or abrogate an immunity. It allows
tort recovery only against a party who already owes the duty and is not immune
from liability based upon applicable substantive tort law principles.” Pavicich
v. Santucci (2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 382, 395–96.
In addition, the Court is not
aware of a separate cause of action called “Marriage Fraud.” However, of
course, “Fraud” is a recognized cause of action. “A complaint for fraud must
allege the following elements: (1) a knowingly false representation by the
defendant; (2) an intent to deceive or induce reliance; (3) justifiable
reliance by the plaintiff; and (4) resulting damages.”  Service by Medallion, Inc. v. Clorox Co.
(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1807, 1816. “[T]he elements of an action for fraud and
deceit based on a concealment are: (1) the defendant must have concealed or
suppressed a material fact, (2) the defendant must have been under a duty to
disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3) the defendant must have intentionally
concealed or suppressed the fact with the intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4)
the plaintiff must have been unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he
did if he has known of the concealed or suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of
the concealment or suppression of the fact, the plaintiff must have sustained
damage.” Boschma v. Home Loan Center, Inc. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 230,
248.
            “Every
element of the cause of action for fraud must be alleged in the proper manner
and the facts constituting the fraud must be alleged with sufficient
specificity to allow defendant to understand fully the nature of the charge
made.”  Tarmann v. State Farm Mut.
Auto. Ins. Co. (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153, 157.  Plaintiffs must state facts which “show how,
when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were
tendered.”  Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645.
            Plaintiff
has failed to allege specific facts to meet the elements of fraud including
false representation, intent to deceive, justifiable reliance, and resulting
damages. Plaintiff has failed to allege specific facts as to how, when, where,
to whom, and by what means the representations were made. 
It does appear that perhaps
Plaintiff may be able to allege a recognizable cause of action for Conversion
as against Orock Orock based on the theory that he potentially converted
Plaintiff’s luggage. As to the other two Defendants, it is unclear what recognizable
causes of action can be alleged based on the alleged verbal and written threats
made by them. However, leave to amend is allotted to Plaintiff to attempt to
allege a viable cause of action.
            Therefore, the Demurrers to the Complaint are sustained
with 20 days leave to amend. 
 
Defendant Orock Orock is ordered to give
notice of this ruling.
