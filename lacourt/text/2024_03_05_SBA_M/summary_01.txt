Summary in English text:

The Honorable Gary Y. Tanaka, Judge of the Los Angeles Superior Court, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Steven Oppenheimer, et al. v. Public Storage, Inc., et al. (Case No. 19STCV24447). The case involves a petition to approve a compromise of the pending action of three minors, Aiden, Ashton, and Avery Oppenheimer, who were injured in an accident caused by the negligence of Defendant Maria Acosta, an employee of Public Storage, Inc.

The court has reviewed the petitions and has determined that they are reasonable and in the best interests of the minors. The court has also reviewed the proposed settlement amounts, costs, expenses, and attorneys' fees and has determined that they appear reasonable.

The court has denied Defendant Centinela Storage Associates' (CSA) opposition to the petitions, which argued that it had standing to intervene in the case and provide its own opinions on what is in the best interests of the minors. The court has held that CSA has no right to object to the petitions and that it is the guardian's responsibility to determine what is in the best interests of the minors.

The court has granted the petitions to approve the compromise of the pending action of the minors and has ordered that the settlement funds be distributed accordingly.
