TENTATIVE RULING
 
            Manuel Guzman’s Motion to Quash Service of
Summons is granted.          
 
            Background
 
            Plaintiff
filed the Complaint on September 19, 2023. Plaintiff alleges the following
facts. Plaintiff Nira Schwartz is a resident of a mobile home park owned by
Skyline Park Land, LLC and Saunders Property LLC. The manager of the mobile
home park, Manuel Guzman, struck Plaintiff without any warning. Plaintiff
alleges the following causes of action: 1. Negligence; 2. Assault and Battery;
3. Premises Liability; 4. Elder Abuse (Welfare and Institutions Code § 15600,
et seq.).
 
            Motion
to Quash 
 
            Code
Civ. Proc., § 415.10 states: 
            “A
summons may be served by personal delivery of a copy of the summons and of the
complaint to the person to be served. Service of a summons in this manner is
deemed complete at the time of such delivery. The date upon which personal
delivery is made shall be entered on or affixed to the face of the copy of the
summons at the time of its delivery. However, service of a summons without such
date shall be valid and effective.”
 
            Code
Civ. Proc., § 416.10 states:
            “A
summons may be served on a corporation by delivering a copy of the summons and
the complaint by any of the following methods:
(a) To the person designated as agent for service of
process as provided by any provision in Section 202, 1502, 2105, or 2107 of the
Corporations Code (or Sections 3301 to 3303, inclusive, or Sections 6500 to
6504, inclusive, of the Corporations Code, as in effect on December 31, 1976,
with respect to corporations to which they remain applicable).
(b) To the president, chief executive officer, or
other head of the corporation, a vice president, a secretary or assistant
secretary, a treasurer or assistant treasurer, a controller or chief financial
officer, a general manager, or a person authorized by the corporation to
receive service of process.
(c) If the corporation is a bank, to a cashier or
assistant cashier or to a person specified in subdivision (a) or (b).
(d) If authorized by any provision in Section 1701,
1702, 2110, or 2111 of the Corporations Code (or Sections 3301 to 3303,
inclusive, or Sections 6500 to 6504, inclusive, of the Corporations Code, as in
effect on December 31, 1976, with respect to corporations to which they remain
applicable), as provided by that provision.”
 
            Code
Civ. Proc., § 415.20 states, in relevant part: 
            “(a)
In lieu of personal delivery of a copy of the summons and complaint to the
person to be served as specified in Section 416.10, 416.20, 416.30, 416.40, or
416.50, a summons may be served by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint
during usual office hours in his or her office or, if no physical address is
known, at his or her usual mailing address, other than a United States Postal
Service post office box, with the person who is apparently in charge thereof,
and by thereafter mailing a copy of the summons and complaint by first-class
mail, postage prepaid to the person to be served at the place where a copy of
the summons and complaint were left. When service is effected by leaving a copy
of the summons and complaint at a mailing address, it shall be left with a
person at least 18 years of age, who shall be informed of the contents thereof.
Service of a summons in this manner is deemed complete on the 10th day after
the mailing.”
 
            Code
Civ. Proc., § 418.10 states, in relevant part: “(a) A defendant, on or before
the last day of his or her time to plead or within any further time that the
court may for good cause allow, may serve and file a notice of motion for one
or more of the following purposes: (1) To quash service of summons on the
ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her.”
 
            Substantial compliance requires a showing
of the following: there must be some degree of compliance, that the
circumstances show that it was highly probable that attempted service imparted
the same notice as full compliance, and that the attempted service provided
sufficient notice to Cross-Defendant to put on a defense. Carol Gilbert,
Inc. v. Haller (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 852, 865-66.
 
            Pursuant
to CCP § 418.10(a)(1), Defendant moves to quash service of the summons on the
grounds that he was not properly served with the summons and complaint under CCP
§ 415.20. Defendant contends that he is not a co-occupant of the address upon
which substitute service was purportedly executed: 25929 Hillworth Avenue,
Lomita, CA. Plaintiff filed a notice of non-opposition to the motion. 
 
            Therefore,
Defendant’s motion to quash service of summons is granted. 
 
            Defendant
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
