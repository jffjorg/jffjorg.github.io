And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant Skyline Park Land, LLC's motion to quash service of summons. The motion was filed on March 5, 2024, and Defendant claims that he was not properly served with the summons and complaint. The judge based its decision on California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) § 415.20, which allows for substitute service of process. However, the judge found that Defendant did not demonstrate sufficient compliance with the requirements for substitute service, and therefore granted the motion. The judge ordered Defendant to give notice of this ruling.
