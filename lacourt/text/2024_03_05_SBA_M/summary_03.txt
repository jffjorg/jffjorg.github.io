And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Sandrack Ngue Ngue v. Orock Orock, et al. The complaint filed by Plaintiff Sandrack Ngue Ngue is uncertain and nonsensical in many aspects. The complaint alleges that the defendant Orock Orock converted Plaintiff's luggage and that the other two defendants made threats against Plaintiff and his family. The judge has sustained the demurrers filed by the defendants with 20 days leave to amend.

The judge has criticized the complaint for failing to allege specific facts to meet the elements of fraud and for failing to specify how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were made. However, the judge has left open the possibility that Plaintiff may be able to allege a recognizable cause of action for Conversion as against Orock Orock.

The judge has also ordered Defendant Orock Orock to give notice of this ruling.
