Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.)¿The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no undue prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice.  (See Ramirez v.

(MC-052, ¶ 2; see also 05/08/2024 Notice of Death of Plaintiff David Martinez.)As to Plaintiff Juana del Carmen Martinez, counsel cites “an irreparable breakdown of [the] attorney-client relationship” that makes it “impossible for attorney to represent this client.” (MC-052, ¶ 2.)There is no opposition to the motion. Here, there is no evidence Plaintiff will be unduly prejudiced by the granting of this motion. Accordingly, Counsel’s Motions to be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiffs are GRANTED.  Moving counsel is ordered to give notice.IT IS SO ORDERED.Dated:   August 15, 2024 ___________________________________ Randolph M.
