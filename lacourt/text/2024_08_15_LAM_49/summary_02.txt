And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion of Attorney Julio Soto-Kim to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiffs David Martinez and Juana del Carmen Martinez. No opposition was filed to the motion. The motion was filed on July 17, 2024, and the court has granted it due to the lack of opposition and the fact that there is no evidence that the Plaintiffs will be unduly prejudiced by the granting of this motion. The court noted that the attorney-client relationship has broken down and it is impossible for the attorney to continue to represent the clients. The Plaintiffs' counsel is ordered to give notice of the granting of the motion.
