And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel production of documents related to the financial condition of Whitestone Builders, Inc. and Pier Pjerin Prenga. The motion was filed by Valerie Taylor and Derek Taylor, who are seeking to use the documents for the purpose of punitive damages. The judge has granted the motion in part, ordering Whitestone and Prenga to produce all documents except for a complete notebook that contains handwritten notes on labor costs. The judge has determined that the documents are relevant to the issue of financial condition and are necessary for trial. However, the judge has also noted that the complete notebook need not be produced, as Whitestone has already produced color copies of the relevant pages. The judge has also rejected the Taylors' attempt to resurrect their lost disgorgement claim, which was previously denied by the court.
