And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Latoya S. Redd v. Tyson & Mendes LLP (T&M). The case involves a dispute over payment of an attorneys' fee lien in the amount of $35,489.51. The plaintiff, Redd, claims that T&M failed to pay her the lien with settlement funds from a previous case. The judge previously denied T&M's anti-SLAPP motion, but T&M filed a notice of appeal on October 22, 2024. Under California Code of Civil Procedure § 916(a), the perfecting of an appeal stays proceedings in the trial court. Therefore, the judge has stayed the proceedings in this case, placing the instant motion off calendar.
