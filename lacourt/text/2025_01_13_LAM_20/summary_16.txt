And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Martha Conteras' motion to consolidate two separate court cases. The first case, case no. 23LBUD03038, is an unlawful detainer matter in which Osbaldo Contreras seeks possession of a property from Martha. The second case, case no. 23STCV23415, is a quiet title action in which Martha seeks to establish her ownership of the same property. The judge decides to consolidate the two cases because they both involve the same property and the same parties, and title issues need to be resolved. The judge cites Code of Civil Procedure section 1048(a) and a previous court case, Martin-Bragg v. Moore, to support the decision. The judge orders that the moving party (Martha) give notice of the consolidation.
