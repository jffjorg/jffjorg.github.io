Plaintiff Martha Conteras seeks to consolidate the instant action with an unlawful detainer matter, case no. 23LBUD03038.In case no. 23STCV23415, Plaintiff Martha Conteras seeks to quiet title as to 2414 Hayes Avenue, Long Beach, CA 90810.  Osbaldo Contreras is the Defendant therein.Case no. 23LBUD03038 is an unlawful detainer matter in which Osbaldo seeks possession against Martha with respect to the aforementioned property.  Martha disputes ownership in that matter.These two cases have been related.Martha now seeks to consolidate these two matters.Code Civ. Proc. § 1048(a) provides, “[w]hen actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the actions;¿it may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.”  The Court will consolidate these matters because title issues exist as to the same property in both disputes and these issues should not be subject to the summary procedures of a UD matter.  (See Martin-Bragg v. Moore (2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 367, 385.)  Additionally, both cases involve the same parties.The Motion to Consolidate is granted.  Moving party to give notice.
