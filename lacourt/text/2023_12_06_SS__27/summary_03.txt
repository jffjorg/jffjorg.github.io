And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for sanctions against the plaintiff for spoliation of evidence. The defendant had sought to impose terminating, evidentiary, and issue sanctions against the plaintiff after the plaintiff allegedly lost a metal piece that was evidence in the case. The judge found that while the plaintiff's loss of the metal piece was not intentional, it was still a serious issue that needed to be addressed. The judge noted that the defendant had not shown that the plaintiff's actions were willful or that the defendant was prejudiced by the loss of the metal piece. The judge also noted that the issue of what remedy is appropriate in a case of possible intentional spoliation is best resolved by the trial court. The judge denied the motion without prejudice, allowing the defendant to raise the issue again at trial.
