And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Lee S. Arian on a motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Nineli Sarkissian, the attorney of record for plaintiff Cynthia Cervera. The motion is granted due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, which has made it impossible for Counsel to effectively represent the client. The Court has determined that Counsel has satisfied the requirements of California Rule of Court Rule 3.1362 by providing a Declaration, Notice, and Proposed Order. Additionally, the Court has found that the plaintiff will not be prejudiced by Counsel's withdrawal, as there is sufficient time to find new representation before trial. The trial is scheduled for July 10, 2024, and the next motion scheduled for hearing is a Final Status Conference on June 26, 2024.
