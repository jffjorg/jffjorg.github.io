And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is in response to a motion to quash service of summons by publication filed by the defendants. The plaintiff, Merced Maldonado, filed the action against the defendants, Barrett Wissman, Nina Kokob (also known as Nina Wissman/Kotova), and DOES 1-20, for injuries arising from an assault and battery incident that occurred at 121 South Rossmore Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90028. The court granted the plaintiff's application for publication, ordering that the summons be published in the Los Angeles Times. The defendants argue that the publication did not give actual notice and that the court lacks jurisdiction to dictate service in any manner that violates treaties between the United States and other countries. The court finds that the Los Angeles Times is a newspaper published in California that is most likely to provide actual notice to someone in Rome, Italy, and upholds the service by publication. The motion to quash is denied.
