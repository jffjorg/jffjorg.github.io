      CASE NO.: 23STCV00588
 
[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL 
 
Dept.
  27
1:30
  p.m.
December
  6, 2023



 
 
Plaintiff’s attorney of record, Nineli
Sarkissian (“Counsel”), seeks to be relieved as counsel.  That requires that she provide a basis for her
withdrawal and satisfy California Rule of Court Rule 3.1362.  Further, such relief cannot cause her client
prejudice. (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406  absent a showing
prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be granted.)  These requirements are satisfied here.
Counsel has stated that she seeks to be
relieved because there has been a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship
precluding Counsel's ability to effectively represent the client in this
matter.  Counsel satisfied Rule 3.1362
because she provided a Declaration, a Notice, and a Proposed Order.  And, Plaintiff has a substantial amount of
time to find new representation before trial and would not be prejudiced. Trial
in this matter is set for July 10, 2024, and the next motion scheduled for
hearing is a Final Status Conference on June 26, 2024.  
Thus, the Court GRANTS Counsel’s Motion
to Be Relieved as Counsel. 
 
Dated: December 6, 2023
