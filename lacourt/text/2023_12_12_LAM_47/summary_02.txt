And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for sanctions against the defendant, Jerry Mao, for his unfounded motion to disqualify counsel. The plaintiff brought the motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5, alleging that the defendant's motion was unfounded and an abuse of the court's process. However, the judge found that the plaintiff failed to comply with the safe harbor provision of section 128.5, which requires a separate notice of motion to be served on the opposing party. The plaintiff's motion did not contain this information, and therefore, the judge denied the motion for sanctions.
