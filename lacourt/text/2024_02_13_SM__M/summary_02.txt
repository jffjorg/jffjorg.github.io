And here is a summary of the ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on the demurrer motions filed by Defendant Robert Rosenbaum. The judge has overruled the demurrer motions as to the causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, intentional interference with a contract, and financial elder abuse. The judge has also denied the motion to strike the claims for punitive damages, treble damages, emotional distress, and prejudgment interest.

The judge found that the complaint alleges sufficient facts to support the causes of action, including breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, and financial elder abuse. The judge also found that the complaint alleges sufficient facts to support the claims for punitive damages, treble damages, emotional distress, and prejudgment interest.

The judge rejected Defendant's arguments that the complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to support the causes of action and that the claims for damages are unsupported. The judge found that the complaint alleges sufficient facts to support the causes of action and that the claims for damages are properly pleaded.

The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change after further review and argument.
