Legal
Standard
 
Relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b)
is either discretionary or mandatory. A motion for mandatory relief must be
made no more than six months after entry of judgment and be accompanied by an
attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to the attorney’s “mistake, inadvertence,
surprise or neglect.” (CCP § 473(b).) The attorney affidavit of fault must
contain a “straight forward admission of fault.” (State Farm Fire &
Casualty Co. v. Pietak (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 600, 610.) But it need
not contain an explanation of the reasons for the attorney’s mistake,
inadvertence surprise or neglect. (Martin
Potts & Assocs., Inc. v. Corsair, LLC (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 432, 438-441.)  Relief must be granted “unless the court
finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the attorney's
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.” (Ibid.) If mandatory relief is granted, the court must “direct the attorney to pay
reasonable compensatory legal fees and costs” to the opposing counsel or
parties. (CCP § 473(b).)
 
Where a party cannot obtain an attorney affidavit of
fault, the party may seek discretionary relief under section 473(b) due to “mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” (CCP § 473(b).) A motion for
discretionary relief must be made “within a reasonable time but in no instance
exceeding six months after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was
taken.” (Id.) If discretionary relief is granted, the court may in its
discretion order the moving party to pay the costs, including attorney fees,
incurred in obtaining the default. (Rogalski v. Nabers Cadillac (1992)
11 Cal.App.4th 816, 823; Vanderkous v. Conley (2010) 188
Cal.App.4th 111, 118-119.) If the motion for discretionary relief is granted, the
court may order the offending attorney to pay monetary sanctions up to $1,000
to opposing parties, or up to $1,000 to the State Bar Client Security Fund, or
“[g]rant other relief as is appropriate.” (CCP § 473(c)(1)(A), (B), (C).)
 
A motion for relief under section 473(b) “shall be
accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted. . .” (CCP § 473(b).)
However, this requirement is
not jurisdictional; substantial compliance may suffice. (Carmel, Ltd. v. Tavoussi (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 393, 403
[finding substantial compliance where counsel offered proposed answer at
motion hearing rather than serving it with moving papers].) 
 
Analysis
 
Defendant Mikhail Siretskiy moves
to be relieved from terminating sanctions, the resulting default, and requests
to reinstate his answer. 
 
As an initial matter, this motion
is an improper motion for reconsideration of the terminating sanctions motion. (CCP
§1008.) Defendant had the full opportunity to make the arguments presented here
in the underlying terminating sanctions motion. This motion was granted on
August 21, 2023. In order to comply with section 1008’s reconsideration
requirements, Defendant should have made this motion within 10 days of service
of the August 23, 2023, service of that ruling. However, this motion was made
on September 26, 2023, well after that time limit. Defendant also does not
present any new or different facts, circumstances, or law that could not have
been presented at the initial hearing on these issues. Defendant relies
completely on excuses or facts which arose prior to the hearing. Thus, the
motion is denied on this alternative basis.
 
Furthermore, the court would deny
the merits of the motion. Defendant claims that neither he nor his counsel
received sufficient notice of the underlying discovery motion and terminating
sanctions motion. Counsel declares that he did not appear at the August 21,
2023, hearing because he was unaware of the hearing until the court mailed the
final ruling on August 23, 2023. However, the Court finds it unlikely that
counsel did not have notice of the terminating sanctions motion, as counsel
submitted a memorandum and declaration in opposition to Plaintiff’s motion for
terminating sanctions on August 14, 2023, which noted the initial August 18,
2023, hearing date. The Court provided notice of continuance for the August 18,
2023, CMC and sanctions hearing date to August 21, 2023. Counsel makes no mention
of appearing at the initial August 18, 2023, hearing date, which if he had,
would have also provided him with notice of the continuance.  Even assuming counsel did not receive notice,
terminating sanctions were not granted because counsel missed the hearing date.
Sanctions were granted for the factual and legal reasons presented in the
ruling, after consideration of Defendant’s opposition. Defendant is therefore
not entitled to mandatory relief for mistake of counsel. 
 
Defendant is also not entitled to
discretionary relief, despite any issues Defendant now presents regarding his
wife in the months prior to the February 2023 hearing. Defendant still could
have complied with his discovery obligations within the six months prior to
August 21, 2023. Moreover, the record also shows sufficient notice to Defendant
regarding the underlying motions.  Most
importantly, Defendant still does not provide evidence that he is in full
compliance with the court’s orders in this action. Defendant mentions paying sanctions,
but does not address the substantive discovery responses underlying the motions
to compel and for sanctions.
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s motion is
DENIED.
