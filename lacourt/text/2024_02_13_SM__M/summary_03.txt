And here is the English summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel arbitration, finding that the plaintiff has agreed to an arbitration agreement covering her claims. The agreement was signed electronically, and the court has determined that the plaintiff's claims arise out of her use of the Lyft platform, which falls within the scope of the arbitration agreement. The court has ordered the plaintiff's claims to be arbitrated, and the entire action is stayed pending the completion of the arbitration.
