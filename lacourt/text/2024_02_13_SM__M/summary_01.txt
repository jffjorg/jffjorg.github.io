And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Defendant's motion to vacate default and terminating sanctions. The Defendant had previously failed to appear at a hearing and had also failed to comply with discovery obligations. The Defendant claimed that he and his counsel did not receive sufficient notice of the motion, but the Judge found this claim to be unlikely given that counsel had submitted a memorandum and declaration in opposition to the motion on August 14, 2023. The Judge also found that the Defendant had failed to provide evidence of full compliance with the court's orders in this action. As a result, the Judge denied the Defendant's motion.
