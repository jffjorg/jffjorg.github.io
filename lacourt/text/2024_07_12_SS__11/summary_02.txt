Here is a brief summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Petitioner's request for coordination of three separate cases: Metropolis Master Association v. Pariser, Pariser v. Metropolis Master Association, and Greenland LA Metropolis I LLC v. Metropolis I Condominium Owners' Association. The Judge found that the cases involve separate disputes between different entities and that coordination would not promote the ends of justice. The Judge also found that the cases are at different stages of litigation and that coordination would not promote settlement. The Judge granted Judicial Notice of the existence of court records, but not their truth. The Judge's ruling is based on the factors set forth in Code of Civil Procedure Section 404.1 and California Rules of Court, rule 3.400.
