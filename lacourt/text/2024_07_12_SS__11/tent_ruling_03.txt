On February 20, 2024, Judge Richard Fruin found MMA complex.  (See 2/20/24 MMA Minute Order, p. 1.)  The minute order does not list the reasons
for his finding, and, regardless, MMA was never transferred to the
Complex Department, and the Complex Department never designated MMA
complex, which is the standard process in the Los Angeles Superior Court. 
 
Parisher, as a small claims action, is definitely not complex.
 
The record here is insufficient
to find any of the Included Actions complex.

Petitioner states:
 
Met Master is a
master association and Met I is a related subassociation.  They are part of the same master common
interest development, their governing documents are integrated, and that
integration includes the power of Met Master to delegate its assessment
collection authority to Met I.
 
(Petitioner’s Reply, p. 5.)
 
The power to delegate does
not change the fact that Met Master and Met I are distinct legal entities with
distinct governing documents, boards, counsel, elections, assessments, and
abatements.  The entities and the alleged
conduct related to them will need to be evaluated separately.

Petitioner’s focus on the location of the Metropolis complex and offices does
not account for Greenland, defense counsel, and the defense witnesses.
