TENTATIVE RULING
 
RCBO’s motion to transfer venue is denied.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This case (22STCV04969) is part
of the coordinated Southern California Clergy Cases (JCCP 5101).  Plaintiff alleges that a priest sexually
abused him when he was a minor.  He
claims RCBO and other Defendants failed to protect him from the alleged abuse
despite having actual or constructive knowledge of the priest’s pedophilia.
 
Here, RCBO moves to transfer
venue to the Orange County Superior Court for trial.
 
LAW
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 397(c), “[e]ven if
filed in a ‘proper’ county, on appropriate motion, the court has discretionary
power to transfer the case to any other county ‘(w)hen the convenience of
witnesses and the ends of justice would be promoted by the change.’”  (Edmon & Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide:
Civ. Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group June 2024 Update) ¶ 3:553,
emphasis in original.)
 
This provision “gives the court the power to moderate the parties’ choices as to where
the action should be tried.”  (Id. at ¶
3:554.)  “Plaintiff may have the right to
file wherever venue is “proper,” but the court still has discretion to transfer
if trial locally would be seriously inconvenient to the witnesses and defeat
the ends of justice.”  (Ibid.)
 
“It is only the convenience of the nonparty witnesses
that is important.”  (Id. at ¶ 3:555,
emphasis in original.)  “Absent
extraordinary circumstances [citation], the parties’ conveniences are not
considered – even if they are to testify.” 
(Ibid., emphasis in original.)  
 
DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff contends the motion is untimely because RCBO
filed it 15 months after Defendants selected this case for bellwether
treatment.  (See Opposition, p. 9.)
 
The Court disagrees. 
“[A] motion for change of venue based on convenience of witnesses must
be made within a reasonable time after the answer is filed.”  (Edmon & Karnow, supra, at ¶ 3:559.5,
emphasis in original.)  “What constitutes
a ‘reasonable’ time rests largely in the trial court’s discretion.”  (Ibid.) 
Per the management process established by the Court and parties,
individual cases are generally stayed until they are chosen as bellwether cases
and given trial dates.  The Court gave
Plaintiff’s case a trial date at a status conference on April 18, 2024.  (See 4/18/24 Minute Order, p. 8.)  At that same status conference, the Court
also set the hearing date for this motion. 
(See id. at p. 9.)  These
circumstances render the motion timely.  
 
Turning to the merits, the following facts support
transferring the case to Orange County:
 
* Plaintiff’s alleged abuse occurred exclusively in Orange
County (see Motion, p. 3);
 
* the priest was an RCBO priest at the time of the alleged
abuse (see ibid.);
 
* RCBO is located in Orange County (see id. at p. 4); and
 
* most of the witnesses reside in Orange County or, at
least, are located outside Los Angeles County. 
(See id. at pp. 3-4; see also Breidenbach Decl., ¶¶ 6-12, Exs. 5-11;
Reply, pp. 3-5.)
 
On the other hand, two facts weigh against a
transfer.  One, the Roman Catholic
Archdiocese of Los Angeles remains a Defendant, and Plaintiff intends to rely
on the priest’s purported sexual abuse of children while working there to show
notice as to RCBO.  Two, this is a
bellwether case set for trial in early October 2024.  This Court has said on several occasions that
it intends to be the trial judge for some of the bellwether cases, especially
to help keep the coordinated litigation moving, to gain insight into the
actions (the issues that arise during trial, jury reactions, etc.), and to get
a sense of the range of case values to aid settlement.
 
To repeat, the decision to transfer or not is
discretionary.  (See Edmon & Karnow,
supra, at ¶ 3:553.)  On balance, the
Court believes the ends of justice are best served by denying the motion.  Given that Plaintiff’s case includes Orange
County Defendants and the primary non-perpetrator Los Angeles County Defendant
and has a fast-approaching trial date, it is a good case for this Court to try
itself.  Keeping Plaintiff’s case here
will benefit the bellwether process.

TENTATIVE RULING
 
RCBO’s motion to transfer venue is granted.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This case (22STCV14258) is part
of the coordinated Southern California Clergy Cases (JCCP 5101).  Plaintiff alleges that a priest sexually
abused him when he was a minor.  He
claims RCBO failed to protect him from the alleged abuse despite having actual
or constructive knowledge of the priest’s pedophilia.
 
Here, RCBO moves to transfer
venue to the Orange County Superior Court for trial.
 
LAW
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 395(a), “the
superior court in the county where the defendants or some of them reside at the
commencement of the action is the proper court for the trial of the
action.”  (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 395,
subd. (a).)
 
Under section 397(a), “[t]he court may . . . change the
place of trial . . . [w]hen the court designated in the complaint is not the
proper court.”  (Id. at § 397, subd.
(a).) 
 
Under section 397(c), “[e]ven if filed in a ‘proper’
county, on appropriate motion, the court has discretionary power to
transfer the case to any other county ‘[w]hen the convenience of witnesses and
the ends of justice would be promoted by the change.’”  (Edmon & Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide:
Civ. Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group June 2024 Update) ¶ 3:553,
emphasis in original.)
 
This provision “gives the court the power to moderate the parties’ choices as to where
the action should be tried.”  (Id. at ¶
3:554.)  “Plaintiff may have the right to
file wherever venue is ‘proper,’ but the court still has discretion to transfer
if trial locally would be seriously inconvenient to the witnesses and defeat
the ends of justice.”  (Ibid.)
 
“It is only the convenience of the nonparty witnesses
that is important.”  (Id. at ¶ 3:555,
emphasis in original.)  “Absent
extraordinary circumstances [citation], the parties’ conveniences are not
considered – even if they are to testify.” 
(Ibid., emphasis in original.)  
 
DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff claims the motion is untimely because RCBO filed
it one month before trial.  (See
Opposition, p. 5.)
 
The Court disagrees. 
“[A] motion for change of venue based on convenience of witnesses must
be made within a reasonable time after the answer is filed.”  (Edmon & Karnow, supra, at ¶ 3:559.5,
emphasis in original.)  “What constitutes
a ‘reasonable’ time rests largely in the trial court’s discretion.”  (Ibid.) 
Per the management process established by the Court and parties,
individual cases are generally stayed until they are chosen as bellwether cases
and given trial dates.  The Court gave
Plaintiff’s case a trial date at a status conference on April 18, 2024.  (See 4/18/24 Minute Order, p. 8.)  At that same status conference, the Court
also set the hearing date for this motion. 
(See id. at p. 9.)  These
circumstances render the motion timely.  
 
RCBO contends Plaintiff’s case must be transferred to
Orange County because the remaining Defendants reside in Orange County.  In support, RCBO cites Code of Civil
Procedure sections 395 and 397(a).  (See
Motion, p. 6; see also Reply, pp. 2-3.)
 
The Court disagrees for two reasons.  One, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los
Angeles was a Defenant when Plaintiff’s case commenced.  (See Motion, p. 3.)  Two, this is a coordinated matter, so
Plaintiff’s case is required to be in Los Angeles County.  His case must be here unless and until the
Court exercises discretion to transfer it to another county.   
 
Turning to the merits, the following facts support
transferring the case to Orange County:
 
* Plaintiff’s alleged abuse occurred exclusively in Orange
County (see Motion, p. 4);
 
* the priest was an RCBO priest at the time of the alleged
abuse (see ibid.);
 
* RCBO is located in Orange County (see id. at p. 5);
 
* the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles has been
dismissed (see id. at pp. 3, 4, 6); and 
 
* most of the witnesses reside in Orange County or, at
least, are located outside Los Angeles County. 
(See id. at pp. 4-5; see also Breidenbach Decl., ¶¶ 4-8, Exs. 3-16;
Reply, pp. 3-5.)
 
However, Plaintiff asserts that “several of Defendant’s
proposed witnesses will not help prove or disprove” his causes of action and
that he intends to file a motion in limine to exclude their testimonies.  (Opposition, p. 3.)
 
The assertion is unpersuasive.  The proposed motion in limine is not before
the Court, and the Court declines to prejudge it.  Relevantly, the current record shows that a
majority of the witnesses reside in Orange County.  Trying the case in Orange County will be more
convenient for them.
 
Plaintiff contends this Court should try the case in order
to “help the Court and the parties understand the range of likely outcomes at
trial and to assist in setting settlement values.”  (Id. at p. 4; see also id. at p. 5 [claiming
“[i]t is important that this Court try” Plaintiff’s case to “gain invaluable
insight into the cases, the juries’ reaction and response to the cases, and the
evidentiary issues that will arise in these cases”].)
 
To repeat, the decision to transfer or not is
discretionary.  (See Edmon & Karnow,
supra, at ¶ 3:553.)  On balance, the
Court believes the ends of justice are better served by granting the
motion.  This Court has said on multiple
occasions that it intends to be the trial judge for some, not all, of
the bellwether cases.  Judicial resources
are limited.  This Court’s availability
is limited.  Given that Plaintiff’s
action only alleges abuses in Orange County and only includes Orange County
Defendants, it is not one of the best or most representative cases for this
Court to try.  Keeping Plaintiff’s case
here will not benefit the bellwether process.
