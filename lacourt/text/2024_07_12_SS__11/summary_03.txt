And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the case and finds that the MMA is not complex, as there is no evidence of the standard process of designation of the Complex Department in the Los Angeles Superior Court being followed. The judge also notes that the Metropolis complex and offices are not relevant to the case, and that the focus on this location does not account for the defense counsel and defense witnesses. The judge intends to evaluate Met Master and Met I as distinct legal entities, rather than as a single complex entity.
