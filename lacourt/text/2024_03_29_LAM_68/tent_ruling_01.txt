RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
MOVING
ATTORNEY: Robert Kent
CLIENT:
 Defendant, Day-O Graphics, Inc.
 
RELIEF REQUESTED
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel
of Record
 
SUMMARY OF ACTION
On August 11, 2023, Plaintiff Peter Simpson filed a
complaint and first amended complaint for unlawful detainer against Defendant
Charles Borom dba Impact International. On August 31, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
first amended complaint against Day-O Graphics, Inc. dba Bella Are Custom
Framing and Impact International. On March 13, 2024, the court entered
the parties’ stipulation whereby possession was deemed no longer in issue.
 
RULING: Denied.
Counsel for plaintiff moves
to be relieved as counsel of record, due to the inability to maintain contact
with the client. 
 
An attorney may withdraw as counsel of record through
compliance with all procedural requirements under Code Civil Procedure section
284 and California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. California Rules of Court rule
3.1362(a), (b), (e) requires the use of Judicial Form MC-051 (Notice), Judicial
Form MC-052 (Declaration), and Judicial Form MC-053 (Proposed Order). All forms
must be served on the client and all parties. (CRC 3.1362(d).) The motion lacks
a filed and served copy of the proposed order in violation of CRC 3.1362(d).
The motion lacks any amended notice of hearing or proof of service for any and
all of the required documents, as required in the March 8, 2024, order
advancing the hearing. 
 
The court also finds the Declaration incomplete. Section 3.b
of the Service portion of the declaration remains unchecked. The court declines
to find unspecified communication with the client via counsel that referred the
client, attorney Steven Wolfson, including mail service on Wolfson constitutes
a sufficient substitution. Counsel needs to provide an explanation for
confirmation and reliance on the last known address in section 3.b.
 
The motion is denied without prejudice.
