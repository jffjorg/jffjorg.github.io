And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion of counsel, Robert Kent, to be relieved as counsel of record for the plaintiff, Peter Simpson. The motion was denied due to the lack of compliance with procedural requirements. Specifically, the motion lacked a filed and served copy of the proposed order, as required by California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d). Additionally, the declaration filed with the motion was incomplete, failing to provide an explanation for confirmation and reliance on the last known address of the client. The judge has ordered the counsel to provide notice and set a case management conference for May 22, 2024.
