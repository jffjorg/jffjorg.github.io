Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

In a tentative ruling, the judge has denied the demurrer (a request to dismiss a complaint) filed by defendants Alex Dela Cuadra and Sona Isayan against plaintiff Eskarleta Torosyan. The plaintiff alleges that she was injured when she slipped on water and/or a slippery substance on the floor of a commercial premises owned, leased, managed and/or maintained by the defendants. The defendants argued that the complaint fails to adequately plead the elements of negligence and premises liability. However, the judge found that the complaint sufficiently alleges that the defendants had a duty to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition, breached that duty by allowing a dangerous condition to exist, and that the plaintiff was injured as a direct result. The judge also rejected the defendants' argument that the complaint fails to specify the location of the accident and the role of the defendants in the incident, finding that such specificity is not required. Finally, the judge determined that the complaint's allegations of negligence and premises liability are not duplicative, and therefore sustained the complaint.
