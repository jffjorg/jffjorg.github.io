And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel further responses to document demands propounded to defendant Armine Petrosian. The motion is deemed moot because defendant Petrosian has served further responses to the requests for production of documents. The Court awards monetary sanctions to plaintiffs Mildred DeCastro, Estrella Choy, Avigdor Kessler, Izuchukwa Okpara, Else Grospe, and Christian Escobar in the amount of $1,600.00, plus a $60 filing fee, payable within 30 days. The Court finds that the defendant's responses to the document demands were evasive and inadequate, necessitating the filing of the motion to compel. The Court also finds that the defendant failed to demonstrate substantial justification for the delay in serving the further responses and failed to provide adequate explanation for the extensions of time requested.
