And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's renewed motion to compel the deposition of the Person Most Qualified (PMQ) of General Motors, LLC. The plaintiff, Keith Fearnside, alleges that the defendant General Motors, LLC breached its express and implied warranties by delivering a new 2021 Chevrolet Suburban with nonconformities to warranty. The plaintiff has presented the vehicle for repair on several occasions, but the defects remain unrepaired. The defendant failed to respond to the plaintiff's meet and confer efforts to schedule a deposition date, which led to the filing of the motion.

The court orders the defendant to designate and produce witnesses to appear for deposition and to give testimony as to the matters requested in the plaintiff's notice of deposition. The deponent is also ordered to produce responsive documents before or on the date of the PMQ deposition.

The court awards sanctions of $2,625.00 to the plaintiff, which is the reasonable amount of attorney's fees incurred for the work performed in connection with the pending motion. The court finds that the defendant's conduct was unreasonable and unjustifiable, and therefore shifts the expense of having had to make this motion to the defendant.
