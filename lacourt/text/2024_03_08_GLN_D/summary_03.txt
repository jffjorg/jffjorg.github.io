Summary in English text:

The Judge has denied the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The defendant argued that the causes of action alleged in the complaint are defective and that the alleged contract is a contract for sale of real property and is therefore invalid. The Judge found that the defendant's arguments were based on a misinterpretation of the contract and that the statutory scheme relied upon by the defendant does not apply to this case. The Judge also noted that the agreement is not an agreement to purchase particular property, but an agreement between the three brothers to invest in property, hold it, and pay the mortgage in accordance with their respective interests in the property. The Judge concluded that the motion was denied and that the case will proceed to trial.
