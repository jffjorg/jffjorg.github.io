And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's motion for an order evidencing assignment of judgment by operation of law in favor of American Express National Bank. The Plaintiff seeks to assign the judgment it obtained against defendant Brandon Jackson to American Express National Bank, citing a merger between the two entities. However, the Judge finds that the Plaintiff has failed to properly file an acknowledgment of assignment of judgment as required by California Code of Civil Procedure section 673. The Judge also denies the Plaintiff's alternative request to amend its pleading to reflect its current name, citing that the judgment has already been entered and any time for appeal has long run. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff's declaration submitted in support of its motion does not include the required information and is not an appropriate acknowledgment of assignment. The motion is denied without prejudice.
