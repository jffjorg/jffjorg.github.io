And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case 23LBCV01452, filed by Juan Carlos Osorio against Platinum Construction. The petition alleges that Platinum Construction recorded a mechanics lien on Osorio's property on December 28, 2022, and has taken no action to enforce it. Osorio seeks a court order to remove the lien.

However, the Judge has denied the petition due to Osorio's failure to properly serve the documents on Platinum Construction. Specifically, Osorio failed to use the required Judicial Council form for proof of service, and the Court cannot ascertain whether all the documents were served on Platinum Construction.

The Judge has set an Order to Show Cause (OSC) for February 6, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department S27, to allow Osorio to provide proof of service and reschedule the hearing. If Osorio files proof of service and reschedules the hearing prior to the OSC, the OSC may be taken off calendar.

The parties must email the Court to indicate their intention to submit on the tentative ruling, and must include the case number and party submitting on the tentative. If a party does not submit on the tentative, they should make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing.
