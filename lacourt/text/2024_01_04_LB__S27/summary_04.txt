And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion for attorneys' fees in the amount of $11,077.50. The defendants prevailed on their anti-SLAPP motion, and are entitled to recover their fees as a matter of course. The judge used the lodestar method to award a reasonable fee, and found that all time billed by the defendant's attorney was objectively reasonable, as well as the billing rate. The motion was supported by the declaration of the defendant's attorney, which detailed the time spent on the motion and the fee motion. The judge noted that the plaintiff failed to oppose the motion, and therefore failed to meet their burden to show a probability of success on the merits. The defendants are ordered to give notice, and the parties are instructed to submit their objections to the tentative ruling by email or appear remotely at the hearing.
