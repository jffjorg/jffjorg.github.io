And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to be relieved as counsel without prejudice due to the lack of proof of personal service of the moving papers on the plaintiff. The proof of service submitted by counsel is unclear and does not indicate whether the papers were served by regular mail, email, or both. The plaintiff's address has not been confirmed, and therefore, the judge cannot determine if the papers were properly served. The judge orders counsel for the plaintiff to give notice of the decision. The parties are instructed to submit on the tentative ruling by emailing the court and to identify the party submitting on the tentative. If a party does not submit on the tentative, they should make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing.
