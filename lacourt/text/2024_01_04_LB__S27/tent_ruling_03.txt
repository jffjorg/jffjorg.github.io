 Case Number:  22LBCV00758    Hearing Date:   January 4, 2024    Dept:  S27 Plaintiff’s attorney, Arash
Nematollahi of Adamson Ahdoot filed this motion to be relieved as counsel on
11/29/23, setting it for hearing on 1/04/24. 
Counsel’s declaration in support of the motion indicates the motion was
personally served on Plaintiff and proof of service will be filed at least five
days prior to the hearing.  The proof of
service of the moving papers, however, is confusing.  It starts by saying the papers were served by
“placing a true copy…enclosed in a sealed envelope addressed as follows,” then
lists the addresses of the parties purportedly served, then has a box checked
indicating the papers were served by email. 
It is not clear if the papers were served by regular mail, email, or both.  In any event, there is no proof of personal
service of the moving papers on Plaintiff. 
Because Plaintiff’s address was not confirmed, and because there is no
proof of service of the moving papers by personal service, the motion is denied
without prejudice.  
 
Counsel for Plaintiff is ordered to
give notice.
 
Parties who intend to submit
on this tentative must send an email to the court at gdcdepts27@lacourt.org indicating intention to submit on the tentative as
directed by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does
not receive an email indicating the parties are submitting on the tentative and
there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion may be placed off calendar.
 If a party submits on the tentative, the
party’s email must include the case number and must identify the party submitting
on the tentative. If any party does not submit on the tentative, the party should
make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing on this matter.
