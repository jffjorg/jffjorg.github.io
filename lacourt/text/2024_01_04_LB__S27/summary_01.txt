And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the motion for leave to amend the complaint filed by Plaintiff Martin Delgado. The plaintiff seeks to add a cause of action for products liability against Amigo Mobility International, Inc., the manufacturer of the mobility scooter on which he fell while shopping at Super Center Concepts, Inc.'s store. The court finds that the plaintiff does not need to provide evidence to support his claims at the pleading stage, and that the proposed amended complaint can be cured by further amendment. The court also finds that Amigo has not shown prejudice from the delay in filing the motion, as the addition of Amigo as a direct defendant does not expand the scope of liability or discovery in the action. The motion for leave to amend is granted, and the plaintiff is ordered to file a separate copy of the amended complaint within ten days.
