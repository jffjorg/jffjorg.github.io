```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the demurrers filed by the defendants to the complaint filed by Digital Planet Studio, Inc. and Irfan Merchant. The defendants argue that the complaint does not state a valid cause of action, but the judge finds that the complaint alleges sufficient facts to support the claims. However, the judge also notes that the meet and confer efforts by the parties were insufficient and requires the parties to meet and confer in good faith over the phone or in person concerning the remaining issues. The hearing on the demurrers is continued for one month, and the parties are required to file a brief and declaration outlining their meet and confer efforts and any resolution reached.
