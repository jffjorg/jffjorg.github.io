And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies defendant Nicole Musselman-Dayan's motion to strike certain allegations from the plaintiff's complaint. The dispute arises from a claim for dissolution of a limited liability company called Pocketbook, which is owned by plaintiff Brittany Dolin and defendant Musselman-Dayan, each holding a 50% interest. Musselman-Dayan seeks to strike allegations of fraud and mismanagement, arguing that they are irrelevant to the claim for dissolution. The judge disagrees, finding that the allegations are relevant to establishing the fifth ground for dissolution, which is the management of the limited liability company has been guilty of, or has knowingly countenanced, persistent and pervasive fraud, mismanagement, or abuse of authority. The judge also notes that defendant failed to meet and confer with plaintiff before filing the motion, but declines to deny the motion based on this failure.
