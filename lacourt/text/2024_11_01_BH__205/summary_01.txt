And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the request for default judgment against Mikhail Siretskiy, the defendant, due to excessive damages sought. The total damages sought in the default judgment are $609,725.86, which exceeds the demand in the complaint. The Judge notes that Code of Civil Procedure section 580, subdivision (a) provides that the relief granted to the plaintiff, if there is no answer, cannot exceed that demanded in the complaint. The Judge also points out that the demand sets a ceiling on recovery in all default judgments. Therefore, the relief requested in the default judgment is excessive and void for being in excess of jurisdiction. An Order to Show Cause re Sanctions for no Default Judgment is set for January 9, 2025 at 9:00 a.m.
