 Case Number:  24SMCP00397    Hearing Date:   November 1, 2024    Dept:  205 Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205   BRITTANY DOLIN,    Plaintiff, v.  NICOLE MUSSELMAN-DAYAN, et al.,   Defendants.    Case No.:  24SMCP00397     Hearing Date:  November 1, 2024     [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:   PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO STRIKE   PORTIONS OF COMPLAINT      BACKGROUND This case arises from a dispute between co-owners of a California limited liability company called Pocketbook.  Pocketbook is engaged in the business of personnel recruitment, placement, and staffing.  Plaintiff Brittany Dolin and Defendant Nicole Musselman-Dayan each respectively hold fifty percent (50%) membership interests in Pocketbook.   Plaintiff seeks a dissolution of the company, alleging fraud and mismanagement by Defendant.  Specifically, Plaintiff claims Defendant falsely claimed that Pocketbook owed back rent on a building owned by Defendant and her husband’s company.  Worse still, Defendant and her husband’s company then sued Pocketbook, and Defendant refused to pay the fees for Pocketbook’s counsel, in an attempt to have Pocketbook default on the suit.  Plaintiff also claims Defendant made unauthorized withdrawals from Pocketbook for alleged salary and expenses to which she was not owed.     This hearing is on Defendant’s motion to strike portions of the Complaint.  Defendant argues that certain scurrilous allegations relating to her alleged fraud and mismanagement of Pocketbook should be stricken as irrelevant to Plaintiff’s sole claim for dissolution.   LEGAL STANDARD The court may, upon motion, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 436, subd. (a).)  The court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court. (Code Civ. Proc. § 436, subd. (b).)  The grounds for moving to strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc. § 437.) Where the defect raised by a¿motion¿to¿strike¿is reasonably capable of cure, “leave¿to¿amend¿is routinely and¿liberally¿granted to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the defect in question.”  (Price v. Dames & Moore¿(2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 355, 360;¿Grieves v. Superior Court¿(1984) 157 Cal. App. 3d 159, 168.)¿ It is generally an abuse of discretion to deny leave to amend, because the¿drastic step of denial of the opportunity to correct the curable defect effectively terminates the pleader’s action.  (CLD Construction Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146-1147.)  The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)  MEET AND CONFER Code Civ. Proc. § 435.5 requires that before the filing of a motion to strike, the moving party “shall meet and confer in person or by telephone” with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to the motion to strike for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the motion to strike.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 435.5(a).)  The parties are to meet and confer at least five days before the date the responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc. § 435.5(a)(2).)  Thereafter, the moving party shall file and serve a declaration detailing their meet and confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc. §435.5(a)(3).)  Defendant submits the Declaration of David Lake, which fails to show the parties met and conferred by telephone or in person.  Notwithstanding, the Court cannot deny a motion to strike based on an insufficient meet and confer.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 435.5 (a)(4).)    DISCUSSION Defendant argues that allegations about her alleged fraud or mismanagement are irrelevant because Plaintiff can establish a claim for dissolution without such allegations.  The Court disagrees.    Corp. Code § 17707.03 states, in relevant part, “Pursuant to an action filed by any manager or by any member or members of a limited liability company, a court of competent jurisdiction may decree the dissolution of a limited liability company whenever any of the events specified in subdivision (b) occurs.”  The events described subdivision (b) include when: “(1) It is not reasonably practicable to carry on the business in conformity with the articles of organization or operating agreement. (2) Dissolution is reasonably necessary for the protection of the rights or interests of the complaining members. (3) The business of the limited liability company has been abandoned. (4) The management of the limited liability company is deadlocked or subject to internal dissension. (5) Those in control of the limited liability company have been guilty of, or have knowingly countenanced, persistent and pervasive fraud, mismanagement, or abuse of authority.” (Corp. Code § 17707.03, subd. (b) (emphasis added).)  Defendant focuses on the first four events, but ignores that Plaintiff is also entitled to dissolution where Defendant is guilty of pervasive fraud, mismanagement or abuse of authority.  As the allegations Defendant seeks to strike go to establishing this fifth event, which would entitle Plaintiff to dissolution, the allegations are not irrelevant and will not be stricken.   CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, the Court DENIES Defendant’s motion to strike.   IT IS SO ORDERED.  DATED:  November 1, 2024   ___________________________ Edward B.
