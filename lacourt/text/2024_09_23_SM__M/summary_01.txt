And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to bifurcate the trial and to leave to amend the pleadings. The motion is denied. The Court will set an OSC Re: Dismissal of UD Action as Possession is no Longer at Issue. The Plaintiff, Moonraker LLC, moves to bifurcate the trial to allow the Court to first determine the equitable issue of rescission and for leave to amend to file a First Amended Complaint (FAC) with a cause of action for ejectment. The Plaintiff seeks to recover damages for the unauthorized occupation of the Subject Property. The Defendant, Mullis, has vacated the Subject Property and removed all personal property from the Guest House.

The Court finds that the Plaintiff no longer has a claim for unlawful detainer but may recover damages. The Plaintiff's request to bifurcate the trial is denied as it would not promote the convenience of witnesses, the ends of justice, or the economy and efficiency of handling the litigation. The Court also finds that the Plaintiff's request to leave to amend the pleadings is denied as it would not be necessary and proper. The Plaintiff's proposed amended pleading would be redundant with the already-pending cross-complaint for rescission, trespass, waste, negligence, and declaratory relief in the related civil action.
