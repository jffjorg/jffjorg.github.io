Bifurcate
 
“The court may, when the
convenience of witnesses, the ends of justice, or the economy and efficiency of
handling the litigation would be promoted thereby [. . .] make an order [. . .]
that the trial of any issue or any part thereof shall precede the trial of any
other issue or any part thereof in the case [. . .]¿ The court, on its own
motion, may make such an order at any time. [. . .]”¿ (CCP § 598.)¿Motions to
bifurcate must be noticed and set for hearing so that an order for bifurcation
is obtained no later than 30 days before trial. (Id.)
 
“The court, in furtherance of
convenience or to avoid prejudice, or when separate trials will be conducive to
expedition and economy, may order a separate trial of any cause of action,
including a cause of action asserted in a cross-complaint, or of any separate
issue or of any number of causes of action or issues, preserving the right of
trial by jury required by the Constitution or a statute of this state or of the
United States.”¿ (CCP § 1048(b).)¿ The issue of bifurcation involves factors of
convenience and judicial economy--factors that are best judged by the trial
court. Trial courts have broad discretion to issue such orders on this subject
that they deem appropriate. (Grappo v. Coventry Financial Corp. (1991)
235 Cal.App.3d 496, 504.) 
 
Leave to Amend
 
If a party
wishes to amend a pleading after an answer has been filed, or after a demurrer
has been filed and after the hearing on the demurrer, or if he or she has
already amended the pleading as a matter of course, the party must obtain permission
from the court before amendment. (CCP §§ 473(a)(1), 576.)  Motions for leave to amend the pleadings are
directed to the sound discretion of the court. “The court may, in furtherance
of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any
pleading . . ..” (CCP § 473(a)(1); see CCP § 576.) Policy favors liberally
granting leave to amend so that all disputed matters between the parties may be
resolved. (See Howard v. County of
San Diego (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1422, 1428.) Absent prejudice to
the adverse party, the court may permit amendments to the complaint “at any
stage of the proceedings, up to and including trial.” (Atkinson v. Elk Corp. (2003) 109
Cal.App.4th 739, 761 [internal quotes omitted].) Where leave is sought to add
entirely new claims, the court may grant leave to amend if the new claims are
based on the same general set of facts, and the amendment will not prejudice
the opposing party. (Austin v.
Massachusetts Bonding & Ins. Co. (1961) 56 Cal.2d 596, 600-602; Glaser v. Meyers (1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 770, 777 [holding
trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting amendment of complaint,
which originally alleged constructive eviction, to allege retaliatory eviction
where the new claim was based on the same general set of facts].)
 
Although
denial is rarely justified, a judge has discretion to deny leave to amend if
the party seeking the amendment has been dilatory, and the delay has prejudiced
the opposing party. (Morgan v. Superior
Court (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527, 530; Hirsa v. Superior Court
(1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 486, 490). An opposing party is prejudiced where the
amendment would necessitate a trial delay along with a loss of critical
evidence, added preparation expense, increased burden of discovery, etc. (Magpali
v. Farmers Group, Inc. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471, 486-488 [leave properly
denied where plaintiff sought leave on the eve of trial, nearly two years after
the complaint was originally filed and gave no explanation for the delay which
prejudiced defendant who did not discover or depose many of the witnesses who would
support the new allegations and had not marshaled evidence in opposition of the
new allegations].)
 
Procedurally,
a motion for leave to amend must state with particularity what allegations are
to be amended. Namely, it must state what allegations in the previous pleading
are proposed to be deleted and/or added, if any, and where, by page, paragraph,
and line number. (CRC, Rule 3.1324(a)(2)-(3).) The motion must be accompanied
by a declaration specifying: (1) the effect of the amendment; (2) why the
amendment is necessary and proper; (3) when the facts giving rise to the
amended allegations were discovered; and (4) the reasons why the request for
amendment was not made earlier. (CRC, Rule 3.1324(b).) The motion must also be
accompanied by the proposed amended pleading, numbered to differentiate it from
the prior pleadings or amendments. (CRC, Rule 3.1324(a)(1).) It is within the
court’s discretion to require compliance with Rule 3.1324 before granting leave
to amend. (Hataishi v. First American Home Buyers Protection Corp. (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 1454, 1469.)
 
ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiff Moonraker LLC moves to
bifurcate the trial to allow the Court to first determine the equitable issue
of rescission and for leave to amend to file a First Amended Complaint (FAC) with
a cause of action for ejectment.
 
Ejectment is a common law remedy
for property owners seeking to recover possession and damages from
unlawful occupants. (Rickley v. Goodfriend (2013) 212 Cal.App.4th 1136,
1154.) Unlike unlawful detainer and forcible entry or detainer, ejectment
actions are not statutory summary proceedings. (Titus v. Canyon Lake
Property Owners Ass'n (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 906, 914, disapproved on other
grounds by Brown v. USA Taekwondo (2021) 11 Cal.5th 204, 212-213.) Critically,
Plaintiff shows that possession is no longer at issue in this unlawful detainer
action. Plaintiff represents that Mullis vacated the Subject Property since the
prior hearing, and that he removed all of his personal property from the
subject Guest House, including Plaintiff’s furnishings.
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
1179a provides: “In all proceedings brought to recover the possession of
real property pursuant to the provisions of this chapter all courts,
wherein such actions are or may hereafter be pending, shall give such actions
precedence over all other civil actions…” (Emphasis Added.) CCP section 1952.3
states that “if the lessor brings an unlawful detainer proceeding and
possession of the property is no longer in issue because possession of the
property has been delivered to the lessor before trial… the case becomes an
ordinary civil action” and the “the lessor shall first amend the complaint… so
that possession of the property is no longer in issue and to state a claim for
such damages and shall serve a copy of the amended complaint on the defendant
in the same manner as a copy of a summons and original complaint is served.”
(Emphasis added.) An action commenced as a summary unlawful detainer must be converted
to a civil action through amendment when possession is no longer at issue. (Lynch
& Freytag v. Cooper (1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 603, 608-609 [UD converted to
ordinary breach of contract action where fatal defect in three-day notice]; see
Martin-Bragg v. Moore (2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 367, 389-391 [it is an abuse
of discretion to deny request to consolidate UD and quiet title actions,
forcing party to defend complex title issues under summary procedures].) Thus,
Plaintiff no longer has a claim for unlawful detainer but may recover damages. 
 
In the related civil action,
24SMCV02307, Plaintiff and its principal, Ebudo, filed a cross-complaint for
rescission, trespass, waste, negligence, and declaratory relief, seeking
damages against Defendant. Any amended complaint in this action would be
redundant with Plaintiff’s already-pending cross-complaint covering the same
relief. In light of the fact that Plaintiff has already filed a pleading for
damages, the Court concurs that the parties should simply litigate these issues
in the related civil action. 
 
Accordingly, the motion is DENIED. The
Court will set an OSC Re: Dismissal of UD Action as Possession is no Longer at
Issue.
