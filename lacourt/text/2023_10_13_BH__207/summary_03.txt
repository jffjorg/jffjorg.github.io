Here is the English summary of the tentative ruling:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's application for a writ of attachment against the Defendants, Joshua Bordin-Wosk and B | B Law Group, LLP. The Plaintiff, Aren Roui Israel, is seeking to enforce a breach of written contract claim, alleging that the Defendants failed to pay him a referral fee of 15% of their attorney fee award. The Judge found that the Plaintiff failed to establish a probable validity of prevailing on his claim because he did not provide evidence of a written agreement to divide the fee, as required by the California Rules of Professional Conduct, rule 1.5.1. The Judge also found that the Plaintiff did not provide evidence that the client, Lea Tayahua, consented in writing to the fee split.
