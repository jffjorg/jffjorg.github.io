And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion by Defendants Daryn Wood and Matthew Ferrone to quash a subpoena issued to Verizon Wireless for their phone records. The subpoena was issued as part of the lawsuit filed by Plaintiff Robert H. Feldman against the Defendants, who are the HOA for Plaintiff's property and its board members. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants failed to properly assess whether the property required repairs, failed to complete adequate repairs, and retaliated against the Plaintiff by tampering with his air conditioning and exposing him to toxic chemicals. The Defendants argue that the phone records are only relevant to the HVAC incident that occurred on August 21, 2020, and that the Plaintiff is not entitled to three months of phone records, which would violate their privacy rights. The judge has granted the motion and has temporally narrowed the subpoena to August 16, 2021, to August 25, 2021. The judge has also awarded the Defendants reduced sanctions in the amount of $1,250.
