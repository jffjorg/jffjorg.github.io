And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the Petition of J.G. Wentworth Originations, LLC for approval to transfer $34,000 in exchange for Gilbert Becerrada's right to future payments totaling $127,769.40. The Court has considered the totality of the circumstances and finds that the transfer appears to be in Becerrada's best interests. The transfer agreement and disclosure form comply with the Insurance Code sections on structured settlement transfers. Becerrada has waived his right to independent legal or financial advice, but the Court notes that he did not receive such advice and may benefit from it. The Court grants the Petition, but orders Petitioner to notify all interested parties. If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
