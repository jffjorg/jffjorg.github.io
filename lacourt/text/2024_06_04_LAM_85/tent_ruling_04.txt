The courts look to the substance of an injunction to determine whether it is
prohibitory or mandatory.  Agricultural
Labor Relations Bd. v. Superior Court, (1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 709, 713.  A mandatory injunction — one that mandates a
party to affirmatively act, carries a heavy burden: “[t]he granting of a
mandatory injunction pending trial is not permitted except in extreme cases
where the right thereto is clearly established.”  Teachers Ins. & Annuity Assoc. v.
Furlotti, (1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 187, 1493.

However, a court may issue an injunction to maintain the status quo
without a cause of action in the complaint. 
CCP §526(a)(3).


[3] An
“Historical Monument” is “any site …, building or structure of particular
historic or cultural significance to the City of Los Angeles, including
historic structures or sites in which the broad cultural, economic or social
history of the nation, State or community is reflected or exemplified….”  LAAC §22.171.7.


[4] The Commission performs
functions relating to historic and cultural preservation of sites, buildings,
or structures that embody the heritage, history, and culture of the City.  LAAC §22.171.1.  The Commission is part of the Planning
Department.  


[5]
The “owner” is defined as “the person appearing as the owner of the property on
the last Equalized Assessment roll of the County of Los Angeles and appearing
as the owner of the property on the records of the City Clerk.”   LAAC §22.171.10(d).


            [6] Petitioners
request judicial notice of the following exhibits: (1) Notice of Proposed
Demolition dated July 31, 2023 (Ex. 1); (2) Demolition permit issued by LADBS
on September 7, 2023 (Ex. 10); (3) Grading permit issued by the City on
September 7, 2023, to Owners (Ex. 11); (4) September 11, 2023 letter (and
accompanying internal City emails) from the City's Permit and Engineering
Bureau to Owners (Ex. 12); (5) LAMC section 91.106.4.5.1 (Ex. 32); (6) City
Council motion dated September 8, 2023 in connection with Owners’ property and
permits (Ex. 41); (7) Los Angeles Ordinance No. 185472, amending LAAC section
22.171 et seq., LAAC sections 22.171.8, 22.171.10, and 22.171.12 (Ex. 31); (8) Application
for nomination of Owners’ property to the Commission, prepared by Goers (Ex.
47); (9) CAO report recommending City Council's approval of contracts with
consultants, dated October 15, 2019 (Ex. 46); (10) Greene Archives v.
Marilyn Monroe LLC, (9th Cir. 2012) 692 F.3d 983 (Ex. 53); and (11)
Department of Planning recommendation to Commission in Case No.
CHC-2015-2179-Historic Cultural Monument (5258 N. Hermitage, Dougherty House)
(Ex. 54).
The requests are granted for Exhibits Ex. 10, 11, 31, 32, 41
and 53.  Evid. Code §§ 452(b), (c),
(d).  The requests are denied for
Exhibits 1, 12, 46, 47, and 54.  They are
not official acts of the City.  Evid.
Code §452(c).  The staff memoranda
and recommendations are not subject to judicial notice as they are not
“legislative history” of a resolution or other legislative action.  See Evans v. City of Berkeley,
(2006) 38 Cal.4th 1, 7, n. 2. 
            The City requests judicial  notice of the following exhibits: (1) LAMC sections
91.105.1, 91.106.4.5.1, and 98.0403.2 (Ex. B); (2) a copy of the Planning Department’s
Report and Recommendation to the Commission (Ex. C); (3) e-mails and
accompanying photos produced in response to Petitioners’ California Public
Records Act (“CPRA”) inquiry to LADBS (Ex. D); (4) a record of the City
Council’s September 8, 2023 action regarding initiation of the City
Historic-Cultural Monument designation process for the Property (Ex. E); and
(5) a real estate report from Trulia showing that the last sale of the Property
was on August 18, 2023 for $8.35 million (Ex. G). 
The requests are granted for Exhibits B and E.  Evid. Code §452(b).  The requests are denied for Exhibits C-D and
G because they are not official acts nor legislative history of a final City
Council action.  See Evans
v. City of Berkeley, supra, (2006) 38 Cal.4th 1, 7, n. 2.
The
court has ruled on Petitioners’ written evidentiary objections.  The clerk is directed to scan and
electronically file the court’s rulings. 


[7]
The court could not find this reference on page 21 of Exhibit 56.


[8]
Petitioners argue that the outcome before the City Council is virtually assured,
and that it is futile for them to fight City Hall.  Mot. at 20. 
Whatever the truth of this argument, it has no bearing on any irreparable
harm they will suffer by waiting for the City Council to act or fail to act by
June 16.


[9]
Petitioners also rely on a a bankruptcy case, San Clemente Estates v. City
of San Clemente, (“San Clemente”) (Bankr. S.D. Cal. 1981) 12 B.R.
209, in which the bankruptcy court found that the city council was intimately
aware of a project when it later adopted changes to the zoning ordinances.  Id. at 217.  Mot. at 16-17.  
The wrinkle in San Clemente was that there was
no permit, but there was a final tract map and a CUP showing compliance with Subdivision
Tract Map Act and local ordinances.  Id.
at 217.  Since the developer had paid
more than $600,000 and the planning commission was fully aware of the project
(which had taken seven years), vested rights were established and the city was
estopped from not issuing a permit.  Id.
at 218.  The court does not find this
non-binding authority significantly different than those cases finding vested
rights based on good faith reliance on a permit.  


[10]
The court need not address the City’s issues of ripeness, failure to exhaust
administrative remedies or unlawful piecemealing of a project under CEQA.  See Opp. at 12-13, 19-20.
