And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the petition for injunctive relief. The court has granted judicial notice of certain exhibits, including the demolition permit, grading permit, and Los Angeles Municipal Code section 91.106.4.5.1. The court has denied judicial notice of other exhibits, including the notice of proposed demolition and the September 11, 2023 letter from the City's Permit and Engineering Bureau. The court has also denied the City's request for judicial notice of the real estate report showing the last sale of the Property for $8.35 million. The court has ruled on the petitioners' written evidentiary objections and has directed the clerk to scan and electronically file the court's rulings. The court has also found that the outcome before the City Council is virtually assured, and that it is futile for the petitioners to fight City Hall.
