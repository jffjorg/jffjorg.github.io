 Case Number:  24STCP01469    Hearing Date:   June 4, 2024    Dept:  85 
Brinah Milstein, et al. v. City
of Los Angeles, 24STCP01469 
 

Tentative decision on motion for
preliminary injunction: denied 




 



 
Petitioners/Plaintiffs Brinah Milstein, acting as an
individual and as Trustee of the Glory of the Snow 1031 Trust, a California
Trust, and Roy Bank (sometimes, “Owners”) seek a preliminary injunction enjoining
Respondent/Defendant City of Los Angeles (“City”) from furthering the Historic Cultural
Monument process initiated for their property located at 12305 5th Helena Drive Los Angeles, California (the
“Property”). 
The court has read and considered the moving papers,
opposition, and reply, and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
A. Statement of
the Case
1. Petition
Petitioners filed the Petition/Complaint
on May 6, 2024, alleging eight causes of action for mandamus under CCP sections
1085 and 1094.5, violation of substantive and procedural due process, and declaratory
relief.  The Complaint/Petition alleges
in pertinent part as follows.
Petitioners own the Property.  Pet. ¶18. 
They bought the Property in July 2023
and were issued demolition and grading permits (“Permits”) by the City. Pet.
¶2. The Permits were held for 30 days pursuant to LAMC section 91.106.4.5.1 to
allow “preservation” objections, but none were made.  Pet. ¶2. 

As a result, Petitioners were
entitled to use the validly issued Permits. 
They relied on the Permits by incurring over $30,000 in expenses before
receiving notice of the illegal stay invoked by the City.  Pet. ¶2.  On September 6 and 7, 2023, City staff and
third parties invalidated the issued permits.  Pet. ¶3. 
On September 8, 2023, the City
initiated the “Historic Cultural Monument” process for the Property which was
initiated in violation of the Brown Act and City Council Rule 23, relying on a
patently unconstitutional ordinance (LAMC section 22.171.12) to stay Owners’
vested rights without any evidence to support the Historic Cultural Monument
designation and without any notice or opportunity to be heard by Owners in
violation of their due process rights.  Pet. ¶3. 

The City compounded the illegality
of its motion and resulting stay of the Permits by violating the requirements
of the Los Angeles Administrative Code (“LAAC”).  Pet. ¶4. 
The motion should have directed the Cultural Heritage Commission (“Commission”)
to investigate the Property’s status as required by LAAC section 22.171.10 but
instead directed the Planning Department to prepare an application for nomination
as a Historic Cultural Monument.  Pet.
¶4. 
The Planning Department, City
Councilmember Traci Park, and non-profit Los Angeles Conservancy have attempted
to rig the process to nominate and designate the house on the Property as a Historic
Cultural Monument.  Pet. ¶6. Both Los
Angeles Conservancy and Hollywood Heritage advocated for designation of the
Property before and as part of the nomination process.  Pet. ¶5. 
The Planning Department arranged for a biased third party, Heather Goers
(“Goers”), who is affiliated with the Los Angeles Conservancy and Hollywood
Heritage, to prepare the nomination documents.  Pet. ¶5. 
Petitioners are informed and believe that Goers did not have a contract
with the City and acted without legal authority.  Pet. ¶¶ 5-6.  The City delegated the nomination preparation
to Goers to ensure the desired outcome rather than using unbiased historic
consultants under contract with the City, and this biased process corrupted the
nomination process.  Pet. ¶¶ 7-8.  
Councilmember Park and her staff
demonstrated bias throughout the process which compromised the required fair
and impartial process.  Pet. ¶10.  Councilmember Park held a press conference
advocating for designation of the Property as a Historic Cultural Monument before
bringing her motion to the City Council at which she misrepresented details
about the Property’s home to support her position.  Pet. ¶11. 
Park admitted the vested nature of Owners’ Permits and stated that she
and her staff had been working around the clock to find a way to revoke them.  Pet. ¶¶ 11-12.  Park continued her advocacy in a staged TikTok
video after the motion was adopted by the City Council.  Pet. ¶13. 
The biased nomination process then
was rubber-stamped through hearings before the Commission and the City
Council’s Planning and Land Use Management Committee (“PLUM”), ignoring the
applicable criteria for Historic Cultural Monument designation.  Pet. ¶9. 
Virtually every neighborhood group
in the area opposes designation of the residence as a Historic Cultural Monument.  Pet. ¶16. 
The City has ignored this opposition and announced its intent to
continue its actions on April 2, 2024.  The
City’s failure to respond to Petitioners’ efforts to resolve the dispute necessitated
the filing of this Petition/Complaint to prevent further irreparable harm.  Pet. ¶14.  Petitioners have exhausted all required
efforts to object to the designation and seek a remedy, making further efforts
futile.  Pet. ¶17.
For the first, second, third and fourth causes of action,
Petitioners seek issuance of a writ of mandate and a preliminary injunction
compelling Respondent City to comply with its ministerial duties and halt all
further efforts to deprive Petitioners of their vested rights.  Prayer, ¶1. 
For the fifth, sixth and seventh causes of action, Petitioners seek preliminary
and permanent injunctive relief stopping the City from furthering the Historic Cultural
Monument designation process initiated in violation of law and mandating
restoration of the Permits.  Prayer,
¶2.  For the eighth cause of action, Petitioners
seek a declaration of their rights with respect to the Historic Cultural Monument
designation issue.  Prayer, ¶3.  Petitioners also seek costs of suit and, if
available, attorney’s fees.  Prayer, ¶4.
 
B. Applicable Law
An injunction is a writ or order requiring a person to
refrain from a particular act; it may be granted by the court in which the
action is brought, or by a judge thereof; and when granted by a judge, it may
be enforced as an order of the court. 
CCP §525.  An injunction may be
more completely defined as a writ or order commanding a person either to
perform or to refrain from performing a particular act.  See Comfort v. Comfort, (1941)
17 Cal.2d 736, 741. McDowell v. Watson, (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1155, 1160.[1]  It is an equitable remedy available generally
in the protection or to prevent the invasion of a legal right.  Meridian, Ltd. v. City and County of San
Francisco, et al., (1939) 13 Cal.2d 424.
The purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status
quo pending final resolution upon a trial. 
See Scaringe v. J.C.C. Enterprises, Inc., (1988) 205
Cal.App.3d 1536. Grothe v. Cortlandt Corp., (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1313,
1316; Major v. Miraverde Homeowners Assn., (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 618,
623.  The status quo has been
defined to mean the last actual peaceable, uncontested status which preceded
the pending controversy.  Voorhies v.
Greene (1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 989, 995, quoting United Railroads v.
Superior Court, (1916) 172 Cal. 80, 87. 14859 Moorpark
Homeowner’s Assn. v. VRT Corp., (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1396. 1402.
A preliminary injunction is issued after hearing on a
noticed motion.  The complaint normally
must plead injunctive relief.  CCP
§526(a)(1)-(2).[2]  Preliminary injunctive relief requires the
use of competent evidence to create a sufficient factual showing on the grounds
for relief.  See e.g. Ancora-Citronelle
Corp. v. Green, (1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 146, 150.  Injunctive relief may be granted based on a
verified complaint only if it contains sufficient evidentiary, not ultimate,
facts.  See CCP §527(a).  For this reason, a pleading alone rarely
suffices.  Weil & Brown, California
Procedure Before Trial, 9:579, 9(ll)-21 (The Rutter Group 2007).  The burden of proof is on the plaintiff as
moving party.  O’Connell v. Superior
Court, (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1452, 1481. 
A plaintiff seeking injunctive relief must show the absence
of an adequate damages remedy at law. 
CCP §526(4); Thayer Plymouth Center, Inc. v. Chrysler Motors,
(1967) 255 Cal.App.2d 300, 307; Department of Fish & Game v. Anderson-Cottonwood
Irrigation Dist., (1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 1554, 1565.  The concept of “inadequacy of the legal
remedy” or “inadequacy of damages” dates from the time of the early courts of
chancery, the idea being that an injunction is an unusual or extraordinary
equitable remedy which will not be granted if the remedy at law (usually
damages) will adequately compensate the injured plaintiff.  Department of Fish & Game v.
Anderson-Cottonwood Irrigation Dist., (1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 1554, 1565.
In determining whether to issue a preliminary injunction,
the trial court considers two factors: (1) the reasonable probability that the
plaintiff will prevail on the merits at trial (CCP §526(a)(1)), and (2) a
balancing of the “irreparable harm” that the plaintiff is likely to sustain if
the injunction is denied as compared to the harm that the defendant is likely
to suffer if the court grants a preliminary injunction.  CCP §526(a)(2); 14859 Moorpark Homeowner’s
Assn. v. VRT Corp., (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1396. 1402; Pillsbury, Madison
& Sutro v. Schectman, (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1283; Davenport v.
Blue Cross of California, (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 435, 446; Abrams v. St.
Johns Hospital, (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 628, 636.  Thus, a preliminary injunction may not issue
without some showing of potential entitlement to such relief.  Doe v. Wilson, (1997) 57 Cal.App.4th
296, 304.  The decision to grant a
preliminary injunction generally lies within the sound discretion of the trial
court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.  Thornton v. Carlson, (1992) 4
Cal.App.4th 1249, 1255.
A preliminary injunction ordinarily cannot take effect
unless and until the plaintiff provides an undertaking for damages which the
enjoined defendant may sustain by reason of the injunction if the court finally
decides that the plaintiff was not entitled to the injunction.  See CCP §529(a); City of South San
Francisco v. Cypress Lawn Cemetery Assn., (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 916, 920.
 
C. Governing
Law
The City Council, the Commission, or the Planning Department
Director may initiate consideration of a proposed Historic Monument
designation.  Any initiation by the City
Council or Commission shall be by majority vote.  The City Council or the Commission shall forward
the proposed designation to the Director for a report and recommendation.  LAAC §22.171.10(a).
Any interested individual may apply for a proposed
designation of a site, building, or structure as an Historical Monument.[3]  The applicant shall complete the application
for the proposed designation on a form provided by the Planning Department,
include all information required, pay the required fee, and file the
application with the Planning Department. 
LAAC §22.171.10(b).
Upon receipt of a proposed designation initiated by the City
Council, the Commission[4]
shall, pursuant to LAAC section 22.171.8, inspect and investigate the proposed
designation.  LAAC §22.171.10(c)(2).  As part of this inspection and investigation,
the Commission or staff shall, inter alia,
tour or review photographic/videographic records of the site and solicit
opinions and information from the office of the Council District in which the
site is located and from any City department or bureau whose operations may be
affected by designation of the site. 
LAAC §22.171.8. The Director shall thereafter prepare a report and
recommendation on the proposed designation. 
LAAC §22.171.10(c)(2).  After
receipt of the Director’s report, the Commission shall determine at a public
meeting whether the site, building, or structure conforms with the definition
of a Historic Monument.  LAAC
§22.171.10(c)(2).  The Commission shall
submit a report and recommendation to the City Council.  If the Commission recommends approval, the
City Council may adopt the designation by a majority vote.  LAAC §22.171.10(c)(2).  If the Commission recommends disapproval, the
City Council may adopt the proposed designation by a two-thirds vote.  Id. 
The City Council shall act within the time specified in LAAC section
22.171.10(f).
            Written
notice must be given to the property owner[5]
and owner’s representative for the City Council’s initiation of a proposed
designation and a temporary stay issued pursuant to LAAC section 22.171.22.  LAAC §22.171.10(d)(1).  The property owner and representative shall
be notified of the time, place, and purpose of the public hearing on the
Commission’s action for the proposed designation, given at least ten days before
the hearing (LAAC §22.171.10(d)(4)), and also for the public hearing on the
City Council’s action on the proposed designation, given at least ten days
before the hearing.  LAAC
§22.171.10(d)(4).  The written notice
must be sent via certified mail, return receipt requested.  Ibid. 

             The City Council may approve or
disapprove in whole or in part an application or initiation for a proposed
designation of a Historic Monument.  The
City Council shall act within 90 days of the public hearing held before the
Commission on the proposed designation. The City Council may unilaterally
extend the 90-day time limit to act for a maximum of 15 days for good
cause.  With written consent of the
owner, the time for the City Council to act may be extended by up to an
additional 60 days. If the City Council does not act on the application or
initiation within the specified time limit, the application or initiation to
designate a Historic Monument shall be deemed to have been denied. The City
Council may override a Commission recommendation to deny a City
Council-initiated designation by a minimum of ten votes.  LAAC §22.171.10(f).
Upon the filing of an application for a Historical Monument,
the Director or his or her designee shall determine whether the application is
complete and warrants further investigation by the Commission.  LAAC §22.171.12.  Upon such determination, or upon initiation
by the City Council, the Commission, or Director, no permit for the demolition,
substantial alteration, or removal shall be issued, and the site, building, or
structure, shall not be demolished, substantially altered, or removed pending
final determination by the Commission and City Council whether it shall be
designated as a Historic Monument.  Id.  If, after the expiration of the final period
to act in section 22.171.10(f) the City Council has not acted to designate a Historic
Monument, the demolition, alteration, or removal of the site, building, or
structure may proceed.  Id.
            Once
designated as a Historical Monument, no permit for the demolition, substantial
alteration, or relocation of the Historical Monument shall issue without review
by the Commission.  LAAC §22.171.14.  The Commission must evaluate whether a
substantial alteration “protects and preserves the historic and architectural
qualities and the physical characteristics that make the site, building, or
structure a designated Monument.”  LAAC
§22.171.14(a)(2).
            The
Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety (“LADBS”) shall not issue a
building permit for demolition of a building or structure where the original
building permit was issued more than 45 years prior to the date of application
for demolition pre-inspection, or where information submitted with the
application indicates the building or structure is more than 45 years old,
without having sent written notices of the demolition pre-inspection
application by mail to abutting property owners and the Council District Office
for the site at  least 30 days prior to
issuance of the demolition permit or structure permit.  LAMC §91.106.4.5.1.
 
C. Statement of Facts[6]
1. Petitioners’ Evidence
In mid-2023, Petitioners purchased the Property, which is
adjacent to their existing home, with the intention of combining the properties.  Bank Decl., ¶3.  This required the demolition of some or all
of the aged structures and other dilapidated improvements.  Bank Decl., ¶3. The house on the Property has
had 14 owners since Marilyn Monroe’s death in 1962, with over 30 building
permits issued for various remodels.  Sheridan
Decl., ¶5, Ex. 30.  No physical evidence
remains that Monroe ever lived there; no furniture, paint, carpet, or other
items from her time remain. Bank Decl., ¶ 3. Courts have determined that the
home was not her legal residence. Sheridan Decl., Ex. 53.
Petitioners submitted
an application for a demolition permit for the Property on July 31, 2023, and a
Notice of Demolition placard was conspicuously placed at the Property on the
same day.  Bank Decl., ¶4, Ex. 1.  Petitioners are informed and believe that a
Notice of Proposed Demolition was also mailed by the City to CD-11, the City Council
Office for Councilmember Park and adjoining property owners.  Bank Decl., ¶4, Ex. 2.  Following the posting and mailing of the
Notice of Demolition, Owners never received any notice or objection from any
person or entity during the 30-day period from July 31, 2023 to August 31,
2023.  Bank Decl., ¶4.
Between July 11 and
September 8, 2023, Petitioner Bank caused, or committed to, payments totaling
over $20,000 to consultants, contractors, and other third parties in
anticipation of the City issuing the Permits, including the following: (a) payment
of $3,000 for consulting services between July 11 and August 28, 2023 by Wayne
Moss Constructors, Inc. regarding demolition of the Property, which Bank paid on
September 5, 2023 (Ex. 3); (b) payment of $1,550 to T&T Environmental
(“TTE”) to prepare an asbestos survey and report in connection with the
Property, which TTE furnished on August 16, 2023 (Ex. 4); (c) payment of
$2,708.39 to SoCalGas for invoice dated August 28, 2023 pursuant to an
agreement that SoCalGas would abandon gas lines at the Property (Ex. 5); d) payment
of $3,199.22 on September 20, 2023 to permitting consultant Jason Ungar for
preparing the applications for and processing the Permits  between July 29 and September 7, 2023 (Ex. 6);
(e) payment of $1100 to J&J Environmental to perform asbestos abatement at
the Property completed on September 1, 2023 (Ex. 7); (f) payment of $269.25 to
The Best Demolition & Recycling Co. for costs incurred on September 8, 2023
associated with Los Angeles Air Quality Management District’s notification fees
(Ex 8); and (g) a $11,000 retainer for T Engineering to provide civil engineering
services (Ex.  9). Bank Decl., ¶6.
On September 7, 2023,
the City issued the Permits.  Bank Decl.,
¶7, Exs. 10-11.  The
Permits were put on a 30-day hold, as required by LAMC section 91.106.4.5.1 for
properties over 45 years old, allowing time for any preservation objections.
Sheridan Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. 32. No objections were raised during this period,
which expired on August 31, 2023.  Bank
Decl., ¶ 5.
After the 30-day hold expired, a third-party letter from a
conservancy group was submitted to Councilmember Park's office on September 6,
2023, prompting rapid action to invalidate the permits and prepare a historic
designation nomination.  Sheridan Decl.,
¶ 4, Ex. R.  
Bank did not receive
any advance notice of the City Council’s September 8, 2023 motion to initiate
consideration of the Property as a proposed Historical Cultural Monument.  Bank Decl., ¶9.  He only received the formal notice from the
City in the mail between ten days to two weeks or more after September 8, 2023.
 Banks Decl., ¶10.  Bank received the notice even though no
person or entity objected to the demolition within 30 days after the demolition
notice was both placed at the Property and mailed, after the City issued the
Permits, and after he caused or committed to payments totaling in excess of
$20,000 to consultants, contractors, and other third parties.  Bank Decl., ¶11.
Bank is informed and
believes that LADBS, or an agent acting on its behalf, affixed a Notice to Stop
Construction to a gate outside of the Property on an unknown date.  Bank Decl., ¶10.  During this period, there was a media frenzy
outside of the Property making it unsafe for Bank or his family to enter or
exit through the gate where the Notice was posted.  Bank Decl., ¶10.  He discovered the posted Notice of Stay sometime
later when his family was able to go outside in the pre-dawn hours.  Bank Decl., ¶10.  During that period, they could not even
comfortably go into the backyard of the Property because of the constant drones
and helicopters flying over the Property and disrupting their children. Bank
Decl., ¶10. The City later issued and mailed a
corrected notice on September 14, 2023. Sheridan Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. 30; Bank
Decl., ¶10, Ex. 12.
The nomination process was improperly handled by a biased
third party, Goers, arranged by the Los Angeles Conservancy and others
advocating for the designation. Sheridan Decl., Ex. 43. Goers, a board member
of Hollywood Heritage, prepared the nomination without proper authority and
despite her known bias.  Sheridan Decl.,
Ex. 38, Ex. 44. The Planning Department’s report to the Commission relied
entirely on this biased nomination. Sheridan Decl., Ex. 47. Councilmember Park
publicly supported the designation, stating on April 3, 2024, that she could
not imagine any home in Los Angeles more worthy of the designation.  Sheridan Decl., Ex. 50. 
After the City efforts
to designate the Property as a Historic Cultural Monument began, and to a much
greater extent than before, the small street where the Property is located (5th
Helena) and the surrounding area has become an unwanted tourist attraction,
endangering the safety and peace and quiet of the community.  Bank Decl., ¶12.  5th Helena is only 16 feet across at is
widest and barely 200 feet long, allowing virtually no room for parking of cars
of trucks anywhere along its length.  Bank Decl., ¶12. 
Bank has witnessed
people trying to enter the Property without permission (by scaling the wall and
gate), and they have flown drones over it.  Bank Decl., ¶13.  On April 14, 2024, a tour bus stopped at the
intersection of Carmelina and 5th Helena to observe the Property, obstructing
access to and from the narrow street leading to the Property. Bank Decl., ¶14,
Ex. 13.  
Many people have
parked their cars directly in front of the Property and stood on their cars to
try to look over the gate into the private Property, and several recently
boosted each other up onto and over the wall, requiring Bank’s family to call
the police yet again. Bank Decl., ¶15, Ex. 14. 
An unidentified person, whose car was parked directly in front of the
Property, reached into the Property’s mailbox.  Bank Decl., ¶16, Ex. 15.  Another unidentified person stood directly in
front of the security camera to display their Marilyn Monroe jacket.  Bank Decl., ¶17, Ex. 16.  
People have regularly
treated the Property as a place to film for their websites and social media.
Two unidentified persons placed a Marilyn Monroe cardboard cutout at Bank’s
gate to take pictures and film.  Bank Decl.,
¶20, Ex. 18.  
Recently, on April 8,
2024, at approximately 7:00 a.m., an unidentified person walked up the
cul-de-sac to the Property gate. The person displayed erratic movements, waived
whips violently towards the Property, and could be seen carrying a very large
weapon resembling a knife.  Bank Decl.,
¶18, Ex. 17.  Bank’s family called the police,
but they did not arrive timely enough to intercept the individual.  Id. 
The same person returned to the Property around 8:30 p.m. on April 8,
2024, and Bank’s family called the police again.  Bank Decl., ¶19.  Police officers were able to intercept the
person and asked him to move along from the Property. Unfortunately, he returned
to the Property around 3 :00 a.m., trying to open doorknobs on property gates
before eventually leaving again.  Bank
Decl., ¶19.
The City's
designation efforts have prompted persons to send threats and malicious
statements to Bank’s family via mail and social media.  Bank Decl., ¶21.  Local neighborhood groups have submitted
letters opposing designation of the Property as a Historical Cultural Monument,
among them the Brentwood Community Council (representing 36,000 stakeholders)
and various homeowners associations. Bank Decl., ¶22, Ex. 19. 
Bank and his wife
cannot even begin to estimate their damage if the City's intended designation
of the Property goes through. We will be mired in the heavy burden of owning,
perpetually, a tourist magnet creating a circus atmosphere harmful to us and
our neighbors.  Bank Decl., ¶23.
The PLUM Committee held a hearing and voted on March 5,
2024, to recommend the designation to the City Council. Sheridan Decl., Ex. 51.
Before the City Council could make a final decision, Petitioners requested and
received an extension, making June 16, 2024, the last day for City Council to
act on the designation.  Sheridan Decl., Ex.
52.  The City Council has until June 16,
2024, to make a final decision on the Historic Cultural Monument designation.
Sheridan Decl., Ex. 51.
 
2. City’s Evidence
On September 8, 2023, Councilmember Park, representing Council
District 11, moved pursuant to Rule 23 of the City Council Rules for immediate
action to consider the Property as a Historic Monument. Burman Decl., ¶5.  The motion identified the Property as “the
only residence owned by actress Marilyn Monroe” and noted that the demolition permit
had been issued on September 7, 2023.  Pet. RJN Ex. 41. 
The City Council unanimously approved the motion,
initiating the City’s process for the proposed designation of the Property as a
Historic Cultural Monument. Opp. RJN, Ex. E. That same day, under LAAC section
22.171.12, the City issued a temporary stay of the Permits and LADBS posted
notice of the stay on the Property’s gate. Opp. RJN, Ex. D.
The Commission sought to tour the Property as required by
LAAC section 22.171.8, but the tour was delayed until January 11 and 12, 2024
due to scheduling conflicts with Petitioners. Opp. RJN, Ex. C. 
On January 18, 2024, the Commission held a public hearing
on the proposed designation.  Ex. C,  Prior to the hearing, the Planning Department’s
Office of Historic Resources prepared a staff report recommending that the Commission
endorse the Historic Monument designation to the City Council.  Jones Decl., ¶¶ 2-4.

D. Analysis
Petitioners seek a preliminary injunction precluding the
City from moving forward with the Historic Cultural Monument designation process
for a home which they own and in which Marilyn Monroe lived for a short time.  
 
1. Availability of a Preliminary Injunction 
Petitioners seek to prevent the City from moving forward
with the Historic Monument process.  An injunction
is not available to prevent the execution of a public statute by officers of
the law for the public benefit.  See
Szold v. Medical Board, (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 591, 596.  The prohibition also does not apply if (1)
the statute is unconstitutional on its face or as applied, or (2) the public
official’s actions exceed his or her authority. 
See Conover v. Hall, (1974) 11 Cal.3d 842, 850.  A preliminary injunction prohibiting
enforcement of a valid ordinance on the ground that it was unconstitutionally
applied to the plaintiff should rarely be granted.  Xiloj-Itzep v. City of Agoura Hills,
(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 620, 636. 
Moreover, any available administrative remedy must be exhausted before
the statute is challenged, even on constitutional grounds.  Board of Police Commissioners v. Superior
Court, (1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 420, 431-32. 

Petitioners argue that they have vested rights and the
City’s stay of the Permits violates due process, as well as that the City
failed to follow the required process.  These
are matters for which they properly can seek to enjoin the City.  Petitioners also argue that Councilmember
Park has exhibited unacceptable bias (Mot. at 19-20), but this is not an issue
for which the City can be enjoined in a preliminary injunction.  See post.
 
2. Balancing of Irreparable Harms
In determining whether to issue a preliminary injunction,
the plaintiff must make some showing of each of the two factors of (1) a
reasonable probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the merits at trial
(CCP §526(a)(1)), and  (2) a balancing of
the “irreparable harm” that the plaintiff is likely to sustain if the
injunction is denied compared to the harm that the defendant is likely to
suffer if the court grants a preliminary injunction. CCP §526(a)(2); Jessen
v. Keystone Savings & Loan Assn., (1983) 142 Cal.App.3d 454, 459.  
“Irreparable harm” means that the defendant’s act
constitutes an actual or threatened injury to the personal or property rights
of the plaintiff that cannot be compensated by a damages award.  Brownfield v. Daniel Freeman Marina
Hospital, (1989) 208 Cal..App.3d 405, 410. 
The showing must demonstrate the specific harm claimed; mere allegations
of irreparable injury are insufficient.  Leach
v. City of San Marcos, (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 648, 661.  Conclusory statements, lay opinion, and
attorney declarations will not suffice. 
Preliminary injunctions are often denied on this ground.  The irreparable harm must be imminent; a mere
possibility or fear of harm is insufficient. 
Korean Philadelphia Presbyterian Church v. California Presbytery,
(2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1069, 1084.  A
significant showing of irreparable harm is required for an injunction against a
public officer or agency due to the general rule against enjoining them from
performing their duties.  Tahoe Keys
Property Owners Assn v. State Water Resources Control Board, (1994) 23
Cal.App.4th 1459, 1471.
In this case, Petitioners’ irreparable harm is the harm they
are likely to sustain without a preliminary injunction preventing the City
Council from hearing the Historic Cultural Monument issue on or before June 16.  Simply stating the issue suffices to show
that Petitioners will suffer virtually no harm. 
They merely have to wait less than two weeks, until June 16, to find out
whether the Property will be designated as a Historic Cultural Monument that
cannot be demolished.  
 Petitioners present evidence that, after the Historic
Cultural Monument issue arose, and to a much greater extent than before, they
and their neighbors have suffered from gawkers, trespassers, drones, tour
buses, parked cars, all disrupting the safety and peace and quiet of the
community.  Bank Decl., ¶12.  
This is
unfortunate.  The court accepts that,
even though the house has been known to the public (and Petitioners) to have
been owned by Marilyn Monroe, the disruption greatly increased after the
Historic Cultural Monument issue arose in September 2023.  However, there is nothing about this evidence
that significantly bears on any irreparable harm from completion of the
administrative process.  Indeed, a
preliminary injunction and resultant destruction of the home may increase
public attention to the Property and to Petitioners themselves on a short-term
basis.[8]  
Moreover, Petitioners have waited more than seven months through
the various pertinent events -- Councilmember Park’s motion initiating the
designation process and the stay on September 8, 2023, the nomination
application, the tour of the Property on January 11-12, 2024, the Commission
hearing on January 18, 2024, and the PLUM Committee hearing on March 5, 2024 --
to seek injunctive relief against the City’s administrative process.  Almost all Petitioners’ arguments of City
bias and unlawful action occurred at the beginning of this process and they
could have sought the same injunctive relief at that point.  A plaintiff’s delay in seeking a preliminary
injunction may constitute an admission of the lack of irreparable harm and a
basis for denial of the application for a preliminary injunction.  O’Connell v. Superior Court, (2006)
141 Cal.App.4th 1452, 1481; Nutro Products v. Cole Grain Co., (1992) 3
Cal.App.4th 860, 866.  Petitioners
provide no excuse for the delay.  See California
W. School of Law v. California W. University, (1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 1002,
1006.  Petitioners therefore have waived
any irreparable harm from completion of the administrative process.
The City’s irreparable harm is the harm that it is likely to
sustain from a preliminary injunction preventing completion of the Historic
Cultural Monument process by that date.  The
City will suffer significant harm from a preliminary injunction.  Whatever the outcome, the City, its residents,
and the public at large have a strong interest in the completion of
administrative proceedings.  If a
preliminary injunction is granted, Petitioners will exercise their Permits
rights and demolish the home on the Property and the administrative process
will never be completed.  If the City
Council would have granted Historic Cultural Monument status to the home, that
status will be permanently lost.  The
public also has an interest in knowing if the City Council would not have
granted Historic Monument status.
Balancing the harms, the City and public will suffer a
strong and irreparable harm if the process is disrupted and the home is
destroyed.  Petitioners will suffer
virtually no harm in waiting for a two-week period if the preliminary
injunction is denied.  Bank inadvertently
admitted this lack of harm in his declaration by stating that he and his wife
cannot even begin to estimate their damage if the City's intended
designation of the Property goes through because they will be mired in the
heavy burden of owning a tourist magnet creating a circus atmosphere harmful to
them and their neighbors.  Bank Decl.,
¶23.  These are harms that will result from
the adoption of Historic Cultural Monument status, not from the lack of
injunctive relief for a two-week period.
The balance of harms weighs almost completely in
favor of the City.  
 
3. Reasonable Probability of Success
A preliminary injunction may not issue unless the trial
court is persuaded that it is “reasonably probable” that the plaintiff will
prevail on the merits.  San Francisco
Newspaper Printing Co. v. Superior Court, (1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 438,
442.  The judge does not determine the
merits of the action or decide that the plaintiff necessarily will
prevail.  The judge only determines
whether there is a reasonable probability that the plaintiff will prevail.  Youngblood v. Wilcox, (1989) 207
Cal.App.3d 1368, 1372.
Petitioners raise issues that (a) they have vested statutory
rights under LAMC section 91.106.4.5.1 and by incurring expenses in reliance on
the Permits, (b) the City’s stay provision in LAAC section 22.171.12 violates
due process both facially and as-applied, and (c) the City’s process violated
its own procedures and Petitioners’ due process rights.  Given Petitioners’ lack of irreparable harm,
the court need not address these issues in detail. 
 
a. Vested Rights
Petitioners correctly state that there are two avenues for a
property owner’s vested rights to develop: (a) statute or ordinance (Davidson
v. County of San Diego, (“Davidson”) (19996) 49 Cal.App.4th 639,
647) and by performing substantial work and incurring substantial liabilities
in good faith reliance on a permit (Avco Community Developers, Inc. v. South
Coast Regional Commission, (1976) 17 Cal.3d 785, 791).  Mot. at 15.
Petitioners argue that both avenues apply.  First, the City conferred rights to
permittees in LAMC section 91.106.4.5.1., which creates a vested right once the
30-day hold period expires.  The City has
admitted that the 30-day hold period exists to address “preservation” issues.  Sheridan Decl., Exs. 34-35. As a result, the
City could not lawfully invoke the stay in LAAC section 22.171.12 after the
30-day hold expired.  Mot. at 15-16.
LAMC section 91.106.4.5.1’s language precludes LADBS from
issuing a permit for demolition of a building or structure more than 45 years
old without having sent written notices of the demolition pre-inspection
application by mail to abutting property owners and the Council District Office
for the site at least 30 days prior to issuance of the demolition permit or
structure permit.  This language exists
to allow adjacent property owners and the pertinent Council District Office
sufficient notice to take action on a proposed demolition, including to seek
historic preservation.  The ordinance
says nothing about the applicant property owner’s rights.  
Plainly, once the 30-day period in LAMC section 91.106.4.5.1
ends, LADBS may issue a demolition permit and a property owner is free to use
the permit to demolish a building or structure. 
But LAMC section 91.106.4.5.1 does not confer any right to do so, and
therefore is distinguishable from the case law cited by Petitioners such as Davidson,
supra, 49 Cal.App.4th at 648 (ordinance conferred right to zoning in
effect when building permit application was filed, but police power enabled
county to impair those vested rights when necessary to protect health and
safety).
Second, Petitioners argue that they acted in good faith
reliance on the Permits by engaging consultants, contractors, and third parties
for services, paying them over $20,000 for work.  Petitioners took these actions and made most
of the payments after the Permits were issued and before they received notice
of the City Council’s stay.  Mot. at 16.
This argument does not bear scrutiny.  Petitioners submitted an application for a
demolition permit on July 31, 2023, the Permits were issued on September 7,
2023, and the stay was issued the next day on September 8, 2023.  Thus, there was only one day in which
Petitioners could rely on the Permits.  The
City points out that, with the exception of a $269.25 payment on September 8, the
work and supporting invoices all occurred prior to issuance of the
Permits.  Opp. at 14.  Petitioners did not rely on the Permits to
make these payments.[9]
Aware of this problem, Petitioners argue that the City’s
illegal acts during September 6-8, 2023 resulted in the stay that prevented
them from incurring more expenses.  Mot.
at 16.  Whatever the reason for their
inaction, Petitioners did not incur substantial expense and effort in reliance
on the Permits.  
Petitioners have not shown that they have vested rights to
proceed with demolition under the Permits.
 
b. The Constitutionality of LAAC Section 22.171.12
Petitioners argue that LAAC section 22.171.12 violates due
process, both facially and as-applied to them.
A facial attack on the overall constitutionality of a
statute or ordinance “considers only the text of the measure itself, not its
application to the particular circumstances of an individual.”  Tobe, supra, 9 Cal.4th at 1084
(citation omitted).  Under a facial
challenge, the fact that the statute or ordinance “might operate
unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances is insufficient
to render it wholly invalid....”  Id.
(citing Sanchez v. City of Modesto, (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 660, 679).  If a statute is constitutional in its general
and ordinary application, it is not facially unconstitutional merely because
there might be some applications where it would impinge upon constitutional
rights.  City of San Diego v. Boggess,
(2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 1494, 1503 (citation omitted).  See also Sturgeon v. Bratton,
(2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 1407, 1418.  
Although the strictest standard
of facial unconstitutionality requires total and fatal conflict in every
circumstance, the courts have sometimes imposed a more lenient
standard.  The California Supreme Court
has acknowledged that it has “sometimes applied [the] more lenient standard,
asking whether the statute is unconstitutional ‘in the generality or great
majority of cases.’”  Gerawan
Farming, Inc. v. Agricultural Labor Relations Board, (2017) 3 Cal.5th
1118, 1138 (emphasis in original).  
A court considering a facial challenge to a procedural
scheme must determine whether the procedures “provide sufficient protection
against erroneous and unnecessary deprivations of liberty” and property.  Schall v. Martin, (1984) 467 U.S. 253,
274.  “A statute is presumed to be
constitutional and must be upheld unless its unconstitutionality clearly,
positively and unmistakably appears.”  Boyer
v. County of Ventura, (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 49, 54 (internal
quotations and citations omitted).  The
party challenging the constitutionality of a statute carries a “heavy
burden.”  City of Los Angeles v. Superior
Court, (2002) 29 Cal.4th 1, 10; Denham
v. Superior Court, (1970) 2 Cal.3d 557, 564.)  
Petitioners argue that LAAC section 22.171.12 violates due
process because it does not provide notice and an opportunity to be heard to
property owners before a stay is issue. 
Mot. at 17-18.  The City responds
that Petitioners are ignoring the notice and opportunity to be heard given
throughout the Historic Monument designation process, including at public
meetings held by the Commission, the PLUM Committee, and the City Council.  Opp. at 18. 
Petitioners describe this notice and opportunity as an after-the-fact
process that is irrelevant.  Reply at
7-8.
The issue presented is whether Petitioners were entitled to
notice and a hearing before a stay was imposed. 
Due process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the
particular situation demands.  Mathews
v. Eldridge, (1976) 424 U.S. 319, 333; Snelgrove v. Department of Motor
Vehicles, (1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 1364, 1376.  The California Supreme Court has concluded
that due process generally requires California state courts to consider four
factors: (1) the private interest that will be affected by the individual
action; (2) the risk of an erroneous deprivation of this interest through the
procedures used and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute
safeguards; (3) the dignitary interest of informing individuals of the nature,
grounds and consequences of the action and of enabling them to present their
side of the story before a responsible governmental official; and (4) the
government interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and
administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural
requirements would entail.  Oberholzer
v. Commission on Judicial Performance, (“Oberholzer”) (1999) 20
Cal.4th 371, 390-91, n. 16 (citing Mathews v. Eldridge, supra,
424 U.S. at 334).
A pre-deprivation hearing is not
always required to satisfy due process. 
“[W]hen prompt postdeprivation review is available for correction of
administrative error, we have generally required no more than that the
predeprivation procedures used be designed to provide a reasonably reliable
basis for concluding that the facts justifying the official action are as a
responsible governmental official warrants them to be.” Mackey v.
Montrym, (1979) 443
U.S. 1, 13 (pre-deprivation hearing not
required for 90-day suspension after refusal of a breath test because post-suspension
hearing was available immediately after driver's
suspension).  See also Dixon v. Love, (1977) 431 U.S. 105, 106, 115
(pre-deprivation hearing not required before state may summarily suspend or
revoke a license for drivers repeatedly convicted of traffic offenses where
there were “special provisions for hardship and for holders of commercial
licenses” and drivers were able to “obtain all the safeguards procedural due
process could be thought to require” through an evidentiary hearing  within 20 days).
The parties have not analyzed the factors required by Oberholzer
for a due process violation or the specific issues concerning pre- and post-deprivation
hearings.  Petitioners, therefore, have
not met their burden to show that LAAC section 22.171.12 is facially invalid.
As for Petitioners’ as-applied challenge, Petitioners do not
state when they learned about the stay effort. 
Bank states that he did not receive any advance notice of the City
Council’s September 8, 2023 motion (Bank Decl., ¶9), but he does not state he
was unaware of it.  He also states that
he discovered LADBS’ Notice to Stop Construction attached to a gate outside of
the Property on an unknown date (Bank Decl., ¶10), but again he does not state
when he learned of the stay’s existence. 
Given the media frenzy he describes (see Bank Decl., ¶10), he
plainly was aware of the stay before he found it on the gate.  Petitioners also do not discuss whether they
made any efforts to lift the stay or why their participation in the designation
process before the Commission and PLUM Committee have not sufficed.
As stated post, a preliminary injunction prohibiting
enforcement of a valid ordinance on the ground that it was unconstitutionally
applied to the plaintiff should rarely be granted.  Xiloj-Itzep v. City of Agoura Hills, supra,
24 Cal.App.4th at 636. A due process violation also requires a showing of
prejudice.  Krontz v. City of San Diego, (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th
1126, 1141 (delay in notice and opportunity to be heard requires
prejudice).   Petitioners have not shown
this is that rare occasion in which an ordinance (LAAC §22.171.12) has been applied
to them unconstitutionally and to their prejudice. 
 
c. The City’s Procedure
The pertinent procedure for Historic Monument designation
where, as here, the proposed designation has been issued by the City Council
(through Councilmember Park’s motion) is as follows.
The City Council, the Commission, or the Director may
initiate consideration of a proposed Historic Monument designation.  Any initiation by the City Council or
Commission shall be by majority vote.  The
City Council or the Commission shall forward the proposed designation to the
Director for a report and recommendation. 
LAAC §22.171.10(a).
Any interested individual may apply for a proposed
designation of a site, building, or structure as a Historical Monument.  The applicant shall complete the application
for the proposed designation on a form provided by the Planning Department,
include all information required, pay the required fee, and file the
application with the Planning Department. 
LAAC §22.171.10(b).
Upon receipt of a proposed designation initiated by the City
Council, the Commission shall, pursuant to LAAC section 22.171.8, inspect and
investigate the proposed designation. 
LAAC §22.171.10(c)(2).  As part of
this inspection and investigation, the Commission or staff shall, inter alia, tour or review
photographic/videographic records of the site and solicit opinions and
information from the office of the Council District in which the site is
located and from any City department or bureau whose operations may be affected
by designation of the site.  LAAC
§22.171.8. The Director shall thereafter prepare a report and recommendation on
the proposed designation.  LAAC
§22.171.10(c)(2).  After receipt of the
Director’s report, the Commission shall determine at a public meeting whether
the site, building, or structure conforms with the definition of a Historic
Monument.  LAAC §22.171.10(c)(2).  The Commission shall submit a report and
recommendation to the City Council.  If
the Commission recommends approval, the City Council may adopt the designation
by a majority vote.  LAAC
§22.171.10(c)(2).  If the Commission
recommends disapproval, the City Council may adopt the proposed designation by
a two-thirds vote.  Id.  The City Council shall act within the time
specified in LAAC section 22.171.10(f).
Petitioners
argue that the City violated the procedure required for Historic Monument
designation.  First, the Commission must
investigate under LAAC section 22.171.10. 
Yet, the City Council motion instructed the Planning Department to
prepare the nomination.  Mot. at 18.
The
City correctly responds that LAAC section 22.171.10(c)(2) requires the
Commission to inspect and investigate pursuant to LAAC section 22.171.8, which
requires “the Commission, its subcommittee or staff of the [Planning]
Department acting on behalf of the Commission” to inspect and investigate.  The Historic Resources Office of the Planning
Department may properly conduct the inspection and investigation on behalf of
the Commission.  Opp. at 19.
Second,
Petitioners argue that the Planning Department had the nomination application
prepared at no cost by a biased advocate for designation, Goers, and this
delegation was not permitted by LAAC section 22.171.10.  The Planning Department should have used one
of its listed consultants contracted to perform this task.  Sheridan Decl., Ex. 46.  Mot. at 18-19; Reply at 8-9.
As Petitioners note (Reply at 9), the City does not address
this issue. LAAC section 22.171.10(a) provides that the City Council may
initiate consideration of a proposed Historic Monument designation by majority
vote and then forward the proposed designation to the Director for a report and
recommendation.  LAAC §22.171.10(a).  LAAC section 22.171.10(b) provides that there
shall be a complete application for the proposed designation on a form provided
by the Planning Department, but it does not state who may prepare it.  
Petitioners concede that the application preparation may be
delegated to an outside third party but complains that Goers is not a
contracted consultant and was biased. 
Neither of these issues is directly addressed in LAAC section 22.171.10.
 The court has no opinion whether the use
of Goers was proper, but Petitioners have not adequately shown that it was
not.  
As
for the allegation of Goers’ bias, that is a due process issue, as is the
alleged bias of Councilmember Park.  Petitioners
allege that Councilmember Park actively and publicly prejudged the Historic
Cultural Monument issue, including appearing in a bizaare Marilyn Monroe
costume to give a long, prepared speech in favor of the nomination.  As a result, she is personally embroiled in
the designation.  Mot. at 10-11; Reply at
9.  The City answers that Councilmember
Park’s comments were based on her right and obligation to her constituents to
state her view on a matter of public importance.  Opp. at 17.
City
councilpersons are expected to voice opinions about quasi-legislative
decisions.  Petrovich Development
Company v. City of Sacramento, (2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 963, 973.  This is less true for quasi-legislative
decisions.  When functioning in a
quasi-adjudicaory capacity, the city council must be neutral and unbiased.  Id. (councilmember’s counting of votes
and reporting to mayor that he was confident that he had the vote to deny CUP
for gas station showed prehearing commitment). 
The City Council’s Historic Cultural Monument process appears to be quasi-legislative,
or at least Petitioners do not show it to be quasi-adjudicative. Therefore,
Councilmember Park appears to have been entitled to lobby for Historic Monument
designation pursuant to her obligations to her constituents.
In any event, the alleged bias of both Goers and
Councilmember Park in the Historic Monument designation process are due process
issues.  Prejudice will not be presumed;
actual prejudice must be shown in order to be balanced against a due process
violation.  People v. Belton, (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1425,
1433 (delay in filing criminal charges requires balancing of prejudice against
justification for delay).  “Reversible error requires demonstration of
prejudice arising from the reasonable probability the party ‘would have
obtained a better outcome’ in the absence of the error”.  Fisher
v. State Personnel Bd., (2018) 25 Cal.App.5th 1, 20. 
There has been no final outcome from which Petitioners could
show prejudice from the alleged bias of either Goers or Councilmember
Park.  Since both the Commission and the
PLUM Committee have acted, Goers’ alleged partisanship may have no bearing on
the outcome at all.  The City Council has
not finally acted, and it is unknown whether Councilmember Park will
participate or recuse herself from the vote. 
For this reason, a preliminary injunction cannot be based on allegations
of bias in the course of an as-yet not final administrative process.
Petitioners have not shown a reasonable prospect of success for
their claims.[10]
 
E.
Conclusion
Petitioners’ motion is an ill-disguised “motion to win” so
that they can demolish the home and eliminate the Historic Cultural Monument
issue.  That is not the purpose of a
preliminary injunction, which is to preserve the status quo pending
final judgment in the case.  See Scaringe
v. J.C.C. Enterprises, Inc. (1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 1536. Grothe v.
Cortlandt Corp. (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1313, 1316; Major v.
Miraverde Homeowners Assn. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 618, 623.  The motion for a preliminary injunction is denied.
