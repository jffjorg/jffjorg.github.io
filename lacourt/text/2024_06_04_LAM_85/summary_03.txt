**Case Number:** 24STCP01469

**Judge's Tentative Ruling:**

This document outlines the tentative ruling on the motion for preliminary injunction filed by the petitioners (Brinah Milstein and Roy Bank) against the City of Los Angeles. The petitioners seek to prevent the City from designating their property as a Historic Cultural Monument.

**Summary:**

1. The petitioners have shown a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits at trial, as they have demonstrated that the City's actions are arbitrary and capricious.
2. The petitioners have also shown that they will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is denied, as the designation will irreparably harm their property rights and create a nuisance.
3. The City
