MOTION TO
VACATE/SET ASIDE DEFAULT JUDGMENT

Los Angeles Superior Court Case # 23CHCV00006

 
Motion Filed: 9/20/23
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant Edith M. Wims (“Defendant”)
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Midland Credit
Management, Inc. (“Plaintiff”)
NOTICE: OK 
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order vacating the default judgment
entered against Defendant on 4/18/23.
 
TENTATIVE RULING: The unopposed motion is denied.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This is a collections case in which
Plaintiff, a collections agency, alleges that Defendant defaulted on her credit
account with non-party Capital One Bank USA, N.A. on 7/5/19, and currently owes
$27,104.21. (Compl. ¶¶ 5,
22.)
 
On 1/3/23, Plaintiff filed its
complaint against Defendant for Account Stated. On 4/6/23, default was entered
against Defendant. On 4/18/23, default judgment was entered against Defendant
in the total amount of $27,630.11.
 
On 9/12/23, Defendant filed an ex
parte application to set aside the default judgment against her, which the
Court denied. On 9/20/23, Defendant filed the instant noticed motion to set
aside the default judgment. No opposition has been filed to date.
 
ANALYSIS
 
“The court may, upon any terms as
may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a
judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her
through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application
for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading
proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted,
and shall be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months,
after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 473, subd. (b)
[emphasis added].)
 
Here, Defendant declares under
penalty of perjury that she was never served with the Summons and Complaint in
the instant action. (Decl. of Edith M. Wims ¶¶ 2, 8.) Defendant further declares that she was not
provided any additional notices regarding the further proceedings in the
action. (Id. at ¶¶
5–7.)
 
However, the 1/30/23 proof of service associated with the
complaint/summons states that D was personally served on 1/28/23, in direct
contradiction to her declaration. 
 
“The return of a [registered] process server … establishes a
presumption, affecting the burden of producing evidence, of the facts stated in
the return.” (Evid. Code § 647.) “The filing of a proof of service creates a
rebuttable presumption that the service was proper.” (Floveyor
International, Ltd. v. Superior Court (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 789, 795.)
 
Although Plaintiff has failed to oppose the instant motion/provide
additional evidence of service on Defendant, these motions are discretionary
when it comes to a party’s own mistake/inadvertence/surprise/neglect (as
opposed to compulsory re attorney mistake). To the extent that D is
attempting to quash service, she has missed the deadline to file that
particular motion.
 
The Court notes that Defendant has
failed to attach a copy of her proposed Answer to Plaintiff’s complaint. For
the reasons set forth above, the Court denies Defendant’s motion to set aside
the default/default judgment entered against her without prejudice.
 
CONCLUSION 
 
The unopposed motion is denied.
