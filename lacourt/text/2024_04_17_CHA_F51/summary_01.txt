And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's unopposed motion to set aside the default judgment entered against her. The defendant claims that she was never served with the summons and complaint, and that she did not receive any additional notices regarding further proceedings. However, the proof of service associated with the complaint/summons states that the defendant was personally served on January 28, 2023, which contradicts her declaration. The court notes that the defendant has failed to attach a copy of her proposed answer to the plaintiff's complaint, and that she has missed the deadline to file a motion to quash service. The court has denied the defendant's motion without prejudice.
