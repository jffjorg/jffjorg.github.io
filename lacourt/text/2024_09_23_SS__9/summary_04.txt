And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled on a petition for a name change, citing concerns about the clarity of the criminal history assessment provided by the Clerk's Office. The assessment indicates that the Petitioner is not a registered sex offender, but the notation provided by the Clerk's Office is unclear and ambiguous. The Judge has ordered the Clerk's Office to re-run the criminal history assessment and provide a more clear notation on whether the Petitioner has any convictions, including those requiring sex offender registration. The Petition has been continued to September 30, 2024 at 9:30 am to allow for the re-run assessment and clarification of the notation. The Name Change Clerk has been ordered to run and complete the criminal history assessment prior to the continued hearing.
