 Case Number:  24STCP02018    Hearing Date:   September 23, 2024    Dept:  9 On August 19, 2024, the Court noted
that Petitioner had submitted a proposed decree that is illegible and difficult
to read.  Accordingly, the Court ordered
Petitioner to file a new proposed decree that was either typed or neatly
printed so that there is clarity as to the new name 10 days prior to the continued
hearing date.  (Minute Order
8/19/24.)  However, Petitioner failed to
do so.  Therefore, the petition is
dismissed without prejudice.  Petitioner
may file a new petition with a legible decree.
 
Court Clerk to give notice.
