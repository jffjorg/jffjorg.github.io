The judge's tentative ruling grants the petition to change name for the Petitioner. The Petitioner must review the proposed decree to ensure the new name is clearly written and correctly spelled. If the new name meets these criteria, no appearance is required at the hearing. However, if the new name is not legible or spelled correctly, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name. A copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date.
