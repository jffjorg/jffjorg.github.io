And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is related to a petition to change name. The petitioner must review the proposed decree to ensure the new name is correctly spelled and legible. If the name is correct, the petitioner does not need to appear at the hearing. However, if the name is not clear or correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The petition is granted, and a signed copy of the decree will be available in the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition.
