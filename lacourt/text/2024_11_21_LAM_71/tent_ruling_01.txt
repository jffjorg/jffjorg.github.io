CRAIG STEVEN ROBERTS, et al.,
 
  
         vs.
 
DOES 1 THROUGH 250.


 Case No.:  20STCV20443
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  November 21, 2024



 
Defendant Slurry Explosive Corporation’s motion to deem the truth
of the matters admitted and the genuineness of the documents specified therein
in Defendant Slurry Explosive Corporation’s Request for Admissions (Set One)
served on Plaintiff Craig Steven Roberts is denied as moot.
Defendant Slurry
Explosive Corporation’s request for sanctions against Plaintiff Craig Steven
Roberts is denied.

          
          Defendant Slurry
Explosive Corporation (“Slurry”) (“Moving Defendant”) moves for an order
deeming the truth of all matters specified in Request for Admissions (Set One)
(“RFA”) and the genuineness of documents specified therein, served on Plaintiff
Craig Steven Roberts (“Craig”) (“Plaintiff”).  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2.)  Moving Defendant also requests an award of
sanctions in the amount of $1,270.00.  (Notice
of Motion, pg. 2.)
Having reviewed Moving Defendant’s Motion to Deem Admitted the RFAs to Craig,
the Court rules as follows.
          On July 5, 2024, Moving
Defendant served RFA (Set One) on Craig. 
(Decl. of Sologub ¶2, Exh. A.) 
Craig’s written responses were due no later than August 6, 2024.  Moving Defendant now moves to deem admitted
the RFAs.  
          Moving Defendant’s motion
to deem the truth of the matters specified in its RFA to Craig and the
genuineness of all documents specified therein is denied as moot on the basis
Craig served responses to the RFAs on November 7, 2024.  (Decl. of Brust ¶7, Exh. A.)[1]
Moving Defendant requests monetary sanctions totaling $1,270.00.  Moving Defendant’s notice of
motion fails to identify against whom sanctions are sought or to specify the
statute authorizing the sanctions, such that a grant of sanctions would deprive
Craig of due process.  (Code of Civil Procedure
section 2023.040.)  Therefore, the Court
denies the request for sanctions.  
Moving Party is to give notice of this ruling.
