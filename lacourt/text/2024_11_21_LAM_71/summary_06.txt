Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has sustained Defendant Fountain9, Inc.'s demurrer to Plaintiff Rebeka Rodriguez's second amended complaint (SAC) without leave to amend. The Judge found that the SAC fails to state a claim under California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA) because it does not allege a concrete injury-in-fact, and the alleged injury is abstract and hypothetical. The Judge also found that the SAC fails to adequately plead the element of causation, and a mere allegation of injury without a reasonable relationship to Defendant's acts is grounds for a demurrer. The Judge denied Defendant's motion to strike as moot in light of the ruling on the demurrer.
