[1] The Court notes Plaintiff’s two filed oppositions are
improperly noted on the instant docket as “Memorandum of Points and
Authorities.” The filings are not labeled as oppositions to Defendant’s
respective motions.  The Court
previously admonished Plaintiff for this same mislabeling error on July 7, 2024.  Plaintiff’s intransigence in correcting this
filing error runs the risk of this Court not reviewing future improperly
labeled filings.  Most importantly, Plaintiff’s
opposition to Defendant’s demurrer appears to be the same document filed in
opposition to the demurrer to the FAC.
