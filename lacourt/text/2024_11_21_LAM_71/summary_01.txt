And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Slurry Explosive Corporation's motion to deem the truth of the matters admitted and the genuineness of documents specified in their Request for Admissions (Set One) served on Craig Steven Roberts, citing that Craig has already served responses to the RFAs on November 7, 2024, making the motion moot. The judge has also denied Slurry's request for sanctions in the amount of $1,270.00, as the notice of motion failed to identify against whom sanctions are sought and did not specify the statute authorizing the sanctions, which would deprive Craig of due process.
