TENTATIVE RULING
 



REBEKA RODRIGUEZ,  
  
         vs.
 
FOUNTAIN9, INC.


 Case No.: 
  24STCV04504
 
 
 
 Hearing
  Date:  November 21, 2024



 
Defendant Fountain9, Inc.’s demurrer to Plaintiff Rebeka
Rodriguez’s second amended complaint is sustained without
leave to amend.
Defendant Fountain9, Inc.’s
motion to strike portions of Plaintiff’s second amended complaint is denied as
moot.
 
Defendant Fountain9, Inc. (“Fountain9”) (“Defendant”) demurs to
each cause of action in Plaintiff Rebeka Rodriguez’s (“Rodriguez”) (“Plaintiff”) second
amended complaint (“SAC”) on the grounds Plaintiff’s purported cause of action
for violation of Penal Code §638.51 fails to state a cause of action under
settled principles of California law and on grounds that Plaintiff’s consent to
the acts complained of appears on the face of the complaint, where lack of
consent is either an element of Plaintiff’s cause of action or alternatively
where consent is an affirmative defense. 
(Notice of
Demurrer, pgs. 1-2; C.C.P. §430.10(e).) 
Defendant also filed a motion to strike portions of Plaintiff’s SAC.  (Notice of MTS, pgs. 1-2.)
 
Request for Judicial Notice
Defendant’s 9/13/24
request for judicial notice of Plaintiff’s first amended complaint (“FAC”) is
denied on the basis this Court does not need to take judicial notice of filings
on the instant docket.
Plaintiff’s 11/7/24 request for judicial notice of (1) the Senate Committee on Public Safety Bill Analysis of Apr.
12, 2010, for Senate Bill No. 1428 (2009-2010 Regular Session) (P-RJN, Exh. 1);
and (2) Assembly Committee on Public Safety Bill Analysis of June 21, 2010, for
Senate Bill No. 1428 (2009-2010 Regular Session) (P-RJN, Exh. 2) is granted.
Plaintiff’s 11/7/24 request for judicial notice of (1) Minute
Order filed on August 11, 2023, in Licea v. Jockey Int’l, Inc., No.
23STCV02906 (Cal. Super. Ct., Los Angeles County Aug. 11, 2023) (Richardson,
J.); (2) Minute Order filed on April 3, 2024, in Levings v. Choice Hotels
Int’l, Inc., No. 23STCV28359, 2024 WL 1481189 (Cal. Super. Ct. L.A. Cty.
Apr. 3, 2024) (Nellon, J.); and (3) Minute Order filed on June 4, 2024, in Sanchez
v. Weber-Stephen Products LLC, No. 24STCV00217 (Cal. Super. Ct. L.A. Cty.
June 4, 2024) (Nellon, J.) is denied.
 
Meet and Confer
Before filing a
demurrer, the demurring party must meet and confer in person, by telephone,
or by video conference with the party who filed the pleading to attempt to
reach an agreement that would resolve the objections to the pleading and
obviate the need for filing the demurrer.  (C.C.P. §430.41(a), emphasis added.)
The demurring party
shall file and serve with the demurrer a declaration stating either of the
following: (A) The means by which the demurring party met and conferred with
the party who filed the pleading subject to demurrer, and that the parties did
not reach an agreement resolving the objections raised in the demurrer. (B)
That the party who filed the pleading subject to demurrer failed to respond to
the meet and confer request of the demurring party or otherwise failed to meet
and confer in good faith.  (C.C.P.
§430.41(a)(3).)
Defendant’s counsel declares
that the parties met and conferred by telephone on September 12, 2024, and the
issues raised in the instant motion were unresolved.  (See Decl. of Farrow ¶2.)  Defendant’s meet and confer declaration
satisfies the requirements of C.C.P. §430.41(a)(3).  Therefore, the Court will consider
Defendant’s demurrer.
 
Background
Plaintiff filed her initial complaint (“Complaint”) on February
22, 2024.  Plaintiff filed her FAC on
April 18, 2024.  On July 9, 2024, this
Court sustained Defendant’s demurrer to the FAC with 20 days leave to
amend.  (7/9/24 Minute Order.)  
Plaintiff filed the operative SAC against Defendant alleging a
single cause of action for violation of the California Invasion of Privacy Act
(“CIPA”), Penal Code §638.51(a).
Plaintiff alleges she is a consumer privacy advocate who works as
a “tester” to ensure that companies abide by the privacy obligations imposed by
California law.  (SAC
¶4.)  Plaintiff alleges Defendant is
a provider of inventory software to clients throughout California and in this County.  (SAC ¶5.) 
Plaintiff alleges Defendant owns and operates www.fountain9.com
(“Website”).  (SAC ¶46.)  Plaintiff alleges Defendant has incorporated
the code of the PR/TT beacon into the code of its Website.  (SAC ¶50.)  Plaintiff alleges that when she visited
the Website, the Website caused the PR/TT beacon to be installed on her and
other users’ browsers.  (SAC ¶50.)  
Plaintiff alleges upon installing the PR/TT on its Website,
Defendant uses the PR/TT to collect the IP address of visitors to the Website,
which is used by the PR/TT beacon’s developer to provide services to Defendant
and its other clients, including targeted advertisements and website analytics.
 (SAC ¶52.)  Plaintiff alleges Defendant and
its partners use the PR/TT beacon to “digitally fingerprint” each visitor.  (SAC ¶52.)  Plaintiff alleges that at no time prior
to the installation and use of the PR/TT beacon on Plaintiff’s and other users’
browsers, or prior to the use of the PR/TT beacon, did Defendant procure
Plaintiff’s or other users’ consent for such conduct.  (SAC
¶53.)  Plaintiff alleges
Defendant did not obtain a court order to install or use the PR/TT beacon.  (SAC ¶53.) 
Plaintiff alleges the specific PR/TT spyware beacons detected
on Defendant’s Website are (1) ShareThis.com; (2) Nexxen; (3) Neustar; (4)
OnAudience; (5) Pippio; (6) TapAd; (7) Dun & Bradstreet – d41.co; (8)
Lotame – crwdcntrl.com; (9) Eyeota; (10) Adobe/Demdex; (11) Live Intent; (12)
The Trade Desk; (13) Bombora –ml314.com; (14) SiteScout.com; and (15) Live Ramp
/ RapLeaf.  (SAC ¶54.)  
Plaintiff alleges she has visited the Website within the
applicable statute of limitations period via an Internet-connected computer,
and her visit occurred in January 2024.  (SAC
¶94.)  Plaintiff alleges that
when she visited the Website, the Website’s code—as programmed by
Defendant—caused the PR/TT beacon to be installed on Plaintiff’s browser.  (SAC ¶95.) 
Plaintiff alleges Defendant and the PR/TT beacon’s developer
then used the PR/TT beacon to collect Plaintiff’s IP address.  (SAC ¶95.)  Plaintiff alleges Defendant and the PR/TT
beacon’s developer used the information collected by the PR/TT beacon to
analyze Website data and marketing campaigns, conduct targeted advertising, and
ultimately boost Defendant’s and/or advertisers’ revenue.  (SAC ¶96.)  

Plaintiff alleges she did not provide her prior consent to
Defendant to install or use the PR/TT beacon on her browser.  (SAC ¶97.)  Plaintiff alleges Defendant did not
obtain a court order before installing or using the PR/TT beacon.  (SAC ¶98.) 
Plaintiff alleges Defendant knowingly and intentionally deployed PR/TT
spyware to (1) decode and record the routing, addressing, and signaling
information transmitted by Plaintiff’s electronic device communication; and (2)
capture the incoming electronic or other impulses that identify the originating
number or other dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information
reasonably likely to identify the source of a wire or electronic communication
as part of its identity resolution efforts. 
(SAC ¶100.) 
Plaintiff alleges this conduct constitutes illegal
installation of PR/TT spyware in violation of California law.  (SAC ¶100.) 

Defendant filed the instant demurrer and accompanying motion to
strike on September 17, 2024.  Plaintiff
filed her oppositions on November 7, 2024.[1]  As of the date of this
hearing no reply has been filed.
          
A.   Demurrer
Summary of Demurrer
Defendant demurs to Plaintiff’s SAC on the grounds that Plaintiff
does not allege that Defendant caused her any concrete injury-in-fact.  (Demurrer, pg. 4.)  Defendant argues the
alleged “beacon” or “cookie” that Plaintiff claims was installed on her browser
is not a “pen register” as defined by Penal Code §638.51.  (Demurrer, pg. 6.)  Defendant argues the SAC is unintelligible at
paragraphs 55-89.  (Demurrer, pg. 8.)  Defendant further argues the SAC is a sham
pleading in that the allegations regarding consent have been excised from the
SAC.  (Demurrer, pgs. 9-10.)
 
Legal Standard
“[A] demurrer tests the legal
sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc.
(2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  A
demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable.  (See Donabedian v.
Mercury Insurance Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a
demurrer, a court may not consider declarations, matters not subject to
judicial notice, or documents not accepted for the truth of their
contents].)  For purposes of ruling on a
demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed to be true, but the
reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of law.  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital District
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
 
Failure to State a Claim
CIPA, Penal Code §638.51(a) (1st COA)
CIPA §638.51(a) provides: “Except as
provided in subdivision (b), a person may not install or use a pen register or
a trap and trace device without first obtaining a court order pursuant to
Section 638.52 or 638.53.”  (Pen. Code
§638.51(a).)
Plaintiff alleges she brings this cause of action individually
against Defendant.  (SAC ¶108.) 
Plaintiff alleges the PR/TT beacon is a “pen
register” because it is a “device or process” that “capture[d]” the “routing,
addressing, or signaling information”—the IP address—from the electronic communications
transmitted by Plaintiff’s computer or smartphone.  (SAC ¶112.) 

Plaintiff alleges at all relevant times, Defendant knowingly
installed the PR/TT beacon—which is a pen register—on Plaintiff’s browser and
used the PR/TT beacon to collect Plaintiff’s IP address, and track Plaintiff.  (SAC ¶113.)  Plaintiff alleges the PR/TT beacon
does not collect the content of Plaintiff’s electronic communications with the
Website.  (SAC ¶114.)  Plaintiff alleges she did not
provide Plaintiff’s prior consent to Defendant’s installation or use of the PR/TT
beacon.  (SAC ¶115.)  Plaintiff alleges Defendant did
not obtain a court order to install or use the PR/TT beacon.  (SAC ¶116.) 

Plaintiff alleges pursuant to §637.2 of the California Penal Code,
Plaintiff has been injured by Defendant’s violation of §638.51(a) of the
California Penal Code and seeks statutory damages of $5,000 for Defendant’s
violation of §638.51(a).  (SAC ¶117.)
          Plaintiff fails to
allege a concrete injury-in-fact.  Plaintiff
claims that she “suffered an injury to her dignity” and “suffered the loss of
her anonymity” as a result of Defendant’s “wrongdoing” and the wrongdoing of
third parties.  (SAC ¶102.)  As in the FAC, Plaintiff alleges that the only
“personal information” that Defendant collected was her IP address, which in
itself provides no information about the user as it consists merely as a string
of umbers.  (SAC ¶¶34, 41, 95.)
Plaintiff’s allegation of injury still fails to meet the
“concrete” injury required for standing.  (Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins (2016) 578 U.S.
330, 339-340.)  The alleged injury is
abstract and hypothetical because it is solely premised on statutory damages
under CIPA.  (TransUnion LLC v.
Ramirez (2021) 141 S.Ct. 2190, 2199 [“No concrete harm, no
standing.”]; id. at pgs. 2209-2210 [holding that plaintiffs who alleged
a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) lacked standing because
their inaccurate credit files were not disclosed to any potential creditor and
therefore plaintiffs did not suffer an injury in fact]; see Limon v.
Circle K Stores, Inc. (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 671, 703-707
[finding no standing on sole allegation of statutory damages under FCRA].)
          Further,
Plaintiff fails to adequately plead the element of causation given the facts
alleged. When the facts as alleged do not give rise to an inference that the
claimed injury would naturally result from the alleged wrongful conduct,
Plaintiff must allege with specificity how exactly the alleged wrongful conduct
could have caused the alleged injury. A mere allegation of injury without a
reasonable relationship to Defendant’s acts is grounds for a demurrer.  (Bockrath v.
Aldrich Chemical Co. (1999), 21 Cal.4th
71, 78-79.)
          Accordingly,
Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s 1st cause of action is sustained without
leave to amend.
 
B.    Motion to Strike
In light of the Court’s ruling on Defendant’s demurrer,
Defendant’s motion to strike is denied as moot.
 
Conclusion
Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s SAC is sustained without
leave to amend.
Defendant’s motion to strike is denied as moot. 
Moving Party to give notice.
