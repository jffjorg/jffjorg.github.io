Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The defendant, Ronald Peak, had argued that there is no dispute of genuine material fact as to any cause of action because he has paid the plaintiff, Bennett Georgen, in full for the purchase of the property. The plaintiff had agreed to dismiss the case as a condition of the sale, and the property was transferred to the defendant. The defendant presented evidence that he paid the agreed-upon purchase price in full and that the deed transferring the property from the plaintiff to the defendant was recorded. The plaintiff did not file an opposition to the motion, and the judge therefore granted the motion.
