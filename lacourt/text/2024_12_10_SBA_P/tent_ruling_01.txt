  Case Number:  22TRCV00328    Hearing Date:   December 10, 2024    Dept:  P Motion for Summary JudgmentMoving Party: Defendant Ronald PeakResponding Party: NoneRULINGHaving considered the moving papers, Defendant’s motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.PROCEDURAL BACKGROUNDOn April 29, 2022, Plaintiff Bennett Georgen (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Ronald Peak (“Defendant”) and all other persons claiming any interest in the Property, alleging causes of action for (1) Breach of Written note; (2) Quiet Title; and (3) Declaratory Relief.On December 19, 2022, Defendant filed a cross-complaint against Plaintiff.On September 24, 2024, Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, or in the alternative, summary adjudication. As of December 6, 2024, no opposition has been filed.FACTUAL BACKGROUNDOn May 30, 2000, Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a Purchase Agreement for the purchase and sale of a property located at 404 S. Juanita Ave., Redondo Beach, CA 90277 (the “Property”). (UMF No. 1.) The Purchase Agreement required Defendant to make monthly installment payments. (Complaint, ¶ 10.)On June 1, 2021, Defendant failed to make the required monthly payment. (Complaint, ¶ 12.) As of November 2023, Defendant owed Plaintiff $1,177,885.00. (UMF No. 2.)On January 3, 2024, Plaintiff obtained a $1,169,000.00 loan secured by a Deed of Trust recorded against the Property. (UMF No. 3.)On July 10, 2024, Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a Residential Purchase Agreement for Defendant to purchase the Property for $1,285,000.00. (UMF No. 4.) As a condition to close escrow on August 7, 2024, Plaintiff agreed to dismiss the pending case against Defendant. (UMF No. 5.)Escrow closed on August 14, 2024, and Plaintiff was paid in full. (UMF No. 6.) A deed transferring the Property to Defendant was recorded. (UMF No. 6.)Defendant has asked Plaintiff to dismiss the case, pursuant to their agreement, but Plaintiff has refused. (UMF No. 7.)LEGAL STANDARDIn reviewing a motion for summary judgment, courts must apply a three-step analysis: “(1) identify the issues framed by the pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has negated the opponent’s claims; and (3) determine whether the opposition has demonstrated the existence of a triable, material factual issue.” (Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.)“[T]he initial burden is always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no triable issues of material fact.” (Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) A defendant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication “has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action . . . cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) A moving defendant need not conclusively negate an element of plaintiff’s cause of action. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 854.)To meet this burden of showing a cause of action cannot be established, a defendant must show not only “that the plaintiff does not possess needed evidence” but also that “the plaintiff cannot reasonably obtain needed evidence.” (Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 854.) It is insufficient for the defendant to merely point out the absence of evidence. (Gaggero v. Yura (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 884, 891.) The defendant “must also produce evidence that the plaintiff cannot reasonably obtain evidence to support his or her claim.” (Ibid.) The supporting evidence can be in the form of affidavits, declarations, admissions, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and matters of which judicial notice may be taken. (Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 855.) “Once the defendant . . . has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.”(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) The plaintiff may not merely rely on allegations or denials of its pleadings to show that a triable issue of material fact exists, but instead, “shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to the cause of action.” (Ibid.) “If the plaintiff cannot do so, summary judgment should be granted.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 463, 467.)DISCUSSIONMoving Party’s ArgumentPlaintiff agreed to dismiss the case in full as a condition of the sale of property to Defendant. Plaintiff has been paid in full, and thus the case should have been dismissed.Request for Judicial NoticeDefendant seeks judicial notice of two documents, a Deed of Trust recorded on February 5, 2024 and a Grant Deed transferring the Property from Plaintiff to Defendant. Both documents are recorded with the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office.The court may take notice of the official acts of any legislative, executive, or judicial body in any state, pursuant to Evid. Code section 452, subd. (c).Accordingly, Defendant’s request for judicial notice is GRANTED.Merits of the MotionDefendant argues that there is no dispute of genuine material fact as to any cause of action because Defendant has paid Plaintiff in full for the purchase of the Property. Further, Plaintiff agreed to dismiss the instant case as a condition of escrow, which closed on August 14, 2023.In support, Defendant offers his own declaration, the declaration of Nickie Bento (“Bento”), a Deed of Trust, and a Grant Deed. Bento declares that he was the escrow officer in the transaction whereby Plaintiff sold the Property to Defendant. (Bento Decl., ¶ 2.) As part of escrow, Plaintiff was required to submit a letter stating that he would dismiss the lawsuit against Defendant upon the close of the transaction. (Bento Decl., Exh. 3.)Defendant declares that he paid the agreed upon purchase price in full on August 14, 2024, and the deed transferring the Property form Plaintiff to Defendant was recorded on the same day. (Peak Decl., ¶ 6; RJN, Exh. B.) Defendant also provides the Final Closing Statement to support his contention that Plaintiff was paid in full. (Peak Decl., Exh. 4.)Defense counsel also provides Plaintiff’s deposition responses as Exhs. 5-6 of her declaration. Such documents show that Defendant, as of November 2023, owed Plaintiff $1,177,885.00. (Kendall Decl., Exh. 6.) On August 14, 2024, Defendant paid $1,285,000.00 to cover the balance and obtain title to the Property. (Peak Decl., Exh. 2.)Thus, Defendant has met his burden of showing that there is no triable issue of material fact, as he has paid Plaintiff in full, Plaintiff transferred the Property to Defendant, and Plaintiff was obligated to dismiss the case as a condition of escrow. Accordingly, the burden shifts to Plaintiff to show that there is a triable issue of material fact.As Plaintiff has not filed an opposition, he does not meet his burden. In addition, the court exercises its discretion under Code Civ. Proc. section 437c, subd. (b)(3) to grant Defendant’s motion for Plaintiff’s failure to oppose it.CONCLUSIONBased on the foregoing, the court GRANTS the motion for summary judgment.Prevailing party on motion is ordered to give notice of ruling.
