And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the moving papers and opposition and has denied Plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration. The motion was made because the court sustained the demurrer and motion to strike without leave to amend.

The procedural background of the case includes the filing of a complaint by Plaintiffs, a demurrer by Defendant South Park Doggie, Inc., and a demurrer and motion to strike by Nayebdadash Defendants. The court sustained the demurrer and motion to strike without leave to amend, and Plaintiffs have filed a motion to reconsider.

The facts of the case include that Plaintiffs' dog, Skye, was attacked and killed by Moving Defendants' dogs on August 9, 2022, and that Moving Defendants knew of their dogs' propensity for violence and trained them to be vicious and unruly. The court finds that Plaintiffs have not presented new law or new facts that would warrant reconsideration.

The court also finds that it lacks jurisdiction to reconsider its ruling as to South Park Doggie, Inc. since it was dismissed from the case. Therefore, the court denies Plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration in its entirety.
