 Case Number:  23PSCV03140    Hearing Date:   December 4, 2024    Dept:  6 Defendant  Chedraui USA, Inc. dba El Super’s Demurrer to the First Amended Complaint  TENTATIVE  RULING  The Court SUSTAINS the demurrer of Defendant Chedraui USA, Inc.,  dba El Super to the First and Second Causes of Action of Plaintiffs’ First  Amended Complaint without leave to amend. The Court directs Chedraui USA, Inc.  dba El Super to submit a proposed order of dismissal for the Court’s review and  signature.   Chedraui USA, Inc. dba El Super is ordered to give notice of the  Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.   BACKGROUND              This is a wrongful death case. On October  10, 2023, plaintiffs Manuel Valdez, Chelsea Valdez-Gutierrez, Manuel Alexander  Valdez, Daisy Valdez, Yvette Gutierrez Valdez, Maria Gutierrez, Estate of  Rosalva Valdez, by and through its administrator, Manuel Valdez (collectively,  Plaintiffs) filed this action. On September 9, 2024, after the Court sustained  a demurrer to the complaint, Plaintiffs filed the operative First Amended  Complaint (FAC) against defendants Chedraui USA, Inc., dba El Super (El Super),  HB Property Management, Inc., Priority Property Group Inc. (Priority), Oscar  Gonzalez, George Gonzalez, and Does 1 through 50, alleging causes of action for  wrongful death (negligence) and survival. On October 30, 2024, the Court  sustained Priority’s demurrer to the First and Second Causes of Action of the  FAC without leave to amend.   On March 1,  2024, Defendant Chedraui USA, Inc., dba El Super filed a cross-complaint. On  September 11, 2024, after the Court sustained in part a demurrer to the  cross-complaint, El Super filed its operative First Amended Cross-Complaint  against cross-defendants Oscar Gonzalez, George Gonzalez, Covina Marketplace,  LLC, Priority Property Group Inc., and Roes 4 through 20, alleging causes of  action for express indemnity, equitable indemnity, comparative indemnity, and  declaratory relief.   On May 29,  2024, defendant Covina Marketplace, LLC (Covina Marketplace) filed a  cross-complaint. On August 9, 2024, Covina Marketplace filed its operative  First Amended Cross-Complaint against El Super, Oscar Gonzalez, George  Gonzalez, and Roes 1 through 20, alleging causes of action for express written  indemnity, full or partial equitable indemnification, declaratory relief, and  apportionment.   On November  8, 2024, El Super filed a demurrer to the FAC. On November 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed  an opposition. On November 25, 2024, El Super filed a reply.  LEGAL  STANDARD  A demurrer is a  pleading used to test the legal sufficiency of other pleadings.¿It raises  issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or content of the opposing party's  pleading (complaint, answer or cross-complaint).¿(Code Civ. Proc., § 422.10;  see Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994  (Donabedian).) It is not the function of the demurrer to challenge the  truthfulness of the complaint; and for purposes of ruling on the demurrer, all  facts pleaded in the complaint are assumed to be true.¿(Id. at pp. 993-994.)  A demurrer can be used  only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack;  or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v.  Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian, supra, 116 Cal.App.4th at p.  994.)¿No other extrinsic evidence can be considered.¿(Ion Equip. Corp. v.  Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 881 [error for court to consider facts  asserted in memorandum supporting demurrer]; see also Afuso v. United States  Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862, disapproved on other  grounds in Moradi-Shalal v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d 287  [error to consider contents of release not part of court record].)  A demurrer can be  utilized where the “face of the complaint” itself is incomplete or discloses  some defense that would bar recovery. (Guardian North Bay, Inc. v. Superior  Court (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 963, 971-972.)¿The “face of the complaint” includes  material contained in attached exhibits that are incorporated by reference into  the complaint, or in a superseded complaint in the same action. (Frantz v.  Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94; see also Barnett v. Fireman’s Fund Ins.  Co. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 500, 505 [“[W]e rely on and accept as true the  contents of the exhibits and treat as surplusage the pleader’s allegations as  to the legal effect of the exhibits”].)  A demurrer can only be  sustained when it disposes of an entire pleading, cause of action, or  affirmative defense. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1320, subd. (a); Poizner  v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of  Hawaiian Gardens Redev. Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046-1047.)  PRELIMINARY ISSUE   The Court notes that El  Super’s demurrer combines the grounds for demurrer for each cause of action  into one paragraph in violation of Rule 3.1320, subdivision (a), of the  California Rules of Court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1320, subd. (a).) The  Court will still consider the demurrer, but admonishes El Super to comply  with the requirements of the California Rules of Court going forward.   The Court also notes that  El Super’s demurrer is untimely. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 430.40, subd. (a).)  The FAC was filed on September 9, 2024. Priority demurred to the FAC on October  1, 2024. El Super attempted to join that demurrer on October 22, 2024, but the  Court denied the joinder as untimely in part because it was well after the  demurrer deadline. El Super filed this demurrer almost two months after  Plaintiffs filed the FAC and more than one month after Priority demurred to the  FAC. Nevertheless, Plaintiffs did not raise this issue in their opposition.  Accordingly, the Court exercises its discretion to still consider the demurrer,  but admonishes El Super to comply with the requirements of the Code of Civil  Procedure going forward. (Jackson v. Doe (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 742, 749  [trial court has discretion to consider late-filed demurrer].)   DISCUSSION  Meet and Confer              Per Code of  Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a), El Super was required to meet  and confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference before bringing this  demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).) The Court finds El Super’s  efforts to meet and confer sufficient. (Gardiner Decl., ¶¶ 3-6.)  First Cause of Action – Wrongful Death   To state a cause of action for wrongful death, the  plaintiff must allege facts demonstrating a wrongful act or neglect on the part  of one or more persons that caused the death of another person. (Musgrove v.  Silver (2022) 82 Cal.App.5th 694, 705.)   El Super demurs to the First Cause of Action of the  FAC for wrongful death on the grounds that it fails to state a claim and is  uncertain. El Super contends the FAC pleads conclusory allegations and does not  plead facts that a dangerous condition on the property existed or how El Super  created that dangerous condition, such that it caused Defendant Oscar Gonzalez  to drive negligently. El Super contends Plaintiffs have pled zero facts to  support a causal connection between the negligent driving of Defendant Oscar  Gonzalez and any action on behalf of El Super. El Super further contends the  FAC is uncertain because it fails to provide El Super fair notice of what the  allegations are against El Super, as the FAC alleges no facts and is based on  conclusory allegations.   In opposition, Plaintiffs contend the FAC alleges  sufficient facts to state claims for wrongful death and survival, reciting  allegations from the FAC. Plaintiffs contend that El Super improperly asserts  facts not contained in the FAC. Plaintiffs also contend that the allegations  are clear and that the FAC is not uncertain, again reciting allegations from  the FAC.   The Court agrees with El Super that the FAC fails to  allege facts demonstrating that a dangerous and unsafe condition existed or  that El super created that condition, such that it caused Defendant Oscar  Gonzalez to drive negligently. (FAC, ¶¶ 18-19.) The FAC is otherwise devoid of  allegations demonstrating a causal connection between El Super’s actions and  Defendant Oscar Gonzalez’s driving. With respect to uncertainty, the Court does  not find there is a sufficient basis for demurrer, as the FAC is not so  ambiguous or unintelligible that El Super cannot reasonably respond. (A.J.  Fistes Corp. v. GDL Best Contractors, Inc. (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 677,  695.)   When a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be  allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman  v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to  show the court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.; Lewis v.  YouTube, LLC (2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) Plaintiffs did not proffer  any facts that could correct these pleading defects.  Accordingly, the Court SUSTAINS the demurrer to the  First Cause of Action in Plaintiffs’ FAC without leave to amend.  Second Cause of Action – Survival   Unlike a cause of action for wrongful death, a  survivor cause of action is not a new cause of action that vests in the heirs  on the death of the decedent. It is instead a separate and distinct cause of  action which belonged to the decedent before death but, by statute, survives  that event. (Grant v. McAuliffe, supra, 41 Cal.2d at p. 864, 264 P.2d  944.) The survival statutes do not create a cause of action. Rather, “[t]hey  merely prevent the abatement of the cause of action of the injured person, and  provide for its enforcement by or against the personal representative of the  deceased.” (Ibid.)   (Quiroz v. Seventh Ave. Ctr. (2006) 140  Cal.App.4th 1256, 1264.)                A cause of action that survives the death of a  person passes to the decedent's successor in interest and is enforceable by the  “decedent's personal representative or, if none, by the decedent's successor in  interest.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 377.30.) In the typical survivor action, the  damages recoverable by a personal representative or successor in interest on a  decedent's cause of action are limited by statute to “the loss or damage that  the decedent sustained or incurred before death, including any penalties or  punitive or exemplary damages that the decedent would have been entitled to  recover had the decedent lived, and¿do not¿include damages for pain,  suffering, or disfigurement,”¿unless the action was filed on or after  January 1, 2022, and before January 1, 2026.¿(Code Civ. Proc., §  377.34(a), (b), italics added.)¿   El Super demurs to the Second Cause of Action for  survival on the grounds that it fails to state a claim and is uncertain. The  parties’ arguments here are the same as those made above with respect to the  First Cause of Action for wrongful death.  Accordingly, the Court SUSTAINS the demurrer to the  Second Cause of Action for survival, without leave to amend, for the same  reasons set forth above.           CONCLUSION   The Court SUSTAINS the demurrer of Defendant  Chedraui USA, Inc., dba El Super to the First and Second Causes of Action of  Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint without leave to amend. The Court directs  Chedraui USA, Inc. dba El Super to submit a proposed order of dismissal for the  Court’s review and signature.   Chedraui USA, Inc. dba El Super is ordered to give  notice of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.
