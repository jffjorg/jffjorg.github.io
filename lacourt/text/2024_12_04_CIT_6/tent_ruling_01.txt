  Case Number:  22PSCV01744    Hearing Date:   December 4, 2024    Dept:  6 CASE  NAME:  Frances  Gundlach v. Frank Flores, et al.1.      Defendants’  Motion for Terminating Sanctions Against Plaintiff, Frances Gundlach, or  Alternatively, Additional Monetary Sanctions in the Amount of $811.65; and 2.      Defendant  Frank Flores’ Motion to Compel Compliance (CCP § 2031.320(a)) and for Monetary  Sanctions in the Amount of $811.65  TENTATIVE  RULING  The Court DENIES Defendants Frank Flores and Lydia Flores’ motion  for terminating sanctions, but GRANTS the alternative motion for monetary  sanctions in the amount of $811.65. Plaintiff and her attorney of record must  pay said monetary sanctions to counsel for Defendants within 20 days of the  Court’s order.  The Court DENIES Defendant Frank Flores’ motion to compel  compliance per Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.320, subdivision (a) and  for monetary sanctions.              Defendants Frank Flores and Lydia  Flores are ordered to give notice of the Court’s ruling within five calendar  days of this order.  BACKGROUND  This is a cat bite case. On November 9, 2022, plaintiff Frances  Gundlach (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants Frank Flores (Frank),  Lydia Flores and Does 1 through 100 (collectively, Defendants). On October 18,  2023, Plaintiffs filed the operative First Amended Complaint (FAC) against the  same Defendants, alleging causes of action for strict liability, negligence,  premises liability, and negligence per se. On January 3, 2024, the Court  sustained Defendants’ demurrer to the Fourth Cause of Action for negligence per  se with leave to amend. Plaintiff did not amend the FAC.  PROCEDURAL  BACKGROUND – Motion for Terminating Sanctions  On  September 19, 2024, the Court granted Defendant Frank Flores’ motion to compel  further responses to Form Interrogatories. Plaintiff was ordered to provide  further code-compliant responses, without objections, to Form Interrogatory  Numbers 2.1, 2.3, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.13, 3.6, 3.7, 6.2, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 8.1,  8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 10.2, 10.3, 11.2, 12.1, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5,  13.2, 14.1, 20.1, 20.3, and 20.4, within 20 days of the Court’s order.  Plaintiff and her attorney of record were also ordered to pay monetary  sanctions to counsel for Defendant Frank Flores in the amount of $811.65 within  20 days of the Court’s order as to such motion.  Also,  on September 19, 2024, the Court granted Defendant Frank Flores’ motion to  compel Plaintiff’s further responses to Special Interrogatories.  Plaintiff was ordered to provide further  code-compliant responses, without objections, to Special Interrogatory Numbers  2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25,  26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 44, 45, 46,  47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 59, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 81,  82, 84, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 99, and 100, within 20 days of the  Court’s order. Plaintiff and her attorney of record were also ordered to pay  monetary sanctions to counsel for Defendant Frank Flores in the sum of $811.65  as to such motion within 20 days of the Court’s order.    Defendant  Frank Flores filed and served a notice of ruling concerning the Court’s  September 19, 2024 order on September 20, 2024.  On  October 3, 2024, the Court denied Defendant Frank Flores’ motion for  issue/evidence sanctions and/or monetary sanctions in the amount of $811.65.  The Court found such motion to be procedurally defective.  On  October 25, 2024, Defendants filed the instant motion for terminating sanctions,  or alternatively, monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and her counsel of  record for Plaintiff’s failure to comply with the Court’s September 19, 2024  order.   On November  15, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition to the motion. On November 25, 2024, Defendants  replied.  LEGAL  STANDARD – Motion for Terminating Sanctions  The court is  authorized, after notice and an opportunity for hearing, to impose the  following sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the  discovery process: monetary sanctions, issue sanctions, evidence sanctions, terminating  sanctions, and contempt. (Code Civ. Proc., §¿2023.030, subds. (a)-(e).) A terminating  sanction may be imposed by an order dismissing the action of the party that  brought the action. (Id., § 2023.030, subd. (d)(3).)    “The  discovery statutes evince an incremental approach to discovery sanctions,  starting with monetary sanctions and ending with the ultimate sanction of  termination. [Citation.]” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc.¿(2009)  174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992 (Doppes); see J.W. v. Watchtower Bible and  Tract Society of New York, Inc.¿(2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 1142, 1169.) If a  lesser sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted. (Doppes, supra, 174  Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) “[C]ontinuing misuses of the discovery process warrant  incrementally harsher sanctions until the sanction is reached that will curb  the abuse.” (Id.) “Discovery sanctions ‘should be appropriate to the dereliction, and should not exceed what is required to protect the  interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.’ [Citation.]” (Id.)  “But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the  evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the  discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate  sanction.” (Id., quoting Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262,  279-280; Creed-21 v. City of Wildomar¿(2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702,  quoting Doppes and Mileikowsky.)    The court  should consider the totality of the circumstances, including conduct of the  party to determine if the actions were willful, the determent to the  propounding party, and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain  discovery. (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.)  Terminating sanctions should not be ordered lightly, but are justified where a  violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and there is evidence  that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery  rules. (Doppes, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at p. 992.)  “[A] sanction cannot go further than is necessary to accomplish the purpose of discovery.” (Newland v. Superior Court (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613.) “[S]anctions may not be imposed solely to punish the offending party.” (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1164, 1193.) “Furthermore, the sanction chosen should not provide a windfall for the other party, by putting the prevailing party in a better position than if he or she had obtained the discovery and it had been favorable.” (Ibid.) “If a plaintiff wishes to avail himself of the California courts, he owes a duty to comply with its rules, such as the rules of discovery.” (Cornwall v. Santa Monica Dairy Co. (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 250, 253.)  Before any  sanctions may be imposed the court must make an express finding that there has  been a willful failure of the party to serve the required discovery responses.  (Fairfield v. Superior Court for Los Angeles County (1966) 246  Cal.App.2d 113, 118.) The party who failed to comply with discovery obligations  has the burden of showing that the failure was not willful. (Deyo v.  Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 788; Cornwall v. Santa Monica Dairy  Co. (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 250, 252-253.)   Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010,  subdivisions (d) and (f), provide that a misuse of the discovery process  includes, but is not limited to, “[f]ailing to respond or to submit to an  authorized method of discovery” and “[m]aking an evasive response to discovery.” (Code  Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d), (f).)            DISCUSSION –  Motion for Terminating Sanctions              Meet and Confer              Defendants did not meet and confer in person, by  telephone, or by video conference before bringing this motion. (See Kraft  Decl., ¶ 5.) Although meeting and conferring is not required before bringing a  motion for terminating sanctions based on a failure to obey a court order, the  Court does request parties to meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by  video conference before bringing any motions. (5. [8:2145] Sanctions for  Failure to Obey Court Order:, Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial Ch. 8M-5;  Dept. 6 Courtroom Information [“Parties are required to meet and confer in  person, by telephone, or by video conference before filing any motion”].)              Summary of Arguments  Defendants seek terminating sanctions against Plaintiff to dismiss  this action with prejudice, or alternatively seek additional monetary  sanctions. Defendants contend Plaintiff willfully disobeyed the Court’s  September 19, 2024 order granting Defendants’ motions to compel further  responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Special Interrogatories, Set  One. Defendants contend Plaintiff attempted to serve unverified responses as  Word documents the day before the hearing on September 19, 2024. Defendants contend  that, as of the filing of the motion, Plaintiff did not provide verified  code-compliant responses.  As to monetary sanctions, Mr. Kraft  states that he has spent over two (2) hours related to the instant motion and  anticipates spending over an additional one (1) hour preparing a reply brief  and arguing the motion. (Kraft Decl., ¶ 7.) A $61.65 filing fee was incurred  for the motion. (Kraft Decl., ¶ 7.) Counsel’s hourly rate is $250.00 per hour  and the total time spent on this matter will be three (3) hours. (Kraft Decl.,  ¶ 7.) Defendants request monetary sanctions of $811.65 against Plaintiff and  her counsel of record. (Kraft Decl., ¶ 7.)  In opposition, Plaintiff indicates having served verified  responses on November 13, 2024.  In reply, Mr. Kraft presents Plaintiff’s purported  further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One and Special Interrogatories,  Set One, which were served on November 13, 2024. (Kraft Reply Decl., ¶¶ 3, 5;  Exs. B, D.)  Analysis  Terminating  Sanctions are Inappropriate at This Time  The Court notes that Plaintiff’s opposition tacitly  admits failing to comply with the Court’s September 19, 2024 order, as  Plaintiff indicates producing the responses on November 13, 2024, well after  the deadline to comply. (See generally, Opp.; Order re Tentative Ruling  (9/19/24).) Here, it is undisputed that Plaintiff did  not serve such further responses until November 13, 2024. Thus, Plaintiff did  not comply with this Court’s order. Additionally, upon reviewing Plaintiff’s  further responses, the Court notes that Plaintiff still has not provided  sufficient further responses. Plaintiff failed to provide an initial response  to FROG Nos. 8.7, 8.8, and 10.1. (Kraft Reply Decl., Ex. A.) Plaintiff also  failed to provide a further response to FROG Nos. 8.7, 8.8, and 10.2. (Kraft  Reply Decl., Ex. B.) Plaintiff’s further responses to the special  interrogatories are also deficient. For instance, Plaintiff failed to provide a  further response to SROG Nos. 8, 22, and 23. (Kraft Reply Decl., Exs. C, D.) As  an additional example of Plaintiff’s non-compliance with this Court’s order,  Plaintiff failed to provide any response to SROG No. 20 in either her initial  or further responses. (Kraft Reply Decl., Exs. C, D.) Thus, the Court finds  that Plaintiff’s belated further responses to the form and special  interrogatories are deficient.  However, the Court finds that imposition  of terminating sanctions would amount to punishment and would provide a  windfall to Defendants. The Court must take an incremental approach to  sanctions. Notwithstanding Plaintiff’s unexplained  dilatory conduct, the Court finds terminating sanctions would be excessive at  this point in time, given Plaintiff’s eventual production of the responses  sought. (Sauer v. Superior Ct. (1987) 195 Cal.App.3d 213, 228  [imposition of sanctions lies within the court’s discretion].) The Court  nevertheless admonishes Plaintiff and her counsel of record to comply with  discovery obligations, and warns that any further misconduct in this regard may  result in greater sanctions. (Lopez v. Watchtower Bible &  Tract Soc'y of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566, 604  [discovery statutes evince an incremental approach to sanctions].)  The Court therefore DENIES Defendants’  request for terminating sanctions. The Court, however, ORDERS Plaintiff to  comply with this Court’s September 19, 2024 order forthwith and in any event no  later than 20 days from the Court’s order.  Monetary  Sanctions Should be Imposed  The Court finds that Defendants are  entitled to monetary sanctions. Based on the foregoing, the  Court GRANTS the alternative request for monetary sanctions in the amount of  $811.65, comprised of 3.0 hours preparing the motion and appearing at the  hearing on the motion, multiplied by the hourly rate of $250.00, plus the  $61.65 filing fee. Plaintiff and her attorney of record must pay said monetary  sanctions to counsel for Defendants within 20 days of the Court’s order.   PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND – Motion to Compel Compliance              On  October 25, 2024, Defendant Frank moved to compel compliance under Code of  Civil Procedure section 2031.320, subdivision (a). The motion is unopposed.  LEGAL STANDARD – Motion to Compel Compliance             “If a party filing a response to a demand for  inspection, copying, testing, or sampling under Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,  2031.240, and 2031.280 thereafter fails to permit the inspection, copying, testing, or sampling in  accordance with that party's statement of compliance, the demanding party may move for an order compelling  compliance.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.320, subd. (a).)  DISCUSSION – Motion to Compel Compliance              Meet and  Confer  Defendant Frank did not meet and confer in person, by telephone,  or by video conference before bringing this motion. (See Kraft Decl., ¶ 5.)  Although meeting and conferring is not required before bringing a motion to  compel compliance under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.320, subdivision  (a), the Court does request parties to meet and confer in person, by telephone,  or by video conference before bringing any motions. (Code Civ. Proc., §  2031.320, subd. (a); Dept. 6 Courtroom Information [“Parties are required to  meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference before filing  any motion”].)  Summary of Arguments  Defendant  Frank seeks to compel compliance with Plaintiff’s statement of compliance  provided in response to Frank’s document production request served on November  21, 2023, and to which the Court ordered Plaintiff to provide responsive  documents on April 29, 2024. Frank contends that in late May, Plaintiff  produced the following documents in response to 47 categories of documents: a  two-page letter/statement from Naura Kassis; 11 pages of medical records; and  three pictures. (Kraft Decl., ¶ 7; Ex. D.) No other documents were produced.  (Kraft Decl., ¶ 7.) Plaintiff contends that there is no reasonable way the  documents Plaintiff produced constitute the complete universe of documents  reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence in this  matter.  Analysis  The Court  finds that the instant motion is made on improper grounds. The motion is made  pursuant to CCP § 2031.320, which concerns a party’s failure to comply with a  statement of compliance. Here, there is no evidence before the Court that  Plaintiff provided a statement of compliance.  However, even  if the Court were to consider this as a motion to compel further responses to  the Request for Production of Documents. The Court finds Defendant Frank’s  motion unavailing. Frank’s arguments that more documents must exist because of  the number of categories of documents requested is speculative. While it seems plausible  that more documents would exist than the amount produced, that does not  necessarily mean they do exist. If they did, the Court would need more evidence  from Frank that they do exist. For example, if the documents produced evidenced  the existence of other relevant documents then there would be a proper basis for  compelling further responses, but Frank has not demonstrated that that is the  case.  For the  foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES the motion to compel compliance.  CONCLUSION The Court DENIES Defendants Frank Flores and Lydia Flores’ motion  for terminating sanctions, but GRANTS the alternative motion for monetary  sanctions in the amount of $811.65. Plaintiff and her attorney of record must  pay said monetary sanctions to counsel for Defendants within 20 days of the  Court’s order.  The Court DENIES Defendant Frank Flores’ motion to compel  compliance per Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.320, subdivision (a) and  for monetary sanctions.              Defendants Frank Flores and Lydia  Flores are ordered to give notice of the Court’s ruling within five calendar  days of this order.
