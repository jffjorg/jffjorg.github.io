And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the Motion for Terminating Sanctions filed by Defendant/Cross-Complainant Ha-Rakhamon Farhod Azizi against Plaintiff Ramish Manglani. The Motion was filed in response to Plaintiff Manglani's failure to provide initial responses to form interrogatories and special interrogatories as ordered by the Court.

The Court has discretion to impose terminating sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030. However, the Court finds that less severe sanctions would produce compliance with the discovery rules. The Court notes that Plaintiff Manglani's counsel, John F. Bazan, has filed a Declaration in Opposition and has acknowledged his mistake regarding the case. The Court believes that Counsel Bazan will engage in the case and encourage Plaintiff Manglani to comply with the discovery rules.

The Court declines to award terminating sanctions and instead declines to award monetary sanctions. The Court finds that Defendant/Cross-Complainant's request for attorney's fees is unreasonably inflated and is not justified. The Motion is DENIED.
