And here is the English-text summary:

The Court denied the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay action pending arbitration. The arbitration agreement is both procedurally unconscionable and substantively unconscionable. The agreement is a classic take-it-or-leave-it contract of adhesion, and the defendant did not give the plaintiff a meaningful choice or opportunity to negotiate the document. The agreement also has multiple provisions that are substantively unconscionable, including limitations on discovery, a requirement for arbitration to occur in San Francisco County, and provisions that are not signed by the company. The Court found that the agreement is one-sided and favors the defendant, and that the parties intended to create a binding agreement that limits the plaintiff's rights and remedies.
