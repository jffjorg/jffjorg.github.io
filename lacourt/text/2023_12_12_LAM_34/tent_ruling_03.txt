ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal Standard
 
“A written agreement to submit to arbitration an
existing controversy or a controversy thereafter arising is valid, enforceable
and irrevocable, save upon such grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.)
 
“On petition of a party to an arbitration agreement
alleging the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a controversy and
that a party to the agreement refuses to arbitrate that controversy, the court
shall order the petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate the controversy if
it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists [unless it
makes certain determinations].” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2.)
 
“Under both federal and state law, arbitration
agreements are valid and enforceable, unless they are revocable for reasons
under state law that would render any contract revocable. . . . Reasons that would render any
contract revocable under state law include fraud, duress, and
unconscionability.” (Tiri v. Lucky Chances, Inc. (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th
231, 239, citations omitted.)
 
“The party seeking to compel arbitration bears the
burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence the existence of an
arbitration agreement.¿The party opposing the petition bears the burden of
establishing a defense to the agreement's enforcement by a preponderance of the
evidence.¿In determining whether there is a duty to arbitrate, the trial court
must, at least to some extent, examine and construe the agreement.” (Tiri,
supra, at p. 239.)
 
II.       Discussion
 
A.      The
Arbitration Agreement
 
Defendant submits a document titled “At-Will
Employment, Confidential Information, Invention Assignment, and Arbitration
Agreement” (“Arbitration Agreement”). (Decl. Boullon, Exh. B, p. 1.) The
Arbitration Agreement is purportedly signed by Plaintiff on July 20, 2020. (Id.
at p. 14.)
 
        The following are the relevant portions
of the Arbitration Agreement.
 
As
a condition of my employment with Sensei Holdings, Inc (the “Company”), and in
consideration of my employment with the Company and my receipt of the
compensation now and hereafter paid to me by the Company, I agree to the
following provisions of this At-Will Employment, Confidential Information,
Invention Assignment, and Arbitration Agreement (this “Agreement”): 
        . . . 
 
11. Arbitration and Equitable Relief 
 
A.
Arbitration. IN CONSIDERATION OF MY EMPLOYMENT WITH THE COMPANY, ITS PROMISE TO
ARBITRATE ALL EMPLOYMENT-RELATED DISPUTES WITH ME, AND MY RECEIPT OF
COMPENSATION AND OTHER COMPANY BENEFITS, AT PRESENT AND IN THE FUTURE, I AGREE
THAT ANY AND ALL CONTROVERSIES, CLAIMS, OR DISPUTES THAT I MAY HAVE WITH THE
COMPANY (INCLUDING ANY COMPANY EMPLOYEE, OFFICER, DIRECTOR, TRUSTEE, OR BENEFIT
PLAN OF THE COMPANY, IN THEIR CAPACITY AS SUCH OR OTHERWISE), ARISING OUT OF,
RELATING TO, OR RESULTING FROM MY EMPLOYMENT OR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMPANY
OR THE TERMINATION OF MY EMPLOYMENT OR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMPANY, INCLUDING
ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT, SHALL BE SUBJECT TO BINDING ARBITRATION PURSUANT
TO THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT (9 U.S.C. SEC. 1 ET SEQ.) (THE “FAA”). THE FAA’S
SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL PROVISIONS SHALL EXCLUSIVELY GOVERN AND APPLY WITH
FULL FORCE AND EFFECT TO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ITS ENFORCEMENT,
AND ANY STATE COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION SHALL COMPEL ARBITRATION IN THE
SAME MANNER AS A FEDERAL COURT UNDER THE FAA. I FURTHER AGREE THAT, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, I MAY BRING ANY ARBITRATION PROCEEDING ONLY IN
MY INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS MEMBER
IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE LAWSUIT OR PROCEEDING. I
UNDERSTAND, HOWEVER, THAT NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT PREVENTS ME FROM BRINGING A
REPRESENTATIVE LAWSUIT OR PROCEEDING AS PERMITTED BY THE CALIFORNIA LABOR
CODE’S PRIVATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL ACT OF 2004. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY LAW, I AGREE TO ARBITRATE ANY AND ALL COMMON LAW AND/OR STATUTORY
CLAIMS UNDER LOCAL, STATE, OR FEDERAL LAW, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
CLAIMS UNDER TITLE VII OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1964, THE AMERICANS WITH
DISABILITIES ACT OF 1990, THE AGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT ACT OF 1967, THE
OLDER WORKERS BENEFIT PROTECTION ACT, THE WORKER ADJUSTMENT AND RETRAINING
NOTIFICATION ACT, THE FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT, THE CALIFORNIA FAIR EMPLOYMENT
AND HOUSING ACT, THE FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT, THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY RIGHTS
ACT, THE CALIFORNIA LABOR CODE, CLAIMS RELATING TO EMPLOYMENT STATUS, CLAIMS
RELATING TO COMPENSATION (CASH, EQUITY, BONUS, OR OTHERWISE), CLAIMS RELATING
TO CLASSIFICATION, AND CLAIMS OF HARASSMENT, DISCRIMINATION, WRONGFUL
TERMINATION, AND BREACH OF CONTRACT. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, I
ALSO AGREE TO ARBITRATE ANY AND ALL DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE
INTERPRETATION OR APPLICATION OF THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, BUT NOT DISPUTES
ABOUT THE ENFORCEABILITY, REVOCABILITY, OR VALIDITY OF THIS AGREEMENT TO
ARBITRATE OR THE CLASS, COLLECTIVE, AND REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING WAIVER
HEREIN. WITH RESPECT TO ALL SUCH CLAIMS AND DISPUTES THAT I AGREE TO ARBITRATE,
I HEREBY EXPRESSLY AGREE TO WAIVE, AND DO WAIVE, ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY.
I FURTHER UNDERSTAND THAT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE ALSO APPLIES TO ANY
DISPUTES THAT THE COMPANY MAY HAVE WITH ME. I UNDERSTAND THAT NOTHING IN THIS
AGREEMENT REQUIRES ME TO ARBITRATE CLAIMS THAT CANNOT BE ARBITRATED UNDER THE
SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OR OTHER LAW THAT EXPRESSLY PROHIBITS ARBITRATION OF A CLAIM
NOTWITHSTANDING THE APPLICATION OF THE FAA. 
 
B.
Administration of Arbitration. I AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION WILL BE
ADMINISTERED BY JAMS PURSUANT TO ITS EMPLOYMENT ARBITRATION RULES &
PROCEDURES (THE “JAMS RULES”), WHICH ARE AVAILABLE AT http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-employment-arbitration/.
IF THE JAMS RULES CANNOT BE ENFORCED AS TO THE ARBITRATION, THEN THE PARTIES
AGREE THAT THEY WILL ARBITRATE THIS DISPUTE UTILIZING JAMS COMPREHENSIVE
ARBITRATION RULES AND PROCEDURES OR SUCH RULES AS THE ARBITRATOR MAY DEEM MOST
APPROPRIATE FOR THE DISPUTE. I AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE THE POWER
TO DECIDE ANY MOTIONS BROUGHT BY ANY PARTY TO THE ARBITRATION, INCLUDING
MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND/OR ADJUDICATION, AND MOTIONS TO DISMISS AND
DEMURRERS, APPLYING THE STANDARDS SET FORTH FOR SUCH MOTIONS UNDER THE
CALIFORNIA CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE. I AGREE that the arbitrator shall issue a
written decision on the merits. I ALSO AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE THE
POWER TO AWARD ANY REMEDIES AVAILABLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, AND THAT THE
ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COSTS TO THE PREVAILING PARTY, WHERE
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. I agree that the decree or award rendered by the
arbitrator may be entered as a final and binding judgment in any court having
jurisdiction thereof. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE COMPANY WILL PAY FOR ANY
ADMINISTRATIVE OR HEARING FEES CHARGED BY THE ARBITRATOR OR JAMS EXCEPT THAT I
SHALL PAY ANY FILING FEES ASSOCIATED WITH ANY ARBITRATION THAT I INITIATE, BUT
ONLY SO MUCH OF THE FILING FEES AS I WOULD HAVE INSTEAD PAID HAD I FILED A
COMPLAINT IN A COURT OF LAW THAT WOULD HAVE HAD JURISDICTION OVER SUCH
COMPLAINT. SUBJECT TO THE FAA’S EXCLUSIVE APPLICABILITY TO THE ENFORCEMENT OF
THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, I AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR SHALL ADMINISTER AND
CONDUCT ANY ARBITRATION HEARING OR PROCEEDING APPLYING CALIFORNIA SUBSTANTIVE
AND DECISIONAL LAW AND THE CALIFORNIA CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE, INCLUDING THE
CALIFORNIA CIVIL DISCOVERY ACT. I agree that any arbitration under this
Agreement shall be conducted in SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY, California. 
 
C.
Remedy. FOR PURPOSES OF SEEKING PROVISIONAL REMEDIES ONLY, I AGREE THAT
THE COMPANY AND I SHALL BE ENTITLED TO PURSUE ANY PROVISIONAL REMEDY PERMITTED
BY THE CALIFORNIA ARBITRATION ACT (CALIFORNIA CODE CIV. PROC. § 1281.8), OR
OTHERWISE PROVIDED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EXCEPT FOR SUCH PROVISIONAL RELIEF, I
AGREE THAT ANY RELIEF OTHERWISE AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY OR ME UNDER APPLICABLE
LAW SHALL BE PURSUED SOLELY AND EXCLUSIVELY IN ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO THE
TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. 
 
D.
Administrative Relief. I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT
PROHIBIT ME FROM PURSUING AN ADMINISTRATIVE CLAIM WITH A LOCAL, STATE, OR
FEDERAL ADMINISTRATIVE BODY OR GOVERNMENT AGENCY THAT IS AUTHORIZED TO ENFORCE
OR ADMINISTER LAWS RELATED TO EMPLOYMENT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING, THE EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY
COMMISSION, THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD, THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION, OR THE WORKERS’ COMPENSATION BOARD. THIS AGREEMENT DOES, HOWEVER,
PRECLUDE ME FROM PURSUING A COURT ACTION REGARDING ANY SUCH CLAIM, EXCEPT AS
PERMITTED BY LAW. 
 
E.
Voluntary Nature of Agreement. I ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT I AM
EXECUTING THIS AGREEMENT VOLUNTARILY AND WITHOUT ANY DURESS OR UNDUE INFLUENCE
BY THE COMPANY OR ANYONE ELSE. I FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT I HAVE
CAREFULLY READ THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT I HAVE ASKED ANY QUESTIONS NEEDED FOR ME
TO UNDERSTAND THE TERMS, CONSEQUENCES, AND BINDING EFFECT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND
FULLY UNDERSTAND IT, INCLUDING THAT I AM WAIVING MY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.
I AGREE THAT I HAVE BEEN PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK THE ADVICE OF AN
ATTORNEY OF MY CHOICE BEFORE SIGNING THIS AGREEMENT. 
 
(Decl.
Boullon, Exh. B, emphases in original.)
 
B.      The Parties’ Arguments
 
Defendant moves the Court to enforce the Arbitration
Agreement and stay this action pending completion of arbitration. (Motion, p.
15:17–20.)
 
Plaintiff opposes the Motion, arguing that the
Arbitration Agreement is both procedurally and substantively unconscionable.
(Opposition, pp. 4:18, 4:23, 6:17.)
 
In its Reply, Defendant argues that the Arbitration
is neither procedurally nor substantively unconscionable, but that the Court
should sever any unconscionable terms. (Reply, pp. 6:10, 8:25, 14:24.) 
 
C.      Whether
an Arbitration Agreement Exists
 
The Arbitration Agreement
appears to be signed by Plaintiff on July 20, 2020. (Decl. Boullon, Exh. B, p.
14.) Plaintiff does not dispute that he signed the Arbitration Agreement.
(Decl. Johnston, ¶ 3.)
 
        Plaintiff does not argue in his opposition
that there is no arbitration agreement. 
The Court finds that Defendant has met its burden to show that an
arbitration agreement exists. 
 
D.     Unconscionability
 
1.      Legal
Standard
 
“Agreements to arbitrate may be
invalidated if they are found to be unconscionable.” (Fitz v. NCR Corp.
(2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 702, 713, citations omitted.)
 
“Unconscionability consists of
both procedural and substantive elements. The procedural element addresses the
circumstances of contract negotiation and formation, focusing on oppression or
surprise due to unequal bargaining power. Substantive unconscionability
pertains to the fairness of an agreement's actual terms and to assessments of
whether they are overly harsh or one-sided. (Pinnacle Museum Tower Ass’n v.
Pinnacle Mkt. Dev. (US), LLC (2012) 55 Cal.4th 223, 246, citations
omitted.)
 
“‘The prevailing view is that [procedural and
substantive unconscionability] must both be present in order for a court
to exercise its discretion to refuse to enforce a contract or clause under the
doctrine of unconscionability.’ But
they need not be present in the same degree. ‘Essentially a sliding scale is
invoked which disregards the regularity of the procedural process of the
contract formation, that creates the terms, in proportion to the greater
harshness or unreasonableness of the substantive terms themselves.’ In other words, the more substantively oppressive the contract term, the less evidence of
procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the
term is unenforceable, and vice versa. (Armendariz
v. Found. Health Psychcare Servs., Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 83, 114, [cleaned
up], italics in original, abrogated in part on other grounds by AT&T
Mobility LLC v. Concepcion (2010) 565 U.S. 333.).)
 
“The party resisting arbitration bears the burden of proving
unconscionability.” (Pinnacle, supra, 55 Cal.4th at p.
247, citation omitted.)
 
“Moreover, courts are required to determine the unconscionability of
the contract ‘at the time it was made.’” (Sanchez v. Valencia Holding Co.,
LLC (2015) 61 Cal.4th 899, 920, quoting Civ. Code, § 1670.5.) 
 
“Unconscionability is ultimately a question of law.” (Patterson v.
ITT Consumer Fin. Corp. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 1659, 1663, citation
omitted.)
 
2.      Procedural Unconscionability
 
a.  
    Legal Standard
 
“[P]rocedural unconscionability requires
oppression or surprise. Oppression occurs where a contract involves lack of
negotiation and meaningful choice, surprise where the allegedly unconscionable
provision is hidden within a prolix printed form.” (Pinnacle, supra,
55 Cal.4th at p. 247 [cleaned up].)
 
“The procedural element of an
unconscionable contract generally takes the form of a contract of adhesion . .
. .” (Little v. Auto Stiegler, Inc. (2003) 29 Cal.4th 1064, 1071.)
 
b.  
    Discussion
 
Plaintiff argues that the Arbitration Agreement is procedurally
unconscionable. Defendant disagrees. 
 
Plaintiff is correct.
 
“Absent unusual circumstances, a contract offered on a
take-it-or-leave-it is deemed adhesive, and a commercial transaction conditioned
on a party’s acceptance of such a contract is deemed procedurally
unconscionable.” (Vasquez v. Greene Motors, Inc. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th
1172, 1184.)
 
        “[F]ew employees are in a position to
refuse a job because of an arbitration agreement.” (Armendariz, supra,
24 Cal.4th at p. 115.) 
 
        The Arbitration Agreement is a classic
take-it-or-leave-it contract of adhesion. Defendant did not give Plaintiff a
meaningful choice or opportunity to negotiate the document. (Decl. Johnston, ¶
3.)
 
        The Court finds that the Arbitration
Agreement is procedurally unconscionable. 

 
3.      Substantive Unconscionability
 
a.  
    Legal Standard
 
“Substantive unconscionability
focuses on overly harsh or one-sided results. In assessing substantive unconscionability, the paramount
consideration is mutuality.” (Fitz, supra, 118 Cal.App.4th at p.
723 [cleaned up].)
 
b.  
    Discussion
 
Plaintiff argues that the Arbitration Agreement is substantively
unconscionable, pointing to: (1) multiple instances of non-mutuality; (2) the
requirement for arbitrating in San Francisco County; (3) the lack of sufficient
discovery; and (4) a provision against “taking away employees,” which Plaintiff
claims is illegal. (Opposition, pp. 6:20, 6:24, 7:14, 9:1–2, 9:18, 11:19,
12:8–9, 14:3, 14:19.) Plaintiff further argues that the unconscionable
provisions are not severable. (Id. at p. 15:1.)
 
Defendant disagrees, arguing: (1) that the Parties have an equal
obligation to arbitrate; (2) that the Invention Assignment Agreement remedies provision
do not evidence unconscionability; (3) that the forum selection clause is not
unconscionable and is easily severable; (4) that the Arbitration Agreement
provides for adequate discovery; and (5) that the other terms identified by
Plaintiff are not unconscionable or unlawful. (Reply, pp. 9:5, 10:21, 12:18,
13:4, 13:24.) Defendant argues that the Court should severe any unconscionable
terms. (Id. at p. 14:24.)
 
The Court agrees with Plaintiff. 
 
The provisions of the Arbitration Agreement lack mutuality.  The Agreement which was signed by Plaintiff binds
him but not the company.  For instance, the
agreement states:
 
·      
“As a condition of my employment . . ., I
agree to the following provisions . . . .”
·      
“IN CONSIDERATION OF MY EMPLOYMENT WITH
THE COMPANY . . . I AGREE THAT ANY AND ALL CONTROVERSIES, CLAIMS,
OR DISPUTES THAT I MAY HAVE WITH THE COMPANY . . . SHALL BE SUBJECT TO BINDING
ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT (9 U.S.C. SEC. 1 ET SEQ.)”
·      
“I FURTHER AGREE THAT, TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, I MAY BRING ANY ARBITRATION PROCEEDING . .
. .”
·      
“TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
LAW, I AGREE TO ARBITRATE ANY AND ALL COMMON LAW AND/OR STATUTORY
CLAIMS . . . . TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, I ALSO AGREE TO
ARBITRATE ANY AND ALL DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE
INTERPRETATION OR APPLICATION OF THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE . . . .”
·      
“I FURTHER UNDERSTAND THAT THIS
AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE ALSO APPLIES TO ANY DISPUTES THAT THE COMPANY MAY HAVE
WITH ME.”
·      
“I AGREE THAT ANY
ARBITRATION WILL BE ADMINISTERED BY JAMS . . . .”
·      
“I agree that any
arbitration under this Agreement shall be conducted in SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY,
California.”
·      
“I ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT I AM
EXECUTING THIS AGREEMENT VOLUNTARILY AND WITHOUT ANY DURESS OR UNDUE
INFLUENCE BY THE COMPANY OR ANYONE ELSE. I FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE
THAT I HAVE CAREFULLY READ THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT I HAVE ASKED ANY QUESTIONS
NEEDED FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND THE TERMS, CONSEQUENCES, AND BINDING EFFECT OF THIS
AGREEMENT AND FULLY UNDERSTAND IT, INCLUDING THAT I AM WAIVING MY
RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. I AGREE THAT I HAVE BEEN PROVIDED AN
OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK THE ADVICE OF AN ATTORNEY OF MY CHOICE BEFORE SIGNING THIS
AGREEMENT.”
 
Although not raised by Plaintiff, the Court notes that the arbitration
agreement is not signed by the company. 
 
Any appearance of mutuality evaporates under closer
inspection.  For instance, the agreement
states that Plaintiff “understand[s] that this agreement to arbitrate also
applies to any disputes that the company may have with me.”  (Boullon Decl., Exh. B.)  This is simply a statement of Plaintiff’s
understanding; it is not a commitment by the company to arbitrate.  Even the first sentence of the agreement is
illusory in its mutuality.  The agreement
states that the company “promise[s] to arbitrate all employment-related
disputes” with Plaintiff.  But the
agreement is not signed by the company. (Boullon Decl., Exh. B.)  Further, even if it were found that the
company had agreed to arbitrate all employment-related disputes, the company
has nowhere agreed to the details of such arbitration:  e.g., that the arbitration be administered by
JAMS or that it take place in San Francisco.
 
The Court is aware that some courts have held that the company need
not sign the arbitration agreement for it to be enforceable.  “A party who has signed a contract may be compelled
specifically to perform it, though the other party has not signed it, if the
latter has performed, or offers to perform it on his part, and the case is
otherwise proper for enforcing specific performance.” (Civ. Code, § 3388; see Serafin
v. Balco Props. Ltd., LLC (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 165, 177  [holding that Civil Code section 3388 applies
in the context of arbitration agreements].) 
But taking that route would add another layer of unconscionability.  It would allow Defendant to enforce the arbitration
agreement if it wished, but at the same time would allow Defendant to sue Plaintiff
in Court if it so desired.  That is
simply not fair.
 
There is no mutuality, where only Plaintiff but not Defendant is
bound by the arbitration agreement. 
 
        On the sole basis of this complete lack
of mutuality, the Court can find that this Arbitration Agreement is
substantively unconscionable. 
 
However, other provisions of the agreement are also
substantively unconscionable.  The
agreement incorporates JAMS rules, which limit each side to one deposition,
unless the arbitrator decides, in their own discretion, to allow more.  This is unconscionable.  
 
“While superficially neutral, the discovery restrictions
favor defendants. Employment disputes are factually complex, and their outcomes are
often determined by the testimony of multiple percipient witnesses, as well as
written information about the disputed employment practice. Seemingly neutral
limitations on discovery in employment disputes may be nonmutual in effect.
This is because the employer already has in its possession many of the
documents relevant to an employment case as well as having in its employ many
of the relevant witnesses.” (De Leon v. Pinnacle Prop. Mgmt. Servs., LLC (2021)
72 Cal.App.5th 476, 487–488 [cleaned up].)
 
This Court recognizes that some decisions have upheld arbitration provisions
that limit the right of discovery to one deposition, with further depositions
allowable by a showing of need. (See, for example, Dotson v. Amgen, Inc. (2010)
181 Cal.App.4th 975, 982–985.) This is because the Court must “assume that the
arbitrator will operate in a reasonable manner in conformity with the law.” (Ibid.)
 However, other Courts of Appeal have
noted that such a provision can add to the substantive unconscionability of an
arbitration agreement. (See, for example, Martinez v. Master Protection
Corp. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 107, 118–119 [“Nevertheless, considered
against the backdrop of the other indisputably unconscionable provisions, the
limitations on discovery do, in our view, compound the one-sidedness of the
arbitration agreement.”].) 
 
Further, the requirement that arbitration occur in San Francisco
County – although Plaintiff worked for Defendant in Los Angeles County –
further adds to the substantive unconscionability of the Arbitration
Agreement.  
 
“Where
an ‘arbitration agreement contains more than one unlawful provision,’ that
factor weighs against severance.” (Penilla v. Westmont Corp. (2016) 3
Cal.App.5th 205, 222, quoting Armendariz, supra, 24 Cal.4th at
pp. 124–125.) “[U]pholding this type of agreement
with multiple unconscionable terms would create an incentive for an employer to
draft a one-sided arbitration agreement in the hope employees would not
challenge the unlawful provisions, but if they do, the court would simply modify the agreement to include the
bilateral terms the employer should have included in the first place.” (Mills
v. Facility Sols. Grp., Inc. (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 1035, 1045.)
 
The Court finds that substantive unconscionability permeates
the document. Choosing to sever multiple clauses would encourage the drafters
of arbitration agreements to include as many unconscionable clauses as many
unconscionable clauses as possible, knowing courts might catch some but not all
of them. 
 
        The Arbitration Agreement is both
procedurally unconscionable and substantively unconscionable. The arbitration
agreement is procedurally unconscionable because it was a take-it-or-leave-it
contract of adhesions.  The arbitration
agreement is substantively unconscionable containing multiple substantively
unconscionable provisions.
 
III.     Conclusion
 
The Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay Action Pending
Arbitration is DENIED.
