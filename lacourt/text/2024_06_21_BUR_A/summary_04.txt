And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is in response to a motion brought by Claimant David Minkin to compel Respondent United Financial Casualty Company to provide a privilege log and further responses to RFPD Nos. 16 & 17. The motion was opposed by Respondent, who claimed that the requests were overly broad and would impose a significant burden to produce.

The Court finds that Claimant has shown good cause for further production as the contents of Respondent's claim and investigation files are indispensable in the prosecution of Claimant's case. The Court also finds that Respondent's objections to production are insufficient and that Respondent has not shown that the requests are overly burdensome.

The Court grants Claimant's motion to compel further responses to RFPD Nos. 16 & 17 subject to the limitation that Respondent may exclude any written communication, including but not limited to email and written correspondence which originates from an attorney or is addressed to an attorney. The Court also grants Claimant's motion to compel Respondent to provide a privilege log.

The Court denies Claimant's request for sanctions as Respondent's opposition to the motion was not entirely without merit.
