ANALYSIS: 
 
Leaf Capital Funding,
LLC (Plaintiff) brings this action against Capital
Ready Mix, Inc. and Tigran Aneian (Defendants) for
breach of contract.  Plaintiff alleges
that Defendants are in arrears on an agreement to lease a Caterpillar Model
988K HRC Wheel Loader. 
 
On May 2,
2024, the Court heard Plaintiff’s ex parte Application for Issuance of Writ of
Attachment. Plaintiff primarily sought to attach the potential proceeds of a
settlement Defendant had reached with his insurer in federal court.  Plaintiff also sought to attach a variety of
other property and funds in which Defendant purportedly has an interest,
however these requests were not briefed in the application. As such, the Court
granted the ex parte application as to the insurance proceeds only. The Court
then continued the ex parte hearing to May 16, 2024 to allow Defendants to brief
their homestead exemption arguments. 
 
On May
16, 2024, the Court again heard the ex parte application. Based on the moving
and opposition papers, the Court maintained that the application be partially
granted as to the potential insurance proceeds. The Court also found that
Defendants had adequately demonstrated the proceeds were subject to a homestead
exemption, given that the insurance action stemmed from the loss of Aneian’s
home in a fire. As such, the Court granted the homestead exemption in the
amount of $699,426.00. 
 
The Court
then set a hearing date for an Application for Issuance of Writ of Attachment
for June 21, 2024. This date was meant to provide the parties with the
opportunity to brief the other items which Plaintiff sought to attach in its
original application. The parties were to file their opposition and reply
pursuant to code. 
 
A review
of the Court’s record shows that neither party has filed any briefing relevant
to this application subsequent to the May 16 hearing. As such, the Court is
without the information to determine whether the remaining items requested are
appropriately subject to attachment, as the original briefs only addressed the
insurance proceeds. 
 
Given
that neither party has filed further briefing on the matter, the Court wil order
the hearing on this application off calendar. The Court upholds its previous ruling
granting the ex parte application and approving Defendant’s homestead exemption.
