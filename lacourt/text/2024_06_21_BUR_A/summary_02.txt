  - "The Court finds the Complaint pleads sufficient facts as to concealment."
  - "The Court notes this issue was also addressed by Dhital. The Dhital plaintiffs alleged claims under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act and a common law fraud claim alleging that Nissan fraudulently concealed the defects and induced them to purchase a car."

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted Ford Motor Company's motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the fifth cause of action for Fraudulent Inducement-Concealment. The Judge found that the Plaintiff has not pled sufficient facts to establish the elements of his claim and has failed to allege a transactional relationship to establish a duty to disclose. The Judge also found that the Plaintiff's claim is not barred by the economic loss rule, as the California Supreme Court's decision in Robinson Helicopter Co., Inc. v. Dana Corp. does not explicitly exempt fraudulent inducement claims based on concealment. The Judge granted the motion with 30 days' leave to amend.
