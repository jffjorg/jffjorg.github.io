Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses two motions to quash deposition subpoenas filed by Emma Amosh Mirzaian and Edwin Baltazar (Moving Defendants) in response to subpoenas issued by The City of La Cañada Flintridge (Respondent) for their medical records. The court finds that the original subpoenas were withdrawn by Respondent and new subpoenas were issued on May 21, 2024. Since the original subpoenas were withdrawn, the court finds the motions to quash are MOOT. The court encourages the parties to engage in meet and confer before filing subsequent motions to quash. The court also notes that when an individual's right of privacy conflicts with the need for discovery in litigation, the court must balance the competing interests and permit only what is necessary for a fair resolution of the lawsuit.
