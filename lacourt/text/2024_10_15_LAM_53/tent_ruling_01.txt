Order
  RE:
 
(1)  
  motion
  for summary judgment
(2)  
  motion
  to be relieved as counsel
 



The court’s case management system reflects that there are two matters
set for hearing on October 15, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department 53 in this
action: (1) a motion for summary judgment, and (2) a motion to be relieved as
counsel.  However, no party has filed
papers in connection with either motion. 

The court therefore orders that the October 15, 2024 hearing on the
motion for summary judgment and motion to be relieved as counsel is vacated. 
The court orders plaintiffs to give notice of this order.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  October 15, 2024
