[tentative]
  Order RE:
 
defendants’ motion for judgment on the
  pleadings
 



 
MOVING PARTIES:              Defendants California Landmark
Group, Inc., R3 Lofts LLC, and CLG Management LLC     
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       n/a
Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings
Defendants California Landmark Group, Inc., R3 Lofts LLC, and CLG
Management LLC (“Defendants”) filed the pending motion for judgment on the
pleadings on May 15, 2024, directed to the Complaint filed by plaintiff Martin
Ramirez (“Plaintiff”).  Thereafter, on June
20, 2024, Plaintiff filed his operative First Amended Complaint against, inter
alia, Defendants.  
Thus, the court finds that Defendants’ motion for judgment on the
pleadings, directed to the superseded Complaint, is moot.  (Hardell v. Vanzyl (2024) 102
Cal.App.5th 960, 968 [“‘Because there is but one complaint in a civil action
[citation], the filing of an amended complaint moots a motion directed to a
prior complaint’”] [internal citation omitted].) 
The court therefore orders that defendants California Landmark Group,
Inc., R3 Lofts LLC, and CLG Management LLC’s motion for judgment on the
pleadings is taken off calendar as moot. 
            The court orders defendants
California Landmark Group, Inc., R3 Lofts LLC, and CLG Management LLC to give
notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
