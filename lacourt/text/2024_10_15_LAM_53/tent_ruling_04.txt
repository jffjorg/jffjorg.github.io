DISCUSSION
David Euredjian of Foster,
Sultanyan & Euredjian (“Plaintiffs’ Counsel”) separately moves to be
relieved as counsel for (1) plaintiff Martina Negrete Arreola, and (2)
plaintiff Luis E. Garcia (collectively, “Plaintiffs”).  In the interest of efficiency, the court
discusses Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s two motions together. 
“The question of granting or
denying an application of an attorney to withdraw as counsel (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 284, subd. 2) is one which lies within the sound discretion of the trial
court ‘having in mind whether such withdrawal might work an injustice in the
handling of the case.’”¿ (People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398,
406 [internal quotations omitted].)¿ The court should also consider whether the
attorney’s “withdrawal can be accomplished without undue prejudice to the
client’s interests.”¿ (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904,
915.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
For a motion to be relieved as
counsel under Code of Civil Procedure section 284, subdivision (2), California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 requires (1) a notice of motion and motion directed
to the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel -- Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general terms and
without compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship
why a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 284, subdivision (2) is
brought instead of filing a consent under Code of Civil Procedure section 284,
subdivision (1) (made on the Declaration in Support of Attorney’s Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel -- Civil form (MC-052)); (3) service of the notice of
motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order on the client and on all
other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order
relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel -- Civil form (MC-053)).¿¿¿ 
The court finds that
Plaintiffs’ Counsel has served Plaintiffs (1) with the moving papers filed in
connection with each motion by mail at Plaintiffs’ last known addresses, which
Plaintiffs’ Counsel has been unable to confirm are current or to locate a more
current address for each plaintiff after making reasonable efforts to do so,
and by email, and (2) with notice of the continued hearing dates on the pending
motions, by mail and email.  (MC-051
Forms, Proofs of Service; MC-052 Forms, ¶ 3, subds. (a)(2), (b)(2)(b),
(b)(2)(e); Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1362, subd. (d)(1)(B); Sep. 13, 2024
Notice Regarding Hearing Dates, pp. 1:22, 2.) 
The court also finds that Plaintiffs’ Counsel has shown sufficient
reasons why the motions should be granted, and why counsel has brought the
motions under Code of Civil Procedure section 284, subdivision (2) instead of
filing consents under section 284, subdivision (1).¿ (MC-052 Forms, ¶¿2.)¿
The court therefore grants
Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s (1) motion to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff
Martina Negrete Arreola, and (2) motion to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff
Luis E. Garcia. 
David Euredjian of Foster,
Sultanyan & Euredjian will be relieved as counsel of record for plaintiffs
Martina Negrete Arreola and Luis E. Garcia effective upon the filing of the
proofs of service of the signed “Order[s] Granting Attorney’s Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel – Civil” on each of the clients.
The court orders David
Euredjian of Foster, Sultanyan & Euredjian to give notice of this ruling
and the signed “Order[s] Granting Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel –
Civil” to plaintiffs Martina Negrete Arreola and Luis E. Garcia.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
