  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion to seal
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Forex Express Corp.,
d/b/a WireCash          
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant Eliran Grushkowsky
Motion to Seal 
Plaintiff Forex Express Corp.,
d/b/a WireCash (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order filing under seal (1)
portions of the memorandum of points and authorities filed on September 26,
2024 in connection with Plaintiff’s motion for the appointment of a discovery
referee, and  (2) exhibits 21, 32, and
33, as attached to the declaration of Scott Ferrier, filed in support of
Plaintiff’s motion for the appointment of a discovery referee.  (Not. of Mot., p. 2:10-14.) 
Similarly, the court notes
that, on October 4, 2024, defendant and cross-complainant Inter & Co
Payments, Inc., and defendant Inter & Co. (the “Inter Defendants”) filed a
motion for an order filing under seal (1) pages 11:22-24, 12:17-19, 17:13-15,
and 19:14-17 of Plaintiff’s motion for the appointment of a discovery referee,
(2) exhibits 25, 43, 44, and 45, as attached to the declaration of Scott
Ferrier, filed in in support of Plaintiff’s motion for the appointment of a
discovery referee, and (3) portions of exhibits 20-23, 32-33, and 38, as
attached to the declaration of Scott Ferrier, filed in in support of
Plaintiff’s motion for the appointment of a discovery referee.  (Inter Def. Notice of Mot., p. 2:11-15.)  Inter Defendants’ motion to seal is scheduled
for hearing on October 29, 2024. 
Because Plaintiff and Inter
Defendants have each filed motions to seal portions of the papers filed in
connection with Plaintiff’s motion for the appointment of a discovery referee,
the court finds that it would is in furtherance of judicial efficiency and
economy to hear the two motions to seal together.  The court therefore exercises its discretion
to continue the hearing on Plaintiff’s motion to seal to be heard on the same
date as Inter Defendants’ motion to seal. 
ORDER
            The court orders that the hearing on
plaintiff Forex Express Corp., d/b/a WireCash’s motion to seal is continued to
October 29, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., in Department 53.
            The court orders plaintiff Forex
Express Corp., d/b/a WireCash to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
