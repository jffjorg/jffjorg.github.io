And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a motion to set aside a default and default judgment in a case brought by Plaintiffs Shelbie Sanders, Shaina Sanders Shepard, Ronald Eugene Scott, and Regina Louise Hill against Defendants Deep Green Housing and Community Development, Inc. and Central Village Apartments, L.P.

The judge finds that the motion to set aside the default is untimely, as it was filed more than six months after the entry of default. However, the judge grants the motion to set aside the default judgment, as the Defendants have provided evidence that the default judgment was obtained due to a mistake by Imonti, the Executive Director of Deep Green Housing and Community Development, Inc.

The judge rules that the default judgment was obtained due to Imonti's mistake, as he believed that Atlantic Casualty was handling the defense of the case, but received no correspondence regarding the case until he received a copy of the abstract of judgment in May 2024. The judge also notes that David Sheinin, the insurance broker, corroborated Imonti's statements and that Atlantic Casualty had declined coverage of the matter.

The judge orders that the default judgment be set aside and that the Defendants remain in default. The judge also notes that the Defendants may bring a motion to vacate the default and default judgment on grounds other than Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b).
