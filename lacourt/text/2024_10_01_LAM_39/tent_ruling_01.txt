MOTIONS
            Plaintiff
Madeleine Kristin Varela (“Plaintiff”) settled her claims against Defendants
Ford Motor Company and Autonation Ford Valencia (“Defendants”).  Plaintiff seeks attorney fees and costs in the
amount of $29,958.10.  Defendants oppose
the motion.
ANALYSIS
The prevailing
party must seek an award of attorney fees through a noticed motion and bears
the burden of proof to justify the amount sought.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd.
(c)(5)(A).)  
In the instant
case, Plaintiff contends her attorneys billed $22,525 in attorney fees.  This lodestar figure is based on billing the
hourly rate of $425 per hour.  “The
reasonable market value of the attorney's services is the measure of a
reasonable hourly rate.  This standard
applies regardless of whether the attorneys claiming fees charge nothing for
their services, charge at below-market or discounted rates, represent the
client on a straight contingent fee basis, or are in-house counsel.”  (Chacon v. Litke (2010) 181
Cal.App.4th 1234, 1260, internal quotations and citations omitted.)  Based on the Court’s experience in reviewing
requests for attorney fees in similar litigation and the evidence before the
Court, the Court concludes $425 per hour is a reasonable rate for attorneys
engaged in similar litigation in the Los Angeles area.  (See Stratton v. Beck (2017) 9
Cal.App.5th 483, 496.)  
As Defendants
point out, and Plaintiff counsel’s billing entries reflect, counsel billed 11
hours in this case (from October 20 to the first seven entries on December 4,
2023) before he began drafting the complaint in this matter.  Until Plaintiff executed the retainer
agreement, Plaintiff was not counsel’s client. 
Certainly, some of that 11 hours could be attributed to office overhead
expenses, which are not recoverable as attorney fees.  Despite counsel’s remarks concerning his
extensive experience in the area of law at the heart of this matter, the Court
will award Plaintiff 5.5 hours for her counsel’s work in gearing up for the case up to the
filing of the complaint, or $2,337.50.
Defendants advance
evidence that, on January 16, 2024, Defendants offered to repurchase the
vehicle and pay Plaintiff $9,500 in attorney fees.  Plaintiff accepted the repurchase offer, but indicated
Plaintiff would file a fee motion.  (See
Declaration of Matthew M. Proudfoot, ¶¶ 8,9, Exhibits E, F.)  From the time Plaintiff retained counsel to
January 16, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel billed $10,795.  It was not reasonable for counsel to incur an
additional $7,055 in attorney fees after the parties resolved the substance of Plaintiff’s
claim. The Court finds the amount of these additional fees are not reasonable
and decreases them by one half, or $3,527.50.  Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff’s
motion for attorney fees an awards her $16,660 ($2,337.50 plus $10,795.00 plus
$3,527.50).  
The Court declines
to award a positive multiplier.  The
Court finds that the hourly rate of Plaintiff’s attorney reflects the
complexity of the case, which was not novel, and did not preclude other
employment.  
Plaintiff also
seeks costs in the amount of $675.60.  If
Plaintiff seeks an award of costs, Plaintiff must do so by filing a memorandum
of costs.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1700(a).)  
Plaintiff is ordered to provide notice of this order and to
file proof of service of same.
