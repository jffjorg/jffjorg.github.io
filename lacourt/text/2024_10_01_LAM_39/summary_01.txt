Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The plaintiff is seeking $29,958.10 in attorney fees and costs, but the judge has awarded her $16,660. The judge found that the hourly rate of $425 per hour claimed by the plaintiff's counsel is reasonable, but reduced the amount of fees incurred after January 16, 2024, by half. The judge also declined to award a positive multiplier, citing the complexity of the case and the fact that the attorney's hourly rate reflects that complexity. Additionally, the judge ordered the plaintiff to provide notice of the order and to file proof of service of same.
