  - "This case (at the demurrer stage) presents a dispute between two parties, one of whom claims that she was contractually bound by a written contract to pay money for services rendered (ironically Plaintiff) and one of whom claims that it performed thousands of dollars of services all the while unsure of who was going to be financially responsible for paying the bill (ironically Defendants)"
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge will not address the issue of whether the 4AC is a "sham pleading" and will instead focus on the merits of the case. The plaintiff concedes that the case concerns a contract dispute, and the judge is unsure what the plaintiff means by a sentence in their opposition. The defendants argue that WHSC was permitted to share the plaintiff's information with WHH, but the judge does not need to decide this issue. The judge will allow the plaintiff's claim regarding WHSC's alleged sharing of information with the plaintiff's insurer to proceed. The judge also notes that partial demurrers are improper and will not be considered.
