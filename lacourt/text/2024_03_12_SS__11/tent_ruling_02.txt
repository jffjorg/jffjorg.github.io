The Court’s granting of judicial notice is independent of whether the 4AC is a
sham pleading.  The Court declines to
address the “sham pleading” issue.

Notably, Plaintiff concedes that the CMIA claim concerns a contract
dispute.  (See Opposition, p. 13
[asserting that “this case (at the demurrer stage) presents a dispute between
two parties, one of whom claims that she was contractually bound by a written
contract to pay money for services rendered (ironically Plaintiff) and one of
whom claims that it performed thousands of dollars of services all the while
unsure of who was going to be financially responsible for paying the bill
(ironically Defendants)”].)

Plaintiff also argues that the Informed Consent “contemplates ‘prior approval,’
proceedings which is inapplicable given the allegations of Plaintiff’s
Complaint and the unlawful disclosures made post-surgery and post-completion
services.”  (Ibid.)  The sentence contains a typo and is
unclear.  The Court is not sure what Plaintiff
means by it.
 


[4]
Defendants assert that WHSC was permitted to share Plaintiff’s information with
WHH.  (See Demurrer, p. 10.)  The Court does not need to decide this
argument.  It is enough that Plaintiff
states a claim regarding WHSC’s alleged sharing of information with Plaintiff’s
insurer.  Partial demurrers are
improper.
