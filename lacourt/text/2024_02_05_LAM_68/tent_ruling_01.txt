SUMMARY OF ACTION
On February 11, 2020, Plaintiffs 828 Media et al. and
defendants David Brown, et al. entered into an agreement for the financing and
production of a “film” entitled “Fallout.” The terms required an investment
loan of $1,500,000 from 828 Media, with a promised return on $1,800,000 under
the terms. The parties also executed a separate “side letter,” whereby the 828
Media and Clear Distribution, LLC agreed to an equal distribution of “any and
all sales” following distribution. “throughout the world.” 
 
Following investment of $285,000, the project shut down
due to Covid restrictions. New terms were agreed upon whereby 828 Media would
only invest $365,000. Meanwhile, production continued with the knowledge of 828
Media and its principal, plaintiff Lundbohm, with a follow-up offer to return
the $285,000 loan proceeds, due to new investors joining the project.
Plaintiffs maintains the resumption of production without notice, along with
other  actions by Defendants, violated
the terms of the contract. 
 
On October 9, 2020, Plaintiffs filed a complaint for
Breach of Contract, Breach of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, Breach of Fiduciary
Duty, Aiding and Abetting, and Promissory Fraud. A 170.6 challenge to the
assigned officer led to a transfer of the action to Department 68.
 
On January 11, 2021, the case was ordered to arbitration.
On May 30, 2023, the court lifted the stay on the matter. 
 
RULING: Granted.

Distribution, LLC moves to be relieved as counsel of record, due to a breakdown
of the attorney client relationship. Counsel maintains the firm in fact
withdrew in 2021, but remains identified as counsel of record.
