RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
MOVING
ATTORNEY: James McDonald
CLIENT:
 Defendant, Steven Barbarich
 
RELIEF REQUESTED
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel
of Record
 
SUMMARY OF ACTION
Plaintiff Marilyn Paredes alleges an independent
contractor and subsequent employment relationship with Majestic Ventures, LLC
dba Vacation Homes 365 and/or Steven Barbarich beginning in April
2020. Plaintiff worked as a manager for the enterprise, which rented a
portfolio of at least 18 “vacation homes,” including coordination of all
operational aspects. Plaintiff expended personal funds for items such as cleaning
crews and security services, as required, with the intention of obtaining
reimbursement. Upon further inquiry, Plaintiff was instead terminated on April
14, 2022.
 
On June 13, 2022, Plaintiff filed a complaint for Breach
of Contract, Violation of Labor Code section 1102.5, Wrongful Termination in
Violation of Public Policy, Failure to Pay Timely Earned Wages, Violation of
Labor Code section 2802, and Violation of Labor Code section 226.8. On November
14, 2022, Defendants answered and filed a cross-complaint for Tortious
Interference with Contract, Tortious Interference with Prospective Business
Advantage, and Defamation. Defendants/Cross-Complainants contend following
termination, Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant began to contact known clients for the
delivery of disparaging information/accusations regarding company operations. A
special motion to strike the cross-complaint was denied on January 12, 2023.
 
RULING: Granted.
Counsel for defendant “Steven
Barbarich, individually and as Manager of Majestic Ventures, LLC dba Vacation
Homes 365,” moves to be relieved as counsel of record, due to unspecified
“irreconcilable differences.” Counsel maintains the firm in fact withdrew in
2021, but remains identified as counsel of record.
 
“The determination whether to grant or deny a motion to
withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi
& Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.) The court
accepts the necessity of client confidentiality, and will meet counsel in
chambers, if requested. (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 6068, subd. (e); Manfredi
& Levine v. Superior Court, supra, 66 Cal.App.4th at p. 1133; Aceves
v. Superior Court (1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 584, 590- 593.) The motion
otherwise complies with all procedural requirements. The motion is therefore
granted. 
 
Order not effective until service on the client. It remains unclear
whether a corporate entity exists or if the title constitutes a fictitious
business name. The court therefore notes that the corporate entity cannot
appear in the action without representation from an admitted attorney, if
applicable. (Merco Constr. Engineers,
Inc. v. Municipal Court (1978) 21 Cal.3d 724, 731.)
 
Trial remains set for April 29, 2024.
