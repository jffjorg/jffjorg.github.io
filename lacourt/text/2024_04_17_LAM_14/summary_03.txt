And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to continue the trial to an unspecified date. The final status conference is continued to October 16, 2024, at 10:00 am. All counsel and any unrepresented parties are required to be present in person at the final status conference. The discovery deadlines will be calculated based on the new date. The court notes that the trial date was previously set for April 29, 2024, but the case was significantly interrupted midstream by its trip to arbitration and back. The defense does not dispute that much of the discovery common to cases such as this has not been done. The court finds that it is in the interests of both parties to continue the case to allow for further discovery and to avoid the risk of going to trial with a half-prepared case.
