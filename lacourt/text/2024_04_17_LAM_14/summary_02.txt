Here is the English text summary of the tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling addresses two motions: a motion for sanctions and a demurrer. The motion for sanctions was filed by the defendants, seeking to strike the plaintiff's complaint and award sanctions against the plaintiff and her counsel. The judge rules that the motion for sanctions is denied because the plaintiff withdrew the original complaint before the end of the safe harbor period. The judge also rules that the demurrer is taken off-calendar and the case is stayed pending the outcome of a related case. The judge sets a status conference for June 14, 2024.
