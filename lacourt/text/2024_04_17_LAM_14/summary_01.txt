And here is the English text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion by the plaintiff to file a cross-complaint against a new party. The plaintiff alleges that it performed construction work for which it was not paid, while the defendant alleges that the plaintiff failed to do the work agreed upon. The court grants the motion, allowing the plaintiff to file the cross-complaint by April 24, 2024. The court also orders that the cross-complaint will be tried separately from the original complaint, with the original complaint to be tried first, as currently scheduled. The discovery deadlines for the new cross-complaint will be pegged to the date later chosen for trial of those claims. The court's decision is based on the principle that the law prefers the filing of cross-complaints in construction cases over the filing of new actions, and that the court has the power to mitigate prejudice by exercising its discretion to sever the pleadings.
