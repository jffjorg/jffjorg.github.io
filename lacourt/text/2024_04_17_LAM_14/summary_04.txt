And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Mitchell v. Covenant Living Communities and Services. The Plaintiff, a blind individual, alleges that the Defendant's website design is not compatible with his screen-reading software, leaving him unable to use the site. The Defendant has demurred to the complaint, arguing that the Plaintiff has no standing to sue, that the case is moot, and that the Plaintiff has failed to plead a violation of the Unruh Act. The Judge has denied the Defendant's demurrer, finding that the Plaintiff has pled standing and causation, and that the case is not moot. The Judge has granted the Plaintiff's request for judicial notice as to Exhibit 1. The case will proceed to trial.
