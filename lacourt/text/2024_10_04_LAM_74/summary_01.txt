And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Almost Nothing, Inc. v. Omid Reyhanian et al. The defendants, Omid Reyhanian, Peyman Balakhane, and Peyman Balakhaneh, had filed a demurrer and motion to strike certain claims made by the plaintiff. The judge has overruled the demurrers to the claims of conspiracy to defraud and negligence, finding that the allegations are sufficient to withstand demurrer. However, the judge has sustained the cause of action for conversion, finding that it only applies to personal property and not to intangible property like debt. The judge has also denied the motion to strike the request for punitive damages (because the plaintiff has stated a cause of action for fraud) and attorney's fees (because the lease allows for their recovery). The defendants are required to file their answer within 20 days and provide notice to the plaintiff.
