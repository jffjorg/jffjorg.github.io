 Case Number:  23STCV17330    Hearing Date:   October 4, 2024    Dept:  74 Defendant MERCEDES-BENZ USA, LLC’s
Motion to Compel Arbitration
 
Seeking
to compel arbitration of this Song-Beverly case, defendant manufacturer Mercedes-Benz
contends equitable estoppel and third-party beneficiary principles apply to the
retail installment sales contract by which plaintiff bought her car from car dealership
Sonic Santa Monica. Mercedes-Benz does not present evidence of a relationship
between itself and the car dealership demonstrating the motivating purpose of
the contract was for Mercedes-Benz’s benefit.  Based on Ford Motor Warranty Cases
(2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324 rev. granted S279969 (July 19, 2023); Kielar v.
Superior Court of Placer County (2023) 94 Cal.App.5th 614 rev. granted
S281937 (Oct. 25, 2023); Montemayor v. Ford Motor Co. (2023) 92 Cal.App.5th
958 rev. granted S281237 (Sept. 20, 2023); Yeh v. Superior Court of Contra
Costa Ctny. (2023) 95 Cal.App.5th 264 rev. granted S282228 (Nov. 15, 2023);
and Davis v. Nissan North America Inc (2024) 100 Cal.App.5th 825 rev.
granted S284697 (May 29, 2024) – all of which the court deems better reasoned
than Felisilda v. FCA US LLC (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 486 and Sanchez v.
Valencia Holding Co. (2015) 61 Cal.4th 899 – the court finds Mercedes-Benz’s
third-party beneficiary and equitable estoppel contentions unavailing. (Auto
Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court of Santa Clara County (1962) 57 Cal.2d
450, 455.)
            The
court denies the motion to compel arbitration.
            Defendant
shall give notice.
