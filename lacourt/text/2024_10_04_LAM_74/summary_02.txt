And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC's motion to compel arbitration of a case involving a retail installment sales contract between the plaintiff and Sonic Santa Monica. The judge has denied the motion, finding that Mercedes-Benz's claims of equitable estoppel and third-party beneficiary principles do not apply to the contract. The judge has relied on several recent court decisions, including Ford Motor Warranty Cases and Kielar v. Superior Court of Placer County, to support its decision. The judge has also noted that Mercedes-Benz has not presented evidence of a relationship between itself and the car dealership demonstrating the motivating purpose of the contract was for Mercedes-Benz's benefit. As a result, the judge has denied the motion to compel arbitration and ordered the defendant to give notice.
