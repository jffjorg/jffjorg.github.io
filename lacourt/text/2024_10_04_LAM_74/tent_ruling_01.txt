  Case Number:  22STCV17079    Hearing Date:   October 4, 2024    Dept:  74 Almost  Nothing, Inc. v. Omid Reyhanian et al. Defendants Omid Revhanian, Peyman  Balakhane and Pejamn Balakhaneh’s Demurrer and Motion to Strike.   The court overrules the demurrers to  the causes of action alleging conspiracy to defraud and negligence because the  allegations are sufficient to withstand demurrer. The court sustains without  leave to amend the cause of action for conversion because conversion applies to  personal property, but a debt is intangible property not subject to conversion.  The court denies the motion to strike the request for punitive damages (because  plaintiff states a cause of action for fraud) and attorney’s fees (because the  lease allows for their recovery.)   Defendants shall file their answer within  20 days.   Defendants shall give  notice.
