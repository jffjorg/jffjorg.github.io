And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion to strike punitive damages allegations brought by defendants Ronnie Hongo and Raymond Hongo. The plaintiffs, Sean Jennings and Candace Hirahara, have alleged five causes of action against the defendants, including breach of contract, breach of warranty of habitability, breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, negligence, and tenant harassment.

The defendants argue that the claim for punitive damages is insufficiently alleged and/or not properly permitted on the cause of action. However, the court finds that the plaintiffs have adequately stated a claim for punitive damages, citing similar facts in Stoiber v. Honeychuck (1980) and Smith v. David (1981).

However, the court strikes paragraph 34 requesting punitive damages for the breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, as punitive damages are not available for this claim. The court grants the motion to strike in part, but denies it in all other respects.
