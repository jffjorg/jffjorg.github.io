And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment without prejudice. The Plaintiff sought a default judgment against the Defendants in the amount of $165,993.83, including damages, recovery fees, interest, attorney fees, and costs. However, the Judge found several issues with the default judgment package. These issues include the Plaintiff's failure to pray for recovery fees in the complaint, conflicting evidence regarding the sale of the tractor, duplicate entries on the Plaintiff's counsel's billing record, an overstated costs calculation, an overstated prejudgment interest calculation, and the lack of submission of the original agreement or a declaration explaining why a copy was submitted instead. The Judge has ordered the Plaintiff to correct these issues before the request for entry of default judgment can be reconsidered.
