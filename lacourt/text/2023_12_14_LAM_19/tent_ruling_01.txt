Counsel for Plaintiff to give notice.   STATEMENT OF  FACTS This action arises out of alleged breach of contract.  Plaintiff Global Equity Finance, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) brings suit against  Defendants Dustin Rosenberg, Convoy Home Loans, Inc. (“Convoy”), and Jonathon  Yoo (collectively, “Defendants”) alleging the following causes of action in the  Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”): 1.     Breach of Contract [against Defendant  Rosenberg]; 2.     Breach of Contract [against Defendant  Yoo]; 3.     Conversion [against all Defendants]; 4.     Breach of the Duty of Loyalty [against  Defendants Rosenberg and Yoo]; 5.     Intentional Interference with  Prospective Economic Advantage [against all Defendants]; 6.     Violation of Penal Code § 502 [against  all Defendants]; 7.     Violation of Business and Professions  Code § 17200, et seq. [against all Defendants]; and 8.     Negligent Interference with  Prospective Business Advantage [against all Defendants].   Defendant Yoo filed a Cross-Complaint against Plaintiff  alleging the following causes of action: 1.     Declaratory Relief;   V   Violation of Business and Professions  Code § 17200; and 3.     Breach of Contract.   Defendant Convoy filed a First Amended Cross-Complaint  against Plaintiff alleging the following causes of action: 1.     Intentional Interference with  Contractual Relationship; 2.     Intentional Interference with  Prospective Business Advantage; 3.     Violation Of Business &  Professions Code § 17200, Et Seq.; 4.     Defamation Per Se; and 5.     Trade Libel.   Defendant Rosenberg filed a First Amended Cross-Complaint  against Plaintiff and Cross-Defendant Morgan Hough alleging the following  causes of action: 1.     Declaratory Relief; 2.     Violation of Business and Professions  Code § 17200; 3.     Breach of Contract; and 4.     Defamation.   On October 30, 2023, Plaintiff filed its “Ex Parte  Application To Seal Records Lodged Conditionally Under Seal In Support Of  Motion For Summary Judgment, Or In The Alternative, Summary Adjudication On All  Cross- Complaints” (the “Ex Parte”). On October 31, 2023, the Court granted the Ex Parte in  part, setting the Hearing on Motion to Seal Records Lodged Conditionally Under  Seal In Support Of Motion For Summary Judgment, Or In The Alternative, Summary  Adjudication On All Cross-Complaints with the Ex Parte (hereafter, the  “Motion”) deemed the opening brief. On November 21, 2023, the Court  continued the hearing and ordered Plaintiff to file a brief supplemental  memorandum of points and authorities and supplemental declaration that  addressed issues identified by the Court. (See November 21, 2023 Minute Order,  pp. 1-2.) On December 1, 2023, Plaintiff  filed a Supplemental Memorandum of Points and Authorities (“Supp. Brief”) that  includes a declaration of Jasmina E. Aragon. Plaintiff also filed an “Errata  Re: Index Of Exhibits In Support Of Motion For Summary Judgment, Or In The  Alternative, Summary Adjudication” (the “Errata”) indicating that Exhibit E  refers to document bates-stamped CONVOY02565, not CONVOY02654 as indicated in  the Index of Exhibits filed with the motion for summary judgment papers.   GROUNDS FOR  MOTION   Pursuant to California Rules of  Court, rules 2.550 and 2.551, Plaintiff moves for an order sealing: 9.      Document bates-stamped CONVOY00004 through  CONVOY00024; 10.   Documents bates-stamped CONVOY02565/Exhibit E  (see Errata); 11.   The following from Exhibit G  (Defendant/Cross-Complainant’s July 18, 2023 Deposition): pp. 24:13-33:12;  89:19-90:25; 91:8-12; 12.   Document bates-stamped CONVOY02714 through  CONVOY02716; 13.   Document bates-stamped CONVOY03688; 14.   Document bates-stamped CONVOY01796 through  CONVOY01817; 15.   Document bates-stamped CONVOY1854 through CONVOY1871;  and 16.   Document bates-stamped CONVOY06113 through CONVOY06115. DISCUSSION A.     Legal Standards “Substantive courtroom  proceedings in ordinary civil cases, and the transcripts and records pertaining  to these proceedings, are presumptively open.” (McNair v. National Collegiate Athletic Association (2015) 234  Cal.App.4th 25, 31; see Cal. R. Ct., 2.500(c) [“Unless confidentiality is  required by law, court records are presumed to be open.”].) However, “[o]penness  is a presumption; it is not an absolute.” (Id.) In order for the presumption  of openness to be overcome, the trial court must hold a hearing and make  findings compatible with the constitutional standards set forth by the  California Supreme Court in NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc. v. Superior Court  (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178. (Id.) The procedure for filing records  under seal that are not required to be kept confidential under law is governed  by California Rules of Court, rules 2.550 and 2.551. (Cal. R. Ct, 2.550(a).) “A  party requesting that a record be filed under seal must file a motion or an  application for an order sealing the record.” (Cal. R. Ct., 2.551(b)(1).) “The  motion or application must be accompanied by a memorandum and a declaration  containing facts sufficient to justify the sealing.” (Id.) Further, “[a] request to seal a  document must be filed publicly and separately from the object of the request.  It must be supported by a factual declaration or affidavit explaining the  particular needs of the case.” (In re  Marriage of Lechowick (1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 1406, 1416.)  The constitutional standards set  forth in NBC Subsidiary,  supra, are codified  in California Rules of Court rules 2.550, subdivision (d) which provides that: The  court may order that a record be filed under seal only if it expressly finds  facts that establish: (1)  There exists an overriding interest that  overcomes the right of public access to the record; (2)  The overriding interest supports sealing the  record; (3)  A substantial probability exists that the  overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed; (4)  The proposed sealing is narrowly tailored;  and (5)  No less restrictive means exist to achieve  the overriding interest. (Cal.  R. Ct., 2.550(d); accord, NBC Subsidiary, supra, 20  Cal.4th at 1215-1219; see McNair, supra, 234  Cal.App.4th at 32-35  [“[NBC Subsidiary’s]  constitutionally required findings are embodied in the California Rules of  Court…. Documents may be sealed under the Rules of Court only upon a proper  showing of NBC Subsidiary's four  factors.”].) Pursuant  to California Rules of Court, rule 2.550, subdivision (e)(1): An  order sealing the record must: (A) Specifically state the facts that support  the findings; and (B) Direct the sealing of only those documents and pages, or,  if reasonably practicable, portions of those documents and pages, that contain  the material that needs to be placed under seal. All other portions of each  document or page must be included in the public file. (Cal.  R. Ct., 2.550(e)(1).) The  mere agreement of the parties to seal documents filed in a public courtroom is  insufficient to constitute an overriding interest to justify sealing the  documents. (Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Superior Court (2003) 110  Cal.App.4th 1273, 1281–1282; see Cal. R. Ct., 2.551(a) [“The court must not  permit a record to be filed under seal based solely on the agreement or  stipulation of the parties.”].) Rather, there must be “a specific showing of  serious injury.” (Id. at 1282.) Indeed, “specificity is essential.” (Id.  (internal quotations and citation omitted.) “Broad allegations of harm, bereft  of specific examples or articulated reasoning, are insufficient.” (Ibid.)  "[A]t a minimum… the party seeking to seal documents, or maintain them  under seal, must come forward with a specific enumeration of the facts sought  to be withheld and specific reasons for withholding them.” (H.B. Fuller Co.  v. Doe (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 879, 894.) B.     Analysis The Court finds that Plaintiff establishes an overriding  interest in protecting in sealing the records, namely, to protect “proprietary  information, information related to business operations, and non-party private information”  including confidential financial information and sensitive private information  of non-parties. (Jasmina E. Aragon Decl. at ¶ 11; see Charlotte G. Carne Decl.,  ¶¶ 5-7.) The Court finds that Plaintiff’s interest will be prejudiced  if the records are not sealed and made publicly available, and that the  proposed sealing is narrowly tailored. (Ibid.) The Court finds that there is no  less restrictive means to achieve this overriding interest. (See Aragon Decl.  at ¶ 12.) Accordingly, the Motion is GRANTED.
