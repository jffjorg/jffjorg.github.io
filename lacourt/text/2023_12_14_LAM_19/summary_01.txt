  - "The court may order that a record be filed under seal only if it expressly finds facts that establish: (1) There exists an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record; (2) The overriding interest supports sealing the record; (3) A substantial probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed; (4) The proposed sealing is narrowly tailored; and (5) No less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to seal certain records in support of their motion for summary judgment or alternative summary adjudication on all cross-complaints. The sealed records include various documents and pages from Exhibit G, as well as other confidential financial information and sensitive private information of non-parties. The judge found that the plaintiff established an overriding interest in protecting this information, and that the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored and justified. The judge also noted that the mere agreement of the parties to seal documents is insufficient to constitute an overriding interest, and that a specific showing of serious injury is required.
