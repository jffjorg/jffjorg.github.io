And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendant, Razmik Abkarians, in response to the complaint filed by the plaintiff, Blaine Ikeda. The demurrer was filed on January 18, 2024, and the plaintiff filed their opposition on March 4, 2024. The defendant demurred to the first two causes of action in the complaint, alleging fraud and conversion.

The judge has ruled that the demurrer is OVERRULED as to the first cause of action for fraud. The court finds that the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to support a claim of fraud, including that the defendant concealed the diversion of funds and that the plaintiff relied on the defendant's affirmative obligation to disclose the diversion.

The judge has also ruled that the demurrer is OVERRULED as to the second cause of action for conversion. The court finds that the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to support a claim of conversion, including that the defendant diverted funds from the corporate entity and that the plaintiff owned a 50% interest in the entity. The court also finds that the plaintiff has identified a specific sum of money that was diverted, which is necessary to support a claim of conversion.

The judge's ruling is tentative and subject to change based on further briefing or oral argument.
