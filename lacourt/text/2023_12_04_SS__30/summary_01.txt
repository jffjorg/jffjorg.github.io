And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff to undergo a mental examination with Dr. Dupee on December 11, 2023. The plaintiff is entitled to have an audio recording of the examination, but his mother or any third-party observer is not allowed to be present during the examination. The judge has also granted the defendant's motion to continue the trial date to February 6, 2024. The judge has based this decision on the fact that the plaintiff has placed his mental condition at issue and has undergone psychological evaluation and treatment. The judge has also considered the defendant's argument that the plaintiff's experts have unlimited access to the plaintiff and can evaluate him as many times as they want, whereas the defendant's expert has not had the opportunity to examine the plaintiff independently. The judge has ruled that the defendant's expert needs to have the opportunity to examine the plaintiff independently to evaluate the nature and extent of the plaintiff's claimed injuries.
