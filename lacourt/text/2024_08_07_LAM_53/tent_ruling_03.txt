  Order RE:
 
petition for approval of compromise of claim
  for minor claimant grecia ruby bedolla
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Petitioner Maria Lorena
Concepción  Holguin Puentes 
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim for Minor Claimant Grecia
Ruby Bedolla
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this petition.  No opposition papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Petitioner Maria Lorena Concepción
Holguin Puentes (“Petitioner”) seeks court approval of the settlement made on
behalf of minor claimant Grecia Ruby Bedolla (“Minor Claimant”) in this action.
The
compromise of a minor’s disputed claim for damages is valid only after it has
been approved, upon the filing of a petition, by the court.¿ (Prob. Code, §
3500.)¿ The petition must be verified by the petitioner, must contain a full
disclosure of all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of
the compromise, and must be prepared on Judicial Council form MC-350.¿ (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)¿ 
Defendants
Mar Vista Fund, LLC, Mar Vista Entitlement Fund, LLC, Manuel Cara Edralin, Jr.,
individually and as trustee of the Edralin Manuel C 2005 Trust, J&S
Properties Enterprises, Inc., and Beach City Capital Management, LLC have
agreed to pay a total of $2,000,000 to settle this action, of which $51,438.07
will be separately allocated to Minor Claimant. 
(MC-350, ¶¶ 10, 11, subd. (b), Attachment 11b(5).)  Of the $51,438.07 allocated to Minor Claimant,
$12,859.52 will be paid to counsel for attorney’s fees and $1,002.18 will be
paid to counsel for litigation costs. 
(MC-350, ¶¶ 13, 16.)  The
remaining $37,576.37 will be invested in a single-premium deferred annuity,
subject to withdrawal only on authorization of the court.  (MC-350, ¶¶ 16, 18, subd. (b)(3).) 
The court has reviewed the petition and finds the settlement to be
fair and reasonable, and in the best interest of Minor Claimant.  The court further finds that the declaration
of David Campbell Smith is sufficient to support the request for attorney’s
fees in the amount of $12,859.53, representing 25 percent of the $51,438.07 settlement.  (Smith Decl., ¶¶ 3, 9.)  The court therefore grants Petitioner’s
petition. 
ORDER
            The court grants petitioner Maria
Lorena Concepción Holguin Puentes’s petition for approval of compromise of
claim on behalf of minor claimant Grecia Ruby Bedolla. 
            The court sets an Order to Show
Cause re: proof of purchase of annuity (as to minor claimant Grecia Ruby
Bedolla) for hearing on October 11, 2024, at 8:30 a.m., in Department 53.
            The court orders petitioner Maria
Lorena Concepción Holguin Puentes to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
