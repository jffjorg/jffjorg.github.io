[1] The
court did not consider the corrected opposition papers, filed and served by
plaintiff John Christian Lukes on July 31, 2024, because those papers were not
filed and served not less than 14 days preceding the continued hearing date on
this motion.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c,
subd. (b)(2).) 


[2] The
court notes that the objections are not numbered as required.  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1354, subd. (b) [“Each
written objection must be numbered consecutively . . . .”].)  The court has ruled on the objections in
numerical order. 


[3] On June
28, 2022, the court issued an order (1) sustaining the demurrer filed by all of
the defendants to Plaintiff’s second and eighth causes of action, and (2) stating
that if Plaintiff did not file a Second Amended Complaint within 20 days of the
date of the court’s order, the defendants were to file an answer to the First
Amended Complaint within 40 days of the date of the court’s order.  (June 28, 2022 Order, pp. 5:7-8, 5:19-20, 6:1-3.)  Plaintiff did not file a Second Amended
Complaint.  


[4] Even if
the court were to find that this shows that there was no consideration,
Plaintiff has met his burden to show that a triable issue of material fact exists
as to whether McNamara disclosed this information to Stearns and Nowak, who then
gave the information to Plaintiff.  (Pl.
COE, Ex. A, Pl. Decl., ¶ 3; Pl. COE, Ex. C, Stearns Decl., ¶ 2; Pl. COE, Ex. D,
Nowak Decl., ¶ 2.)
