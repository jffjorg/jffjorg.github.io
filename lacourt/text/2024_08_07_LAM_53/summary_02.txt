And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion, stating that the court did not consider the corrected opposition papers filed by the plaintiff, John Christian Lukes, because they were not filed and served at least 14 days before the continued hearing date. The court also notes that the objections were not numbered as required, but has ruled on them in numerical order. The court previously issued an order sustaining the demurrer filed by the defendants to the plaintiff's second and eighth causes of action, and the plaintiff did not file a Second Amended Complaint. Despite this, the plaintiff has met his burden to show that a triable issue of material fact exists regarding whether information was disclosed to Stearns and Nowak, who then gave the information to the plaintiff.
