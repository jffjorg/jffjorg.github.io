ANALYSIS: 
 
Petitioner Felix, LLC (“Petitioner”), filed a Petition for
Release of Mechanic’s Lien against Respondent Global Plumbing & Fire Supply
(“Respondent”) on March 30, 2023. The Petition came for hearing on August 3,
2023, at which time the Court ordered Petitioner to file and serve an Amended
Petition that included a legal description of the property that is subject to
the lien. (Minute Order, 08/03/23.) Petitioner filed an Amended Petition on
August 21, 2023. No response to the Petitions has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
Petitioner moves to have the mechanic’s lien recorded
against their property by Respondent released. The Petition is brought pursuant
to Civil Code section 8480, which provides that the owner of property may
petition the court for an order to release the property from the claim of lien
if the claimant has not commenced an action to enforce the lien within the time
provided in section 8460. (Civil Code, § 8480, subd. (a).)  
 
Section 8460 provides that “[t]he claimant shall commence an
action to enforce a lien within 90 days after recordation of the claim of
lien.” (Civil Code, § 8460, subd. (a).) Section 8460 further provides that
“[i]f the claimant does not commence an action to enforce the lien within that
time, the claim of lien expires and is unenforceable.” (Civil Code, § 8460,
subd. (a).) Section 8460 also provides that the 90-day time limit to commence
an action to enforce a lien does not apply if there was an agreement to extend
credit and a notice of that fact was recorded within 90 days after recordation
of the claim of lien or more than 90 days after recordation of the claim of
lien but before a purchaser or encumbrancer for value and in good faith
acquires rights in the property.  (Civil
Code, § 8460, subd. (b).)  
 
A property owner may not petition for a release order until
he or she gives the claimant notice demanding that the claimant execute and
record a release of lien claim at least ten days before filing the petition.
(Civil Code, § 8482.) Civil Code section 8484 requires that the petition for
release order be verified by the petitioner and allege the following:
 
(a) The date of recordation of the
claim of lien. A certified copy of the claim of lien shall be attached to the petition.
(b) The county in which the claim of
lien is recorded.
(c) The book and page or series number
of the place in the official records where the claim of lien is recorded.
(d) The legal description of the
property subject to the claim of lien.
(e) Whether an extension of credit has
been granted under Section 8460, if so to what date, and that the time for
commencement of an action to enforce the lien has expired.
(f) That the owner has given the
claimant notice under Section 8482 demanding that the claimant execute and
record a release of the lien and that the claimant is unable or unwilling to do
so or cannot with reasonable diligence be found.
(g) Whether an action to enforce the
lien is pending.
(h) Whether the owner of the property
or interest in the property has filed for relief in bankruptcy or there is
another restraint that prevents the claimant from commencing an action to
enforce the lien.
 
(Civil Code, § 8484.)
 
Civil Code section 8486, subdivision (b) requires service to
“be made in the same manner as service of summons, or by certified or
registered mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested . . . .” (Civ. Code,
§ 8486, subd. (b).) Petitioner filed proof of service of the Amended Petition
by substitute service. (Proof of Personal Service, filed 08/30/23.) This
conforms to the statutory requirements for service of the Petition. However,
the proof of service does not indicate that Petitioner provided Respondent with
notice of the August 3, 2023 order and continued hearing date, as also ordered.
(See Minute Order, 08/03/23.) 
 
 Regarding the merits,
Petitioner has satisfied the requirements of Civil Code section 8484. (Pet.,
¶¶1-8 and Exhs. A-B.) There is no indication that an action to enforce the lien
has been commenced and the 90-day time period to commence an action has
expired. (Ibid.) Petitioner also requests attorney’s fees and costs.
Pursuant to a lodestar calculation, attorney’s fees of $2,028.00 based on six
hours of work at an hourly rate of $338.00 are appropriate. (Pet., ¶7.)
Petitioner may also be awarded costs of $610.00. (Ibid.)

Petitioner Felix, LLC’s Petition
to Release Property from Mechanic’s Lien is CONTINUED TO NOVEMBER 29, 2023 AT
8:30 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE. BY NOVEMBER 8, 2023,
