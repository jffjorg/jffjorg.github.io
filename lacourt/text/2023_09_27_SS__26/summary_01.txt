The judge has denied the cross-complainant's motions to compel further responses to form interrogatories and requests for production of documents, as well as their request for sanctions. The cross-complainant had filed the motions after serving the plaintiffs with form interrogatories and requests for production of documents, but the plaintiffs had only responded with objections. The cross-complainant had also sent a meet and confer letter, but the judge found that the cross-complainant had not made a sufficient effort to meet and confer with the plaintiffs to resolve the discovery disputes. Additionally, the judge noted that the cross-complainant's motions were filed after the statutory deadline for discovery motions, and that the judge's discretion to grant the motions was bounded by the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050.
