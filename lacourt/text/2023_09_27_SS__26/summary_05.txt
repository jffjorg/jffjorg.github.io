And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion to vacate the entry of default filed by Defendant Bipin Gala is continued to November 29, 2023. By November 8, 2023, Defendant Gala must file and serve a supplemental declaration of fault. If the declaration is not filed, the motion may be denied. The motion was filed on August 29, 2023, and Plaintiff filed only evidentiary objections to the supporting evidence without a supporting memorandum. The judge finds that the supporting declaration of fault is inadequate and that defense counsel cannot attest to Defendant Gala's beliefs. Therefore, Defendant Gala must submit their own declaration to demonstrate fault under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b).
