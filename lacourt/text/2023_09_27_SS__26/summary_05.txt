The motion was filed on August 29, 2023, and Plaintiff filed only evidentiary objections to the supporting evidence without a supporting memorandum. The judge finds that the supporting declaration of fault is inadequate and that defense counsel cannot attest to Defendant Gala's beliefs. Therefore, Defendant Gala must submit their own declaration to demonstrate fault under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b).

## English Summary

The judge is temporarily delaying a decision on Defendant Bipin Gala's request to dismiss the default judgment against him.  Gala argues his failure to file a response to the lawsuit was a mistake. However, the judge found the initial evidence submitted by Gala's attorney insufficient, as it relied on hearsay and lacked personal knowledge. 

Gala must now submit a new declaration, signed by him, explaining the reasons for his late response. If this new declaration is not filed by November 8th, the judge will likely deny Gala's request to dismiss the default judgment.  A new hearing is scheduled for November 29th to discuss the matter further.

English text:
The tentative ruling states that Defendant Bipin Gala's Motion to Vacate Entry of Default is continued to November 29, 2023. By November 8, 2023, Defendant Bipin Gala must file and serve a supplemental declaration of fault. Failure to do so may result in the motion being denied. The motion was found to be timely filed within six months of the entry of default and a copy of Defendant Gala's answer.
