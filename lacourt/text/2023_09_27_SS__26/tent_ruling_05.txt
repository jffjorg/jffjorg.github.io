ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Luis Marquez (“Plaintiff”)
filed the instant action for civil rights violations against Defendants Bipin
Gala (“Defendant Gala”) and Yvonne Magana aka Ibon Magana (“Defendant Magana”) on
June 1, 2023. Defendant Magana filed an answer on August 7, 2023. Following
Defendant Gala’s failure to file a responsive pleading, the Court entered their
default on August 11, 2023. 
 
Defendant Gala filed the instant
Motion to Vacate Default on August 29, 2023. On August 31, 2023, Plaintiff
filed only evidentiary objections to the evidence in support of the Motion,
with no supporting memorandum.
 
Discussion
 
The
Motion is brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision
(b). Under this statute, an application for relief must be made no more than
six months after entry of the order from which relief is sought and must be
accompanied by an affidavit of fault attesting to the mistake, inadvertence,
surprise or neglect of the moving party or its attorney. (Code Civ. Proc., §
473, subd. (b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th
130, 143.) The motion must also be accompanied by a copy of the moving
defendant’s proposed pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) When based
on an attorney affidavit of fault, the relief sought must be granted if the
statutory requirements are satisfied. (Leader v. Health Industries of
America, Inc. (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 603, 612.) When brought pursuant to the
provision for discretionary relief based on party fault, the request must have
been filed within a reasonable amount of time. 
 
The Motion is timely brought
within six months of entry of default and a copy of Defendant Gala’s answer.
(Motion, Exh. A.) However, Plaintiff objects and the Court agrees that the
supporting declaration of fault is inadequate. The declaration is by defense
counsel regarding Defendant Gala's belief that the answer filed on behalf of
Defendant Magana would also be on Defendant Gala’s behalf. (Motion, Kritikos
Decl., ¶8.) Defense counsel, however, cannot attest to Defendant Gala’s belief
and the objection to the statements therein as hearsay and lacking personal
knowledge are sustained. Defendant Gala must submit their own declaration to
demonstrate fault under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). 
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, Defendant Bipin Gala’s
Motion to Vacate Entry of Default is CONTINUED TO NOVEMBER 29, 2023. BY
NOVEMBER 8, 2023 DEFENDANT BIPIN GALA IS TO FILE AND SERVE A SUPPLEMENTAL
DECLARATION OF FAULT. FAILURE TO DO SO MAY RESULT IN THE MOTION BEING DENIED.
