ANALYSIS: 
 
On
August 1, 2019, Plaintiffs Antonio Cabral and Patricia Cabral (“Plaintiffs”)
filed this action for trespass, trespass to chattles, and conversion against
Defendant Carlos M. Quintana (“Defendant Quintana”). Plaintiffs filed a First
Amended Complaint on March 5, 2020 adding Quint Tax Services Corporation as a
defendant, and causes of action for nuisance and negligence. Defendant Quint
Tax Services Corporation (“Cross-Complainant”) filed an answer and
Cross-Complaint on March 11, 2021. A First Amended Cross-Complaint was filed
against Plaintiffs and Rise Again Printing, LLC on September 24, 2021. 
 
On
February 9, 2022, the Court set a trial date of September 11, 2023. Plaintiffs
filed a motion to reclassify the action to the limited jurisdiction court on
July 28, 2023.  
 
On
August 21, 2023, Cross-Complainant filed six motions to compel further
responses, which were set to be heard after the September 11, 2023 trial date.
On August 23, 2023, the Court granted the motion to reclassify and the case was
reassigned to the limited jurisdiction court on August 31, 2023. (Notice of
Case Reassignment, 08/31/23.) Plaintiffs’ counsel filed a Declaration Objecting
to Motions to Compel Further on September 1, 2023.  
 
Discussion 
 
For hearing before
the Court are Cross-Complainant’s (1) Motion to Compel Patricia Cabral to
Further Respond to Form Interrogatories, Set 20, and for Sanctions; and (2)
Motion to Compel Antonio Cabral to Further Respond to Requests for Production
of Documents, Set 2, and for Sanctions.
 
Cross-Complainant
served Form Interrogatories, Set 20, and Requests for Production of Documents,
Set 2, on Plaintiffs on July 10, 2023. (Motions, Jackson Decl., Exh. 1.) On
August 9, 2023, Plaintiff served responses containing objections. (Id.
at Exh. 4.) Cross-Complainant sent a meet and confer letter on August 16, 2023
demanding full and complete responses by August 18, 2023. (Id. at Exh.
7.) After hearing no response from Plaintiffs, Cross-Complainant filed the
instant discovery motions on August 21, 2023.  (Id. at ¶15.) 
 
Trial in this action
was initially set for September 11, 2023, making the corresponding cutoffs for
discovery and discovery motions, August 12, 2023 and August 27, 2023,
respectively. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (a).) Counsel for
Cross-Complainant mistakenly states that the motion deadline pertains to the filing
of discovery motions, however, that is incorrect. (See Motions, Jackson Decl.,
¶15.) The August 27, 2023 deadline concerns the hearing of discovery
motions. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020 [“Except as otherwise provided in this
chapter, any party shall be entitled as a matter of right to complete discovery
proceedings on or before the 30th day, and to have motions concerning
discovery heard on or before the 15th day, before the date initially
set for the trial of the action.”] [emphasis added].) The instant discovery
motions, therefore, are set to be heard after the statutory cutoff.  
 
The Court cannot
grant discovery motions after the cutoff date unless the moving party has moved
under Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050 to have the motions heard closer
to the trial date. (Pelton-Shepherd Industries, Inc. v. Delta Packaging
Products, Inc. (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1568, 1586-1587.) The Court’s
discretion in allowing the motions to be heard closer to the trial date than
allowed by Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.020 is bounded by the
requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050, which include
submission of a meet and confer declaration and the trial court’s consideration
of the statutory factors. (Ibid.) In other words, it would be an abuse
of discretion for the Court to grant these discovery motions without evidence
of the required meet and confer effort and without considering the statutory
factors for a continuance of the discovery deadlines. No meet and confer
regarding such a continuance is in the record, however, nor is there any
discussion of such factors in the motion.  
 
Conclusion 
 
Therefore, Cross-Complainant Quint Tax Services Corp.’s (1) Motion to
Compel Patricia Cabral to Further Respond to Form Interrogatories, Set 20, and
for Sanctions; and (2) Motion to Compel Antonio Cabral to Further Respond to
Requests for Production of Documents, Set 2, and for Sanctions, are DENIED.
