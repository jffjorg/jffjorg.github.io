And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted defendant Oluwajuwon Ajayi's motion for relief from admissions. The defendant's law firm was in disarray due to attorney resignations, resulting in delays in serving responses and verifications to discovery responses. The judge finds that this was excusable neglect and that the admissions were not the result of intentional conduct. Therefore, the judge has vacated the court order dated December 12, 2022, and relieved the defendant from the admissions.
