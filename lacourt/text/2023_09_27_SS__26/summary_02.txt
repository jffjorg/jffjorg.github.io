## English Summary

The judge has tentatively ruled to grant Defendant Oluwajuwon Ajayi's motion for relief from admissions made in a previous court order. 

The ruling stems from a situation where Defendant's law firm experienced significant staff turnover, resulting in delayed responses to discovery requests. The judge finds this delay constituted "excusable neglect" and that Plaintiff will not be substantially prejudiced by vacating the previous order deeming the admissions true. 

The original order, granting Plaintiff's motion to deem requests for admission admitted, was based on these admissions and led to a judgment in Plaintiff's favor. The Defendant's previous motion to vacate the judgment was granted, setting the stage for this motion for relief from admissions.

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for relief from admissions, which means that the court's previous order deeming the defendant's admissions as admitted is vacated. The defendant's law firm was in disarray due to mass resignations, which resulted in delays and errors in handling the case. The judge finds that the defendant's admissions were the result of excusable neglect and therefore exercises its discretion to relieve the defendant from the admissions.
