ANALYSIS:
 
Defendant 1683-85 Longwood Avenue, LLC (“Defendant”)
propounded Form Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, and
Requests for Admission, Set One, on Plaintiff Dadson Washer Service, Inc.
(“Plaintiff”) on March 3, 2023. (Motions, Uzoh Decl., Exh. A.) Following
Plaintiff’s failure to respond, Defendant sought to meet and confer. (Id.
¶¶3-6 and Exhs. B-C.) When there was no response from Plaintiff after the
extended deadlines, Defendant filed the instant (1) Motion to Compel Answers to
Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request For Sanctions; (2) Motion to Compel
Answers to Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request For Sanctions; and (3)
Motion to Deem Requests for Admission, Set One, Admitted, and Request For
Sanctions on August 31, 2023. (Id. at ¶3 and Exh. B.) No opposition has
been filed. 
 
Discussion
 
Based on Plaintiff’s failure to serve initial responses to
the discovery, the Motions to compel responses to interrogatories, and to deem
admissions admitted, are granted. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290; 2033.280.)
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort before a motion to
compel initial responses or deem admissions admitted can be filed. (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290; 2033.280.) Further, the motion can be brought at any time
after the responding party fails to provide the responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290; 2033.280.) Therefore, Defendant is entitled to an order compelling Plaintiff
to serve verified responses to the interrogatories without objections. The
Court also deems the requests for admission admitted against Plaintiff. 
 
Plaintiff’s failure to timely respond to the requests also
constitutes a misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010,
subd. (d).) Sanctions are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections
2033.280, 2023.010 and 2023.030 and have been properly noticed. However, the
amount sought is excessive under a lodestar calculation. Therefore, the
requests for sanctions are granted against Plaintiff in the amount of $700.00
based on two hours of attorney time billed at $350.00 an hour. (Motions, Uzoh
Decl., ¶9.) The sanctions are to be paid within 20 days of service of this
order.
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant 1683-85 Longwood Avenue, LLC’s (1) Motion to Compel Answers to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and for
Monetary Sanctions; (2) Motion to
Compel Answers to Special
Interrogatories, Set One, and for Monetary Sanctions and (3) Motion Deeming
Requests for Admission, Set One, Admitted, and for Monetary Sanctions are GRANTED.
PLAINTIFF DADSON WASHER SERVICE, INC. IS TO SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES TO THE
