```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court will likely deny the plaintiff's motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary injunction (PI) to prevent defendants from violating a non-compete agreement. The plaintiff purchased Plixi from defendants and obtained a non-compete agreement, which prohibits defendants from engaging in activities that compete with Plixi. However, the court is not convinced that the plaintiff has made a sufficient showing to justify the relief sought. The court is concerned about the delay in bringing the motion, the lack of irreparable harm, and the fact that the harm, if any, can be rectified through damages. The court also has questions about the relationship between defendants and Sequoia, which is responsible for the merchant account for Upgrow, a competing website to Plixi. A new motion would be the better course to pursue for the plaintiff.
