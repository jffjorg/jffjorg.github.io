The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to tax costs in a case. The case was previously dismissed, but the defendant is seeking to recover the cost of a first appearance fee. The court notes that the defendant incurred the cost unnecessarily, but the court cannot say that the cost memorandum is out of time. The court denies the motion to tax costs, as there is no advantage to the defense in incurring the fee unnecessarily and then recovering it.
