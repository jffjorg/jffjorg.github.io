And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court has reviewed the demurrer filed by Recontrust Company (RC) and has found that the plaintiff's allegations do not set forth a cause of action. Specifically, the court has found that RC is not the holder of the beneficial interests, but rather Bank of New York Mellon (BONY) is. The court has also found that the complaint does not plead fraud with the requisite specificity, and that the complaint does not plead unfair or unlawful activities with sufficient detail. As a result, the court has sustained the demurrer, but has given the plaintiff leave to amend the complaint.
