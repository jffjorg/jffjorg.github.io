 Case Number:  21STCV41652    Hearing Date:   October 10, 2024    Dept:  57 The Court is granting Plaintiff's motion to quash the four subpoenas that Defendants issued to Plaintiff's former employers for the production of her employment records.  Plaintiff improperly combined four motions into one and the Court could have denied the motion on that ground.  The Court has, however, exercised its discretion to consider the motion.   The Court has concluded that Defendants have not shown  a valid basis for the production of the employment records that would override Plaintiff's interest in maintaining the privacy of the records.  The Court will elaborate on this conclusion at the hearing on the motion.
