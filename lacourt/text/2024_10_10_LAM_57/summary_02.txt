And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff's motion to quash the four subpoenas issued by the defendants to the plaintiff's former employers for the production of employment records will be granted. The judge notes that the plaintiff combined four motions into one, which could have been grounds for denial. However, the judge has chosen to exercise its discretion and consider the motion. The judge concludes that the defendants have not shown a valid reason for producing the employment records that would outweigh the plaintiff's interest in maintaining the privacy of those records. The judge will elaborate on this conclusion at the hearing on the motion.
