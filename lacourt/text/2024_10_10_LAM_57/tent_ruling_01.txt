  Case Number:  21STCV37502    Hearing Date:   October 10, 2024    Dept:  57 The Court is denying Zvi Sperling's motion to bifurcate the trial.  The "equity first" rule on which the bifurcation motion relies is inapplicable.  That is because the gist of the claims that Zvi has asserted in his operative Third Amended Complaint against Jacob and Naomi Sperling are legal in nature and thus must be tried before a jury, except the claim against Jacob for specific performance, which the Court could hear in a bench trial if the jury returns a verdict in Zvi's favor on his breach of contract claim against Jacob.  Zvi's dissolution claims against Maxim Lighting International, Inc. and Lucca Concepts, Inc. are equitable.  But as Zvi himself previously acknowledged, the dissolution claims are intertwined with Zvi's claims against Jacob and Naomi.  If necessary after the jury trial, the Court can hear the dissolution claims in a bench trial.  Additionally, the Court disagrees with Zvi's argument that his bifurcation request would promote efficiency.
