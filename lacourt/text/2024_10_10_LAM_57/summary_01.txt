And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Zvi Sperling's motion to bifurcate the trial. Zvi's claims against Jacob and Naomi Sperling are legal in nature and must be tried by a jury, except for the specific performance claim against Jacob, which could be heard in a bench trial. Zvi's dissolution claims against Maxim Lighting International, Inc. and Lucca Concepts, Inc. are equitable, but are intertwined with his claims against Jacob and Naomi. The judge disagrees with Zvi's argument that bifurcation would promote efficiency and instead plans to hear the dissolution claims in a bench trial if necessary after the jury trial.
