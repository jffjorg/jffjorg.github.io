And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the administrator of the Estate of Sherri Conway regarding a complaint filed by Collen Sartinsky. The court finds that Sartinsky's first claim, alleging breach of fiduciary duty, would be barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel because the court's judgment in the Estate of Keith Conway renders the underlying proposition invalid. The court also finds that Sartinsky's third claim, alleging fraudulent transfer of the Gale Property to the Bouldin Trust, would be barred by collateral estoppel when the judgment in the Estate of Keith Conway becomes final. However, the court notes that the judgment in the Estate of Keith Conway is not yet final, and therefore declines to rule on the motion for judgment on the pleadings. The court also denies the motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the fourth claim for declaratory relief, as it does not stand or fall on the proposition that Keith owned 50% of the Gale Property at the time of his death.
