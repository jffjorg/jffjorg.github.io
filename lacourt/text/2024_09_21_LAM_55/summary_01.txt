And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion filed by counsel for the plaintiff, Nicolas Walker, to be relieved as attorney of record in the employment discrimination case against LAUSD. The judge found that the motion was sufficient and that the moving counsel had shown a cognizable ground for withdrawal due to client conduct (failure to communicate with counsel) that renders it unreasonably difficult for the lawyer to carry out the representation. Since no opposing document has been filed showing any prejudice to the client, the judge granted the motion and will sign the proposed order submitted by counsel.
