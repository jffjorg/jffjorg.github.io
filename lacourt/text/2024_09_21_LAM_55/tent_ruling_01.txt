  Case Number:  23STCV17541    Hearing Date:   September 21, 2024    Dept:  55 23STCV07541
Motion to be Relieved as Attorney of Record
 
This is an employment discrimination case brought by Plaintiff
Nicolas Walker against Defendant LAUSD. Counsel for Plaintiff has filed a
motion to be relieved as counsel. 
“The determination whether to grant or deny an
attorney’s motion to withdraw as counsel of record lies within the sound
discretion of the trial court, having in mind whether such withdrawal might
work an injustice in the handling of the case.” Lempert v. Sup. Ct.
(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1173. 
Here, the form notice, declaration, proposed order,
and proof of service sufficiently comply with the requirements for a motion to
be relieved as counsel. See
Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. 
Further, moving counsel’s declaration shows a
cognizable ground for withdrawal: Client conduct (failure to communicate with
counsel) that renders is unreasonably difficult for the lawyer to carry out the
representation. Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 1.16(b)(4). 
Finally, no opposing document has been filed showing
any prejudice to the client. See Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 1.16(d). 
Therefore, the motion is granted, and the Court will
sign the proposed order submitted by counsel.
