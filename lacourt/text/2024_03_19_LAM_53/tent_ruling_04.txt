[1] Pursuant
to the court’s March 4, 2024 order, the court considered the “Supplemental
Declaration of Douglas L. Day in Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for
Protective Order” for the limited purpose of reviewing the copy of Exhibit A
that was inadvertently omitted from the earlier declaration.  The court did not consider any other facts
set forth therein. 


[2] The court
finds that the conversations between counsel at the deposition do not
constitute a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of the
issues presented by the motion, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section
2016.040.
