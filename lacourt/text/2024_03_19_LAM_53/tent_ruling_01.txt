[Tentative]
  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s request for court judgment by
  default
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                Plaintiff Shuwen Li
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       n/a
Request for Court Judgment by Default 
Plaintiff Shuwen Li (“Plaintiff”) requests that the court enter
default judgment in Plaintiff’s favor and against defendants Timothy Pojim,
Yonatan Daniel, and Dajohn Wade (“Defendants”) in the total amount of
$53,980.54, consisting of (1) $53,172 in damages, and (2) $808.54 in costs. 
First, the court notes that it cannot award damages in the amount of $53,172
as requested, because Plaintiff prayed for damages in the total amount of
$50,000.  (Compl., p. 2, ¶ 10, p. 3
[PLD-C-001(1)], ¶ BC-4, p. 4 [PLD-C-001(2)], ¶ CC-2; Airs
Aromatics, LLC v. CBL Data Recovery Technologies, Inc. (2018) 23
Cal.App.5th 1013, 1018 [“A default judgment greater than the amount
specifically demanded in the complaint is void as beyond the court’s
jurisdiction”].)  Thus, the court must
limit the award of damages to $50,000.  (Ibid.)

Second, the court finds that Plaintiff has proven that it is entitled
to damages in the reduced amount of $50,000. 
(Li Decl., ¶¶ 1, 2 [“the total unpaid rent was $33,100”], 3 [Plaintiff
expended $20,072 to repair and replace property items].) 
Third, the court finds that the $808.54 in costs requested are
permitted under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5. 
Thus, the court finds that Plaintiff has proven that Plaintiff is
entitled to default judgment in their favor and against Defendants in the total
amount of $50,808.54. 
However, the court notes that Plaintiff has not filed a Request for
Dismissal of the Doe defendants as required by California Rules of Court, rule
3.1800.  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1800,
subd. (a)(7); Compl., p. 1, ¶ 1 [naming as defendants Doe defendants 1 to
5].)  Plaintiff may file a Request for
Dismissal (CIV-110) or make an oral request to dismiss the Doe defendants at
the hearing on the Order to Show Cause re entry of default judgment. 
Once the Doe defendants are dismissed, the court will enter court
judgment by default in favor of plaintiff Shuwen Li and against defendants
Timothy Pojim, Yonatan Daniel, and Dajohn Wade in the total amount of
$50,808.54, consisting of $50,000 in damages and $808.54 in costs. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  March 19, 2024
