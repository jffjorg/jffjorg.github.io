plaintiff’s motion for protective order
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff DB Maple Avenue, LLC      
 
RESPONDING PARTIES:     Defendants 450 Maple Condominium Owners
Association, LB Property Management, Inc., Pamela Maxwell, Susan Yeung, and
Victoria Lerman
Motion for Protective Order
The court
considered the moving, opposition, reply, and supplemental[1]
papers filed in connection with this motion. 
EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
The court sustains plaintiff DB Maple Avenue, LLC’s evidentiary
objection to the declaration of Pamela Maxwell in its entirety because the
declaration was not signed under penalty of perjury by the declarant as
required by Code of Civil Procedure section 2015.5.
 
The court rules on plaintiff DB Maple Avenue, LLC’s evidentiary
objections to the declaration of Douglas L. Day as follows:
Objections Nos. 1, 3, and 5-11 are overruled. 
Objections Nos. 2 and 4 are sustained. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff DB Maple Avenue, LLC (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for
an order (1) issuing a protective order that counsel for defendants 450 Maple
Condominium Owners Association, LB Property Management, Inc., Pamela Maxwell
(“Maxwell”), Susan Yeung, and Victoria Lerman (collectively, “Defendants”),
Douglas L. Day (“Counsel”), shall not (i) pass notes to any future deponent,
including defendant Maxwell, and (ii) coach witnesses or obstruct depositions
and testimony, and (2) awarding monetary sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and
against Defendants in the amount of $10,194.84.
“The court, for good cause shown, may make any order that justice
requires to protect any party, deponent, or other natural person or
organization from unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression, or undue
burden and expense.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.420, subd. (b).) 
A motion for a protective order “shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Section 2016.040.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.420, subd. (a).) 
The court finds that Plaintiff has not submitted a declaration
that satisfies Code of Civil Procedure section 2016.040 and therefore denies
Plaintiff’s motion.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2025.420, subd. (a), 2016.040.) 
The court acknowledges that (1) the parties do not dispute that
Counsel passed a note to Maxwell during her deposition, and (2) Counsel has now
submitted a copy of the note, which states the following:  “He is co-owner [of] DB MAPLE[.]”  (Day Decl., ¶ 14 [authenticating note]; Supp.
Day Decl., Ex. A.)  The court further notes that it appears that Counsel
might have been able to avoid the filing of this motion (1) by producing the
note during Maxwell’s deposition or after the suspension of her deposition, and/or
(2) by agreeing not to pass any further notes to Maxwell and future deponents.  (Kashfian Decl., Ex. 16, Maxwell Dep., pp.
25:8-14 [responding “No” when asked if Plaintiff’s counsel could see the note],
26:3-17 [declining to offer copy of the note or to state its contents],
26:22-27:3, 27:20-28:16 [stating that Counsel would not answer Plaintiff’s
counsel’s question as to whether he would continue to pass notes during the
deposition].)  However, the court finds that Plaintiff’s counsel did not adequately
meet and confer with Defendants’ counsel after Maxwell’s deposition was
suspended[2] and before Plaintiff
filed the pending motion.  
“A meet and confer declaration in
support of a motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith
attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.)  Plaintiff’s December 18, 2023 and December 19,
2023 letters do not attempt to informally resolve the issues that arose during
Maxwell’s deposition.  The December 18,
2023 letter, while stating that counsel “would prefer to find an informal
resolution[,]” also stated that counsel “fe[lt] that under the circumstances[,]
[counsel was] left with no choice but to seek court intervention.”  (Kashfian Decl., Ex. 17, p. 2.)  The letter further stated that its intent was
to provide notice that Plaintiff intended to file, inter alia, a motion for a
protective order.  (Kashfian Decl., Ex.
17, p. 3.)  Similarly, the December 19,
2023 letter states Plaintiff’s expectation to file a motion for a protective
order and the bases for such a motion. 
(Kashfian Decl., Ex. 19, pp. 1, 5.) 
Neither the December 18, 2023 nor December 19, 2023 letters (1)
requested to view the note again, (2) sought an assurance that Counsel would no
longer engage in the objectionable conduct, or (3) otherwise suggested
appropriate redress outside of motion practice. 
Instead, as set forth above, the letters merely informed Defendants of
Plaintiff’s intention to file the pending motion for a protective order. 
The court therefore finds that
Plaintiff did not meet its burden to show that it engaged in “a reasonable and
good faith attempt at information resolution of each issue” presented in this
motion after the suspension of Maxwell’s deposition and before filing this
motion.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2016.040.) 
Moreover, even if Plaintiff had shown that it adequately met and
conferred with Defendants, the court would find that Plaintiff’s request for a
protective order directing Counsel not to take future actions during
depositions is moot.  On March 12, 2024,
Defendants each filed a form entitled “Substitution of Attorney – Civil”
(Judicial Council form MC-050), stating that they were substituting Seymour B.
Everett, III as their attorney in place of Counsel in this action.  Thus, there is no longer any need to issue a
protective order barring Counsel from engaging in certain conduct since he is
no longer counsel of record for Defendants. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.420, subd. (b).)
ORDER
            The court denies plaintiff DB Maple
Avenue, LLC’s motion for protective order. 
            The court orders defendants
450 Maple Condominium Owners Association, LB Property Management, Inc., Pamela
Maxwell, Susan Yeung, and Victoria Lerman to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
