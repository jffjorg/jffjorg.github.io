plaintiff’s request for court judgment by

MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Ivan Mendoza           
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       n/a
Request for Court Judgment by Default
Against Defendant Soon Pill Kim
Plaintiff Ivan Mendoza
(“Plaintiff”) requests that the court enter judgment by default against
defendant Soon Pill Kim (“Defendant”) in the total amount of $353,421.59,
consisting of (1) $1,500 in damages, (2) $138,551.04 in interest, (3) $5,435.55
in costs, and (4) $207,935 in attorney’s fees.  (Request for Court Judgment filed Mar. 4,
2024, CIV-100 (“Mar. 4, 2024 CIV-100”), ¶ 2, subd. (a).)  
Plaintiff previously requested
that the court enter default judgment against Defendant in this amount.  (Request for Court Judgment filed December
20, 2023, CIV-100, ¶ 2.)  On January
5, 2024, the court issued an order (1) finding, inter alia, that
Plaintiff did not submit (i) evidence proving damages in the requested amount
of $1,500 or (ii) a case summary explaining the basis of the requested damages,
and (2) denied Plaintiff’s request for default judgment, without prejudice to
Plaintiff’s filing amended default judgment documents that cure the defects
described in the order.  (Jan. 5, 2024
Order, pp. 1:23-27, 2:13-15.) 
Thereafter, on March 4, 2024 and March 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
pending request for default judgment and supporting documents.
The court notes several
defects with Plaintiff’s request for default judgment. 
First, as set forth above,
Plaintiff requests $1,500 in damages against Defendant.  (Request for Court Judgment (CIV-100), filed March
4, 2024, ¶ 2, subd. (a); proposed Judgment, lodged March 4, 2024, ¶ 6,
subd. (a)(1).)  However, this request is
inconsistent with the statements made in Plaintiff’s supporting memorandum of
points and authorities.  Specifically,
Plaintiff has also stated the following:      (1) Defendant “is liable to Plaintiff in
the amount awarded to Plaintiff against [non-defaulted defendant Orange Trim,
Inc.] by the Court: $301,489.00” pursuant to agency law, the alter ego
doctrine, and as a joint employer; (2) Plaintiff requests that the court enter
judgment in his favor and against Defendant “on Causes of Action 1-3, and award
$94,320.00 in past lost earnings pursuant to those claims[;]” (3) Plaintiff
“believes he is entitled to $400,000.00 as a reasonable and common-sense award
for his past and future physical pain, mental suffering, and emotional
distress.”  (Pl. Memo, pp. 2:28-3:4,
6:22-24, 7:18-19, 11:10-13 [requesting $301,489 in wage and hour damages and
penalties, $20,000 in civil penalties, $94,320 in economic damages, and
$400,000 in non-economic damages].)  Thus,
Plaintiff’s request for default judgment made on the mandatory “Request for
Court Judgment” form is unclear and inconsistent with Plaintiff’s other default
judgment documents.  Moreover, Plaintiff
does not appear to have explained the basis for his request for damages in the
amount of $1,500.
Second, the prejudgment
interest calculations appear to be incorrect. 
The “Declaration re: Interest” filed by Plaintiff on March 4, 2024
states that it is based on the damages amount of $207,935, which (1) was not
requested in Plaintiff’s Request for Court Judgment, and (2) is inconsistent
with the explanation and calculations set forth in Plaintiff’s supporting memorandum.  (Declaration of Interest, MC-030 filed March
4, 2024, p. 1; Memo., p. 8:5-10.) 
Third, the request for costs
made on the “Request for Court Judgment” form is incomplete.  Plaintiff has requested $5,435.55 in costs,
but has only listed, in the memorandum of costs, $2,512.88 in filing fees and
$857 in process server’s fees (i.e., $3,369.88 in total costs).  (Request for Court Judgment (CIV-100), filed March
4, 2024, ¶ 7.)  Although Plaintiff
also appears to have submitted a cost memorandum to support this request,
Plaintiff must list the categories of costs on the mandatory “Request for Court
Judgment” Judicial Council form. 
For the reasons set forth
above, the court finds that Plaintiff has not met his burden to prove that he
is entitled to court judgment by default against Defendant in the amounts
requested.  The court therefore denies
Plaintiff’s request for default judgment against Defendant, without prejudice
to Plaintiff’s filing revised default judgment documents that cure the defects
described in this ruling.  
Finally, the court notes that,
at least as to some damages, Plaintiff asserts that Defendant is jointly and
severally liable with defendant Orange Trim, Inc.  (Memo., p. 2:25 [Defendant “is jointly and
severally liable” for wage and hour violations].)  The court exercises its discretion to defer
determination of the default judgment against defendant Soon Pill Kim until the
time of trial against defendant Orange Trim, Inc., and further orders that the
Order to Show Cause re entry of default judgment against Soon Pill Kim shall be
heard concurrently with trial against Orange Trim, Inc. 
The court continues the Order
to Show Cause re entry of default judgment against defendant Soon Pill Kim to
April 10, 2024, at 11:00 a.m., in Department 53. 
The court orders plaintiff
Ivan Mendoza to file a revised set of default judgment documents that (1) complies
with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1800 (including by lodging a proposed
judgment on Judicial Council Form JUD-100), and (2) corrects the defects set
forth above, no later than April 5, 2024. 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
