And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's ex parte application to continue the trial. The defendants have failed to meet the requirements for an ex parte order, which includes making an affirmative factual showing of irreparable harm or immediate danger. Additionally, the defendants have not shown good cause for requesting a continuance, as they have had since October 2022 to prepare for the trial and have not acted diligently to retain new counsel. The plaintiff would suffer prejudice from a continuance, and the court has denied the application. The defendants are ordered to give notice of this order.
