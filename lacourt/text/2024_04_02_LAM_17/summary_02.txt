And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has stayed the motion for attorneys' fees pending the disposition of the appeal. The defendants have appealed the court's judgment in favor of the plaintiff on the financial elder abuse claim. The court finds that it would be premature to rule on the motion for attorneys' fees without the disposition of the appeal, as there is a possibility that the appeal may render the motion moot.
