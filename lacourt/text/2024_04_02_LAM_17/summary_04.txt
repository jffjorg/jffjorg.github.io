And here is a summary in English text:

The California Department of Education (the Department) moves for reconsideration of a previous court order that excluded Clark Parker and Jeanette Parker, as Trustees of the Parker Trust, from the judgment. The Department argues that the Court mistakenly made this determination without giving the Department a fair opportunity to respond. The Department also argues that the judgment should include post-bankruptcy interest and should accurately state the name of the Parker's trust to ensure that the judgment can be enforced against the Parkers' property.

The Court grants the motion for reconsideration and will sign the Department's Second Amended Proposed Judgment filed on January 25, 2024. The Court finds that the previous judgment contained a clerical mistake and that the Court has inherent authority to correct this mistake.
