And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants defendant Adam Jeffrey Hall's motion to expunge the lis pendens notice recorded on the property at 2052 S. Hobart Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90018. The plaintiff, Sang Rim Son, filed a lawsuit against multiple defendants, alleging various claims including money due on default on note, fraud, negligence, financial abuse of elder, and quiet title. However, the court dismissed the case in its entirety on November 12, 2020. The defendant argues that the existence of the lis pendens is causing substantial prejudice and hindering his right to sell the property. The court finds that the plaintiff cannot establish the probable validity of a real property claim because the case was dismissed, and therefore grants the motion to expunge the lis pendens.
