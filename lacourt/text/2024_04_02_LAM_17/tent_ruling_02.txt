 Hearing Date: April 2, 2024




 
            Plaintiffs Michael Horner and Thomas Horner, as
Co-Trustees of the Horner Family Trust’s Motion for Attorneys’ Fees is STAYED
pending disposition of the appeal. 
 
            On May 11, 2021, Plaintiffs Michael Horner and Thomas
Horner, as Co-Trustees of the Horner Family Trust (Plaintiffs) filed this suit
against Defendants Strong Wealth Management LLC; George G. Strong III
(Defendants); and DOES 1-10, inclusive, alleging (1) fraud; (2) breach of
fiduciary duty; (3) negligence; (4) breach of contract; and (5) financial elder
abuse. 
 
            Plaintiffs move for an award of reasonable attorneys’
fees against Defendants in the sum of $672,036.50 plus costs shown in the
Memorandum of Costs filed on December 12, 2023.
 
Legal Standard
 
Pursuant
to Welfare & Institutions Code Section 15657.5(a), “Where it is proven by a
preponderance of the evidence that a defendant is liable for financial abuse,
as defined in Section 15610.30, in addition to compensatory damages and all
other remedies otherwise provided by law, the court shall award to the
plaintiff reasonable attorney’s fees and costs. The term “costs” includes, but
is not limited to, reasonable fees for the services of a conservator, if any,
devoted to the litigation of a claim brought under this article.” (Wel. &
Inst. Code § 15657.5(a).)
 
“ ‘Financial
abuse’ of an elder or dependent adult occurs when a person or entity does any
of the following: (1) Takes, secretes, appropriates, obtains, or retains
real or personal property of an elder or dependent adult for a wrongful use or
with intent to defraud, or both […] (2) Assists in taking, secreting,
appropriating, obtaining, or retaining real or personal property of an elder or
dependent adult for a wrongful use or with intent to defraud, or both […][or] (3) Takes,
secretes, appropriates, obtains, or retains, or assists in taking, secreting,
appropriating, obtaining, or retaining, real or personal property of an elder
or dependent adult by undue influence, as defined in Section 15610.70.” (Wel.
& Inst. Code § 15610.30(a).)
 
Discussion 
 
            This motion is made on the grounds that Plaintiffs’ are
entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in connection
with this lawsuit and enforcement of the judgment ordered because the Court
entered judgment in favor of Plaintiffs based on a finding of financial elder
abuse as defined in Welfare & Institutions Code Section 15657.5(a). 
 
            The parties dispute whether or not Plaintiffs’ are
entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees as under Welfare &
Institutions Code Section 15657.5(a).

Mr.
Lieb claims the ECJ paralegals who worked on the case in 2022 and 2023 have an
hourly rate ranging between $235 and $310. 
 
Hours
 
Mr.
Lieb claims ECJ attorneys spent approximately 1,250 hours to litigate this
case. 
 
Costs
 
Mr.
Lieb claims a total of $15,568.70 in costs consisting of: (1) $435 for filing
and motion fees; (2) $14,558.70 for deposition costs; and (3) $575.00 for court
reporter fees. 
 
In
justification for these hourly rates, Mr. Lieb provides the 2024 Judiciary
Salary Plan and Laffey Matrix. Mr. Lieb claims these documents indicate ECJ’s
rates in this case are consistently below what can be reasonably charged for
work by attorneys and staff with similar background and experience in the Los
Angeles Area. In their motion, Plaintiffs’ argue this matter was initially
scheduled to go to trial on June 6, 2022 but was postponed given two Chapter 13
filings by Defendant Strong. Plaintiffs further argue their counsel quickly
challenged these filings by filing a Motion for Relief from Stay in order to
proceed to trial in state court on their claims against Defendants and Motion
to Dismiss. Moreover, Plaintiffs contend they had to prepare motions in limine,
trial briefs, witness lists, exhibits and exhibits lists in preparation of the
trial. Similarly, Plaintiffs assert they were in trial for five days. 
 
In
opposition, Defendants argue they have challenged this Court’s finding of elder
abuse and that issue will be subject to appeal. Alternatively, Defendants
contend the Court should apportion the fees attributable to that cause of
action and Plaintiffs’ four other causes of action for fraud, breach of
contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and negligence, and award only those
attributable to the elder abuse claim. Defendants further contend Plaintiffs
were not successful on all of their causes of action because the Court denied
their fraud claim. Thus, Defendants argue it would be improper for the Court to
award the fees and costs that Plaintiffs incurred pursuing this failed cause of
action and are not available for either party in a fraud claim. Moreover,
Defendants asserts the elder abuse cause of action is entirely distinct from Plaintiffs’
three other successful claims. Defendants contend the contract did not provide
for attorneys’ fees, so awarding fees that were incurred on the other causes of
action would exceed the scope of that agreement the Court has enforced.
Defendants also assert Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that the award
they seek is warranted by any of the other relevant factors as Defendant Strong
is bankrupt and the Court already has entered a seven-figure judgment against
Defendant Strong including double damages for elder abuse. Additionally,
Defendants argue Plaintiffs may not recover attorneys’ fees in the bankruptcy
case unless and until they prevail there. Specifically, Defendants assert the
bankruptcy case is still pending and seeks to preclude the discharge of this
Court’s judgment. 
 
In
reply, Plaintiffs argue fees need not be apportioned because each of the causes
of action on which judgment was granted in their favor is directly tied to
Defendants’ financial abuse of Michael Horner. Further, Plaintiffs argue
Defendants’ financial condition does not support reducing fees. Plaintiffs also
argue the bankruptcy judge recently denied confirmation of Defendant Strong’s
proposed Chapter 13 Plan of Reorganization on the ground of Strong’s bad faith
and converted the bankruptcy to a Chapter 7. As this is new information being
introduced on reply, the Court cannot consider it. 
 
Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure Section 916 (a), “the perfecting of an appeal stays
proceedings in the trial court upon the judgment or order appealed from or upon
the matters embraced therein or affected thereby, including enforcement of the
judgment or order, but the trial court may proceed upon any other matter
embraced in the action and not affected by the judgment or order.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 916(a).) 
 
The
Court finds that this matter should be stayed pending the disposition of the
appeal. This instant motion is based on this Court’s judgment in favor of
Plaintiffs on the financial elder abuse claim. However, Defendants have filed
an appeal regarding that exact ruling. Thus, ruling on this motion would be
premature absent the disposition of the appeal as there is a possibility the
appeal may render this present motion moot. 
 
In
light of the foregoing, the motion for attorneys’ fees is STAYED.
