And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the Los Angeles Unified School District's motion for clarification, which is essentially a motion for reconsideration of the court's previous ruling. The motion seeks clarification on which issues and causes of action remain active for trial and whether the defendant can present affirmative defenses not discussed in the cross-motions for summary adjudication. The judge finds that the motion is untimely, as it was filed nine months after the court's order, and that it does not present any new or different facts, circumstances, or law. The judge also notes that the defendant does not cite any authority that would permit the court to issue an advisory opinion on issues not discussed in the cross-motions for summary adjudication.
