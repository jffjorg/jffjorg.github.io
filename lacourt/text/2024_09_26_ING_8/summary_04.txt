Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel arbitration and stay the lawsuit pending the outcome of the arbitration. The plaintiff had filed a complaint against multiple defendants, including Liberalis, LLC, alleging various labor law violations. However, the plaintiff had previously entered into a stipulation with some of the defendants (The Key defendants) to submit the case to binding arbitration. The judge found that the plaintiff did not waive the right to arbitrate and that the arbitration agreement was valid and enforceable. As a result, the court will set an arbitration status conference in early 2025 and ordered the plaintiff to give notice and post the arbitration fees within 30 days.
