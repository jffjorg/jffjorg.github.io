```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied the motion to disqualify the Yukevich Cavanaugh Firm from representing Asbestos Instant Response, Inc. (AIR) due to a conflict of interest. The motion was filed by Technion Contractors TCI, Inc. (TCI) after the firm associated a new lawyer, Mr. Guest, who had previously represented TCI in an opposing capacity. The Court acknowledged that AIR has met its burden of showing that Mr. Guest has not been involved in the defense of AIR in conflict with his earlier representation of TCI, and that the Yukevich firm took immediate and effective action to prevent any future basis for vicarious disqualification.

However, the Court has several concerns that need to be addressed at oral argument, including digital and mechanical barriers to prevent Guest from gaining access to the firm's files and papers, internal new matter dissemination, and steps to ensure that Guest's support staff do not discuss the AIR representation with him. If these concerns are adequately addressed, the Court would be inclined to deny the disqualification motion.
