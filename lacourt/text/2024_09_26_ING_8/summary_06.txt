And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering two motions to compel defendant Tung Ming and his insurer, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, to provide further responses to special interrogatories and inspection demands. The plaintiff, Jesse Franklin Esphorst, claims that the defendant's objections to the motion are without merit and that the information sought is necessary to enforce the money judgment.

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to inspection demands, Set One, and has ordered the defendant to provide the requested information by October 1, 2024. The judge has also granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories, but has denied the motion as to Special Interrogatory No. 8 and 9, which seek information about the defendant's family members.

The judge has also ordered oral argument on Special Interrogatory No. 23, which asks the defendant to identify all sources of his present support. The judge is allowing the parties to present evidence on this issue and will make a final decision after oral argument.

The judge has noted that the defendant's objections to the motion are without merit and that the information sought is necessary to enforce the money judgment. The judge has also noted that the defendant's failure to provide further responses to the special interrogatories and inspection demands is a violation of the court's orders.
