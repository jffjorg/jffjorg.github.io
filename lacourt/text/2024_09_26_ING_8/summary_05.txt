And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by AutoNation Ford Torrance to the fifth cause of action for Negligent Repair brought by Christopher S. Johnson Sr. against Ford Motor Company, AutoNation Ford Torrance, and others. The court has sustained the demurrer, finding that the plaintiff has failed to plead sufficient facts to state a cause of action against AutoNation. The court has also noted that the recent California Supreme Court decision in Rattagan v. Uber Technologies, Inc. (2024) 324 Cal.Rptr.3d 433 may affect the analysis of the economic loss rule and the wall of separation between tort and contract remedies. The court will invite oral argument as to whether the plaintiff believes he can legitimately amend his complaint consistent with the Rattagan Court's discussion of the economic loss rule. The court's tentative is to sustain the demurrer and allow the plaintiff the opportunity to argue whether leave to amend should be granted in light of the Rattagan decision.
