```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge is granting summary judgment on the intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) cause of action, finding that the plaintiff did not suffer sufficient emotional distress to meet the requirements for IIED. The judge also denies summary judgment on the remaining causes of action, finding that there are triable issues of fact regarding the extent and severity of the plaintiff's non-economic damages and economic damages.

The judge found that the defendant's actions were intentional and caused emotional distress, but that the plaintiff did not suffer severe emotional distress as required by law. The judge also found that the plaintiff's deposition testimony and psychologist's declaration raised triable issues of fact regarding the extent and severity of the plaintiff's non-economic damages and economic damages.

The judge noted that the Lee v. Bank of America case does not entirely support the defendant's position, as it allows for emotional suffering damages in cases involving intentional wrongdoing by the defendant. The judge also noted that the allegations in this case include intentional misconduct, and that there are triable issues on both economic and non-economic damages that warrant resolution by the trier of fact.
