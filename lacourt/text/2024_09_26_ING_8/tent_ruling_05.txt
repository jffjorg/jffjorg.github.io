I. BACKGROUND¿¿ 
¿¿ 
A. Factual¿¿ 
On April 8, 2024,
Plaintiff, Christopher S. Johnson Sr. (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against
Defendants, Ford Motor Company, AutoNation Ford Torrance, and DOES 1 through
10. The complaint alleges causes of action for: (1) Violation of Civil Code §
1793.2(d); (2) Violation of Civil Code § 1793.2(b); (3) Violation of Civil Code
§ 1793.2(a)(3); (4) Breach of the Implied Warranty of Merchantability – Civil
Code § 1791.1, 1794, and 1795.5; and (5) Fraudulent Inducement – Concealment;
and (6) Negligent Repair. 
 
On June 25, 2024, the
court sustained Defendant AutoNation’s demurrer to the cause of action for
negligent repair in the original complaint.
 
On July 17, 2024,
Plaintiff filed the first amended complaint (“FAC”), alleging causes of action
for: (1) Violation of Civil Code § 1793.2(d); (2) Violation of Civil Code §
1793.2(b); (3) Violation of Civil Code § 1793.2(a)(3); (4) Breach of the
Implied Warranty of Merchantability – Civil Code § 1791.1, 1794, and 1795.5; and
(5) Negligent Repair.  The FAC alleges
that on December 11, 2022, Plaintiff
entered into a warranty contract with Defendant Ford Motor Company regarding a
2020 Ford F150, and that defects and nonconformities to warranty developed,
including transmission
defects, body defects, and electrical defects.
            On August 20, 2024, AutoNation Ford Torrance filed a
Demurrer. On September 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition. On September 19,
2024, AutoNation filed a reply. 
III. ANALYSIS¿ 
¿ 
Legal Standard 
 
A demurrer can be used
only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack
or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) “To survive a demurrer, the complaint
need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary
fact that might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.” (C.A. v. William S. Hart
Union High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) For the purpose of
testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth
of all material facts properly pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist.
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.) A demurrer “does not admit contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co.
(1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.)¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
Discussion
 
AutoNation demurs to Plaintiff’s fifth
cause of action for Negligent Repair on the grounds it argues that it fails to
state sufficient facts to allege a cause of action for negligent repair and is
barred by the economic loss rule. 
 
Negligent Repair 
 
Economic Loss Rule 
AutoNation
argues that Plaintiff’s fifth cause of action for Negligent Repair against it
fails because it is barred by the economic loss rule. Under the economic loss rule, a plaintiff
is precluded from recovery in tort where his or her damages consist solely of
an economic loss.  (Seely v. White Motor Co. (1965) 63 Cal.2d 9,
17-18 (Seely).) “California
Courts define economic loss as ‘damages for inadequate value, costs of repair
and replacement of the defective product or consequent loss of profits—without
any claim of personal injury or damages to other property.’”  (Department
of Water & Power v. ABB Power T & D Co. (C.D.Cal. 1995) 902 F.Supp.
1178, 1186, fn. 4.)  The economic loss rule requires a purchaser to
recover in contract for purely economic loss due to disappointed expectations
unless he can demonstrate harm above and beyond a broken contractual promise. 
(Robinson Helicopter Co., Inc. v. Dana Corp. (2004) 34 Cal.4th 979, 988,
993 (Robinson) (economic loss rule prevents law of contract and law of
tort “from dissolving one into the other”).)
 
As with all negligence claims, a central question is
whether a duty is owed. In undertaking to repair the vehicle, AutoNation had a
duty to use reasonable care to avoid causing harm. However, absent physical harm,
no negligence claim is stated: “[U]nder California law, it is ‘not presumed’
that a defendant owes a duty of care to guard against economic losses
unaccompanied by injury to person or property.” (Southern California Gas
Leak Cases, supra, 7 Cal.5th 391, 397.) Stated differently, AutoNation
did not have “a tort duty to guard against negligently causing” “purely
economic loss.” (Id. at 398.) Here, because the FAC does not allege
injury to person or property, no tort duty exists. Plaintiff does not allege
any contractual relationship between Plaintiff and AutoNation; but assuming
there is one, the economic loss rule would still bar recovery. 
 
However,
there is a “recognized exception to the economic loss rule for consumers who
contract for certain kinds of professional services.”¿ (Sheen v.
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2022) 12 Cal.5th 905, 933.) 
 
Plaintiff cites to North American
Chemical Co. v. Superior Court (1991) 59 Cal.App.4th 764 to argue that the
economic loss rule does not apply to service contracts.  The economic loss rule does not limit tort
damages in actions involving (1) the quality and condition of goods where a
plaintiff is not in privity of contract and (2) cases involving the performance
of services. (North American Chemical Co. v. Superior Court (1997) 59
Cal.App.4th 781 (North American).) In both exceptions, a “plaintiff will
be entitled to recover economic loss damages without the need to allege and
prove personal injury or property damage” based on a consideration of the
factors articulated in Biakanja v. Irving (1958) 49 Cal.2d 647, 650:
“(1) the extent to which the transaction was intended to affect the plaintiff,
(2) the foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff, (3) the degree of certainty
that the plaintiff suffered injury, (4) the closeness of the connection between
the defendant’s conduct and the injury suffered, (5) the moral blame attached
to the defendant’s conduct, and (6) the policy of preventing future harm.”¿ (North
American Chemical Co. v. Superior Court (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 764, 782, 786, citing J'Aire Corp. v.
Gregory (1979) 24 Cal.3d 799, 804 (J’Aire).)  
 
The
services exception does not require that the parties are not in contractual
privity. (North
American Chemical, supra, at p.783.) However, the court
in Sheen v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (Sheen) later held that the Biakanja
factors did not apply where the parties are in contractual privity. (Sheen
at p.942 [“Therefore, on both doctrinal and pragmatic grounds, we conclude
that the Biakanja factors are not applicable when, as here, the
litigants are in contractual privity and the plaintiff's claim is not
‘independent of the contract arising from principles of tort law.’”]  Here, plaintiff alleges that Plaintiff and AutoNation are
in contractual privity.
 
Next, as in
the previous opposition to Defendant’s demurrer, Plaintiff again argues the
economic loss rule does not apply to negligent repair claims where
subcomponents of a vehicle cause damage to a larger component or where the
component causes damage to the vehicle into which it has been incorporated. (Jimenez v. Superior Court (2002) 29 Cal. 4th 473.) Jimenez
holds that a manufacturer may be strictly liable for harm resulting to other
parts of a product caused by the defective part that it manufactured. This is
sometimes referred to as the “component exception.” As noted by this Court
previously, Plaintiff has not asserted a claim for strict liability. Further,
there are no allegations that AutoNation manufactured any part, much less a
defective part that caused harm to another component part in Plaintiff’s
Vehicle.¿¿While Plaintiff does assert that AutoNation is in the business of
selling automobiles and automobile component parts (FAC, ¶ 5), Plaintiff’s
allegations against AutoNation only reference the repair aspect of AutoNation’s
business and its alleged failure to properly store, prepare, and repair the
Subject Vehicle. (FAC, ¶¶ 71, 75.) 
 
Neither party mentioned a very recent and
long-awaited California Supreme Court case that addresses the economic loss
rule, Rattagan v. Uber
Technologies, Inc. (Cal. 2024) 324 Cal.Rptr.3d
433.  In Rattagan, the Court explained
that “under the economic loss rule, tort recovery for breach of a contract duty
is generally barred  . . . unless two
conditions are satisfied. A plaintiff must first demonstrate the defendant's
injury-causing conduct violated a duty that is independent of the duties and
rights assumed by the parties when they entered the contract. Second, the
defendant's conduct must have caused injury to persons or property that was not
reasonably contemplated by the parties when the contract was formed.”  (Rattagan, supra, 324 Cal.Rptr.3d 433,
445–446.)  The Rattagan Court also
reiterated that the contract theories and law of product warranties generally regulate
the quality of the product bargained for and insulate the defendant from
liability of unlimited scope that may be alleged to arise when its product
fails to meet a customer's needs but causes no physical injuries.  (Id. at p. 447.)  The Rattagan Court discussed three illustrative
cases where an independent tort is alleged that takes the circumstances outside
of the economic rule, including (1) the price fixing retaliation alleged by
employee against former employer in Tameny
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (1980) 27 Cal.3d 167, 164, (2)
the tort of conspiring with outsiders to breach the parties contract as
discussed in Applied Equipment Corp. v. Litton Saudi Arabia Ltd. (1994)
7 Cal.4th 503, 515, and (3) the “bad faith” denial of insurance coverage, as
discussed in Freeman & Mills, Inc. v. Belcher Oil Co. (1995) 11
Cal.4th 85, 102-103.  
AutoNation argues that Plaintiff’s Fifth
Cause of Action for Negligent Repair fails because it lacks sufficient facts to
state a cause of action against AutoNation because Plaintiff has failed to
plead any facts that show that AutoNation’s conduct resulted in any damages
beyond those contemplated by the contract. 
The Court agrees, and the Court also observes that under Rattagan,
Plaintiff has failed to plead an independent tort that might fall within one of
the three factual scenarios identified by the California Suprem Court as
recognized exceptions to the economic loss rule.  
¿¿¿ 
Because the California Suprem Court’s recent
decision was certified after Plaintiff filed the FAC, the Court will invite
oral argument as to whether Plaintiff believes he can legitimately amend
consistent with the Rattagan Court’s detail discussion of the economic
loss rule and the wall of separation between tort and contract remedies.  The Court’s tentative is thus to SUSTAIN the Demurrer
and allow Plaintiff the opportunity to argue whether leave to amend should be
granted in light of the Rattagan decision.
