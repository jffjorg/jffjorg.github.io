And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion for terminating and/or monetary sanctions against the defendants. The plaintiff, Level 8 Management, Inc., seeks to strike the defendants' answer and enter default against them, or impose monetary sanctions in the amount of $4,800.00. The plaintiff argues that the defendants failed to serve supplemental discovery responses by October 11, 2024, as required by the court's order. The defendants, Nicola Di Lello a/k/a Nick Di Lello and Ital Concepts, LLC d/b/a Bottega Pizzeria Ristorante, argue that they provided supplemental responses and that the plaintiff did not meet and confer before filing the motion.

The judge finds that the plaintiff did not meet and confer with the defendants before filing the motion, as required by the court's order. The judge also finds that the defendants' supplemental responses are defective, but does not strike the answer or enter default against the defendants.

Instead, the judge awards the defendants' counsel $1,000.00 in discovery sanctions, which is reduced from the defendants' requested amount of $2,000.00. The judge also orders the plaintiff's counsel to pay the defendants' counsel $1,000.00 in discovery sanctions on or before February 28, 2025.
