     CASE NO.: 23VECV00503
 
ORDER
  DENYING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR TERMINATING AND/OR MONETARY SANCTIONS



 
I.              
BACKGROUND 
Plaintiff
Level 8 Management, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) brings a breach of contract action
against Defendants Nicola Di Lello a/k/a Nick Di Lello (“Di Lello”) and Ital
Concepts, LLC d/b/a Bottega Pizzeria Ristorante (“Bottega”) (collectively,
“Defendants”) arising out of Plaintiff’s alleged performance of professional
accounting services to assist Defendants apply for and obtain Employee
Retention Tax Credits.
On September
20, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s eight separate motions to compel
Defendants’ further discovery. 
Plaintiff now
moves for terminating sanctions and/or monetary sanctions. 
II.           
PROCEDURAL
HISTORY
On February
2, 2023, Plaintiff filed its Complaint, alleging (1) Breach of Contract and (2)
Common Counts. 
On April 6, 2023,
Plaintiff filed its First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), alleging (1) Breach of
Contract; and (2) Common Counts. 
On August 7,
2023, the court overruled Defendants’ Demurrer and denied Defendants’ Motion to
Strike.
On September 6,
2023, Defendants filed their Answer. 
On September
20, 2024, the Court denied Defendants’ Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings and
granted in part Plaintiffs’ Motions to Compel Defendants’ Further Discovery
Responses. 
On October
15, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for Terminating and/or Monetary
Sanctions (“Motion”). 
On October
23, 2024, the Court continued the non-jury trial.
On January 2,
2025, Defendants filed their Opposition. 
On January 6,
2025, Plaintiff filed its Reply. 
On January
13, 2025, Defendants filed an Objection to Plaintiff’s Reply. 
III.        
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.            
Terminating, Issue, Evidentiary, and/or
Monetary Sanctions
On motion, if
a party “fails to obey an order compelling attendance, testimony, and
production, the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction” as provided in Section 2030.010, et seq. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.450(h).)[1] The
“court, after notice to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after an
opportunity for hearing, may impose” monetary, issue, evidence, or terminating
sanctions “against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery
process[.]” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030(a)-(d).) Failing to respond or
submit to an authorized method of discovery and disobeying a court order to
provide discovery are misuses of the discovery process. (See Code
Civ. Proc. § 2023.010(d), (g).)   
IV.         
ANALYSIS
Plaintiff
requests this Court strike Defendants’ Answer and enter default against them
and/or issue monetary sanctions in the amount of $4,800.00. (See Motion,
pg. 3.) Plaintiff argues such sanctions are necessary because Defendants did
not serve supplemental discovery responses by October 11, 2024, as required by
the Court’s September 20, 2024, Order (“Order”). (See id.) 
In
opposition, Defendants argue (1) “Level 8 Management, LLC” is “an entity that
does not exist” and “any purported assignment to Plaintiff was ineffectual” and
“no contractual or other rights can be enforced in this case[]”; (2) Defendants
did provide supplemental responses; and (3) Plaintiff did not meet and
confer before filing the instant Motion as required by the Court’s Order.
(Opposition, pp. 2-8.) Defendants also request sanctions against Plaintiff in
the amount of $2,000.00. (See Declaration of Alexander Kasendorf filed
January 2, 2024 (“Kasendorf Decl.”), ¶ 13.)[2] 
In reply,
Plaintiff argues Defendants’ supplemental responses are riddled with objections
and the Court’s Order specifically requests Defendants serve supplemental
responses without objections. (See Reply, pg. 2.) Plaintiff also argues there
is no meet and confer requirement for a terminating sanctions motion. (See
id.)
Plaintiff’s
Motion is denied in its entirety for failure to meet and confer. The Court’s
Order stated “[t]hough not attached to any subsequent filings, Defendants
appear to have served supplemental responses to all eight of Plaintiff’s
discovery requests on September 5, 2024. (See, e.g., Di Lello RFPs
Opposition.) The Court will analyze each of Plaintiff’s eight motions as of the
date of filing (July 9, 2024) because the Court does not consider motions to
compel further responses moot when responses are provided after such motions
are filed unless the moving party withdraws them. Whether these supplemental
responses comply with this Court’s order here will be up to counsel to
ultimately determine.” (September 20, 2024, Order, pg. 12, fn. 3.) Plaintiff
should have analyzed whether Defendants’ September 5, 2024, supplemental
responses complied with the Court’s Order regardless of Defendants’ objections.
If not, as appears to be Plaintiff’s position, Plaintiff should have met and
conferred with Defendants about their defective supplemental responses before
filing the instant Motion. Plaintiff did not do so here.[3]
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motion is DENIED as the Court has warned counsel for failing to
meet and confer prior to filing previous motions. 
The Court
thus finds it appropriate to award Defendants’ counsel sanctions for their
efforts in opposing the Motion. Defendants request $2,000.00 in sanctions “which
amounts to the fees incurred in drafting this Opposition, reviewing Plaintiff’s
reply and attending the hearing on this Motion.” (See Kasendorf Decl., ¶
13.) Defendants do not, however, list their billing rate or hours expended to
support their sanctions request. (See id.) The Court therefore finds it
appropriate to reduce Defendants’ requested sanctions by $1,000.00, for a total
award of $1,000.00.
Plaintiff’s
counsel shall pay Defendants’ counsel $1,000.00 in discovery sanctions on or
before February 28, 2025. 
V.            
CONCLUSION
Based on the
foregoing, the Court DENIES Plaintiff’s
Motion for Terminating and/or Monetary Sanctions. 
Plaintiff’s
counsel shall pay Defendants’ counsel $1,000.00 in discovery sanctions on or
before February 28, 2025. 
IT IS SO
ORDERED.
DATED:      January 15, 2025
