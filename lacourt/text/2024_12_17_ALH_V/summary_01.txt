```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the plaintiff's motion to set aside the deemed requests for admission (RFAs) and has denied the motion. The plaintiff argues that she failed to respond to the RFAs due to inadvertence, surprise, and excusable neglect, but the court finds that she had multiple opportunities to review and respond to the RFAs and failed to do so. The court also notes that the plaintiff's failure to understand the RFAs does not constitute a valid excuse. The court concludes that the plaintiff's failure to respond to the RFAs was not caused by mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, and therefore grants the defendant's motion to deem the RFAs admitted.
