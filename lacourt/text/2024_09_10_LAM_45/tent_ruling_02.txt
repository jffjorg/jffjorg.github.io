Defendant Los Angeles Police
Department’s Demurrer
to Complaint
 
The court has
considered the moving papers. No opposition was filed.
The court SUSTAINS Defendant Los Angeles Police
Department’s demurrer to the Complaint, WITHOUT
LEAVE TO AMEND.
Background
            Plaintiff
Daimon McGuire (Plaintiff) filed this action on July 14, 2023, against Defendant
Los Angeles Police Department (Defendant) and arresting officers in booking
number 6624683. The complaint alleges that Plaintiff can no longer drive safely
in his neighborhood, because he fears officers in the 77th
department will harass him. He alleges he is a victim of discrimination. He
alleges the officers took his phone. He alleges officers arrested him for the
second time for no reason and that they have a personal vendetta against him.
            On
November 9, 2023, Defendant filed a demurrer to the Complaint.
 
Legal
Standard
When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. (Taylor v. City of Los
Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)
“A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic
matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of
the pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) “The
only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands,
unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.” (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
“[D]emurrers for uncertainty are
disfavored, and are granted only if the pleading is so incomprehensible that a
defendant cannot reasonably respond.” (Mahan
v. Charles W. Chan Ins. Agency, Inc. (2017) 14 Cal.App.5th 841, 848, fn. 3,
quoting Lickiss v. Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 1125, 1135.) “A demurrer for
uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some respects
uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery
procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly’s
California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)
Discussion
Meet
and Confer 
CCP §
430.41(a) states, in relevant part: “Before filing a demurrer . . . the
demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party
who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of
determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer.” 
CCP §
430.41(a)(2) states, in relevant part: “The parties shall meet and confer at
least five days before the date the responsive pleading is due. If the parties
are not able to meet and confer at least five days prior to the date the
responsive pleading is due, the demurring party shall be granted an automatic
30-day extension of time within which to file a responsive pleading, by filing
and serving, on or before the date on which a demurrer would be due, a
declaration stating under penalty of perjury that a good faith attempt to meet
and confer was made and explaining the reasons why the parties could not meet
and confer.” 
CCP §
430.41(a)(3) provides: “The demurring party shall file and serve with the
demurrer a declaration stating either of the following: (A) The means by which
the demurring party met and conferred with the party who filed the pleading
subject to demurrer, and that the parties did not reach an agreement resolving
the objections raised in the demurrer. (B) That the party who filed the
pleading subject to demurrer failed to respond to the meet and confer request
of the demurring party or otherwise failed to meet and confer in good faith.” 
Defendant’s counsel submits a
declaration stating that on November 9, 2023, she called Plaintiff in order to
meet and confer and determine if an agreement could be reached to resolve the
issues raised in Defendants’ Demurrer. Plaintiff did not answer so counsel left
a detailed message on his voicemail. She also emailed Plaintiff at the same
date at approximately 11:30 a.m. with the same goal. (Young Decl., ¶ 4.)
As part of the meet and confer
process, defense counsel identified the specific allegations that she believes
are subject to demurrer and identified with legal support the basis of
Defendants’ arguments. She relayed this information in her voicemail as well as
her email to Plaintiff. However, defense counsel was unable to contact
Plaintiff directly in order to reach an agreement resolving the issues raised
in Defendants’ Demurrer. (Id., ¶ 5.)
The
court finds Defendant’s counsel’s declaration is sufficient to satisfy the
meet-and-confer requirements of CCP § 430.41(a)(3)(B). The court therefore
proceeds to rule on the merits of the demurrer.
Demurrer
Defendant demurs
to the complaint on the grounds that it fails to state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action and is uncertain. (CCP §§ 430.10(e)(f).)
CRC, Rule 2.112
provides that: “Each separately stated cause of action, count, or defense must
specifically state: [¶] (1) Its number (e.g., "first cause of
action"); [¶] (2) Its nature (e.g., "for fraud"); [¶] (3) The
party asserting it if more than one party is represented on the pleading (e.g.,
"by plaintiff Jones"); and [¶] (4) The party or parties to whom it is
directed (e.g., "against defendant Smith").” “As
the leading practical treatise advises, failure to comply with [CRC 2.112]
presumably renders a complaint subject to a motion to strike (Code of Civ.
Proc., § 436), or a special demurrer for uncertainty.” (Grappo v. McMills (2017) 11 Cal.App.5th 996, 1014.)
Here, it
is unclear what causes of action are being asserted against Defendant as the
complaint fails to comply with CRC, Rule 2.112. There are no causes of
action listed against Defendant, but only incoherent allegations. Those recitals,
references to, or allegations of material facts which are left to surmise are
subject to special demurrer for uncertainty. (Bernstein v. Piller (1950)
98 Cal.App.2d 441, 443-444.) Thus, the complaint is subject to
demurrer for uncertainty.
In addition, the complaint fails
to state a cause of action against Defendant because it does not identify any
statutory basis to assert a cause of action against a public entity such as
Defendant.
Under the Government Claims
Act, “[a] public entity is not liable for an injury . . .” [e]xcept as
otherwise provided by statute . . ..”¿ (Gov. Code, section 815;¿State ex
rel. Department of California Highway Patrol v. Superior Court¿(2015) 60
Cal.4th¿1002, 1009.) A plaintiff claiming direct tort liability against a
public entity must identify a specific statute declaring the entity to be
liable, or at least creating some specific duty of care by the agency in favor
of the injured party, and not on the general tort provisions of Code Civ.
Proc., section 1714. (de Villers v. County of San Diego (2007) 156
Cal.App.4th 238, 252.) 
 
Because all liability under the Government Claims
Act is statutory, “the general rule that statutory causes of action must be
pleaded with particularity is applicable.”¿(Susman¿v. City of Los Angeles¿(1969)
269 Cal.App.2d 803, 809.)¿Thus, “to state a cause of action every fact
essential to the existence of statutory liability must be pleaded with
particularity, including the existence of a statutory duty.”¿(Searcy v.
Hemet Unified School District¿(1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 792, 802.) 
 
As noted above, there is no statutory
basis identified in the complaint. As such, the complaint is subject to
demurrer on this ground as well.
 
Moreover, Gov. Code §¿821.6 provides, “A public employee is not
liable for injury caused by his instituting or prosecuting any judicial or
administrative proceeding within the scope of his employment, even if he acts
maliciously and without probable cause.”  The court in Blackburn v.
County of Los Angeles (1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 175, 178 held a criminal
investigation fell within the protection of Section 821.6: “'When the duty to
investigate crime and to institute criminal proceedings is lodged with any
public officer, it is for the best interests of the community as a whole that
[the officer] be protected from harassment in the performance of that
duty.”  It appears this section applies in this case to the extent that
Plaintiff is criticizing the investigation and subsequent prosecution of his
arrest.  (See also Johnson v. City of Pacifica (1970) 4 Cal.App.3d
82, 85-86.)
 
      Lastly,
although Plaintiff has named the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) as a
defendant in this action, the LAPD cannot be sued in state court because it
does not exist separate and apart from the City of Los Angeles, and thus, the
LAPD does not have its own legal identity. (See Alcala v. City of Corcoran (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 666, 669-71.) Defendant avers that a lawsuit against the LAPD
is tantamount to a lawsuit against the City of Los Angeles. Plaintiff does not
dispute this assertion or otherwise provide any explanation for why he can sue
LAPD separately from the City. Thus, LAPD is not a properly named defendant in
this matter.  
 
Accordingly, based on the
foregoing independent reasons, Defendant’s demurrer is SUSTAINED.  
 
Because there is no argument
by Plaintiff showing that these defects can be cured, there is no reasonable
probability of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18
Cal.3d 335, 347.)  The court therefore will
not allow leave to amend.
 
 Defendant’s demurrer is SUSTAINED without leave to
amend.   
It is so
ordered.
