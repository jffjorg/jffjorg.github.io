  - "Whether a tenant vacated leased premises within a reasonable period of time after the landlord's initial disturbance of the tenant's possession is generally a question of fact for a jury and cannot be decided on a demurrer."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in which they overrule the defendants' demurrer to the fifth cause of action in the plaintiffs' first amended complaint, which is for constructive eviction. The case arises from the plaintiffs' tenancy at a property in Los Angeles, California, from July 1, 2017 to February 28, 2023. The plaintiffs allege that they were constructively evicted from the property and vacated the premises. The defendants argue that the plaintiffs did not vacate the property within a reasonable time and therefore their claim for constructive eviction fails as a matter of law. The judge disagrees and finds that whether the plaintiffs vacated the premises within a reasonable time is a question of fact for the jury and cannot be decided on a demurrer. The judge also finds that the defendants are responsible for the disturbances that caused the constructive eviction, even if some of the disturbances were caused by other tenants. Finally, the judge finds that whether some of the disturbances are substantial enough to support a claim for constructive eviction is also a question of fact for the jury.
