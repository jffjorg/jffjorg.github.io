And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion for complete consolidation of cases 22PSCV01733, 24PSCV01045, and 24PSCV01099. The consolidation is effective upon filing the motion in case No. 24PSCV01099. The three cases arise from the same motor vehicle accident that occurred on April 25, 2022, and involve common questions of law and fact. The judge has weighed the factors relevant to consolidation, including timeliness, complexity, and prejudice, and has determined that consolidation is necessary to avoid unnecessary costs or delay, avoid duplication of procedure, and avoid inconsistent results. The judge has also considered the fact that the plaintiff has not objected to the consolidation and has filed a notice of non-opposition to the motion.
