DEFENDANTS, LDI MECHANICAL INC. AND CARLOS HUERTA’S
NOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION FOR COMPLETE CONSOLIDATION OF CASES 22PSCV01733,
24PSCV01045 AND 24PSCV01099 is GRANTED; effective upon filing the motion in
case No. 24PSCV01099. 
 
Background
 
This case arises from a motor vehicle accident that happened
on 4/25/2022. 
 
On November 8, 2022, Plaintiff Natasha Khoj Shikari filed
her action against Defendants LDI Mechanical Inc.; Carlos Huerta for (1) motor
vehicle.
 
On December 7, 2022, Defendants each filed their respective
answers.
 
On April 15, 2024, the court issued its ruling re: Notice of
Related case and found that “that the following cases, 22PSCV01733 and
24PSCV01045, are related within the meaning of California Rules of Court, rule
3.300(a). 22PSCV01733 is the lead case.”
 
On May 29, 2024, Defendants filed the instant motion.
 
On June 21, 2024, Plaintiff filed a notice of non-opposition
to the motion. According to the motion, Plaintiff requests “that the Motion to
Consolidate be granted in its entirety.” (Motion p. 2:1-2.) 
 
Legal Standard
 
California Rules of
Court, rule 3.350(1) requires a consolidation motion notice to: (A) list all named parties
in each case, the names of those who have appeared, and the names of their
respective attorneys of record; (B) contain the captions of all the cases
sought to be consolidated, with the lowest numbered case shown first; and (C) be
filed in each case sought to be consolidated.
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 1048 grants discretion to the trial courts to consolidate
actions involving common questions of law or fact.  The trial court’s decision will not be
disturbed on appeal absent a clear showing of abuse of discretion.  A consolidation of actions does not affect
the rights of the parties.  The purpose
of consolidation is to avoid unnecessary costs or delay, avoid duplication of
procedure, particularly in the proof of issues common to both actions, and
avoid inconsistent results by hearing and deciding common issues together.  (See
Estate of Baker (1982) 131 Cal.App.3d
471, 485.)   “Consolidation is not a
matter of right; it rests solely within the sound discretion of the trial
judge, and his decision to consolidate, or his refusal to do so, will not be
reviewed except upon a clear showing of abuse of discretion.” (Fisher v. Nash Building Co. (1952) 113
Cal.App.2d 397, 402.)
 
Each case presents
its own facts and circumstances, but the court generally considers the
following: (1) timeliness of the motion: i.e., whether granting consolidation
would delay the trial of any of the cases involved; (2) complexity: i.e.,
whether joining the actions involved would make the trial too confusing or
complex for a jury; and (3) prejudice: i.e, whether consolidation would
adversely affect the rights of any party. 
(See State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1956) 47 Cal.2d
428, 430–431.)  In deciding whether to
grant a motion to consolidate, the court should weigh whether the common issues
predominate over the individual issues and whether any risks of jury confusion
or prejudice to the parties outweighs the reduction in time and expense that
would result from consolidation.  (Todd-Stenberg v. Shield (1996) 48
Cal.App.4th 976, 978.)
 
Discussion
 
Here, the three actions are based on the same car accident that
happened on April 5, 2022, past the intersection of Fairplex Drive and Avalon
Avenue in Pomona, California wherein Defendant Huerta’s vehicle impacted
Plaintiff Shikari’s vehicle. Plaintiff Shikari’s vehicle then impacted
Plaintiff Angel Gonzalez’s vehicle, and Plaintiff Angel Gonzalez’s vehicle
struck Plaintiff Aguilar’s vehicle. With the same or overlapping issues (based
in negligence), the actions should be consolidated and disposed of as a single
proceeding. (Motion p. 7, citing Spector v. Superior Court of San Mateo
County (1961) 55 Cal. 2d 839, 844.) 
 
Though Defense Counsel maintains otherwise (Motion p. 11 of
74, Gavigan Decl.), the motion has not been filed in case No. 24PSCV01099. Notwithstanding,
the POS indicates that Plaintiff Livier Aguilar has been served with notice of
and the motion (Motion p. 74 of 74 of PDF), which mitigates any concerns with
the statutorily required 16 court days’ notice a motion. (CCP section 1005(b).)

 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the motion is granted, effective
upon filing the motion in case 24PSCV01099.
