And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The plaintiff, White Avenue Plaza, LLC, filed a lawsuit against Reyna Mejina, Jimmy Blaney, and Edward Echenique for breach of a rental agreement. The court denied the plaintiff's application for entry of default judgment against Reyna and Edward for three reasons. First, the lease only bears Reyna's name, making it unclear how Edward bears liability. Second, the plaintiff failed to comply with CCP ยง 585, which requires dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought. Third, the plaintiff's claim for demolition costs is unsupported. The court seeks clarification and/or further evidence of the demolition costs. The default judgment is denied without prejudice.
