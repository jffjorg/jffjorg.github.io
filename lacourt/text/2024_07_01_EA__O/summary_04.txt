```

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Plaintiff's Application for Entry of Default Judgment is denied without prejudice for three reasons. The reasons are: 1) the lease only bears Reyna's name, making it unclear how Edward bears liability in this action; 2) the Plaintiff has not complied with CCP section 585, which requires dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought and a showing of grounds for each judgment; and 3) the Plaintiff seeks $23,500 in demolition costs, but the actual amount is only $11,700. The Judge seeks clarification and/or further evidence of the demolition costs. The default judgment is denied without prejudice, meaning the Plaintiff may re-file the application after addressing these defects.
