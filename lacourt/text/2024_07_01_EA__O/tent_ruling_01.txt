  Case Number:  21PSCV00443    Hearing Date:   July 1, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
Cross-Defendants’ Demurrer is SUSTAINED
in its entirety with leave to amend as the FACC requires clearer
allegations. 
 
Background
 
This
is a defamation case. Plaintiffs USA Tour Line, Inc. and Yunshe Shi 
(collectively, “Plaintiffs”) allege the following against
Defendant Shengli Zhang (“Defendant”): On March 4, 2021, Defendant was hired as
a forklift driver and part of his contract was to produce evidence of a
forklift operating license On March 6, 2021, Defendant was injured while at
work. “Defendant attempted to extort the sum of $30,000 from the plaintiffs in
order [to] not make a worker's compensation claim.” When Plaintiffs refused to
pay, Defendant published defamatory statements on chineseinla.com, which has
“caused the visitors to Plaintiffs site to drop from a 1000 per day.”
Plaintiffs allege that they have been damaged in the amount of $500,000.00.
 
On
May 28, 2021, Plaintiffs filed suit against Defendant for:1.     Breach of Contract2.     Fraud and3.     Intentional Tort
 
On
September 7, 2021, Defendant filed his Answer. That same day, Defendant filed a
Cross
Complaint
(“CC”) against Plaintiffs against for:1.     Negligence2.     Wrongful Termination3.     Fraud4.     Intentional Infliction of Emotional
Distress and5.     Negligent Infliction of Emotional
Distress
 
On September 22, 2022, the court denied Defendant’s
further discovery motion and imposed monetary sanctions on Defendant and its
counsel. 


On April 10, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Attorney
Fees. 
 
On June 9, 2023, the court learned that sanctions were
paid to the court, thus rendering any motion moot. 
 
On February 1, 2024, the courts
attended an MSC, but no settlement was reached. 
 
On February 20, 2024, Plaintiffs filed
a notice of substitution of attorney (Ray Hsu now represents Plaintiffs).
 
On February 21, 2024, Defendant filed
an amendment to cross-complaint (CC) naming Kong Miaomiao (“Kong”) as Doe 1. 
 
On April 5, 2024, Kong filed his
answer to the CC.
 
On April 19, 2024, Defendant filed an
amended CC (“FACC”) (reasserting the same 5 COAs against the Plaintiffs and
Kong).
 
On May 9, 2024, Plaintiffs and Kong
(collectively, “moving parties”) filed a demurrer to the FACC. 
 
On May 28, 2024, Defendant filed his
opposition.
 
On June 20, 2024, moving parties filed
the reply. 
 
Discussion
The Moving parties demur to the FACC’s 2nd 
COA for Wrongful Termination, 3rd COA for Fraud, 4th  COA
for Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED), and 5th COA
for Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress (NIED).[1]

For reasons to be
discussed below, the FACC is somewhat unclear; therefore, the entirety of the
demurrer is sustained with leave to amend. Before engaging in the merits of each COA, the court
provides a general overview of the relevant allegations in the FACC. 
The FACC alleges that Defendant began working for USA
Tour on March 4, 2021 as an intern making $15/hour. (FACC ¶7.) Two days into
the job, Defendant was injured while operating a forklift. (¶13.) On or about
March 30, 2021, Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Shi represented to Defendant that
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant UTL obtained insurance for work-related injuries, but
Shi dissuaded Defendant from filing a claim, citing fears that his insurance
premiums would increase substantially. (¶17.) Defendant reasserted his desire
to file a claim. On April 6, 2021, Plaintiff Shi notified Defendant that he was
terminated for not provided a proof of his forklift operating license/prior
experience (¶22), even though upon hire he was informed that he did not need a
license nor experience (¶13.) On April 20, 2021, Defendant posted on various
sites in search of a new lawyer to which Plaintiffs responded by filing the
instant action. (¶25.) 
2nd COA: Wrongful Termination 
A claim for wrongful termination in violation of public
policy must be based on a public policy articulated in state statute, federal
statute, regulations, or the California Constitution. (Gantt v. Sentry Ins.,
(1992)1 Cal. 4th 1083, 1095.) 
Here, both parties
discuss Labor Code section 1102.5 and 132a in relation to the 2nd COA,
but the 2nd COA makes no reference to 132a,
only Labor Code 1102.5. On a demurrer, the facts must be found in the four
corners of the complaint, not the parties’ papers. (See Melikian v. Truck
Ins. Exchange (1955) 133 Cal.App.2d 113, 114 [“In approaching that issue we are bound, just as the trial court was
bound, by the allegations in the verified complaint and cannot consider the
outré-judicial statements of counsel nor the additional facts found in the
briefs.”].) 
 
Therefore, the demurrer is sustained on the grounds of
uncertainty with leave to amend. With that, at this juncture, the court will
not address the parties’ arguments relating to this COA such as whether an
action for wrongful termination can only be asserted against an employer or
whether the WCAB is the exclusive jurisdiction for Labor Code § 132(a)
violations. 
3rd COA: Fraud 
A complaint for fraud must allege the following elements:
(1) a knowingly false representation by the defendant; (2) an intent to deceive
or induce reliance; (3) justifiable reliance by the plaintiff, and (4)
resulting damages. Every element must be specifically pleaded. (Service by
Medallion, Inc. v. Clorox Co., (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1807, 1816).
Here, it is
unclear what representation the fraud COA is based on. On the one hand, Plaintiff asserts
that the purported representation is that he need not have been licensed to
operate the forklift (¶54) but in the same COA he alleges that the purported
misrepresentation is that Plaintiffs represented that they had insurance for
work-related injuries, when they in fact did not. (¶51.) Aside from the fact
that the “what” (i.e., statement that was a misrepresentation) is not clearly
pled, the pleading also does not provide ultimate facts about justifiable
reliance. (Demurrer p. 9.) Though the opposition largely recites allegations in
the complaint and provides case law, it does not squarely address the fact that
the FACC does not assert the 3rd element of justifiable
reliance.
Therefore, the court SUSTAINS the demurrer with leave to
amend.
4th COA and 5th COA: IIED and NIED,
respectively (consolidated analysis by the parties) 
As for both the 4th and 5th COAs,
The FACC alleges that “Defendant/Cross-Complainant Zhang refused to settle his
injury claim privately and insisted on utilizing USA Tour Line's worker's
compensation insurance, Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Shi yelled at
Defendant/Cross-Complainant Zhang, accused him of 'blackmail,' and threatened
to report Zhang to immigration authorities. This conduct was outrageous and
intended to cause Defendant/Cross-Complainant Zhang severe emotional distress.”
(¶59, emphasis added.)
Defendants argue this doesn’t
rise to the level of outrageousness required for IIED and Plaintiffs maintain
otherwise. Neither party has provided a meaningful analysis. To the extent that
Defendant argues these COAs are within the WCAB’s purview, that argument is
improperly raised for the first time in reply. (Jay v. Mahaffey (2013)
218 Cal.App.4th 1522, 1537-1538.) 
Therefore, the court SUSTAINS the demurrer on the 4th
and 5th COAs and requests the parties on a subsequent demurrer, if
filed, to provide an analysis as to the issue.[2]
 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, as the FACC could use some
clarification, the court sustains the demurrer with leave to amend.
