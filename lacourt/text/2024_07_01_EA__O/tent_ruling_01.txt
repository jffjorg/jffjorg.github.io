  Case Number:  22PSCV02996    Hearing Date:   July 1, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
Plaintiff’s Application for Entry of Default Judgment is DENIED
without prejudice for three reasons [see infra]. 
 
Background
 
This case arises from the breach of a rental agreement.
 
On December 20, 2022, Plaintiff White Avenue Plaza, LLC
filed suit against Defendants REYNA MEJINA also known as REYNA MEJIA (“Reyna”);
JIMMY BLANEY (“Blaney”); and EDWARD ECHENIQUE (“Edward”) for damages (arising
from failure to pay monthly rent and Plaintiff’s incurred fees and fines from
Defendants’ alleged illegal and unlicensed activity on the property).[1] 
 
On August 29, 2023, default was entered against Edward. 
 
On November 30, 2023, default was entered against Reyna. 
 
On February 27, 2024, Edward filed a motion to set aside
default.[2]
 
On March 11, 2024, Blaney filed his answer. 
 
On May 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant application for
entry of default judgment. 
 
On May 9, 2024, the court denied without prejudice Edward’s
motion (due to the failure to explain his negligence in failing to
timely file an answer).
 
 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff seeks entry of default judgment against Defendants
Reyna and Edward in the total amount of $78,872.68, which includes $61,674.00
in damages and $13,362.70 in interest.[3] 
 
The application is denied for three reasons. 
 
First,
the lease only bears Reyna’s name. Thus, it is unclear how Edward
bears liability in this action.
 
Second, according
to CCP section 585, entry of default judgment requires dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is
not sought (including doe defendants) and a dismissal of all parties against
whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment under CCP §
579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment. Plaintiff has
not complied with the foregoing (namely as Blaney has filed an answer and
judgment is not sought against him). 
 
Third, Plaintiff seeks $23,500 in demolition costs and
references Exhibits 5 and 6 to support said costs. However, the checks are in
the amounts of $699.91 + $5,000 + $6,000, that does not amount to $23,500 but
about $11,700. Therefore,
the court seeks clarification and/or further evidence of the demolition costs.

 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing three defects, the default judgment
is denied without prejudice.
