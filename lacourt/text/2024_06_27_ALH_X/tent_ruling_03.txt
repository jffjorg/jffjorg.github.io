RELIEF
REQUESTED 
 
             Plaintiff applies for a writ of
possession for two excavators and a hydraulic breaker.
 
BACKGROUND
 
             This case arises out of Plaintiff John Deere
Construction & Forestry Company’s (“Plaintiff”) claim that Defendant Esmeralda
Ramirez Arellano (“Defendant”) failed to make payments pursuant to two
contracts for the sale of a new John Deere 60G Compact Excavator (ID# 1FF060GXCMJ294075)
(“Subject Equipment No. 1”), a used Hitachi ZX85-5 Hydraulic Excavator (ID# HCMDEF60P00022693)
(“Subject Equipment No. 2”), and a new Furukawa FX55 Hydraulic Breaker (ID# #X55-11837) (“Subject Equipment
No. 3”) (collectively the “Equipment”). Plaintiff filed this complaint on December
21, 2023, alleging two causes of action for (1) breach of contract and (3)
claim and delivery. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            Plaintiff’s
application for writ of possession is tentatively GRANTED upon Plaintiff
demonstrating probable validity of its claims of possession.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
            “Upon the filing of the complaint or
at any time thereafter, the plaintiff may apply pursuant to this chapter for a
writ of possession by filing a written application for the writ with the court
in which the action is brought.” (Code Civ. Proc. section 512.010, subd. (a).) 
 
“The application shall be executed
under oath and shall include all of the following: [¶] (1) A showing of the basis of the
plaintiff’s claim and that the plaintiff is entitled to possession of the
property claimed. If the basis of the plaintiff’s claim is a written
instrument, a copy of the instrument shall be attached. [¶] (2) A showing that the
property is wrongfully detained by the defendant, of the manner in which the
defendant came into possession of the property, and, according to the best
knowledge, information, and belief of the plaintiff, of the reason for the
detention. [¶] (3) A
particular description of the property and a statement of its value. [¶] (4) A statement,
according to the best knowledge, information, and belief of the plaintiff, of
the location of the property and, if the property, or some part of it, is
within a private place which may have to be entered to take possession, a showing
that there is probable cause to believe that such property is located there. [¶] (5) A statement that the
property has not been taken for a tax, assessment, or fine, pursuant to a
statute; or seized under an execution against the property of the plaintiff;
or, if so seized, that it is by statute exempt from such seizure.” (Code Civ.
Proc. section 512.010, subd. (b).)
 
            “Prior to the hearing required by
subdivision (a) of Section 512.020, the defendant shall be served with all of
the following: [¶] (1) A
copy of the summons and complaint. [¶] (2) A Notice of Application and Hearing. [¶] (3) A copy of the
application and any affidavit in support thereof.” (Code Civ. Proc. section
512.030, subd. (a).)
 
DISCUSSION
 
             Requirements
of Code of Civil Procedure Section 512.010
            
            Plaintiff provides that the basis of its claim are two
separate contracts. Plaintiff provides that on August 25, 2021, Defendant
entered into a contract to purchase Subject Equipment No. 1 for $86,221.25. (Ross
Decl. ¶ 4.A.) Plaintiff provides that on May 6, 2021, Defendant entered into a
contract to purchase Subject Equipment No. 2 and Subject Equipment No. 3 for $134,093.00.
(Id. ¶ 4.B.) Plaintiff provides that pursuant to the contracts, it had a
security interest for the Equipment
which was perfected by filing UCC-1 financing statements with the California
Secretary of State. (Id. ¶ 5.) Plaintiff also provides that the
contracts contain acceleration clauses. (Id. ¶ 6.) Plaintiff provides
Defendant failed to make timely payments on the contracts. (Id. ¶ 7.) Plaintiff provides that an unpaid
balance of $204,615.41 remain on the combined balance of the Equipment. (Id. ¶ 4.) Plaintiff
provides that the current wholesale value of the Equipment is $185,336.00. (Id. ¶ 8.) Plaintiff provides that Defendant acquired possession
of the Subject Vehicles by purchase for business purposes. (Id. ¶ 10.)  Plaintiff
provides that the location for the Equipment
is 396 W. Montana St., Pasadena, CA 91103. (Dunning Decl., ¶ 4, Application
¶ 6.) Plaintiff also provides that the property has
not been taken for a tax, assessment, or fine nor has it been seized under
execution against Plaintiff’s property. (Application, ¶ 8.) 
 
            Plaintiff has complied with the requirements of Code of
Civil Procedure section 512.010. 
 
Issues at Hearing
 
            “At the hearing, a writ of
possession shall issue if both of the following are found: [¶] (1) The plaintiff has
established the probable validity of the plaintiff’s claim to possession of the
property. [¶] (2) The
undertaking requirements of Section 515.010 are satisfied.” (Code Civ. Proc.
section 512.060.)
 
            “If the court finds that the defendant has no interest in the property,
the court shall waive the requirement of the plaintiff's undertaking and shall
include in the order for issuance of the writ the amount of the defendant's
undertaking sufficient to satisfy the requirements of subdivision (b) of Section 515.020.” (Code Civ. Proc. section 515.010,
subd. (b).
            
            Plaintiff
argues that no undertaking should be required because the wholesale value of
the Equipment is $185,336.00 (Ross Decl. ¶ 8) while the sum owed by Defendant is $204,615.41 (id. ¶ 4).
Thus, no undertaking is required in the present case. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Plaintiff’s
application for writ of possession is tentatively GRANTED upon Plaintiff
demonstrating probable validity of its claims of possession.
