Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in favor of the plaintiff, John Deere Construction & Forestry Company, granting its application for a writ of possession for two excavators and a hydraulic breaker. The plaintiff claims that the defendant, Esmeralda Ramirez Arellano, failed to make payments on two contracts for the sale of the equipment. The judge found that the plaintiff has demonstrated probable validity of its claims of possession and that the defendant has no interest in the property. The judge also waived the requirement for the plaintiff's undertaking, as the wholesale value of the equipment is greater than the sum owed by the defendant. The hearing date is set for June 27, 2024.
