**Tentative Ruling**

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Financial Partners Credit Union v. Augusto Javier Inchizu, Case No. 23NWCV02728. The Court has granted the Plaintiff's motion to deem the Requests for Admissions (Set One) admitted.

**Background**

This is a debt collection action filed by Financial Partners Credit Union against Augusto Javier Inchizu, alleging that the parties entered into a loan and security agreement and a disclosure statement on December 13, 2021. The Defendant allegedly defaulted on the loan, leaving a remaining balance of $28,420.22 due and payable.

**Legal Standard**

Under California Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, when a party fails to respond to a request for admission, the propounding party may move for an order deeming the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests to be admitted.

**Discussion**

The Plaintiff served the Request for Admissions (Set One) on the Defendant on November 17, 2023, and the responses were due on December 23, 2023. However, the Defendant failed to respond, and the Plaintiff's counsel sent a meet and confer letter on January 3, 2024, but received no response. As a result, the truth of the matters in the Request for Admissions is deemed admitted.

**Conclusion**

The Court grants the Plaintiff's motion to deem Request for Admissions (Set One) admitted.
