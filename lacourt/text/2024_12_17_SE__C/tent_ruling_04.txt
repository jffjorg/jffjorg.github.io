On August 30, 2023, Plaintiff  Financial Partners Credit Union (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Augusto  Javier Inchizu aka Augusto Javier Arvizu aka Arvizu Augusto (“Defendant”) and  Does 1 to 50. The Complaint alleges the parties entered into Loan and Security  Agreements and a Disclosure Statement (“Agreement”) on December 13, 2021. On or  around February 6, 2023, Defendant allegedly defaulted on the loan, in which  there was a remaining balance of $28,420.22 due and payable. Plaintiff seeks  the balance due, interest, and attorneys’ fees and costs as provided by the  Agreement.   Plaintiff now moves to deem the Requests for Admissions (Set  One) admitted. The motion is unopposed as of December 13, 2024.    Legal Standard   Where there has been no timely response to a request for  admission under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party  may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of  any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted. (Code of Civ. Proc.,  § 2033.280, subd. (b).) The court “shall” grant a motion to deem admitted  requests for admissions, “unless it finds that the party to whom the requests  for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion,  a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial  compliance with Section 2033.220.”¿ (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.  (c).)¿¿   Discussion   On November 17, 2023, Plaintiff served a Request for  Admissions (Set One) on Defendant. (Elder Decl., ¶ 5, Exh. 1.) The responses  were due on December 23, 2023. (Elder Decl., ¶ 6.) On January 3, 2024,  Plaintiff’s counsel set a meet and confer letter to Defendant regarding the  overdue responses, but counsel received no response. (Elder Decl., ¶ 7, Exh.  2.)    Given that Defendant has not responded to the Request for  Admissions, the truth of the matters in the Request are deemed admitted. The  Court grants the Motion to Deem Request for Admissions (Set One) Admitted.
