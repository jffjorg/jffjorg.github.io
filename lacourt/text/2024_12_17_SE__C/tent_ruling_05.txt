 Case Number:  23NWCV03464    Hearing Date:   December 17, 2024    Dept:  C SOTO v. FORD MOTOR  COMPANY ET AL. CASE NO.: 23NWCV03464 HEARING:  December 17,  2024 @ 9:30 a.m.JUDGE: RAUL A. SAHAGUN   #3 TENTATIVE ORDER   Plaintiff Francisco  Soto’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production, Set Two  is CONTINUED to April 22, 2025 in Department SE-C at 10:30 a.m.    Plaintiff to give  notice.    Background   This is a lemon law action. On October 27, 2023, Plaintiff  Francisco Soto (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Ford Motor Company (“Defendant”),  Ken Grody Ford, and Does 1 to 10. On August 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed the First  Amended Complaint (FAC). Plaintiff contends that Defendant violated the  California Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (“Song-Beverly Act”) by failing repair  or replace Plaintiff’s 2019 Ford Ranger (“Subject Vehicle”). During the  warranty period, the Subject Vehicle contained or developed defects, including  transmission defects, that Defendant’s authorized repair facility was unable to  conform to warranty.    On December 12, 2023, Plaintiff propounded the Requests for  Production of Documents, Set One, on Defendant (“Requests”). (Smith Decl., ¶  17, Exh. 5; Moawad Decl., ¶ 2.) On January 16, 2024, Defendant served its  responses and objections to the Requests. (Smith Decl., ¶ 20-21, Exh. 6; Moawad  Decl., ¶ 2, Exh. A.)    Plaintiff now moves to compel further responses to Requests  for Production, Set Two.    Legal Standard   CCP Section 2031.310 allows a party who has requested  production of documents and received unsatisfactory responses to move for an  order compelling further responses. A motion under this section must (1) set  forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the  demand and (2) be accompanied by a meet and confer showing “a reasonable and  good faith attempt” to resolve the issues outside of court. (Code Civ. Proc., §  2031.310, subd. (b)(2).) Evidentiary Objections   The Court overrules Plaintiff’s evidentiary objections to  certain paragraphs contained in the Declarations of Jodi Schebel and Kevin  Payne.    Discussion             Timeliness   “Unless notice of this motion [to compel further] is given  within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental  verified response, or on or before any specific later date to which the demanding  party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the demanding party  waives any right to compel a further response to the demand.” (Code Civ. Proc.  § 2031.310, subd. (c).) Failure to make motion within the specified period  constitutes waiver of right to compel a further response. (Sexton v.  Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal. App. 4th 1403, 1410 (finding a late filed  motion to compel further must be denied even if omitted in opposition papers).)   The Court finds the Motion was timely filed. Defendant  served its responses and objections to the Requests on January 16, 2024. (Smith  Decl., ¶¶  20-21, Exh. 6; Moawad Decl., ¶  2, Exh. A.) Defendant verified its responses on February 24, 2024. (Moawad  Decl., ¶ 2, Exh. A.) This Motion was filed on March 11, 2024. The 45-day clock  runs only upon service of verified responses, and responses consisting of both  factual responses and objections must be verified. (Golf & Tennis Pro  Shop, Inc. v. Super. Ct. (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 127, 136.) This Motion was  filed 17 days after verifications were given, and thus, the Motion is timely.    Meet and Confer   “The Discovery Act requires that, prior to the initiation of  a motion to compel, the moving party declare that he or she has made a serious  attempt to obtain ‘an informal resolution of each issue.’ [Citations.] This  rule is designed ‘to encourage the parties to work out their differences  informally so as to avoid the necessity for a formal order. . .’ [Citations.]  This, in turn, will lessen the burden on the court and reduce the unnecessary  expenditure of resources by litigants through promotion of informal,  extrajudicial resolution of discovery disputes. . .[T]he law requires that  counsel attempt to talk the matter over, compare their views, consult, and  deliberate.” (Townsend v. Superior Court (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 1431,  1435, 1439.)   On December 12, 2024, Plaintiff attempted to meet and confer  regarding establishing a protocol for the discovery of electronically stored  information (ESI). (Smith Decl., ¶ 26, Exh. 7.) On January 16, 2024, Defendant  responded to the letter indicating broad discovery of ESI was not appropriate  or proportional in this case but offered to meet and confer further on the  issue. (Smith Decl., ¶ 27, Exh. 8.) On January 30, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel  sent Defendant’s counsel a meet and confer letter regarding demanding Defendant  supplement all 88 requests for production and multiple special interrogatories,  and reiterating its position on ESI discovery. (Smith Decl., ¶ 28, Exh. 9;  Moawad Decl., ¶ 3, Exh. B.) On February 20, 2024, Defendant responded with its  own meet and confer letter, reiterating its objections and agreeing to  supplement six responses (Nos. 23, 27-30, and 32). (Smith Decl., ¶ 29, Exh. 10;  Moawad Decl., ¶ 4, Exh. C.) On March 8, 2024, Plaintiff sent a meet and confer  email, dismissing Defendant’s offer to supplement its six responses and again  demanding responses to all requests for production. (Smith Decl., ¶ 30, Exh. 11;  Moawad Decl., ¶ 4, Exh. D.) Plaintiff filed this Motion three days later.   The Court is not persuaded that counsel have exhausted their  meet and confer obligations pursuant to the Code. The Court finds that the meet  and confer efforts have been insufficient considering the number of outstanding  discovery requests—specifically, 25 requests—at issue in the instant motion. Merely  stating one’s position in a meet and confer letter does not equate to meaningful  deliberation of issues.    Therefore, counsel is ordered to make further efforts to  resolve the issues presented, including the issue of discovery of ESI. If,  after exhausting those efforts, court intervention is needed, counsel may  appear and argue the merits on the continued hearing date. If counsel is unable  to informally resolve their discovery disputes, then counsel is instructed to  submit a joint separate statement with a detailed outline of the remaining  disputed issues for which a ruling is required. Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel  Further Responses to Requests for Production, Set Two is CONTINUED to April 22,  2025 in Department SE-C at 10:30 a.m. The joint separate statement must be filed  on or before April 15, 2025.
