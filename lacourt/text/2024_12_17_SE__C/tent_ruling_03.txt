TENTATIVE ORDER
 
Plaintiff Sandra
Garcia’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Request for Production of
Documents, Set Two, is CONTINUED to April 8, 2025 in Department SE-C at 10:30
a.m. 
 
Plaintiff to give
notice. 
 
Background
 
This is a lemon law action. On July 7, 2023, Plaintiff
Sandra Garcia (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendant American Honda
Corporation, Inc. (“Defendant”). Plaintiff contends that Defendant violated the
California Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (“Song-Beverly Act”) by failing
to repair or replace Plaintiff’s 2022 Acura MDX (“Subject Vehicle”). During the
warranty period, the Subject Vehicle contained or developed numerous defects
that Defendant’s authorized repair facility was unable to conform to
warranty. 
 
On December 26, 2023, Plaintiff propounded the Request for
Production of Documents, Set Two, Nos. 1 to 101, on Defendant (“Requests”). (Grigoryan
Decl. ¶ 19, Exh. 3; Moody Decl. ¶ 7, Exh. C.) On January 30, 2024, Defendant
served responses containing objections to Plaintiff’s Requests. (Grigoryan
Decl. ¶  20, Exh 4; Moody Decl. ¶ 8, Exh.
D.) 
 
Plaintiff now moves to compel further responses to Requests
for Production, set Two. Defendant opposes the Motion. No reply has been filed
as of December 13, 2024.
 
Legal Standard
 
CCP Section 2031.310 allows a party who has requested
production of documents and received unsatisfactory responses to move for an
order compelling further responses. A motion under this section must (1) set
forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the
demand and (2) be accompanied by a meet and confer showing “a reasonable and
good faith attempt” to resolve the issues outside of court. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (b)(2).) 
 
Discussion
 
Timeliness
 
“Unless notice of this motion [to compel further] is given
within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental
verified response, or on or before any specific later date to which the
demanding party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the demanding
party waives any right to compel a further response to the demand.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2031.310, subd. (c).) Failure to make motion within the specified
period constitutes waiver of right to compel a further response. (Sexton
v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal. App. 4th 1403, 1410 (finding a late filed
motion to compel further must be denied even if omitted in opposition papers).)
 
This Motion was filed on April 15, 2024. The Court finds
that the issue of whether the Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests
for Production, set Two, Nos. 1 to 101, was timely filed depends on when or
whether Defendant served verified supplemental responses. (Opp., p. 3, lines 7-10.)
On January 30, 2024, Defendant served its initial responses to Plaintiff’s
Requests. (Grigoryan Decl. ¶  20, Exh 4;
Moody Decl. ¶ 8, Exh. D.) In the opposition, Defendant states it “served its
document production” in response to the Requests on March 12, 2024, although it
cites to paragraph 10 of the “Vault Declaration” where there is no such declaration.
(Opp., p. 3, line 7.) The Court notes the attached “Moody Declaration” states
that Defendant served its document production in response to the Requests on
December 4, 2024. (Vault Decl., ¶ 9.) Plaintiff’s Motion did not mention any
supplemental responses. 
 
The Court notes that if Defendant served supplemental verified
responses on March 12, 2024, this Motion to Compel Further would be timely—it
would have been filed 35 days after responses were filed, within the 45-day
deadline. If Defendant only served initial verified responses on January 30,
2024, the Motion to Compel further would be untimely—it would have been filed 77
days after responses were filed—and the Court must deny the motion.
Nevertheless, the Court will continue to address the issue of meet and confer
efforts. 
 
 
          Meet and
Confer
 
“The Discovery Act requires that, prior to the initiation of
a motion to compel, the moving party declare that he or she has made a serious
attempt to obtain ‘an informal resolution of each issue.’ [Citations.] This
rule is designed ‘to encourage the parties to work out their differences
informally so as to avoid the necessity for a formal order. . .’ [Citations.]
This, in turn, will lessen the burden on the court and reduce the unnecessary
expenditure of resources by litigants through promotion of informal,
extrajudicial resolution of discovery disputes. . .[T]he law requires that
counsel attempt to talk the matter over, compare their views, consult, and
deliberate.” (Townsend v. Superior Court (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 1431,
1435, 1439.)
 
On February 7, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel sent Defendant’s
counsel a meet and confer letter regarding Defendant’s responses. (Grigoryan
Decl. ¶  22, Exh. 5.) The letter
explained the relevance of each request and why good causes exists to produce
the documents. (Ibid.) On or around March 7, 2024, after having received
no response from Defendant, Plaintiff’s counsel sent a further meet and confer
letter in attempt to informally resolve the discovery dispute. (Grigoryan Decl.
¶  23, Exh. 6.) Plaintiff’s counsel addressed
each objection and limited the discovery requests to Defendant’s internal
investigation and analysis of the same or similar defects that occurred in the
Subject Vehicle or in other vehicles of the same year, make, and model. (Ibid.)
As of the motion’s filing date on March 15, 2024, Defendant had not provided
all of the documents requested. (Grigoryan Decl. ¶  25.) Defendant does not address its meet and
confer efforts in its opposition. Defendant merely suggests that Plaintiff’s
meet and confer efforts were “illusory” and “disengaged.” (Mot. p. 1, line 5;
p. 3, line 14.)
 
The Court is not persuaded that counsel have exhausted their
meet and confer obligations pursuant to the Code. The Court finds that the meet
and confer efforts, if any, have been insufficient considering the number of
outstanding discovery requests—specifically, 101 requests—at issue in the
instant motion. The Court is hopeful that the Stipulation and Protective Order,
signed and granted on February 2, 2024, will facilitate freer exchange of
discovery between the parties. 
 
Therefore, counsel is ordered to make further efforts to
resolve the issues presented. If, after exhausting those efforts, court
intervention is needed, counsel may appear and argue the merits on the
continued hearing date. If counsel is unable to informally resolve their discovery
disputes, then counsel is instructed to submit a joint separate statement with
a detailed outline of the remaining disputed issues for which a ruling is
required. The hearing on Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Request
for Production of Documents, Set Two, is CONTINUED to April 8, 2025 in
Department SE-C at 10:30 a.m. The joint separate statement must be FILED on or
before April 1, 2025.
