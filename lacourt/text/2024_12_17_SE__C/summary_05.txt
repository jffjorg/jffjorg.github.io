And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a lemon law action brought by Plaintiff Francisco Soto against Ford Motor Company and others. Plaintiff seeks to compel further responses to his requests for production, which were served on the defendants in December 2023. The defendants responded and objected to the requests in January 2024, and Plaintiff filed his motion to compel further responses in March 2024.

The Judge finds that Plaintiff's motion is timely, as it was filed within 45 days of the defendants' verified responses. However, the Judge is not persuaded that Plaintiff's counsel has made a sufficient effort to meet and confer with the defendants to resolve the discovery disputes.

The Judge orders Plaintiff's counsel to make further efforts to resolve the issues presented, including the issue of discovery of electronically stored information (ESI). If the parties are unable to informally resolve their discovery disputes, they are instructed to submit a joint separate statement with a detailed outline of the remaining disputed issues for which a ruling is required.

The motion to compel further responses is continued to April 22, 2025, at 10:30 a.m. in Department SE-C.
