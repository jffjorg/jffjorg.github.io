 Case Number:  24NWCV00395    Hearing Date:   December 17, 2024    Dept:  C WILLIS v. AMERICAN  HONDA MOTOR, INC. CASE NO.: 24NWCV00395 HEARING:  December 17,  2024 @ 9:30 a.m.JUDGE: RAUL A. SAHAGUN   #5 TENTATIVE ORDER   Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc.’s Demurrer  to the fifth cause of action for violation of Business and Professions Code §  17200 et seq. is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.    Defendant American  Honda Motor Co., Inc.’s Motion to Strike is MOOT.    Defendant to give  notice.    Background   This is a lemon law action. On February 8, 2024, Plaintiff  Kathryn Willis (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendant American Honda  Motor Co., Inc. (“Defendant”) and Does 1 to 50. Plaintiff contends that  Defendant violated the California Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act  (“Song-Beverly Act”) by failing to repair or replace Plaintiff’s 2022 Honda  Accord (“Subject Vehicle”). The Complaint alleges the following causes of  action: 1) Violation of the Song-Beverly Act § 1793.2(d), (2) Violation of the  Song-Beverly Act § 1793.2(b), (3) Violation of the Song-Beverly Act – Breach of  Express Warranty, (4) Violation of the Song-Beverly Act - Breach of Implied  Warranty, and (5) Violation of Business and Professions Code § 17200 et seq.    Defendant now demurs to the fifth cause of action for violation  of Business and Professions Code § 17200 et seq. Defendant also moves to strike  Prayers for Relief Nos. 3 to 10.    Legal Standard             Standard  for Demurrer   As a general matter, in a demurrer proceeding, the defects  must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice.¿(Donabedian  v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)¿“A demurrer  tests the pleading alone, and not the evidence or facts alleged.” (E-Fab,  Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153  Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such, the court assumes the truth of the  complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Ibid.) The  only issue a demurrer is concerned with is whether the complaint, as it stands,  states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007)  147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)      Where a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be  allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman  v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the plaintiff  to show the court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Id.; Lewis  v. YouTube, LLC (2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) However, “[i]f there  is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause of  action, it is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman  v. Nevada Irrigation Dist. (1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245)              Standard  for Motion to Strike    The court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its  discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or  improper matter inserted in any pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd. (a).)  The court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in  conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.  (Id., § 436, subd. (b).) The grounds for moving to strike must appear on the  face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice. (Id. § 437.)    Meet and Confer    Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a), and  section 435.5, subdivision (a), require meeting and conferring “in person or by  telephone.”    Discussion   Fifth Cause of Action - Violation  of Business and Professions Code §17200   California’s Unfair Competition Law (“UCL”) prohibits unlawful,  unfair, or fraudulent business acts or practices. (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17200.)  Section 17200's “unlawful” prong “borrows violations of other laws. . .and makes  those unlawful practices actionable under the UCL.” (Klein v. Chevron U.S.A.,  Inc. (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1342, 1383.) “[V]irtually any law or regulation—federal  or state, statutory or common law—can serve as [a] predicate for a. . .[section]  17200 ‘unlawful’ violation.’” (Id.) “A business practice is “fraudulent”  within the meaning of section 17200 if it is “likely to deceive the public.” (Id.  at 1380.) A business practice is “unfair” within the meaning of the UCL if it  violates established public policy or if it is immoral, unethical, oppressive, or  unscrupulous and causes injury to consumers which outweighs its benefits. (Nolte  v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1407–1408.)    In order to plead a claim under Business and Professions  Code section 17200, there must be allegations showing an unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent  business act or practice.¿(Paulus v. Bob Lynch Ford, Inc. (2006) 139  Cal. App. 4th 659, 676-677.) To plead this statutory claim, the pleadings must  state with reasonable particularity the facts supporting the statutory elements  of the violation.¿(Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.  App. 4th 612, 619.)¿   Defendant first argues Plaintiff lacks standing because the  Complaint fails to allege that Plaintiff suffered an economic injury as a  result of Defendant’s unlawful, unfair, and fraudulent business practices. The  Court disagrees. The Complaint alleges that Plaintiff suffered an injury in  fact—specifically, that Plaintiff relied on Defendant’s misrepresentations or  omissions, and Plaintiff would not have purchased the vehicle if the Subject  Vehicle’s defects were known. (Compl., ¶ 59.) The Court finds there is no issue  with Plaintiff’s standing under the UCL.   Next, Defendant argues the UCL claim fails to allege facts  sufficient to state a cause of action. Defendant argues the Complaint fails to  allege any unlawful, fraudulent, or unfair practice with specificity. As to the  fraudulent prong, the Complaint does not meet the heightened pleading standard.  Defendant argues the Complaint does not allege any specific misrepresentations  or omissions Plaintiff relied upon or demonstrate how such representations  would likely deceive a reasonable consumer. As to the unfair prong, Defendant  argues the Complaint fails to allege any immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous,  or substantially injurious practice to consumers.   Plaintiff’s opposition does not address why the Complaint’s  allegations are sufficient to state a cause of action under the UCL.  Plaintiff’s opposition merely argues that Plaintiff may seek cumulative  remedies under the UCL and breach of warranty claims.   The Court finds that the Complaint fails to allege facts  sufficient to state a cause of action under the UCL. In support of its  allegation that Defendant violated the “fraudulent” prong of the UCL, the  Complaint states that “the misrepresentations and omissions regarding the  safety and reliability of its vehicles as set forth in this Complaint were  likely to deceive a reasonable consumer, and the information would be material  to a reasonable consumer.” (Compl., ¶ 56.) The Court finds such bare  allegations are insufficient where claims of fraudulent conduct generally must  be pled with heightened specificity. (See Alfaro v. Community Housing Improvement System & Planning Assn., Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1356, 1384 (rule of  specifically pleading how, when, where, to whom, and by what means,  misrepresentations were communicated, applies to affirmative  misrepresentations, but not to fraudulent concealment). Even if the  cause of action is based on fraudulent concealment, the Complaint does not put  Defendant on notice of its alleged “omissions regarding the safety and  reliability of its vehicles” because the Complaint fails to state what the  Subject Vehicle’s defects are. (See Compl., ¶ 6.)   Further, the Complaint fails to identify any particular  unfair or unlawful business practice. The most specific allegation of unfair  conduct is Defendant’s alleged “manufacture and sale of vehicles with similar  defects, and defendant’s failure to adequately investigate, disclose and remedy.  . .” (Compl. ¶ 57.) But again, the Complaint does not describe how Defendant  failed to disclose such defects or explain what the allege defects are. Overall,  the Court finds the allegations for the fifth cause of action are conclusory  and fail to state a cause of action under the UCL.   Accordingly, the Court sustains Defendant’s Demurrer to the  fifth cause of action for violation of Business and Professions Code § 17200 et  seq. with leave to amend.   Motion to Strike   Defendant moves to strike Prayers for Relief Nos. 3 to 10 to  the extent they are made under the fifth cause of action. (Mot., p. 6, lines  15-17.)    The Court initially notes that demurrers and motions to  strike should be noticed and filed separately pursuant to California Rules of  Court, rule 3.1322(b) and Code of Civil Procedure section 435. The Court will  rule on the Motion but advises against this practice in the future.    Because the Demurrer to the fifth cause of action was  sustained, the Court finds the motion to strike is moot.
