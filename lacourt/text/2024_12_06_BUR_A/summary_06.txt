And here is a summary in English text:

The Court is considering a motion by the Plaintiff to compel the Burbank Police Department to comply with a deposition subpoena. The Plaintiff is seeking the police report to identify the attacker and potential witnesses to the assault at John Muir Middle School. The Burbank Police Department has refused to comply with the subpoena, citing the lack of consumer notice under CCP § 1985.3. The Court finds that the Plaintiff has not demonstrated due diligence in obtaining the identity of the attacker, and thus the consumer notice requirement cannot be waived. The Court also finds that Burbank's argument that they were correct to refuse production under the CPRA is misguided, as the Plaintiff made no public information request. The Court orders that the City of Burbank provide the necessary notice to consumers, and denies the motion to compel without prejudice.
