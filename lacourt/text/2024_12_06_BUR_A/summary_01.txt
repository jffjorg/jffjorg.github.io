And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendants' motion to dismiss the plaintiff's complaint without prejudice. The plaintiff, Rhonda Koch-Strauss, brought an action against her neighbors, Vahe Avedian, Susanna Avedian, and Ghevon Avedian, alleging wrongful arrest by sheriff's deputies. However, the defendants moved to quash the service of subpoenas due to defects in the proof of service, and the plaintiff failed to oppose the motion or rectify the defects. As a result, the court finds that the plaintiff has not carried her burden to demonstrate a reasonable excuse for the delay in prosecution, and therefore, the complaint is subject to dismissal without prejudice. The judge notes that the plaintiff is self-represented and may have had reason for failing to oppose the motion, but nonetheless, a dismissal without prejudice would be appropriate.
