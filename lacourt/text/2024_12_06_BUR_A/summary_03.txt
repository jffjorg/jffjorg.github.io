Summary:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling sustains the demurrer to the first and second causes of action with 20 days' leave to amend. The demurrer to the first cause of action is sustained because the pleading does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for breach of contract. The demurrer to the second cause of action is sustained because there is no independent wrongful conduct alleged in the SAC. The motion to strike is moot due to the sustaining of the demurrer. The Judge also addresses the statute of frauds, finding that it does not apply to the oral contract.
