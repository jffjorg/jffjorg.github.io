And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling is a summary of the Court's decision regarding a motion to compel arbitration filed by Tesla Motors, Inc. The motion was brought in response to a petition filed by Anoush Pitzikyan, who alleges that Tesla violated the Song Beverly Act. The Court has reviewed the evidence presented by Tesla, including two agreements containing arbitration clauses, and has determined that these agreements are valid and enforceable. The Court has also found that the agreements apply to the plaintiff's claims and that the plaintiff has failed to oppose the motion. Therefore, the Court grants the motion to compel arbitration and orders a status conference for December 2, 2025, to discuss the arbitration process. The Judge, F.M. Tavelman, has issued the tentative ruling, which will become the final ruling of the Court unless a party requests oral argument or files a request to reconsider.
