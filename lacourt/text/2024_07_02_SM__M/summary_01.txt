And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to disqualify David Schack, Esq. and Barnes and Thornburg LLP as counsel for Royal Lee LLC. The defendant argued that Schack would be a percipient witness to the transactions underlying the dispute and that his testimony would be necessary to prove certain facts. However, the judge found that Schack's testimony would not be genuinely needed, as much of the information he would provide would be undisputed and could be provided by other witnesses. Additionally, the judge found that the defendant's delay in bringing the motion, despite being aware of Schack's role in the case, suggested a tactical purpose and would cause prejudice to the plaintiff if the motion were granted. The judge also noted that the defendant's opening memorandum of points and authorities was deemed excessive and struck certain pages from the document. Finally, the judge emphasized the importance of civility and effective advocacy in the courtroom.
