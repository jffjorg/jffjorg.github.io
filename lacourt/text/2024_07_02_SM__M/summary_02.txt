And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a demurrer to a cross-complaint filed by Ecogreen Construction Inc. against Precise Air Systems. The cross-complaint alleges negligence, breach of contract, and implied indemnity. The judge is reviewing the pleadings to determine whether the cross-complaint states a cause of action.

The judge finds that the cross-complaint does not allege that Precise Air Systems had a duty to indemnify, defend, or contribute to the plaintiff's claimed damages, and therefore the demurrer is sustained as to the first cause of action.

The judge also finds that the demurrer is moot as to the second, third, and fourth causes of action because they are not directed against Precise Air Systems.

The judge overrules the demurrer as to the fifth and sixth causes of action, which allege implied indemnity and contribution.

Finally, the judge overrules the demurrer as to the final cause of action for declaratory relief, which seeks a judicial declaration of the parties' rights and duties regarding indemnity and contribution.

The judge gives the plaintiff 20 days to file an amended cross-complaint.
