And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is considering a motion for leave to amend the complaint by adding alter ego allegations against the defendants and facts supporting a claim for fraud. The Plaintiffs claim that they did not discover the fraud until after the First Amended Complaint was filed, and that the proposed amendments are necessary to correct any deficiencies identified in the First Amended Complaint by the defendants' motion to strike. The defendants oppose the motion, arguing that it is an attempt to delay the litigation and that the proposed amendments would be prejudicial. The Judge finds that the Plaintiffs' motion is granted, as there is no delay in amendment and the defendants show no prejudice stemming from the amendment. The Judge concludes that the interests of justice and judicial economy favor amendment in this case.
