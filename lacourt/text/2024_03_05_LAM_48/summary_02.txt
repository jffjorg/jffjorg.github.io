And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court is considering a demurrer filed by Cross-Defendant, Cannon Constructors South, Inc., to the cross-complaint filed by Cross-Complainant, GPS Painting & Wallcovering. The demurrer is based on the argument that the first, fifth, sixth, and seventh causes of action are time-barred under Code of Civil Procedure sections 337(a) and 337.15(a)(1), (b), and (c). The Court finds that the meet and confer requirement is satisfied, as the parties did confer and discuss the basis for the demurrer.

The Court also finds that the first, fifth, sixth, and seventh causes of action fail as a matter of law. The Purchase Order only refers to a March 24, 2004 Master Subcontract Agreement that is not before the Court, and the parties fail to point to any indemnity provision that would apply to the Purchase Order. Therefore, the demurrer is sustained with leave to amend.
