- "In cases where the assignor of a chose in action is a suspended corporation, California courts generally have recognized that the assignee is subject to the same defenses that could have been asserted against the assignor."
- "This right is not the equivalent of ‘standing in the shoes’ of the insured. Consequently, Truck is not barred by RCS’s disability. Truck has independent standing to preserve its right to claim such contribution as may be available from Transco and Alpine."

Summary:

The tentative ruling is the result of a motion to strike IPL NA's answer filed by Commercial Waste Services, Inc. (CWS). CWS claims that IPL NA lacks capacity to defend due to IPL's disqualification from participating in litigation activities. IPL NA argues that it is the assignee and successor in interest of IPL and should be substituted into the case. The court finds that IPL NA is the assignee and successor in interest, but also finds that IPL NA inherits the disqualification from participating in litigation activities. The court grants the motion to strike IPL NA's answer, but continues the motion to allow IPL to reinstate its corporation status.
