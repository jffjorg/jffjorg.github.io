And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied Weber Enterprise Trucking Corporation's motion to continue the trial date from June 3, 2024. Weber had argued that good cause existed to continue the trial date due to the substitution of new counsel, who needs time to prepare, and the need for additional discovery. Forest Lawn, the defendant, opposed the motion, arguing that the current trial date provides enough time for new counsel to get up to speed and that Weber had already had a previous trial continuance. The Judge found that Weber had not shown good cause for a trial continuance, citing the proximity of the trial date (still three months away) and the fact that new counsel was aware or should have been aware of the trial date when taking the case. The Judge also noted that discovery has not closed, and depositions may be taken within the next three months.
