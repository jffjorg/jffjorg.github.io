And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant Ali Timaji's motion to set aside the entry of default. The Judge notes that the motion was not timely filed within six months of the entry of default, and that the six-month deadline is jurisdictional and not subject to tolling. The motion was also not accompanied by a declaration showing that Defendant Timaji's lack of actual notice in time to defend the action was not caused by avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5. Therefore, the motion is denied.
