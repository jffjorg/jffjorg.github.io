ANALYSIS: 
 
Plaintiff Angelique Vasquez (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant
action for motor vehicle negligence against Defendants Zane Giella and Frank
Giella (“Defendants”) on January 6, 2020. The matter was originally set for
trial on July 6, 2021. When Plaintiff failed to appear at trial, the Court
dismissed the Complaint without prejudice. (Minute Order and Order of
Dismissal, 07/06/21.) On April 5, 2022, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to
vacate the dismissal and set an order to show cause for May 23, 2022. (Minute
Order, 04/05/22.) Defendants filed an answer on July 18, 2022. On December 13,
2022, the Court re-set trial for August 23, 2023. (Minute Order, 12/23/22.) 
 
On June 26, 2023, the Court granted Defendants’ motion to
continue the trial date and set trial for February 13, 2024. (Minute Order,
06/26/23.) Defendants filed the instant
Motion to Continue Trial on October 31, 2023. The motion was set for hearing on
November 28, 2023 and continued to December 13, 2023 with notice waived.
(Minute Order, 11/28/23.) No opposition has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
“Although continuances of
trials are disfavored, each request for a continuance must be considered on its
own merits. The Court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of
good cause requiring the continuance.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332, subd.
(c).) The Court may look to the following factors in determining whether a
trial continuance is warranted: (1) proximity of the trial date; (2) whether
there was any previous continuance of trial due to any party; (3) the length of
the continuance requested; (4) the availability of alternative means to address
the problem that gave rise to the motion; (5) the prejudice that parties or
witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance; and (6) whether trial
counsel is engaged in another trial. 
(See generally, Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332, subd. (d)(1)-(11).)
Additionally, factors for the Court to consider include: a party’s excused
inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence
despite diligent efforts; whether all parties have stipulated to a continuance;
and any other fact or circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the
motion or application. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332, subds. (c), (d).)
 
Defendants argue that good
cause exists for a continuance of the trial date, which is currently set for
February 13, 2024, because discovery is not complete and depositions have not
yet been taken. (Motion, Hillier Decl., ¶¶6-7 and Exh. B.) These circumstances
are reasonable grounds to continue the trial date. There have been two prior
continuances but there is no prejudice to Plaintiff, who stipulates to the
continuance. Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that the factors of Rule
3.1332 weigh in favor of the requested continuance of the trial date. That
being said, the Court notes that this action was filed almost four years ago
and any additional requests for a trial continance will be strongly disfavored.
 
Conclusion
 
Defendants Zane
A. Giella and Frank Giella’s Motion to Continue the Trial Date is GRANTED.
TRIAL IS CONTINUED TO JULY 15, 2024 AT 8:30 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING
STREET COURTHOUSE. DISCOVERY AND MOTION CUTOFF DATES TO FOLLOW THE NEW TRIAL
DATE.
