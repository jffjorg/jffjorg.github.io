And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to compel responses to discovery requests and requests for sanctions. The defendant, Camila Rose, is ordered to serve verified responses to the discovery requests without objections within 20 days of service of this order. The defendant is also ordered to pay sanctions of $773.40 to the plaintiff's counsel within 20 days of service of this order. The judge's decision is based on the defendant's failure to timely respond to the plaintiff's discovery requests, which constitutes a misuse of the discovery process. The sanctions awarded are calculated based on one hour of attorney time billed at $645.00 per hour and two filing fees of $64.20 each.
