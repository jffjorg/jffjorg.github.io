Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal of the case, but has denied the request to enforce the settlement agreement. The case was originally dismissed without prejudice on January 25, 2023, after the plaintiff failed to appear at an order to show cause. The plaintiff filed a motion to vacate the dismissal on July 20, 2023, which was granted because it was timely filed and supported by an affidavit of attorney fault. The judge has reinstated the case under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). However, the judge has denied the request to enforce the settlement agreement because it does not comply with the statutory requirements set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. The settlement agreement was only signed by the defendants, and did not include the signatures of the plaintiff or their counsel, as required by the statute.
