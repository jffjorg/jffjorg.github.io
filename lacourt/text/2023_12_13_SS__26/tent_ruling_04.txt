have Entry of Default Set Aside is DENIED.
 
                                                                                                                                
ANALYSIS:
 
On November 9, 2020, Plaintiff Key Star Capital Fund II, LP (“Plaintiff”)
filed the instant action for breach of contract, breach of guaranty, common
counts, unjust enrichment, and foreclosure of security interest against
Defendants Global Concepts Group, Inc. (“Defendant GCG”), Ali Timaji (“Defendant
Timaji”), and Brenda Manning (“Defendant Manning”). Following Defendants’
failure to file responsive pleadings, the Court entered their default on
December 23, 2020. Default judgment was entered against Defendants on November
9, 2021. Notice of entry of judgment was served on Defendants on November 23,
2021. (Notice of Entry of Judgment, p. 2.) 
 
On October 25, 2023, Defendant Timaji filed the instant
Motion to Set Aside Entry of Default. Plaintiff filed an opposition on December
1, 2023. 
 
Discussion
 
Defendant Timaji moves to vacate the entry of default
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), or section
473.5. As an initial matter, the Court notes that Defendant Timaji only moves
to vacate the entry of default entered on December 23, 2020 but not the default
judgment of November 9, 2021. (Motion, p. 1:25-27.)
 
Under Code of Civil
Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), an application for relief must be made
no more than six months after entry of the order from which relief is sought
and must be accompanied by an affidavit of fault attesting to the mistake, inadvertence,
surprise or neglect of the moving party or its attorney. (Code Civ. Proc., §
473, subd. (b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th
130, 143.) The motion must also be accompanied by a copy of the moving
defendant’s proposed pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) This can be
corrected if Defendant submits a proposed responsive pleading by the hearing
date. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); Carmel, Ltd. v. Tavoussi
(2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 393, 403.) 
 
The instant Motion was not timely filed within six months of
entry of default on December 23, 2020. The six-month deadline is jurisdictional
and not subject to tolling. (Manson, Iver & York v. Black (2009) 176
Cal.App.4th 36, 42.) Therefore, Defendant Timaji cannot obtain relief under
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). 
 
The Motion is also brought under Code of Civil Procedure
section 473.5, subdivision (a), which provides: 
 
When service of a summons has not resulted
in actual notice to a party in time to defend the action and a default or
default judgment has been entered against him or
her in the action, he or she may serve and file a
notice of motion to set aside the default or default judgment and for
leave to defend the action.  The notice of
motion shall be served and filed within a reasonable time, but in no event
exceeding the earlier of: (i) two years after entry of a default judgment
against him or her; or (ii) 180 days after service on him or
her of a written notice that the default or default judgment has
been entered.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5, subd. (a).)
Additionally, the motion “shall be accompanied by an affidavit showing under
oath that the party's lack of actual notice in time to defend the action was
not caused by his or her avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect. The party
shall serve and file with the notice a copy of the answer, motion, or other
pleading proposed to be filed in the action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5, subd.
(b).) 
 
First, it is not clear that the Motion is timely
under this statute. Notice of entry of judgment was served on Defendant Timaji on
November 23, 2021 and 180 days thereafter was May 22, 2022. S the instant
Motion was not filed and served by May 22, 2022, it is arguably untimely. Plaintiff
also presents evidence that Defendant Timaji was aware of this action following
service of the notice of entry of judgment and called Plaintiff’s counsel to
discuss the action on November 30, 2021. (Opp., Sweeny Decl., ¶3.) No
explanation is provided as to why this action was not filed until almost two
years after Defendant called, which delay is unreasonable. Additionally, the
Motion is not accompanied by a declaration that shows under oath that Defendant
Timaji’s lack of actual notice in time to defend the action was not caused by
avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect. (Motion, Timaji Decl., ¶¶B-E.) This
declaration is required before relief under Code of Civil Procedure section
473.5 can be granted. Finally, the Motion is not accompanied by a copy of
Defendant Timaji’s proposed responsive pleading, which is also required under
this statute. Therefore, Defendant Timaji has not demonstrated that relief is
proper under Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Ali Timaji’s Motion to have Entry of Default Set
Aside is DENIED. 
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
