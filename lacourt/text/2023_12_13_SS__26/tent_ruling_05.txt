ANALYSIS:
 
On March 25,
2021, Plaintiff Thomas Boule (“Plaintiff”) filed an action against Defendant
Luxury Meetings, Inc., (“Defendant”) for breach of written guaranty agreement,
breach of written agreement, and unjust enrichment. On January 24, 2022,
Plaintiff filed an Amendment to Complaint, adding Defendant Jacob Ahrens
(“Ahrens”) as Defendant Doe 1. 
 
A non-jury trial
was scheduled for September 22, 2022. On September 22, 2022, the Court noted
that no appearances were entered for Plaintiff or Defendants and dismissed the
Complaint without prejudice. (Minute Order, 09/22/22.)
 
On March 13,
2023, the Court denied Plaintiff’s first Motion to Set Aside Dismissal and
Enter Stipulation for Civil Judgment. (Minute Order, 03/13/23.) On May 3, 2023,
Plaintiff filed another Motion to Set Aside Dismissal and Enter Stipulation for
Civil Judgment (“Motion”). The Court granted Plaintiff’s request to vacate the
dismissal entered on September 22, 2022. (Minute Order, 05/25/23.) However, the
Court denied Plaintiff’s request to enter the stipulation for civil judgment
because the stipulation and settlement agreement were not signed by Plaintiff
or Plaintiff’s representative. (Ibid.) 
 
On June 27, 2023,
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Enter Stipulation for Civil Judgment
(“Motion”). On August 22, 2023, the Court issued a minute order
continuing the hearing to October 4, 2023, pursuant to Plaintiff’s request
because Defendant recently paid the principal amount due to Plaintiff in this
action and the parties are currently negotiating additional fees due. The Court
ordered any additional declaration/further briefing to be filed at least
10-days prior to the continued hearing date. (Minute Order, 08/22/23.)  
 
At
the hearing on October 4, 2023, the case was transferred to Department 26 of
the Spring Street Courthouse and the hearing on the Motion was continued to
December 13, 2023. (Minute Order, 10/04/23.) Plaintiff filed a supplemental
declaration on September 29, 2023.  
 
Discussion
 
The instant motion is brought under Code of Civil Procedure, section
664.6, which states in relevant part:
 
If
parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties
outside the presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of
the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant
to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may
retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until
performance in full of the terms of the settlement.
 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (a).) Prior to January 1, 2021, “parties” under
section 664.6 meant the litigants themselves, not their attorneys.  (Levy v. Superior Court (1995) 10
Cal.4th 578, 586.) The current statute provides that “parties” includes “an
attorney who represents the party” and an insurer’s agent. (Code Civ. Proc., §
664.6, subd. (b).) The settlement must include the signatures of the parties
seeking to enforce the agreement, and against whom enforcement is sought. (J.B.B.
Investment Partners, Ltd. v. Fair (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 974, 985.) Plaintiff has demonstrated the
settlement agreement complies with the statutory requirements set forth above
because it was signed by both parties and their attorneys. (Motion, Supp.
Emanuel Decl., Exh. A, p. 6.)

 
The settlement provides that
Defendant would pay Plaintiff $21,250.00 by May 20, 2022. (Id. at ¶3.) The
settlement agreement also provides that upon Defendant’s default, Plaintiff
would seek judgment in the settlement amount. (Ibid.) Although Defendant
defaulted in its payment by May 20, 2022, Defendant paid the principal balance
on or around August 18, 2023. (Id. at ¶4.) Plaintiff now requests an
order allowing it to move for the attorney’s fees and costs incurred in this
action pursuant to section XV of the settlement agreement. (Motion, Emanuel
Decl., Exh. A, § XV.) 
 
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff
is entitled to entry of judgment against Defendant in the principal amount of $0.00,
plus attorney’s fees and costs according to proof. (See Cal. Rules of Court,
rules 3.1700 and 3.1702.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Thomas Boule’s Motion for Order to Enter
Stipulation for Judgment is GRANTED. JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF PLAINTIFF
IN THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $0.00. ATTORNEY’S FEES AND COSTS MAY BE SOUGHT
PURSUANT TO CAL. RULES OF COURT RULES 3.1700 AND 3.1702.
