And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling granted the defendants' motion to continue the trial date to July 15, 2024. The case involves a motor vehicle negligence claim filed by Angelique Vasquez against Zane A. Giella and Frank Giella. The trial was originally set for July 6, 2021, but was previously continued to February 13, 2024. The defendants' motion was based on the fact that discovery is not complete and depositions have not yet been taken. The court considered the factors outlined in Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332, and determined that good cause exists for the continuance. The court noted that this action was filed over four years ago and any additional requests for a trial continuance will be strongly disfavored.
