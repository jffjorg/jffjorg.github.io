ANALYSIS:
 
On March 29, 2023, Plaintiff Boren, Osher & Luftman, LLP
(“Plaintiff”) served Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Production
of Documents, Set One, on Defendant Camila Rose (“Defendant”) (Motions, Osher Decl., Exh. 1.) Following
Defendant’s failure to serve timely responses, Plaintiff sought to meet and
confer about the outstanding responses. (Id. at Exh. 2.) Due to
Defendant’s continued non-response, Plaintiff filed the instant (1) Motion to Compel
Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions; and (2) Motion
to Compel Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, and
Request for Sanctions on November 13, 2023. No opposition has been filed to
date.
 
Discussion
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to compel initial responses can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290, 2031.300.) Further, the motion can be brought at any time after the
responding party fails to provide the responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.)
Based on Plaintiff’s failure to timely respond to the propounded discovery,
Defendant is entitled to an order compelling service of verified responses to
the discovery requests without objections. 
 
Defendant’s failure to timely respond constitutes a misuse
of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) Sanctions
are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030
and have been properly noticed. However, the sanctions sought are excessive for
simple and unopposed discovery motions. Under a lodestar calculation, sanctions
are awarded in the amount of $773.40 based on one hour of attorney time billed
at $645.00 per hour and two filing fees of $64.20 each. (Motions, Osher Decl., ¶13.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Boren, Osher &
Luftman, LLP’s (1) Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One,
and Request for Sanctions; and (2) Motion to Compel Responses to Request for
Production of Documents, Set One, and Request for Sanctions, are GRANTED. DEFENDANT CAMILA ROSE IS TO SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES TO THE
DISCOVERY REQUESTS WITHOUT OBJECTIONS WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER. DEFENDANT
IS ALSO ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $773.40 TO PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
