STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
Plaintiff Andrea
Arambula (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendant General Motors, LLC
on December 22, 2020. The complaint alleged causes of action based on a breach
of the Song-Beverly Warranty Act. Plaintiff alleges that she purchased the Subject
Vehicle from the Defendant, which later contains defects and malfunctions.
After returning the Vehicle to the Defendant on three separate occasions to fix
these defects, the Vehicle still contains defects. 
 
Defendant General
Motors, LLC filed an Answer on June 4, 2021. 
 
On August 9, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Settlement.
 
On November 8, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for
Attorney Fees and Costs requesting 172.60 hours and $68,311.90. On January 18,
2024, Defendant filed an opposition suggesting that no more than $39,000 should
be awarded. On January 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply. 
 
On January 31, 2024, after conferring with the court, the
parties agreed to meet and confer regarding settlement as to Attorney Fees. The
court continued the hearing on the motion for attorney fees to March 8, 2024.
 
On February 14, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Joint Status Report.
Plaintiff reduced its request to $63,904.90 and Defendant conveyed a final
offer of $48,000 inclusive of costs.
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
A prevailing buyer in an
action under Song-Beverly “shall be allowed by the court to recover as part of
the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses,
including attorney’s fees based on actual time expended, determined by the
Court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the
commencement and prosecution of such action.” 
(Civ. Code, § 1794(d).) By permitting buyers who prevail under
Song-Beverly to recover their attorneys’ fees, “our Legislature has provided
injured consumers strong encouragement to seek legal redress in a situation in
which a lawsuit might not otherwise have been economically feasible.” (Murillo v. Fleetwood Enterprises, Inc.
(1998) 17 Cal.4th 985, 994.)  However, “ ‘[r]easonable compensation does not include
compensation for ‘ “padding” in the form of inefficient or duplicative
efforts....’ [Citations.] ‘A reduced award might be fully justified by a
general observation that an attorney over litigated a case or submitted a
padded bill or that the opposing party has stated valid objections.’ ” (Morris
v. Hyundai Motor America
(2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 24, 38 (Morris).)
 
The prevailing party has the
burden of showing that the requested attorney fees are reasonable. (Robertson v. Fleetwood Travel Trailers of
California Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 785, 817.) The party seeking
attorney fees “is not necessarily entitled to the compensation of the value of
attorney services according to [his or her] own notion or to the full extent
claimed . . . .”  (Levy v. Toyota Motor Sales, USA, Inc. (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 807,
816.) If the “time expended or the monetary charge being made for the time
expended are not reasonable under all circumstances, then the court must take
this into account and award fees in a lesser amount.” (Nightingale v. Hyundai Motor America (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99,
104.)  “ ‘A trial court may not rubber stamp a
request for attorney fees, but must determine the number of hours reasonably
expended.’ ” (Morris, supra, at p.
38.)
 
A calculation of attorneys’
fees for a Song-Beverly action begins with the “lodestar” approach, under which
the Court fixes the lodestar at “the number of hours reasonably expended
multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” (Margolin
v. Regional Planning Com. (1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004-1005.)
“California courts have consistently held that a computation of time spent on a
case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a determination of
an appropriate attorneys’ fee award.” (Ibid.)

 
“It is appropriate for a
trial court to reduce a fee award based on its reasonable determination that a
routine, non-complex case was overstaffed to a degree that significant
inefficiencies and inflated fees resulted.” 
(Morris v. Hyundai Motor America
(2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 24, 39.) It is also appropriate to reduce a fee award
based on “inefficient or duplicative efforts” in the billing record. (Id. at p. 38.) However, the analysis
must be “reasonably specific” and cannot rely on general notions about the fairness
of the fee award. (Kerkeles v. City of
San Jose (2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 88, 102.) Moreover, in conducting the
analysis, courts are not permitted to tie any reductions in the fee award to
some proportion of the buyer’s damages recovery. (Warren v. Kia Motors America, Inc. (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 24,
39.)  
 
The lodestar figure may also
be adjusted, based on consideration of factors specific to the case, in order
to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services provided. (Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25,
49; PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler
(2000) 22 Cal.App.4th 1084, 1095.) The
factors considered in determining the modification of the lodestar include the
nature and difficulty of the litigation, the amount of money involved, the
skill required and employed to handle the case, the attention given, the
success or failure, and other
circumstances in the case. (EnPalm,
LLC v. Teitler Family Trust (2008) 162 Cal. App. 4th 770,
774 (emphasis in original).) A negative modifier was appropriate when
duplicative work had been performed. (Thayer
v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 819.) 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Prevailing Party
 
On or about August 10, 2023, Plaintiff accepted Defendant’s
July 17, 2023 CCP § 998 Offer to Compromise. (Barry Decl., ¶ 34, Exhibit 4.)
Under the SBA, Plaintiff is the prevailing party, and thus, fees and costs are
mandatory.
 
Lodestar Fees
 
The lodestar method looks at the time
spent on a matter multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate. (Serrano,
supra 20 Cal.3d at 49). The
two-step process begins with the lodestar method, which is the time spent on
the matter multiple by the hourly rate. After the lodestar method, the second
step is determining whether a multiplier should be applied. The factors that courts
look at to determine if a multiplier is reasonable are: 1) the novelty and
difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting
them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other
employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122,
1132). 
 
Reasonableness
of Hourly Rate
 
Plaintiff contends that the hourly rates for the attorneys
on the current matter are reasonable. The hourly rates range from $250 to $625
per hour. (Barry Decl. ¶¶ 37, 38, 43.) These rates are appropriate based on the qualifications of the attorneys
and have been previously approved by the Superior Court, District Court, and
other courts throughout California. Defendant does not oppose the
reasonableness of hourly rates proposed.
 
“In determining hourly rates, the court must look to the
“prevailing market rates in the relevant community.” (Bell v. Clackamas County (9th Cir.2003) 341 F.3d 858, 868.)
The rates of comparable attorneys in the forum district are usually used.
(See Gates v. Deukmejian (9th
Cir.1992) 987 F.2d 1392, 1405.) In making its calculation, the court should
also consider the experience, skill, and reputation of the attorney requesting
fees.” (Heritage Pacific Financial, LLC
v. Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 1009.)
 
Here, Plaintiff provided each attorney’s experience, their
schooling background, year admitted to practice, as well as rates that have
been approved by other courts. (Barry Decl. ¶¶ 37, 38, 43, 48-104.) 
 
Accordingly, the hourly rates are reasonable.
 
Reasonableness
of Hours Billed
 
Plaintiff originally sought 172.6 hours and $63,904.90 in
attorney fees. Plaintiff subsequently reduced this request by 9.2 hours for a
new total of 163.4 hours and $58,963.[1]
(Joint Status Report, 2:6-10.) Defendant argues that only 91.8 hours of work on
this case are reasonable. (Opp. 9:4-8.) 
 
Although a verified fee bill is “prima facie evidence the
costs, expenses and services listed were necessarily incurred,” (Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d
677, 682), ultimately, Plaintiff still has the burden to demonstrate the
reasonableness of charges. The court has reviewed the fee bill submitted by
Plaintiff and the proposed reductions by Defendant. As will be shown,
Defendant’s contention that the billings are excessive, duplicative and
unreasonable is well taken.
 
The trial court may reduce a fee award to a car buyer who
prevailed on Song-Beverley Act claims if it finds that it was unreasonable to
have numerous lawyers on a matter that did not present unique or complex
issues, did not involve discovery motions, did not go to trial, and the
attorneys' hourly rates were unreasonably high. (Morris, supra, at p. 37.) Here, the Court
has reviewed the detailed fee bill with an eye for excessive, duplicative or
unreasonable charges as contended by Defendant. Other than some excessive
charges for charges related to motions in limine, fees motion, and miscellaneous
discovery charges, the fees appear reasonable to the Court. 
 
As such, the Court reduces the requested lodestar by $6,300.
In all other respects, the billings are proper and reasonable. To be clear, the
Court finds the reasonable amount of fees, based upon its experience and
knowledge of this type of litigation, the lack of novelty and complexity of
this case, and the professed specialization of Plaintiff’s counsel is $52,663. 
 
Costs
 
Plaintiff requests $4,941.90 in costs. Defendant asks the
court to reduce this request by $550 for court reporter fees that they did not
actually incur. At the time of the initial hearing, the fees had not yet been
incurred. As of today, however, the costs have been incurred. As such, the Court
awards the full amount requested. 
 
 
 
Conclusion: 
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      Motion
for Attorneys’ Fees is GRANTED in part as follows:$52,663. 
2.      Motion
for Costs is GRANTED in the amount of $4,941.90;
3.      Defendant
is ORDERED to remit payment within 45 days of notice of this ruling.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
