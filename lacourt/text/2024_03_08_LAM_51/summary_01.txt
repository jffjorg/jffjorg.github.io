(Civ. Code, ยง 1794(d))
- "Our Legislature has provided injured consumers strong encouragement to seek legal redress in a situation in which a lawsuit might not otherwise have been economically feasible." (Murillo v. Fleetwood Enterprises, Inc. (1998) 17 Cal.4th 985, 994)
- "Reasonable compensation does not include compensation for 'padding' in the form of inefficient or duplicative efforts.... A reduced award might be fully justified by a general observation that an attorney over litigated a case or submitted a padded bill or that the opposing party has stated valid objections." (Morris v. Hyundai Motor America (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 24, 38)
- "A trial court may not rubber stamp a request for attorney fees, but must determine the number of hours reasonably expended." (Morris, supra, at p. 38)
- "It is appropriate for a trial court to reduce a fee award based on its reasonable determination that a routine, non-complex case was overstaffed to a degree that significant inefficiencies and inflated fees resulted." (Morris v. Hyundai Motor America (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 24, 39)
- "The lodestar figure may also be adjusted, based on consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services provided." (Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49)
