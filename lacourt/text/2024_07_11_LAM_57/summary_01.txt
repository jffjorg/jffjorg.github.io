  - "A motion to compel further responses to interrogatories may be brought based on: (1) incomplete statements of compliance; (2) inadequate, evasive or incomplete claims of inability to comply; or (3) unmerited or overly generalized objections." (CCP § 2030.300(c))
  - "If the moving party has shown good cause for the requests for production, the burden is on the objecting party to justify the objections." (Kirkland v. Superior Court (2002) 95 Cal. App.4th 92, 98)
```

The tentative ruling grants the motions to compel further responses to special interrogatories and requests for production of documents, and awards sanctions against the Plaintiffs for their failure to adequately respond to discovery requests. The Court finds that the Plaintiffs' objections were unmerited and lacked substantial justification.
