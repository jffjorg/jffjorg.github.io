And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Mayra Sandoval dba Ilusiones (Plaintiff) vs. LA Celebrations, LLC (Defendant). The Plaintiff sued the Defendant over an alleged agreement for the use of a party hall in 2022. The Defendant filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, which the Judge has granted with leave to amend.

The Judge determined that the motion was timely, as it was filed before the 30-day deadline from the initial trial date. However, the Judge found that the Plaintiff's complaint did not sufficiently plead the existence of a contract, which is necessary to prove the breach of contract claim. The Judge also found that the complaint did not identify a specific third party with whom the Plaintiff had an economic relationship, which is necessary to prove the claims of intentional and negligent interference with prospective economic relations.

The Judge granted the motion as to the breach of contract claim, the claims of intentional and negligent interference with prospective economic relations, and the declaratory relief claim, all with leave to amend. The Plaintiff is directed to file and serve an amended complaint by August 8, 2024, and the Court will assess the state of the pleadings at a further status conference on October 24, 2024.
