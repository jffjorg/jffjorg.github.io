 Case Number:  22STCV13054    Hearing Date:   July 11, 2024    Dept:  57  
 
Plaintiff
Mayra Sandoval dba Ilusiones (“Plaintiff”) sued Defendant LA Celebrations, LLC
(“Defendant”) over an alleged agreement through which Plaintiff would rent a
party hall from Defendant to use on several days in 2022.  In her complaint, Plaintiff asserts claims
against Defendant for (1) breach of contract; (2) intentional interference with
prospective economic relations; (3) negligent interference with prospective
economic relations; and (4) declaratory relief.   Pending before the Court is Defendant’s
motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
Section 438 as to all of the claims in Plaintiff’s complaint (“the Motion”).  The Court is granting the Motion with leave
to amend.  Plaintiff is directed to file
and serve an amended complaint by August 8, 2024.  The Court will assess the state of the
pleadings at the further status conference, which is scheduled for October 24,
2024.
 
TIMELINESS
OF THE MOTION 
 
Plaintiff’s
contention that the Motion is untimely is mistaken  The time limitation for filing a statutory
motion for judgment on the pleadings under Section 438 is as follows: the
motion cannot be “made” after entry of a “pretrial conference order pursuant to
Section 575, or within 30 days of the date the action is initially set for
trial, whichever is later, unless the court otherwise permits.”  (Section 438(e); see Tung v. Chicago Title
Co. (2021) 63 Cal.App.5th 734, 757.)   The pretrial conference order mentioned in
Section 438(e) refers to the case management order.  The case management order in this action was entered
on January 12, 2023, following a case management conference that day.  At the case management conference, the Court initially
set the action for trial on September 9, 2024. 
(The trial date subsequently was moved to February 24, 2025.)  Thirty days prior to September 9, 2024 is
August 9, 2024.  The Motion was filed on
June 10, 2024, which is not within 30 days of the initial trial date of
September 9, 2024.  Accordingly, the Motion
was timely. 
 
SUBSTANCE
OF THE MOTION 
 
1.   
Breach of
Contract 
 
“To establish a cause of
action for breach of contract, the plaintiff must plead and prove (1) the
existence of the contract, (2) the plaintiff's performance or excuse for
nonperformance, (3) the defendant's breach, and (4) resulting damages to the
plaintiff.”  (Maxwell v. Dolezal
(2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 93, 97-88.)   To establish the existence of a contract, a
party must attach the contract to the complaint, set forth the terms of the
contract in the complaint, or plead the operative effect of the contract within
the complaint.  (Miles v. Deutsche
Bank National Trust Co. (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 394, 401-402.)  Here, Plaintiff did none of the above.  The complaint simply asserts there was an
agreement for the use of a party hall, and that is it.  This is insufficient.  Accordingly, the Court is granting the Motion
as to the breach of contract claim with leave to amend. 
 
2.   
Intentional
Interference with Prospective Economic Relations and Negligent Interference
with Prospective Economic Relations 
 
A
common element of the complaint’s second claim for intentional interference with
prospective economic relations and third claim for negligent interference with prospective
economic relations is an economic relationship between the plaintiff and a
third party.  (Gaab & Reese, Cal.
Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial Claims and Defenses (The Rutter
Group, 2023) ¶ 3:152.)  Here, for both claims,
the complaint alleges that “Plaintiff had enjoyed continued success with the
location and goodwill” and that Defendant “knew of these continued
relationships with customers.” (Compl., ¶¶ 13-14, 19-20.) Because the complaint
does not identify a specific third party with whom Plaintiff had an economic
relationship, both the second and third claims fail.  Plaintiff’s opposition to the Motion mounts
no defense on this point.  Accordingly,
the Court is granting the Motion as to the second and third claims with leave
to amend. 
 
3.   
Declaratory
Relief 
 
For
the declaratory relief claim, “Plaintiff requests that this court issue a
declaration mandating defendant to comply with the contracts for the events to
take place at their respective dates and issue an order accordingly.” (Compl.,
¶ 24.) The fourth claim fails for the reason the first claim fails: the complaint
does not sufficiently plead “the contracts” on which both claims are based.  The Court thus grants the Motion as to the
fourth claim with leave to amend.
