And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling is regarding a demurrer and motion to strike filed by Burlington Coat Factory of Texas, Inc. (Defendant) against Alica Reznic-Alihanjan (Plaintiff). The Court finds that the demurrer to the fourth cause of action (gross negligence) is sustained with 20 days' leave to amend. The Court holds that gross negligence is not a separate cause of action in California and that the allegations of gross negligence are identical to those of ordinary negligence.

The Court also grants the motion to strike punitive damages. The Court finds that the allegations of punitive damages are predicated entirely on the claim of negligence and that there is no evidence of intentional conduct or severity to support a claim for punitive damages.

The Court orders that the demurrer to the fourth cause of action is sustained with 20 days' leave to amend and that the motion to strike punitive damages is granted without leave to amend.
