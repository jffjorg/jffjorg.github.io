I.      
MOTIONS
TO COMPEL FURTHER
“Any party may obtain discovery . . . by propounding to any other party to
the action written interrogatories to be answered under oath.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.010(a).) If a
propounding party is not satisfied with the response served by a responding
party, the former may move the court to compel further interrogatory
responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300;
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.
Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)  The propounding party must demonstrate that
the responses were incomplete, inadequate or evasive, or that the responding
party asserted objections that are either without merit or too general.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300(a)(1)–(3); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 403.)
“A propounding party may demand a responding
party to produce documents that are in their possession, custody or control.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.010.) A party may likewise conduct discovery by
propounding interrogatories to another party to be answered under oath. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2030.010, subd. (a).) The responding party must respond to the
production demand either by complying, by representing that the party lacks the
ability to comply, or by objecting to the demand. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.210.) The responding party must respond to the interrogatories by
answering or objecting. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.210, subd. (a).) If the
responding party fails to serve timely responses, the propounding party may move
for an order compelling responses to the production demand and interrogatories.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.)
 
Plaintiff Eliseo Parra (Plaintiff) moves to
compel further responses to Special Interrogatories No. 52, 73, 74, 90, 92–94,
96, 98, 102, 106, and 107; Request for Production No. 69; Form Interrogatories
– Employment No. 211.1 and 217.1, and Requests for Admission No. 29 and 36.
 
The special interrogatories were as follows.
Interrogatories No. 52 and 94 sought information related to Defendant Vitello,
Inc.’s (Defendant’s) contacts with Plaintiff in May 2020 or after. To which
Defendant responded by offering objections and stating that it “attempted to
contact Plaintiff numerous times” using Plaintiff’s contact information.
(Separate Statement at pp. 2, 11.) Interrogatories No. 73 and 74 asked
Defendant to identify its directors, managers, and officers, and state their
relationships to co-defendants, to which Defendant offered objections.
(Separate Statement at pp. 6–7.) Interrogatories No. 90, 92, and 93 asked
Defendant to identify (i.e. provide the name and contact information) for given
employees, to which Defendant provided names and hiring and firing dates.
(Separate Statement at pp. 7–9.) Interrogatory No. 96 sought the job titles for
each of Defendant’s employees as of January 2020, to which Defendant responded
with 10 job titles. (Separate Statement at p. 12.) Interrogatories No. 98, 102,
and 106 sought the name, age, and job title for each employee of Defendant’s as
of January 2020, 2021, and 2022, to which Defendant responded by reference to a
response to Interrogatory No. 28, which purportedly contained all names of
prior employees for the past five years. (Separate Statement at pp. 13–16.)
Finally, Interrogatory No. 107 asked the date that Defendant applied for any
COVID relief, to which Defendant offered objections. (Separate Statement at pp.
16–17.) 
 
A further response is required as to
Interrogatories No. 52 and 94. Defendant argues in opposition that its
operations were ended in February 2019 and transferred to co-defendant
Vitello’s Restaurant, LLC at the same time, and further that Vitello’s
Restaurant “is a small company” that tried “to tack down former employees.”
(Separate Statement at pp. 1–2.) Defendant does not explain why this
information was not contained in the response to the interrogatories.
 
Further responses are also required as to
Interrogatories No. 73 and 74. Although Defendant contends that it has not been
an active corporation since February 2019, Plaintiff presents documents
indicating that Defendant later applied for and received a COVID relief loan in
2020. (Supp. Kayyali Decl. Exh. 10.) Indeed, a California Business Search with
the Secretary of State indicates that Vitello’s Inc., a California corporation
whose agent for service is its present counsel, is “active.” A further response
is required, and Defendant’s objections based on relevance are overruled.
 
Further responses are also required as to
Interrogatories No. 90, 92, and 93, as Defendant provides no explanation for
failing to provide the contact information requested except that it is a “small
company” and is “trying to track down former employees.” (Separate Statement at
pp. 7–9.) If information is not reasonably with Defendant’s possession, the
Discovery Act provides a means to convey this information. (Code Civ. Proc. §
2030.220, subd. (c).) The same rationale requires a further response to Interrogatory
No. 94, as Defendant’s reason for failing to respond is the same. (Separate
Statement at p. 10.) 
 
A further response is also required to
Interrogatories No. 96, 98, 102, and 106, which sought employee information.
Although Defendant contends that all responsive information was provided in a
spreadsheet responsive to Interrogatory No. 28, Plaintiff contends that the
response to Interrogatory No. 28 contains only employee names, “status,” and
hiring date. Although Defendant attached an additional spreadsheet with
additional information in meet-and-confer correspondence, Defendant did not, as
Plaintiff requested, offer its explanations and additional information by a
verified formal response. (Motion Exh. 8.) A further verified response is
required. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.250.) 
 
And a further response is required as to
Interrogatory No. 107. This interrogatory sought information related to
Defendant’s COVID relief applications. This interrogatory seeks relevant
information, as Defendant contends that it ceased operations in February 2019,
even as it remains listed as active with the California Secretary of State and
is publicly listed as a recipient of COVID aid funds. (Supp. Kayyali Decl. Exh.
10.) Defendant’s defenses in this action provide a basis for seeking the
information.
 
The motion is therefore GRANTED as to the
Special Interrogatories in their entirety. 
 
A further response is also required as to
Request for Production No. 69, which seeks documents related to Defendant’s
requests for COVID aid. (Separate Statement.) Defendant responded with
objections, and argues that the request is not supported by good cause. But
once again, Defendant contends it was not operational by the time the pandemic
began. Thus information concerning its aid applications is relevant to test this
claim. The motion is GRANTED as to Request No. 69.
 
The motion is also properly granted as to the
Form Interrogatories. Form Interrogatory No. 211.1 asked for the identification
of each type of “benefit” the employee would have been entitled to from the
date of the adverse employment action, had the action not happened. (Separate
Statement at p. 2.) Defendant responded with an objection that the question was
argumentative, because it assumed an adverse employment action had taken place.
(Ibid.) But Defendant acknowledges that Plaintiff at one point stopped coming
into work, and appears to infer that he was laid off with the advent of the
COVID pandemic. (Separate Statement at pp. 4–5.) Defendant in opposition argues
that it provided the requested information in meet-and-confer correspondence
(Separate Statement at pp. 1–2), but once again did not put the information a
verified interrogatory response, and in any event this informal information
omits the amounts called for by the interrogatory. (Separate Statement at pp.
1–2.)
 
Form Interrogatory No. 217.1 sought facts and
evidence supporting all responses to requests for admission other than an
admission, and Defendant provided an omnibus response consisting solely of a
broad statement of facts, without supporting witnesses or documents. (Separate
Statement at pp. 3–7.) Plaintiff identifies several admissions that received no
treatment in Defendant’s response, and Defendant in opposition attempts to
supply the missing factual content in its oppositional separate statement,
effectively confirming that no such facts were given. (Ibid.) Thus the
motion is GRANTED as to Form Interrogatories.
 
Finally, a further response is required to
Requests for Admission No. 29 and 36. Request No. 29 sought an admission that Defendant
kept no corporate minutes, to which Defendant only objected. (Separate
Statement at pp. 1–2.) Defendant repeats that it’s not an active corporation,
but as explained above, this is no barrier to the discovery. (Ibid.)
Request No. 36 sought an admission that it replaced the employees it terminated
in May 2020 with younger employees, to which Defendant objected. (Separate
Statement at p. 3.) Defendant in opposition once more tries to claim its
informal meet and confer correspondence as a substitute for an actual verified
response. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.240.)
 
The motions are therefore GRANTED in their
entirety.
 
II.    SANCTIONS
Statute provides that the court shall impose sanctions upon
a party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response
to interrogatories, requests for production of documents, or requests for
admission, absent substantial justification otherwise or a finding that
sanctions would be unjust under the circumstances.  (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.300, subd. (d);
2031.310, subd. (h); 2033.290, subd. (d).)
 
Plaintiff seeks $5,010.00 in connection with each motion, representing
nine hours of attorney work for each motion at $550, plus a $60 filing fee, for
a total sanctions request of $20,040.00. 
Sanctions are Denied. Considering the meet and confer efforts of the
parties, monetary sanctions at this juncture would be unjust.
