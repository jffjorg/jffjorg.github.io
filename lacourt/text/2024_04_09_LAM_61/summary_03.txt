And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Eliseo Parra's motions to compel further responses to special interrogatories, requests for production, and requests for admission from Defendant Vitello's Inc. The ruling finds that Defendant's responses to interrogatories were incomplete, inadequate, or evasive, and that Defendant failed to provide complete and relevant information.

The Court orders Defendant to provide further responses to interrogatories and requests for production, and to provide additional information to support its claims. The Court also orders Defendant to provide a verified response to Form Interrogatory No. 211.1, which asked for information about employee benefits.

The Court denies Plaintiff's request for sanctions against Defendant, finding that the parties have made efforts to meet and confer and that monetary sanctions at this juncture would be unjust.
