And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court's tentative ruling denies Plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees in the amount of $102,231.75. The court finds that Plaintiff has failed to show an entitlement to fees pursuant to Civil Code § 8800. Specifically, the court notes that Plaintiff has failed to provide evidence that it gave Defendants notice demanding payment pursuant to the contract, as required by Civil Code § 8800, subdivision (a). Additionally, the court finds that Plaintiff has failed to explain how its invoices comply with Business and Professions Code § 7159, subdivision (d)(9). As a result, the court need not address the reasonableness of the fees incurred.
