Court approval is required for all settlements of a minor’s
claim.  (Prob. Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; Code Civ. Proc., §
372.)  California Rules of Court Rule 7.950 provides that a petition “must be
verified by the petitioner and must contain a full disclosure of all
information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of the
compromise.”  (See Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 7.950.)  Rule 7.950 states that the Petition must be

Compromise of
Claim or Action or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or Person With
a Disability (form MC-350).
Discussion
Petitioner Joseph Vasquez (“Petitioner”) seeks court
approval of a settlement between minor claimant Jolene Vasquez (“Claimant”)
(DOB: 11/1/14) and Defendants in the total amount of $10,500.00. (Petition, ¶ 10).
Petitioner is Claimant’s parent and guardian ad litem. (Id., ¶ 1).
The petition is executed by Petitioner. The petition
explains that on October 6, 2022, Claimant was a passenger riding in a vehicle
driven by Georgina Vasquez on the Interstate 10, 400 feet east of Athol Street
in Baldwin Park, California when said vehicle was struck in the rear by a
vehicle driven by Villa. (Id., ¶¶ 4-5). Villa was employed by vehicle
owner Reliable. (Id., ¶ 5).
Claimant sustained pain to her hip, neck, back, shoulder and
abdomen in the accident, for which she received treatment in the emergency room
at Beverly Hospital and follow-up chiropractic treatment with Gabriel Marichi,
D.C. (Id., ¶ 7). Claimant has recovered completely from the effects of
the aforesaid injuries and there are no permanent injuries. (Id., ¶ 8).
To settle claims arising out of the same accident that
resulted in Claimant’s injury, one or more defendants have also offered to pay
money to a person or persons other than Claimant, in the amount of $82,000.00.
(Id., ¶ 11). Petitioner does not have a claim against the recovery of
the Claimant. (Id.) Petitioner is not a plaintiff in the same action
with Claimant. (Id.)
Claimant’s total medical expenses are $3,156.21, before any
reductions. (Id., ¶ 12). Medical expenses were paid in the amount of
$764.01, which includes $484.71 by Plaintiff’s counsel. (Id.). There are
a total of $792.20 in negotiated reductions and a total of $1,600.00 in liens. (Id.). Total medical expenses of $1,600.00 are
to be paid or reimbursed from the proceeds, in addition to the $484.71 fronted
by Plaintiff’s counsel. (Id.).
The total amount of attorney’s fees for which court approval
is requested is $2,395.00. (Id., ¶ 13). Petitioner has attached a
declaration from attorney Deedra Van Strien Alvarado (“Van Strien Alvarado”)
regarding attorney’s fees as Attachment 13(a). Van Strien Alvarado advises that
her firm was retained on October 17, 2022 to represent Claimant on a
contingency basis at a rate of 33% pre-litigation and 40% post-litigation and
attached a copy of the signed retainer agreement as Attachment 17(a). Van
Strien Alvarado further advises that she was also retainer to represent
Claimant’s mother and the vehicle driver, Georgina Vasquez, that she previously
settled that matter, and that this was a separate claim involving no
apportionment of settlement. Van Strien Alvarado advises that she has received
attorney’s fees from the above-settled matter (i.e., in the amount of
$27,333.33) and expects to receive attorney fees in this matter once it is
approved by the court. (Attachment 13(a); see also Petition, ¶ 17). Van Strien
Alvarado advises that she has reduced her fees here to 25% and has diligently
investigated as to all other assets of defendants. Petitioner also requests
that costs of $435.00 by paid from the proceeds. (Id., ¶ 13).
The net balance of proceeds for Claimant after payment of
all requested fees and expenses is $5,585.29, which will be deposited in an
insured account at Wells Fargo Bank in West Covina. (Id., ¶ 18,
Attachment 18(b)(2).
The court finds the settlement is fair and reasonable. The
petition is granted.
