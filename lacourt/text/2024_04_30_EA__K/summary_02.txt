```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the Plaintiffs' motion for summary adjudication on all issues. The judge finds that the motion is inappropriate for resolution via summary adjudication as it does not completely dispose of a cause of action, affirmative defense, claim for damages, or issue of duty. Specifically, the judge finds that the issues presented in the motion are not suitable for summary adjudication as they require further factual development and legal analysis. The judge notes that the Plaintiffs' motion fails to comply with California Rules of Court Rule 3.1350 and that the court declines to rule on the Plaintiffs' request for judicial notice and evidentiary objections as unnecessary to the disposition of the motion.
