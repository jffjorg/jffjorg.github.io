 Case Number:  KC070403    Hearing Date:   April 30, 2024    Dept:  K Plaintiff R. Hayes,
Inc.’s Motion to Fix Amount of Attorney’s Fees Awardable as Item of Costs is DENIED.

Background   
Plaintiff R. Hayes, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) alleges as
follows: On or about October 5, 2017, Plaintiff entered into an oral agreement
with Ran Li and Crystal Aixinjuelou (collectively, “Defendants”) based on a
written estimate provided to the Defendants’ homeowners insurance company, wherein
Plaintiff agreed to provide general remodeling services for the property
located at 19103 Singingwood, Rowland Heights, Los Angeles, CA (“subject
property”). This estimate did not include overhead and profit, which was billed
separately. Plaintiff provided Defendants with h invoices in the amounts
of: (1) $9,101.21, (2) $9,646.98, (3) $9,000.00, (4) $6,579.22, (5) $2,774.81,
and (6) $657.93, totaling $37,760.15. Invoices #1-#3 comprised the work that
was paid by the insurance company, while Invoices #4 and #5 were for overhead
and profit and Invoice #6 was for additional work requested by Defendants that
was not included on the estimate given to Defendants’ homeowners insurance
company. Although Plaintiff received joint checks for $9,101.21, $9,646.98 and
$9,000.00 from the Defendants’ mortgage lender, those checks were endorsed by
Plaintiff and given to Defendants for deposit into Defendants’ bank account.
Plaintiff only received part of the check proceeds for the amount of $9,000.00
on Invoice #1 only. Defendants failed
to pay $28,760.15.
On February 8, 2022,
Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint, asserting causes of action against
Defendants and Does 1-100 for:
1.      Breach of Contract
2.      Foreclosure of Mechanics’ Lien
3.      Quantum Meruit
4.      Fraud and Deceit
On June 16, 2023,
judgment was entered.
Legal
Standard
“Except as otherwise expressly provided by statute, a
prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any
action or proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (b).)
“The following items are
allowable as costs under Section 1032: . . . (10) Attorney's fees, when
authorized by any of the following: (A) Contract. (B) Statute. (C) Law.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1033.5, subd. (a)(10).)
“Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the owner and direct
contractor, the owner shall pay the direct contractor, within 30 days after
notice demanding payment pursuant to the contract is given, any progress
payment due as to which there is no good faith dispute between them. The notice
given shall comply with the requirements of Chapter 2 (commencing with Section
8100) of Title 1.” (Civ. Code., § 8800, subd. (a).)
“An owner that violates this section is liable to the direct
contractor for a penalty of 2 percent per month on the amount wrongfully
withheld, in place of any interest otherwise due. In an action for collection
of the amount wrongfully withheld, the prevailing party is entitled to costs
and a reasonable attorney's fee.” (Civ. Code., § 8800, subd. (c).)
Discussion
Plaintiff moves the
court, per Civil Code § 8800, subdivision (c), for an award of attorney’s fees in the
amount of $102,231.75.
Request for Judicial Notice
The court rules on Defendants’ Request for Judicial Notice
(“RJN”) as follows: Granted as to Request No. 1 (i.e., complaint filed June 25,
2018); Granted as to Request No. 2 (i.e., First Amended Verified Complaint
(“FAC”) filed February 8, 2022) and Granted as to Request No. 3 (i.e., June 5,
2023 minute order).
Merits
1.                 
Entitlement to Fees 
The motion was originally set for hearing on October 31,
2023; at that time, the court continued the hearing to January 26, 2024
(subsequently continued to January 31, 2024) and advised that it needed
“further briefing how the various invoices introduced as trial exhibits comply
with the provisions of section 8800.” On January 31, 2024, the court continued
the hearing to April 30, 2024.
On June 5, 2023, the court ruled in favor of Plaintiff on
Causes of Action Nos. 1-3 in the total amount of $25,327.41 and in favor of
Defendants on Cause of Action No. 4 and noted that “[a]ttorney’s fees pursuant
to Civil Code section 8800 [would] be considered through a noticed Motion for
Attorneys’ Fees.” On June 16, 2023, judgment was entered, with attorney’s fees
to be determined “per motion.”
Defendants assert that Plaintiff is not, in fact, entitled
to recovery of fees pursuant to Civil Code § 8800, subdivision (c) on the basis
that there is no progress payment contract in this case.
Plaintiff alleged in its FAC that
Plaintiff and Defendants “entered into an oral agreement based on a written
estimate provided to the Defendants’ homeowners insurance company whereby
Plaintiff agreed to provide general remodeling services, including providing
and installing flooring, shelves, painting and mold remediation at [Property]”
(FAC, ¶ 9); that this estimate cost of $32,755.94 “did not include overhead and
profits, which was billed separately” (Id.); that
Defendants agreed to pay Plaintiff (Id.); that
Plaintiff furnished the services (Id., ¶ 12); that Plaintiff provided
Defendants with various invoices (Id., ¶ 10), that Invoices #1-#3, in
the amounts of $9,101.21, $9,646.98 and $9,000.00, “comprise[d] the work that
was paid by the insurance company” (Id.); that Invoices #4 and #5 were
“invoices for overhead and profit” and that Invoice #6 was “for additional work
requested by Defendants . . . not included in the estimate given to the
Defendants’ homeowners insurance company” (Id., ¶ 11); that Defendants
breached the oral contract by failing to pay $28,760.15 (Id., ¶ 13); and
that, although Plaintiff received joint checks from Defendants’ mortgage
lender, those checks were endorsed by Plaintiff and given to Defendants for
deposit into Defendants’ bank account and Plaintiff only received part of the
check proceeds on the first invoice only (Id.). 
The court previously noted that Plaintiff had not supported
its motion with any evidence reflecting that Plaintiff and Defendants reached
an agreement about the work schedule and/or payment schedule in the first
instance. Although Plaintiff contended that “the Court found that Defendants
wrongfully withheld progress payments due to [Plaintiff]” (Motion, 5:24-25) and
that “[t]he Court has already found that Defendant wrongfully withheld progress
payments due to [Plaintiff] who is the prevailing party and is entitled to
recover its attorneys’ fees under Civil Code § 8800” (Reply, 6:11-13),
Plaintiff did not support the foregoing statements with citations to any evidence.[1] Plaintiff’s
supplemental briefing fails to identify where in the record these findings were
allegedly made by the court.
Additionally, the court previously observed that Plaintiff did
not support its motion with any evidence reflecting that Plaintiff gave
Defendants details of progress payments (defined in Business & Professions
Code § 7159, subdivision (d)(9) as payments “other than the downpayment”)
meeting the requirements set forth in section 7159. Business and Professions
Code § 7159, subdivision (d)(9) provides as follows:
            If payments, other than the
downpayment, are to be made before the project
is
completed, the details of these payments, known as progress payments, 
shall
be expressed in substantially the following form, and shall include the text 
of
the statement as specified in subparagraph (C):
 
(A)            
A
schedule of progress payments shall be preceded by the heading: ‘Schedule of
Progress Payments.’
(B)             
Each
progress payment shall be stated in dollars and cents and specifically 
reference
the amount of work or services to be performed and materials and 
equipment
to be supplied.
(C)             
The
section of the contract reserved for the progress payments shall include 
the
following statement in at least 12-point boldface type:
 
‘The
schedule of progress payments must specifically describe each phase of 
work,
including the type and amount of work or services scheduled to be supplied 
in
each phase, along with the amount of each proposed progress payment. IT IS
AGAINST THE LAW FOR A CONTRACTOR TO COLLECT PAYMENT FOR WORK NOT YET COMPLETED,
OR FOR MATERIALS NOT YET DELIVERED. HOWEVER, A CONTRACTOR MAY REQUIRE A
DOWNPAYMENT.’
Plaintiff has failed to provide the court with copies of any
of the invoices in both its initial and supplemental briefing. Regardless, even
if the invoices are considered,[2]
Plaintiff has failed to explain how they complied with Business and Professions
Code § 7159, subdivision (d)(9). 
The three invoices reference Defendants as the insureds on
insurance Claim #: AAA012977366. Invoices #1000 and #1001 informed the insurer
about “Work in progress,” Invoice #1002 informed the insurer about the “Final
Insurance Claim” and Invoice #1003 informed the insurer about labor performed
in February and March 2018 and material furnished in February 2018. Plaintiff
concedes that its Invoices #1000, #1001, #1002 and #1003 “were to be paid and
were paid by Defendant’s [sic] insurance company.” (Supp. Brief, 2:27-28).
The court previously noted that Plaintiff failed to support
its motion with any evidence reflecting that Plaintiff gave Defendants “notice demanding
payment pursuant to the contract” which “compl[ied] with the requirements of
Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 8100) of Title 1,” as required by Civil Code
§ 8800, subdivision (a). Civil Code § 8102 provides that such notice must
include the names and addresses of the owner or reputed owner, direct
contractor and construction lender, if any, “[a] description of the site
sufficient for identification, including the street address of the site, if
any,” “[t]he name, address and relationship to the parties of the person giving
notice” and, if the person giving notice is a claimant, “[a] general statement
of the work provided,” “[t]he name of the person to or for whom the work is
provided” and “[a] statement or estimate of the claimant’s demand, if any,
after deducting all just credits and offsets.”
Again, Plaintiff has failed to provide the court with copies
of any of the invoices. Additionally, even if considered, the invoices do not
constitute demands for payment from Defendants. At any rate, the court previously
observed that Plaintiff has failed to support its motion with any evidence
reflecting compliance with Civil Code § 8118.[3]
Defendants argued that “[a]t trial, no evidence was produced to prove that such
notices were given to defendants. Mr. Hayes only testified that he gave
invoices to defendants. Defendants denied receiving invoices from Plaintiff.”
(Opp., 4:3-6). Plaintiff, in its supplemental brief, states only that “Robert
Hayes testified that he hand delivered each invoice to Defendants at their
residence.” (Supp. Brief, 11:14-25; Reply Supp. Brief, 3:6-8). Plaintiff’s
position is not supported by any evidence, including a proof of notice
declaration as per section 8118.
2.                 
Reasonableness of Fees
Inasmuch as Plaintiff has failed to show an entitlement to
fees pursuant to Civil Code § 8800, the court need not address whether or not
the fees incurred were reasonable.
Conclusion
The motion is denied.
