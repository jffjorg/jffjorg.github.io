And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The Judge has granted the motion to strike portions of the First Amended Complaint filed by defendants Snehal Raj Bhakta and Raj Bhakta. The Plaintiffs, Daniel Galvan and Jayden Galvan, had alleged that the defendants were negligent and liable for damages. The Judge has struck the portions of the complaint that alleged punitive damages against the defendants, as the Plaintiffs failed to allege any aggravating factors that would support a claim for punitive damages. The Judge has also scheduled a Case Management Conference for April 30, 2024, to hear from counsel for the Plaintiffs as to whether they wish to amend their complaint and to require an offer of proof if so.
