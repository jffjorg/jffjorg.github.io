And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal and enter judgment in favor of the plaintiff. The plaintiff, Student Loan Solutions, LLC, had filed a complaint alleging breach of contract and common count against the defendant, Jemellee L. Corpuz Sein, who had failed to repay a loan. The parties had entered into an agreement for compromise and stipulation for entry of judgment in the event of default, which provided for the defendant to make monthly payments towards the loan balance. Despite the defendant's partial payments, the plaintiff sought to set aside the dismissal and enter judgment in favor of the plaintiff. The court granted the motion, ordering the defendant to pay the remaining balance of $27,577.10, consistent with the terms of the agreement.
