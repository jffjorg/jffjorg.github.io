Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to set aside the entry of default. The defendant, LJ Supply Chain, Inc., claimed that it was mistaken about the need to file a response to the complaint and that its president, Jie He, was not personally served with the summons and complaint. However, the judge found that the defendant did not meet its burden of showing that the default was entered as a result of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The defendant's assumptions about the need to respond to the complaint were not based on any information provided, and the judge denied the motion.
