ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Discussion
 
This Court’s Trial Orders require that Counsel attend
an informal discovery conference before any discovery motion will be heard in a
Lemon Law case. (See Court’s Trial Orders, § VIII.) That has not occurred
regarding the Motion. 
 
The Court takes the motion off calendar because
Counsel have not participated in an informal discovery conference. 
 
II.      
Conclusion 
 
The Motion is TAKEN OFF CALENDAR.
