Berschneider (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 916, 921)
- "Our reading of the mandatory provision of section 473, subdivision (b) and the long line of cases applying this section compels us not to endorse an overly expansive interpretation of the statute. Counsel missed the court-ordered deadline to move for attorney fees. Section 473 provides no relief for such error." (Hernandez v. FCA US LLC (2020) 50 Cal.App.5th 329, 339)

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies Plaintiff's motion for relief under CCP Section 473(b) to vacate the dismissal of the complaint. The judge finds that the Plaintiff's failure to file a motion for attorney's fees was not due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, but rather a failure to comply with the court's deadline. The judge also notes that the mandatory provisions of CCP Section 473(b) do not apply in this case, as the parties had reached a settlement and the court had provided sufficient time for the Plaintiff to file a motion for attorney's fees. Finally, the judge finds that the Plaintiff's counsel failed to comply with the requirements of the statute by not attaching a copy of the proposed motion for attorney's fees to the attorney declaration submitted in support of the motion.
