On

On

substitution of attorney stating that she was Plaintiff’s new legal
representative. 
On

On
September 7, 2023, Perry informed the Court that all parties except Plaintiff
had signed a release. The Court continued the hearing to allow Plaintiff to
sign the release. 
On
October 31, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to enforce a settlement agreement. 
On
November 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed a substitution of attorney form substituting
himself as a self-represented litigant in place of Perry. 
On
December 18, 2023, Plaintiff withdrew the motion to enforce a settlement
agreement. 
On
December 27, 2023, Perry filed a notice of lien stating that “Wilshire Law Firm
has a lien on this case for attorneys’ fees and costs totaling $181,443.89.” 
On

stay. Spin stated that it filed a voluntary petition for Chapter 11 relief on

the property of the estate . . . .” 
On
March 14, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to enforce settlement, to be heard on

Plaintiff filed an amended motion to enforce settlement without changing the hearing date.  The City filed an objection to
the amended motion.  On April 29, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a response to the objection. 
No
trial date is currently scheduled. 
PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to enforce a settlement agreement. 
The
City asks the Court to deny the motion. 
LEGAL STANDARD                   
Code
of Civil Procedure section 664.6 provides in part: 
“(a) If parties to pending
litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside of the
presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case,
or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms
of the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may retain
jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in
full of the terms of the settlement. 
“(b) For purposes of this section, a writing is signed
by a party if it is signed by any of the following: 
“(1) The party. 
“(2) An attorney who represents the party. 
“(3) If the party is an insurer, an agent who is
authorized in writing by the insurer to sign on the insurer’s behalf.” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subds. (a), (b).) 
In
deciding motions made under section 664.6, courts “must determine whether the
parties entered into a valid and binding settlement.”  (Kohn v. Jaymar-Ruby (1994) 23
Cal.App.4th 1530, 1533.)  On a motion to
enforce a settlement under section 664.6, courts have the power to decide
disputed facts and to interpret the agreement.  (Fiore v. Alvord (1985) 182 Cal.App.3d
561, 566; L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before
Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶¶ 12:977–12:978.5, pp. 12(ll)-139 to 12(ll)-140.) Courts
may receive evidence, determine disputed facts including the terms the parties
previously agreed on, and enter the terms of a settlement agreement as a
judgment, but they may not create new material terms. (Osumi v. Sutton
(2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 1355, 1360.) 
DISCUSSION 
On
April 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed an “amended” motion to enforce settlement,
after the City had filed an opposition to Plaintiff’s original motion and only
seven court days before the hearing on the motion.  Under Code of Civil Procedure section 1005, subdivision
(b), all moving papers must be served and filed at least 16 court days before
the hearing.  Therefore, the “amended”
motion was untimely. 
The
Court continues the hearing on the motion. 
The deadlines to file any opposition or reply will be based on the new
hearing date. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court CONTINUES Plaintiff Daniel Tepper's Motion to enforce settlement to May
29, 2024, at 1:30 p.m. in Department 28 of the Spring Street Courthouse. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
