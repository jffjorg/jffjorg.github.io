And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court denies the petition to approve the compromise of minor Plaintiff Ernesto Arena's claims filed by Petitioner Norma Quintero on April 12, 2024. The court notes that the petition does not clarify the plaintiff's name, which is listed as Ernesto Arenas in the complaint but as Ernesto Arena in the petition. The court also requests more information about Medi-Cal payments that may have been made to the plaintiff. The court finds that the petition does not comply with the legal requirements for approving the settlement of a minor's claims.
