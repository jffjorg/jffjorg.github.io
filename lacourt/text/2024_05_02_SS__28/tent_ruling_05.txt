 Case Number:  21STCV26098    Hearing Date:   May 2, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
July 15, 2021, Plaintiffs Natalie Alvarez (“Alvarez”), Norma Quintero (“Quintero”),
Ricardo Gonzalez-Quintero (“Gonzalez-Quintero”), and Ernesto Arenas filed this
action against Defendants Aftermath Holdings LLC (“Aftermath”), Jordan A.
Rossiter (“Rossiter”), and Does 1-25 for motor vehicle tort and general
negligence. 
On
July 30, 2021, the Court appointed Norma Quintero to serve as guardian ad litem
for Plaintiff Ernesto Arena. 
On
November 17, 2021, Aftermath and Rossiter filed an answer. 
On
August 21, 2023, the Court dismissed Quintero, Alvarez and Gonzalez-Quintero
with prejudice at Plaintiff’s request. 
On
November 6, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a notice of settlement. 
On
April 12, 2024, Petitioner Norma Quintero (“Petitioner”) filed a petition to
approve the compromise of minor Plaintiff Ernesto Arena’s claims, to be heard
on May 2, 2024. 
PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
Norma Quintero asks the Court to approve the compromise of the pending action of
Plaintiff Ernesto Arena. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
“‘[W]ithout
trial court approval of the proposed compromise of the ward’s claim, the
settlement cannot be valid. [Citation.] [¶] Nor is the settlement binding [on
the minor] until it is endorsed by the trial court.’” (Pearson v. Superior
Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338; see Prob. Code, §§ 3500, 3600, et
seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) 
To
obtain court approval of the settlement of a minor’s claims, the petitioner
must file a complete and “verified petition for approval of the settlement and
must disclose ‘all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of
the compromise.’ [Citations.]” (Barnes v. Western Heritage Ins. Co.
(2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 249, 256; see Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.) 
DISCUSSION      
The complaint filed on July 15, 2021 listed Plaintiff’s
name as Ernesto Arenas.  The petition to
approve minor’s compromise identifies him as Ernesto Arena.  Petitioner should clarify Plaintiff’s name
and make sure the complaint and petition are consistent. 
Section 12b(4) of the petition suggests that Medi-Cal
may have paid some of Plaintiff’s medical expenses.  The attached letter from the Department of
Health Care Services states that the department could not find any record of
making payments.  If Petitioner believes
that Medi-Cal paid some of Plaintiff’s medical expenses, Petitioner should
provide information about those payments in the petition. 
The Court denies the petition without prejudice. 
CONCLUSION 
          The Court DENIES without prejudice the petition to approve
the compromise of minor Plaintiff Ernesto
Arena’s claims filed by Petitioner Norma Quintero on April 12, 2024. 
          Petitioner is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
          Petitioner is ordered to file proof of service of this
ruling with the Court within five days.
