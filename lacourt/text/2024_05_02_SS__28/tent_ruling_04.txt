 Case Number:  21STCV18894    Hearing Date:   May 2, 2024    Dept:  28 Having  considered the documents submitted in support of default judgments, the Court  rules as follows.  BACKGROUND  On  May 19, 2021, Plaintiffs Reina R. Garrett (“Garrett”) and William Q. Birky  (“Birky”) filed this action against Defendants Daryl Scot Finley (“Defendant”)  and Does 1-25 for motor vehicle tort and loss of consortium.  On  September 14, 2022, Plaintiffs filed a proof of service showing substituted service on Defendant of statements of damages sought by Garrett and Birky on May 20, 2022.  On  September 22, 2022, the clerk entered Defendant’s default.  On  August 4, 2023, the Court dismissed the Doe defendants without prejudice at  Plaintiffs’ request.  On  April 23, 2024, Plaintiffs filed requests for Court judgment to be heard on  May 2, 2024.  PARTIES’ REQUESTS  Garrett  asks the Court to enter a default judgment against Defendant and award Garrett  $669,595.02, consisting of $500,000.00 in general damages, $168,679.06 in  special damages, and $915.96 in costs.  Birky  asks the Court to enter a default judgment against Defendant and award Birky  $250,400.26, consisting of $250,000.00 in general damages and $400.26 in costs.  LEGAL STANDARD  A.      Default judgment  “[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party  seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry  of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following  must be included in the documents filed with the clerk:  “(1)  Except in  unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties  and the nature of plaintiff's claim;  “(2)   Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment  requested;  “(3)  Interest  computations as necessary;  “(4)  A  memorandum of costs and disbursements;  “(5)  A  declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is  sought;  “(6)  A proposed  form of judgment;  “(7)  A  dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application  for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure  section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment;  “(8)  Exhibits  as necessary; and  “(9)  A request  for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule  3.1800(a).)  B.       Damages   On a request for default judgment, “[w]here a  cause of action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs to introduce  evidence establishing a prima facie case for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice  Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal.  Practice Guide), citing Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357,  361 [trial court erred in applying preponderance of the evidence standard].)   The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry  of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or,  for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the  amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),  585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure  fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27  Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a  default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken  against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is  taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a  right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A  trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the  amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p.  494.)  DISCUSSION  Garrett’s  request for $168,679.06 in special damages is based on (1) $18,679.06 in past  medical expenses and (2) $150,000.00 in future medical expenses for recommended  neck surgery.  (Plaintiffs’ Amended  Default Prove-Up Brief p. 13.)  Garrett’s  statement of damages, however, did not put Defendant on notice that Garrett would  seek $150,000.00 in future medical expenses.   The statement of damages listed “Future medical expenses, according to  proof.”  “The statement [of damages] must  provide actual notice of the nature and amount of damages being sought by the  plaintiff—i.e., the potential liability defendant faces.”  (Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 5:89,  p. 5-31.)  Because Garrett’s statement of  damages did not provide actual notice to Defendant that Garrett was seeking $150,000.00 in special  damages for future medical expenses, the Court cannot award that amount unless Garrett serves a new statement of damages and then obtains a new default.  In  addition, Garrett and Birky each request costs for an investigator.  (Requests for Court Judgment, Section 7.)  If Garrett and Birky wish to recover these  costs, they should explain whether the cost of an investigator is allowable under  Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5.   (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (b)(1) [investigation expenses in  preparing a case for trial are not allowable as costs except when expressly  authorized by law].)    In  the Court’s September 11, 2023 order, the Court found that Garrett and Birky  had not presented sufficient evidence to support their requests for general  damages.  With the new evidence of Garrett’s  recommended neck surgery, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have provided evidence establishing a prima facie case for general damages in the requested amounts. The Court therefore denies the petitions without prejudice based on (1) Garrett's request for special damages (future medical expenses) that were not listed in her statement of damages and (2) Plaintiffs' failure to address whether costs for an investigator are allowable in light of Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivision (b)(1). CONCLUSION  The  Court DENIES without prejudice the application of Plaintiff Reina R. Garrett for default judgment filed on April 23,  2024.  The  Court DENIES without prejudice the application of Plaintiff William Q. Birky  for default judgment filed on April 23, 2024.  Plaintiffs  are ordered to give notice of this ruling.
