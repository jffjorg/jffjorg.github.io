And here is a summary in English text:

This is a Judge's tentative ruling on a request for default judgment in a motor vehicle tort and loss of consortium case. The Plaintiffs, Reina R. Garrett and William Q. Birky, are seeking a default judgment against the Defendant, Daryl Scot Finley. The Court has considered the documents submitted in support of the default judgment and has ruled as follows. The Court finds that Garrett has provided evidence establishing a prima facie case for general damages in the requested amount, but denies the petition for special damages for future medical expenses as the statement of damages did not provide actual notice to the Defendant. The Court also denies the petition for costs for an investigator as the Plaintiffs failed to address whether these costs are allowable under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5. The Court orders the Plaintiffs to give notice of this ruling.
