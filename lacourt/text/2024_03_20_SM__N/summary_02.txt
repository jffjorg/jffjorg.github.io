And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Mikel Rastegar's application for default judgment. The Judge has decided to continue the hearing to a date to be determined, allowing the Plaintiff to submit supplemental evidence. The Judge notes that, as an attorney litigating in propria persona, the Plaintiff cannot recover attorney fees, citing the case of Trope v. Katz (1995) 11 Cal.4th 274, 292. The Judge also requires the Plaintiff to submit a new CIV-100 form and JUD-100 proposed judgment form omitting any request for attorney fees. Additionally, the Judge notes that the Plaintiff's request for costs is unclear, as he has failed to provide evidence of payment, and requires the Plaintiff to submit a new form in line with his supplemental declaration.
