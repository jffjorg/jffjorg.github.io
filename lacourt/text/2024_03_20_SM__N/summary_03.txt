And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants, The Regents of the University of California, Jessica Luchenta, and Robert Weiler, have filed a demurrer to the plaintiff, Jordanne Ho-Shue's, complaint. The plaintiff has not filed an opposition to the demurrer. The court has previously denied the defendants' and Sarah Robertson's special motions to strike every cause of action alleged in the plaintiff's complaint. Sarah Robertson filed a notice of appeal of the court's ruling, but then filed a notice of settlement of appeal, stating that she had settled the appeal, contingent on the grant of a good faith settlement determination by the court. The court finds it prudent to defer ruling on the defendants' demurrer in the interest of judicial economy, taking into account the possibility that an appeal of the court's special motion to strike ruling may be heard and decided. Therefore, the defendants' demurrer is continued to a date to be determined at a hearing for setting only.
