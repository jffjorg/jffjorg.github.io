And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to enforce the settlement agreement reached between the parties. The plaintiff and defendant agreed to a settlement during a mediation session on January 24, 2024, in which the defendant agreed to pay the plaintiff $45,000 in exchange for the plaintiff dismissing the lawsuit. The settlement agreement was signed by the plaintiff and his attorney. The plaintiff has since attempted to dispute the settlement amount, but the judge finds that the requirements for enforcing the settlement under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 664.6 have been met. As a result, the judge orders the plaintiff's counsel to provide his W9 to the defendant's counsel within 10 days for check issuance.
