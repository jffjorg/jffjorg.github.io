Disposition 


REVIEW/CONTINUE 


 



Upon reviewing the Petition, the Court has identified the
following deficiencies:
 
(1)  
Discrepancy in
Negotiated Lien Reductions:
 
The petition states that the “total of
negotiated, contractual, or statutory reductions” is $7,551.96. (MC-350 ¶
12a(3).) 
 
However, the breakdown of the reductions by
each medical service provider indicates the following: (1) $2,945.00 (Precision
Chiropractic Clinic), (2) $550.00 (Integrated Pain Management), (3) $1,400.00
(Woodland Hills Radiology), and (4) $3,478.00 (Providence Holy Cross). These
reductions collectively amount to $8,373.00, which is $821.04 more than the
stated $7,551.96.  
 
This description is not addressed in the petition
and further clarification or correction is necessary.
 
(2)  
Missing
Information
 
The petition does not include the counsel’s
declaration of fees and copy of retainer. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.955(c).)
 
(3)  
Missing Proposed
Order
 
The petition also does not include a proposed
order form MC-351.
 
Accordingly, the
Court requires supplemental information and amended petition papers to address
these deficiencies. A ruling will be issued after Petitioner has had an
opportunity to correct the issues identified above.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Petitioner
Ma De Los Angeles Andrade’s Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim for Diego Jimenez Andrade is CONTINUED
to allow for the submission of additional information or corrections.
 
Moving
party to give notice.
