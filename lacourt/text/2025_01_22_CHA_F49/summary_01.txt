And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted Defendant Christopher Belfour, M.D.'s motion for summary judgment in this medical malpractice action. The motion was filed on October 23, 2024, and the Court has considered the unopposed declarations of expert witness William Park, M.D. Dr. Park testified that the care and treatment provided to Plaintiff Marc Manfro by Defendant Christopher Belfour, M.D. met the standard of care in the community and that no negligent act or omission on behalf of Defendant Christopher Belfour, M.D. caused or contributed to Plaintiff Marc's claimed injuries or damages.

The Court has also granted the motion for summary judgment as to the Second Cause of Action for Loss of Consortium, which was asserted by Plaintiff Theresa Manfro and is dependent on the Cause of Action for Medical Malpractice asserted by her husband, Plaintiff Marc. Since the Court has granted the motion for summary judgment for Marc's Medical Malpractice claim against Defendant Christopher Belfour, M.D., Defendant Christopher Belfour, M.D. cannot be held liable for Theresa's Loss of Consortium claim.

The Court has concluded that the motion for summary judgment was properly granted, and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.
