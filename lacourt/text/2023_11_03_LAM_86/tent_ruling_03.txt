[1] Defendant
argues in its opposition much of the evidence relied upon by Plaintiff to
support its claim is hearsay. (See Opposition 8:2-19.) Defendant did not
specifically object to the evidence. Without specific objections, the court
cannot effectively address Defendant’s evidentiary claims.


[2] It
appears Defendant did not pay Plaintiff at the time “claiming it could not
invoice the Navy until it delivered complete ‘ships’ or ‘ship sets’, which
comprised of a certain number of each of the four parts ordered from [Plaintiff].”
(Id., ¶ 7, Ex. 3.) Defendant’s 2014 communication indicates it would not
pay Plaintiff until it had complete “ship sets.” (Ibid.) Defendant does
not explain its authority to delay payment under the parties’ agreement.  


[3] Defendant
does not explain its ongoing acceptance of and payment for goods delivered to
it by Plaintiff.


[4] Defendant
acknowledged the obligation just days before the United States Navy terminated
its contracts with Defendant. (See St. Pierre Decl. ¶ 9; Choi Decl. ¶ 9.)
Defendant last acknowledged the obligation well after the United States Navy
terminated the contracts. (Choi Decl., Exh. 22 [page 2746] [February 11, 2020 –
Defendant would “start paying back what we owe [Plaintiff] ([Defendant’s]
largest vender debt showing on [its] AP).”)


[5] St.
Pierre does attest the allegations in the cross-complaint are true. (St. Pierre
Decl., ¶ 2.)
