[1] The opposition indicates nominal Defendant, United
Facility Solutions, Inc. (UFS), opposes the motion.  


[2] Myers
does not lay a sufficient foundation for his assertion that “none of alleged
shareholder meetings prior to [Plaintiff’s] confirmation as a shareholder were
properly called or noticed.”  (Myers
Decl. ¶ 7; see Plaintiff’s Evidentiary Objections No. 2.) Nonetheless, for purposes
of this motion, the court need not decide whether the shareholder meetings from
2021 were properly called or noticed.  
 


[3] Defendant Myers is not precluded by this court’s
ruling on a motion for receivership from further developing his contention the
parties reached an oral agreement to dissolve and wind down UFS in future
proceedings in this action. The court’s finding is limited to the evidence
provided for this motion.


[4] In light of this conclusion that corporate dissension
justifies a receivership, the court need not decide whether Myers has engaged
in “mismanagement” or “self-dealing.” 
(See Mot. 20.)
