And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion seeking receivership for United Facility Solutions, Inc. (UFS). The defendant, Myers, has opposed the motion, but the judge has concluded that corporate dissension justifies the appointment of a receiver. The judge does not need to decide whether the shareholder meetings from 2021 were properly called or noticed, as this is not relevant to the motion. Additionally, the judge's finding does not preclude Myers from further developing his contention that the parties reached an oral agreement to dissolve and wind down UFS in future proceedings. The judge has also concluded that it is not necessary to decide whether Myers engaged in "mismanagement" or "self-dealing" for the purpose of this motion.
