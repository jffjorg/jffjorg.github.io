And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the case and has made a tentative ruling. The County's request to rule on affirmative allegations numbers 3-35 is denied. The judge has also disregarded the Petitioner's attempts to incorporate statements of facts and arguments from other documents, as this is not allowed by the court's rules. The judge has also reviewed the administrative record and the briefing, and has determined that the Petitioner failed to exhaust administrative remedies. The court will review the claim as one of a failure to exhaust. The judge has also noted that the case may need to be remanded for further development of facts regarding tolling of the statute of limitations.
