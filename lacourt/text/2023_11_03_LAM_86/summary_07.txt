The Judge also struck Exhibits 25 and 26 and noted that the foundation for Zhan's statements is not specified. The Court ruled that the Plaintiff failed to provide proper notice of an application for a writ of attachment and that the application is based on new evidence that was not provided in a timely manner. The Judge also pointed out that the Plaintiff did not provide sufficient evidence to support their estimated fair market value of the vehicles in question.
