[1] Skelly v. State Personnel Bd. (1975) 15
Cal.3d 194, 218 [Skelly]


[2] Petitioner’s failure to file a
replication to the answer is not dispositive. (Opposition 4:5-21.)  The result here is based on the
administrative record and arguments made in the briefing. Petitioner may
countervail the allegations in the County’s answer at trial. (See Code Civ.
Proc., 
§ 1091. See
also Lotus Car Limited v. Municipal Court, Southern Judicial Dist., San
Mateo County (1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 264, 268. [“Under section 1091 a
petitioner may file a replication denying the affirmative averments of the
answer, or he may controvert them by proof presented by him at the hearing.”])
The County’s request “to rule that affirmative allegations numbers 3-35 are
established at trial” is denied. (Opposition 4:20-21.)


[3] Petitioner states that “[a] detailed summary of the relevant facts . .
. is contained in Petitioner’s [136 page] First Amended Petition, and
Petitioner’s Post Hearing Brief, and are incorporated by reference herein.” (Opening
Brief 3:2-4.) Petitioner also incorporates “argument concerning Beauvais’
erroneous Findings of Fact/Conclusions of Law set forth in Petitioner Gerardo
Lucio’s Objections to Hearing Officer’s Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law
and Recommendation.” (Opening Brief 12:20-23.) The County objects to
Petitioner’s incorporation by reference. (Opposition 4:9-15.) The County’s
objection is well taken and therefore sustained. In this administrative mandate
proceeding, “[t]he parties are subject to the limits of 15 pages for the
opening brief, 15 pages for the opposition, and ten pages for the reply as set
forth in California Rules of Court, rule 3.1113(d), unless a party seeks, and
the court grants, an order for an oversized brief.” (Los Angeles County Court Rules,
Rule 3.231(i).)  “The opening and
opposition briefs must contain a statement of facts which fairly and
comprehensively sets forth the pertinent facts, whether or not beneficial to
that party’s position, and each material fact must be supported by a citation
to a page or pages from the administrative record as follows: (AR 23).” (Id.
at (i)(2).) Petitioner’s attempts to incorporate statements of facts or
arguments from other documents violates the Court’s rules. Accordingly, the
court disregards anything outside of the briefing other than the administrative
record. (See also Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1103, subd. (a)(2) [writ
proceedings heard as law and motion matters].)
 


[4] Petitioner served three additional subpoenas seeking
the same documents from individual Department employees. The Department
challenged those subpoenas as well. (AR 205-209.)  


[5] As there was only one level of administrative review
here by the Commission, the County’s reliance on Sustainability, Parks, Recycling
& Wildlife Defense Fund v. Department of Resources Recycling & Recovery
(2019) 34 Cal.App.5th 676, 696 appears unwarranted. Accordingly, the court
reviews the claim as one of a failure to exhaust.


[6] The November 17, 2020 hearing would have been the
first opportunity after the Commission certified the statute of limitations
issue for hearing; it turned out to be the final hearing date.


[7] It appears four days later, on May 16, 2016, referred the
matter to IAB—a non-criminal investigation—as to Petitioner. (AR 87.)


[8] It appears the hearing officer believed the investigator’s
log did not constitute “evidence in the commonly accepted meaning of the word .
. . .” (AR 443.)


[9] Whether tolling occurred depends on resolution of
conflicting facts. Such facts may, if necessary, be developed on remand.


[10] As noted earlier, Petitioner’s attempt to incorporate
arguments made in other documents from the administrative proceedings have been
disregarded by the court.
