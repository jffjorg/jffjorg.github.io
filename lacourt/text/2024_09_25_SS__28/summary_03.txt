Summary:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling modifies the 11 subpoenas issued by Defendants to limit their application to records reflecting medical treatment of Plaintiff's back, right shoulder, and bilateral knees. The Court grants in part Plaintiff's motion to quash the subpoenas, finding that they are overbroad and seek information that is largely irrelevant to the case. The Court denies the motion in all other respects, allowing Defendants to seek discoverable information related to Plaintiff's injuries.
