PARTY’S REQUESTS 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to quash Defendants’ 11 subpoenas. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 1987.1 provides: 
"(a) If a subpoena requires the attendance of a
witness or the production of books, documents, electronically stored
information, or other things before a court, or at the trial of an issue
therein, or at the taking of a deposition, the court, upon motion reasonably
made by any person described in subdivision (b), or upon the court’s own motion
after giving counsel notice and an opportunity to be heard, may make an order
quashing the subpoena entirely, modifying it, or directing compliance with it upon
those terms or conditions as the court shall declare, including protective
orders. In addition, the court may make any other order as may be appropriate
to protect the person from unreasonable or oppressive demands, including
unreasonable violations of the right of privacy of the person.
"(b) The following persons may make a motion
pursuant to subdivision (a): (1) A party. (2) A witness. (3) A consumer
described in Section 1985.3. (4) An employee described in Section 1985.6. (5) A
person whose personally identifying information, as defined in subdivision (b)
of Section 1798.79.8 of the Civil Code, is sought in connection with an
underlying action involving that person’s exercise of free speech rights." 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.1.) 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 1985.3, subdivision (g), provides in part: 
“(g)  Any
consumer whose personal records are sought by a subpoena duces tecum and who is
a party to the civil action in which this subpoena duces tecum is served may,
prior to the date for production, bring a motion under Section 1987.1 to quash
or modify the subpoena duces tecum. Notice of the bringing of that motion shall
be given to the witness and deposition officer at least five days prior to
production. The failure to provide notice to the deposition officer shall not
invalidate the motion to quash or modify the subpoena duces tecum but may be
raised by the deposition officer as an affirmative defense in any action for
liability for improper release of records. 
* * *
 “No witness or deposition officer shall be required to
produce personal records after receipt of notice that the motion has been
brought by a consumer . . . except upon order of the court in which the action
is pending or by agreement of the parties, witnesses, and consumers affected. .
. .” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1985.3,
subd. (g).) 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 1987.2, subdivision (a), provides: 
“(a) Except as specified in subdivision (c), in making
an order pursuant to motion made under subdivision (c) of Section 1987 or under
Section 1987.1, the court may in its discretion award the amount of the
reasonable expenses incurred in making or opposing the motion, including
reasonable attorney’s fees, if the court finds the motion was made or opposed
in bad faith or without substantial justification or that one or more of the
requirements of the subpoena was oppressive.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.2,
subd. (a).) 
For
discovery purposes, information is relevant if it might reasonably assist a
party in evaluating the case, preparing for trial, or facilitating settlement.
(Gonzalez v. Superior Court (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1539, 1546.) 
When
a party seeks discovery which impacts a person’s constitutional right to
privacy, limited protections come into play. (Shaffer v. Superior Court (1995)
33 Cal.App.4th 993, 999.) The protections cover a person’s personal and
financial matters. (Ibid.) The court must balance competing rights — the
litigant’s right to discover relevant facts and the individual’s right to
maintain reasonable privacy — in determining whether the information is
discoverable. (Ibid.) 
“
‘[W]hile the filing of a lawsuit may implicitly bring about a partial waiver of
one’s constitutional right of associational privacy, the scope of such “waiver”
must be narrowly rather than expansively construed, so that plaintiffs will not
be unduly deterred from instituting lawsuits by the fear of exposure of their
private associational affiliations and activities.’ [Citation.] Therefore, . .
. an implicit waiver of a party’s constitutional rights encompasses only
discovery directly relevant to the plaintiff’s claim and essential to the fair
resolution of the lawsuit.” (Vinson v. Superior
Court (1987) 43 Cal.3d 833, 842; see ibid. [“On
occasion [a party's] privacy interests may have to give way to [the] opponent's
right to a fair trial. Thus courts must balance the right of civil litigants to
discover relevant facts against the privacy interests of persons subject to
discovery”].) 
“[A]lthough
in seeking recovery for physical and mental injuries plaintiffs have
unquestionably waived their physician-patient and psychotherapist-patient
privileges as to all information concerning the medical conditions which they
have put in issue, past cases make clear that such waiver extends only to
information relating to the medical conditions in question, and does not
automatically open all of a plaintiff's past medical history to scrutiny.” (Britt
v. Superior Court (1978) 20 Cal.3d 844, 849 (Britt) [trial court
erred by placing “absolutely no limit on defendant's efforts to obtain
wholesale disclosure of each plaintiff's lifetime medical history”].)
“[P]laintiffs are ‘not obligated to sacrifice all privacy to seek redress for a
specific [physical,] mental or emotional injury’; while they may not withhold
information which relates to any physical or mental condition which they have
put in issue by bringing this lawsuit, they are entitled to retain the
confidentiality of all unrelated medical or psychotherapeutic treatment they
may have undergone in the past.” (Id. at p. 864, fn. omitted.) 
“Even
when discovery of private information is found directly relevant to the issues
of ongoing litigation, it will not be automatically allowed; there must then be
a careful balancing of the compelling public need for discovery against the
fundamental right of privacy. [Citation.] The scope of any disclosure must be
narrowly circumscribed, drawn with narrow specificity, and must proceed by the
least intrusive manner. [Citation.]” (Davis v. Superior Court (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1008, 1014.) 
DISCUSSION 
A.   The complaint 
The
complaint alleges the following: 
On July
8, 2022, at or near the intersection of Century Boulevard and Normandie Avenue
in Los Angeles, Defendants negligently operated, owned,
and entrusted a motor vehicle, and employed persons who operated the motor vehicle
in the course of their employment, injuring Plaintiff. 
Defendants negligently and carelessly serviced,
repaired, maintained, inspected, owned, entrusted, and operated Defendant’s
vehicle, causing Plaintiff’s injuries. 
Defendant violated Vehicle Code section 22350 in operating
the motor vehicle, causing the incident and Plaintiff's injuries and damages.  Plaintiff's damages include past and future
pain and suffering/ emotional distress; past and future loss of earnings; past
and future loss of earning capacity; past and future medical expenses; past and
future health care expenses; past and future incident expenses; and past and future
household services.

May 31, 2024, Defendants served eleven subpoenas for Plaintiff’s records on (1)
Tower Orthopaedics & Sport Medicine, (2) Tower Orthopaedics & Sport

specify with particularity the information Defendant needs.”  However, the motion does not discuss the
specific language of any subpoena.

 C.   Plaintiff’s motion to quash 
Plaintiff
argues that Defendants’ subpoenas are overbroad, seek information “largely irrelevant” to the case, and violate his privacy
rights.  Plaintiff asks the Court to
limit the subpoenas to Plaintiff’s “injuries to his back, right shoulder, and
bilateral knees.”
 D.   Analysis
The
Court has considered Plaintiff’s arguments and weighed Plaintiff’s privacy
rights against Defendants’ right to seek discoverable information.  The Court concludes that the subpoenas are overbroad to the extent that they request records concerning body parts in
addition to Plaintiff’s back, right shoulder, and bilateral knees. 
The
Court modifies the subpoenas to limit their application to records reflecting
medical treatment of Plaintiff’s back, right shoulder, and bilateral knees. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS in part Plaintiff Tony
Lavelle Baker’s motion to quash subpoenas issued by Defendants Edgar Molina
Lopez and Zuly Franco Corado to Tower Orthopaedics & Sport Medicine (2
subpoenas), Rajan Patel, M.D. (2 subpoenas), PeteHealth (2 subpoenas), Abraham
Golbari, M.D. (2 subpoenas), Martin Luther King Jr. Community Hospital-Meds, Martin
Luther King Jr. Community Hospital-bills, and Kemper Independence Insurance
Company-1.  The Court modifies the
subpoenas to limit their application to records reflecting medical treatment of
Plaintiff’s back, right shoulder, and bilateral knees.  In all other respects, the Court DENIES the
motion. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
