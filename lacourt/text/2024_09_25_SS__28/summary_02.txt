And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the documents submitted in support of the request for default judgment against Danilo Velozo. The plaintiff, Ian Nel, seeks a default judgment against Velozo and is asking for $1,677,807.27 in damages. However, the judge has denied the application for default judgment because the plaintiff failed to provide proof of service of the summons on Velozo and the proofs of service by mail do not comply with the relevant California statutes. The judge has also vacated the default judgment entered on April 5, 2024. The plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
