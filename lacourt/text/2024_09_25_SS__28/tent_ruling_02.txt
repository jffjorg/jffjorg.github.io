judgment, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
May 20, 2022, Plaintiff Ian Nel (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
Defendants Edward Matias (“Matias”) and Does 1-20 for strict liability under
Civil Code section 3342. 
On
June 16, 2022, Matias filed an answer. 
On
August 11, 2022, Plaintiff amended the complaint to include Defendant Danilo
Velozo as Doe 1 (“Velozo”). 
On
August 30, 2022, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing personal service on
Velozo of the summons, complaint, and other documents on August 28, 2022. 
On
September 30, 2022, the clerk entered Velozo’s default. 
On
October 16, 2022, Plaintiff personally served a statement of damages on Velozo.
(Baruch dec. 6/8/23 ¶ 5 & exhs. E, F.) The statement of damages listed
$500,000.00 for pain and suffering, $500,000.00 for emotional distress,
$250,000.00 for disfigurement, $100,000.00 in past medical expenses, and an

On

On
June 22, 2023, Velozo filed a notice of appeal. On August 10, 2023, the Court

order. On November 6, 2023, the Court of Appeal dismissed Velozo’s appeal. On
January 25, 2024, the Court of Appeal issued the remittitur. 
On
July 24, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s request to file a first amended
complaint adding a second cause of action for negligence against Matias,
Manwarren, and Does 3-20. The Court granted the request based on a stipulation
between Plaintiff, Matias, and Manwarren. 
On
July 26, 2023, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint. The amended complaint
alleged a claim for strict liability under Civil Code section 3342 against
Matias, “Doe 1 Danilo Velozo,” “Doe 2 Joel Manwarren,” and Does 3-20.  It alleged a negligence claim against Matias,
"Doe 2 Joel Manwarren," and Does 3-20. 
On
August 17, 2023, Matias and Manwarren filed an answer to Plaintiff’s first
amended complaint. 
On March
5, 2024, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing service by mail of the
first amended complaint on Velozo on January
10, 2024. 
On
March 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing service by mail of
the statement of damages on Velozo on December 28, 2023. 
On
March 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed a notice of partial settlement with Matias and
Manwarren. 
On
March 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed proofs of service showing service by mail of
the first amended complaint and statement of damages on Velozo on January 10,
2024 and December 28, 2023, respectively. 
On April 5, 2024, the clerk entered Velozo’s default. 
On
May 8, 2024, the Court dismissed Matias, Manwarren, and Does 3-20 with
prejudice at Plaintiff’s request. 
On August
15, 2024, Plaintiff filed an application for default judgment against Velozo. 
PARTY’S REQUESTS 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to enter a default judgment against Velozo and award Plaintiff $1,677,807.27,
consisting of $1,250,000.00 in general damages, $167,656.08 in special damages,
$259,903.61 in interest, and $247.58 in costs. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
          California Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a), provides: 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not
sought or an application for separate judgment against specified parties under
Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each
judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
 The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry
of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or,
for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a
default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken
against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is
taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a
right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A
trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the
amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p.
494.) 
DISCUSSION 
          Plaintiff has not filed proof of service of the summons on Velozo.  
In
addition, the proofs of service by mail of the complaint and statement of
damages do not comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 415.30 (service by
mail) or Code of Civil Procedure section 425.11, subdivision (d)(2) (service of
statement of damages on a party who has not appeared in the action). 
          Because Plaintiff has not satisfied the conditions for entry
of default, the Court vacates the April 5, 2024 default and denies Plaintiff’s
application for default judgment against Velozo. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES Plaintiff Ian Nel’s application for default judgment against
Defendant Danilo Velozo filed on August 15, 2024.  In addition, the Court VACATES the default of
Defendant Danilo Velozo entered on April
5, 2024. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
