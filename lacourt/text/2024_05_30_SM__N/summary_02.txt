And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court grants in part Plaintiff Erin Hughes' motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint. The court finds that Plaintiff has demonstrated good cause to allow the proposed amendments regarding the purported cause of the fire being the release of sky lanterns. However, the court denies the motion in all other respects, finding that Plaintiff has failed to meet the procedural requirements set forth in California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324 as to the proposed third and fourth causes of action. The court also notes that Plaintiff's delay in bringing the motion prejudices the adverse party, who would be required to start litigating two new claims from scratch nearly three years after starting litigation.
