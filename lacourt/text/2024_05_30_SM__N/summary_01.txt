And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has decided to continue the hearing to a date to be determined. The petitions filed by Michael Dahan and Michael Nathan to approve the compromise of pending actions involving their children, Leo Dahan, Ayden Dahan, and Aviel Nathan, are continued due to deficiencies in the petitions. Specifically, the court lacks medical records documenting the injuries and treatment of Aviel Nathan, and the requested 40% attorney fee is unclear. The court requires medical documentation of the injuries and treatment before the petitions can be approved. Additionally, the court is uncertain about the basis for awarding a 40% attorney fee and requests that counsel provide a basis for this request.
