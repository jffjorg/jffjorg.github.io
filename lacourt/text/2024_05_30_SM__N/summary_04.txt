And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Kraig Hill, moves to strike the complaint pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16, alleging that the plaintiff's claims arise from protected activity. The court grants the motion, finding that the defendant's letter criticizing the property's development is protected speech under the anti-SLAPP statute.

The court finds that the defendant has satisfied the first prong of the anti-SLAPP statute, that the plaintiff's claims arise from protected activity. The court also finds that the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on the merits of their claims.

The court concludes that the defendant's letter was privileged as a communication made by an interested person to another interested person without malice. The court further concludes that the plaintiff has failed to provide admissible evidence showing that the defendant's statements were false, and that the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate pecuniary loss as a result of the defendant's letter.

Accordingly, the court grants the defendant's special motion to strike the complaint, and the defendant is entitled to recover his reasonable attorney's fees and costs.
