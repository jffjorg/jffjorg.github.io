And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants the plaintiff's motion for attorneys' fees in the amount of $59,375.00. The plaintiff's counsel sought fees incurred in enforcing the settlement agreement, which provides for the prevailing party to receive attorneys' fees and costs incurred after the agreement's execution. The defendants' counsel objected to the motion, citing various grounds, including the lack of contemporaneous time records and vague summaries of work performed by the plaintiff's counsel. However, the court found that the defendants' counsel did not provide sufficient evidence to support their objections and therefore granted the plaintiff's motion.
