  Case Number:  23STCV05044    Hearing Date:   April 24, 2024    Dept:  74 April Netus
v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, et al.
Defendant Noor Staffing Group LLC’s
Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to Form Interrogatories (Employment) and
Request for Sanctions.
 
BACKGROUND 
            This
action arises from an employment dispute.
            On
March 7, 2023, Plaintiff April Netus (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against
Defendant Noor Staffing Group (Defendant) and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
            On
September 24, 2023, Defendant served Plaintiff with form interrogatories
(employment). 
            After
multiple extensions, Plaintiff’s counsel failed to provide timely responses.
            On
March 15, 2024, Defendant filed this motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to
the form interrogatories and request for sanctions.
LEGAL STANDARD
¿¿            If
a party to whom interrogatories or an inspection demand were directed fails to
serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
responses without objections. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (b),
2031.300, subd. (b).) Moreover, failure to timely serve responses waives
objections to the requests. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300,
subd. (a).) Failure to verify a response is equivalent to no response at all. (Appleton
v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.)  
DISCUSSION  
            The
court grants this motion because Plaintiff has failed to provide timely
responses to the form interrogatories. Because Plaintiff lacked substantial
justification for her failure to respond, sanctions are necessary. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).) Defendant’s counsel’s proposed hourly rate is
reasonable, and she has provided a breakdown of work performed. (Marko Decl., ¶
7.) 
CONCLUSION 
The
court grants Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff responses to form
interrogatories (employment). Plaintiff shall provide Code-Compliant responses
without objections within 30 days of this order. The court grants Defendant’s
counsel’s request for sanctions. Plaintiff shall pay Defendant’s counsel
attorney fees in the sum of $1,050 within 30 days of this order.
Defendant
shall give notice.///////////April Netus
v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, et al.
Defendant Noor Staffing Group LLC’s
Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to Requests for Production of Documents
(Set One) and Request for Sanctions.
 
BACKGROUND 
            This
action arises from an employment dispute.
            On
March 7, 2023, Plaintiff April Netus (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against
Defendant Noor Staffing Group (Defendant) and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
            On
September 24, 2023, Defendant served Plaintiff with requests for production of
documents (set one) (RFPs).
            After
multiple extensions, Plaintiff’s counsel failed to provide timely responses.
            On
March 15, 2024, Defendant filed this motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to
the RFPs and request for sanctions.

¿¿            If
a party to whom interrogatories or an inspection demand were directed fails to
serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
responses without objections. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (b),

            The
court grants this motion because Plaintiff has failed to provide timely
responses to the RFPs. Because Plaintiff lacked substantial justification for
her failure to respond, sanctions are necessary. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300
subd. (c).) Defendant’s counsel’s proposed hourly rate is reasonable, and she
has provided a breakdown of work performed. (Marko Decl., ¶ 7.) However, this
motion largely duplicates Defendant’s other motion to compel. The court will
adjust the award accordingly.
CONCLUSION 
The
court grants Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to the requests
for production (set one). Plaintiff shall provide responsive documents and
Code-compliant responses without objections within 30 days of this order. The
court grants Defendant’s counsel’s request for sanctions. Plaintiff shall pay
Defendant’s counsel attorney’s fees in the sum of $330 within 30 days of this
order.
Defendant
shall give notice.
