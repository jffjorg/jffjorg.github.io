 Case Number:  24NNCV00590    Hearing Date:   October 31, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER OVERRULING DEFENDANT  DEMURRER TO PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT and GRANTING DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO STRIKEI.         INTRODUCTION Plaintiff Dennis Quoc-Binh Pham-Lu  (“Plaintiff”) commenced this action against Defendant McWong Holding Company  (“Defendant”) alleging multiple causes of action arising from alleged  construction defects in the property located at 414 E. Lemon Avenue, Arcadia,  CA (“the Property”). Plaintiff alleges four causes of action: (1) Breach of  Implied Covenant to Perform Work in a Good and Competent Manner, (2) Breach of  Contract, (3) Breach of Implied Duty to Perform with Reasonable Care, and (4)  Violations of Standards Enumerated Under Civil Code § 896 et seq. (the  California Right to Repair Act). On June 21, 2024, Defendant filed a  demurrer with a motion to strike the first three causes of action, arguing that  Plaintiff failed to state sufficient facts and that these claims are barred by  the California Right to Repair Act. Defendant also contends that Plaintiff  cannot maintain a breach of contract claim because there is no direct contract  between Plaintiff and Defendant. On October 18, 2024, Plaintiff  filed an Opposition to Defendant’s demurrer, arguing that the California Right  to Repair Act does not preclude the claims and that sufficient facts have been  pled to establish third-party beneficiary status for the breach of contract  claim. On the same day, Plaintiff filed a notice of non-opposition to  Defendant’s motion to strike.   Meet and Confer Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure  section 430.41, subdivision (a), the demurring party is required to meet and  confer with the party who filed the pleading at least five days before the  responsive pleading is due. This must occur in person, telephone or by video  conference with the aim of resolving any objections raised in the demurrer.  Additionally, the demurring party must file and serve a declaration detailing  the meet and confer efforts. It should be noted, however, that the failure to  meet and confer is not itself grounds for sustaining or overruling a demurrer  or granting or denying a motion to strike. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, subd.  (a)(4), 435.5, subd. (a)(4).) Here, Defense counsel sent a  meet-and-confer letter via email on May 1, 2024. (Demurrer, pg. 5). Emails were  exchanged between counsel, and the parties held a telephone conference on June  11, 2024. (Demurrer, pg. 5). During these discussions, Plaintiff’s counsel  declined to dismiss the first, second, and third causes of action, but both  parties agreed to extend Defendant’s deadline to file its Demurrer and Motion  to Strike to June 21, 2024. (Demurrer, pg. 5; Bubion Decl. ¶ 2). Accordingly,  the Court finds that Defendant has satisfied the meet-and-confer requirement  under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41. II.        LEGAL STANDARD A demurrer tests the legal  sufficiency of a complaint. Donabedian v.  Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994. A plaintiff’s allegations  must be accepted as true for purposes of demurrer, no matter how “improbable”  they are. (Del E. Webb Corp. v.  Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604 (Del E. Webb).) Allegations need not be  accepted as true if they are contradicted by judicially noticeable facts. (Cansino v. Bank of America (2014) 224  Cal.App.4th 1462, 1474.)  Pleadings are to be broadly  construed (Code Civ. Proc., § 452) and demurrers are to be overruled where the  facts are sufficient to state any cause of action. (Quelimane Co. v. Stewart  Title Guaranty Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 38.) Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (f)  provides for a demurrer where a pleading is uncertain. Demurrers for  uncertainty are disfavored and are only sustained where a pleading is so incomprehensible  a defendant cannot reasonably respond. (A.J. Fistes v. GDL Best Contractors,  Inc. (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 677, 695; Khoury v. Maly’s of California (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)  An action for injury to real  property is subject to a three-year statute of limitations under Code of Civil  Procedure section 338(b). In tort cases, the statute of limitations generally  begins to run upon the occurrence of the last essential event, even if the  plaintiff is unaware of the cause of action. (Wilshire Westwood Associates  v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 732, 739). In the case of  injury to property, the injury is considered to be to the property itself, not  the property owner (Ibid.) The discovery rule postpones the  accrual of a cause of action until the plaintiff discovers, or has reason to  discover, the cause of action (Fox v. Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. (2005)  35 Cal.4th 797, 807). Under the rule, a plaintiff has reason to discover a  cause of action when they have reason to suspect a factual basis for its  elements. Suspicion of wrongdoing, coupled with knowledge of any remaining  elements, triggers the statute of limitations period (Ibid.). The  discovery rule only delays accrual until the plaintiff has, or should have,  inquiry notice of the cause of action (Ibid.). However, Plaintiff must  specifically plead facts showing (1) the time and manner of discovery and (2)  the inability to have made earlier discovery despite reasonable diligence. The  burden is on the plaintiff to show diligence, and conclusory allegations will  not withstand demurrer (Fox v. Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc., supra,  35 Cal.4th at p. 808).   III.      ANALYSIS Defendant demurs to the first three  causes of action in Plaintiff's Complaint (1) Breach of Implied Covenant to  Perform Work in a Good and Competent Manner, (2) Breach of Contract, and (3)  Breach of Implied Duty to Perform with Reasonable Care—arguing that Plaintiff  has failed to state sufficient facts to support these claims. Defendant does  not demur to the fourth cause of action for violations of Civil Code § 896 et  seq. (the California Right to Repair Act).   First cause of action: Breach  of Implied Covenant to Perform Work in a Good and Competent Manner. The elements of breach of implied  covenant of good faith and fair dealing are:  (1) existence of a contractual  relationship; (2) implied duty; (3) breach; and (4) causation of damages. Smith  v. San Francisco, 225 Cal.App.3d 38, 49 (1990).  “Every contract imposes  on each party an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.”  Egan v.  Mutual of Omaha Ins. Co., 24 Cal.3d 809, 818 (1979).  Breach of the  covenant of good faith and fair dealing is a form of breach of contract action.  The same elements apply, but the breach is not of an express term of the  contract but rather an implied term necessary to protect the reasonable  expectations and purposes of the contracting parties as to the express terms of  the contract.  Carma Developers, Inc. v. Marathon Development California,  Inc., 2 Cal.4th 342, 373 (1992). Here, Plaintiff alleges that  Defendant, as the builder of the Property “failed to build the Property free  from Defects” (Complaint ¶ 26). And that Plaintiff suffered harm because of  Defendant’s conduct (Complaint P 27). Plaintiff further lists defects in  Paragraph 17 of the complaint to include 23 defects. Further, Plaintiff alleges  that “Plaintiff believes around May 2021, Defendant had a contract with the  owner of the Property to build a brand-new home at the property specifically  for sale to a third-party beneficiary such as Plaintiff.” (Complaint ¶ 13.) This  allegation demonstrates that Plaintiff has alleged the existence of the  contract between Defendant and the owner, and that he is the third-party  beneficiary of that contract.  Defendant argues that Plaintiff has  failed to provide sufficient details regarding the alleged contract between  McWong and the prior owner. Specifically, Defendant points out that Paragraph  13 of the Complaint vaguely states that McWong had a contract with the property  owner, but it lacks crucial details such as the date, scope, and terms of the  contract. Defendant contends that Plaintiff is asserting contract-based claims  without adequate knowledge of the contract’s existence or terms.  The Court finds that the  allegations in the Complaint are sufficient to state a cause of action for  Breach of the Implied Covenant to Perform Work in a Good and Competent Manner.  Plaintiff has adequately alleged the existence of a contractual relationship  (albeit as a third-party beneficiary), an implied duty to perform competently,  and the breach of that duty through the various construction defects listed in  the Complaint, such as faulty installation of windows and water damage.  While Defendant argues that the  first and third causes of action are duplicative, the Court finds that the  claims are sufficiently distinct to survive demurrer. The first cause of action  focuses on the breach of an implied contractual duty, while the third cause of  action deals with negligence and the breach of a duty of care inherent in  construction work. The Court also finds that the lack  of specific details about the contract does not warrant sustaining the  demurrer. Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts at this stage to indicate the  existence of a contract. Plaintiff is not required to allege every specific  term of the contract in the complaint. (“In an action based on a written  contract, a plaintiff may plead the legal effect of the contract rather than  its precise language.” Construction Protective Services, Inc. v. TIG  Specialty Ins. Co. (2002) 29 Cal. 4th 189,198-199.) The Court OVERRULES Defendant’s  demurrer as to the first cause of action.  Second cause of action: Breach of Contract. The elements for a cause of action  for breach of contract are: (1) existence of contract; (2) plaintiff’s  performance or excuse for nonperformance; (3) defendant’s breach (or anticipatory  breach); and (4) resulting damage. (Wall Street Network, Ltd. v. N.Y. Times  Co. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1171, 1178.)  In order for a plaintiff to allege  breach of contract as a third-party beneficiary, the plaintiff must plead a  contract that was made expressly for his benefit. (See Martin v. Bridgeport  Community Association, Inc. (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 1024, 1034.) A third  party need not be named or identified individually to be an express beneficiary  and a third party may enforce a contract where he shows that he is a member of  a class of persons for whose benefit it was made. (See Spinks v. Equity  Residential Briarwood Apartments (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1004,  1023.)   As discussed above, Plaintiff has  alleged in the complaint that Defendant McWong entered into a contract with the  developer-owner of the Property to construct a new home, which was to be sold  to third-party beneficiaries like Plaintiff. (Complaint, ¶ 13). Plaintiff  further alleges that as a third-party beneficiary under the  builder-developer/owner contract, he entered into an agreement with Defendant  for the construction of the Property. (Complaint, ¶ 29). Additionally,  Plaintiff claims that Defendant failed to build the Property free from defects,  as required under its contract with the owner, and that this failure caused  Plaintiff to suffer damages. (Complaint, ¶¶ 32-33). Defendant argues that Plaintiff has  failed to allege sufficient facts to support the existence of a contract  between Defendant and the prior owner. Defendant asserts that Paragraph 13 of  the Complaint merely provides a vague and conclusory statement regarding the  existence of a contract, without including key details such as the date, scope,  or specific terms of the agreement. Defendant contends that Plaintiff’s lack of  specific knowledge about the contract’s terms should preclude him from  asserting contract-based claims, as Plaintiff has not demonstrated a factual  basis to establish the contract’s existence or its applicability to him. As discussed above, the Court finds  that Plaintiff’s allegations are sufficient to support the existence of a  contract for the purposes of pleading. The Complaint alleges that Defendant  entered into a contract with the developer-owner to construct a new home  intended for sale to third-party beneficiaries like Plaintiff. Under Civil Code  § 1559, a third-party beneficiary may enforce a contract if the contract was  expressly made for their benefit. Plaintiff’s allegations that he was a member  of the intended class of beneficiaries, and that Defendant breached its  obligations by failing to address construction defects, are sufficient to  survive demurrer at this stage. While Defendant argues that  Plaintiff lacks specific knowledge about the terms of the contract, Plaintiff  is not required to plead every term with specificity at the pleading stage. A  general allegation of the contract’s existence, especially when based on  information and belief, is sufficient to support a cause of action for breach  of contract, as further details can be explored during discovery. The  allegations here reasonably support the inference that Plaintiff, as the  purchaser of the Property, was an intended third-party beneficiary of the  construction contract between Defendant and the developer-owner. For the foregoing reasons,  Defendant’s demurrer to the second cause of action is OVERRULED.    Third cause of action: Breach of Implied Duty to Perform  with Reasonable Care  “Accompanying every contract is a  common-law duty to perform with care, skill, reasonable expedience, and  faithfulness the thing agreed to be done, and a negligent failure to observe  any of these conditions is a tort, as well as a breach of the contract.” The  rule which imposes this duty is of universal application as to all persons who  by contract undertake professional or other business engagements requiring the  exercise of care, skill and knowledge; the obligation is implied by law and  need not be stated in the agreement [citation].’ [Citation.]” (Holguin v.  Dish Network LLC (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 1310, 1324. Plaintiff alleges that the contract  between Defendant McWong and the developer-owner for the construction of the  Property implied that the work would be performed competently and with  reasonable care. (Complaint, ¶ 35) Plaintiff also alleges that Defendant failed  to use reasonable care in building the Property to be free from defects, and  that Defendant breached this implied condition. (Complaint, ¶¶ 35, 39)  Plaintiff further claims that he performed all conditions required under the  contract or was excused from doing so, and that McWong’s failure to use  reasonable care caused harm to Plaintiff. (Complaint, ¶¶ 38-40). Defendant argues that the First and  Third Causes of Action are duplicative, as both allege that there is an implied  covenant to provide materials and workmanship in a competent manner. Defendant  contends that there is no substantive difference between the two causes of  action, as both involve the same alleged failure to construct the Property free  from defects. Moreover, Defendant argues that  Plaintiff’s allegations regarding the contract are vague and conclusory.  Paragraph 13 of the Complaint only briefly mentions that Defendant had a  contract with the owner to build the Property, without providing specifics such  as the date, scope, or terms of the contract. Defendant asserts that Plaintiff  lacks sufficient knowledge of the contract’s terms to support a breach of  contract or implied duty claim. Plaintiff contends that while both  the First and Third Causes of Action relate to the Construction Contract, they  are distinct in nature. The First Cause of Action focuses on a breach of the  implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which is part of every  contract, while the Third Cause of Action specifically addresses Defendant’s  negligent performance of its duties under the contract. Plaintiff argues that  Defendant’s failure to perform with reasonable care, leading to various  defects, is a separate claim that should not be dismissed as duplicative.  Plaintiff also asserts that pursuing both claims will not prejudice Defendant  or negatively impact judicial economy, as they involve overlapping witnesses  and evidence, and both relate to the same contractual obligations. The Court finds that Plaintiff has  sufficiently alleged a cause of action for Breach of Implied Duty to Perform  with Reasonable Care. While Defendant argues that the First and Third Causes of  Action are duplicative, the Court concludes that they are distinct. The First  Cause of Action concerns the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,  while the Third Cause of Action pertains specifically to the negligent  performance of Defendant’s duties under the contract. The duty to perform with reasonable  care is implied in all contracts for services, including construction  contracts. (North American Chemical Co. v. Superior Court (1997) 59  Cal.App.4th 764, 774). Plaintiff has alleged specific defects and damages  resulting from Defendant’s failure to perform competently, which is sufficient  to state a claim for breach of the implied duty of care. Additionally,  Plaintiff is not required to plead every specific detail of the contract at  this stage, and the allegations provide a reasonable inference that Plaintiff,  as the third-party beneficiary, was harmed by Defendant’s failure to perform  its obligations with reasonable care. Accordingly, Defendant’s demurrer  to the third cause of action is OVERRULED.    Motion to strike The court may, upon a motion, or at  any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any  irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading. (Code Civ.  Proc., § 436(a).) The court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not  drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an  order of the court. (Id., § 436(b).) The grounds for a motion to strike are  that the pleading has irrelevant, false, or improper matter, or has not been  drawn or filed in conformity with laws. (Id. § 436.) The grounds for moving to  strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice.  (Id. § 437.) Defendant moves to strike portions  of Plaintiff’s Complaint. Defendant argues that Plaintiff failed to allege  sufficient facts to support the claim for “any and all costs or fees  recoverable by contract or statute” because no contract or statute is cited in  the Complaint. As a result, Defendant seeks to strike Prayer for Relief No. 7  as to the first, second, third, and fourth causes of action, found on Page 12  of the Complaint. Additionally, Defendant contends that Plaintiff’s request for  “attorney’s fees where allowed” must also be stricken, as Plaintiff has not  identified any contract or statute supporting the claim for attorney’s fees.  Therefore, Defendant seeks to strike Prayer for Relief No. 2 as to all causes  of action, also located on Page 12 of the Complaint. In response, Plaintiff filed a  Notice of Non-Opposition to the motion to strike, agreeing to remove the  contested prayers for relief. Plaintiff specifically agrees to strike Prayer  for Relief No. 7 as to the first, second, third, and fourth causes of action,  as well as Prayer for Relief No. 2 as to all causes of action. A copy of the  Complaint, reflecting these agreed changes, was attached as Exhibit A to  Plaintiff’s Notice of Non-Opposition. Given Plaintiff’s non-opposition,  the Court grants Defendant’s motion to strike the following: Prayer for Relief  No. 7 as to the first, second, third, and fourth causes of action, and Prayer  for Relief No. 2 as to all causes of action. Accordingly, these portions are  ordered stricken from the Complaint.   IV.       ORDER                        The Court OVERRULES  the demurrer.                Defendant's  motion to strike is GRANTED in whole.                        Defendant is to file its answer within 20 days of this order.             Defendant is to give notice.      Dated: October 31, 2024                                                                                         JARED D.
