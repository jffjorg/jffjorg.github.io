The judge has reviewed the default judgment packet submitted by the plaintiff, Mar Center LLC, and has granted the request for entry of default judgment in the amount of $513,888.38. The plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendants, Meiping Peng, Xijun Liu, and Jianan Zhou, for breach of a commercial lease agreement. The plaintiff claims that the defendants failed to pay rent and CAM charges, resulting in damages of $505,211.27. The plaintiff also claims attorney's fees and costs of $6,932.11 and $1,745, respectively. The judge noted discrepancies between the amounts requested in the Written Statement and the CIV-100 form, and therefore relied on the amounts specified in the CIV-100 form. The plaintiff provided exhibits showing the lease, lease amendments, and a ledger detailing the amounts owed. The judge granted the default judgment, finding that the plaintiff's efforts to re-let the premises were reasonable.
