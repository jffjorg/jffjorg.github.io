 Case Number:  23AHCV01600    Hearing Date:   October 31, 2024    Dept:  P ORDER RE DEFAULT JUDGMENTThe Court has reviewed the default judgment packet
submitted by Plaintiff, Mar Center LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
(“Plaintiff”), on July 7, 2024.
On July 12, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint against
Defendants Meiping Peng, Xijun Liu, and Jianan Zhou, individually and doing
business as Xiang Cuisine, for breach of a commercial lease agreement. Default
was requested and entered on June 26, 2024.
The Court notes discrepancies between the amounts in
the CIV-100 form and those requested in the Written Statement in Support of the
Application for Judgment. The Court therefore relies on the amounts specified
in the CIV-100 form.
Plaintiff seeks a default judgment totaling
$513,888.38, which includes $505,211.27 in unpaid rent and CAM charges,
$6,932.11 in attorney’s fees, and $1,745 in costs ($435 in clerk filing fees,
$430 in process server fees, and $880 in publication fees).
Plaintiff provided Exhibits A–D, which include copies
of the lease, lease amendments, and a lease ledger detailing amounts owed. The
damages calculation is based on unpaid rent from April 1, 2020, through May 1,
2023. (Written Statement, pg. 5). Additionally, Plaintiff claims efforts to
re-let the premises, including online listings on loop.net, and posting signs
on the premises and around the shopping center complex. (Lu Decl., ¶ 7).
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s request for entry of default
judgment is GRANTED in the amount of $513,888.38.
Plaintiff is to give notice.Dated: October 31, 2024 JARED D. MOSES  JUDGE OF THE SUPERIOR COURT
