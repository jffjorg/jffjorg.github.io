And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories. The case is about a plaintiff, Chuan Tang, who claims that FCA US LLC and Puente Hills Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram failed to adequately resolve issues with his vehicle, a 2022 Dodge RAM 3500, despite numerous repair attempts under warranty. The plaintiff filed a motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories, which was opposed by FCA.

The judge notes that the meet and confer requirement has been met, but finds that FCA's responses to Form Interrogatory No. 12.1 are insufficient. The judge denies the motion to compel further responses to Interrogatory No. 12.1.

The judge grants the motion to compel further responses to Interrogatory No. 15.1, which requests detailed information for each denial and affirmative defense, including specific facts supporting each position.

The judge also grants the motion to compel further responses to Interrogatory No. 17.1, which asks FCA to confirm if each response to the plaintiff's requests for admission is an unqualified admission.

The judge orders FCA to provide further responses to Interrogatory No. 15.1 and No. 17.1 within 40 days of the order. The plaintiff is to give notice.
