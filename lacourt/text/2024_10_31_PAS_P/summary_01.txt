And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied Plaintiff Diana Cuamea's request for monetary sanctions against Defendants BP RE Management LLC and Zhimin Li, as well as former counsel Farhad Novian of Novian & Novian LLP. The Court found that Plaintiff's allegations of discovery misuse by Defendants and former counsel did not rise to the level of egregious conduct required to warrant sanctions. Additionally, the Court found that both former counsel and current counsel acted in good faith and did not engage in willful discovery misuse.

Former counsel had requested sanctions against Plaintiff for lack of civility, citing a letter requesting withdrawal of the Motion and a dismissive response from Plaintiff's counsel. However, the Court found that there was no explicit showing of malice or intent by Plaintiff's counsel in filing the motion, and therefore denied the request for sanctions.

The Court also denied Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions, finding that the alleged conduct did not constitute the extensive and egregious conduct displayed in the City of Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP.
