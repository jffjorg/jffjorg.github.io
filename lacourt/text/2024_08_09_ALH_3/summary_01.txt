As for the summary text, the Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion for summary judgment filed by the defendants, Haig Chiropractic Corp., P.C., HLC Health Corp. aka The Joint Chiropractic, and Vincent S. Manfre, D.C. The ruling is based on the arguments presented by the defendants and the lack of a competent competing expert declaration from the plaintiff, Jesus Tucker.

As a result, the motion for summary judgment is granted and the case will proceed no further.
