And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case 24STCV01118. The case involves a Motion to Strike filed by the Defendant, Continental Currency Services, Inc., seeking to strike the phrase "and the Unruh Civil Rights Act" from the Complaint filed by the Plaintiff, Dwain Lammey.

The Judge grants the Motion to Strike and strikes the phrase "and the Unruh Civil Rights Act" from page 9, lines 6-7 of the Complaint.

The Judge also concludes that the Unruh Civil Rights Act does not authorize affirmative injunctive relief, such as the removal of presently existing architectural barriers, unless required by other laws. The Judge notes that the Unruh Civil Rights Act has broad preventive and remedial purposes, but the Legislature has given explicit clarifications as to what type and manner of injunctive relief is available.

The Judge's ruling is based on the California Civil Code, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and other relevant laws and regulations. The case will proceed with the remaining allegations and claims.
