  - "Given that service appears not to have occurred, the Court will quash the proof of service."
  - "Given that no abstract of judgment or writ of execution has issued (and, presumably, no property has been levied according to such abstracts of judgments or writs of execution), the rest of the requested relief is unripe."

English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Motion to Quash Service of Notice of Entry of Sister-State Judgment and Recall and Quash Writs of Execution and Abstracts of Judgment. The Motion to Quash is granted in part, and the Proof of Service filed on November 15, 2023 is quashed. The Motion to Quash is denied as unripe as to all other issues. The Court finds that service was not properly made, as nobody was at the defendant's home when service was attempted. The plaintiff's claims that they are willing to grant the defendant a longer period to respond to the entry of the sister-state judgment are not relevant to the issue of service. The Court will quash the proof of service and deny the rest of the requested relief as unripe.
