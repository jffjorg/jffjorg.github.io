And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Uber's motion to compel Patricio Harris to respond to discovery requests, including form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents. The judge found that Harris was properly served with the discovery requests, but failed to respond in a timely manner, waiving any objections he may have had. The judge has ordered Harris to serve verified responses to the discovery requests within 20 days.

The judge has also deemed Uber's motion to deem Requests for Admission Admitted moot, as Harris provided objection-free responses to the requests.

Finally, the judge has ordered Uber to pay an additional filing fee, as the company combined two separate motions into one, which is not allowed.
