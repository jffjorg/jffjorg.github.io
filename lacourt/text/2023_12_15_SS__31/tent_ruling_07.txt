Background On November 17, 2023, The Regents of The University of California (“Regents”) and CDC Madison Lomita LLC filed the instant motion to compel Plaintiff Eva Mayes (“Plaintiff”) to appear for her deposition thirty days from the hearing date. Preliminary, the Court notes that Plaintiff filed a request for dismissal of Regents on November 21, 2023, which was entered on November 22, 2023. Therefore, the motion as it pertains to Regents is moot, and the Court will only address arguments as it relates to CDC Madison Lomita LLC (“Defendant”).  The first four deposition notices were noticed by Regent only. (Mot. Exhs. A-D.) Defendant joined in the latter amended deposition notices, namely the fifth amended notice setting Plaintiff’s deposition for August 9, 2023, and sixth amended notice setting the deposition for August 28, 2023. (Mot. Exhs. E-F.) Defendant contends Plaintiff’s counsel agreed to produce Plaintiff for her deposition. However, Defendant was notified the day before the deposition that Plaintiff would not appear. Only Plaintiff’s counsel appeared for the sixth noticed deposition on August 28, 2023, and Defendant obtained a certificate of non-appearance.  Any opposition was due on or before December 4, 2023; none was filed.   II. Motion to Compel Deposition CCP § 2025.450(a) provides, “If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that is a party under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent's attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.”  CCP § 2025.450 requires the Court to compel the deposition unless it finds a valid objection was served under §2025.410. There is no evidence that Plaintiff served any valid objections to the deposition notices, and Plaintiff did not oppose this motion demonstrating otherwise. Further, there is no evidence that Plaintiff’s deposition has proceeded since the filing of the instant motions.  Therefore, the unopposed motion to compel is GRANTED. (CCP § 2025.450(a).) Accordingly, Plaintiff is ordered to appear for her deposition at a date, time, and location to be noticed by Defendant. Defendant must give at least ten days’ notice of the deposition (notice extended per Code if by other than personal service).  III. Sanctions CCP § 2025.450(g)(1) requires the court to impose sanctions unless it finds the deponent acted with substantial justification or there are circumstances that render imposition of sanctions unjust. Defendant request $6,964.84 in connection with the instant motion. A court has discretion to award sanctions that are “suitable and necessary to enable the party seeking discovery to obtain the objects of the discovery he seeks” but they should not be punitive in nature or levied for the purposes of punishing an offending party. (Vallbona v. Springer (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1525, 1545.)   The Court awards Defendant $500 total for the motion and to appear at the hearing as attorney’s fees. Additionally, Defendant is awarded the certificate of non-appearance for the August 28, 2023 deposition only in the amount of $572.36, and one motion filing fee of $60, for a total of $632.36 as costs. Sanctions are imposed against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel. Plaintiff and/or Plaintiff’s counsel are ordered to pay sanctions to Defendant, by and through counsel of record, in the total amount of $1,072.36 within twenty (20) days.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 14th day of December 2023      Hon.
