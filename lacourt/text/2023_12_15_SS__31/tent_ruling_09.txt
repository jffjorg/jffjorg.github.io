 Case Number:  22STCV19523    Hearing Date:   December 15, 2023    Dept:  31 SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA  FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES - CENTRAL DISTRICT  JOSE MORALES, Plaintiff(s),  vs.  JOSE NOYOLA, ET AL.,  Defendant(s). ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )       CASE NO: 22STCV19523  [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE MOTIONS TO COMPEL AND MOTION TO DEEM ADMISSIONS ADMITTED  Dept. 31 1:30 p.m.  December 15, 2023  I. Motion to Compel Plaintiff Jose Morales (“Plaintiff”) propounded special interrogatories, set one, on Jose Noyola (“Defendant”) on August 16, 2023. After not receiving responses, Plaintiff’s counsel sent a meet and confer letter. On October 20, 2023, defense counsel stated they would provide responses on October 23, 2023. However, to date, no responses were served.  Plaintiff therefore seeks an order compelling Defendant to respond, without objections, to the outstanding discovery and to pay sanctions. The motion is unopposed.  However, the Court denies the motion without prejudice due to Plaintiff’s defective service of the moving papers. The proof of service does not demonstrate that the motion was served on Defendant’s associated counsel of record, James P. Souza and Anthony T. Luebke, Esq. of Kennedy & Souza, APC.  Based on the foregoing, the motion to compel responses to special interrogatories is denied without prejudice.  II. Motion To Deem Admitted Plaintiff propounded requests for admissions (“RFAs”), set one, on Defendant on August 16, 2023. Defendant did not provide responses, and therefore Plaintiff seeks his RFAs, set one, to be deemed admitted against Defendant. The motion is unopposed.  However, for the same reasons as above, the service of the papers is defective because it does not affirmatively demonstrate that defense co-counsel was served with the motion. Furthermore, the motion identified in the proof of service is materially different from the instant motion. The proof of service provides, “NOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION FOR COURT ORDER TO COMPEL DEFENDANT JOSE NOYOLA RESPONSES TO ADMISSIONS, SET ONE AND FOR MONETARY SANCTIONS” whereas the actual motion is not a compel, but instead a “NOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION TO DEEM ADMITTED THE REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION, SET ONE AND FOR MONETARY SANCTIONS.”  Based on the foregoing, the motion to deem RFAs admitted is denied without prejudice.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 14th day of December 2023      Hon.
