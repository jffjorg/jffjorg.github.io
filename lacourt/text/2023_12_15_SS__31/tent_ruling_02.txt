Motions to Compel Defendant Uber Technologies, Inc. (“Uber”) propounded form interrogatories, set one, and special interrogatories, set one, and request for production of documents (“RPDs”), set one, on Plaintiff Patricio Harris (“Harris”) on August 10, 2023. Responses were due on or before September 13, 2023. Uber’s counsel granted Plaintiff Harris’ request for an extension up to September 27, 2023 to provide discovery responses. Responses were not served. Uber avers it attempted to meet and confer with Plaintiff’s counsel on October 2, 2023, and October 10, 2023, but to date no verified objection-free responses have been provided. Uber therefore seeks an order compelling Plaintiff Harris to respond, without objections, to the outstanding discovery.  As of December 4, 2023, the motions are unopposed.  For a motion to compel discovery responses, all a propounding party must show is that it properly served its discovery requests, that the time to respond has expired, and that the party to whom the requests were directed failed to provide a timely response. (See Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905 906.) Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §2030.290, §2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails to serve timely responses waives any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection of attorney work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a); §2031.300, subd. (a).)    On December 7, 2023, Uber filed a notice of non-opposition, and provides that Plaintiff Harris did provide untimely verified responses to the propounded discovery on November 17, 2023, after the motions were filed. However, Uber contends that the responses included objections, which have been waived due to the untimeliness of the responses. Plaintiff Harris does not oppose the motions arguing otherwise. Therefore, because the evidence shows Plaintiff Harris was properly served with discovery and failed to timely respond, thereby waiving all objections, Uber’s motions are GRANTED. Plaintiff Harris is ordered to serve verified responses to Uber’s form interrogatories, set one, and special interrogatories, set one, and RPDs, set one, without objections, within twenty (20) days. (CCP § 2030.290 (a),(b); §2031.300 (a),(b).)  II.  Motion to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted On August 10, 2023, Uber served on Plaintiff Harris its request for admission (“RFAs”), set one. After receiving no responses, Uber filed the instant motion to deem RFAs admitted against Plaintiff Harris on October 11, 2023.  On November 14, 2023, Plaintiff Harris filed an opposition, declaring that he has provided verified and objection free responses to Uber’s RFAs, set one.  In reply, Uber concedes that Plaintiff did provide responses. Therefore, the Court finds the motion moot.  (Cal. Code Civ. Proc §2033.280(c); St. Mary v. Superior Court (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 776.)  Uber argues that it should be allowed to include additional evidence and admissions received from the late discovery responses in Uber’s motion for summary judgment. However, the Court will not consider arguments raised for the first time on reply. Accordingly, Uber’s motion to deem RFAs, set one, admitted against Plaintiff Harris is moot.   III.  Additional Filing Fees The Court notes that Uber filed a single motion for what should have been two separate motions as to the motions to compel form interrogatories and special interrogatories, set one. Combining discovery motions allows the moving party to avoid paying the requisite filing fees. Filing fees are jurisdictional and it is mandatory for court clerks to demand and receive them. (See Duran v. St. Luke’s Hospital (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 457, 460.) Thus, Uber is ordered to pay one additional filing fee. This ruling will be final upon proof of payment of the filing fee.  Moving Defendant is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 14th day of December 2023      Hon.
