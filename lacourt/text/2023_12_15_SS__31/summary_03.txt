And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to deny without prejudice the motion of Beau M. Goodrick, Esq. to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Daniel Palacios. The motion is based on an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. However, the court finds that the motion is defective because it was filed by Goodrick, who is not the attorney of record for the Plaintiff, and because the moving papers were not properly served on the Plaintiff at a confirmed address. The court orders Goodrick to give notice and to file a copy of the signed return receipt if and when the appropriate attorney of record for the Plaintiff refiles the motion. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and must submit to the tentative ruling by email or appear at the hearing on December 15, 2023.
