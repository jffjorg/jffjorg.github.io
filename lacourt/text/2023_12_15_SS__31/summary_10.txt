And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a motion to quash a subpoena for medical, billing, and radiological records. The motion was filed by the plaintiff, Ermine Taymazyan, who was injured in a trip and fall on the defendant's property. The defendant, Sun Real Estate Investments, LLC, issued subpoenas to 15 of the plaintiff's treating providers, but the plaintiff objected to the subpoenas and proposed limiting their scope. After the defendant withdrew the subpoenas and re-issued them with a limited scope, the court finds the issue now moot and orders the moving party to give notice. The court also encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and warns that if all parties do not submit or appear at the hearing, the court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the court.
