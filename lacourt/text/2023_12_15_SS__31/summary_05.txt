And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the petition to approve the compromise of pending action of a minor, Leo Flores, due to defects in the petition. The petition proposes a settlement of $19,000, with $500 apportioned to the minor, but the court is unclear about the disposition of the funds. The court notes that the petitioner's 19b(5) provides for delivery of the funds to the minor's parent, but the declaration of counsel provides for deposit into an insured account at Wells Fargo Bank. The court has previously identified this issue and is requiring the petitioner to correct the defects and file a new petition at least 9 court days before the continued hearing date.
