And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiffs' request for default judgment against the Defendants, Hien Duc Vo and Kimthu Thi Tran. The Plaintiffs, who are the surviving parents of the Decedent, Aaron Jia Shyang Tsao, are seeking $4,000,000 in damages for the wrongful death of their son. However, the judge finds that the Plaintiffs have not provided sufficient specificity on the damages claimed, and that the damages claimed are primarily based on grief and sorrow, which are not recoverable under California law.

The judge recommends that the Plaintiffs correct these defects and submit a new default judgment package by a certain date. Failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal. The judge has continued the OSC (Order to Show Cause) re entry of default judgment to a later date.
