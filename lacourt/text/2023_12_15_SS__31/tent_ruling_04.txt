(Mot. Decl. Reiland ¶ 3; Exh. A.) Responses were due on or before February 24, 2023. (Id. at ¶ 4.) To date, Plaintiff has not provided responses. Defendant therefore seeks an order deeming its RFAs, set one, to be admitted against Plaintiff. However, thereafter, Defendant filed a reply providing that Plaintiff served responses. Therefore, the Court finds the motion moot.  (Cal. Code Civ. Proc §2033.280(c); St. Mary v. Superior Court (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 776.)   Defendant requests monetary sanctions be imposed because Plaintiff served responses three months after the filing of the instant motion. Where a party fails to provide a timely response to requests for admission, “[i]t is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  Defendant is awarded 1 hour to prepare the motion and 1 hour to appear at the hearing, at the requested rate of $195 per hour, for a total of $390 in attorney’s fees. Further, Defendant is awarded one motion filing fee of $60, as costs.     Sanctions are imposed against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel.
