 Case Number:  21STCV00460    Hearing Date:   December 15, 2023    Dept:  31 DEPT:  31 HEARING DATE: 12/15/2023 CASE NAME/NUMBER: 21STCV00460 MARIA L. SERRANO, et al. vs JOSE ARTURO HERNANDEZ, et al. PETITION TO APPROVE COMPROMISE OF PENDING ACTION OF A MINOR LEO FLORES, Age 8 RECOMMENDATION: Deny for reasons stated below.  TENTATIVE¿ ¿ The Court excuses the personal appearance of Claimant and the guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by telephone or video conference call.¿  Plaintiffs have agreed to settle their claims against Defendant for the total amount of $19,000, with $500 being apportioned to Leo Flores (“Claimant”). If the settlement is approved, the entirety of the $500 apportioned to Claimant will be transferred to a custodian for the benefit of the minor under the California Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (“CUTMA”).  However, a gift made pursuant to this CUTMA is held in custodianship until age 18 unless the gift specifies a termination age beyond 18, but not over 25 years of age.   Petitioner’s 19b(5) provides that the $500 will be delivered directly to Claimant’s parent, to be used in Claimant’s best interest, which does not correspond with the item marked. Further, the declaration of counsel confusingly provides that the $500 will be deposited into an insured account at Wells Fargo Bank.  This issue was previously identified on July 17, 2023, in which Petitioner had marked 19b(5), yet also provided that the proposed amount was to be transferred into a blocked account.   The Court remains unclear as to the disposition of the funds. If Petitioner is actually proposing to transfer the proposed funds to Wells Fargo Bank for the benefit of Claimant, Petitioner must mark item 19b(2), provide an Attachment 19b(2), and file an Order to Deposit Funds In Blocked Account (MC-355) together with the petition.  ¿ Petitioner must reserve a new date and file a new petition curing the above-noted defects at least 9 court days before the continued hearing date.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.
