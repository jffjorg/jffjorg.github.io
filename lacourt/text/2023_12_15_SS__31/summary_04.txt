And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Chad Tewksberry vs. TJX Inc, ET AL, and Marshalls of CA, LLC. The defendant, Marshalls of CA, LLC, propounded requests for admissions on January 20, 2023, and the plaintiff failed to respond. The defendant then filed a reply stating that the plaintiff had served responses, making the motion to deem admissions admitted moot. The judge finds that the plaintiff's failure to provide timely responses necessitated the motion and imposes monetary sanctions on the plaintiff and their counsel. The defendant is awarded attorney's fees and costs, and the plaintiff and their counsel are ordered to pay sanctions to the defendant. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if a party intends to submit to the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court.
