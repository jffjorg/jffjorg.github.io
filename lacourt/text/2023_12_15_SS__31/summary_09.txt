And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses two motions: a motion to compel discovery and a motion to deem admissions admitted. The motion to compel discovery was filed by Plaintiff Jose Morales, who propounded special interrogatories and requests for admissions to Defendant Jose Noyola on August 16, 2023. The Defendant did not respond, and Plaintiff's counsel sent a meet and confer letter. However, the Court denied the motion without prejudice due to defective service of the moving papers. The Court also denied the motion to deem admissions admitted for the same reason. The Court notes that the proof of service does not demonstrate that the motion was served on Defendant's associated counsel of record. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if a party intends to submit to this tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number.
