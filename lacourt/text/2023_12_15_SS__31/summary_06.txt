And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The City of Gardena has moved for an order requiring Plaintiff Brenton Lamar Griffin to post an undertaking in the sum of $62,515. The City alleges that Plaintiff is a nonresident of California and that there is a reasonable possibility that the City will obtain a favorable judgment. The City has submitted evidence showing that Plaintiff is a resident of Indiana and has been for the past five years. The City also alleges that Plaintiff was unlicensed and uninsured at the time of the accident and that Plaintiff's actions contributed to the accident.

The Judge has denied the City's motion, finding that the City has not submitted substantial evidence to meet its burden. The Judge notes that the City's evidence does not demonstrate a reasonable likelihood of a defense verdict. The Judge also notes that the City's allegations of Plaintiff's negligence are not sufficient to establish a reasonable possibility of success in the action.

The Judge has ordered the City to give notice of the denial of its motion. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement on the issue. If a party intends to submit on the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court.
