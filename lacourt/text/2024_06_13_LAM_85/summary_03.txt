**Case Number:** 23STCV22693

**Case Summary:**

This is a tentative ruling in a lawsuit between World Tech Toys, Inc. (WT23) and Straight Forwarding, Inc. (SFI). SFI is seeking a right to attach order against WT23 in the amount of $1,559,863.69.

**Facts:**

* WT23 and SFI entered into a credit application and agreement in March 2019 for SFI to arrange transportation of WT23's shipments from Asia to the United States.
* SFI invoiced WT23 for its services, including air and ocean transportation, customs clearance, and other ancillary services.
* WT23 failed to pay SFI for many of the invoices, and SFI continued to deliver shipments to WT23 despite the outstanding balance.
* In 2021, SFI began to withhold shipments and impose additional shipping costs and storage fees without a contractual basis.
* WT23's attempts to negotiate a payment plan and release of containers were unsuccessful.

**Procedural History:**

* Plaintiff WT23 filed a complaint against SFI in July 2022.
* Defendant SFI filed a cross-complaint against WT23 in December 2022.
* The court has taken evidence from both parties and has considered the parties' arguments.

**Applicable Law:**

* Attachment is a prejudgment remedy that allows a plaintiff to seize a defendant's assets to aid in the collection of a money demand pending the outcome of the trial of the action.
* To obtain a right to attach order, the plaintiff must show that the claim on which the attachment is based is one on which an attachment may be issued, the plaintiff has established the probable validity of the claim, the attachment is sought for no purpose other than the recovery on the subject claim, and the amount to be secured by the attachment is greater than zero.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the evidence and arguments presented by both parties, the court finds that SFI has failed to establish the probable validity of its claim and the amount to be secured by the attachment. The court therefore denies SFI's application for a right to attach order against WT23.
