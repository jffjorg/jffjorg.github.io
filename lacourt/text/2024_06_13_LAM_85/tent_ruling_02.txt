Garcia’s 14-page reply exceeds the ten-page limit of CRC 3.1113(d).  The court has exercised its discretion to
consider only the first ten pages.


[2]
All further statutory references are to the Government Code unless otherwise
stated. 


            [3]
The Legislature has confirmed that the 2023 changes in recodifying the CPRA
were not intended to substantively change the law relating to inspection of
public records.  §7920.100.


[4] Petitioner
Garcia requests the court to judicially notice the following documents: (1)
LAPD Risk Management and Legal Affairs Division, CPRA Manual (Ex. F); (2)
Senate Committee on Appropriations’ analysis of SB 1421 (2018-2019 Reg. Sess.) (Ex.
X); (3) motion for exclusion of testimony filed in on July 20, 2022 in Case No.
G194418 (Ex. Y); (4) Los Angeles Times news article dated April 25, 2017 (Ex. Z);
(5) settlement agreement filed on April 2017 in Case No. BS169474 (Ex. AA);
(6); minute order issued on December 11, 2019 in Case No.
37-2019-00005450-CU-WM-CTL (Ex. BB); (7) order granting petition for mandate
issued on April 7, 2021 in Case No. RG20071657 (Ex. CC); and (8) Policy No. 296
in LAPD Manual Vol. IV (Ex. DD).  The
City objects to each request.
Exhibits F, Ex, and DD are judicially noticed.  Evid. Code §452(b), (c).  The requests for the remaining exhibits (Exs.
Y, Z, AA, BB, CC) are denied due to lack of relevance and/or are because they
cannot be considered for the truth of their content.  


[5]
The parties improperly cite the CPRA’s former codification rather than its
current form.  The court has endeavored
to cite the correct statutes.


[6]
LAPD has redacted complaints that are confidential under Penal Code section 832.7.  Rush Decl., ¶¶ 35, 36. The redactions include
names, addresses, and phone numbers of victims, including victim businesses
pursuant to Penal Code
section 832.7(b)(6), information pertaining to unrelated officers pursuant
to Penal Code section
832.7(b)(5), and information subject to the personal privacy exemption.  Id.


[7] LAPD
withheld certain records as exempt.  Penal
Code section 832.7(a) provides that personnel records of peace officers and
records of complaints maintained by a local agency such as LAPD are
confidential and exempt from disclosure, unless they fall within the categories
of incidents specifically delineated in subdivision (b). Records that did not
fall within one of the categories of records expressly made non-confidential
pursuant to Penal Code section
832.7(b) remain confidential and non-disclosable under Penal Code section
832.7(a) and have not been produced. 
Opp. at 13.  Garcia also sought
autopsy photographs which LAPD determined were not disclosable pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Code
section 129 and Penal
Code section 832.7(b)(6)(C) and (b)(7). 
Opp. at 13-14.  Garcia does not
dispute either exemption.
