 Case Number:  23STCV22693    Hearing Date:   June 13, 2024    Dept:  85 
World
Tech Toys, Inc. v. Straight Forwarding, Inc., 23STCV22693

Tentative decision on application
for right to attach order:  denied




 



Defendant/Cross-Complainant Straight Forwarding, Inc. (“SFI”)
applies for right to attach order against Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant World
Trading 23, Inc. (“WT23”). 
The court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition,
and reply, and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
A. Statement of
the Case
1. First Amended Complaint
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant WT23, commenced this action on July
14, 2022.  The operative pleading is the
First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), filed on March 21, 2024, against Defendant/Cross-Complainant
SFI, alleging causes of action for: (1) breach of contract; (2) reformation of
contract based upon illegality; (3) conversion; (4) intentional interference
with contractual relations; (5) intentional interference with prospective
economic relations; (6) money had and received; and (7) declaratory relief.  The FAC alleges in pertinent part as follows.
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant WT23 and
Defendant/Cross-Complainant SFI entered into a Credit Application and Agreement
(“Agreement”) on or about March 22, 2019 for SFI to organize WT23’s shipments
from the manufacturer to WT23’s point of delivery.  FAC ¶¶15, 17, Ex. A.  
On or about February 2022, SFI began to hold WT23’s
shipments and refused to allow delivery of those shipments to WT23.  FAC ¶25. 
SFI also imposed shipping costs and storage fees for those shipments
without a contractual basis.  FAC
¶25.  SFI refused to allow WT23 to move
and store the containers at its own storage facilities so as to avoid the need
to incur the shipping charges and storage fees. 
FAC ¶27. 
In March 2022, WT23 expressly advised SFI in writing to stop
importing any more containers and SFI continued to do so anyway.  FAC ¶28.
In or about May 2022, SFI advised WT23 that it would allow
the release of individual containers if WT12 agreed to pay shipping charges and
a per-container premium that would go towards paying down the outstanding
balance purportedly owed.  FAC ¶29.  WT23 reluctantly agreed to pay the shipping
charges and per-container premium for 15 containers and SFI released those
containers.  FAC ¶30.
On June 29, 2022, WT23 send a demand letter to SFI stating that
WT23 would be willing to pay the shipping charges for all containers being
improperly held if SFI released them immediately.  FAC ¶31. 
SFI insisted that release of the containers would require payment of the
shipping charges and a per-container premium until all outstanding balances
were paid.  FAC ¶31.
On July 6, 2022, SFI transferred some of WT23’s containers
to the Port of Long Beach and the Federal Maritime Commission (“FMC”) for
storage.  FAC ¶32.  WT23 is now incurring demurrage and detention
charges for several thousands of dollars per container per month and reputation
risk as a shipper of intentional goods. 
FAC ¶32.  On July 7, 2022, SFI
reiterated its refusal to release any of the containers unless WT23 paid all
outstanding balances purportedly owed and advised that it would no longer pay
the storages costs and would allow the storage facility to auction the contents
of the containers.  FAC ¶33.
WT23 is still being denied access to at least 32 containers,
including certain toys and goods with an estimated value of $6 million that
need to be shipped to third-party retailers by July 2022.  FAC ¶34.
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant WT23 seeks (1) compensatory
damages in the amount of at least $500,000, (2) consequential damages in the
amount of at least $500,000, (3) disgorgement of all fees and other charges
paid by WT23 to which SFI was not legally or contractually entitled, (4) treble
damages for goods unlawfully retained and stolen by SFI, (5) punitive damages,
(6) reformation of the Agreement, (7) declaratory relief under the Agreement,
(8) interest of 10% from the date of filing of the FAC, (9) reasonable
attorney’s fees and costs, and (10) such other and further relief deemed just
and appropriate by the court.  FAC, pp.  13-14.
 
2. Cross-Complaint
On December 2, 2022, Defendant/Cross-Complainant filed a
Cross-Complaint against WT23 and World Tech Toys, Inc. (“WTT”), alleging causes
of action for breach of contract, goods and services rendered, and account
stated.  The Cross-Complaint alleges in
pertinent part as follows.
In or about March 2019, WTT and WT23 approached SFI to
request that SFI arrange the transportation of WTT's merchandise from Asia to
various destinations in the United States. 
X-Compl. ¶7.
In connection with this request, WT23 executed the Agreement,
which sets forth SFI's terms and conditions of service.  X-Compl. ¶8, Ex. A.  In the Agreement, WT23 requested a credit
limit of $ 100,000 and credit terms of NET 30 days. X-Compl. ¶9. By e-mail
dated April 3, 2019, SFI approved the Agreement, subject to a credit limit of $
30,000 and credit terms of NET 30 days. X-Compl. ¶10.
Between April 2019 and August 2021, Cross-Defendants hired
SFI to arrange transportation of over 75 shipments of WTT's merchandise from
Asia to the United States.  For each of
these shipments, SFI arranged for air transportation, ocean transportation
and/or customs clearance at the place of delivery without incident.  X-Compl. ¶11.
At all times between April 2019 and August 2021, the outstanding
balance owed by Cross-Defendants to SFI for these 9 services remained below the
agreed upon $ 30,000 credit limit. Therefore, SFI invoiced Cross-Defendants for
these services under the credit terms of NET 30 days (payment due within 30
days of the date of invoice), pursuant to the terms of the Agreement. X-Compl.
¶12. 
Between August and October 2021, Cross-Defendants hired SFI
to arrange transportation for approximately 40 more 16 shipments of WTT's
merchandise from Asia to the United States. SFI's fees for services provided
for these shipments (including fees advanced by SFI on Cross-Defendants' behalf)
were in excess of $ 500,000.  X-Compl. ¶13.

In or about October 2021, SFI informed Cross-Defendants that
the unpaid fees exceeded the agreed upon $30,000 credit limit, and that
Cross-Defendants' payment for all pending and future shipments would be due
upon delivery, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement.  X-Compl. ¶14. 
Between October 2021 and January 2022, the approximately 40
shipments of WTT's merchandise for which SFI had arranged ocean transportation
were delivered to marine terminals in the California.  Cross-Defendants picked up some of these
containers from the marine terminals. Cross-Defendants were unable to pick up
some of these containers because they refused to pay SFI's invoiced freight and
related charges.  X-Compl. ¶15
In or about January 2022, Cross-Defendants requested that
SFI find warehouse storage for the container loads that were stuck at the
marine terminals, and for other container loads of which Cross-Defendants had failed
to take immediate delivery.  X-Compl. ¶16.
In January and February 2022, at the request of Cross-Defendants,
SFI arranged for the warehouse storage of approximately 17 container loads of
WTT's merchandise. Between January and July 2022, an additional four containers
loads of WTT's goods were sent by the terminal to a general order warehouse due
to WTT's failure to take delivery of the containers.  X-Compl. ¶17.
Between October 2021 and the present, SFI sent numerous
invoices and account statements to Cross-Defendants for services provided by
under the Agreement, including ocean freight charges, air freight charges,
handling charges, customs charges, and storage charges.  X-Compl. ¶18.
Cross-Defendants have failed and refused to pay for services
provided by SFI under the Agreement.  To
date, these outstanding charges exceed $1,100,000.  X-Compl. ¶19.
Cross-Complainant SFI prays for judgment in its favor in an
amount to be proven at trial, an award of court costs and attorney fees,
interest as allowed by contract or law, and such other relief as the court may deem
just and proper.  X-Compl., pp. 8-9.
 
3. Course of Proceedings 
On July 20, 2022, Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant WT23 filed an ex
parte application for an order to show cause and temporary restraining
order.  The matter was taken off calendar
the same day.
On November 14, 2022, the court overruled Defendant/Cross-Complainant
SFI’s demurrer and denied its motion to strike.
On December 2, 2022, Defendant/Cross-Complainant SFI filed its
Answer and Cross-Complaint.
On January 10, 2023, Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant WT23 filed
its Answer to Cross-Complaint.
On April 22, 2024, Defendant/Cross-Complainant SFI filed its
Answer to the FAC. 
 
B. Applicable Law
Attachment is a
prejudgment remedy providing for the seizure of one or more of the defendant’s
assets to aid in the collection of a money demand pending the outcome of the
trial of the action.  See Whitehouse
v. Six Corporation, (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 527, 533.  In 1972, and in a 1977 comprehensive
revision, the Legislature enacted attachment legislation (CCP §481.010 et seq.)
that meets the due process requirements set forth in Randone v. Appellate
Department, (1971) 5 Cal.3d 536.  See
Western Steel & Ship Repair v. RMI, (12986) 176 Cal.App.3d 1108,
1115.  As the attachment statutes are
purely the creation of the Legislature, they are strictly construed.  Vershbow v. Reiner, (1991) 231
Cal.App.3d 879, 882.
A writ of attachment
may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for money, each of which
is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the total amount of the
claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount not less than five hundred
dollars ($500).  CCP §483.010(a).  A claim is “readily ascertainable” where the
amount due may be clearly ascertained from the contract and calculated by
evidence; the fact that damages are unliquidated is not determinative.  CIT Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v.
Super DVD, Inc., (“CIT”) (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 537, 540-41
(attachment appropriate for claim based on rent calculation for lease of
commercial equipment).
All property within
California of a corporation, association, or partnership is subject to
attachment if there is a method of levy for the property.  CCP §487.010(a), (b).  While a trustee is a natural person, a trust
is not.  Therefore, a trust’s property is
subject to attachment on the same basis as a corporation or partnership.  Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn &
Rossi v. Wilson, supra, 197 Cal.App.3d at 4.
The plaintiff may
apply for a right to attach order by noticing a hearing for the order and
serving the defendant with summons and complaint, notice of the application,
and supporting papers any time after filing the complaint.  CCP §484.010. 
Notice of the application must be given pursuant to CCP section 1005,
sixteen court days before the hearing.  See
ibid.
The notice of the
application and the application may be made on Judicial Council forms (Optional
Forms AT-105, 115).  The application must
be supported by an affidavit showing that the plaintiff on the facts presented
would be entitled to a judgment on the claim upon which the attachment is
based.  CCP §484.030.  
Where the defendant
is a corporation, a general reference to “all corporate property which is
subject to attachment pursuant to subdivision (a) of Code of Civil Procedure
Section 487.010” is sufficient.  CCP
§484.020(e).  Where the defendant is a
partnership or other unincorporated association, a reference to “all property
of the partnership or other unincorporated association which is subject to
attachment pursuant to subdivision (b) of Code of Civil Procedure Section 487.010”
is sufficient.  CCP §484.020(e).  A specific description of property is not
required for corporations and partnerships as they generally have no exempt
property.  Bank of America v. Salinas
Nissan, Inc., (“Bank of America”) (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 268.
A defendant who
opposes issuance of the order must file and serve a notice of opposition and
supporting affidavit as required by CCP section 484.060 not later than five
court days prior to the date set for hearing. 
CCP §484.050(e).  The notice of
opposition may be made on a Judicial Council form (Optional Form AT-155).  
The plaintiff may
file and serve a reply two court days prior to the date set for the
hearing.  CCP §484.060(c). 
At the hearing, the
court determines whether the plaintiff should receive a right to attach order
and whether any property which the plaintiff seeks to attach is exempt from
attachment.  The defendant may appear the
hearing.  CCP §484.050(h).  The court generally will evaluate the
attachment application based solely on the pleadings and supporting affidavits
without taking additional evidence.  Bank
of America, supra, 207 Cal.App.3d at 273.  A verified complaint may be used in lieu of
or in addition to an affidavit if it states evidentiary facts.  CCP §482.040. 
The plaintiff has the burden of proof, and the court is not required to
accept as true any affidavit even if it is undisputed.  See Bank of America, supra, at
271, 273.
The court may issue
a right to attach order (Optional Form AT-120) if the plaintiff shows all of
the following: (1) the claim on which the attachment is based is one on which
an attachment may be issued (CCP §484.090(a)(1)); (2) the plaintiff has established
the probable validity of the claim (CCP §484.090(a)(2)); (3) attachment is
sought for no purpose other than the recovery on the subject claim (CCP
§484.090(a)(3); and (4) the amount to be secured by the attachment is greater
than zero (CCP §484.090(a)(4)). 
A claim has
“probable validity” where it is more likely than not that the plaintiff will
recover on that claim.  CCP §481.190.  In determining this issue, the court must
consider the relative merits of the positions of the respective parties.  Kemp Bros. Construction, Inc. v. Titan
Electric Corp., (“Kemp”) (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1474, 1484.  The court does not determine whether the
claim is actually valid; that determination will be made at trial and is not
affected by the decision on the application for the order.  CCP §484.050(b).
Except in unlawful
detainer actions, the amount to be secured by the attachment is the sum of (1)
the amount of the defendant’s indebtedness claimed by the plaintiff, and (2)
any additional amount included by the court for estimate of costs and any allowable
attorneys’ fees under CCP section 482.110. 
CCP §483.015(a); Goldstein v. Barak Construction, (2008) 164
Cal.App.4th 845, 852.  This amount must
be reduced by the sum of (1) the amount of indebtedness that the defendant has
in a money judgment against plaintiff, (2) the amount claimed in a
cross-complaint or affirmative defense and shown would be subject to attachment
against the plaintiff, and (3) the value of any security interest held by the
plaintiff in the defendant’s property, together with the amount by which the
acts of the plaintiff (or a prior holder of the security interest) have
decreased that security interest’s value. 
CCP §483.015(b); see also CCP §483.010(b) (“an attachment may not be
issued on a claim which is secured by any interest in real property arising
from agreement, statute, or other rule of law…However, an attachment may be
issued where the claim was originally so secured but, without any act of the
plaintiff or the person to whom the security was given, the security has become
valueless or has decreased in value to less than the amount then owing on the
claim).  A defendant claiming that the
amount to be secured should be reduced because of a cross-claim or affirmative
defense must make a prima facie showing that the claim would result in an
attachment against the plaintiff.
Before the issuance
of a writ of attachment, the plaintiff is required to file an undertaking to
pay the defendant any amount the defendant may recover for any wrongful
attachment by the plaintiff in the action. 
CCP §489.210.  The undertaking
ordinarily is $10,000. CCP §489.220.  If
the defendant objects, the court may increase the amount of undertaking to the
amount determined as the probable recovery for wrongful attachment.  CCP §489.220. 
The court also has inherent authority to increase the amount of the
undertaking sua sponte.  North
Hollywood Marble Co. v. Superior Court, (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 683, 691.
 
C. Statement of Facts
1. SFI’s Evidence
In March 2019, WT23
approached SFI to arrange transportation of various container loads of
merchandise from Asia to the United States. 
Pian Decl., ¶4.  In connection
with this request, on March 22, 2019, WT23 executed the Agreement wherein WT23
requested a credit limit of $100,000 and credit terms of NET 30 days.  Pian Decl., ¶4, Ex. A.  On April 4, 2019, SFI approved the Agreement
via email subject to a credit limit of $30,000 and credit terms of NET 30
days.  Pian Decl., ¶5, Ex. B.  
Between April 2019 and August 2021, WT23 hired SFI to
arrange transportation for several hundred shipments of merchandise from China
to the United States, which including air and/or ocean transportation, customs
clearance, and other ancillary services at the port of discharge.  Pian Decl., ¶6.  For each of these shipments, SFI’s services
were performed pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement.  Pian Decl., ¶7.  The shipments were delivered to the port of
discharge and tendered to WT23 without incident.  Pian Decl., ¶7.
For each of these shipments, SFI invoiced WT23 for its
services, including all fees invoiced by SFI’s subcontracted transportation
providers, around the time each shipment arrived at the port of discharge in
the United States.  Pian Decl., ¶8.  WT23 at times failed to remit payment within
30 days of the invoice date as required under the Agreement.  Pian Decl., ¶8.  As of August 2, 2021, WT23 owed an
outstanding balance of $204,657.  Pian
Decl., ¶8.
In late August and September 2021, WT23 hired SFI to arrange
transportation for an additional 75 container shipments of merchandise from
China to the United States (“Fall Shipments”). 
Pian Decl., ¶9.  SFI quoted WT23 a
cost for the Fall Shipments of approximately $12,000 per container (approximately
$900,00.00 in total) based on the prevailing freight rates at the time.  Pian Decl., ¶9.
Beginning in November 2021, the Fall Shipments began to
arrive at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, California.  Pian Decl., ¶10.  SFI invoiced WT23 around the time to each
shipment arrived at the marine terminal in the United States.  Pian Decl., ¶10.  WT23 failed to pay SFI for many of the
invoices for the Fall Shipments within 30 days as required by the
Agreement.  Pian Decl., ¶11.
By December 31, 2021, WT23 had a past due balance owed to
SFI exceeding $500,000.  Pian Decl., ¶11.

On January 25, 2022, Serjan Markari (“Markari”) of WT23
contacted SFI’s senior Sales Manager Ya-Wen Pian (“Pian”) via text message to
state that WT23 could not take delivery of some containers from the Fall
Shipments that had been delivered to the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach
and requested SFI arrange for storage of these containers.  Pian Decl., ¶12, Ex. C. 
Throughout January 2022, the last of the Fall Shipments
arrived at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.  Pian Decl., ¶14.  SFI invoiced WT23 for transportation charges
around the time each shipment arrived at a marine terminal.  Pian Decl., ¶14.  By the end of January 2022, WT23 had an
unpaid balance exceeding $600,000.  Pian
Decl., ¶14.  
On January 31, 2024, Pian sent Markari an email that SFI
would release shipments only upon payment of transportation charges pursuant to
the Agreement.  Pian Decl., ¶15, Ex. E.
On February 2, 2022, Markari texted Pian to confirm that
WT23 wanted all container shipments that were bound for general order (i.e.,
those for which WT23 had not paid all transportation fees) to be placed in
warehouse storage.  Pian Decl., ¶13, Ex.
D.  SFI placed 28 of WT23’s containers in
storage over the following weeks at a warehouse in Paramount, California.  Pian Decl., ¶13.
In June 2022, four additional container shipments arrived at
the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. 
Pian Decl., ¶18.  SFI sent WT23
invoices for these shipments and WT23 failed to pay.  Pian Decl., ¶18. Sometime in July 2022, the
marine terminal or possibly the ocean carrier that had transported the
shipments sent the idled shipments to a general order warehouse pending payment
of the outstanding charges.  Pian Decl.,
¶19.  SFI was sent monthly invoices for
storage of the shipments at the general order warehouse and forwarded these
charges to WT23.  Pian Decl., ¶19.
Throughout July and August 2022, SFI repeatedly reminded WT23
of the past due balance for prior shipments that now exceeded $900,000 and that
monthly storage charges were continuing to accrue for the containers stored at
the general order warehouse.  Pian Decl.,
¶20.  SFI requested that WT23 propose a
workable payment schedule to pay down the past due balance but WT23 never
did.  Pian Decl., ¶20.
Since the end of August 2022, WT23 has not paid any portion
of the past due balance, and monthly storage charges have continued to accrue
for 16 container shipments that remain in a SFI-arranged warehouse and three
container shipments that were sent to the general order warehouse.  Pian Decl., ¶21.  SFI sent monthly invoices for these charges,
as well as an accounting statement of the new storage charges and all unpaid
prior charges.  Pian Decl., ¶21. 
As of April 24, 2024, the charges owed by WT23 are
$1,559,863.69, as reflected on the accounting statement.  Pian Decl., ¶22, Ex. F. 
 
2. WT23’s Evidence
WT23 signed the
Agreement understanding that SFI was agreeing to deliver all shipments,
irrespective of whether payment was made, and WT23 would have approximately 30 days to have the goods brought to its
warehouse, packaged and shipped to its customers, and receive payment from customers
for the goods, which WT23 then would use to pay SFI.  Kouyoumjan Decl., ¶6.  WT23 did not have any involvement in drafting
the Agreement; it was presented by SFI on
a take-it-or-leave-it-basis.  Kouyoumjan
Decl., ¶5.  
Between April 2019 and August 2021, SFI coordinated the
importation of WT23’s shipments
from China.  Kouyoumjan Decl., ¶7.  SFI invoiced WT23 at about the time the shipments arrived in the United States,
and SFI delivered those shipments to WT23’s
chosen destination (typically its warehouse) regardless of its credit balance.  During this time, the amount WT23 owed substantially increased from
the original $30,000 credit line. 
Kouyoumjan Decl., ¶7.  By August
2, 2021, WT23’s credit balance was
$204,657.  Kouyoumjan Decl., ¶7.  Nonetheless, SFI continued to deliver
shipments to WT23.  Kouyoumjan Decl., ¶7.  WT23
relied upon the parties’ course of dealing and continued to have SFI provide
freight forwarding services to WT23.  Kouyoumjan Decl., ¶7.  
In or about September 2021, WT23’s Chief Executive Officer, Kevork
Kouyoumjan (“Kouyoumjan”), requested that SFI’s agent in China facilitate
shipment of approximately 75 cargo containers of toys and other goods from
China to fill multiple orders with major retailers for the holiday shopping
season (the Holiday Shipments). 
Kouyoumjan Decl., ¶8.  A dispute
arose regarding the Holiday Shipments because SFI attempted to charge excessive
rates.  Kouyoumjan Decl., ¶9.  WT23
refused to pay the rates demanded but offered to pay prevailing market rates.  Kouyoumjan Decl., ¶9.  SFI refused to reduce its rates for the
Holiday Shipments. SFI delivered all the Holiday Shipments to WT23. 
Kouyoumjan Decl., ¶9.  As a
result, WT23’s purported balance
increased to over $500,000.  Kouyoumjan
Decl., ¶9.   
The request by WT23’s
warehouse manager, Markari, for the temporary storage of two containers was an
isolated incident.  Kouyoumjan
Decl., ¶10.  The reason for this request was that the standard period to remove goods
from the port without charge is two days and WT23’s truck had an accident that
rendered it unavailable for several days. 
Kouyoumjan Decl., ¶10.  The request had nothing to do with WT23’s
ability to store every container that
was imported into the United States.  Kouyoumjan
Decl., ¶10.  Moreover, the parties’ exchange confirms the agreement between the
parties that WT23 could instruct where goods would be delivered prior to any
payment obligation for that shipment and regardless of whether there was any
balance due to SFI.  Kouyoumjan Decl., ¶10.  
On January 31, 2022,
Pian notified Kouyoumjan that SFI
intended to withhold shipments absent payment of its outstanding balance in
direct breach of the Agreement and the parties’ course of dealing.  Kouyoumjan Decl., ¶11.  SFI also
continued to unilaterally impose shipping costs and storage fees for those
shipments well above those charged by other freight forwarders and for which SFI had no legal or contractual basis to charge.  Kouyoumjan Decl., ¶11.  
Kouyoumjan continued
efforts to get SFI to release
its shipments and to stop SFI
from continuing to add additional shipping fees and storage charges and offered
to have SFI deliver the
containers to WT23’s warehouse in order to avoid any storage or demurrage fees.  Kouyoumjan Decl., ¶12.  Pian
refused these offers.  Kouyoumjan
Decl., ¶12.  
In March 2022, Kouyoumjan
expressly directed Pian in writing to stop importing any more containers.  Kouyoumjan Decl., ¶13, Ex. B. 
Despite these express instructions, SFI continued to pick up containers in China with Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant
WT23 goods, incurring the cost of import, and then refusing to deliver the
containers to WT23 when they arrived in the United States causing WT23 to incur
additional fees and charges for the shipping and storage of those containers.  Kouyoumjan Decl., ¶13.
In or about May
2022, Pian advised Kouyoumjan that it would allow the release of individual
containers if WT23 agreed to pay shipping charges for the containers being
released as well as a per-container premium that would go to paying down the
outstanding balance SFI contended
that Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant WT23 owed. 
Kouyoumjan Decl., ¶14.  Faced with the need to fill orders from its
clients, Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant WT23 paid the shipping charges and the
per-container premium for 15 of the containers. 
Kouyoumjan Decl., ¶14.  After payment, SFI released the containers to
WT23.  Kouyoumjan Decl., ¶14.  
On June 29, 2022, Kouyoumjan
sent a demand letter to SFI
advising that WT23 would be willing to pay the shipping charges for all of the
containers being held if SFI
released all the containers immediately, and also would discuss a payment plan
for previous debt.  Kouyoumjan
Decl., ¶15, Ex. C.  SFI once again refused insisted that containers would only be released upon
the payment of shipping charges and a per-container premium until the outstanding
balance was paid.  Kouyoumjan
Decl., ¶15.  
On July 7, 2022,
Pian reiterated SFI’s refusal to release any of the containers it was
withholding unless WT23 paid all outstanding balances owed and advised that it
would no longer pay the fees and storage costs of WT23’s containers and the
storage facility would auction off the contents of those containers.  Kouyoumjan Decl., ¶16, Ex. D.  Pian
further advised Kouyoumjan that SFI had unilaterally and without prior notice transferred some of WT23’s
containers to the Port of Long Beach and the Federal Maritime Commission
(“FMC”) for storage resulting in demurrage and detention charges (“D&D
Charges”) of several thousands of dollars per container per month.  Kouyoumjan Decl., ¶17.  
In total, SFI withheld a total of 32 containers that WT23 needed
