The defendant, LAPD, has redacted complaints and withheld certain records, citing exemptions under Penal Code section 832.7. The court has endeavored to cite the correct statutes and has denied Garcia's requests for judicial notice of certain documents. The court has also noted that LAPD's redactions include names, addresses, and phone numbers of victims, as well as information subject to the personal privacy exemption. The court has rejected Garcia's requests for autopsy photographs, citing exemptions under Code of Civil Procedure Code section 129 and Penal Code section 832.7(b)(6)(C) and (b)(7).
