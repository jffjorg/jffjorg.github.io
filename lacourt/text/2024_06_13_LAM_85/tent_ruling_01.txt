  Case Number:  23STCP02244    Hearing Date:   June 13, 2024    Dept:  85 
Garcia v. City of Los Angeles, et
al., 
23STCP02244

Tentative decision on petition for traditional
writ of mandate:  mostly denied




 



 
Petitioner Sergio Garcia (“Garcia”) seeks a traditional writ
of mandate commanding Respondents City of Los Angeles (“City”) and Los Angeles
Police Department (“LAPD”) to comply with the California Public Records Act
(“CPRA”).  
The court has read and considered the moving papers,
opposition, and reply,[1]
and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
A. Statement of
the Case
1. Petition
Petitioner Garcia filed the Petition on June 27, 2023
against Respondents City and LAPD, alleging causes of action for violation of (1)
the CPRA (Government[2]
Code § 6259, et seq.) and (2) the California Constitution, art. 1,
section 3(b).  The Petition alleges in
pertinent part as follows.
On January 13, 2019, Garcia submitted two requests to LAPD’s
Risk Management and Legal Affairs Division (“RMLAD”) for records pertaining to 13
former LAPD officers for dishonesty, officer-involved shootings (“OIS”) or
serious use-of-force (“UOF”) resulting in serious injury or death, or for committing
sexual acts against a member of the public. 
Pet., ¶¶ 24, 52; Exs. A, X.  All
the records requested fall within the definition of public records set forth in
the CPRA.  Pet., ¶¶25, 52.
On January 16 and 17, 2019, LAPD requested a 14-day
extension of time to respond to Garcia’s records request and opened a portal
for public visibility: NextRequest #19-233 and NR#19-234.  Pet., ¶¶26, 54.  LAPD has not timely or adequately produced
responsive records.  
Garcia seeks mandamus compelling the City to perform a
prompt and diligent search and provide him with the requested records or, in
the alternative, show cause why the records should not be ordered
disclosed.  Prayer at a.  Garcia also seeks a declaration that the City
has violated the CPRA and California constitution by refusing to produce
records and failing to properly assist Garcia with his requests.  Prayer at c. 
Garcia further seeks an award of costs.  Prayer at d.
 
2. Course of Proceedings 
On July 24, 2023, Respondent City filed an Answer.
 
B. Standard of Review
A party may seek to set
aside an agency decision by petitioning for either a writ of administrative
mandamus (CCP §1094.5) or of traditional mandamus.  CCP §1085.  A
petition for traditional mandamus is appropriate in all actions “to compel the
performance of an act which the law specially enjoins as a duty resulting from
an office, trust, or station....”  CCP §1085.   
            A
traditional writ of mandate under CCP section 1085 is the method of compelling
the performance of a legal, ministerial duty.  Pomona Police Officers’
Assn. v. City of Pomona, (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 578, 583-84. 
Generally, mandamus will lie when (1) there is no plain, speedy, and adequate
alternative remedy, (2) the respondent has a duty to perform, and (3) the
petitioner has a clear and beneficial right to performance.  Id. at
584 (internal citations omitted).  Whether a statute imposes a ministerial
duty for which mandamus is available, or a mere obligation to perform a
discretionary function, is a question of statutory interpretation.  AIDS
Healthcare Foundation v. Los Angeles County Dept. of Public Health, (2011)
197 Cal.App.4th 693, 701. 
            Where
a duty is not ministerial and the agency has discretion, mandamus relief is
unavailable unless the petitioner can demonstrate an abuse of that
discretion.  Mandamus will not lie to compel the exercise of a public
agency’s discretion in a particular manner.  American Federation of
State, County and Municipal Employees v. Metropolitan Water District of
Southern California, (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 247, 261.  It is available
to compel an agency to exercise discretion where it has not done so (Los
Angeles County Employees Assn. v. County of Los Angeles, (1973) 33
Cal.App.3d 1, 8), and to correct an abuse of discretion actually exercised. 
Manjares v. Newton, (1966) 64 Cal.2d 365, 370-71.  In making this
determination, the court may not substitute its judgment for that of the
agency, whose decision must be upheld if reasonable minds may disagree as to
its wisdom.  Id. at 371.  An agency decision is an abuse of
discretion only if it is “arbitrary, capricious, entirely lacking in
evidentiary support, unlawful, or procedurally unfair.”  Kahn v. Los
Angeles City Employees’ Retirement System, (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 98,
106.  A writ will lie where the agency’s discretion can be exercised only
in one way.  Hurtado v. Superior Court, (1974) 11 Cal.3d 574, 579. 
            No
administrative record is required for traditional mandamus to compel
performance of a ministerial duty or as an abuse of discretion.  
 
C. Governing Law
1. The
California Constitution
            The people have the
constitutional right of access to information concerning the conduct of the
people's business, and, therefore, the meetings of public bodies and the
writings of public officials and agencies shall be open to public scrutiny.  Cal. Const., art. 1, §3(b)(1).  A statute, court rule, or other authority shall
be broadly construed if it furthers the people's right of access, and narrowly
construed if it limits the right of access. 
Cal. Const., art. 1, §3(b)(2).  If
a statute, court rule, or other authority adopted after the effective date of
this subdivision of the constitution limits the right of access, it shall be
adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation
and the need for protecting that interest. 
Cal. Const., art. 1, §3(b)(2).  
 
            2. The CPRA 
The CPRA,
located at section 7920 et
seq. (formerly 6250 et seq.)[3] was enacted in 1968 to
safeguard the accountability of government to the public.  San Gabriel Tribune v. Superior Court,
(1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 762, 771-72.  The
CPRA’s purpose is to increase freedom of information by giving the public
access to information in the possession of public agencies.  CBS. Inc. v. Block, (1986) 42 Cal.3d
646, 651. The CPRA was intended to safeguard the accountability of government
to the public, and it makes public access to governmental records a fundamental
right of citizenship. Wilson v. Superior Court, (1996) 51 Cal.App.4th
1136, 1141. This requires maximum disclosure of the conduct of government
operations.  California State
University Fresno Assn., Inc. v. Superior Court, (“California State
University”) (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 810, 823. 
The CPRA makes clear that “every person” has a right to
inspect any public record. §7922.525(a) (former §6253(a)). The term “public
record” is broadly defined to include “any writing containing information
relating to the conduct of the people’s business prepared, owned, used or
retained by any state or local agency regardless of physical form or
characteristics. §7920.530 (former §6252(e)). 
Upon receiving a request for a copy of public records, the agency
shall determine within ten days whether the request seeks public records in the
possession of the agency that are subject to disclosure, though that deadline
may be extended up to 14 days for “unusual circumstances.” (§7922.535(a), (b))
(former §6253(c)).  If the agency
determines that the request seeks disclosable public records, the agency shall
also state the estimated date and time when the records will be made
available.   §7922.535(a).  If the agency determines that the request for records
is denied in whole or in part, the agency must respond in writing and justify
withholding any record by demonstrating that the record is exempt or that the
facts of the case the public interest served by not disclosing clearly
outweighs the public interest in disclosure. 
§§ 7922.540, 7922.000 (former §6255(a)).
If the agency determines that the requested records are
subject to disclosure, it shall make the records promptly available upon
payment of fees for direct costs of duplication or a statutory fee, if
applicable.  §7922.530(a).  There is no deadline expressed in a number of
days for producing the records.  Rather, section
7922.530 says the agency “shall make the records promptly available.” Section
7922.500 (former §6253(d)) provides that nothing in the CPRA “shall be
construed to permit an agency to delay or obstruct the inspection or copying of
public records.”.
“Records requests . . . inevitably impose some burden on
government agencies.  An agency is
obliged to comply so long as the record can be located with reasonable effort.”
California First Amendment Coalition v. Superior Court, (1998) 67
Cal.App.4th 159, 165-66.  “Reasonable
efforts do not require that agencies undertake extraordinarily extensive or
intrusive searches, however. [Citation.] In general, the scope of an agency’s
search for public records ‘need only be reasonably calculated to locate
responsive documents.’” City of San Jose v. Superior Court, (“City of
San Jose”) (2017) 2 Cal.5th 608, 627. The “CPRA does not prescribe specific
methods of searching for those documents.  Agencies may develop their own internal
policies for conducting searches.  Some
general principles have emerged, however.  Once an agency receives a CPRA request, it
must ‘communicate the scope of the information requested to the custodians of
its records,’ although it need not use the precise language of the request.
[Citation.].” Ibid.
 
3. Exemptions
            The
right to inspect is subject to certain exemptions, which are narrowly
construed.  California State
University, supra, 90 Cal.App.4th at 831.  The burden of demonstrating that exemptions
apply lies with the governmental entity. 
§7922.000.  Aside from a defined
exemption, the entity can demonstrate that on the facts of the particular case
the public interest served by not disclosing the record clearly outweighs the
public interest served by disclosure of the record.  Id.
 
a. Penal Code
Section 832.7
Notwithstanding
section 7923.600 or any other law, a record relating to the report,
investigation, or findings of (i) an incident involving the discharge of  a firearm at a person by a peace officer,
(ii) an incident involving the use of force against a person by a peace officer
that resulted in death or great bodily injury, (iii) a sustained finding of
unreasonable or excessive force, or (iv) a sustained finding that an officer
failed to intervene shall be disclosed under the CPRA.   Penal Code §832.7(b)(1)(A).
 “An agency shall redact a record disclosed
pursuant to this section only
for any of the following purposes: (A) [t]o remove personal data or
information, such as a home address, telephone number, or identities of family
members, other than the names and work-related information of peace and
custodial officers…(B) [t]o preserve the anonymity of whistleblowers,
complainants, victims, and witnesses…(C) [t]o protect confidential medical,
financial, or other information of which disclosure is specifically prohibited
by federal law or would cause an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy that
clearly outweighs the strong public interest in records about possible
misconduct and use of force by peace officers and custodial officers…(D) [w]here
there is a specific, articulable, and particularized reason to believe that
disclosure of the record would pose a significant danger to the physical safety
of the peace officer, custodial officer, or another person.”  Penal Code §832.7(b)(6).
“Notwithstanding
paragraph (6), an agency may redact a record disclosed pursuant to this section, including personal identifying information,
where, on the facts of the particular case, the public interest served by not
disclosing the information clearly outweighs the public interest served by
disclosure of the information.”  Penal
Code §832.7(b)(7).
An agency may
withhold a record of an incident that is the subject of an active criminal or
administrative investigation as follows: During an active investigation,
disclosure may be delayed for 60 days from the date of misconduct or use of
force or until the district attorney determines whether to file criminal
charges, whichever occurs sooner.  The
agency shall provide the specific basis in writing for its determination that a
delay in disclosure outweighs the public interest in disclosure.  Penal Code §832.7(b)(8)(A)(i).  After 60 days from the misconduct or use of
force, the agency may continue to delay disclosure if it could reasonably be
expected to interfere with a criminal enforcement proceeding against the officer.  The agency shall, at 180-day intervals,
provide in writing the specific basis for its determination that disclosure
could reasonably be expected to interfere with a criminal enforcement
proceeding.  The writing shall include
the estimated date of disclosure.  The
information shall be disclosed when the specific basis for withholding is
resolved, when the investigation or proceeding is no longer active, or by no
later than 18 months after the incident, whichever occurs first.  Penal Code §832.7(b)(8)(A)(ii).  
 
b. Section 7927.700 (Employee Confidential
Information)
Personnel, medical, or similar files are exempt when their
disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  §7927.700. 
The home addresses, home telephone numbers, personal cellular telephone numbers,
and birthdates of all employees of a public agency shall not be deemed to be
public records or open to public inspection except in particular
circumstances.  §7928.300(a).
In City of
San Jose, supra, 2 Cal.5th at 608, the California Supreme
Court held that while city employees’ private voicemails, e-mails, and text
messages relating to city business may be subject to disclosure under the CPRA,
“[a]ny personal information not related to the conduct of public business, or
material falling under a statutory exemption, can be redacted from public
records that are produced or presented for review.”  Id. at 625-26.  See also Labor & Workforce
Development Agency v. Superior Court, (2018) 19 Cal. App. 5th 12, 31 (describing
City of San Jose as not wanting to “allow evasion of [the CPRA] simply
by the use of a personal account”).  
 
4. Enforcement
A CPRA claim to compel compliance with a public records
request may proceed through either mandamus or declaratory relief.  §7923.000. Because the petitioner may proceed
through either mandamus or declaratory relief, the trial court independently
decides whether disclosure is required.  See City of San Jose v. Superior
Court, (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 1008, 1018 (appellate court independently
reviews trial court CPRA decision).  No
administrative record is required, and the parties must submit admissible
evidence.
            Section 7923.000
authorizes a mandamus writ only when “public records are being improperly
withheld from a member of the public”. 
The CPRA remedy is available only to a person who is seeking
disclosure of public records and only where the public entity is
allegedly improperly withholding those records. 
County of Santa Clara v. Superior Court, (“County of Santa
Clara”) (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 119, 126. 
If the court finds that the public official’s decision to refuse
disclosure is not justified, the court shall order the public official to make
the record public.  §7923.110(a).  The CPRA provides no judicial remedy
for any other purpose or entity or a remedy that may be utilized for any
purpose other than to determine whether a particular record or class of records
must be disclosed.”  Id. at 127
(emphasis in original).
If the requestor prevails in such litigation, the court
shall award court costs and reasonable attorney’s fees, to be paid by the
public agency at issue. 
§7923.115(a).  If the case was
clearly frivolous, the court shall award court costs and reasonable attorney’s
fees to the public agency.  §7923.115(b).
 
D. Statement of Facts[4]
1. Petitioner’s
Evidence
Garcia submitted
CPRA requests to the City and LAPD for records related to police misconduct and
uses of force disclosable by SB 1421. 
Garcia Decl., ¶¶2-3.  Garcia filed
the instant lawsuit four years and six months later.  Garcia Decl., ¶3.
Garcia submitted
numerous external messages through NextRequest (“NR”) in an attempt to resolve
or narrow the scope LAPD’s search for SB 1421 records.  He expressed concern about  timing and asked LAPD to provide an estimate
for completion of production of SB 1421 records.  Garcia Decl., ¶5.  
 
Communications
With Escalante and Garcia’s Complaints
Garcia initiated
communication by telephone on June 18, 2019 and spoke with Detective III Diane
Escalante (“Escalante”) to determine the reason why LAPD was not complying with
his records request.  Garcia Decl., ¶6.  He asserted that LAPD possessed the 15 police
officers’ personnel files containing OIS, Internal Affairs Division (“IAD”) case
files involving sustained complaints of dishonesty, use of force (“UOF”), and
sexual acts.  Garcia Decl., ¶6.  Garcia provided Escalante with the OIS
case file numbers and IAD case numbers and names and serial numbers of the 15
officers.   Garcia Decl., ¶6.  He asserted that LAPD was making false
contentions that the case files had not been located for four of the officers.  Garcia Decl., ¶6.  Escalante informed Garcia that in two to
three months he would be receiving the SB 1421 records for the officers, including
but not limited to: photographs of the crime scenes, mug shots, search
warrants, depositions, witness statements, felony complaint and arrest
reports.  Garcia Decl., ¶6, Ex. E
(providing case file numbers and stating that she was unable to provide
production date for sustained dishonesty records).
On October 4, 2019, Garcia submitted an External Message in
portal NR #19-5731 to then Lieutenant II Brian O’Conner (“O’Conner”), asserting
that Escalante had been dishonest, he was being denied disclosable records, and
he was being racially discriminated against. 
Garcia Decl., ¶7, Ex. I.  O’Conner
refused to respond.  Garcia Decl., ¶7.
On March 6, 2020, Garcia submitted an email to then Captain
III Bryan D. Lium (“Lium”), asserting that he had made repeated CPRA records
requests and asking where his records were. 
Garcia Decl., ¶8, Ex. J.
On March 7, 2020, Garcia was informed by neighbors that an
“army of LAPD thugs” attempted to break into his condominium building and
threatened neighbors to open the door. 
Garcia Decl., ¶9.  Garcia’s former
neighbor, Leo, who later suffered a heart attack and died, told Garcia he was
threatened by Robbery-Homicide Division (“RHD”) Detective Martin Mojarro
(“Mojarro”).  Garcia Decl., ¶9.  Another neighbor witnessed Mojarro attempting
to make forcible entry into Garcia’s condominium unit, causing damage to the
door frame.  Garcia Decl., ¶9, Ex.
K.  On the same day, Garcia filed a
personnel complaint against Lium, Mojarro, and Escalante.  Garcia Decl., ¶10, Ex. L.  
On March 9, 2020, Garcia sent correspondence to LAPD Chief
Michael Moore (“Moore”) detailing the failure to comply with his record
request, expressing concern about the timing of production, and asking for LAPD
to provide an estimated date for completion of the production of the records.  Garcia Decl., ¶11, Ex. M.  On June 10, 2020, Garcia sent additional correspondence
to Chief Moore raising the same concerns. 
Garcia Decl., ¶12, Ex. N.
On July 21, 2020, Garcia filed a personnel complaint against
Chief Moore but was never contacted nor did IAD investigate the complaint.  Garcia Decl., ¶13, Ex. O.
 
The Initial Production
Following these external messages and emails, LAPD produced
some records for the requests.  Garcia
Decl., ¶14.  LAPD shortly thereafter began
to deny production of records containing sustained complaints of dishonesty,
sexual acts, and any OIS for the 15 officers. 
Garcia Decl., ¶14.
On March 23, 2023, Garcia sent correspondence to RMLAD
Captain II Yasir Gillani (“Gillani”) detailing the failure to comply with his
CPRA requests, expressing concerns about the timing of production, and asking
LAPD to provide an estimated date for completion of the production of
records.  Garcia Decl., ¶15, Ex. P.  Gillani refused to respond.  Garcia Decl., ¶15, Ex. P.  
The following day, March 24, 2023, Garcia made a CPRA
request to Inspector General Mark P. Smith (“OIG”) for records including any
and all electronic messages, or emails, of all LAPD OIG and the Board of Police
Commissioners regarding NR 19-233 and 19-234 from January 13, 2019 to the
present.  Garcia Decl., ¶16.
 
Post-Lawsuit Communications
On May 6, 2023, Garcia sent Chief Moore correspondence
detailing the failure to comply with his CPRA records request and a notice that
he had filed a verified Petition for Writ of Mandate.  Garcia Decl., ¶17, Ex. Q. 
On May 18, 2023, the OIG sent some records in response to
Garcia’s request.  Garcia Decl.,
¶18.  In an email exchange dated January
17, 2023, Inspector General Smith informed his Aide, Sergeant II Joseph G.
Fransen (“Fransen”), that the Threat Management Unit (“TMU”) was notified to
spy, surveil, and monitor Garcia.  Garcia
Decl., ¶18, Ex. FF.  The following day,
Garcia filed a personnel complaint against Fransen, detailing that Fransen
stated to Garcia: “Okay, I am going to discontinue this call and I am going to
contact the threat management unit and have you killed.”  Garcia Decl., ¶19, Ex. R.  Garcia was never contacted nor did IAD
investigate this complaint.  Garcia
Decl., ¶19.
On May 20, 2023,
Garcia made a fifth SB 1421 CPRA request, RN 23-5251, to the TMU seeking
records of spying, conducting surveillance, and a background check on
Garcia.  Garcia Decl., ¶20, Ex.
EE.  The TMU refused to comply with this
request.  Garcia Decl., ¶20.
On June 13, 2023,
RMLAD Officer-in-Charge Lieutenant Eric R. Quan (“Quan”) sent Garcia correspondence
that it was unable to locate responsive disclosable records for 11 of the 15
former LAPD officers.  Garcia
Decl., ¶21, Ex. D.  Lt. Quan stated that
LAPD would conduct another search to locate responsive records and search would
not be complete until on or about September 7, 2023.  Garcia Decl., ¶21. Ex. D.
On the same day, Garcia sent correspondence to Lt. Quan
asserting that records for all 15 former officers exist and are in the
possession of LAPD.  Garcia Decl., ¶22,
Ex. S.  The following day, Lt. Quan consented to a taped-recorded conference
wherein Garcia asserted that he was in possession of some of IAD’s criminal
investigation of the LAPD 1980 Hollywood burglary scandal containing more than
3500 records of the 13 officers in request RN 19-233.  Garcia Decl., ¶23.  LAPD had these records but was refusing to
comply.  Garcia Decl., ¶23.  This recorded call was memorialized in an
email correspondence with Lt. Quan wherein Garcia attached exhibits of
unredacted IAD records to prove they exist and are in the LAPD’s possession.  Garcia Decl., ¶23.  Garcia also asserted the LAPD was in
possession of IAD criminal investigation records for Richard Herman Ford and
Robert Anthony Von Villas which contained records of dishonesty and OIS records
for request RN 19-234.  Garcia Decl.,
¶¶23-24, Exs. B-C, T.  
On June 15, 2023, Garcia
sent an email correspondence to Captain Gillani attaching the same exhibits as
well as the June 14, 2023 email correspondence with Lt. Quan.  Garcia Decl., ¶25, Ex. U.
On October 5, 2023,
the parties appeared at a Trial Setting Conference wherein Park argued that
LAPD needed six more months to comply.  Garcia
Decl., ¶29.  The court ruled that the
City and LAPD had four months to comply, on or before February 1, 2024.  Garcia Decl., ¶29.
On October 17, 2023, Garcia emailed Deputy City Attorney
Howard Park (“Park”) to meet and confer on the issues raised in the Petition.  Garcia Decl., ¶26.  The next day Park responded that “we would
not be able to meet until mid-November due LAPD scheduling conflict.”  Garcia Decl., ¶26, Ex. V.  
On December 14, 2023, Garcia met and conferred with Park in
an attempt to resolve and narrow the scope of the search.  Garcia Decl., ¶27.  He was made aware by Park that RMLAD Det. III
Sheryl Rush (“Rush”), assigned to releasing of SB 1421 records, refused to meet
and confer with Garcia.  Garcia Decl.,
¶27.  In the meet and confer, Garcia allowed
Park access to review the 3500 pages of IAD records confirming that LAPD is in
possession of the SB 1421 records and not complying.  Garcia Decl., ¶27.   Park reviewed the IAD records and at one
point was shocked and stated: “Why did they redact the DR No.?”  Garcia Decl., ¶27.  Garcia expressed his concern about the timing
of production and asked for an estimated date for completion of the production
of SB 1421 records.  Garcia Decl., ¶27.
On December 18, 2023, Garcia submitted an email to Park
memorializing his concerns: (1) LAPD was “intentionally and willfully” refusing
to comply with his SB 1421 requests; (2) LAPD had gone to great lengths to
retaliate and racially discriminate against him; and (3) Detective Rush
retaliated by refusing to meet and confer with him. Garcia Decl., ¶28.  Park emailed the same day and indicated: “I
plan to meet with LAPD again soon and redouble our efforts to make sure we are
doing the best we can to comply with CPRA.” 
Garcia Decl., ¶28, Ex. W. 
On February 1, 2024,
the parties appeared before Judge Mitch Beckloff at a Trial Setting
Conference.  Garcia Decl.,
¶30.  LAPD had not produced any SB 1421
records and informed the court it needed two more months to comply.  Garcia Decl., ¶30.  Garcia objected, citing a history in which LAPD
intentionally failed to complete and obstructed production of the requested
records.  Garcia Decl., ¶30.  Judge Beckloff set a trial date and briefing schedule.  Garcia Decl., ¶30.  
To date, the requested records have not been produced on a
rollout basis and LAPD denies the records exist.  Garcia Decl., ¶31.  LAPD has not searched or produced any of the
responsive records since the lawsuit was filed. 
Garcia Decl., ¶31.  LAPD is
retaliating and racially discriminating against Garcia because he filed personnel
complaints for refusing to comply with his CPRA requests.  Garcia Decl., ¶31.
 
2. City’s Evidence

SB 1421 and SB 16
In 2019, SB 1421 amended Penal Code section832.7 to make the
following four categories of records disclosable in response to a CPRA request:
those relating to an OIS, a UOF resulting in death or great bodily injury, a
sustained incident of dishonesty, and a sustained incident of sexual assault.  Rush Decl., ¶2.  
In 2022, Penal Code section 832.7 was amended again by SB
16, which made four more categories of records disclosable: sustained findings
of unreasonable or excessive force, sustained findings of failure to intervene,
sustained findings of prejudice or discrimination, and sustained findings that
an officer made an unlawful arrest or conducted an unlawful search.  Rush Decl., ¶2.
 
The SB 1421 Unit
In 2019, to respond to a flurry of CPRA requests for records
disclosable pursuant to SB 1421, LAPD created the SB 1421 Unit (sometimes
“Unit”) within RMLAD to process those requests. Rush Decl., ¶3.  The SB 1421 Unit's role is to identify,
collect, and produce records that are subject to disclosure under Penal Code section
832.7(b)(l)(A)-(E).  The SB 1421 Unit
works with the custodians of the records of the Force Investigation Division (“FID”),
Critical Incident Review Division (“CIRD”), and Internal Affairs Group (“IAG”)
to determine as an initial matter if a record qualifies for disclosure based on
the statutory definitions in Penal Code section 832.7(b)(l)(A)-(E).  Rush Decl., ¶3.  The report packages that LAPD discloses
pursuant to Penal Code section 832.7(b)(l) range between 30 pages to over 100
pages.  The disclosed reports contain
various redactions that are required and/or authorized under Penal Code section
832.7(b)(6) and (7), including to maintain the anonymity of witnesses and
complainants and to protect medical information.  Rush Decl., ¶3.
On December 31,
2018, LAPD received a temporary restraining order in Los Angeles Police
Protective League v. City of Los Angeles, Case No. 18STCP03495, directing it
refrain from enforcing or applying the SB 1421 amendments to Penal Code section
832.7 in any manner which would result in the disclosure of records regarding
incidents or conduct prior to January 1, 2019. 
Rush Decl., ¶4.  Until the stay
was lifted on or around March 1, 2019, LAPD did not produce any such records.  Rush Decl., ¶4.
 
Garcia’s Requests
and the Initial Search
On January 13, 2019,
Garcia made two requests for personnel records and 18 complaints, including
misconduct and UOF incidents, for 15 former LAPD officers.  Rush Decl., ¶5.  Specifically, NR #19-233 requested SB 1421
records for 13 former LAPD officers and NR #19-234 requested SB 1421 records
for two additional officers, all of whom appeared to have separated from the
LAPD long ago.  Rush Decl., ¶5.  The records requested by Garcia were very
old, spanning from the l960s through the 1980s. 
Rush Decl., ¶5.
The requests were
initially handled by the SB 1421 Unit, which searched for, located, and
provided a number of records to Garcia. 
Rush Decl., ¶6.  The SB 1421 Unit
tasked IAG, FID, and CIRD with conducting the searches for responsive records
including complaints, OIS records, and UOF records.  Rush Decl., ¶6.  Once these documents were identified, they
were to be scanned if responsive to the records request and Gracia was notified.  Rush Decl., ¶6.  The Unit was able to identify some complaint
numbers, but they could not locate many documents due to their age.  Rush Decl., ¶6.
The SB 1421 Unit
released records to Garcia on March 26, May 22, July 16, July 23, July 27, and August
13, 2020, on January 7, May 6, September 2, and November 10, 2021 on March 3,
2022, and on January 26 and April 17, 2023. 
Rush Decl., ¶7.  The records
included OIS log sheets, OIS executive summaries, and copies of 11 personnel
complaints related to dishonesty.  Rush
Decl., ¶7.
 
Rush’s Additional Search
The SB 1421 Unit
conducted another search for responsive records related to the requests in May
2023.  Rush Decl., ¶¶8, 39.  Rush’s team attempted to identify OIS records
based on records retention lists that have limited information about what is in
the record boxes.  Rush Decl., ¶8.  Rush’s team coordinated with the Records and
Identification Division (“R&I”) and the City Clerk’s Office to determine
what additional record boxes might contain missing OIS records.   Rush Decl., ¶8.  The Unit requested multiple boxes with titles
that appeared to be related to OIS, sometimes locating a few records
potentially relevant to Garcia's request, but more often not locating any
responsive records, or only locating a copy of the shooting investigation and
the shooting review board determination. 
Rush Decl., ¶8. 
To locate additional
records, the SB 1421 Unit found the names of partners of the requested officers
and looked through their files to determine whether there were additional
complaint numbers or reports that might be related or responsive.  Rush Decl., ¶9.  Garcia also provided some names to Rush’s
team, and they searched for those names as well as their partners.  Rush Decl., ¶9.  Rush’s team was able to find reports or
shooting logs for each OIS identified as subject to disclosure involving the
officers Garcia requested.  Rush Decl.,
¶9.  The recordkeeping for records of
this age, from the 1960s through the 1980s, was somewhat disorganized and not
standardized by division, making the search more difficult.  Rush Decl., ¶9.  
Multiple members of
Rush’s team went to the City Clerk's Office on multiple dates to search through
numerous boxes to locate the requested records, or to  identify some of the incidents for which Garcia
provided little information.  Rush Decl.,
¶10.  Any records identified generally
had to be scanned one page at a time due to their age.  Rush Decl., ¶10.
Rush’s team further
searched databases to attempt to identify and locate arrest information for
suspects involved in the OIS and requested R&I to assist in searching for
available microfilmed records.  Rush
Decl., ¶11.  Rush’s team searched for
personnel complaints and their associated addenda, which required obtaining the
personnel packages from the Personnel Division (“PD”), which would request the personnel
packages from an off-site record storage facility.  Rush Decl., ¶11.  Many personnel packages could not be located.  Rush Decl., ¶11.  Searches also were conducted for the
personnel packages of the partners of accused officers to attempt to locate the
personnel complaint and/or addenda that was missing.  Rush Decl., ¶11.  The searches included requesting boxes
archived by IAG to attempt to locate copies of personnel complaints or addenda
that were missing, which was unsuccessful. 
Rush Decl., ¶11.  Additionally,
Rush’s team requested searches by the Technical Investigation Division (“TID”),
Photography Unit, to pull archived boxes with photograph negatives related to
the requested incidents.  Rush Decl.,
¶11.  Once any negatives were located,
they had to be scanned and digitized. 
Rush Decl., ¶11.
On May 16, 2023, Rush
contacted CIRD to conduct additional searches to determine any OIS DR numbers
related to Jack Myers or any other previously identified OIS files.  Rush Decl., ¶12.  CIRD did not have additional information but
noted that one of the DR numbers had two different dates of the incident. With the additional
date, Rush was able to locate additional information that potentially related
to the requested OIS records.  Rush
Decl., ¶12.
On May 17, 2023, Rush
reviewed LAPD's records retention lists and identified five archived boxes of OIS
that included the time periods for the OIS files requested by Garcia.  She received several boxes on May 18, 2023.  Rush Decl., ¶13.
On May 19, 2023, Rush
contacted R&I and requested that they search for OIS files and documents,
including the two alleged OIS incidents involving Jack Myers.  Rush Decl., ¶14.  R&I had files from the 1970s on microfilm
but did not have records extending back to the 1960s.  Rush Decl., ¶14.
On May 25, 2023, Rush
contacted FID to check for scans of documents and contacted CIRD to request
searches for two former officers whose names and serial numbers she identified.  Rush Decl., ¶15.  CIRD responded that there were no responsive
records for either officer, so Rush continued to review records to determine if
they qualified for disclosure under any of the categories specified in Penal
Code section 832.7(b)(l).  Rush Decl.,
¶15.  Rush also continued to review
records retention lists and search archived boxes to determine if there were
additional responsive records.  Rush
Decl., ¶15.
            On June 13, 2023, Rush
searched the FID repository of scanned OIS records and located some additional
documents pertaining to the requested records, which FID reviewed to determine
if they qualified for disclosure under Penal Code section 832.7(b)(l).  Rush Decl., ¶16.
            On June 14, 2023,
Rush went to the City Clerk’s office and searched through four additional boxes
containing OIS records for the years of 1968, 1974, and 1977.  She located several documents potentially
responsive to Garcia’s request, including several Shooting Review Board
documents and reports.  Rush Decl., ¶17.
            On
August 11, 2023, Rush went to the City Clerk’s Office and searched through six
additional boxes of OIS records, finding a few records that were potentially
responsive to Garcia’s request.  Rush
Decl., ¶18.  On August 18, 2023, Rush inquired of RHD and was later informed that RHD does
not have records related to the OIS incidents she requested.  Rush Decl., ¶19.  
Based on complaint
numbers discovered during previous searches, on September 6, 2023, Rush’s team
conducted additional searches for two complaint numbers but was unable to
locate them.  Rush Decl., ¶20.  Rush’s team released records for one of the
OIS incidents they did find (68-493169) on September 14, 2023.  Rush Decl., ¶20.  
On September 20,
2023, Rush requested personnel packages for seven former officers.  Rush Decl., ¶21.  PD informed Rush on September 25, 2023 that
two of the packages had been located, and four more were located on September
29, 2023.  Rush Decl., ¶21.
On October 12, 2023,
Rush requested from the City Clerk’s office two boxes to attempt to locate
additional OIS records.  Rush Decl.,
¶22.  Rush reviewed additional retention
lists for the dates and information from the identified OIS numbers, and any
IAG box that might be related to the complaints that they were unable to locate
from personnel packages.  Rush Decl.,
¶22.
            On November 22, 2023, Rush
contacted FID to attempt to locate any additional documents based on additional
information her team uncovered during their research.  Rush Decl., ¶23.  FID discovered one record, which Rush already
had.  Rush Decl., ¶23.  No new records were located.  Rush Decl., ¶23.
            On December 8, 2023, Rush
contacted IAG to see if it had copies of the 12 missing complaints or
complaints with missing information. 
Rush Decl., ¶24.
            On December 13, 2023, Rush
went with another member of the SB 1421 team to the City Clerk’s office to
review the IAG files relating to 12 of the complaints and attempted to locate
additional information regarding the complaints, investigations, or related
documents.  Rush Decl., ¶25.  They were unable to locate complaints or
related documents.  Rush Decl., ¶25.  The City Clerk’s office assisted them in
pulling additional IAG boxes for the years that may have had complaints, and they
searched those entire boxes as well. 
Rush Decl., ¶25.  
For nearly all the
complaints, the boxes had been signed out by PD, so Rush’s team were unable to
locate the files in those boxes.  Rush
Decl., ¶25.  Rush requested the personnel packages from PD, which stored the
records in three different off-site locations and was only able to locate eight
of the 15 personnel packages for the officers requested by Garcia.  Rush Decl., ¶25.  Rush also searched nine other officers’
personnel packages who were not named by Garcia, but whose names were found in
the other officers’ complaints.  Rush
Decl., ¶25.
            Rush’s team was unable
to locate the personnel package for Joseph Balleweg.  Rush Decl., ¶26.  Many of the personnel packages refer to
Balleweg’s personnel package and notes in several officers’ personnel packages stated:
“[F]ull complaint in Balleweg's package.” 
Rush Decl., ¶26.  Park told Rush
that Garcia told him that he (Garcia) has Balleweg’s personnel package because
Balleweg gave it to him.  Rush Decl.,
¶26.  Personnel in those days were
permitted to check out their own personnel packages, so it is possible that
Balleweg checked out his personnel package and did not return it to LAPD.  Rush Decl., ¶26.  See Park Decl., ¶¶ 3-6 (Garcia said he
obtained many documents from Balleweg, who took his own personnel file before
he left LAPD).
            On January 3, 2024, the
team requested a status for addenda records from IAG.  Rush Decl., ¶27.  The addenda for seven complaints could not be
located.  Rush Decl., ¶27.
            On February 2, 2024, Rush
checked LAPD resources to attempt to locate arrest reports for two DR numbers
but could not locate any records.  Rush
Decl., ¶28.  Rush then requested
assistance from R&I, which looked through the records on microfilm and
reported on February 27, 2024, that no records were found.  Rush Decl., ¶28.  Rush also pulled the box and searched all
file folders in the box, including files that did not apply to the DR number,
but was unable to locate the missing records. 
Rush Decl., ¶28.
            On February 6, 2024, FID
notified Rush that it had located an OIS Shooting Report they thought she might
be missing but was unable to locate any additional records.  Rush Decl., ¶29.  The record FID found had been previously
produced.  Rush Decl., ¶29.
            On February 29, 2024, Rush
went to the City Clerk's office and reviewed all documents in two boxes to
attempt to locate any additional records or arrest reports related to three
incidents and was unable to find responsive records.  Rush Decl., ¶30.
            On March 8, 2024, Rush contacted
TID to request photographs for multiple DR numbers related to burglaries or
vandalism associated with the Hollywood burglaries, spanning from the 1960s to
the 1980s, in addition to the OIS incidents for which it had been unable to
locate photographs.  Rush Decl.,
¶31.  TID advised that it had located
negatives for 5 of the 13 DR numbers requested. 
Rush Decl., ¶31.  Rush’s team picked
up the scanned and digitized photographs from TID on March 26, 2024.  Rush Decl., ¶31.
            Rush’s team released
additional records to Garcia on August 8, August 15, August 29, September 19,
November 30, and December 13, 2023, and on February 9, February 20, March 14,
March 28, April 15, April 30, May 2, and May 9, 2024.  Rush Decl., ¶32.  On April 3, 2024, Rush’s team re-released the
complaint with added addenda for CF81-1074 and sent the link to Garcia on April
23, 2024.  Rush Decl., ¶32.
            Nearly all the personnel
complaints associated with the officers requested are related to the Hollywood
Burglary incident, which involved multiple officers, numerous victim
businesses, and multiple individual personnel complaints.  Rush Decl., ¶33.  Many of the personnel complaints contained
numerous pages of interviews found in multiple different complaints.  Some of those interviews concerned investigation
inquiries that had nothing to do with the accused allegations.  Rush Decl., ¶36.  It took a long time to determine which
statements, allegations, and officer names needed to be redacted pursuant to Penal
Code sections 832.7(b)(4), (5), and (6). 
Rush Decl., ¶36.  Also, many of
the complaint investigations and addenda included numerous references to victim
business information such as name, address, and phone numbers, which had to be
redacted under Penal Code section 832.7(b)(6). 
Rush Decl., ¶36.  
            For NR #19-234, Rush’s
team has no responsive records for OIS or personnel complaints for Robert Von
Villas or Richard Ford.  Rush Decl.,
¶37.  Rush’s team was unable to locate
the personnel package for Robert Von Villas. 
Rush Decl., ¶37.  Thus, there are
no records remaining to be released for NR #19-234.  Rush Decl., ¶37.
            For NR #19-233, as of
May 13, 2024, Rush’s team have searched for and located all available records
pertaining to the request.  Rush Decl.,
¶38.  Rush’s team is in the process of
redacting photographs for five remaining DR numbers, and reviewing and redacting
complaint numbers 82-102, 82-890, 82-112, 82-651, and arrest reports for
77-332542, 76-064311, 76-24 640721.  Rush
Decl., ¶38.  These are the only records
remaining to be released.  Rush Decl.,
¶38.
 
            Records Produced
            Since May 2023,
the SB 1421 Unit has gone through at least 26 boxes searching for records
related to Garcia's requests.  Rush
Decl., ¶39.  This is in addition to the
numerous boxes and personnel packages searched by IAG, FID, PD, and CIRD since
receiving Garcia's requests in 2019.  Rush Decl., ¶39.  LAPD has spent approximately 1,500 to 2,000
hours on Garcia’s requests since 2019, including searching for records,
reviewing the records, and determining if they qualify for disclosure, and
making redactions.  Rush Decl., ¶39.  LAPD spent approximately 500-600 hours
searching for the records, 525-700 hours reviewing records to determine whether
they were subject to disclosure, and 600-800 hours redacting records for
disclosure.  Rush Decl., ¶39.  
To date, LAPD has
released approximately 1,590 pages to Garcia, consisting of 1099 pages of
personnel complaints and 491 pages of OIS records.  Rush Decl., ¶40.
 
E. Analysis
Petitioner Garcia seeks (a) a declaration that the City and
LAPD violated the CPRA by improperly denying requests and delaying access to
records and (b) mandamus compelling LAPD to complete production within two
months from the date of the instant hearing.[5] 
 
1. Requests
Not Within Scope of Petition
Garcia presents evidence concerning three requests not
within the scope of the Petition.  See
Pet. Op. Br. at 9-12.  For these
three requests, he seeks a declaration that the City and LAPD failed to
properly respond or improperly denied the requests and an order that the City
and LAPD to produce all responsive records within 30 days.  Pet. Op. Br. at 21.
Specifically, in NR 19-5731, Garcia requested
“electronic messages and communication records regarding Request 19-233 and
19-234 from January 13 to the present…” and “records regarding the LAPD policy
of requesting an extension of time with respect to Government Code section 6253(c),
including but not limited to the LAPD manual section regarding CPRA extension
of time; and any and all records and/or letters to Sergio Garcia requesting an
extension of time.”  
In NR
23-3574, Garcia requested SB
1421 OIS records relating to Michael Shubin, Ronald Lawrence Venegas, Peter
Chryss, and Jack Meyers, OIS records for the officer requested in NR 19-233 and 19-234, and
any records from FID and IAD “for the reason of intentionally delaying and
refusing to comply to Requesters Request 19-233 and 19-234…”  
In NR
23-5251, Garcia requested records of “the TMU case file” referenced in an
email he had received, “records of the background investigation” conducted on
himself, “records of all the TMU LAPD command staff, detectives or police
officers involved in the background investigation,” and “personnel complaint
records on all the TMU command staff, detectives or police involved in the TMU
complete workup.”  
The City is correct that Garcia cannot litigate issues or
seek relief regarding records not raised in the Petition. CCP 580(a) (“The relief
granted to the plaintiff . . . cannot exceed that demanded in the complaint”).  Tsemetzin v. Coast Fed.
Savings Loan Assn., (1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 1334, 1342.  As such, the court need not address requests NR 19-5731, NR 23-3574, and
NR 23-5251.  See Opp. at 16-18.
 
2. The Timing of Disclosure
Upon receiving a request for a copy of public records, the agency
shall determine within ten days whether the request seeks public records in the
possession of the agency that are subject to disclosure, though that deadline
may be extended up to 14 days for “unusual circumstances.” (§7922.535(a), (b))
(former §6253(c)).  If the agency
determines that the request for records is denied in whole or in part, the
agency must respond in writing and justify withholding any record by
demonstrating that the record is exempt or that the facts of the case the
public interest served by not disclosing clearly outweighs the public interest
in disclosure.  §§ 7922.540, 7922.000 (former
§6255(a)).
If the agency determines that the requested records are
subject to disclosure, it shall make the records promptly available upon
payment of fees for direct costs of duplication or a statutory fee, if
applicable.  §7911.530.  There is no deadline expressed in a number of
days for producing the records.  Rather, section
7911.530 says the agency “shall make the records promptly available.” Section
7922.500 (former §6253(d)) provides that nothing in the CPRA “shall be
construed to permit an agency to delay or obstruct the inspection or copying of
public records.”
Garcia argues that the City cannot
creditably claim that LAPD met the CPRA’s requirement to make records “promptly
available” when it has failed to produce responsive SB 1421 records for five years
and six months.  See Marken v.
Santa Monica-Malibu USD, (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1250, 1268 n. 14 (noting “serious
questions” whether a one-month delay complied with the CPRA’s mandate that
agencies make records promptly available to requesters); Pasadena Police
Officers Assn. v. City of Pasadena, (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th
147, 152, n. 3 (the CPRA mandates that records “be provided promptly” and it
was unclear if City’s purposeful delay to allow union to file suit was allowed
under the CPRA).  Merriam Webster’s
dictionary defines “promptly” as “without delay; very quickly or immediately.”  https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/promptly; see also Black’s Law Dictionary (6th ed.
1990) p. 1214 (defining “promptly” as “ready and quick to act as occasion demands”).
 The CPRA thus requires agencies to
produce documents “very quickly,” “immediately,” and/or “without delay,” none
of which could be applied to LAPD’s response or production.  Pet. Op. Br. at 13-14.
Garcia notes that LAPD has argued
that compliance with the SB 1421 requests has been challenging.  Ex. D.  Yet,
the Legislature already considered these concerns and accounted for them in the
CPRA.  In balancing the burdens
associated with the “need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a
voluminous amount of separate and distinct records that are demanded in a
single request,” the Legislature determined that the agency should only have 14
extra days to respond.  §7922.535(a),
(b).  While
agencies have long complained about the burden attendant to compliance with the
CPRA, the courts have held that agencies are required to bear the compliance
burden.  See N. Cal. Police
Practices Project v. Craig, (1979) 90 Cal.App.3d 116, 124 (CPRA
requests “[i]nevitably impose some burden on government agencies”).  Pet. Op. Br. at 15.
Agencies also expressed concern when the Legislature was
passing SB 1421.  These agencies opposed
the bill, stressing the difficulties they would face in making large volumes of
historical records public.  Ex. X.  Despite these clear objections, the
Legislature did not choose to extend the response and production requirements
in the CPRA or make any special allowance to give agencies more time.  If the City and LAPD are unhappy with the
Legislature’s mandate of prompt disclosure, those complaints are properly
directed to the Legislature, not this court. 
See id. at 124 (“[i]f the burden becomes too onerous,
relief must be sought from the Legislature”). 
Pet. Op. Br. at 16.
While the law does not give LAPD additional time for compliance
with SB 1421, Garcia did.  He has waited
for five years and six months, receiving almost no records.  By the time this matter is heard, the
litigation will have been pending for an additional year.  LAPD’s filibustering for years has frustrated
a key aim of transparency laws such as the CPRA.  See Powers v. City of Richmond,
(1995) 10 Cal.4th 85, 118 (George, J. concurring) (CPRA was designed to
promote “disclosure of public information at a time when the material still was
newsworthy or of particular importance to the plaintiff”); NBC Subsidiary
(KNBC-TV), Inc. v. Superior Court, (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178, 1211 (delaying
public access is inconsistent with “utilitarian values”).  Pet. Op. Br. at 16.
In reply, Garcia adds that, on June 27, 2023 date he filed suit,
RMLAD Lt. Quan indicated that there were no responsive, disclosable records located
for 11 of the officers.  Ex. D, p. 2, ¶7.  Only after the lawsuit was filed did LAPD begin
producing some records.  SB 1421 Unit Detective
Rush states that she has been the supervisor of the Unit since approximately
June 2022.   Rush Decl., ¶1.  Therefore, she was not assigned to handle
Garcia’s requests from 2019 thru 2022. 
Det. Rush asserts that a year later, in May 2023, the SB 1421 Unit
“assumed responsibility for conducting another reasonable search for responsive
records related to NR 19-233 and NR 19-234 in May of 2023”.  Rush Decl., ¶8.   Only at that point did the SB 1421 Unit search
at least 26 boxes in addition to the numerous boxes and personnel packages
previously searched by IAG, FID, PD, and CIRD. 
Rush Decl., ¶9.   Reply at 8.
 Detective Rush also asserts
that the SB 1421 Unit began releasing records on March 26, 2020.  Rush Decl., ¶7.  This was 15 months after SB 1421 went into
effect and Garcia made his request.  Detective
Rush’s declaration states that LAPD incurred massive amounts of time on the
requests.  These claims lack a supporting
declaration from RMLAD Detective Escalante, the supervisor handling NR 19-233
and 19-234 during 2019 to 2023.  The City
also omits a declaration from Lt. Quan.  Reply
at 9.
Garcia has a fair argument that the City’s delay was too
long over the period of the following milestones: (a) his requests on January
13, 2019; (b) his phone call with Detective Escalante in June 2019; (c) the
initial release of records on March 26, 2020; (d) Lt. Quan’s statement in June
2023 that there were no more responsive records for 11 of the officers; (e) Detective
Rush taking over in June 2022; and (f) Rush’s’ subsequent more extensive search.  This lengthy delay would violate the CPRA
requirements for an initial response that records are subject to disclosure (§7922.535(a),
(b) (former §6253(c)), for the prompt disclosure of records (§7922.530(a)), and
for estimates for production (§7922.535(a)). 

Nonetheless, the City is correct that there is no remedy for
delayed CPRA compliance other than to file suit.  The CPRA authorizes mandamus or declaratory
relief for requestor “to enforce his or her right to inspect or receive a copy
of any public record or class of public records.”  §7923.000. 
If the court finds that the public official’s decision to refuse
disclosure is not justified, the court shall order the public official to make
the record public.  §7923.110(a). The CPRA remedy is
available only to a person who is seeking disclosure of public records
and only where the public entity is allegedly improperly withholding
those records.  County of Santa Clara,
supra, 171 Cal.App.4th at 126 (emphasis in original).  The CPRA provides no judicial
remedy for any other purpose or entity or a remedy that may be utilized for any
purpose other than to determine whether a particular record or class of records
must be disclosed.”  Id. at 127
(emphasis in original).  See also Rogers
v. Superior Court, (“Rogers”) (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 469,
483 (CPRA “provides no remedy for failure to timely comply with a request for
records).
In City
of Gilroy v. Superior Court, (“City of Gilroy”) (2023) 96
Cal.App.5th 818, the requester sought information about law enforcement
sweeps of homeless encampments.  Id.
at 825.  By the trial court hearing, the
city had complied.  Id. at
833.  The requester argued that the case
was not moot because the trial court had authority to grant declaratory relief
that the city’s past conduct violated the CPRA. 
Id.  The appellate court
noted that the California Supreme Court instructed in Filarsky v. Superior
Court, (2002) 28 Cal.4th 419, 428-29, that “under the [CPRA],
only a person seeking disclosure…may seek a judicial declaration regarding the
agency’s obligation to disclose a document.” 
Id.  The court then cited County
of Santa Clara for the proposition that the sole purpose of a CPRA action
is to permit the expeditious determination of the agency’s obligation to
disclose records.  Id. (citation
omitted).  “Since the CPRA does not
provide for declaratory relief other than to determine a public agency’s obligation
to disclose records, [the requester] may not seek declaratory relief under the
CPRA with respect to the propriety of City’s past conduct in responding to [the
requester’s] public records request.”  Id.  The court added that declaratory relief under
CCP section 1060 is prospective anyway and cannot be used to redress past
wrongs.  Id. at 834.
As in City
of Gilroy, Garcia is complaining about LAPD’s past acts of untimely
disclosure.  These acts are not
remediable by declaratory relief or mandamus. 
If he felt the four-year delay was untimely, his remedy was to file
suit, which he has done.  But he cannot
obtain a declaration that the delay violated the CPRA.
In reply, Garcia argues that this interpretation of the CPRA
provides citizens with no recourse to challenge
public institutions which, like LAPD, repeatedly ignore the deadlines set out
in the CPRA.  Many CPRA provisions
concern the timing and manner of production and the CPRA’s remedial section
explicitly provides authorization for injunctive, declaratory, or writ relief.   Under
the California Constitution, this remedial provision must be broadly construed
because it “furthers the people’s right of access.”   Cal.
Const., art. 1, §3(b)(2); see also City of San Jose, supra, 2
Cal.5th at 617 (when any portion of the CPRA is under review, the “standard
approach to statutory interpretation is augmented by a constitutional imperative”).  Reply at 3.
Garcia attempts to distinguish the statements in County
of Santa Clara, Rodgers, and City of Gilroy as dicta.  He argues that the County of Santa
Clara court rejected an agency’s argument that the plaintiffs could not bring
a taxpayer action under CCP section 526 for the agency’s failure to comply with
the CPRA. 171 Cal.App.4th at 124.  “Nowhere in the CPRA is there any language
that explicitly or implicitly restricts, permits, or precludes any type of
legal action ‘concerning’ public records other than whether a particular record
or class of records must be disclosed.”  Id.
at 130.  The court held that the plaintiff’s
taxpayer claim was not brought under the CPRA and could not be restricted to
its remedies.  The court affirmed the
trial court’s overruling of the agency’s demurrer in favor of the claim that
Santa Clara County municipalities were spending taxpayer funds to enforce
policies that violate the CPRA, such as requiring requesters to state their
purposes in making requests and to provide their names and driver’s licenses.  Id. at 130-31.  Reply at 4-5.
Garcia argues that, in Rogers, the plaintiff made
numerous written and unwritten CPRA requests over a six- month period.  19 Cal.App.4th at 474.  After receiving the requests, the agency made
attempts to comply with the CPRA’s requirements, producing the majority of the
requested information before the lawsuit was filed.  Id.  The appellate court upheld the trial court’s
finding that “the City had produced the records requested in a reasonably
timely manner.” Id.  The dicta
in Rogers is also of limited value because it predates the
passage of Proposition 59, which requires that the CPRA, along with its
remedial provisions, be read broadly in favor of public access.  Cal. Const., art. I, §3.  Reply at 5.
It is true that County of Santa Clara held that the CPRA
did not foreclose plaintiffs from bringing a taxpayer action under CCP section
526 for the agency’s failure to comply with the CPRA. 171 Cal.App.4th
at 124.  The court’s discussion of CPRA
remedies is dicta, but it also pointed out that the California Supreme
Court case of Filarksy v. Superior Court, supra, 28 Cal.4th
at 128, which held that an agency cannot file a CPRA action, expressly stated
that “[t]he sole purpose of [a CPRA] action is to permit the expeditious
“determination of the obligation to disclose records requested from a public
agency….”  Id. at 128 (citation
omitted).  Moreover, the statement in Rogers
that the CPRA provides no remedies other than to compel compliance with a
request for records is not dictum; the court found that the agency had
complied, and therefore the timeliness issue was mooted.  19 Cal.App.4th at 483.  The issue would not be moot if historical
compliance were still at issue.  Finally,
and most important, Garcia makes no effort to distinguish City of Gilroy,
which held that the requester may not seek declaratory relief under the CPRA
with respect to the propriety of an agency’s past conduct in responding to the
CPRA request.  The City of Gilroy
holding is binding on this court.
Garcia also argues that California courts frequently deal
with questions of compliance with the CPRA’s mandates that do not involve the
question of whether a particular record is exempt from disclosure.  See, e.g., Community Youth Athletic
Center v. City of National City, (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 1385,
1425-1430 (defendant violated CPRA by failing to conduct a reasonable search);  North County Parents Organization v.
Department of Education, (1994)
23 Cal.App.4th 144, 148 (petitioner entitled to declaration about the cost of obtaining
a copy of requested documents);  National Lawyers Guild, San Francisco Bay Area
Chapter v. City of Hayward, (2020) 9 Cal.5th 488, 492 (cost of
redaction not chargeable to requester); Sierra Club v. Superior Court,
(2013) 57 Cal.4th 157, 161-62 (database of land parcels in geographic
information system file format was disclosable public record).  Reply at 4.
All these cases are consistent with the holdings in County of Santa Clara and City of Gilroy
that the CPRA provides no judicial remedy for any purpose other
than to determine whether a particular record or class of records must be
disclosed.  Each concerned the
forward-looking process of disclosure of a type of record, the need to search
for more records, or the cost of producing the record.  None supports a conclusion that relief is
available for an historical violation of the CPRA.
Finally, Garcia argues that “recent” decisions have found
that production is insufficient to moot questions presented regarding other
statutory relief or an agency’s compliance with the statute, citing a a case
involving attorney fees (Galbiso v. Orosi Public Utility District, (2008)
167 Cal.App.4th 1063, 1087), a case denying mootness because it was made under CRC
6.702 and not the CPRA (Orange County Employees Association, Inc. v.
Superior Court of Orange County (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 287, 294), a
case denying mootness after records were disclosed before mandamus heard in
court of appeal because attorney fees would be at issue (Fairley v. Superior
Court, (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1414, 1419), and a non-binding federal
district court case.  Reply at 6.  None of these cases has any bearing on the holding
in City of Gilroy.
Garcia has no remedy for untimely compliance other than his
lawsuit to compel compliance.  
 
3. The
Reasonableness of the Search and Records to be Disclosed
Garcia’s opening brief does not challenge the reasonableness
of LAPD’s search under Detective Rush. 
Nor does he challenge any of LAPD’s redactions.[6]  Instead, Garcia makes only a general argument
that LAPD refused to turn over SB 1421 records.  The City states that it has disclosed or is in
the process of disclosing all records that do not meet an exemption for NR 19-233 and NR
19-234.  Rush Decl., ¶39.[7]  Garcia has not identified records that he
believes LAPD has located and is withholding. 
Garcia does not meet his burden by generally claiming that the City is
withholding SB 1421
records. 
Garcia argues that the identities and work assignments of
officers are public and cannot be hidden by unsupported claims of exemptions.  He requested under SB 1421 any OIS for the 15
former LAPD officers.  While the officers
may have been ultimately investigated and possibly disciplined for their
conduct in connection with an incident, the names or the fact that they are SB
1421 OIS are not “records generated in connection with the that
appraisal or discipline….” Long Beach Police Officers Assn. v. City of Long
Beach, (“Long Beach”) (2014) 59 Cal.4th 59, 71; see
also New York Times Co. v. Superior Court, (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 97,
99 (CPRA mandated disclosure of the names of peace officers who fired shots at
a citizen); 91 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 11, 16–17 (2008) (“a response to a request
just for the names of officers involved in a particular incident may be
provided without revealing any investigatory or disciplinary matter that may
have arisen out of the incident”).  The
officer’s name is part of the factual information that must be disclosed.   Long
Beach supra 59 Cal.4th at 72.  California law requires that uniformed peace
officers wear identification. Penal Code § 830.10.  LAPD policy requires that officers must
possess business cards, which must be presented to member of the public on
request.  Those business cards include
the complete name of the officer, as well as the “Area/division or detail to
which they are assigned.”  Ex. DD, p. 4 (Department
Manual). Pet. Op. Br. at 19-20.
It is not clear why Garcia makes this argument about officer
identity.  He does not allege that the
City has withheld identities and work assignments of any officers.  
Garcia provides evidence that he possesses files containing
“SB 1421 records of the
thirteen officers” from his request in NR 19-233, but his possession
of records does not mean LAPD has the same records.  Rush’s
team was unable to locate the personnel package for Joseph Balleweg.  Rush Decl., ¶26.  Many of the personnel packages refer to
Balleweg’s personnel package; notes in several of the other officers’ personnel
packages stated “full complaint in Balleweg's package.”  Rush Decl., ¶26.  Park told Rush that Garcia told him that he
(Garcia) has Balleweg’s personnel package because Balleweg gave it to him.  Rush Decl., ¶26.  Personnel in those days were permitted to
check out their own personnel packages, so it is possible that Balleweg checked
out his personnel package and did not return it to LAPD.  Rush Decl., ¶26.  See Park Decl., ¶¶ 3-6 (Garcia said he
obtained many documents from Balleweg, who took his own personnel file before
he left LAPD).
Garcia replies that on June 18, 2019, he provided Detective
Escalante with SB 1421 records containing IAD case files of former LAPD
Sergeant Balleweg that also contained case files of the 12 former LAPD
officers.  Garcia Decl., ¶6.  The IAD case files that Detective Rush
asserted she could not verify remarkably were later authenticated by LAPD in
releasing the same records.  On December
14, 2023, in a meet and confer with Park, Petitioner brought 3,500 plus IAD
records of the Hollywood burglary investigation which he allowed Park to
inspect and authenticate.  Park took
extensive notes about Garcia’s cogent objections about the heavy redactions of
SB 1421 records and concerns that LAPD had not produced all SB 1421 records.  Det. Rush refused numerous invitations to
meet and confer with Garcia to resolve and narrow the scope of the search of SB
1421 records and all the outstanding issues in this matter.  Garcia Decl., ¶¶ 27-28.  Reply at 11.
These facts do not undermine Detective Rush’s
declaration.  More important, they fail
to show that LAPD is withholding any particular record or class of records.  Nor do they even suggest that the ultimate
search by Detective Rush’s team was unreasonable.
Garcia does correctly reply that there is no dispute that LAPD
has not produced all nonexempt material.  LAPD also has failed to “state the estimated
date and time when the records will be made available,” and refuses to do so to
this day.  Reply at 9-10.
For NR #19-234, Rush’s
team has no responsive records for OIS or personnel complaints for Robert Von
Villas or Richard Ford.  Rush Decl.,
¶37.  Rush’s team was unable to locate
the personnel package for Robert Von Villas. 
Rush Decl., ¶37.  Thus, there are
no records remaining to be released for NR #19-234.  Rush Decl., ¶37.
            For NR #19-233, as of
May 13, 2024, Rush’s team have searched for and located all available records
pertaining to the request.  Rush Decl.,
¶38.  Rush’s team is in the process of
redacting photographs for five remaining DR numbers, and reviewing and
redacting complaint numbers 82-102, 82-890, 82-112, 82-651, and arrest reports
for 77-332542, 76-064311, 76-24 640721. 
Rush Decl., ¶38.  These are the
only records remaining to be released. 
Rush Decl., ¶38.
The City will be ordered to complete this process and
produce the remaining records to Garcia in 30 days.
 
F. Conclusion
The Petition is mostly
denied.   It is granted in the limited
part that the records identified for NR #19-233 must be produced in appropriate
redacted form within 30 days.
