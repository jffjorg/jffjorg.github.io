And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying the plaintiff's motion to file the opposition to the defendant's motion to enforce settlement under seal without prejudice. The plaintiff's counsel argues that filing the records under seal is necessary to protect confidential information, but the judge notes that the motion does not contain any legal authority to support this argument. The judge also notes that the motion does not contain any argument or evidence on whether a substantial probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed. The judge concludes that the motion does not meet the requirements for sealing a record and therefore denies the motion.
