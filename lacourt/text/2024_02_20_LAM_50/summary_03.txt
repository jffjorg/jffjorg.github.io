Significant Statements:
  - "We recognize that the Gherman court relied, in part, for its conception of 'bad faith,' on the premise that delay only may constitute the requisite bad faith to preclude the granting of the request to file a cross-complaint when it appears that a delayed cross-complaint, if allowed, would work a substantial injustice to the opposing party and would prejudice that party's position in some way." (Foot's Transfer & Storage Co. v. Superior Court, supra, 114 Cal.App.3d at p. 903)
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion related to the filing of a cross-complaint. The judge is noting that the concept of "bad faith" was previously considered in the Gherman court, which held that delay alone may constitute bad faith and prevent the filing of a cross-complaint. The judge is also citing the Silver Orgs court, which rejected arguments that a cross-complaint was not properly filed. The judge is emphasizing that Code of Civil Procedure section 426.30, subdivision (a) prohibits a party from asserting a related cause of action in a subsequent action if it was not pleaded in a cross-complaint. The judge is tentatively ruling that the party against whom the complaint was filed may not assert the related cause of action in a subsequent action, as it was not properly pleaded in the cross-complaint.
