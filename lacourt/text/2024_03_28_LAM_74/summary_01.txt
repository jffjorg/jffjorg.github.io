And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on defendant PIH Health Downey Hospital's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. The plaintiff, Courtney Patterson, alleges that the defendant retaliated against her for participating in an investigation into a colleague's conduct.

The judge grants the defendant's motion for summary adjudication on the first cause of action, alleging workplace disparate treatment, as the defendant has met its burden of showing that the suspension and termination were not motivated by Patterson's race.

The judge denies the defendant's motion for summary adjudication on the second, third, and fourth causes of action, alleging FEHA retaliation, failure to prevent discrimination and retaliation, and wrongful termination in violation of public policy, respectively. The judge finds that there are triable issues of material fact regarding whether the defendant terminated Patterson in retaliation for her complaint about suspected retaliation.

The judge also denies the defendant's motion for summary adjudication on the issue of punitive damages, finding that the defendant has not met its burden of showing that it did not have advance knowledge of the alleged misconduct or authorize or ratify it.

The case will proceed to a hearing on March 28, 2024, where the judge will issue a final ruling.
