## English Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving Waring Plaza Properties (Waring) and Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, LLP (Manatt). Waring sued Manatt for professional negligence, breach of contract, and other claims. Manatt filed a cross-complaint against Waring, alleging various claims including breach of contract, open book account, and implied-in-fact contract.

The judge ruled that Waring's demurrer (a legal objection) to Manatt's first and second causes of action in the cross-complaint is **overruled**. This means Manatt can proceed with those claims. However, the judge sustained the demurrer to Manatt's fourth cause of action (breach of implied-in-fact contract) **without leave to amend**.  This means Manatt cannot make that claim anymore unless it can provide new information that addresses the judge's concerns.

The judge found that there are factual disputes regarding the existence and validity of a fee agreement between Waring and Manatt, and whether Manatt can recover on an open book account claim based on its billing practices. Ultimately, the judge decided that Manatt cannot allege a valid breach of implied-in-fact contract without proving the existence of a valid agreement, which requires a written contract according to California law.

English text:
The tentative ruling in case number 23STCV08297, to be heard on September 18, 2023 in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, overrules Waring Plaza Properties, L.P.'s demurrer to Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, LLP's first and second causes of action in their cross-complaint, and sustains, without leave to amend, Waring's demurrer to the fourth cause of action. The ruling is based on a dispute over a fee agreement and allegations of breach of contract, open book account, quantum meruit, and implied-in-fact contract. The court disagrees with Waring's argument that the fee agreement is void and that Manatt cannot maintain a claim for breach of the agreement. The court also finds that Manatt is not precluded from asserting an open book account claim based on attorney billing records and that there are issues of fact as to whether or not Manatt can be said to have maintained an account. Additionally, the court states that there is nothing impermissibly inconsistent about maintaining a claim for both breach of contract and open book account. However, the court sustains Waring's demurrer as to the fourth cause of action, as Business and Professions Code section 6148(a) states that the contract for services in the case shall be in writing.

## Case Summary

**Case Number:** 23STCV08297
**Hearing Date:** September 18, 2023
**Department:** 17, Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles

**Plaintiff:** Waring Plaza Properties, L.P.
**Defendant:** Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, LLP and Benjamin G. Shatz

**Summary:**

This case involves a lawsuit filed by Waring Plaza Properties (Waring) against Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, LLP and Benjamin G. Shatz (collectively, Defendants) alleging professional negligence, breach of implied contract, and common counts. Defendants filed a cross-complaint against Waring alleging breach of written contract, open book account, quantum meruit, and breach of implied-in-fact contract.

Waring demurred to Manatt's cross-complaint, specifically challenging the first, second, and fourth causes of action.  

**Judge's Ruling:**

* **First and Second Causes of Action (Breach of Written Contract and Open Book Account):**  The judge OVERRULED the demurrer. The judge determined that whether the fee agreement is void is a factual issue not suitable for resolution at the pleading stage.
* **Fourth Cause of Action (Breach of Implied-in-Fact Contract):** The judge SUSTAINED the demurrer without leave to amend. The judge ruled that Business and Professions Code section 6148(a) mandates that contracts for legal services be in writing, and Manatt failed to allege sufficient facts to demonstrate a valid implied-in-fact contract. 

**Significant Statements:**

*  The judge highlighted the "liberal rules of pleading" that allow inconsistent allegations and the possibility of pleading both breach of contract and open book account claims.
*  The judge emphasized that the existence of a contract, even if implied, must be supported by appropriate legal grounds and factual allegations.

**Next Steps:**

The matter will be heard on September 18, 2023. Parties have the option to submit on the tentative ruling by email or appear at the hearing. 



## English Summary

The judge has decided on Waring Plaza Properties' request to dismiss parts of Manatt, Phelps & Phillips' counterclaim. 

The judge ruled against Waring's attempt to dismiss Manatt's claims for breach of contract and open book account. These claims, according to the judge, can proceed because questions of fact remain regarding the validity of the contract between the parties. 

However, the judge sided with Waring and dismissed Manatt's claim for breach of an implied-in-fact contract.  The judge cited a California law requiring contracts for legal services to be in writing and found that Manatt failed to provide enough information to support their claim of an unwritten agreement.

* The court finds that whether or not the fee agreement is void is a factual determination not properly made at the pleading stage.
* The court agrees that Waring Plaza Properties is correct that a mere recording in a book of transactions or the incidental keeping of accounts under an express contract does not of itself create a book account.
* The court finds that Manatt, Phelps & Phillips is not precluded, as a matter of law, from asserting an open book account claim based on attorney billing records.
* The court sustains Waring Plaza Properties' demurrer to the fourth cause of action, alleging breach of implied-in-fact contract, as Manatt, Phelps & Phillips must allege facts which could show that they could enter into a valid agreement for legal services that was implied-in-fact, rather than in writing.

The Judge disagrees with Plaintiff's argument that Defendants cannot state a claim for breach of written contract, open book account, and implied-in-fact contract. The Judge clarifies that the validity of the fee agreement is a factual determination, and Defendants are not precluded from asserting an open book account claim based on attorney billing records. The Judge also notes that maintaining a claim for both breach of contract and open book account is not impermissibly inconsistent. Finally, the Judge states that the fact that another party alleges the existence of a contract cannot save that contract if it is barred as a matter of law.
