## English Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving Waring Plaza Properties (Waring) and Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, LLP (Manatt). Waring sued Manatt for professional negligence, breach of contract, and other claims. Manatt filed a cross-complaint against Waring, alleging various claims including breach of contract, open book account, and implied-in-fact contract.

The judge ruled that Waring's demurrer (a legal objection) to Manatt's first and second causes of action in the cross-complaint is **overruled**. This means Manatt can proceed with those claims. However, the judge sustained the demurrer to Manatt's fourth cause of action (breach of implied-in-fact contract) **without leave to amend**.  This means Manatt cannot make that claim anymore unless it can provide new information that addresses the judge's concerns.

The judge found that there are factual disputes regarding the existence and validity of a fee agreement between Waring and Manatt, and whether Manatt can recover on an open book account claim based on its billing practices. Ultimately, the judge decided that Manatt cannot allege a valid breach of implied-in-fact contract without proving the existence of a valid agreement, which requires a written contract according to California law.

English text:
The tentative ruling in case number 23STCV08297, to be heard on September 18, 2023 in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, overrules Waring Plaza Properties, L.P.'s demurrer to Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, LLP's first and second causes of action in their cross-complaint, and sustains, without leave to amend, Waring's demurrer to the fourth cause of action. The ruling is based on a dispute over a fee agreement and allegations of breach of contract, open book account, quantum meruit, and implied-in-fact contract. The court disagrees with Waring's argument that the fee agreement is void and that Manatt cannot maintain a claim for breach of the agreement. The court also finds that Manatt is not precluded from asserting an open book account claim based on attorney billing records and that there are issues of fact as to whether or not Manatt can be said to have maintained an account. Additionally, the court states that there is nothing impermissibly inconsistent about maintaining a claim for both breach of contract and open book account. However, the court sustains Waring's demurrer as to the fourth cause of action, as Business and Professions Code section 6148(a) states that the contract for services in the case shall be in writing.
