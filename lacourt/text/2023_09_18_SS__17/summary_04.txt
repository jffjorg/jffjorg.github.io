And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, LLP's cross-complaint. The demurrer was filed by Waring Plaza Properties, L.P. and argues that Manatt cannot state a claim for breach of written contract, open book account, and implied-in-fact contract. The judge disagrees and finds that Manatt's claims are sufficient to proceed. The judge overrules Waring's demurrer as to the first and second causes of action and sustains it without leave to amend as to the fourth cause of action. The judge's ruling is based on California case law and the laws governing legal services.
