Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the motion for a stay of proceedings filed by the defendants, Allenco Energy Inc., Timothy James Parker, and Clifford E. Peter Allen. The defendants argued that the civil proceeding should be stayed pending the outcome of the ongoing criminal matter against them. The judge disagreed, citing the California Supreme Court's holding that the fact of an indictment does not give a defendant a blanket check to block all civil litigation on the same or related subject matter. The judge noted that the civil and criminal proceedings have overlapping issues, but also have distinct issues that are not implicated by the criminal proceeding. The judge concluded that a blanket stay would prejudice the plaintiff and the fair prosecution of her case, and therefore denied the motion.
