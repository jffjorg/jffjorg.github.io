```

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the motion for a stay of proceedings filed by the defendants, Allenco Energy Inc., Timothy James Parker, and Clifford E. Peter Allen. The defendants argued that the civil proceeding should be stayed pending the outcome of the ongoing criminal matter against them. The judge disagreed, citing the California Supreme Court's holding that the fact of an indictment does not give a defendant a blanket check to block all civil litigation on the same or related subject matter. The judge noted that the civil and criminal proceedings have overlapping issues, but also have distinct issues that are not implicated by the criminal proceeding. The judge concluded that a blanket stay would prejudice the plaintiff and the fair prosecution of her case, and therefore denied the motion.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the moving defendants' motion for a stay of proceedings pending the outcome of the ongoing criminal case. The court disagrees with the defendants' argument that a stay is necessary to avoid the risk of self-incrimination, citing the California Supreme Court's holding that a civil lawsuit can proceed even if a criminal case is pending. The court notes that the criminal case and the civil case have different underlying facts and concerns, and that the civil case is nearing trial. The court also finds that the moving defendants have failed to demonstrate that the discovery process in the civil case will implicate their Fifth Amendment privilege. Finally, the court concludes that a blanket stay of proceedings would substantially prejudice the plaintiff and the fair prosecution of her case.

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the moving defendants' motion for a stay of proceedings in the case initiated by Plaintiff Nalleli Cobo-Uriarte against Allenco Energy Inc., Timothy James Parker, Clifford E. Peter Allen, St. James Oil Corporation, and the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. The Judge disagrees with the moving defendants' argument that there is a risk of self-incrimination as they are required to participate in discovery in this civil action while the criminal case against them is pending. The Judge cites the California Supreme Court's ruling that there is no constitutional right to postpone a civil proceeding because of a parallel criminal proceeding. The Judge also notes that the criminal investigation into and prosecution of the moving defendants arises from the same or related transactions as this action, but the extent of the overlap is disputed. The Judge orders that the deposition and production of documents move forward, and the moving defendants can assert the privilege specifically where appropriate. The Judge denies the motion to avoid substantial prejudice to the plaintiff and ensure the fair prosecution of her case.

Case Number: 20STCV49421
Hearing Date: September 18, 2023
Dept: 17, Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles

**Parties:**

- Nalleli Cobo-Uriarte (Plaintiff)
- Allenco Energy Inc., Timothy James Parker, Clifford E. Peter Allen, St. James Oil Corporation, and the Archdiocese of Los Angeles (Defendants)

**Factual Background:**

- On August 3, 2020, the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office (LACA) filed a criminal Complaint against Allenco Energy Inc., Timothy James Parker, and Clifford E. Peter Allen (Moving Defendants).
- The criminal case is ongoing, and Moving Defendants are required to appear on October 20, 2020, to answer 25 misdemeanor criminal charges.
- Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint on September 3, 2021, alleging negligence and strict liability for ultrahazardous activity.
- Allenco Energy Inc. allegedly polluted a residential neighborhood for years, forcing it to shut down the facility in 2013 due to high levels of contaminants.
- Plaintiff was diagnosed with cervical cancer in January 2020 after living near the Allenco site for over a decade.

**Discussion:**

- Moving Defendants seek a stay of proceedings pending the outcome of the parallel criminal matter due to the risk of self-incrimination.
- The Court disagrees, stating there is no constitutional right to postpone civil proceedings due to a parallel criminal proceeding, and simultaneous proceedings are generally unobjectionable.
- Moving Defendants argue that the LACA's criminal investigation arises from the same or related transactions as this action, but Plaintiff disputes this fact.
- Plaintiff's deposition notice seeks documents related to communications, contamination, complaints, and communications with regulatory agencies regarding the site.
- LACA's misdemeanor complaint focuses on Allenco's alleged failure to address nonoperating wells, while this action concerns Allenco's conduct and emissions while operating the facility and initial shutdown steps.
- The Court allows the deposition and production of documents to move forward, with Defendants asserting the privilege where appropriate.

**Conclusion:**

- Moving Defendants' motion for a stay of proceedings is denied.
- A blanket stay would prejudice Plaintiff and increase the danger of prejudice due to lost evidence or the inability of witnesses to recall specific facts.

**Ordered by:** Hon. Jon R. Takasugi, Judge of the Superior Court.
