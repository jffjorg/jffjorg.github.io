**English Text Summary:**

This tentative ruling addresses Attorney Jae Kim's motion to be relieved as counsel for Defendant Janet Lynne Saffari and Cross-Complainant Richard Saffari. 

The judge denies the motion, citing a lack of justification for the timing of the request, particularly given that the trial is set for October 2nd.  The judge states that while conflicts between attorneys and clients are common, the current situation doesn't demonstrate an irreparable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship.  

The judge ultimately finds that the potential harm to the case from relieving counsel at this late stage outweighs any potential harm from keeping Kim as counsel.

And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies Attorney Jae Kim's motions to be relieved as counsel for Defendant Janet Lynne Saffari and Cross-Complainant Richard Saffari. Kim has brought two motions, citing conflicts and disagreements with his clients, but the judge finds that Kim's declaration does not explain why he has only just now sought relief, on the eve of trial. The judge also finds that the disagreements between Kim and his clients do not amount to an irreparable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. As a result, the risk of prejudice if Kim were relieved outweighs any potential prejudice if Kim is not relieved, and the motions are denied.

## Case Summary: 22STCV14367

**Case Number:** 22STCV14367
**Hearing Date:** September 18, 2023
**Department:** 17
**Court:** Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles

**Parties:**

* **Plaintiff:** Karen Jean Ziegenbein
* **Defendant:** Janet Lynne Saffari
* **Cross-Complainant:** Richard Saffari

**People-Names:**

* Karen Jean Ziegenbein
* Janet Lynne Saffari
* Richard Saffari
* Jae Kim (Attorney)
* Jon R. Takasugi (Judge)

**Legal Actions:**

* Attorney Jae Kim filed two motions to be relieved as counsel for Defendant Janet Lynne Saffari and Cross-Complainant Richard Saffari.

**Reasons for Motion:**

* Attorney Kim cites "many conflicts and disagreements related to legal issues and the direction of this case," and that the clients do not always acknowledge the non-applicability of certain legal issues.

**Judge's Ruling:**

* **Tentative Ruling:** Motions to withdraw are DENIED.

**Judge's Reasoning:**

* While motions to withdraw are generally granted if properly filed, the court considers the timing of the motion (on the eve of trial), lack of explanation for the delay, and insufficient evidence of an irreparable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship.
* The risk of prejudice to the parties if the attorney is relieved outweighs the potential prejudice if he remains.

**Next Steps:**

* Parties can submit on the tentative ruling by emailing the court by 4 p.m. the day before the hearing.
* If all parties submit, the tentative ruling becomes the final order.
* If no submissions are received, the motion may be removed from the calendar.


## English Summary:

Judge Takasugi denied Attorney Jae Kim's motions to withdraw from representing Defendant Janet Lynne Saffari and Cross-Complainant Richard Saffari.  The Judge found that Kim waited too long to file the motions, just before the scheduled trial date, and did not provide a strong enough reason for the delay. The Judge also determined that Kim's claims of disagreements with his clients were not sufficient to demonstrate a complete breakdown in their relationship. The Judge believes that removing Kim from the case at this late stage would be more harmful to the parties than keeping him on, especially given the upcoming trial.

**Case Number:** 22STCV14367

**Plaintiff:** Karen Jean Ziegenbein

**Defendant:** Janet Lynne Saffari

**People-Names:** Jae Kim, Jon R. Takasugi

**Dates:** Hearing Date: September 18, 2023; Trial Date: October 2, 2023

**Events:** Jae Kim's motions to be relieved as counsel are denied

**Disputes:** Conflicts and disagreements between Jae Kim and the defendants

**Acts:** Jae Kim's declaration of ongoing conflicts and disagreements

**Agreements:** None mentioned in the summary

**Laws:** Code Civ. Proc., § 284(2)

**Case Citations:** None mentioned in the summary

**Statutes:** Not applicable

**Roles:** Jae Kim is the attorney for the defendants; Jon R. Takasugi is the Judge

**Significant Statements:** Despite the ongoing conflicts, Kim's motion to be relieved as counsel is denied due to the risk of prejudice if he were relieved and the insufficiency of the defendants' disagreements as a reason for an irreparable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship.

This tentative ruling denies Jae Kim's motions to be relieved as counsel for the defendants, Janet Lynne Saffari and Richard Saffari, in the case brought by the plaintiff, Karen Jean Ziegenbein. Kim's declaration of many conflicts and disagreements related to legal issues and the direction of the case is not sufficient to allow him to withdraw as counsel. The trial is set for October 2, 2023, and Kim's declaration does not offer any explanation as to why he has only just now, on the eve of trial, moved to be relieved. The risk of prejudice if Kim were relieved outweighs any potential prejudice if he is not relieved. Therefore, the motions are denied.
