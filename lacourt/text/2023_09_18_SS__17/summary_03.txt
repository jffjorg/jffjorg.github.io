**English Text Summary:**

This tentative ruling addresses Attorney Jae Kim's motion to be relieved as counsel for Defendant Janet Lynne Saffari and Cross-Complainant Richard Saffari. 

The judge denies the motion, citing a lack of justification for the timing of the request, particularly given that the trial is set for October 2nd.  The judge states that while conflicts between attorneys and clients are common, the current situation doesn't demonstrate an irreparable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship.  

The judge ultimately finds that the potential harm to the case from relieving counsel at this late stage outweighs any potential harm from keeping Kim as counsel.

And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies Attorney Jae Kim's motions to be relieved as counsel for Defendant Janet Lynne Saffari and Cross-Complainant Richard Saffari. Kim has brought two motions, citing conflicts and disagreements with his clients, but the judge finds that Kim's declaration does not explain why he has only just now sought relief, on the eve of trial. The judge also finds that the disagreements between Kim and his clients do not amount to an irreparable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. As a result, the risk of prejudice if Kim were relieved outweighs any potential prejudice if Kim is not relieved, and the motions are denied.

The tentative ruling by Judge Jon R. Takasugi denies attorney Jae Kim's motion to be relieved as counsel for defendant Janet Lynne Saffari and cross-complainant Richard Saffari. Despite the claimed ongoing conflicts and disagreements, Kim's motion was submitted on the eve of trial without a valid explanation. The potential prejudice of relieving Kim outweighs any potential prejudice if he is not relieved. The ruling will be adopted as the final order if all parties submit.
