And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies Attorney Jae Kim's motions to be relieved as counsel for Defendant Janet Lynne Saffari and Cross-Complainant Richard Saffari. Kim claims that there have been ongoing conflicts and disagreements with his clients regarding legal issues and case direction, but provides no explanation for his delayed motion to be relieved. The court finds that the risk of prejudice if Kim were relieved outweighs any potential prejudice if Kim is not relieved, and therefore denies the motions. The trial is set for October 2, 2023.
