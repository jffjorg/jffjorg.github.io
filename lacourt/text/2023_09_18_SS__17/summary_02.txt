**English Summary:**

This tentative ruling addresses a motion by PCH Treatment, Inc. to compel further discovery responses from Terry Krekorian, the plaintiff in this case.  

Krekorian filed a lawsuit against PCH and Jeffrey D. Ball, alleging judicial dissolution, accounting, and breach of fiduciary duty. PCH sought further responses to interrogatories and requests for production.  

The court found that while there were initial delays, Krekorian ultimately provided the requested supplemental responses in good faith. The delays were attributed to Plaintiff's counsel experiencing medical issues. 

Therefore, the court denies PCH's motion to compel further responses as moot and declines to award sanctions against Krekorian.

However, the judge found that Krekorian had provided some additional responses and that the delays in discovery were due to his counsel's medical issues, which the court was aware of. The judge also noted that Krekorian had acted in good faith to comply with his discovery obligations. As a result, the judge denied PCH's motion and declined to award sanctions at this time.
