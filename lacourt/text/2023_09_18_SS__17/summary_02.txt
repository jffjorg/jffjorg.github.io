And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling is that PCH's motion to compel further responses to its Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Production is DENIED. The Court also declines to award sanctions at this time. The Plaintiff had filed a suit against PCH and Jeffrey D. Ball alleging judicial dissolution, accounting, and breach of fiduciary duty. PCH moved to compel further responses, claiming that the Plaintiff's responses to certain requests were insufficient. The Plaintiff provided supplemental responses, and the Court finds that the motion is moot. Additionally, the Court finds that the delays in discovery were due to the Plaintiff's counsel experiencing medical issues, and therefore sanctions are not warranted.
