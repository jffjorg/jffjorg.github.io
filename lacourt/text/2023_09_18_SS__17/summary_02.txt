PCH moved to compel further responses, claiming that the Plaintiff's responses to certain requests were insufficient. The Plaintiff provided supplemental responses, and the Court finds that the motion is moot. Additionally, the Court finds that the delays in discovery were due to the Plaintiff's counsel experiencing medical issues, and therefore sanctions are not warranted.

**English Summary:**

This tentative ruling addresses a motion by PCH Treatment, Inc. to compel further discovery responses from Terry Krekorian, the plaintiff in this case.  

Krekorian filed a lawsuit against PCH and Jeffrey D. Ball, alleging judicial dissolution, accounting, and breach of fiduciary duty. PCH sought further responses to interrogatories and requests for production.  

The court found that while there were initial delays, Krekorian ultimately provided the requested supplemental responses in good faith. The delays were attributed to Plaintiff's counsel experiencing medical issues. 

Therefore, the court denies PCH's motion to compel further responses as moot and declines to award sanctions against Krekorian.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied PCH Treatment, Inc.'s motion to compel further responses from Terry Krekorian, the plaintiff, to its discovery requests. The motion was filed because PCH claimed that Krekorian's responses to its requests for information were insufficient. However, the judge found that Krekorian had provided some additional responses and that the delays in discovery were due to his counsel's medical issues, which the court was aware of. The judge also noted that Krekorian had acted in good faith to comply with his discovery obligations. As a result, the judge denied PCH's motion and declined to award sanctions at this time.
