And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling states that the court has identified several deficiencies in the plaintiff's default judgment packet. The court finds that the unsigned agreement submitted to prove the formation of a media company is insufficient, and that the plaintiff has not provided evidence to show that the parties finalized the company's operating agreement. The court also finds that the plaintiff has not submitted evidence to show that she was entitled to a 10% ownership stake in the LLC and NFT assets, or that the company actually owned the Ape NFTs. The court further finds that the plaintiff has not provided evidence to support her claim that Mr. Costello altered the management agreement, and that she has not explained why she is entitled to recover the assets at their market high of April 2022, as opposed to their current value. The court also requests that the plaintiff submit paystubs and redacted bank records to corroborate her claims about what she was paid. Finally, the court finds that the plaintiff's claim that Mr. Govea valued the company to investors at least $5,000,000.00 is unsupported and without foundation.
