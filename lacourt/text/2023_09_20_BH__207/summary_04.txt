And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Blue Lake Capital v. Amanda Moore. The plaintiff has moved for an order compelling the defendant to respond to discovery requests, including special interrogatories, form interrogatories, requests for production of documents, and requests for admission. The defendant has failed to respond to these requests in a timely and substantive manner.

The judge finds that the plaintiff has made a reasonable and good-faith attempt to resolve the discovery disputes through informal means, and that the defendant has not opposed the motions. Therefore, the judge grants the plaintiff's motions to compel further responses and orders the defendant to serve further verified and code-compliant responses to the discovery requests within 20 days.

The judge also imposes monetary sanctions on the defendant in the amount of $3040.00, which represents eight hours of attorney time to prepare the moving papers and attend the hearing, plus filing fees. The defendant is ordered to pay this amount to the plaintiff within 20 days.

Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in Markdown format:

**Case Number**: 22SMCV01666
**Plaintiff's Name**: Blue Lake Capital
**Defendant's Name**: Amanda Moore

**Facts**:
* Plaintiff Blue Lake Capital filed a complaint against Defendant Amanda Moore for Intentional Misrepresentation; Breach of Contract; Breach of the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; and Breach of the Duty of Loyalty.
* Plaintiff moves the Court for orders compelling Defendant to serve further responses to Special Interrogatories, Form Interrogatories, Requests for Production of Documents, and Requests for Admission.

**Procedural Requirements**:
* A notice of motion to compel further responses must be filed within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or on or before any specific later date agreed in writing by the parties.
* A meet and confer declaration must be filed, stating facts showing a reasonable and good-faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented in the motion.
* A separate statement must be included with the motion, containing the text of each request, the response, and a statement of factual and legal reasons for why an order compelling further responses is warranted.

**Analysis**:
* The purpose of the discovery rules is to enhance the truth-seeking function of the litigation process and eliminate trial strategies that focus on gamesmanship and surprise.
* Where a party objects or responds inadequately to discovery requests, a motion lies to compel further responses, and the party has the burden to justify the objections or inadequate responses.
* A trial court's determination of a motion to compel discovery is reviewed for abuse of discretion.

**Rulings**:
* Special Interrogatories Nos. 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8: GRANTED
* Form Interrogatories Nos. 15.1 and 216.1: GRANTED
* Requests for Production of Documents Nos. 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 17, and 18: GRANTED
* Requests for Admission Nos. 7 and 8: GRANTED

**Sanctions**:
* The Court will impose monetary sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $3040.00 for Defendant's failure to provide complete, substantive responses to the subject discovery requests without objections.

**Conclusion and Orders**:
* The Court grants Plaintiff's motions to compel further responses and orders Defendant to serve further verified and code compliant responses, without objections, to the Special Interrogatories, Form Interrogatories, Requests for Production of Documents, and Requests for Admission, as noted above, within 20 days of notice of the Court's orders.
* Defendant is ordered to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $3040.00 to Plaintiff, by and through counsel for Plaintiff, within 20 days of notice of the Court's orders.
* Plaintiff shall provide notice of the Court's orders and file a proof of service regarding the same.
