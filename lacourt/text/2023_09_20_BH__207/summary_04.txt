And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Blue Lake Capital v. Amanda Moore. The plaintiff has moved for an order compelling the defendant to respond to discovery requests, including special interrogatories, form interrogatories, requests for production of documents, and requests for admission. The defendant has failed to respond to these requests in a timely and substantive manner.

The judge finds that the plaintiff has made a reasonable and good-faith attempt to resolve the discovery disputes through informal means, and that the defendant has not opposed the motions. Therefore, the judge grants the plaintiff's motions to compel further responses and orders the defendant to serve further verified and code-compliant responses to the discovery requests within 20 days.

The judge also imposes monetary sanctions on the defendant in the amount of $3040.00, which represents eight hours of attorney time to prepare the moving papers and attend the hearing, plus filing fees. The defendant is ordered to pay this amount to the plaintiff within 20 days.
