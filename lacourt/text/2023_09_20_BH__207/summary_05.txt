The court found that there are no triable issues of material fact regarding these claims.

As to the third cause of action, the court found that Sound Equity did not engage in any oppressive, fraudulent, or malicious conduct and that Plaintiff was not a party to the underlying loan agreement.

As to the tenth cause of action, the court found that Plaintiff lacked standing to bring a wrongful foreclosure action because she was not the trustor or mortgagor and did not tender the amount owed on the debt.

As to the claim for punitive damages, the court found that Sound Equity did not engage in any oppressive, fraudulent, or malicious conduct and that there was no evidence to support Plaintiff's claims of oppression, fraud, or malice.

The court ordered Sound Equity to give notice of the ruling and file a proof of service of such.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Sound Equity's motion for summary adjudication as to the third cause of action for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, the tenth cause of action for wrongful foreclosure, and the claim for punitive damages. The judge found that there are no triable issues of material fact regarding these claims.

The judge concluded that Sound Equity has met its burden of production and persuasion that it is entitled to summary adjudication as to the third cause of action for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing. The judge found that Plaintiff has not provided any evidence that she was a party to the underlying loan agreement and that she was not the beneficiary of the loan agreement between Palms and Sound Equity.

The judge also concluded that Sound Equity has met its burden of production and persuasion that Plaintiff lacks standing to bring a wrongful foreclosure action. The judge found that Plaintiff is not the trustor or mortgagor and did not tender the amount owed on the debt.

Finally, the judge concluded that Sound Equity has met its burden of production and persuasion that it was merely the lender who extended a loan at arm's length to Palms, secured by the subject property, and that there is no evidence of "advanced knowledge, approval, or ratification of any malicious, oppressive, or fraudulent conduct."
