And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Cross-complainants' motion for leave to file a proposed amended cross-complaint against MRB Construction, Inc. and Marvin Ramos. The proposed amended cross-complaint adds new causes of action for breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, disgorgement of payments, and express indemnity based on a subcontract agreement between Cross-complainants and MRB. The good faith settlement between Plaintiff and MRB does not bar these new claims, as they are separate and distinct from the original claims. The judge finds that Cross-complainants should have been aware of the facts underlying these new claims at the time they filed the original cross-complaint. Despite the potential prejudice to MRB and Ramos, the judge exercises its discretion to grant the motion and orders Cross-complainants to file and serve the proposed amended cross-complaint on or before September 27, 2023.

Here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the motion for leave to file an amended cross-complaint filed by Cross-complainants Zalman N., Inc. and Zalman T. Nemtzov against MRB Construction, Inc. and Marvin Ramos. The proposed amended cross-complaint alleges new causes of action for breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, disgorgement of payments, and express indemnity based on the subcontract agreement between Cross-complainants and MRB. The judge finds that the good faith settlement between Plaintiff and MRB does not bar these new claims, as they are separate and express contractual claims. The judge also notes that the proposed amendments are untimely, but grants leave to file the amended cross-complaint due to the liberal policy favoring amendment and the public policy to decide cases on the merits. The judge orders Cross-complainants to file and serve the proposed amended cross-complaint on or before September 27, 2023.

## Case Summary:  Tentative Ruling in Case No. 20STCV17331

This tentative ruling concerns a motion by Cross-complainants, Zalman N., Inc. and Zalman T. Nemtzov, to amend their cross-complaint against MRB Construction, Inc. ("MRB") and Marvin Ramos ("Ramos").

**Case Background:**

* The case arises from an accident during the construction of a new home in early 2019. 
* Plaintiff sued the project owners, then amended the complaint to name MRB as the defendant. 
* Cross-complainants, the general contractor and its owner, filed a cross-complaint in November 2021 for indemnity and contribution against MRB, Ramos, and others.
* MRB and Ramos settled with Plaintiff in good faith, and their claims were dismissed with prejudice.
* Trial is scheduled for early November 2023.

**Proposed Amendments:**

Cross-complainants seek to amend their cross-complaint to add four new causes of action against MRB and Ramos:

1. Breach of contract
2. Negligent misrepresentation
3. Disgorgement of payments made to MRB under the subcontract agreement
4. Express indemnity

**Legal Arguments:**

* **Cross-complainants:**  MRB and Ramos denied the existence of a subcontract agreement, delaying their ability to assert these claims. This denial created an impediment to asserting these claims.
* **MRB and Ramos:** The amendments are untimely and prejudicial because they:
    * Impede their ability to conduct discovery and file a summary judgment motion.
    * Force them to bear the full insurance responsibility due to a federal court ruling regarding insurance coverage.

**Judge's Tentative Ruling:**

* The judge is inclined to grant leave to amend due to the liberal policy favoring amendment and the desire to decide cases on the merits.
* The judge recognizes that the proposed amendments are based on an express contract, which is distinct from the dismissed indemnity and contribution claims covered by the good faith settlement.
* The judge will issue orders to manage the trial timeline and address any prejudice to the parties.
*  The judge will allow the parties to address the merits of the proposed amendments through procedural tools like demurrers or motions for judgment on the pleadings.


**Next Steps:**

Cross-complainants must file and serve the amended cross-complaint by September 27, 2023, and provide proof of service.




**Disclaimer:** This is a simplified summary and does not constitute legal advice.
