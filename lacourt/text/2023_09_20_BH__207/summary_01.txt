And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Cross-complainants' motion for leave to file a proposed amended cross-complaint against MRB Construction, Inc. and Marvin Ramos. The proposed amended cross-complaint adds new causes of action for breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, disgorgement of payments, and express indemnity based on a subcontract agreement between Cross-complainants and MRB. The good faith settlement between Plaintiff and MRB does not bar these new claims, as they are separate and distinct from the original claims. The judge finds that Cross-complainants should have been aware of the facts underlying these new claims at the time they filed the original cross-complaint. Despite the potential prejudice to MRB and Ramos, the judge exercises its discretion to grant the motion and orders Cross-complainants to file and serve the proposed amended cross-complaint on or before September 27, 2023.

Here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the motion for leave to file an amended cross-complaint filed by Cross-complainants Zalman N., Inc. and Zalman T. Nemtzov against MRB Construction, Inc. and Marvin Ramos. The proposed amended cross-complaint alleges new causes of action for breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, disgorgement of payments, and express indemnity based on the subcontract agreement between Cross-complainants and MRB. The judge finds that the good faith settlement between Plaintiff and MRB does not bar these new claims, as they are separate and express contractual claims. The judge also notes that the proposed amendments are untimely, but grants leave to file the amended cross-complaint due to the liberal policy favoring amendment and the public policy to decide cases on the merits. The judge orders Cross-complainants to file and serve the proposed amended cross-complaint on or before September 27, 2023.
