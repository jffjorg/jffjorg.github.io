And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the complaint to add a prayer for punitive damages, but only with respect to the second cause of action for fraud. The plaintiff is required to file and serve the amended complaint by October 11, 2023. The judge also orders the plaintiff to provide notice of the court's ruling and file a proof of service of such.

The judge finds that the plaintiff has established a prima facie case for punitive damages, citing voluminous text message evidence that demonstrates Defendant Moghadam and Aesthetic Corp. made fraudulent representations to induce the plaintiff to undergo the medical procedures. The judge also finds that the evidence does not undermine the plaintiff's prima facie case, even though Defendant Moghadam and Aesthetic Corp. presented evidence that they did not commit medical malpractice.

The judge notes that punitive damages are not available for medical negligence and that the plaintiff does not seek punitive damages regarding the medical negligence cause of action. The judge also finds that the proposed amendment will not prejudice the defendant, as the additional expense and inconvenience in defending against the claims is not a significant burden.
