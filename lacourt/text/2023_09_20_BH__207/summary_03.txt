  - "The text message evidence also demonstrates that Defendants made those representations in response to and for the purpose of minimizing Plaintiff's concerns about the potential risks of the procedures, to induce him to undergo the combined procedure."
  - "Plaintiff does not seek punitive damages regarding the medical negligence cause of action."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the complaint to add a prayer for punitive damages, but only with respect to the second cause of action for fraud. The plaintiff is required to file and serve the amended complaint by October 11, 2023. The judge also orders the plaintiff to provide notice of the court's ruling and file a proof of service of such.

The judge finds that the plaintiff has established a prima facie case for punitive damages, citing voluminous text message evidence that demonstrates Defendant Moghadam and Aesthetic Corp. made fraudulent representations to induce the plaintiff to undergo the medical procedures. The judge also finds that the evidence does not undermine the plaintiff's prima facie case, even though Defendant Moghadam and Aesthetic Corp. presented evidence that they did not commit medical malpractice.

The judge notes that punitive damages are not available for medical negligence and that the plaintiff does not seek punitive damages regarding the medical negligence cause of action. The judge also finds that the proposed amendment will not prejudice the defendant, as the additional expense and inconvenience in defending against the claims is not a significant burden.

Here is the summary in YAML format:

```
Case Number: 22SMCV01527
Plaintiff's Name: John Doe
Defendant's Name: Daniel Moghadam, M.D. and Aesthetic Corp.
People-Names:
  - John Doe

  - Motion for leave to seek punitive damages

Intentions:

  - Plaintiff alleges Defendants committed medical malpractice
  - Plaintiff alleges Defendants committed fraud
Disputes:

  - Whether the Court should grant leave to amend the complaint
  - Whether the proposed amendment will prejudice the Defendant
Acts:
  - Filing a complaint
  - Filing a demurrer
  - Filing a motion for leave to seek punitive damages
  - Filing an opposition to motion
  - Filing a renewed motion
Laws:
  - Code of Civil Procedure section 425.13

  - Civil Code section 3294
Statutes:
  - Code of Civil Procedure section 425.13

  - Civil Code section 3294
Roles:
  - Plaintiff: John Doe
  - Defendant: Daniel Moghadam, M.D. and Aesthetic Corp.
  - Judge: Michael E. Whitaker
Significant Statements:
  - "The Court grants Plaintiff's motion for leave to amend in part. Plaintiff is granted leave to amend the Complaint to assert a claim for punitive damages vis-à-vis the Second Cause of Action for Fraud only."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in plain English:

The judge is considering whether to allow the plaintiff to add a claim for punitive damages to the lawsuit. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants, a doctor and a medical corporation, made false representations about the safety and efficacy of two medical procedures they performed on the plaintiff.

The defendants argue that the plaintiff has not provided enough evidence to support the claim for punitive damages, and that the proposed amendment will cause them undue expense and inconvenience.

The judge has previously allowed the plaintiff to file a motion for leave to seek punitive damages, but the defendants have now objected to the claim.

The judge is considering whether the plaintiff has provided sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case for punitive damages, and whether the proposed amendment will prejudice the defendants.

Ultimately, the judge grants the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the complaint, but only to the extent that it asserts a claim for punitive damages based on the second cause of action for fraud. The plaintiff must file and serve the amended complaint by October 11, 2023.
