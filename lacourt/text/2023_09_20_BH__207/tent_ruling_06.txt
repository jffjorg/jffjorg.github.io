MOTION
 
On January 12, 2023 Plaintiff Brian Whitaker (“Plaintiff”) filed a
verified complaint against Defendant Sam’s Bagels (“Defendant”), bringing
claims under the Unruh Civil Rights Act and the California Disabled Persons
Act, alleging that Sam’s Bagels failed to comply with the accessibility
requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
 
Plaintiff now moves to strike Defendant’s answer to the verified
complaint, on the basis that the answer is unverified.  Defendant has not opposed the motion.
 
ANALYSIS
 

MOTION TO STRIKE

 
Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading, may serve
and file a motion to strike the whole pleading or any part thereof.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (b)(1); Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1322, subd. (b).) 
On a motion to strike, the court may: (1) strike out any irrelevant,
false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike out all or
any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of
California, a court rule, or an order of the court.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subds. (a)-(b); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767,
782.)
 
            Subdivision (b) of Code of Civil
Procedure, section 436 “authorizes the striking of a pleading due to
improprieties in its form or in the procedures pursuant to which it was
filed.”  (Ferraro v. Camarlinghi
(2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 509, 528.)  
 
            Plaintiff filed the verified
complaint on January 12, 2023.  Defendant
was served by substitute service on March 20, 2023.  Defendant demurred and moved to strike the
entire complaint on May 19, 2023.  On
June 30, 2023, the Court overruled Defendant’s demurrer, denied Defendant’s
motion to strike, and ordered Defendant to file an answer to the complaint
within 10 days of the June 30 order. 
(June 30, 2023 Minute Order.)  On
July 19, 2023, Defendant answered the complaint via a general denial, and
asserted affirmative defenses.  The
answer was not verified, and no verification has been subsequently filed.
 
            The Court finds several procedural
defects with the answer.  First,
Defendant was ordered to answer the complaint within 10 days of the June 30,
2023 order, making the answer due on or before July 10, 2023.  But Defendant did not file the answer until
July 19, 2023.  Thus, the answer is
untimely.
 
            Second, a verified complaint may not
be answered by way of a general denial. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 431.30, subd. (d); City of Hollister v. Monterey
Ins. Co. (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 455, 476.)
 
            Third, the answer is unverified, and
Defendant has not subsequently filed a verification.  “Where a complaint is verified, […] the
answer also must be verified.”  (French
v. Smith Booth Usher Co. (1942) 56 Cal.App.2d 23, 29.)  “If an answer is not sufficiently verified in
such a case, it may be stricken out[.]” 
(Ibid.; see also Hearst v. Hart (1900) 128 Cal. 327, 328.)
 
            Thus, the Court finds Defendant’s
answer is procedurally defective.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
The Court grants Plaintiff’s unopposed motion to strike Defendant’s
answer pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure 436 as procedurally defective, and
orders Defendant’s answer stricken in its entirety.  
 
Plaintiff shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service regarding the same.
