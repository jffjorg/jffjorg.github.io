Procedural
Requirements
 
1.     
Timeliness
of Motion 
 
            A notice of motion to compel further
responses must be “given within 45 days of the service of the verified response,
or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific later date
to which” the parties have agreed in writing.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (c),
2031.310, subd. (c), 2033.290, subd. (c).)  Failure to file such a motion within this time
period constitutes a waiver of any right to compel further responses.  (Ibid.)

 
Here, Plaintiff filed the motions on the date set forth above.  Defendant has not objected to the timeliness
of the motions.  
 
2.     
Meet and
Confer
 
            A motion to compel must be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2016.040.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310,
subd. (b)(2).)  A meet and confer
declaration must state facts showing a reasonable and good-faith attempt at an
informal resolution of each issue presented in the motion.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.)  
 
            “The Discovery Act requires that,
prior to the initiation of a motion to compel, the moving party declare that he
or she has made a serious attempt to obtain an informal resolution of each
issue. This rule is designed ‘to encourage the parties to work out their
differences informally so as to avoid the necessity of a formal order.  . . . 
This, in turn, will lessen the burden on the court and reduce the
unnecessary expenditure of resources by litigants through promotion of
informal, extrajudicial resolution of discovery disputes.”  (Townsend
v. Superior Court (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 1431, 1434-1435, citations omitted
[cleaned  up].)  To comply, “A reasonable and good-faith
attempt at informal resolution entails something more than bickering with
[opposing counsel].  Rather, the law
requires that counsel attempt to talk the matter over, compare their views,
consult, and deliberate.”  (Townsend, supra, 61 Cal.App.4th at p.
1439; see also Clement v. Alegre (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 1277, 1294 [to
satisfy the attempt at informal resolution required in section 2016.040
opposing parties must do more than try to persuade each other of their
errors].)  In short, the Discovery Act
“requires that there be a serious effort at negotiation and informal
resolution.”  (Townsend, supra, 61 Cal.App.4th at p. 1438.)
 
            To that end, trial courts are
entrusted with discretion and judgment to determine the necessary effort
required to satisfy the requirement of an informal resolution. (Obregon v.
Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424, 433.)  In determining if parties have satisfied Section
2016.040, judges may consider “the history of the litigation, the nature of the
interaction between counsel, the nature of the issues, the type and scope of
discovery requested, the prospects for success and other similar factors can be
relevant.” (Id. at pp. 431-432 [holding that the trial court was correct
in determining that sending a letter with oppositions was an insufficient
attempt at an informal resolution].)  In
sum, meet and confer efforts should go beyond merely sending letters to each
other stating each party’s respective positions. 
 
            Here, as set forth in the
Declaration of Nicole Herter Perkin and the Supplemental Declaration of Craig
A. Schloss, counsel for Plaintiff, Plaintiff asserts it has engaged in a reasonable
and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of the issues presented in the
motions.  (See Declaration of Nicole
Herter Perkin, ¶¶ 14; Supplemental Declaration of Craig A. Schloss, ¶¶ 3-5,
Exhibit A.) 
 
            Because Defendant has not opposed
the motions, countering the statements of Plaintiff’s counsel, the Court finds
that Plaintiff has met the minimum standards in its attempt to informally
resolve the discovery issues with Defendant before filing the motions as
required by the Discovery Act.       
 
3.     
Separate
Statement 
 
            California Rules of Court, rule
3.1345 requires that any motion involving the content of discovery contain a
separate statement with the text of each request, the response, and a statement
of factual and legal reasons for why an order compelling further responses is
warranted.  
 
            Here, Plaintiff has filed separate
statements related to the motions which complies with Rule 3.1345.
 
Analysis
            
1.     
DISCOVERY – GENERAL PRINCIPLES
 
            “Unless otherwise limited by order
of the court in accordance with this title, any party may obtain discovery
regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter
involved in the pending action or to the determination of any motion made in
that action, if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2017.010.)  
 
            “The purpose of the discovery rules
is to enhance the truth-seeking function of the litigation process and
eliminate trial strategies that focus on gamesmanship and surprise.  In other words, the discovery process is
designed to make a trial less a game of blindman's bluff and more a fair
contest with the basic issues and facts disclosed to the fullest practicable
extent.”  (Juarez v. Boy Scouts of Am., Inc. (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 377, 389
[cleaned up].)   
 
            Where a party objects, or responds
inadequately, to discovery requests, a motion lies to compel further responses,
and that party has the burden to justify the objections or inadequate responses.
(Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255; Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (a) [motion to
compel further responses lies “[o]n receipt of a response to interrogatories”],
2031.310, subd. (a) [motion to compel further responses lies “[o]n receipt of a
response to a demand for inspection”], 2033.290, subd. (a) [motion to compel
further responses lies “[o]n receipt of a response to requests for admissions”].)
 Further, “a trial court's determination
of a motion to compel discovery is reviewed for abuse of discretion.  However, when the facts asserted in support
of and in opposition to the motion are in conflict, the trial court's factual
findings will be upheld if they are supported by substantial evidence.” (Costco Wholesale Corp. v. Superior Court
(2009) 47 Cal.4th 725, 733 [cleaned up].) 
 
            With
respect to interrogatories, the Discovery Act requires as follows:  
            
Each answer in a response to interrogatories
shall be as complete and straightforward as the information reasonably
available to the responding party permits. 
If an interrogatory cannot be answered completely, it shall be answered
to the extent possible.  If the
responding party does not have personal knowledge sufficient to respond fully
to an interrogatory, that party shall so state, but shall make a reasonable and
good faith effort to obtain the information by inquiry to other natural persons
or organizations, except where the information is equally available to the
propounding party.  
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.220, subds.
(a)-(c).)  Similarly, regarding requests
for production of documents or other items, the Discovery Act provides as
follows:
 
The party to whom a demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling has been directed shall respond separately to
each item or category of item by any of the following:  (1) A statement that the party will comply
with the particular demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling by the
date set for the inspection, copying, testing, or sampling pursuant to
paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of Section 2031.030 and any related
activities.  (2) A representation that
the party lacks the ability to comply with the demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling of a particular item or category of item.  (3) An objection to the particular demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling.
 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.210, subd. (a).)  “A
representation of inability to comply with the particular demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling shall affirm that a diligent search
and a reasonable inquiry has been made in an effort to comply with that demand.
This statement shall also specify whether the inability to comply is because
the particular item or category has never existed, has been destroyed, has been
lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has never been, or is no longer, in the
possession, custody, or control of the responding party. The statement shall
set forth the name and address of any natural person or organization known or
believed by that party to have possession, custody, or control of that item or
category of item.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.230; see also Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.220, subds. (a)-(c) [scope of
responses to Requests for Admission].)
 
2.      WAIVER
OF OBJECTIONS – UNTIMELY RESPONSES
 
            “If a party to whom interrogatories
are directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply:   (a) The party to whom the interrogatories
are directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a), emphasis added; see also Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.300, subd. (a), 2033.280, subd. (a).)  
 
            Here, Plaintiff served the SROG,
FROG, RFP and RFA on Defendant on October 13. 2022.  Thus, Defendant’s responses to the discovery
requests were due 30 days after the service of the SROG, FROG, RFP and RFA,
plus additional time based upon the manner of service.  
(See
Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260, subd. (a) [“Within 30 days after service of
interrogatories, the party to whom the interrogatories are propounded shall
serve the original of the response to them on the propounding party”]; see also
Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.260, subd. (a), 2033.250, subd. (a).)  But Defendant did not serve responses to the
subject discovery requests until March 2023 as noted above.  Consequently, Defendant waived objections to
the SROG, FROG, RFP and RFA propounded by Plaintiff.  (See Leach v. Superior Court (1980)
111 Cal.App.3d 902, 906 [“Where no objections have been made within the
statutorily permitted time, they are deemed waived”].)

Sanctions
            
A trial court may sanction a party for engaging in the misuse of
discovery, which includes:  failure to
respond or submit to an authorized method of discovery; making an evasive
response to discovery; making, without substantial justification, an
unmeritorious objection to discovery; and making or opposing, unsuccessfully
and without substantial justification, a motion to compel or to limit
discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.) 
 
            In addition, Code of Civil Procedure
section 2030.300, subdivision (d) provides: “The court shall impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a
further response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(See also Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.310, subd. (h), 2033.290, subd.
(d).)  
            Here,
Plaintiff seeks monetary sanctions in connection with the motions based upon Defendant’s
failure to provide complete, substantive responses to the subject discovery
requests without objections.  The Court
finds Defendant’s failure to provide code compliant responses to be an abuse of
the discovery process, warranting monetary sanctions.  
            Accordingly, the Court will impose monetary sanctions against Defendant
in the amount of $3040.00 which represents eight hours of attorney time to
prepare the moving papers, and attend the hearing, at $350.00 per hour, plus filing
fees of $240.00 at $60.00 per motion.
CONCLUSION AND ORDERS
 
Therefore, the Court grants Plaintiff’s motions to compel further
responses per Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.300, 2031.310 and 2033.290,
and orders Defendant to serve further verified and code compliant responses,
without objections, to the Special Interrogatories, Set 1; Form Interrogatories
(General and Employment), Set 1; Requests for Production of Documents, Set 1;
and Requests for Admission, Set 1, as noted above, within 20 days of notice of
the Court’s orders.
 
Further, the Court orders Defendant
to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $3040.00 to Plaintiff, by and
through counsel for Plaintiff, within 20 days of notice of the Court’s
orders.  
 
Plaintiff shall provide notice
of the Court’s orders and file a proof of service regarding the same.
