And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the motion filed by defendants Escrow L.A. and Sharon L. Sharp for release of funds or imposition of a lien on deposited funds. The defendants seek to add additional attorneys' fees incurred since the summary judgment ruling to the judgment, as well as interest on the judgment. They also seek an order releasing the total amount of the judgment from escrow or, alternatively, a lien on the funds to secure the judgment.

The plaintiff, SEJ, opposes the motion, arguing that the funds should remain on deposit in escrow pending the outcome of the appeal to maintain the status quo. The plaintiff also contends that the defendants have not shown entitlement to any amount over and above the judgment originally entered on June 11, 2024.

The judge grants the motion to the extent defendants seek an updated award of attorneys' fees, but denies the motion to the extent defendants seek an updated award of costs and/or interest. The judge also denies the request to add accrued interest to the judgment.

The judge places a lien on the escrow account pending the outcome of the appeal, and orders that the account shall not be distributed in a manner that precludes enforcement of the lien pending the outcome of the appeal. The parties are reminded that there is an OSC re: Dismissal (Settlement) on calendar concurrently with the hearing on the motion, and are asked to make arrangements to appear remotely at the OSC and hearing on the motion.
