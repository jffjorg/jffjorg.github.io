And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the proposed settlement and apportionment between the plaintiffs and defendants, and is inclined to find the settlement fair and reasonable. The proposed apportionment is also fair and reasonable, taking into account the expenses incurred by the adults. The court will hear from the Petitioner at the upcoming hearing concerning the nature of the relationship with Corylon Jordan, who will receive 1/3 of the adults' settlement proceeds. The court will excuse the appearance of the minor plaintiffs, who are 5 and 8 years old, but requires the Petitioner to appear at the hearing. If the court is satisfied with the Petitioner's testimony, it will grant the petitions and process the orders approving the claims and placing funds in blocked accounts.
