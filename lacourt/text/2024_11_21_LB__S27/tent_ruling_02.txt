 Case Number:  22LBCV00534    Hearing Date:   November 21, 2024    Dept:  S27 Any opposition to the motion was due on or before 11/08/24.  CCP §1005(b). 
Notably, on 8/07/24, the Court advanced the hearing on the motion from 12/05/24
to 11/21/24.  Plaintiff appeared at the
hearing and Defendant did not.  Plaintiff
was ordered to give notice of the ruling, but failed to do so.
 
The Court is concerned about the lack of notice of the continuance and
the lack of opposition.  The hearing on
the motion is therefore continued to 12/05/24, which was the original hearing
date.  The Court asks Counsel to meet and
confer forthwith in an attempt to resolve the issue of the amount of fees to be
recovered in the case.  
 
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice.
