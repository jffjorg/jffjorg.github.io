And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by the Plaintiffs, Evangelina Alfaro Torres and The Estate of Jose Alfaro Torres, to relieve Thomas H. Schelly as their counsel. The motion is unopposed, and the judge has granted it. The Plaintiffs had previously filed proof of service, indicating that they had served all necessary parties with the motion. Because the trial is not scheduled until May 5, 2025, the judge does not expect any prejudice to result from granting the motion. The judge orders the counsel to give notice to the parties and instructs parties who intend to submit on the tentative ruling to email the court to indicate their intention to do so. If the parties do not submit on the tentative, they should arrange to appear remotely at the hearing.
