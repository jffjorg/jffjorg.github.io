And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is a response to four motions filed by On Point Builders, Inc. against Las Palmas Silver, LLC, seeking to compel further responses to discovery requests. The parties held an IDC, where counsel for Las Palmas agreed to serve further responses by March 1, 2024, but failed to do so until nearly four weeks later. The judge finds that this inexcusable delay has caused unnecessary discovery motion practice and increased the costs of the litigation. The judge orders the motions off-calendar and imposes sanctions of $6,037.50 on Las Palmas, reflecting 17.5 hours of attorney time spent preparing the motions and participating in the IDC. The judge also orders Las Palmas to pay the sanctions within 30 days.
