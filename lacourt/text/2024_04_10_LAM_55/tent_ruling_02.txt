 Case Number:  23STCV09253    Hearing Date:   April 10, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:
Motion To Compel Production of Documents Without Objections.
DANIEL POWTER and KDS FARRELL, INC. (“Plaintiffs”) bring
this case against Defendants ANTONIO SALEM and SALEM AND ASSOCIATES, LLP (“Defendants”)
related to Defendants’ alleged mismanagement of Plaintiff Powter’s finances.  
Plaintiff Powter moves to compel Defendant Salem’s initial
responses to a request for documents, set one, and requests $3,637.50 as
sanctions. Defendant Salem did not file an opposition, though his attorney
filed a declaration in opposition to the motion. 
A motion to compel initial discovery responses need
only show that discovery was properly served on the opposing party, the time to
respond expired, and no response was served. Leach v. Sup. Ct. (1980)
111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905-06; Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300 (compelling initial
document requests). A motion to compel initial discovery responses need not
show good cause, meeting and conferring, or timely filing, and need not be
accompanied by a separate statement.  Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pac. Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.
App. 4th 390, 404. Generally, monetary sanctions are mandatory as to parties
losing discovery motions, unless courts find substantial justification or other
injustice. E.g., Foothill Properties v. Lyon/Copley Corona Assocs., L.P.
(1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 1542, 1557-58. “‘[S]ubstantial justification’
has been understood to mean that a justification is clearly reasonable because
it is well-grounded in both law and fact.” Doe v. U.S. Swimming, Inc.
(2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1424, 1434. “If the party seeking a monetary sanction
meets its burden of proof, the burden shifts to the opposing party attempting
to avoid a monetary sanction to show that it acted with ‘substantial
justification.’” Ibid., at p. 1435.
Plaintiff Powter sufficiently showed that Defendant
Salem served no response to the properly served request for production, set one.
Indeed, the declaration from Defendant Salem’s counsel does not dispute that
Defendant Salem has failed to serve verified, written responses to the document
requests and produce responsive documents in Defendant Salem’s possession,
custody, or control. The Court imposes sanctions because Defendant Salem presents
no substantial justification for his repeated, months-long failure to serve
responses to the document requests. 
Thus, the Court grants the motion to compel responses
and the request for sanctions.
On or before 4/24/24, Defendant ANTONIO SALEM shall
serve initial responses, and produce documents, without objections, and in full
compliance with the California Discovery Act (Code Civ. Proc. §2016.010 et
seq.), as to the request for documents, set one, served by Plaintiffs DANIEL
POWTER and KDS FARRELL, INC. By that same date, Defendant Salem shall pay
Plaintiff Powter sanctions in the amount of $3,637.50.
