MOTION:                     Demurrer to the Complaint

LEGAL STANDARD 
 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether
the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be
apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed. (CCP §§ 430.30, 430.70.) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff
need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the
factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28
Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) A “demurrer does not, however, admit contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the pleading, or the
construction of instruments pleaded, or facts impossible in law.” (S. Shore
Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732, internal citations
omitted.) 
 
A special demurrer for uncertainty is
disfavored and will only be sustained where the pleading is so bad that
defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e., cannot reasonably determine what
issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are directed
against him/her. (CCP § 430.10(f); Khoury v. Maly’s of Calif., Inc.
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) Moreover, even if the pleading is somewhat
vague, “ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Ibid.)  
 
“Liberality in permitting amendment is
the rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect has not been given.” (Angie
M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227.) It is an abuse of
discretion for the court to deny leave to amend where there is any reasonable
possibility that plaintiff can state a good cause of action. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) The burden is on plaintiff to show¿in
what manner¿plaintiff can amend the complaint, and¿how¿that
amendment will change the legal effect of the pleading.¿(Id.)

ANALYSIS 
 
Defendants demur to the entirety of the operative First Amended
Complaint (FAC) on res judicata grounds. As set forth below, the court concurs
that the elements of res
judicata are met.   
 
The
doctrine of res judicata generally precludes parties, or their
privies, from relitigating a cause of action determined with finality in a
prior proceeding. (Smith v. ExxonMobil Oil Corp. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th
1407, 1413-14; Wright v. Ripley (1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 1189, 1193.) The
doctrine has two aspects: it applies to both a previously litigated cause of
action, referred to as claim preclusion, and to an issue necessarily decided in
a prior action, referred to as issue preclusion. (Vandenberg v. Superior
Court (1999) 21 Cal.4th 815, 828.) “[R]es judicata does not merely bar
relitigation of identical claims or causes of action. Instead, in its
collateral estoppel aspect, the doctrine may also preclude a party to prior
litigation from redisputing issues therein decided against him, even
when those issues bear on different claims raised in a later case. Moreover,
because the estoppel need not be mutual, it is not necessary that the earlier
and later proceedings involve the identical parties or their privies. Only the
party against whom the doctrine is invoked must be bound by the prior proceeding.
[Citations.]” (Ibid.)¿¿¿
 
“In
California the phrase ‘cause of action’ is often used indiscriminately ... to
mean counts which state [according to different legal theories] the same
cause of action....” (Eichler Homes of San Mateo, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1961) 55 Cal.2d 845, 847.) For purposes of applying the doctrine of res
judicata, the phrase “cause of action” has a more precise meaning: The cause of
action is the right to obtain redress for a harm suffered, regardless of the
specific remedy sought or the legal theory (common law or statutory) advanced.
(Bay Cities Paving & Grading, Inc. v. Lawyers' Mutual Ins. Co.
(1993) 5 Cal.4th 854, 860.) “[T]he ‘cause of action’ is based upon the harm
suffered, as opposed to the particular theory asserted by the litigant.
[Citation.] Even where there are multiple legal theories upon which recovery
might be predicated, one injury gives rise to only one claim for relief. ‘Hence
a judgment for the defendant is a bar to a subsequent action by the plaintiff
based on the same injury to the same right, even though he presents a different
legal ground for relief.’ [Citations.]” Thus, under the primary rights
theory, the determinative factor is the harm suffered. When two actions
involving the same parties seek compensation for the same harm, they generally
involve the same primary right. (Boeken v. Philip Morris USA, Inc.
(2010) 48 Cal.4th 788, 798.)¿ 
 
Both lawsuits arise out of the same general
set of facts, Defendants’ nonjudicial foreclosure efforts on the real property
located at 2568 Military Ave., Los Angeles, 90064. (FAC ¶
27.) Defendants are the mortgage brokers and
servicers. (FAC ¶¶ 5-11.) According to the FAC, Defendants negligently
failed to properly and accurately credit payments made by Plaintiff towards the
subject mortgage and preparing/filing false documents. (FAC ¶¶30-48.) Plaintiff seeks a determination of the amounts owed under
his mortgage agreement pertaining to this property. (FAC ¶¶ 49-59.) Plaintiff
seeks to enforce Defendants’ promise to consider a modification in good faith
after the COVID forbearance period. (FAC ¶¶ 60-67.) Ultimately, Plaintiff seeks
to quiet title on the subject property. (¶ 84.) In
the prior 2022 action, Plaintiff alleged that Defendants made the same promise
for a good-faith modification review but failed to fulfill its promise. Plaintiff's
current FAC is premised on nearly identical allegations. At the core, Plaintiff’s
causes of action asserted in the instant lawsuit rely on the same claim that he
was somehow deprived of an opportunity to modify his mortgage. Thus, the
actions involve the same primary rights and parties.
 
Plaintiff's prior claims were adjudicated
on the merits, resulting in a final judgment. (RJN, Ex. D.) Thus, Plaintiff is
attempting to relitigate a claim that was already decided on the merits.  Accordingly, Defendants’ demurrer is SUSTAINED without leave to amend.
