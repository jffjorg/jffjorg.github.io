And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the motion to lift the discovery stay filed by Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants Jinwan Shen and Da Bai Niu. The motion was filed in response to Defendant Ziyi Yang's Special Motion to Strike Plaintiffs' Complaint. The Judge found that Plaintiffs have not demonstrated good cause for lifting the discovery stay and that their requests for discovery are not necessary to oppose the motion. Specifically, the Judge noted that Plaintiffs have not explained how the requested discovery would specifically support their fraudulent transfer claims and that the requests are broad and generic. The Judge also granted Plaintiffs' request for judicial notice.
