And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Plaintiff, Stanley Wilson, has moved to amend the judgment entered on February 15, 2024, which requires the parties to list the subject property for sale with Jay Dharmasuriya of Realty Brokerage Group Inc. as the broker. The Plaintiff requests that the court instead nominate Gerry Nicks of Keller Williams Realty as the broker, citing the Defendants' failure to comply with the judgment. However, the Court finds that the Plaintiff's request exceeds the Court's authority and is procedurally improper. The Court has the authority to control litigation and ensure the orderly administration of justice, but this does not grant it the power to substantively amend the judgment. The Plaintiff should seek to enforce the existing judgment using procedurally proper methods. Therefore, the motion is denied.
