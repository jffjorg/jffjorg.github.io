English-text summary:

The Judge granted the motion of Hesam Yazdanpanah, an attorney representing Joe Castellanos and Fernando Sandoval, to be relieved as counsel. The judge found that an irreparable breakdown of the attorney-client relationship had occurred, as the clients refused to communicate and the attorney was unable to confirm their current address after making reasonable efforts. The judge ruled that the clients would not be prejudiced by the withdrawal, given that the trial date is not until July 2025. The order is effective upon proof of service of the order to the client, and a status conference is set for January 28, 2025, to discuss retention of counsel.
