And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint, which alleges that the defendants made promises for a good-faith modification review but failed to fulfill them. The defendants argue that the doctrine of res judicata applies, as the plaintiff's prior claims were adjudicated on the merits in a prior action. The judge agrees, finding that the plaintiff is attempting to relitigate a claim that was already decided on the merits. The judge sustains the demurrer without leave to amend.
