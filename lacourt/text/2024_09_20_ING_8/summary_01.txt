And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion of Timothy M. Ghobrial, Esq. and Downtown LA Law Group to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff Edwin Castanon. The motion was filed on July 8, 2024, and was properly served on the plaintiff via mail. The court finds that the withdrawal of Ghobrial and his firm as counsel for Castanon will not cause an injustice or undue delay in the proceedings. The court notes that a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship has arisen, which appears to be irreconcilable. The court orders that the motion be granted and that the signed order be served on the client and all parties who have appeared in the case.
