English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Anna Mezheritsky v. Dorothy Kovich Klein, et al. The case involves a dispute over a settlement agreement and the distribution of $200,000 in settlement funds. The judge has denied Redd's motion for order of interpleader authorizing deposit of the funds with the court, finding that Redd is a claimant rather than a stakeholder and has not identified any precedent for a claimant seeking an interpleader of funds that the moving party does not hold. The judge has also overruled Redd's demurrer on procedural grounds without prejudice, finding that Redd's meet and confer efforts were insufficient. The judge has continued the motion to strike portions of the complaint-in-intervention, finding that it is intertwined with the demurrer. The judge will hear oral argument on the motion for order of interpleader authorizing deposit of the funds with the court and will consider further arguments on the issue.
