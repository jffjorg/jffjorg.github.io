And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Toyota's motion for a protective order to limit the number of special interrogatories propounded by Plaintiffs. The judge finds that the Plaintiffs' declaration for additional discovery is insufficient to justify propounding more than 35 special interrogatories. The judge grants Toyota's motion without prejudice to subsequent discovery requests and suggests that Plaintiffs' counsel provide a more sufficient declaration in the future. The judge also denies both cross-requests for monetary sanctions.
