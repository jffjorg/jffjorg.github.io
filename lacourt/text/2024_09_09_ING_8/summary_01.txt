The judge has made tentative rulings on 25 motions in limine filed by the parties. The motions sought to exclude or limit certain evidence from being presented at trial. The judge granted some of the motions, denied others, and made partial grants or denials of others.

The judge excluded certain evidence, including:

* Cal-OSHA analysis and expert testimony
* Photographs and videos showing the decedent's death
* Testimony about the defendant's financial condition
* Evidence of the defendant's wealth

The judge allowed certain evidence, including:

* Expert testimony about the design of the petroleum storage facility
* Testimony about the relationship between the defendant and the decedent
* Evidence of the defendant's industry custom and usage

The judge also made some significant statements, including:

* The court will not permit the display to the jury of any video or still photo that shows the minor plaintiff kissing a headstone or kissing a photograph of his late father.
* Argument is not evidence and the CACI on non-economic damages instructs jurors as noted in the Court's tentative as to MIL D-11.
* The court will allow witnesses from both sides to testify as to the design roles of the participants in the subject product, and allow Plaintiffs to offer evidence bearing on the role Plaintiffs contend that Matrix occupied with respect to the products at issue.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling aims to streamline the trial and prevent the introduction of unnecessary evidence, while also allowing the parties to present relevant and important evidence to the jury.
