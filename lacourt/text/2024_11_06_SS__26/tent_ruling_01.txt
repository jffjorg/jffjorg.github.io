Discussion
 
Allegations in the Complaint
 
Plaintiffs allege they entered
into a residential lease agreement with Defendant to rent the premises at 1801
Cielito Drive, Glendale, California (“the Premises”) starting on June 1, 2021,
for one year. (Compl., ¶8 and Exh. A.) The lease would terminate on June 1,
2022 unless Defendant continued to accept rent, which would create a
month-to-month tenancy. (Id. at ¶10.) Either party could terminate the
month-to-month tenancy with a 60-day written notice of termination. (Ibid.)
Plaintiffs paid Defendant a $6,000.00 security deposit pursuant to the lease agreement.
(Id. at ¶11.) Plaintiffs remained at the Premises after June 1, 2022
pursuant to a month-to-month tenancy. (Id. at ¶14.) On April 14, 2023,
Plaintiffs sent Defendant a written request for a shorter termination period
than the 60 days provided for in the lease. (Id. at ¶15 and Exh. B.) On
May 7, 2023, Plaintiffs texted Defendant that they could vacate the Premises on
May 16, 2023, to which Defendant agreed. (Id. at ¶18.) On May 17, 2023,
Defendant picked up the keys to the Premises. (Id. at ¶20.) On June 7,
2023, Plaintiffs asked Defendant about the security deposit to which he
responded that he was unable to secure a new tenant so they were responsible
for rent until June 14, 2023. (Id. at ¶21.) On June 18, 2023, Defendant
sent Plaintiffs an email stating he was deducting $2,613.00 in rent for May 16,
2023 to June 14, 2023, $750.00 for damage to shelves in the pantry room and
office, and $700.00 to clean the living room floor. (Id. at ¶22 and Exh.
C.) 
 
Request for Judicial Notice
 
Plaintiffs ask that the Court
take judicial notice of the pleadings in this action and the Court’s ruling on
the Motion for Summary Judgment. The request is granted pursuant to Evidence
Code section 452, subdivision (d) with respect to the filing of those
documents, but not as to the truth of their contents. (See Adams v. Bank of
America, N.A. (2020) 51 Cal.App.5th 666, 673 [citing Sosinsky v. Grant
(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1548, 1569–1570].)
 
Legal Standard
 
Plaintiffs move for summary adjudication as to each cause of
action on the Complaint pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 437c. On a motion
for summary judgment or adjudication of a particular cause of action, a moving plaintiff
must show that there is no defense by proving each element of the cause of
action entitling the party to judgment on that cause of action. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) Then the burden shifts to the defendant to show
that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of
action or a defense. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) Additionally, in
ruling on the Motion, the Court must view the “evidence [citations] and such
inferences [citations], in the light most favorable to the opposing party.” (Intrieri
v. Superior Court (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 72, 81 [citing Aguilar v.
Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843].) 
 
1st Cause of Action for Breach
of Contract; 4th Cause of Action for Attorney’s Fees
 
As to the first cause of action
for breach of contract, the Motion does not seek adjudication of the entire
cause of action. Instead, Plaintiffs ask that the Court adjudicate that there
are no triable issues of material fact as to the first, third, and fourth elements
of the breach of contract claim. (Notice of Motion, p. 2:9-17.) This is not permissible
under the moving statute. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (f)(1) [“A motion for
summary adjudication shall be granted only if it completely disposes of a cause
of action, an affirmative defense, a claim for damages, or an issue of duty.”] As
noted above, Plaintiffs’ burden is to prove each element of the cause of action.
Therefore, Plaintiffs’ request for summary adjudication with respect to certain
elements of the first cause of action is denied.
 
Plaintiff’s fourth cause of
action for attorney’s fees is based on paragraph 31 of the lease agreement,
which entitles a prevailing party on an action to enforce the lease agreement
to an award of attorney’s fees. (Motion, Separate Statement, Faliero Decl.,
Exh. A at ¶31.) As Plaintiffs have not shown they are the prevailing party on
the breach of contract cause of action, they have not shown they are entitled
to attorney’s fees under this provision. Plaintiffs’ request for summary
adjudication of the fourth cause of action is also denied.
 
2nd and 3rd Causes of Action
for Violation of Civil Code section 1950.5
 
Plaintiffs move for summary
adjudication with respect to the different subdivisions of Civil Code section
1950.5, at issue, specifically subdivisions (b), (e), (f), (g), and (l). 
 
Civil Code section 1950.5,
subdivision (f)(1) states in relevant part:
 
Within a reasonable time after
notification of either party’s intention to terminate the tenancy, or before
the end of the lease term, the landlord shall notify the tenant in writing of
the tenant's option to request an initial inspection and of the tenant's right
to be present at the inspection. . . . At a reasonable time, but no earlier
than two weeks before the termination or the end of lease date, the landlord,
or an agent of the landlord, shall, upon the request of the tenant, make an
initial inspection of the premises prior to any final inspection the landlord
makes after the tenant has vacated the premises.
 
(Civ. Code, § 1950.5, subd.
(f)(1).) Plaintiffs contend Defendant violated this provision as follows.
Starting on April 14, 2023, Plaintiffs informed Defendant of their intent to
move out and began communicating regarding the exact move out date. (Motion,
Separate Statement, Fact Nos. 6-10; Faliero Decl., ¶¶6-10 and Exhs. B-C.)
Defendant did not schedule or conduct a move out inspection by May 17, 2023,
the date Plaintiffs moved out. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 11;
Faliero Decl., ¶11.) 
 
Cal. Civ. Code § 1950.5(f)(2)
states: 
 
Based on the inspection, the
landlord shall give the tenant an itemized statement specifying repairs or
cleanings that are proposed to be the basis of any deductions from the security
the landlord intends to make pursuant to paragraphs (1) to (4), inclusive, of
subdivision (b). This statement shall also include the texts of paragraphs (1)
to (4), inclusive, of subdivision (b). The statement shall be given to the
tenant, if the tenant is present for the inspection, or shall be left inside
the premises.
 
(Civ. Code, § 1950.5, subd.
(f)(2).) It is not clear what facts support Defendant’s violation of this
provision of the statute as none are cited in Plaintiffs’ Motion. (Motion, p.
7:26-8:16.) 
 
Civil Code section 1950.5,
subdivision (f)(3) states: “The tenant shall have the opportunity during the
period following the initial inspection until termination of the tenancy to
remedy identified deficiencies, in a manner consistent with the rights and
obligations of the parties under the rental agreement, in order to avoid
deductions from the security.” (Civ. Code, § 1950.5, subd. (f)(3).) As noted
above, Defendant did not conduct an initial inspection or provide any initial
itemized list of potential deductions. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No.
11; Faliero Decl., ¶11.) 
 
Civil Code section 1950.5,
subdivision (g)(1) states: 
 
No later than 21 calendar days
after the tenant has vacated the premises, but not earlier than the time that
either the landlord or the tenant provides a notice to terminate the tenancy
under Section 1946 or 1946.1, Section 1161 of the Code of Civil Procedure, or
not earlier than 60 calendar days prior to the expiration of a fixed-term
lease, the landlord shall furnish the tenant, by personal delivery or by
first-class mail, postage prepaid, a copy of an itemized statement indicating
the basis for, and the amount of, any security received and the disposition of
the security, and shall return any remaining portion of the security to the
tenant.
 
(Civ. Code, § 1950.5, subd.
(g)(1).) Plaintiffs moved out on May 16, 2023 and returned the keys on May 17,
2023. [Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 11; Faliero Decl., ¶¶11.) Defendant
emailed Plaintiffs a letter on June 18, 2023 explaining the amounts that had
been deducted. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact Nos. 13, 18; Faliero Decl.,
¶¶13, 18; Exh. D.) June 18, 2023 was 33 days after May 17, 2023. The June 18,
2023 letter was also not sent by personal delivery or first class mail as
required by the statute. 
 
Civil Code section 1950.5,
subdivision (g)(2) states: “Along with the itemized statement, the landlord
shall also include copies of documents showing charges incurred and deducted by
the landlord to repair or clean the premises.” (Civ. Code, § 1950.5, subd.
(g)(2).) The June 18, 2023 letter did not include the itemizations or
documentation required. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 13; Faliero
Decl., ¶13 and Exh. D.) Defendant also purportedly sent a letter on July 3,
2024, which was likewise deficient in its documentation. (Motion, Separate
Statement, Fact No. 15; Faliero Decl., ¶15 and Exh. E.) 
 
Plaintiffs next contend that
Defendant violated Civil Code section 1950.5 subdivisions (b) and (e) by
deducting for ordinary wear and tear from the security deposit. (Motion,
Separate Statement, Fact Nos. 13, 15; Faliero Decl., ¶¶13, 15 and Exhs. D and
E.)  Specifically, Plaintiffs argue that
the amounts deducted for cleaning a parquet floor in the living room, repairing
a toilet seat, and a jacuzzi tub faucet amount to “ordinary wear and tear.” No
authority, however, is provided for what constitutes “ordinary wear and tear”
and why these items fall within that definition. Defendant’s letter dated June
18, 2023 describe the floor as being in “horrible condition” and the letter
dated July 3, 2023 described the wear and tear as “excessive.” 
 
Finally, Plaintiffs argue this
evidence demonstrates that Defendant retained their security deposit in bad
faith, in violation of Civil Code section 1950.5, subdivision (l). Defendant
has the burden of demonstrating the reasonableness of the amounts deducted and
their failure to do so as detailed above amounts to bad faith. (See Code Civ.
Proc., § 1950.5, subd. (l).) 
 
Based on the foregoing,
Plaintiffs have carried their initial burden of proof to demonstrate that
Defendant violated subdivisions (f)(1), (f)(3), (g)(1), (g)(2), and (l) of
Civil Code sections 1950.5. The burden now shifts to Defendant to demonstrate
the existence of a triable issue of material fact regarding the violation of
these subdivisions.
 
Defendant’s Burden to
Demonstrate a Triable Issue of Material Fact
 
Defendant disputes that they
agreed to allow Plaintiffs to vacate the Premises on May 16, 2023. (Opp.,
Separate Statement, Fact No. 9; Karakhanian Decl., ¶¶23, 34 and Exh. B.) Their
evidence in support of this is the text message conversation between the
parties starting on April 14, 2023. In the conversation, Plaintiffs state, “We
will be out 5/16 Tuesday” and Defendant responds, “I got it, I’ll fly there on
16th to be there on 17th.” (Oppo., Karakhanian Decl., Exh. B, p. 29.) To the
extent Defendant argues that Plaintiffs were still contractually obligated to
pay rent until June 14, 2023, the opposition does not explain how this changes
Defendant’s obligations under Civil Code section 1950.5, which pertain to the
move out date. 
 
Defendant also disputes that they
did not provide an itemized list of deductions but does not explain how the
June 18, 2023 letter or July 3, 2024 letter complied with the statutory
requirements of Civil Code section 1950.5, subdivision (g). (Opp., Separate
Statement, Fact No. 11.) It is not enough that the letters include “copies of
documents showing charges incurred and deducted by the landlord to repair or
clean the premises.” (Opp., pp. 14:26-15:2.) That documentation must be in a
specified format and Plaintiffs have shown that it was not as discussed above.
Defendant does not provide evidence to the contrary. No has Defendant shown
that the letters were timely under the statute’s 21-day deadline following
Plaintiffs’ move out date.
 
Finally, Defendant disputes that
they did not conduct a move out inspection by pointing out that they came to
the Premises on May 17, 2023. (Opp., Separate Statement, Fact No. 15; Karakhanian
Decl., Exh. B, pp. 29-30.) Although the text conversations indicate that
Defendant flew out on May 17, 2023 and was at the Premises on that date,
nothing shows an understanding between the parties that an inspection would be
held on that date. Defendant’s declaration contends that the inspection was
arranged by the parties on the phone for the same date, this does not show that
the inspection was ever conducted. (Opp., Separate Statement, Additional Fact
No. 29; Karakhanian Decl., ¶18.) Even if Plaintiffs failed to show up on May
17, 2024, Defendant does not explain why the inspection did not proceed without
them. Under Civil Code section 1950.5, subdivision (f)(1), “[t]he landlord
shall proceed with the inspection whether the tenant is present or not . . . .”
(Civ. Code, § 1950.5, subd. (f)(1).) 
 
Defendant’s evidence, therefore,
does not create a triable issue of material fact regarding their violation of
subdivisions (f)(1), (f)(3), (g)(1), (g)(2), and (l) of Civil Code sections
1950.5. Plaintiffs’ request for summary adjudication of the second and third
causes of action is granted.
 
Conclusion

Kenneth C. Faliero and Megan A. Faliero’s Motion for Summary Adjudication is

SECOND AND THIRD CAUSES OF ACTION.
