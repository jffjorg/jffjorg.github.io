And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the Motion to Amend Judgment filed by Medline Industries, LP (the Judgment Creditor) against Gente Health Partners, LLC (the Judgment Debtor). The Judgment Creditor seeks to amend the judgment to include the Judgment Debtor's corporate form, which was not included in the initial judgment obtained in Chicago, Illinois. The judge finds that the Code of Civil Procedure section 187 authorizes the amendment of a judgment to add additional judgment debtors, including an alter ego or successor corporation. The judge also notes that the omission of the corporate form may prevent sheriffs in California from conducting post-judgment remedies, making it necessary to amend the judgment to add the corporate form. Therefore, the judge grants the Motion to Amend Judgment.
