And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary adjudication filed by Plaintiffs Kenneth C. Faliero and Megan A. Faliero. The Plaintiffs are seeking summary adjudication as to each cause of action in their complaint against Defendant Armen Karakhanian.

The judge has denied the Plaintiffs' motion as to the first cause of action (breach of contract) and the fourth cause of action (attorney's fees). However, the judge has granted the Plaintiffs' motion as to the second and third causes of action (violations of Civil Code section 1950.5).

The judge found that the Plaintiffs had failed to show that Defendant had breached the contract or that Defendant had acted in bad faith in retaining the security deposit. However, the judge did find that Defendant had violated Civil Code section 1950.5 by failing to conduct an initial inspection, provide an itemized list of deductions, and return the security deposit in a timely manner.

The judge has given the parties notice of the tentative ruling and invited them to file written arguments in support of or opposition to the ruling.
