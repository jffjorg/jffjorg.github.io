And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, or in the alternative, summary adjudication, in the case of Gonzalez v. Chang. The plaintiff, Barbara Gonzalez, had filed a lawsuit against the defendant, Ben Chang, alleging breach of contract and violation of Civil Code section 1950.5. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant had failed to comply with the terms of their written residential lease agreement and had refused to return a security deposit of $6,000.00. The judge found that the plaintiff had demonstrated the existence of a contract, her performance of the contract, the defendant's breach, and resulting damages. The judge also found that the defendant had violated the statutory requirements of Civil Code section 1950.5. As no opposition had been filed, the judge concluded that there were no triable issues of material fact and granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff is required to file and serve a proposed judgment within 20 days of this ruling.
