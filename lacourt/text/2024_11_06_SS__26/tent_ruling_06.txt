Discussion
 
Allegations in the Complaint
 
The Complaint alleges causes of action for (1) breach of contract; and
(2) violation of Civil Code § 1950.5, based on the following facts. Defendant
is the owner of the real property located at 2620 Deodar Circle, Pasadena,
California (“the Property”). (Compl., ¶2.) On August 11, 2014, Plaintiff and
Richard Mitchell entered into a written residential lease with Defendant for
the Property. (Compl., ¶4.) In accordance with the lease agreement, in August
2014, Plaintiff paid Defendant a security deposit in the amount of $6,000.00. (Id.
at ¶5.) On December 28, 2023, Defendant gave Plaintiff a written 60 Day Notice
to Quit the Property. (Id. at ¶6 and Exh. B.) Plaintiff vacated the
Property and held a final walk-through with Defendant on February 11, 2024. (Id.
at ¶7.) Defendant failed to comply with the 21-day deadline set forth in Civil
Code section 1950.5 and (b) Section 4(b) of the Lease to withhold any amounts
from the Security Deposit. (Id. at ¶7.) Defendant also failed to provide
any receipts and itemizations for any and all deductions exceeding $125.00 from
the Security Deposit; and failed to return any amounts from Plaintiff’s
Security Deposit. (Ibid.) On March 26, 2024, Plaintiff made written
demand upon Defendant to return the security deposit, but Defendant refused to
respond. (Id. at ¶8.) As a result of Defendant’s breach of the lease
agreement and violation of Civil Code section 1950.5, Plaintiff is entitled to
actual damages of $6,000.00 and statutory damages of $12,000.00. (Id. at
¶¶11, 17-18.) 
 
Motion for Summary Judgment / Adjudication
 
On a motion for summary judgment, a moving plaintiff must
show that there is no defense by proving each element of every cause of action
entitling the party to judgment on that cause of action. (Code Civ. Proc., §
437c, subd. (p)(1).) Then the burden shifts to the defendant to show that a
triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the causes of action
or a defense. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) Additionally, in ruling
on the Motion, the Court must view the “evidence [citations] and such
inferences [citations], in the light most favorable to the opposing party.” (Intrieri
v. Superior Court (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 72, 81 [citing Aguilar v.
Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843].)
 
Plaintiff’s Initial Burden of Proof
 
Plaintiff contends she is
entitled to judgment under the terms of the parties’ lease agreement and the
language of Civil Code section 1950.5,
subdivision (l). An action for breach of contract must demonstrate (1) the
existence of a contract; (2) plaintiff’s performance of the contract or excuse
for nonperformance; defendant's breach; and (4) resulting damage. (Harris v.
Rudin, Richman & Appel (1997) 74 Cal.App.4th 299, 307). Civil Code section 1950.5 provides in
relevant part:
 
No later than 21 calendar days after the tenant has vacated the premises,
but not earlier than the time that either the landlord or the tenant provides a
notice to terminate the tenancy under Section 1946 or 1946.1, Section 1161 of
the Code of Civil Procedure, or not earlier than 60 calendar days prior to the
expiration of a fixed-term lease, the landlord shall furnish the tenant, by
personal delivery or by first-class mail, postage prepaid, a copy of an
itemized statement indicating the basis for, and the amount of, any security
received and the disposition of the security, and shall return any remaining
portion of the security to the tenant. …”
 
(Civ. Code, § 1950.5, subd. (g)(1).) Bad faith retention of the security
deposit in violation of this statute entitles the tenant to “statutory damages
of up to twice the amount of the security, in addition to actual damages.”
(Civ. Code, § 1950.5, subd. (l).) 
 
Plaintiff relies on the following
undisputed facts with respect to both causes of action. On August 11, 2014,
Plaintiff entered into a written residential lease with Defendant for the
Property. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 1; Gonzalez Decl., ¶2 and Exh.
A.) Under sections 4(a) and 5 of the lease agreement, on August 28, 2014,
Plaintiff paid Defendant a security deposit in the amount of $6,000.00.
(Motion, Separate Statement, Fact Nos. 2-3; Gonzalez Decl., ¶¶3-4 and Exhs. A,
C.) On December 28, 2023, Defendant gave Plaintiff a handwritten 60-Day Notice
to Quit the Property. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 4; Gonzalez Decl.,
¶5 and Exh. B.) Plaintiff vacated the Property on February 11, 2024. (Motion,
Separate Statement, Fact No. 5; Gonzalez Decl., ¶6.) The parties held a
walk-through of the Property after Plaintiff vacated. (Motion, Separate
Statement, Fact No. 6; Gonzalez Decl., ¶6.) Defendant did not comply with the
21-day deadline under section 4(b) of the lease to provide an itemized statement
of deductions and any documentation for any and all deductions exceeding $125.00
from the security deposit. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 7; Gonzalez
Decl., ¶6.) Plaintiff demanded Defendant return the deposit multiple times, but
he has refused to do so. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact Nos. 8-9; Gonzalez
Decl., ¶¶7-8; Furutani Decl., ¶2 and Exh. D.) 
 
This evidence carries Plaintiff
initial burden of proof with respect to the breach of contract cause of action.
Plaintiff demonstrates the existence of the lease agreement, Plaintiff’s
compliance with its terms, Defendant’s breach, and resulting damages. Likewise,
Plaintiff has shown that Defendant violated the statutory requirements of Civil
Code section 1950.5. The burden now
shifts to Defendant to demonstrate the existence of triable issues of material
fact regarding breach of the lease agreement and violation of Civil Code
section 1950.5. As no opposition has been filed to date, however, no such
triable issues of material fact are shown to exist.
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiff Barbara Gonzalez’s Motion for Summary Judgment, or in the
alternative, Summary adjudication, is GRANTED. PLAINTIFF IS TO FILE AND SERVE A
PROPOSED JUDGMENT WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS RULING.
