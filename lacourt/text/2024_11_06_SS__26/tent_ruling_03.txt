Department of Industrial Relations v. Hayrapetian,
et al.MOTION TO VACATE JUDGMENT
(CCP § 473(d))
 

TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Respondent Vache Hayrapetian dba Vahe Hayrapetian’s Motion
to Vacate Judgment is DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
On June 14, 2024, the Court entered judgment in favor of Department
of Industrial Relations (“Petitioner”) and against Vache Hayrapetian dba Vahe
Hayrapetian (“Respondent”) pursuant to an Order, Decision or Award of the Labor
Commissioner. Respondent filed the instant Motion to Vacate Judgment on October
14, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date.
 
 
Discussion
 
Respondent moves to vacate the judgment on grounds that it is void, pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (d), which states that “[t]he court
may, .... on motion of either party after notice to the other party, set aside
any void judgment or order.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (d).) The Motion,
however, does not explain why the judgment is void or define a void judgment
under the law. Respondent’s supporting declaration contends that no proof of
service of summons was filed in this action, but offers no authority for the
issuance of a summons with respect to entry of a judgment on a Final Citation and
Notification of Penalty of The Division of Occupational Safety And Health.
(Motion, Hayrapetian Decl., ¶1.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, Respondent Vache Hayrapetian dba Vahe Hayrapetian’s
Motion to Vacate Judgment is DENIED.
 
 
Court clerk to give notice of this order.
