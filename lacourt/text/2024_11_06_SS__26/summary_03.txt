And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Department of Industrial Relations (Petitioner) obtained a judgment against Vache Hayrapetian dba Vahe Hayrapetian (Respondent) on June 14, 2024. Respondent filed a Motion to Vacate Judgment on October 14, 2024, claiming the judgment is void, but failed to provide any authority or explanation for why the judgment is void. The Motion also relies on a declaration that no proof of service of summons was filed, but this is irrelevant because the judgment was entered on a Final Citation and Notification of Penalty from the Division of Occupational Safety And Health. The court finds that Respondent's Motion is lacking in substance and therefore DENIES the Motion to Vacate Judgment.
