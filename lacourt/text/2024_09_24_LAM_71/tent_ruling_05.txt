Judgment Creditors 8451 Melrose Property, LLC’s,
and Jack Simantob’s motion for attorneys’ fees and costs is continued to a date
after the final resolution of the non-dischargeability action in In re
Ramesh Akhtarzad and Sina Akhtarzad, U.S. Bankruptcy Court C.D. Cal. Case
No. 2:11-BK-61640.
Judgment Creditor 8451 Melrose Property,
LLC’s motion to determine the Undertaking on Appeal filed in this action is insufficient is granted. A sufficient
new, additional, or supplemental undertaking must be filed within 5 days of
this ruling.
 
Judgment
Creditors 8451 Melrose Property, LLC (“8451 Melrose”) and Jack Simantob
(“Simantob”) (collectively, “Judgment Creditors”) move for an award of
attorneys’ fees incurred during the period from July 1, 2022, through May 31,
2024, in enforcing the judgment rendered in this action, in the amount of
$459,391.25, and costs incurred during the same period in the amount of
$16,299.21.  (Notice of Motion Fees, pgs.
1-2; C.C.P. §§685.040, 685.080, 1033.5(a)(10)(A).) 
Judgment
Creditor 8451 Melrose moves to determine the Undertaking on Appeal filed in
this action (1) is insufficient, and (2) to direct that a sufficient new,
additional, or supplemental undertaking be filed within 5 days.  (Notice Motion Undertaking, pgs. 1-2; C.C.P.
§§995.920(b), 995.930, 996.010.)  8451
Melrose moves on the grounds that the amount of the Undertaking is facially
insufficient, in that it is far less than one and one-half times the amount of
the judgment as originally entered, and that the amount of post-judgment
interest, attorneys’ fees, and costs that have already accrued require that the
amount of the bond be increased to an amount no less than $22 million.  (Notice Motion Undertaking, pg. 2.)
 
Background
On
June 14, 2018, this Court rendered a judgment in favor of Judgment Creditors
and against Judgment Debtor Sina Akhtarzad (“Sina”) in this breach of
commercial lease case.  The judgment
included an award of damages in the amount of $10,555,837, prejudgment interest
in the amount of $523,453.83, and attorneys’ fees totaling over $1.2 million.  The judgment recites that the award of
attorneys’ fees was made pursuant to C.C.P. §1717 and §29.21 of the lease in
issue in the action. The total amount of the judgment as of the date of entry
was $12,428,584.85.
During
the course of the litigation, Sina filed a voluntary bankruptcy petition. The parties
stipulated to relief from the bankruptcy stay to allow the amount of
Akhtarzad’s liability to be determined. A fraction of the judgment was paid out
of a reserve established for that purpose by the Bankruptcy Court. The judgment
is otherwise unsatisfied.
Sina unsuccessfully
appealed from the judgment.  The Court of
Appeal affirmed the judgment without qualification and directed that 8451
Melrose was to recover its costs on appeal.  The remittitur issued on September 10, 2020.
On
October 20, 2020, Judgment Creditors filed a motion for attorneys’ fees
incurred on appeal.  Fees incurred with
Judgment Creditors’ litigation counsel, Freedman Taitelman + Cooley, LLP (then
known as Freedman + Taitelman, LLP), through September 30, 2020, were included
in the amount sought by that motion. Pursuant to a stipulation of the parties,
the Court awarded an additional $261,960.80 in attorneys’ fees and an
additional $8,937.03 in costs.
On
July 28, 2022, Judgment Creditors filed a motion for an award of the attorneys’
fees incurred in enforcing the judgment.  That motion only sought recovery of fees
incurred from July 29, 2020, through June 30, 2022.  This Court granted the motion, awarding
$348,737.65.
Efforts
to enforce the judgment continued after June 30, 2022.  In this Court, Judgment Creditors filed
successful motions to amend the judgment to add further judgment creditors and
for attorneys’ fees. 
 
1.     Attorneys’
Fees Motion
Procedural History
Judgment Creditors filed the instant motion
for attorneys’ fees on July 1, 2024. 
Judgment Debtors filed their opposition to the fee motion on September
11, 2024.  Judgment Creditors filed their
reply on September 17, 2024.
 
Legal Standard
C.C.P. §685.040 provides:
The judgment creditor is entitled to the reasonable and necessary costs
of enforcing a judgment. Attorney’s fees incurred in enforcing a judgment are
not included in costs collectible under this title unless otherwise provided by
law. Attorney’s fees incurred in enforcing a judgment are included as costs
collectible under this title if the underlying judgment includes an award of
attorney’s fees to the judgment creditor pursuant to subparagraph (A) of
paragraph (10) of subdivision (a) of Section 1033.5.
 
(C.C.P. §685.040.)
C.C.P. §1033.5(a)(10)(A), provides for the
recovery of contractually authorized attorneys’ fees as an element of costs.  (See C.C.P. §1033.5(a)(10)(A).) Thus, when
the underlying judgment provides for recovery of attorneys’ fees pursuant to a
contract, the judgment creditor is entitled to recover attorneys’ fees incurred
in enforcing that judgment.
 
Discussion
Here, the judgment specifically provides
for recovery of attorneys’ fees pursuant to §29.21 of the lease that was the
subject of the litigation. (6/14/18 Judgment, pgs. 2, 3.)  Accordingly, Judgment Creditors are entitled
to recover attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in enforcing the judgment.
Attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in
enforcing a judgment may be claimed by a noticed motion.  (C.C.P. §685.080(a); Lucky United Properties
Investment, Inc. v. Lee (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 125, 141.)  Such a motion must be made before the judgment
is satisfied in full, but not later than two years after the attorneys’ fees
and costs were incurred.  (C.C.P.
§685.080(a).) 
Here, the judgment has not been fully
satisfied. The fees and costs sought by this motion are those incurred in
connection with the enforcement of the judgment between July 1, 2022, and May
31, 2024, within the two-year window specified by §685.080.  Therefore, the fees sought are timely in the statutorily
specified manner.
 
Reasonable
Fees
To calculate
a lodestar amount, the Court must first determine the reasonableness of the
hourly rates sought by the Judgment Creditors’ counsel. The Supreme Court of
California has concluded that a reasonable hourly lodestar rate is the
prevailing rate for private attorneys “conducting non-contingent litigation of
the same type.”  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001)
24 Cal.4th 1122, 1133, emphasis added.)
Judgment
Creditors’ Counsel declares the following hourly rates: (1) Lewis R. Landau at
$645.00 per hour in 2022, $695.00 per hour in 2023, and $745.00 per hour in
2024; (2) Michael Taitelman at $550.00 per hour for in 2022, $595.00 per hour
in 2023, and $650.00 per hour in 2024; and (3) Steven E. Formaker at $450.00
per hour in 2022, $495.00 per hour in 2023, and $550.00 per hour in 2024.  (Decl. of Landau ¶¶9-10, Exh. A; Decl. of
Taitelman ¶¶9-10, Exh. B.)  
Judgment
Creditors have sufficiently demonstrated their counsel’s hourly rates are
reasonable in their community of practice in their specialized area of
law.  (Decl. of Landau ¶9; Decl. of
Taitelman ¶¶9-11.)  Judgment Debtors do
not object to the reasonableness of Plaintiff’s counsel’s hourly rates.  (See Opposition.)  
The Court
finds Plaintiff’s counsel’s rates to be reasonable and do not warrant a
reduction.  
 
Billed
Hours
The party
seeking fees and costs bears the burden to show “the fees incurred were
allowable, were reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation, and were
reasonable in amount.”  (Nightingale
v. Hyundai Motor America (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 104.) 
In this
case, the declarations and billing records provided by Judgment Creditors’ counsel
are sufficient to meet the burden of proving the reasonableness of the claimed
fees in terms of amounts and tasks. To satisfy this burden, evidence and
descriptions of billable tasks must be presented in sufficient detail, enabling
the court to evaluate whether the case was overstaffed, the time attorneys
spent on specific claims, and the reasonableness of the hours expended.  (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230
Cal.App.4th 459, 486-487.)
Judgment
Creditors’ fee recovery is based on 844.9 hours Judgment Creditors’ counsel
spent on this instant matter from July 1, 2022, through May 31, 2024.  (See Decl. of Landau
¶¶10-15, Exh. A; Decl. of Taitelman ¶¶13, 15, Exh. B.)   The
fees incurred are reasonable, as captured in the billing records submitted to
this Court.  (See Decl. of Landau
¶¶10-15, Exh. A; Decl. of Taitelman ¶¶13, 15, Exh. B.)  Judgment Creditors’ counsel’s billing records
reflect the actual time and clear descriptions of services performed in
connection with litigating this case. 
Although the submission of such detailed time records is not necessary
under California law, if submitted, such records “are entitled to credence in
the absence of a clear indication the records are erroneous.”  (Horsford v. Board of Trustees of
California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 396.)
Judgment
Debtors do not object to the reasonableness of Plaintiff’s counsel’s billed
hours.  (See
Opposition.)  Rather, Judgment Debtors
object to Judgment Creditors’ entire motion on the basis (1) Judgment Creditors
cannot recover the fees incurred in Sina’s bankruptcy case unless and until
they prevail in the pending adversary proceeding; (2) Judgment Creditors’
motion is premature despite the two-year lookback period in C.C.P. §685.080;
(3) none of the fees and costs incurred in the bankruptcy action are
enforceable against Judgment Debtors; (4) any and all fees Judgment Creditors
incurred for its motion to amend judgment are not recoverable under C.C.P.
§686.040 because they constitute prejudgment fees incurred in amending
judgment; (5) even if Judgment Creditors had moved to recover fees incurred in
amending the judgment as prejudgment costs, the motion would still fail because
Judgment Debtors are not parties to the lease; and (6) equity demands that
Judgment Creditors’ claimed fees and costs cannot be imposed against the
Judgment Debtors.  (See
Opposition.)  The Court will address
Judgment Debtors’ arguments as relevant at this juncture.
C.C.P. §685.080(a)
mandates that a motion for attorneys’ fees incurred for enforcement of a
judgment be filed within two years after the fees sought to be recovered were
incurred. Had Judgment Creditors waited to file their motion until after the dischargeability
proceeding in the bankruptcy court was concluded, they would have lost the
ability to claim fees incurred more than two years before. 
Judgment
Debtors suggest that, notwithstanding the mandate that the motion be filed within the
two-year window, this Court should defer deciding this Motion
until after the adversary proceeding has been concluded.  Judgment Debtors’ argument is well taken.
In Jaffe
v. Pacelli (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 927, the judgment creditor Jaffe secured
a judgment against Pacelli, which included an award of attorney’s fees. Pacelli
filed for bankruptcy listing the underlying judgment as her only debt to be
discharged.  Jaffe filed an adversary
proceeding with the bankruptcy court and eventually
succeeded in having Pacelli’s bankruptcy petition dismissed.  In reversing
the trial court’s order denying Jaffe’s motion for post-judgment enforcement
fees and costs incurred in the bankruptcy proceeding, the court of appeal
determined that the fees were recoverable under §685.040, because “Jaffe successfully
blocked Pacelli’s
efforts to have the [judgment] discharged by the bankruptcy court and Jaffe
protected the judgment.” (Jaffe v. Pacelli (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 927, 938.)

Here, unlike
in Jaffe, Judgment
Creditors have not yet achieved this result in the Non-Dischargeability Action.  Judgment Creditors do not cite to any legal
authority that supports an award of post-judgment enforcement fees awarded under
§685.040 that were incurred in another case that was still pending or in which
the judgment creditor was unsuccessful in preserving the judgment.
Accordingly,
the Court continues Judgment Creditors’ motion to a date after the final resolution of the Non-Dischargeability Action
in In re Ramesh Akhtarzad and Sina Akhtarzad, U.S. Bankruptcy Court C.D.
Cal. Case No. 2:11-BK-61640.
 
Costs
Judgment
Creditors request a total of $16,299.21 in costs in the instant motion.  
The Court
will not rule on Judgment Creditors’ requested costs until after the final resolution of the Non-Dischargeability Action in In
re Ramesh Akhtarzad and Sina Akhtarzad, U.S. Bankruptcy Court C.D. Cal.
Case No. 2:11-BK-61640.  Further,
Judgment Creditors have not filed a memorandum of costs related to the costs in
the instant motion.
 
Conclusion
Judgment Creditors’ motion for attorneys’
fees and costs is continued to a date after the final resolution of the
non-dischargeability action in In re Ramesh Akhtarzad and Sina Akhtarzad,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court C.D. Cal. Case No. 2:11-BK-61640.

2.     Undertaking
Sufficiency Motion
Procedural
History
8451
Melrose filed its motion to determine the undertaking is insufficient on
September 12, 2024.  An undertaking bond
in the amount of $12,900,473.40 (“Undertaking”) was filed in this action on
September 17, 2024.  Judgment Debtors
filed their opposition on September 19, 2024. 
Judgment Creditors filed their reply on September 23, 2024.
 
Legal
Standard
C.C.P.
§995.920(b) provides that the beneficiary of a bond given in an action or
proceeding may object to the bond on the ground that the amount of the bond is
insufficient. “The objection shall be in writing and shall be made by noticed
motion.”  (C.C.P. §995.930(a); see
also C.C.P. §996.010(b) [a motion for a determination that a bond is or has
become insufficient “shall be deemed to be an objection to the bond”].)  Unless the parties otherwise agree, the hearing
on the objection must be held not less than two nor more than five days after
service of the notice of motion.  (C.C.P.
§995.950(a).)
Upon
the hearing of the motion, the Court is to make an order determining whether
the bond is insufficient.  (C.C.P.
§995.960(a).)  If the court determines
that the bond is insufficient, it should specify in its order in what respect
the undertaking is insufficient and order that a sufficient bond be given
within five days.  (C.C.P.
§995.960(b)(1).)  “If a sufficient bond
is not given within the time required by the court order, all rights obtained
by giving the bond immediately cease.”  (Id.)
 In the case of an undertaking given for
the purpose of staying enforcement of judgment pending appeal, a determination
that the undertaking was insufficient and a failure to thereafter timely give a
sufficient undertaking will result in enforcement of the judgment appealed from
no longer being stayed.  (C.C.P. §922.)
In
assessing the sufficiency of the amount of an appeal bond, the trial court may
consider postjudgment interest and costs that have accrued on the judgment. (Grant
v. Superior Court (1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 929, 933-935.)
 
Discussion
The
Undertaking on Appeal filed in this action is insufficient.
In
order to stay execution of the Judgment pending appeal, Judgment Debtors must
provide an undertaking.  (C.C.P. §917.1(a).)
 If provided in the form of a bond issued
by an admitted surety insurer, the undertaking amount must be one and one-half
times the amount of the Judgment. 
(C.C.P. §917.1(b).) 
Here,
the Undertaking is for an amount that is far less than what is required.  The amount of the damages awarded in the
original Judgment (which included prejudgment interest) was $11,079,290.83.
(Judgment at pg. 2:10-11.)  The damage award
is not the entirety of the Judgment, though.  The Judgment also awarded $1,322,321.52 in attorneys’
fees and costs incurred through the issuance of the trial referee’s Statement
of Decision (Judgment at pg. 3:4-10), $25,872.50 in attorneys’ fees incurred
between the issuance of the Statement of Decision and the entry of judgment
(Judgment at pg. 3:11-14), and $1,100 in costs incurred between the issuance of
the Statement of Decision and the entry of judgment (Judgment at pg. 3:15-18).  The total Judgment as entered is $12,428,584.85.
 One and one-half times that amount is
$18,642,877.28.
The
$12,900,473.40 amount of the Undertaking is much less than the statutorily
mandated on and one-half time times the amount of the Judgment.  The Undertaking falls short of the statutory
requirement by over $5.7 million, and is therefore facially insufficient.
Taking
into consideration the interest, attorneys’ fees and costs that have accrued in
the six years since the Judgment was entered, the amount of the undertaking
should be significantly more than one and one-half times the principal amount
of the judgment.
The
following table summarizes the amount currently necessary to satisfy the
judgment:

A
motion for attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in connection with the
enforcement of the judgment from June 1, 2022, through May 31, 2024, is continued
to a date after the final resolution of the non-dischargeability action in In
re Ramesh Akhtarzad and Sina Akhtarzad, U.S. Bankruptcy Court C.D. Cal.
Case No. 2:11-BK-61640.
Accordingly,
8451 Melrose Property, LLC’s motion to determine the Undertaking on Appeal
filed in this action is insufficient is granted.  A sufficient new, additional, or supplemental
undertaking must be filed within 5 days of this ruling.
