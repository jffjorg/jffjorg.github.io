Significant Statements:
  - "A party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action." (C.C.P. §2017.010)
  - "Evidence is 'relevant' if it might reasonably assist a party in evaluating its case, preparing for trial, or facilitating a settlement." (Moore v. Mercer (2016) 4 Cal.App.5th 424, 447)
  - "Courts have uniformly held that, for discovery purposes, information should be regarded as 'relevant' to the subject matter if it might reasonably assist a party in evaluating the case, preparing for trial, or facilitating settlement." (Stewart v. Colonial Western Agency, Inc. (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 1006, 1013)
  - "Any claim of undue burden by the responding party must be substantiated by evidence." (Coriell v. Superior Court (1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 487, 492-493)

Should Defendant determine that the information sought in the RFPs is private, proprietary, and/or confidential, it should move for a protective order rather than lodging such an objection."
