And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled that:

* Judgment Creditors' motion for attorneys' fees and costs is continued to a date after the final resolution of the non-dischargeability action in In re Ramesh Akhtarzad and Sina Akhtarzad, U.S. Bankruptcy Court C.D. Cal. Case No. 2:11-BK-61640.
* 8451 Melrose Property, LLC's motion to determine the sufficiency of the Undertaking on Appeal filed in this action is insufficient, and a sufficient new, additional, or supplemental undertaking must be filed within 5 days of this ruling.

The judge has also found that the amount of the Undertaking on Appeal is insufficient, as it falls short of the statutorily mandated one and one-half times the amount of the Judgment. The judge has ordered that a sufficient new, additional, or supplemental undertaking must be filed within 5 days of this ruling.
