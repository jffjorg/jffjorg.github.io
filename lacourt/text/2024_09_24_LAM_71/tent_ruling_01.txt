AMERICAN

 Case No.:  23STCV21957
 
 
 
 Hearing
  Date:  September 24, 2024



 
Plaintiff Shruthi Raghavendra’s motion to compel Defendant American
Honda Motor Co., Inc. to provide further responses to its Request for Production of Documents (Set One) Nos. 16-21 is granted.  Defendant
is ordered to produce Code-compliant responses without boilerplate objections
within 10 days.
 
          Plaintiff Shruthi Raghavendra (“Raghavendra”)
(“Plaintiff”) moves to compel further responses to its Request for Production
of Documents (Set One) (“RFP”) Nos. 16-21 from Defendant American
Honda Motor Co., Inc. (“AHM”) (“Defendant”) and to strike
Defendant’s objections.  (Notice of
Motion, pgs. 1-2; C.C.P. §2031.310.)
 
Meet and Confer
On February 28, 2024, the parties participated in an
Informal Discovery Conference on the instant motion.  After discussion, this Court deemed the
issues resolved.  (2/28/24 Minute Order
IDC.)
 
Background
          On September
25, 2023, Plaintiff propounded its RFP on Defendant.  (Decl. of Bedwan ¶13, Exh. 2.)  On November 8, 2023, per a mutually
agreed-upon extension, Defendant electronically served its unverified responses
to the RFP, which were not code-compliant, nor were they accompanied by any
document production.  (Decl. of Bedwan ¶14,
Exh. 3.)  Defendant served verifications
on December 20, 2023.  (Decl. of Bedwan
¶15, Exh. 4.)
On February 28, 2024, Counsels for the parties
attended an Informal Discovery Conference (“IDC”) in this Court.  (Decl. of Bedwan ¶22.)  During the discussion, Defendant agreed to
provide code-compliant supplemental responses to Requests 16-21 of Plaintiff’s RFP.
 (2/29/24 Notice of IDC Outcome.)  
On April 25, 2024, Plaintiff emailed Defendant to
inquire about the supplemental responses and document production discussed at
the IDC.  (Decl. of Bedwan ¶23, Exh.
12.)  On April 25, 2024, Defendant
responded to Plaintiff’s email stating that it had incorrectly calendared the
date for production and that Plaintiff could expect the supplemental responses
and documentation by the next week at the latest.  (Decl. of Bedwan ¶24, Exh. 13.)
After still not receiving the at-issue responses and
documents, Plaintiff followed up with Defendant via email on May 16, 2024,
inviting Defendant to discuss the matter via telephone.  (Decl. of Bedwan ¶25, Exh. 14.)  On May 16, 2024, Counsels for the parties met
and conferred telephonically and agreed that Plaintiff’s deadline to file the
present Motion would be on June 25, 2024. 
(Decl. of Bedwan ¶26, Exh. 15.)  To
date, Defendant has not produced a supplemental response or document in
response to Plaintiff’s RFP.  (Decl. of
Bedwan ¶27.)
          Plaintiff
filed the instant motion on June 26, 2024. 
Defendant filed its opposition on September 11, 2024.  Plaintiff filed her reply on September 16,
2024.
 
          Discussion
A “party may obtain discovery regarding any matter,
not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending
action . . . if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.”  (C.C.P. §2017.010.)  “[A] civil litigant’s right to discovery is
broad” and the “statutes governing discovery must be construed liberally in
favor of disclosure.”  (Williams v.
Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 541.) 
“[E]vidence is ‘relevant’ if it might reasonably
assist a party in evaluating its case, preparing for trial, or facilitating a
settlement.”  (Moore v. Mercer (2016)
4 Cal.App.5th 424, 447).  A party is
entitled to discover “any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the
subject matter involved in the pending action.”  (C.C.P. §2017.010.)  The phrase “subject matter” is broader than
relevancy to the issues (which determines admissibility of evidence at trial).  (Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1384, 1392.)  Courts
have uniformly held that, for discovery purposes, information should be
regarded as “relevant” to the subject matter if it might reasonably assist a
party in evaluating the case, preparing for trial, or facilitating settlement.  (Stewart v. Colonial Western Agency, Inc. (2001)
87 Cal.App.4th 1006, 1013.)
RFP Nos. 16-23 seek basic documents relating to Defendant’s
internal investigation and analysis of the defects plaguing Plaintiff’s vehicle
and establishing that Defendant previously knew of such Defects but
nevertheless failed to repurchase the vehicle.  This information is relevant and should not be
onerous for Defendant to provide. 
Further, Defendant agreed to provide supplemental responses to Plaintiff
at the IDC and has failed to follow through.
Defendant’s objection to Plaintiff’s discovery
requests on the basis they are overbroad in terms of time, scope, and defined
defects is unavailing.  Plaintiff has
narrowly tailored the requests to documents concerning only air conditioning
defects in vehicles of the same year, make, and model as Plaintiff’s vehicle.
Furthermore, the defect definition was carefully constructed based upon
Plaintiff’s documented complaints and repairs, as well as from Defendant’s own language
taken from its own Technical Service Bulletins (“TSB”).
Defendant’s Opposition sets forth unsupported
assertions about the burden of compliance. However, Defendant’s discussion of
the alleged burden does not contain a single citation to any evidentiary
material.  Any claim of undue burden by the
responding party must be substantiated by evidence.  (See Coriell v. Superior Court (1974)
39 Cal.App.3d 487, 492-493 [holding that answering an interrogatory would
require “considerable effort” and that “‘many hundreds of man hours’ and
‘approximately nine months’ [would] be required to supply answers” was
conclusory and not factual in nature—accordingly, the trial court erred in
relieving the responding party from providing further responses].) 
Here, Defendant offers no factual support regarding
the alleged costs of document production.  (Comstock v. Humphries (2015) 786
F.3d 701, 709 [“[A]rguments in briefs are not evidence.”].)  Defendant’s Opposition and the Declaration of
Samantha Koopersmith are silent as to the specific nature of the burden such as
time, labor, and monetary costs or prejudice incurred.  Defendant’s objection on the basis of burden
is unavailing.
Defendant’s objection to production on the basis of
trade secrets and confidentiality are both unavailing. Should Defendant determine
that the information sought in the RFPs is private, proprietary, and/or
confidential, it should move for a protective order rather than lodging such an
objection.  (See C.C.P.
§2031.060(b).)
Accordingly, Defendant is ordered to provide
substantive, responsive answers without boilerplate objections to RFP Nos.
16-23 within 10 days.
 
Conclusion
          Plaintiff’s
motion to compel further responses to RFP Nos. 16-23 from Defendant is
granted.  Defendant is ordered to produce
Code-compliant responses without boilerplate objections within 10 days.
Moving Party is to give
notice of this ruling.
