```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to strike the defendant's answer. The plaintiff had argued that the defendant's answer was improperly filed because it was not signed by the defendant's attorney of record and because the defendant did not take any action to vacate the default entered on July 03, 2023. The defendant had argued that the court's order vacating the default and default judgment on December 12, 2023, meant that the defendant's answer was properly filed. The court agrees with the defendant and finds that the plaintiff's motion is improper. The court also corrects its prior order to specify that the default entered on July 03, 2023, is set aside in addition to the default judgment being vacated.
