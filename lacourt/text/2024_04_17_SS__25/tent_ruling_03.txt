Plaintiff brings the motion under CCP §§ 664.6 and 1032, asserting  that Defendant has defaulted on his monthly payments under the stipulation, and  that despite Plaintiff’s counsel providing several notices regarding the missed  payments as required by the Agreement, Defendant has failed to remedy his  default. Thus, because of the payment default, Plaintiff brings the instant  motion.     OPPOSITION               No  opposition has been filed.    REPLY               No reply  has been filed.    ANALYSIS   I.          Legal  Standard Code of Civil Procedure section  664.6 (“CCP § 664.6”) states: “If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a  writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally  before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon  motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If  requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to  enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the  settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (a) [emphasis added].) For  purposes of the statute, “a writing is signed by a party if it is signed by any  of the following [among other individuals]: (1) ¶ The party. (2) ¶ An attorney  who represents the party.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (b) [emphasis  added].)    “On a motion to enforce, the court  must determine whether the settlement agreement is valid and binding.  [Citation.] The court assesses whether the material terms of the settlement  were reasonably well-defined and certain, and whether the parties expressly  acknowledged that they understood and agreed to be bound by those terms. [In  re Marriage of Assemi (1994) 7 Cal.4th 896, 911.]” (Estate of  Jones (2022) 82 Cal.App.5th 948, 952.)    The court may interpret the terms  and conditions of a settlement (Fiore v. Alvord (1985) 182 Cal.App.3d  561, 566), but the court may not create material terms of a settlement, as  opposed to deciding what terms the parties themselves have previously agreed  upon (Weddington Productions, Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th  793, 810).   II.        Discussion    A.  Retention of Jurisdiction              “‘[V]oluntary dismissal of an action or special  proceeding terminates the court’s jurisdiction over the matter.’ (Conservatorship  of Martha P. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 857, 867.) ‘If requested by the  parties,’ however, ‘the [trial] court may retain jurisdiction over the parties  to enforce [a] settlement until performance in full of the terms of the  settlement.’ (§ 664.6, italics added.)” (Mesa RHF Partners, L.P. v. City of  Los Angeles (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 913, 917.) “‘Because of its summary  nature, strict compliance with the requirements of section 664.6 is  prerequisite to invoking the power of the court to impose a settlement  agreement.’” (Id. (quoting Sully-Miller Contracting Co. v.  Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 30, 37).)   “A request for the trial court to retain jurisdiction  under section 664.6 ‘must conform to the same three requirements which the  Legislature and the courts have deemed necessary for section 664.6 enforcement  of the settlement itself: the request must be made (1) during the pendency of  the case, not after the case has been dismissed in its entirety, (2) by the  parties themselves, and (3) either in a writing signed by the parties or orally  before the court.’” (Id. (quoting Wackeen v. Malis (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th  429, 440).) “The ‘request must be express, not implied from other language, and  it must be clear and unambiguous.’” (Id. (quoting Wackeen, supra,  97 Cal.App.4th at 440).)   Here,  the parties signed a stipulation containing the parties’ agreement for the  Court to retain jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure §664.6 to enforce  the terms of the Stipulation and enter judgment in the event of default. (See 02-03-20  Stipulation.) Before dismissing the action, the parties signed the Stipulation  and submitted it to the Court. (Id.  at p. 3.) On February 18, 2020, the Court dismissed the entire case without  prejudice, according to the Stipulation, and expressly stated that it “shall  retain jurisdiction pursuant to CCP § 664.6.” (See 02-18-20 Order.) Therefore,  the Court finds that the Stipulation complies with the requirements under CCP §  664.6, and it has retained jurisdiction to enter judgment pursuant to the  parties’ Stipulation in this action.   B.  Entry of Judgment    The Settlement  Agreement, filed on February 03, 2020, provides that the parties agreed to  settle the matter for $4,533.60, with Defendant’s insurance carrier making an initial  payment of $2,122.60. (Richard L. Mahfouz II Decl. ¶ 6, Exh. A.) Defendant  would subsequently make monthly payments of $50.00 beginning no later than December  15, 2019, and on the 15th of every month thereafter until the  remaining settlement amount of $2,400.00 was paid in full. (Id.) Plaintiff  provides the Court with the declaration of its counsel who avers that  Defendant’s insurance carrier made the one-time payment of $2,122.60 on January  20, 2020. (Id. ¶ 7.) Counsel states that to date, Plaintiff has only received  $1,170.00 payments from the Defendant. (Id. ¶  9.) Counsel further avers that his office provided several written notices, regarding  the default to the Defendant on 09/05/23, 10/31/23, and 01/26/24, pursuant to  the Agreement, and that to date Defendant has failed to remedy the default. (Id. ¶¶ 9-10; Exh. B.) Per the Agreement, if  no payment correcting the default was made within ten (10) days of issuing  written notice, Plaintiff was entitled to request an Entry of Judgment. (Id. ¶ 8; Exh. A p. 7 ¶ 7.) Thus, due to  Defendant’s failure to comply with the Settlement Agreement, Plaintiff  requested that a judgment be entered against the Defendant. (Id. ¶ 11.) The Court  finds the Settlement Agreement valid and enforceable under CCP § 664.6. Here,  Plaintiff provides evidence that the Defendant has not made any payments or  cured the default after Plaintiff sent notices. (Mahfouz  II Decl. ¶¶ 9-10.) Therefore, since a valid and signed  settlement agreement between the parties has been breached, and the Court  retains jurisdiction to enter judgment, the motion satisfies the requirements  under CCP § 664.6. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Vacate Dismissal and  Enter Judgment is GRANTED. Dismissal entered on February 18, 2020, is vacated.  Judgment is entered for Plaintiff and against the Defendant in the amount of $4,402.76 for  the following: the principal amount of $6,533.36 less $3,292.60  in payments made by Defendant and Defendant’s insurance carrier, plus interest  of $320.00, accrued at 7% per annum since the date of default on June 15, 2023,  court cost totaling $360.00, and $482.00 in attorney’s fee.   III.       Conclusion               Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Auto Insurance Co.’s Motion  to Vacate the Dismissal Entered on 02/18/2020, Enforce the Settlement  Agreement, and Enter Judgment is GRANTED.   Judgment Pursuant to Stipulation (CCP 664.6) is entered  for Plaintiff and against the Defendant in the amount of $4,402.76.   Moving party is ordered to give  notice.
