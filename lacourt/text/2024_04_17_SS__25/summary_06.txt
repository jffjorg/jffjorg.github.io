**Tentative Ruling**

The court has reviewed the motion filed by Defendant Charlotte McKenzie Free aka Charlotte Free Sanchez to set aside the default and default judgment entered against her. The court finds that the motion is not timely filed, as it was filed over 180 days after the default judgment was entered.

The court also finds that Defendant has not overcome the presumption established by the Proof of Service filed by Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company. The Proof of Service shows that service of summons was properly rendered at the defendant's address, and the court finds that the defendant has not shown that the lack of actual notice was not caused by her own avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect.

Therefore, the court denies Defendant's motion to set aside the default and default judgment.
