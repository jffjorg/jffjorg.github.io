BACKGROUND
 
On May 03, 2023, Plaintiff Arden
Silverman (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint for common counts against Defendant
International Cosmetics & Regulatory Specialist LLC (“Defendant”).
 
On July 03, 2023, Plaintiff moved for default to be entered
against the Defendant, and the Clerk entered default against Defendant the same
day. 
 
On July 26, 2023, the Court entered default judgment
against the Defendant in the amount of $15,444.37. 
 
On September 14, 2023, Defendant filed a Motion to Vacate
Default Judgment. The Court continued the hearing pursuant to Defendant’s
request, after noting several deficiencies with the motion. 
 
On November 02, 2023, Defendant filed a Motion to Vacate
Default Judgment. The Court granted Defendant’s motion, vacated the Default and
Default Judgment, and deemed Defendant’s proposed Answer of December 12, 2023,
filed. 
 
On December 18, 2023, the Court reassigned the matter to
Commissioner Latrice A.G. Byrdsong in Department 25 at the Spring Street
Courthouse. 
 
On January 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion
to Strike Answer of Defendant. Defendant responds in opposition. Plaintiff
files in reply. 
 
 
MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
            Plaintiff
prays for the Court to issue an order, striking Defendant’s Answer filed on
December 12, 2023, on the ground that the Answer filed on behalf of the
Defendant is not signed by Defendant’s counsel of record and is subject to be stricken
under CCP § 1250.330. Plaintiff further argues that since Defendant did not
seek a set aside of the default entered on July 03, 2023, Defendant’s Answer is
improperly filed. 
 
OPPOSITION
 
            In
opposition, Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s motion should be denied in its entirety
because it is untimely under CCP § 435 as Plaintiff did not file a motion to
strike within ten days from the date Defendant filed its Answer. Defendant
further argues that the Court set aside both the default and default judgement
in its December 12, 2023, Order. 
 
REPLY
 
            In reply, Plaintiff
reasserts that Defendant has not set aside the July 03, 2023, default.
Plaintiff further argues that the motion is timely because CRC Rule 3.1322(b) does
not impose a time limit to file a motion to strike an Answer within ten days as
asserted by the Defendant.
 
ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard
            “Where a party is represented by an
attorney, his pleading need not be verified but shall be signed by the attorney
for the party. The signature of the attorney constitutes a certificate by him
that he has read the pleading and that to the best of his knowledge,
information, and belief there is ground to support it. If the pleading is not
signed or is signed with intent to defeat the purposes of this section, it may
be stricken.” (Code of Civ. Proc. § 1250.330.)
 
 
II.        Discussion 
 
            Plaintiff moves for the Court to issue an order striking
Defendant’s Answer to the Complaint. As a preliminary matter, the Court’s order
will address Plaintiff’s motion under CCP 1250.330 as provided in Plaintiff’s
notice of Motion. 
 
            Plaintiff asserts that ecause the
answer filed on behalf of the Defendant is not signed by the Defendant’s
attorney of record, the answer is subject to be stricken per CCP § 1250.330. Plaintiff
further argues that because the Defendant did not take any action to vacate the
entry of default of July 03, 2023, Defendant’s Answer is improperly filed. 
 
             The Court finds Plaintiff’s motion improper. Per
the Court’s December 12, 2023, Minute Order, the Court clearly allowed the
Defendant’s Answer to be filed in granting Defendant’s Motion to Vacate Default
Judgment. Indeed, the Pulte court held that setting aside default
judgment without setting aside the default would be an “idle act” and thus not
permitted…. (Pulte Homes Corp. v. Williams
Mechanical, Inc. (2016) 2 CA5th 267, 273.) Upon reviewing the
Court’s prior order, the Court’s order vacated both the default entered on July
03 and the default judgment on July 26, 2023. Although the Court’s order did
not specify that default was set aside, the Court’s December 12th order clearly
stated that, “The defendant's proposed answer is deemed filed this date.”
(12/12/23 Minute Order.) 
 
Therefore, Plaintiff’s Motion to
Strike is DENIED. The Court on its own motion corrects its Order Entered on
December 12, 2023, Nunc Pro Tunc, to specify that the default entered on July
03, 2023, is set aside, in addition to default judgment being vacated. 
 
III.       Conclusion 
            
            Plaintiff Arden Silverman’s Motion to Strike is DENIED. 
 
Moving Party is ordered to give notice.
