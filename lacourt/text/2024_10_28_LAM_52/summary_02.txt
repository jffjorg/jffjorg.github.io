Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Yu Sun Um's motion for leave to intervene and to expunge a lis pendens recorded by Sarah Woo. Um, who acquired title to the subject property on April 8, 2024, moves to intervene in the action and to expunge the lis pendens, which was recorded on April 15, 2024. Woo argues that Um's motion improperly combines applications for separate relief and that the lis pendens is valid. The judge disagrees, finding that Woo failed to comply with the statutory requirements for recording and serving the lis pendens.

The judge grants Um's motion to intervene for the purposes of moving to expunge the notice of pendency of action and grants the motion to expunge the lis pendens. The judge finds that Woo failed to provide substantial notice to Um, who was not aware of the action until August 2024, and that the lis pendens is void and invalid.

The judge also denies Um's motion to file a proposed complaint in intervention and denies Um's request for $7,500 in attorney fees or sanctions against Woo and Woo's counsel. The judge finds that Woo acted with substantial justification in opposing Um's motion. The judge orders the notice of pendency of action to be expunged and sets a hearing date for October 28, 2024.
