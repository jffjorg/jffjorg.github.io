And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiffs' ex parte application to advance the hearing on their motion for leave to file a third amended complaint. However, the judge has denied the plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a third amended complaint. The motion is defective because it does not include a copy of the proposed amendment or amended pleading, and because the declaration of plaintiffs' counsel does not provide sufficient information about the effect of the amendment, why it is necessary, and when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered. The proposed third amended complaint also makes a substantial change to the factual allegations regarding the ownership of the company, and the court will not permit the plaintiffs to do so surreptitiously without explanation.
