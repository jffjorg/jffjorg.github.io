And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Zhiwei Chen, has moved the court to reconsider its order dated September 24, 2024, which stated that the case was complete since it had not been remanded to the trial court within 90 days of the defendant's notice of removal to federal court. The plaintiff argues that the order should be vacated because they filed a motion to remand the case to state court in the federal proceeding, which is still pending. However, the judge finds that this is not a sufficient basis to reconsider the prior order, and that the case will only be reopened if the federal court grants the plaintiff's motion to remand. Therefore, the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration is denied.
