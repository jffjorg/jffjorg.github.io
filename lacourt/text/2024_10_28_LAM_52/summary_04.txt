Significant statements:
  - "A cause of action for extortion seeks 'recovery of money obtained by the wrongful threat of criminal or civil prosecution.'"
  - "It is essentially a cause of action for moneys obtained by duress, a form of fraud."
  - "Plaintiffs do not allege they paid the money defendants demanded."
  - "Plaintiffs' cause of action for attempted extortion has the same fatal flaw."
  - "The elements of this cause of action are: (1) extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendant with the intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of causing, emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff's suffering severe or extreme emotional distress; and (3) actual and proximate causation of the emotional distress by the defendant's outrageous conduct."
  - "Plaintiffs allege, '[W]ithin the past few months and while claiming to be 'experienced' and 'deep-pocketed' business-people who simply wanted to 'negotiate' an overdue debt, Defendants instead threatened the lives and safety of the individual Plaintiffs, threatened to make false and defamatory statements about Plaintiffs to third parties with whom Plaintiffs have existing business relationships, and more broadly threatened to 'destroy' Plaintiffs' business and market reputation through defamation and other tortious misconduct."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a demurrer to the first amended complaint by the plaintiffs, SMC Specialty Finance, LLC, Gary Raskin, and Alastair Burlingham, against defendant Danny Chan. The judge rules that the demurrer is sustained with 20 days' leave to amend on the first cause of action (attempted extortion) and overruled on the second and third causes of action (intentional infliction of emotional distress and unfair competition). The judge concludes that the plaintiffs' allegations of attempted extortion are insufficient because they do not allege that they paid the money demanded by the defendants. However, the judge finds that the plaintiffs' allegations of intentional infliction of emotional distress are sufficient, as they allege that the defendants made threats of harm or death to the plaintiffs and their families, and that the defendants engaged in a campaign of physical, verbal, and written threats to physically harm the plaintiffs. The judge also finds that the plaintiffs' allegations of unfair competition are sufficient, as they allege that the defendants attempted to extort money from the plaintiffs and engaged in a campaign of threats and intimidation.
