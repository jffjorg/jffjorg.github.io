 Case Number:  24STCV09973    Hearing Date:   October 28, 2024    Dept:  52 Plaintiff
Zhiwei Chen’s Motion for Reconsideration
Plaintiff Zhiwei Chen moves the court to
reconsider its order dated September 24, 2024. 
On June 24, 2024, defendant Allstate Northbrook Indemnity Company filed
a notice of removal to federal court.  On
September 24, this court issued an order stating, “This case is now recorded as
completed as the matter has not been remanded to the trial court within ninety
(90) days from the Notice of Removal.”  Plaintiff
argues that order should be vacated because, in the federal proceeding,
plaintiff filed a motion to remand the case to state court, which remains
pending.  (Chen Decl., Ex. A.)  That is not a sufficient basis to reconsider
the prior order.  If the federal court
grants plaintiff’s motion to remand the case to this court, this proceeding
will be reopened.  Reconsidering or
vacating the September 24 order is unnecessary.
Plaintiff Zhiwei Chen’s motion for
reconsideration is denied.
