And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment and granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff, Breckenridge Property Fund 2016 LLC, brought an unlawful detainer action against the defendants, Ji Hong Chung and Ji Hyun Chung, to evict them from the property located at 3924 Park Place, Unit # 3, Montrose, CA 91020. The defendants failed to vacate and remain in possession of the property after receiving a notice to quit on May 27, 2024. The plaintiff provided sufficient evidence showing that the foreclosure was in accordance with California law and that it is a bona fide third-party purchaser. The defendants failed to file an opposition to the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, and therefore, the court finds that there is no triable issue of material fact and grants the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment.
