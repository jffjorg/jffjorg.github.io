And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and dismiss the PAGA action. The plaintiff had alleged that the defendant, a janitorial company, had committed multiple violations of California labor laws, including failure to maintain accurate records, non-compliant meal and rest periods, failure to pay minimum and overtime wages, and failure to reimburse business expenses. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's claims were subject to arbitration under a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) that required arbitration of PAGA claims. The judge found that the CBA satisfied all the requirements of Labor Code section 2699.8, which exempts certain janitorial employees from PAGA claims if they are represented by a labor organization that meets specific criteria. The judge also found that the plaintiff was represented by the union, despite not being a member, and therefore was bound by the terms of the CBA. As a result, the judge dismissed the PAGA action and ordered the plaintiff to arbitrate his individual claims.
