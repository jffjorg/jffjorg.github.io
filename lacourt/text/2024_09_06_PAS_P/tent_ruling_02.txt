 Case Number:  23AHCV02146    Hearing Date:   September 6, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE]
ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO SET ASIDE DEFAULT I.        INTRODUCTION
          In this breach of contract action, Plaintiff San Van High Technology
Co. (Plaintiff) alleges that it entered a contract with Defendants Tians LLC,
Cahm LLC, Cayg LLC, Jack Gu, Jing Chen, Diamond Ridge Corp. and JL Capital
Resources Inc. (JL Capital) for the purchase of real property at 14814 Castle
Butte Rd., North Edwards, California 93523. San Van alleges that the purchase
included the business defendants ran at the property, defendants’ Industrial
Hemp Cultivation License and three separate APNs: 23348030005, 23348029003,
23348005003. It is alleged that Defendants retained Plaintiff’s initial deposit
of $700,000 after the purchase fell apart.
          The complaint contains ten causes of action: (1) breach of
contract, (2) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,
(3) unjust enrichment, (4) conversion, (5) negligence/professional malpractice,
(6) breach of fiduciary duty, (7) common count- open book account, (8) common
count- money had and received, (9) common count-money paid, laid out and
expended, (10) common count-mistaken receipt. 
          On June 5, 2024, default was entered against Defendant JL
Capital. 
          On June 27, 2024, Defendant JL Capital filed the instant
motion to set aside the default. The hearing for the motion was initially set
for July 22, 2024, but due to the Court’s network and connectivity problems,
was continued to its current date on September 6, 2024. 
          On July 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed its opposition to the
motion to set aside. 
          On July 15, 2024, JL Capital filed its reply.
          Because JL Capital has established grounds for relief from
the default entered on June 5, 2024, the Court GRANTS the motion.  
          
II.      LEGAL
STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b) (“Section 473(b)”) provides a
means for relief from default that was entered as a result of mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. The statute has a discretionary provision,
which states: “The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or
his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other
proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) The
statute also contains a mandatory provision that states: “Notwithstanding any
other requirements of this section, the court shall, whenever an application
for relief is made no more than six months after entry of judgment, is in
proper form, and is accompanied by an attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to
his or her own mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, vacate any (1)
resulting default entered by the clerk against his or her client, and which
will result in the entry of a default judgment, or (2) resulting default
judgment or dismissal entered against his or her client, unless the court finds
that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the attorney’s mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.”  
When
statutory relief is unavailable, “‘a trial court may ... [also] vacate a
default on equitable grounds ….’ [Citation].” (Sakaguchi v. Sakaguchi (2009)
173 Cal.App.4th 852, 862.) 
Equitable
relief may be based on “extrinsic fraud” or “extrinsic mistake.”  (Luxury Asset Lending, LLC v. Philadelphia
Television Network, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 894, 911 (“Luxury Asset”).)
Extrinsic
fraud “‘usually arises when a party is denied a fair adversary hearing because
he has been “deliberately kept in ignorance of the action or proceeding, or in
some other way fraudulently prevented from presenting his claim or defense.”’
[Citation.]” (Luxury Asset, supra, 56 Cal.App.5th at pp.
910-911.)  
“‘“‘Extrinsic mistake involves the
excusable neglect of a party. [Citation.] When this neglect results in an
unjust judgment, without a fair adversary hearing, and the basis for equitable
relief is present, this is extrinsic mistake. [Citation.]’”’ [Citation.]” (Luxury
Asset, supra, 56 Cal.App.5th at p. 911.)
III.     ANALYSIS
JL
Capital moves to set aside the default entered on June 5, 2024, pursuant to Section
473(b)’s discretionary provision or, alternatively, on the ground of extrinsic
mistake.  
The
Court finds the motion is timely under Section 473(b) because it is brought
within six (6) months of the entry of default. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd.
(b) [“Application for this relief … shall be made within a reasonable time, in
no case exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or
proceeding was taken”].)
The
Court also finds that the defendant has established “mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or excusable neglect” within the meaning of Section 473(b), that
warrants vacating the default for the following reasons. 
“Within
the context of section 473(b) neglect is excusable if a reasonably prudent
person under similar circumstances might have made the same error.” (Austin
v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist. (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 918, 929; see
also Younessi v. Woolf (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 1137, 1146 [“‘“A party who
seeks relief under section 473 on the basis of mistake or inadvertence of
counsel must demonstrate that such mistake, inadvertence, or general neglect
was excusable.”’ [Citation.] We must ask ‘“whether ‘a reasonably prudent person
under the same or similar circumstances’ might have made the same error.[ ]”’
[Citation]”].)
“It
is … well established that it is the policy of the law to bring about a trial
on the merits whenever possible, so that any doubts which may exist should be
resolved in favor of the application, to the end of securing to a litigant his
day in court and a trial upon the merits.” (Frank E. Beckett Co. v.
Bobbitt (1960) 180 Cal.App.2d Supp. 921, 928.)
Here,
JL Capital has submitted the declaration of its CEO Leann Li (“Li”), who testifies
that no one at JL Capital, including her, was ever served with the complaint in
this action. (Motion, Li Decl., ¶ 7.) Li also testifies as follows. On
September 20, 2023 (a few days after this lawsuit was filed), she filed JL
Capital’s updated State of Information with the California Secretary of State,
listing her house, 514 W. Lemon Ave., Arcadia, CA 91007, as JL Capital’s
address (the “Arcadia Address”). (Li Decl., ¶ 8.) However, Li further
testifies, she often stays overnight at her brother’s house in Orange County
and her tenants in the Arcadia Address are the ones that forward her mail for
her. (Li Decl., ¶ 9.) Li states that she never received copies of the complaint
or any other document regarding this action at the Arcadia Address before
receiving Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment. (Li Decl., ¶ 9.)
The
Court finds that through Li’s declaration, JL Capital has established mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect within the meaning of Section
473(b); in other words, it was excusable neglect to have expected Li’s tenants
to forward mail regarding JL Capital to her. (Cf. Bernards v. Grey
(1950) 97 Cal.App.2d 672, 682-686 [finding excusable neglect where a party was
personally served a summons and complaint but then “placed them in his
briefcase, merely noting that they referred to the present action and through
inadvertence, did not call to counsel’s attention the papers he had received
and was not at said time aware of their nature”]; Benjamin v. Dalmo Mfg. Co.
(1948) 31 Cal.2d 523, 526-27 [finding excusable neglect where secretary
misunderstood the directions given to her by the president of the company and
failed to forward the papers to Defendant’s attorney]; Gorman v. California
Transit Co. (1926) 199 Cal. 246, 248-249 [upholding order vacating a
default judgment due to failure to answer because after service of the summons
and complaint on the secretary of the corporation, the summons and complaint
were mistakenly taken by an employee from the desk of one who was to notify the
president of the corporation, and filed].) 
Plaintiff’s
argument that it attempted to serve JL Capital several times at the Arcadia
Address to no avail and even obtained an order from this Court allowing it to
serve the defendant through the California Secretary of State is unpersuasive
in light of Li’s undisputed testimony that JL Capital never received a copy of
the summons or complaint in time to respond to the complaint.
For
those reasons, the Court GRANTS the motion to set aside the default pursuant to
Section 473(b). 
 
IV.     CONCLUSION
AND ORDER JL Capital’s motion to set aside is granted.
The Court sets aside the default entered on June 5, 2024, against JL Capital.
The defendant is ordered to file and serve its proposed answer within twenty days of this ruling.
Defendant to give notice of this order.
