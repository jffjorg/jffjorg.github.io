 Case Number:  24PDUD01967    Hearing Date:   September 6, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE]  ORDER DENYING DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT INTRODUCTION            This action is for unlawful detainer  following a foreclosure sale held on 03/21/2024 with the Trustee's Deed Upon  Sale recorded on 05/15/2024. The foreclosed property is 3924 Park Place, Unit #  3, Montrose, CA 91020 (“Premises”). The notice to quit was served on 5/27/2024,  and the Defendants failed to vacate and remain in possession.            On June 3, 2024, Plaintiff  Breckenridge Property Fund 2016 LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed the complaint against  Defendants Ji Hong Chung and Ji Hyun Chung.             On August 13, 2024, Defendant Ji Hong  Chung filed the instant motion for summary judgment.             On August 28, 2024, Plaintiff filed  its opposition to Defendant’s motion for summary judgment. On the same day, Plaintiff  filed its own motion for summary judgment or in the alternative summary  adjudication to which Defendant Ji Hong Chung failed to file an opposition.             As of September 3, 2024, Defendant  has not filed a reply for Plaintiff’s opposition.               II.       LEGAL  STANDARD            Summary judgment is appropriately granted where it is  shown that an action has no merit or that there is no defense to the action.  Code Civ. Proc. §437c(a).             A cause of action has no merit if one of the following  exists: (1) one or more necessary element cannot be established; (2) a  defendant establishes an affirmative defense. Section §437c(o).            A motion for summary judgment shall be granted where all  the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue of material fact and  that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Section  437c(c).            Summary adjudication may be granted where it completely  disposes of a cause of action, an affirmative defense, a claim of damages, or  an issue of duty. Section 437c(f).   III.     ANALYSIS            A. Summary of Pleading            On March 21, 2024, Plaintiff became the owner of the real  property located at 3924 Park Place, Unit # 3, Montrose, CA 91020, by  purchasing said property at a foreclosure sale. Per the recitations within the  Deed, said foreclosure sale and all preceding notices and actions were done in  accordance with Cal. Civ Code section 2924. Title under this sale has  been duly perfected as the Trustee's Deed Upon Sale was recorded on May 15,  2024.             On  May 27, 2024, Plaintiff caused to be served on Defendants a written notice in  compliance with the Code of Civil Procedure, Section 1161 (a) & (b),  requiring and demanding that Defendants quit and deliver up possession of the  premises to Plaintiff. No landlord/tenant relationship exists between the  purchaser and the Defendants. The notice expired on its own terms on May 30,  2024. Defendant has failed to vacate and remains in possession of the  premises.                  B. Judicial Notice             Defendant, Ji Hong Chung (“Defendant”), requests that the  Court take judicial notice pursuant to the provisions of Evidence Code sections  451 through 453 of the following documents:             Ex. 102 - Certified copy of Deed of Trust, recorded on  05/30/2006, as Instrument No. 06 1172450 of the Official Records of Los Angeles  County.            Ex. 103 - Authenticated copy of Code of Civil Procedure  Section 1161(a)            The Court takes judicial notice of the documents.             C. Merits             Defendant Ji Hong Chung requests that the Court grant this  motion for summary judgment on the grounds that Plaintiff’s action has no merit  because Defendant allegedly did not receive the notice of default. (Mot. at p.  5.) In opposition, Plaintiff argues that Defendant’s motion is based upon two  logical fallacies and therefore fails. (Opp. at p. 3.) Specifically, Plaintiff  argues that Defendant has not offered sufficient admissible evidence to create  a triable issue of fact whether Plaintiff, a third-party purchaser and stranger  to pre-sale transactions and occurrences, is a bona fide purchaser for value  and without notice. (Opp. at p. 6.) Moreover, Plaintiff argues that Defendant’s  argument that she did not receive notice of default is not an available defense  as a matter of law. (Id. at p. 5.)            The elements for Plaintiff’s case pursuant to CCP section 1161(a)(b)(3)  are: (1) foreclosure in accordance with the CCP and perfection of title; (2) service  of a notice to quit; and (3) Defendant’s failure to quit and deliver  possession.            In support of the motion, Defendant provides the Deed of  Trust showing the following language: “The notice of acceleration and  opportunity to cure given to Borrower pursuant to Section 22 and the  notice of acceleration given to Borrower pursuant to Section 18 shall be deemed  to satisfy the notice and opportunity to take corrective action provisions of  this Section 20.” (Id. at ¶ 2; RJN Ex. 102 at p. 12.) The Deed of Trust  also states “22. Acceleration; Remedies. Lender shall give notice  to Borrower prior to acceleration following Borrower's breach of any covenant  or agreement in this Security Instrument (but not prior to acceleration under  Section 18 unless Applicable Law provides otherwise). The notice shall specify:  (a) the default; (b) the action required to cure the default; (c) a date, not  less than 30 days from the date the notice is given to Borrower, by which the  default must be cured; and (d) that failure to cure the default on or before  the date specified 1n the notice may result in acceleration of the sums secured  by this Security Instrument and sale of the Property. The notice shall further  inform Borrower of the right to reinstate after acceleration and the right to  bring a court action to assert the non-existence of a default or any other  defense of Borrower to acceleration and sale.” (RJN Ex. 102 at p. 13.) (emphasis  added.) Defendant attempts to show there are triable issues of material fact by  stating that the trustee was contractually obligated to give notice of the  default. Defendant further provides nearly identical declarations of her and  her daughter, Ji Hyun Chung where they state that they never received notice.  (Ji Hyun Chung Decl. ¶¶ 13-14; Ji Hong Chung Decl. ¶¶ 13-14.) Nevertheless, the  Court notes Defendant fails to provide any legal authority or sufficient  evidence supporting her arguments for the alleged lack of notice.             A subsequent purchaser from a purchaser at a foreclosure  sale may bring an unlawful detainer to evict.  (Evans v. Superior Court  (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 162, 167-68.)  “Adding the additional requirement  that a subsequent purchaser from the foreclosure sale purchaser prove his own  acquisition of title from said foreclosure sale purchaser no more destroys the  summary nature of the proceedings than does the corresponding requirement that  the landlord's successor in estate prove his acquisition of such interest in a  proceeding pursuant to [CCP § 1161].”  (Id. at 169.)             Essentially, a defendant may challenge a plaintiff’s right  to possession under CCP § 1161(a) by demonstrating noncompliance with Civil  Code § 2924, but any other sort of challenge to the plaintiff’s title does not  constitute a valid defense to an unlawful detainer claim.  (MCA, Inc. v  Universal Diversified Enters. Corp. (1972) 27 Cal.App.3d 170,  176-77.)  For example, a defendant may assert that the foreclosure process  was fraudulent because a forbearance agreement had been reached before the sale  took place.  (Id.)  The defendant would not be challenging the  plaintiff’s ownership of the property, but rather the plaintiff’s right to  initiate unlawful detainer proceedings based on the foreclosure sale.   (See Id.)               Thus, Defendant failed to meet her burden of proof and the  burden does not shift to Plaintiff. Therefore, the Court denies Defendant’s  motion for summary judgment.              IV.     CONCLUSION  AND ORDER            The Court DENIES Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment.             Plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.                        Dated:  September 6, 2024                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      JARED D.

#9470111206204131459345
           The Court takes judicial notice of the documents pursuant
to Evidence Code section 452 (c) and 452 (g).  
 
           C. Merits 
           Plaintiff’s motion seeks possession of the property
located at 3924 Park Place, Unit # 3, 
Montrose, CA 91020 as against all Defendants and occupants because there
is no triable issue of material fact. (Mot. at p. 10.) For the purposes of this
motion only, Plaintiff does not seek money damages.
           The elements for Plaintiff’s case pursuant to CCP section 1161(a)(b)(3)
are: (1) foreclosure in accordance with the CCP and perfection of title; (2) service
of a notice to quit; and (3) Defendants fail to quit and deliver possession.
           In support of its motion, Plaintiff provided the
declaration of the process server, Eric Ratliff, the declaration of Plaintiff’s
custodian of records and books, Olivia Reyes, and various title documents. 
           Foreclosure in Accordance with CCP and Perfection of
Title
           Plaintiff provided sufficient evidence showing that the
foreclosure was in accordance with CCP and perfection of title.  For instance, Plaintiff’s custodian of
records, Olivia Reyes, states “BRECKENRIDGE PROPERTY FUND 2016, LLC was not the
foreclosing beneficiary. BRECKENRIDGE PROPERTY FUND 2016, LLC is a third-party
purchaser, having purchased the property in exchange for money and without any
knowledge or notice of competing claims. Following the sale, BRECKENRIDGE
PROPERTY FUND 2016, LLC received and thereafter recorded the Trustee's Deed
Upon Sale. . ..” (Reyes Decl. ¶ 4; RJN Ex. 1.) Moreover, Plaintiff provided various title documents showing that
it is a bona fide third-party purchaser. Further,
Exhibit 8 shows the substitution of trustee which provides evidence of the
trustee’s authority to conduct the sale. (RJN Ex. 8.) Civil Code section 2934(a) and (d)(4) provides: "[o]nce
recorded, the substitution shall constitute conclusive evidence of the
authority of the substituted trustee or their authorized agents to act pursuant
to this section, unless prompt written notice of resignation of trustee has
been given in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (2).” Thus,
Exhibit 8 constitutes conclusive evidence of the trustee’s authority to conduct
the sale. Additionally, unlike in The
Bank of New York Mellon v. Preciado case, where the Court of Appeal reversed judgment for possession because
plaintiff Bank failed to show that the selling trustee had authority to conduct
the trustee’s sale. (The Bank of New York Mellon v. Preciado (2013) 224
Cal.App.4th Supp. 1, 10.) Here, Preciado is distinguishable from
the instant facts because Plaintiff provided Exhibits 1-8 showing that the
selling trustee was the trustee on the Deed of Trust. (Exhibits in Support, ¶¶
12-14.)
           Thus, Plaintiff has met its burden in showing that the foreclosure was in accordance with
CCP and perfection of title. The burden shifts to Defendant. However, Defendant
failed to file an opposition. Thus, there is no triable issue of material fact
as to this element. 
           Service of A Notice To Quit         
           Plaintiff has met its burden for this element. The process
server who served the notice to quit, Eric Ratliff states “[o]n May 27, 2024,
at approximately 3:30 pm, I proceeded to the premises located at 3924 Park
Place, Unit # 3, Montrose, CA 91020.” On May 30, 2024, at 12:00 midnight, the
Notice to Quit expired by its own terms. (Reyes Decl. ¶ 10.) Additionally,
Plaintiff provided the Proofs of Service for the Notice to Quit. (RJN Nos.
9-10.) Mr. Ratliff further states “I took photographs which are attached as
Exhibit 14 and they accurately depict the premises at the time they were taken.
They show the posing of the notice Ms. Ch[u]ng taking the notice down, the unit
number (3) and the front of the premises from a distance showing the street number
on the building of 3942.” (Ratliff Decl. at ¶ 10.) Therefore, Plaintiff has met
its burden. The burden shifts to Defendant. However, Defendant failed to file
an opposition. Thus, there is no triable issue of material fact as to this
element. 
           Defendants Fail To Quit and Deliver Possession
           Plaintiff has met its burden for this element. The
custodian of records, Olivia Reyes states, “[s]ince 03/21/2024, the premises
has been occupied, used, and enjoyed without the consent or authorization of
Plaintiff. Defendant's title, if any, to said premises, that existed prior to
03/21/2024, was extinguished by said sale.” (Reyes Decl. ¶ 14.) She further
states “Defendant remains in possession of the premises as of the date of this
declaration. Plaintiff anticipates that Defendant will remain in possession of
the premises until removed by court order. If Defendant were to vacate prior to
this hearing, Plaintiff will submit a supplemental declaration informing the
court of Defendant's vacation.” (Id. at ¶ 15.) Therefore, Plaintiff has
met its burden. The burden shifts to Defendant. However, Defendant failed to
file an opposition. Thus, there is no triable issue of material fact as to this
element.
