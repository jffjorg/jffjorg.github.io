```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Honda's motion for a protective order to quash deposition notices served on two of its employees, Michelle Jongkind and Carol Chin. Honda had argued that the deponents did not have personal knowledge of the alleged defects in the Honda Sensing system and that the depositions would cause undue burden and expense. However, the judge has found that Honda has failed to meet its burden of establishing good cause for the quash. The judge has ordered that the deposition notices be allowed to proceed, as the deponents have been involved in reporting and investigating defects in the Honda Sensing system and have authored documents that are relevant to the case.
