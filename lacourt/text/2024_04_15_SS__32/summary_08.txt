And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has granted the defendant's motion to dismiss the plaintiff's complaint with prejudice. The plaintiff filed the original complaint on September 28, 2022, and the defendant demurred to the complaint on November 16, 2023. The plaintiff was granted leave to amend the complaint, but failed to do so within the time allowed by the court. The plaintiff was instructed to file a motion for leave to amend the complaint, but no such motion was filed. As a result, the Court has construed the plaintiff's failure to amend as an admission that the plaintiff cannot state a cause of action and has dismissed the complaint with prejudice.
