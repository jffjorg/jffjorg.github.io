And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling addresses the motion by Plaintiff Silvia Pena to deem admitted matters in the Requests for Admissions, Set One, served on Defendant Chedraui USA, Inc. dba "El Super". The Defendant has failed to respond to the requests for admission. The Court finds that the Defendant's failure to respond was due to a calendaring error and does not justify the waiver of objections. However, the Court does not grant the Defendant's request for relief from waiver of objections. The Court conditionally grants the Plaintiff's motion and orders the Defendant to pay $1,050 in monetary sanctions to the Plaintiff's counsel. The Defendant shall serve responses in substantial compliance with section 2033.220 before the hearing.
