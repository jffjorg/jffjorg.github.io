BACKGROUND
 
On September 28, 2022, Plaintiff Ana Olascoaga Aviles (“Plaintiff”)
filed a form complaint against Defendants Los Angeles County Metropolitan
Transportation Authority and Does 1 to 50 for negligence surrounding a motor
vehicle accident.
 
On November 16, 2023, the Court sustained Defendant Los Angeles County
Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s (“Defendant”) demurrer to the complaint
with leave to amend within 30 days. (Min. Order, 11/16/23.) According to the
proof of service filed on November 16, 2023, Defendant served electronic notice
of the ruling on November 16, 2023.
 
On December 26, 2023, Plaintiff filed her first amended complaint
(“FAC”).
 
On February 1, 2024, the Court sustained Defendant’s demurrer to the
FAC finding that the FAC again failed to identify a specific statutory duty
that was breached. (Min. Order, 2/1/24.) Defendant also argued that the FAC was
filed past the Court’s deadline in the November 16, 2023 minute order. At the
hearing, Plaintiff appeared claiming to have filed a second amended complaint,
but no such filing existed on the docket. The Court then instructed: “To the
extent Plaintiff seeks leave to amend the complaint, Plaintiff must file a
proper motion. To the extent that Defendant seeks a dismissal of the complaint
due to Plaintiff’s late filing of the FAC, Defendant must file a motion.” (Min.
Order, 2/1/24.) 
 
Defendant now moves to dismiss Plaintiff’s complaint under Code of
Civil Procedure section 581(f)(2). No opposition has been filed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 581(f)(2) states: “The
court may dismiss the complaint as to that defendant when: … (2) Except where
Section 597 applies, after a demurrer to the complaint is sustained with leave
to amend, the plaintiff fails to amend it within the time allowed by the court
and either party moves for dismissal.” If a plaintiff fails to amend after the
court has sustained a demurrer, the court may construe the failure to amend as
an admission that the plaintiff cannot cure the defects that the court
identified and dismiss the plaintiff's complaint.  (Cano v. Glover
(2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 326, 330 [reversing trial court order dismissing without
prejudice, and ordering dismissal with prejudice after plaintiff amended
complaint four times but failed to state a cause of action].) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Here, Plaintiff was granted leave to amend her complaint within 30
days. (Min. Order, 11/16/23.) Defendant served electronic notice of the order
on November 16, 2023. Therefore, 30 days after was December 16, 2023. Since
notice was provided electronically, the deadline was extended by two court
days. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 1010.6(a)(3)(B).) Therefore, Plaintiff’s amended
complaint was due December 19, 2023. Because Plaintiff filed her FAC on
December 26, 2023, it was late.
 
On February 1, 2024, the Court sustained Defendant’s demurrer to the
FAC. Plaintiff was instructed to file a motion for leave to amend the
complaint. No such motion has been filed.
 
Plaintiff has received notice of this motion by mail and has not filed
an opposition. Therefore, because Plaintiff failed to amend in time, the motion
to dismiss as to moving defendant is granted. Moreover, the only other
defendants are Does 1 through 50, who remain unnamed and unserved since the
complaint was filed on September 28, 2022. Accordingly, the Court dismisses the
entirety of the complaint.
 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS Defendant Los Angeles County
Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s motion to dismiss. The action is
dismissed with prejudice and all dates are advanced and vacated. 
 
Defendant shall provide notice
and file a proof of service of such.
