And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, La Verne-Live Oak Homeowners Association, moves for summary judgment to dismiss the plaintiff's claim for negligence and premises liability. The plaintiff was bitten by a dog on September 23, 2020, while walking in a public area of the La Verne Live Oak Community. The defendant argues that it had no actual knowledge of the dog's dangerous propensities and therefore owes no duty to the plaintiff.

The court finds that the defendant has met its burden of establishing that it had no actual knowledge of the dog's dangerous propensities. The plaintiff's evidence consists of testimony about the dog's barking and jumping on the fence, but this does not establish actual knowledge of the dog's vicious nature. The court also finds that the plaintiff has failed to establish a triable issue of fact and therefore grants the defendant's motion for summary judgment.
