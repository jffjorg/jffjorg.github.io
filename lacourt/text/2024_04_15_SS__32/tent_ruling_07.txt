TENTATIVE
RULING
 



DEPT:


32




HEARING DATE:


April
  15, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


22STCV25066




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  to Deem Admitted




MOVING PARTY:


Plaintiff Silvia Pena 




OPPOSING PARTY:


Defendant
  Chedraui USA, Inc. 



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
            Plaintiff Silvia Pena (Plaintiff)
moves to deem admitted matters in the Requests for Admissions, Set One served
on Defendant Chedraui USA, Inc. dba “El Super” (Defendant). Plaintiff seeks
monetary sanctions. Defendant opposes. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Where
there has been no timely response to a request for admission under Code of
Civil Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may move for an order
that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in
the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction. 
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)  The party who failed to
respond waives any objections to the demand, unless the court grants that party
relief from the waiver, upon a showing that the party (1) has subsequently
served a substantially compliant response, and (2) that the party’s failure to
respond was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subds. (a)(1)-(2).)  The court “shall”
grant a motion to deem admitted requests for admissions, “unless it finds that
the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served,
before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for
admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code
of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
 
The
Discovery Act does not define “substantial compliance” in the context of
service of a proposed response that complies with Code Civ. Proc., section
2033.220. The courts have ruled that “substantial compliance” means actual
compliance with all matters of substance and that technical deviations are not
to be given the stature of noncompliance. (St. Mary v. Superior Court
(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 779.) For example, unverified responses are not in
substantial compliance. (Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206
Cal.App.3d 632, 636.) Additionally, RFA responses must be examined in their
entirety. (St. Mary v. Superior Court (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 780.) 
 
Unverified
discovery responses are tantamount to no response at all, and are subject to a
motion to compel responses (rather than a motion to compel further responses).¿
(Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal. App. 3d 632, 635-36.)¿
However, objections to discovery responses do not require a verification. (See Food 4 Less Supermarkets, Inc. v. Superior Court (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 651, 656.) 
 
Where
a party fails to provide a timely response to requests for admission, “[i]t is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
 
DISCUSSION
 
Here, Plaintiff asserts that she served Requests for Admissions, Set One
on Defendant on June 23, 2023. (Gabrielyan Decl. ¶ 4, Exh. 1.) As of the date
of filing this motion, Defendant has not served responses. (Id. ¶ 7.) 
 
In opposition, Defendant argues the motion should be denied because it
intends to serve responses in substantial compliance before the hearing.
Defendant also asks for relief from waiver of the objections since it argues
that the late responses were due to a calendaring error from Defendant’s
counsel’s secretary. (Opposition at p. 3.)  
 
First, section 2033.280(a) states that “[t]he court, on motion,
may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the
following conditions are satisfied:
 
(1) The party has subsequently served a response that is in
substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230.
(2) The party's failure to serve a timely response was the result of
mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(a) [emphasis added].) 
 
Here, Defendant did not separately move for relief prior to this
motion. The Court will not hear Defendant’s motion as an opposition brief. 
 
Second, Defendant must show at the hearing that it served responses in
substantial compliance with section 2033.220.  
 
Despite Defendant’s
argument that monetary sanctions should not be awarded, sanctions
are mandatory. Plaintiff requests $2,560 in monetary sanctions representing an
hourly rate of $500 and the $60 filing fee. However, given the type of motion,
and the fact counsel can appear remotely at the hearing, the Court finds this
amount is excessive and reduces it to $1,050 (2 hours of attorney time plus the
$60 filing fee). 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Deem Admitted Request for
Admissions, Set One, is conditionally granted.  
 
The Court further orders monetary sanctions against Defendant in the reduced
amount of $1,050. Said monetary sanctions are to be paid to counsel for Plaintiff
within 30 days of the date of this order.
 
Plaintiff
shall provide notice of the Court’s order and file a proof of
service of such.
