Plaintiff appears to dispute Defendant’s characterization (through the
Declaration of Robin Carder) that all community complaints were recorded in the
Board’s minutes and collected by Haven Management. (Compare Pl. Exh C,
Gump Depo. 49:12–51:17, with Carder Decl. ¶ 3.) However, Robin Carder
declared under penalty of perjury that she prepared for her declaration by
reviewing “the business records of the HOA, including the Board minutes, as
well as business records generated by Haven Management that were provided to
the HOA.” (Carder Decl. ¶ 4.) Therefore, the dispute of how complaints were
brought to Defendant’s attention does not discredit Carder’s testimony that
Defendant received no complaints about the subject dog prior to the incident.
Therefore, Defendant has still met its initial burden and Plaintiff has not
provided evidence of past complaints about the dog.
