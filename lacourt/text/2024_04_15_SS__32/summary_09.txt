The Plaintiff seeks to compel further responses from the Defendant and also requests monetary sanctions. However, the Court finds that the motion is procedurally defective due to the Plaintiff's failure to engage in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) and to file an IDC statement with the Court. As a result, the Court denies the motion to compel further responses and also denies the Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions. The Court orders the Plaintiff to provide notice of the Court's orders and to file a proof of service of such.
