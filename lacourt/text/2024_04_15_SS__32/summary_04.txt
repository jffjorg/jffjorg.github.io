And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the petition filed by Jesus Sanchez to approve the compromise of the pending action of his daughter, Jayleen Sanchez, who was involved in a rear-end motor vehicle accident and experienced neck and back pain. The judge denies the petition without prejudice for several reasons, including the lack of recent medical records to confirm Jayleen's full recovery from her injuries. The judge also notes that the proposed order contains errors, including incorrect values and formatting issues. The judge orders Jesus Sanchez to provide a recent medical record or report confirming Jayleen's full recovery and to correct the proposed order.
