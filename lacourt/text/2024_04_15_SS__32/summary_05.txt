And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denies the defendant's motion for leave to conduct a mental examination of the plaintiff, citing procedural defects in the motion. The defendant, The Vons Company, Inc., sought to conduct a mental examination of the plaintiff, Trenna Jones, to obtain evidence of her alleged ongoing mental and physical injuries resulting from a slip and fall. The judge notes that the defendant's motion did not specify the specific tests that would be used in the examination, as required by California law. The judge also notes that the defendant made a good faith attempt to meet and confer with the plaintiff's counsel, but was unsuccessful due to a breakdown in communication. The judge concludes that the defendant has not shown good cause for the mental examination and denies the motion.
