  Case Number:  18STCV09595    Hearing Date:   March 6, 2024    Dept:  I The court has some issues regarding the potential default judgment.  The court wants to be sure that the numbers add up and there is no double counting for past actuals.  "Adjustments" to the bill are not recoverable.  Only what the carrier paid plus what the plaintiff paid out of pocket.  For futures, the court notes the number is high, but it is supported with an expert declaration that appears to be sufficient for these purposes.  However, that still does not get to the amount requested as actual damages, which is about $5.7 million.  The court needs to see how that number was calculated.  The court does not believe it can give any punitive damages here because there is no showing of defendant's financial condition and to the extent any implied showing is there, it suggests that defendant stands on bankruptcy's door.  Finally, there is no indication as to how the settlement is being apportioned.  The court would think that there is a dollar for dollar reduction in the amount of the default judgment based on the settlement with the other defendants.That needs to be addressed in the next motion.
