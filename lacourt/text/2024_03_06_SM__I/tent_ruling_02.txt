 Case Number:  20SMCV01887    Hearing Date:   March 6, 2024    Dept:  I The unopposed motions to compel are GRANTED.  The request for sanctions is GRANTED  in the amount of $3010 jointly against
defendants (but not counsel). 
These are motions to compel compliance to written discovery
responses.  Defendants stated that they
would produce “all documents within Responding Party’s possession, custody, and
control” but as of the date the motion was filed (November 20, 2023) defendant
had not done so.  That is far too
long.  Documents will be produced within
5 court days in a Code-compliant manner. 
A verification that all responsive documents have been produced will
accompany the documents.  If some
responsive documents cannot be produced, or if there are no responsive
documents as to some categories, a further verified response complying with CCP
section 2031.230 will be provided.  There
is no excuse for defendants’ failure to provide these documents.  The sanction request is therefore
appropriate.  However, because there was
no opposition, the time anticipated to review the opposition and file a reply
is taken out.  The remainder is $3010 for
the two motions combined.  The motions
are essentially identical, and the court will not double count.
