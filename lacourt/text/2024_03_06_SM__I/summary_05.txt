And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to disqualify defense counsel in a case against various members of a Homeowners Association (HOA) board and contractors. The court has previously sustained a demurrer to an earlier version of the complaint due to unclear causes of action. Leave to amend was granted, and a new version of the complaint is pending. The court notes that if the new complaint is derivative in nature, there may be a conflict of interest due to defense counsel representing both the HOA and the alleged wrongdoers. However, the court does not believe that plaintiffs have made a sufficient showing to require defense counsel's removal from the case entirely. Instead, the court suggests that the HOA retain separate counsel if the new complaint is derivative, and that no further legal action be taken while the conflict remains.
