And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the unopposed motions to compel compliance to written discovery responses and the request for sanctions. The defendants were required to produce all responsive documents, but failed to do so despite stating they would. The court has ordered the defendants to produce the documents within 5 court days in a Code-compliant manner, accompanied by a verification that all responsive documents have been produced. If some responsive documents cannot be produced, the defendants must provide a further verified response complying with CCP section 2031.230. The court has imposed a sanction of $3010 jointly against the defendants, but not their counsel, for their failure to comply with the discovery requests.
