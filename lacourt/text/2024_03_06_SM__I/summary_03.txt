And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses a demurrer by Corby and Corby, an accountancy corporation (C&C), to a cross-complaint filed by Barry Maiten (Maiten). The demurrer argues that Maiten's pleading fails to state sufficient facts and is uncertain. The court finds that the demurrer for uncertainty is unsubstantiated and overrules it. The court also finds that Maiten has properly alleged a claim for breach of fiduciary duty, which is based on allegations of professional negligence by C&C. The court notes that C&C did not raise the statute of limitations in its moving papers and therefore does not address Maiten's argument on that point. The motion to strike is denied as unsubstantiated. C&C is given 30 days to answer the cross-complaint.
