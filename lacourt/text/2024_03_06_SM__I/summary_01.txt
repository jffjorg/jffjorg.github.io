And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a potential default judgment. The judge is concerned about the calculation of actual damages, which totals $5.7 million. The judge requires further explanation on how this amount was arrived at. Additionally, the judge does not believe punitive damages are allowable, as there is no evidence of the defendant's financial condition and the possibility of bankruptcy is raised. The judge also notes that "adjustments" to the bill are not recoverable and that only what the carrier paid plus what the plaintiff paid out of pocket is recoverable. Furthermore, the judge wants to know how the settlement with other defendants will be apportioned and suggests that there should be a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the amount of the default judgment based on the settlement. The judge has requested that these issues be addressed in the next motion.
