And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted a stipulation to continue a motion to March 22, 2024. In the meantime, the parties are encouraged to discuss resolving the issue. The judge agrees that Montano is entitled to know that no one, including a third party, reviews privileged materials. However, the judge is concerned that the current document request is too broad and may capture many documents that are not relevant to the case. The judge suggests that the parties could agree to use specific search terms or meta-data to limit the scope of the document request. Alternatively, the plaintiff could serve a new set of discovery requests that are more carefully worded to avoid ambiguity. The judge is unlikely to allow a third-party vendor to have free access to Montano's email accounts, but may consider alternative ways to produce the relevant documents.
