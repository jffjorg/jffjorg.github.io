And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer and motion to strike. The demurrer is overruled, and the motion to strike is denied. The plaintiff alleges fraud, claiming that the defendant took a $160,000 deposit without intending to manufacture the custom alloy tubes. The defendant claimed production delays, but an inspection of their facilities revealed that they had no manufacturing plants. The defendant cancelled the orders and offered to return the deposit, but only if the plaintiff signed a general release. The judge found that the plaintiff's allegations of fraud are sufficient to support a claim, and therefore, the demurrer is overruled. The judge also denied the motion to strike punitive damages. The defendant has 5 court days to answer.
