Summary in English:

The tentative ruling addresses Plaintiff Gabriel Fajardo's motions for reconsideration and new trial related to the employment discrimination case against the City of Los Angeles (Defendant). The Court granted the Defendant's JNOV motion, which led to the dismissal of the Plaintiff's claims. The Plaintiff argues that the Defendant raised new arguments in its reply brief that were not considered by the Court, and that the Defendant waived its right to challenge the verdict. However, the Court finds that these arguments are not new facts or law and do not warrant reconsideration. The Court also denies the Plaintiff's request for a new trial, finding that the inconsistent verdict is a legitimate basis for a new trial, but only when the verdict does not include an essential predicate to impose liability against the defendant. In this case, the verdict on the failure to prevent claim is at odds with the verdict against the Plaintiff on the underlying harassment, discrimination, and retaliation claims, and the Court finds that JNOV is the appropriate remedy.
