And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by defendants Steve and Shlomo Rechnitz. The case involves a commercial lease dispute between the Rothstein Family Trust and the defendants. The defendants demurred to and moved to strike portions of the complaint, arguing that the plaintiffs have misjoined the parties and failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.

The judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the complaint states a claim. The judge has also denied the motion to strike, finding that the claims are not time-barred and that the defendants' arguments are misplaced.

The judge has granted the defendants' request for judicial notice of a Certificate of Dissolution filed with the California Secretary of State. The judge has also denied the defendants' request for judicial notice of other exhibits.

The judge has given the defendants twenty days to answer the complaint. The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change after further briefing and argument.
