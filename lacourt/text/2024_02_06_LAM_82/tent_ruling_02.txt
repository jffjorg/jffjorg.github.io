[TENTATIVE] RULING ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF PROHIBITION,
  MANDAMUS, OR OTHER APPROPRIATE RELIEF AND DECLARATORY RELIEF
 
Dept. 82 (Hon. Curtis A. Kin)
 
 




 


 


 


 



Petitioner
El Rovia Mobile Home Park, LLC petitions for a writ of prohibition and writ of
mandate enjoining respondent City of El Monte from processing, scheduling, or
re-adjudicating an appeal of petitioner’s fair return application for approval
of a rent increase, which was granted by respondent’s City Manager for the 2019
calendar year. 
 
I.       Factual Background
 
Petitioner
El Rovia Mobile Home Park, LLC does business as a mobilehome park named El
Rovia Mobile Home Park (“Park”). Respondent City of El Monte (“City”) has a
rent control ordinance, Ordinance No. 2860 (“Ordinance”), that governs rent
increases for the Park. (AR 1-23.) The Ordinance provides for (1) annual rent
increases and (2) other permitted rent increases (i.e., “fair return”) by
application determined by the City Manager, pursuant to § 8.70.080. (AR 1-23.) 
 
Sections
8.70.140 of the Ordinance states that the residents of each mobilehome park[1]
shall elect a “resident representative” for their mobilehome park to receive
all notices required under the Ordinance. (AR
20.) There was no resident representative selected by the residents of Park
with respect to all times relevant to the Application for the year 2019. (See
Intervenor’s Opp. at 3.)
 
On
September 17, 2020, petitioner submitted its fair return application (“Application”)
to the City for the 2019 calendar year. (AR 57-85.) On July 27, 2021, after
supplemental disclosures by petitioner as requested by the City (AR 86-627),
the City determined the Application was complete. (AR 628.) The residents had
twenty (20) days to provide a response to the Application and the City would
render its decision within sixty (60) days. (AR 628.) On July 29, 2021, the
City sent each resident a notice requesting any comments on the Application.
(AR 999.) On August 16, 2021, Neighborhood Legal Services (“NLS”) sent to the
City Manager a letter, which stated that NLS represented Park resident Franklin
Stooksberry in space No. 72 “and the El Rovia Mobilehome Park Tenants Association/Affected
Tenants” and that they opposed the Application. (AR 646-833.) On August 25,
2021, another letter from NLS was sent to the City Manager opposing the
Application. (AR 834-44.)
 
On
September 23, 2021, the City Manager issued its decision on the Application.
(AR 629-45.) The City Manager approved the rent adjustments requested by
petitioner. (AR 629.) No resident representative was indicated as having been
sent this decision. (AR 629.) The Park or the residents had twenty (20) days
after September 23, 2021, to appeal the decision. (AR 629.) On October 4, 2021,
NLS sent a letter indicating a majority of the affected residents (10 of 16)
appealed the City Manager decision. (AR 878-79.)
 
            On August 1, 2022, counsel for petitioner
sent the City its legal arguments in support of this writ proceeding and demanded
the City not allow the appeal to proceed. (AR 971-78) The City is proceeding
with appellate proceedings. (AR 1000.)
 
II.      Procedural History
 
            On
February 9, 2023, petitioner filed a Verified Petition for Writ of Prohibition,
Mandamus, or Other Appropriate Relief and Declaratory Relief. On March 15,
2023, respondent City of El Monte filed an Answer. On December 22, 2023, as
stipulated by the parties, the Court granted Franklin Stooksberry’s motion for leave
to intervene. On the same date, Stooksberry filed an Answer. 
 
            On
December 22, 2023, petitioner filed an opening brief. On January 12, 2024,
intervenor Stooksberry filed an opposition. On January 22, 2024, petitioner
filed a reply.[2]
 
III.     Standard of Review
 
CCP
§ 1085(a) provides: “A writ of mandate may be issued by any court to any
inferior tribunal, corporation, board, or person, to compel the performance of
an act which the law specially enjoins, as a duty resulting from an office,
trust, or station, or to compel the admission of a party to the use and
enjoyment of a right or office to which the party is entitled, and from which
the party is unlawfully precluded by that inferior tribunal, corporation,
board, or person.”
 
“There
are two essential requirements to the issuance of a traditional writ of
mandate: (1) a clear, present and usually ministerial duty on the part of the
respondent, and (2) a clear, present and beneficial right on the part of the
petitioner to the performance of that duty.” (California Assn. for Health
Services at Home v. State Dept. of Health Services (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
696, 704.) “An action in ordinary mandamus is proper where…the claim is that an
agency has failed to act as required by law.” (Id. at 705.)
 
“When
a party seeks review of an administrative decision pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 1085, judicial review is limited to examining the agency
proceedings to ascertain whether the agency's action has been arbitrary,
capricious or lacking entirely in evidentiary support, or whether the agency
failed to follow the proper procedure and give notices required by law. And,
where the case involves the interpretation of a statute or ordinance, our
review of the trial court's decision is de novo.” (Ideal Boat & Camper
Storage v. County of Alameda (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 301, 311, citing Pomona
Police Officers' Assn. v. City of Pomona (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 578, 584.)
In independently reviewing legal questions, “An administrative agency's
interpretation does not bind judicial review but it is entitled to
consideration and respect.” (Housing Partners I, Inc. v. Duncan (2012)
206 Cal.App.4th 1335, 1343.) 
 
An
agency is presumed to have regularly performed its official duties. (Evid. Code
§ 664.) In a CCP § 1085 writ petition, the petitioner generally bears the
burden of proof. (California Correctional Peace Officers Assn. v. State
Personnel Bd. (1995) 10 Cal.4th 1133, 1154.)         
 
            Petitioner also seeks a writ of prohibition. “The writ of
prohibition arrests the proceedings of any tribunal, corporation, board, or
person exercising judicial functions, when such proceedings are without or in
excess of the jurisdiction of such tribunal, corporation, board, or person.”
(CCP § 1102.) “A writ of prohibition may be issued by any court to an inferior
tribunal or to a corporation, board, or person, in all cases where there is not
a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.” (CCP §
1103(a).) 
 
IV.     Analysis
 
            Petitioner contends that, because
the residents of the Park had not appointed a “resident representative” in
accordance with section 8.70.140 of the Ordinance for the 2019 calendar year,
the residents of the Park do not have jurisdiction or standing to appeal the
City Manager’s decision concerning petitioner’s 2019 fair return application.  Section 8.70.140 states:
 
The
residents of each mobilehome park in the City shall annually elect by majority
vote, with one vote per space, a resident representative to receive all notices
required by this Chapter. The residents shall advise the City Manager of the
name, address and phone number of the elected resident representative in writing
no later than January 31st of each year and shall promptly notify the City Manager
of any change of representative.
 
(AR
20.) It is undisputed that no resident representative was appointed. 
 
            Section 8.70.090 of the Ordinance sets
forth the procedures governing a mobilepark owner’s petition for approval of a
rent adjustment to obtain a fair return. Subdivisions (A), (B), and (C) govern
the owner’s submission of a fair return application. (AR 13.) Subdivision (D)(1)
requires the City Manager to decide the application within 60 days of
completion of the application. (AR 14.) Subdivision (D)(1) states the decision
“shall be emailed and sent by mail, with proof of mailing to the park owner,
the park owner’s designated representative for the petition, and a designated
representative of the residents.” (AR 14.) 
 
            Subdivision (D)(2) allows for the
City Manager’s decision to be appealed: 
 
The
decision of the City Manager may be appealed within twenty (20) calendar days
to a hearing officer. An appeal by the mobilehome owner tenants must be signed
by residents from a majority of the mobilehome spaces that are subject to the
City Manager’s decision. The appealing party shall be required to pay for costs
of the appeal process in accordance with any fees set forth by resolution of
the City Council.
 
(AR
15.) Subdivision (D)(2) does not state that only the “resident representative”
or “designated representative” can appeal the City Manager’s decision. Subdivision
(D)(2) only provides that a majority of the tenants whose spaces are affected
by the City Manager’s decision must sign the appeal. Here, it is undisputed
that a majority—10 of 16 tenants—signed the appeal. (AR 878-79.)  
 
            Section 8.70.090(D)(2) is abundantly
clear that residents of the Park who are affected by a City Manager’s decision
on a fair return application have the right to appeal, so long as a majority of
the affected residents sign the appeal. 
There is nothing about the language of section 8.70.090 to suggest that
having a designated representative for the purpose of receiving notice is a
necessary prerequisite for exercising the right to appeal.  
 
Despite
any logical connection between the Ordinance’s provisions for notice and the
right to appeal, petitioner goes so far as to argue the residents did “forgo
and waive” their right to appeal and opted to entrust the City with protecting
them from unlawful rent increases when they failed to select a designated
resident to receive notices.  (Opening
Br. at 8.)  In addition to lacking any support
from the language of the notice and right to appeal provisions in the
Ordinance, petitioner’s contention actually contravenes an explicit provision
of the Ordinance concerning the waiver of rights.  Section 8.70.120 states: “Any waiver or
purported waiver by a mobilehome owner or mobilehome tenant of rights granted
under this Chapter shall be void as contrary to public policy.” (AR 20.)
 
            Further, the notice provisions of
the Ordinance are more logically viewed as furthering the rights of residents,
not providing an illogical impediment to the exercise of those rights.  Requiring residents potentially affected by adverse
actions of the City provides a protection that ensures residents have
information so they may decide whether to exercise their rights and take action.  To the extent residents fail to select a
“resident representative” (section 8.70.140) or “designated representative”
(section 8.70.090(D)),[3]
they may not receive the benefit of the notice provisions and, for example,
cannot later be heard to complain insofar as they do not timely take action. (See
Section 8.70.090(D)(2) [requiring appeal of City Manager’s decision within 20
calendar days].)  But there is simply no
basis to conclude that the residents’ failure to take advantage of the
Ordinance notice provisions somehow divested them of unrelated rights,
including the right to appeal.[4]

V.      Conclusion
 
For
the foregoing reasons, respondent may adjudicate the appeal of the residents of
the City Manager’s decision on petitioner’s fair return application. The first
cause of action for Writ of Prohibition or Other Appropriate Relief is
DENIED.  With respect to the second cause
of action for declaratory relief, petitioner seeks a declaration that no appeal
may be taken from the City Manager’s decision. (Pet. Prayer at 11:10-11.) For
the reasons stated above, petitioner is not entitled to such a declaration. The
second cause of action for Declaratory Relief is DENIED.
 
Accordingly, the Verified Petition for Writ of
Prohibition, Mandamus, or Other Appropriate Relief and Declaratory Relief is DENIED
in its entirety. Pursuant to Local Rule 3.231(n), respondent City of El Monte shall
prepare, serve, and ultimately file a proposed judgment.
