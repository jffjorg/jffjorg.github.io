Here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants Receiver Theodore Lanes' motion to terminate the receivership and approve his final report and accounting. The Receiver has been working to recover assets and settle debts since the receivership was appointed on April 25, 2023. The Receiver was unable to recover funds from accounts receivable and customer files, but did recover $14,000 from the sale of two automobiles. The Receiver is seeking reimbursement of administrative expenses in the amount of $2,210.00. The court will exonerate the Receiver's bond and discharge the Receiver. The preliminary injunction imposed by the Appointment Order is dissolved. However, the court will not exonerate the plaintiff's undertaking related to the preliminary injunction, pending further argument at the hearing.
