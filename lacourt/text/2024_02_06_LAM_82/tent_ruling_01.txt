Case:                           Cynthia Mabus v. Culver
City et al. (21STCP04028)
 
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Petitioner Cynthia Mabus’ Motion for Relief from Denial of
Motion for Attorney Fees on the Grounds of Untimely Filing Pursuant to CCP
473(b) is DENIED.
 
Pursuant to CCP § 473(b), petitioner Cynthia Mabus moves for
relief from the Court’s denial of petitioner’s motion for attorney fees based
on mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. 
 
However, defendant sought the same relief in the ex parte
application to extend the deadline for filing a motion for attorney fees heard
on August 10, 2023. (McEwen Decl. ¶ 24 & Ex. E.) Petitioner sought relief
from the untimely filing of the fee motion under Rule of Court 3.1702(d) and
CCP § 473(b) on the ground that counsel did not know that CCP § 1013(a) did not
operate to extend the time to file a notice of appeal in the event of service
by mail. (McEwen Decl. ¶ 24 & Ex. E at Notice at 1:25-2:4; Points and
Authorities at 1:24-2:2, 7:19-27, 9:26-10:2.) 
 
On August 10, 2023, the Court denied petitioner’s ex parte
application. (McEwen Decl. ¶ 26 & Ex. A to Ex. F.) The Court acknowledged
petitioner sought an extension of time to file a motion for attorneys’ fees
pursuant to both Rule of Court 3.1702(d) and CCP § 473. With respect to Rule of
Court 3.1702(d), the Court explained that it may extend the time for filing a
motion for attorney fees for “good cause.” With respect to CCP § 473(b), the
Court stated that it had more latitude to find good cause under Rule of Court
3.1702(d) than granting relief under CCP § 473(b). The Court then
concluded: “Given the clear and unambiguous language concerning the
inapplicability of CCP § 1013(a) to the time to file a notice of appeal (and
thus the instant fee motion), this Court cannot find that the issue of
timeliness was either complex or debatable. As such, this Court does not find
that petitioner's counsel made an honest mistake of law to support a finding of
good cause or excusable neglect.” By reference to excusable neglect, as well as
having stated that good cause was a more lenient standard that the standard
under CCP § 473(b), the Court necessarily found that petitioner was not entitled
to relief under CCP § 473(b). 
 
In the instant motion, petitioner, by way of counsel,
presents the same argument of mistake and again invokes CCP § 473(b). (Notice
of Motion at 1:27-2:2; Points and Authorities at 2:5-13, 10:13-16; Sunukjian
Decl. ¶ 20 [counsel had not known that CCP § 1013 did not extend time to file
notice of appeal].) 
 
“The name of a motion is not controlling, and, regardless of
the name, a motion asking the trial court to decide the same matter previously
ruled on is a motion for reconsideration under Code of Civil Procedure section
1008.” (Powell v. County of Orange (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 1573,
1577.) Because petitioner asks the Court to decide whether, pursuant to CCP §
473(b), she is entitled to relief from the Court’s previous finding that the
fee motion was untimely—the same matter on which the Court ruled on August 10,
2023—the Court deems this motion a motion for reconsideration under CCP §
1008(a). 
 
The purpose of CCP § 1008 is “to conserve judicial resources
by constraining litigants who would endlessly bring the same motions over and
over, or move for reconsideration of every adverse order and then appeal the
denial of the motion to reconsider.” (Even Zohar Construction &
Remodeling, Inc. v. Bellaire Townhouses, LLC (2015) 61 Cal.4th 830, 839–40,
internal quotations omitted.) 
 
“When an
application for an order has been made to a judge, or to a court, and refused
in whole or in part, or granted, or granted conditionally, or on terms, any
party affected by the order may, within 10 days after service upon the party of
written notice of entry of the order and based upon new or different facts,
circumstances, or law, make application to the same judge or court that made
the order, to reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior
order.” (CCP § 1008(a).) When a party requests reconsideration, the
deadline set forth in CCP § 1008(a) is jurisdictional. (Morite of California v. Superior Court (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 485, 490; Kerns v. CSE Ins. Group (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 368, 391 [“[W]e hold
that the procedural prerequisites set forth for reconsideration of orders and
renewal of motions previously denied are jurisdictional as applied to the
actions of parties to civil litigation.”].) 

 
Here, petitioner’s prior ex parte application for CCP §
473(b) relief was denied on August 10, 2023. Petitioner waived notice. (8/10/23
Minute Order; CCP § 1019.5 [“When a motion is granted or denied, unless the
court otherwise orders, notice of the court’s decision or order shall be given
by the prevailing party to all other parties or their attorneys . . . unless
notice is waived by all parties in open court and is entered in the minutes”].)
Accordingly, petitioner had 10 days from August 10, 2023, or August 21, 2023
(since August 20, 2023 was a Sunday) to file a motion for reconsideration. This
motion was untimely filed on December 7, 2023. 
 
Further, a party moving for reconsideration of a prior
ruling “must provide a satisfactory explanation for the failure to produce the
evidence at an earlier time.” (New York Times Co. v. Superior Court
(2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 206, 212.) Here, petitioner does not present any new
facts, circumstances, or law upon which she files the instant motion. Indeed,
petitioner presents the same arguments that were presented and rejected in the
previously denied ex parte application. 
 
CCP § 1008(b) allows a party to file a renewed motion “upon
new or different facts, circumstances, or law, in which case it shall be shown
by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge, what
order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances,
or law are claimed to be shown.” (CCP § 1008(b).) A renewed motion is not
subject to a 10-day filing deadline. Even if petitioner could avail herself of
CCP § 1008(b), the supporting affidavit must show “what ‘new or different
facts, circumstances, or law are claimed’ [citation] to justify the renewed
application, and show diligence with a satisfactory explanation for not
presenting the new or different information earlier.” (Even Zohar, 61
Cal.4th at 833, citing CCP § 1008(b).) As stated above, petitioner does not
present any new facts or law to warrant the filing of a renewed motion. Accordingly,
the Court does not have jurisdiction under CCP § 1008(b) to reconsider the denial
of extension of time to file a fee motion. (See CCP § 1008(e)
[“This section specifies the court’s jurisdiction with regard to applications
for reconsideration of its orders and renewals of previous motions, and applies
to all applications to reconsider any order of a judge or court, or for the
renewal of a previous motion, whether the order deciding the previous matter or
motion is interim or final”].) Even if the Court had jurisdiction to hear a
renewed motion, whether to grant reconsideration would still be within the
Court’s discretion. (Film Packages, Inc. v. Brandywine Film Productions,
Ltd. (1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 824, 830.) Because petitioner’s counsel does not
provide any new reasons why the mistake to not consider the entirety of CCP §
1013(a) was excusable, the Court would decline to exercise such discretion for
the same reasons stated in the August 10, 2023 ruling. 
 
Citing Ron Burns Construction Co., Inc. v. Moore (2010)
184 Cal.App.4th 1406, petitioner argues that a motion that satisfies CCP § 473
cannot be barred under CCP § 1008. In Ron Burns, the plaintiff filed an
ex parte application for an order finding that a motion for attorney fees was
still timely. (Ron Burns, 184 Cal.App.4th at 1412.) The trial court denied
the ex parte application, finding that the issue of timeliness could be
addressed in a formal, noticed motion. (Ibid.) The plaintiff
subsequently filed a motion for attorney fees and incorporated the ex parte
application by reference. (Ibid.) The trial court denied the motion as
untimely. (Ibid.) The plaintiff subsequently found a motion for relief
from default under CCP § 473. (Ibid.) The trial court ruled that the
motion under CCP § 473 was an improper attempt to circumvent CCP § 1008. (Ibid.)
 
 
The Court of Appeal found that the plaintiff’s mistake that
caused the fee motion to be denied as untimely was excusable neglect as a
matter of law. (Ron Burns, 184 Cal.App.4th at 1416.) Citing Standard
Microsystems Corp. v. Winbond Electronics Corp. (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 868,
the Court of Appeal in Ron Burns then found that the subsequent motion
under CCP § 473 did not seek to modify the order denying attorney fees, but
rather asserted a different statute and different facts. (Ron Burns, 184
Cal.App.4th at 1419-20.) The Court of Appeal found that even though the fee
motion incorporated the earlier ex parte application, the ex parte application
did not bar CCP § 473 motion because it was denied without prejudice. (Id.
at 1420.) Relying on Standard Microsystems, the Court of Appeal further
found that because CCP § 473 is remedial, it must be construed liberally and
must prevail over CCP § 1008 to the extent the two statutes conflict. (Ibid.)

 
However, in Even Zohar, the California Supreme Court
found that CCP § 1008 governs renewed applications under CCP § 473(b). (Even
Zohar, 61 Cal.4th at 833.) The high court held that CCP § 1008 “expressly
applies to all renewed applications for orders the court has previously
refused.” (Id. at 840.) CCP “section 473(b) [does not] purport to
authorize unlimited repetitions of the same motion.” (Id. at 841.)
Accordingly, CCP section 473(b) and 1008(b) do not conflict. (Id. at
841-42.) Notably, the Supreme Court disapproved of Standard Microsystems and
Ron Burns to the extent that they conflict with its decision in Even
Zohar. (Id. at 844 [“[L]ower courts have expressed the view that
motions for relief . . . under section 473(b) need not comply with section 1008.  None of these decisions offers a persuasive
justification for its conclusion on that point”].) 
 
Thus, in accordance with Even Zohar, CCP § 1008
governs this renewed motion for relief under CCP § 473(b). As stated above,
petitioner seeks relief from the late filing of the motion for attorney fees on
the same ground as was asserted in the ex parte application, i.e., CCP §
473(b), which was denied on August 10, 2023. Petitioner has not cited any new
facts or law that warrants reconsideration of the August 10, 2023 order. 
 
Perhaps attempting to analogize to the finding in Ron
Burns that the trial court denied the ex parte application without prejudice,
petitioner also argues that, during the August 10, 2023 hearing, the Court stated
that it would consider a subsequently noticed motion under CCP § 473(b).
(Sunukjian Reply Decl. ¶¶ 1-2 & Ex. A.) It is the Court’s duty to consider
all motions that are properly reserved, noticed, and filed.  That the Court would have stated it considers
any motion properly reserved, noticed, and filed is not surprising.  Surely, however, the Court does not provide
an advisory opinion that it would reach the merits of a motion that fails
procedurally. In the absence of a transcript of proceedings demonstrating
otherwise, the Court must reject petitioner’s claim that the Court stated it
would consider a subsequently filed CCP § 473(b) on the merits irrespective of
any procedural defects, including the failure to satisfy the requirements of CCP
§ 1008. In any event, while dubious, if the Court had made any such statement, it
would not prevent the Court from properly applying the requirements of
§ 1008 now.  (See generally Even
Zohar, 61 Cal.4th at 840 [noting court’s inherent powers include ability to
reconsider previous interim orders on its own motion].)
 
For the reasons stated above, the Court has no jurisdiction
to reconsider the August 10, 2023 denial of petitioner’s ex parte application to
extend the deadline to file a fee motion. Even if the Court had jurisdiction, the
Court would not grant such relief. In this vein, the Court notes that arguably the
Court could not have reached in the first instance petitioner’s request for
relief under CCP § 473(b) on August 10, 2023, because there was no prior order from
which petitioner could obtain relief. (See CCP § 473(b) [“The court
may…relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment,
dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or
her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect”].)  Thus, arguably there is no § 473(b) decision
to reconsider.  Regardless, to the extent
petitioner is now entitled to seek relief based on mistake or excusable neglect
under CCP § 473(b), the Court would deny the motion for the reasons stated
in its August 10, 2023 ruling, incorporated by reference herein. (McEwen Decl.
¶ 26 & Ex. A to Ex. F.) Simply put, because CCP § 1013(a) expressly states
that it does not apply to extend the time to file a notice of appeal, counsel’s
neglect is not excusable. That conclusion is made all the more clear upon
review of the practice guide petitioner’s counsel consulted, which states
clearly in bold “No extension for notice of entry of judgment by mail” among
the “General Rules” under the section entitled “Calculating Appeal Time Periods,”
with the further explanation that CCP § 1013 “extensions do not
enlarge the time for filing a notice of appeal (i.e., the appeal deadline is not
extended when notice of entry of judgment is served by mail.” (Sunukjian Decl.
¶¶ 10-11 & Ex. A at 4-5).
 
Accordingly, petitioner is not entitled to relief under CCP
§ 473(b). 
 
The motion is DENIED.
