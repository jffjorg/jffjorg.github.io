And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the petition filed by Whitney Williams seeking relief from the claim statute. Williams was injured on February 23, 2022, and failed to present her claim to the City of Los Angeles, County of Los Angeles, and State of California within the six-month period. She only filed her claim on December 2, 2022, and her claims were subsequently denied. Williams is seeking relief under Government Code § 946.6, which allows for the late filing of a claim due to "mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect." However, the judge finds that Williams has not demonstrated reasonable diligence in presenting her claim, and therefore, her petition is denied.
