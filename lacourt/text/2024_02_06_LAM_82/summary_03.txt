And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the parties' submissions and has made a tentative ruling on the case. The City of El Monte filed an opposition brief late, without explanation or leave, and the judge has declined to consider it. The judge finds that notice to the park residents was sufficient, even if it did not follow the exact wording of the ordinance. The dispute over whether "designated representative" is the same as "resident representative" is immaterial to the outcome. The judge will issue a final ruling once the parties have an opportunity to respond to the tentative ruling.
