Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the petition for relief from the denial of the motion for attorney fees due to untimely filing. The petition was filed under CCP § 473(b), which allows a party to seek relief from a judgment or order based on mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. However, the court found that the petitioner's counsel did not provide a satisfactory explanation for the failure to present new facts, circumstances, or law to support the relief sought. The court also found that the petition was untimely filed, as the petitioner's counsel had 10 days from August 10, 2023, to file a motion for reconsideration, but did not do so until December 7, 2023. The court noted that the petitioner's counsel did not provide any new reasons why the mistake to not consider the entirety of CCP § 1013(a) was excusable, and therefore declined to exercise discretion to grant relief. The court also cited CCP § 1008, which governs renewed applications under CCP § 473(b), and found that the petitioner's motion did not meet the requirements of that statute.
