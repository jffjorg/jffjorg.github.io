MOTION
TO STRIKE ANSWER


 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiffs
Mayra Ysela Rivera Sanchez, et al.
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On September 19, 2019, Plaintiffs, Mayra Ysela Rivera
Sanchez and Drexler Pacia Serrato, filed a Complaint against Defendant, Victory
Bistro Cafe, alleging various Labor Code violations.  Defendant is a corporation.
 
            On December
19, 2019, Defendant filed an Answer to the Complaint.
 
            On December
1, 2023, counsel for Defendant was relieved as counsel of record. 
 
            On December
20, 2023, Plaintiffs filed this motion to strike Defendant’s Answer.  
 
            The motion
is unopposed.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD FOR MOTION TO STRIKE  
            Any
party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading, may serve and file a
motion to strike the whole pleading or any part thereof.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 435, subd. (b)(1); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1322, subd. (b).)¿ On a
motion to strike, the court may: (1) strike out any irrelevant, false, or
improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike out all or any part of
any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of California, a
court rule, or an order of the court.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subds.
(a)-(b); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782.)¿ 
            “The
grounds for a motion to strike are limited to matters appearing on the face of
the challenged pleading or matters which must or may be judicially noticed. (§
437, subd. (a); Evid. Code, §§ 451, 452.).” (Garcia v. Sterling (1985)
176 Cal.App.3d 17, 20.) 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
            Plaintiff moves for an order to strike Defendant’s
Answer.  On December 1, 2023, the Court
granted defense counsel’s motion to be relieved as counsel.  Defendant is a corporation.  As such, Plaintiff contends that Defendant cannot
represent itself.  
 
Plaintiff is correct.  “Under a long-standing common law rule of
procedure, a corporation, unlike a natural person, cannot represent itself
before courts of record in propria persona, nor can it represent itself
through a corporate officer, director, or other employee who is not an
attorney.¿ It must be represented by licensed counsel in proceedings before
courts of record.” (CLD Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon
(2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1145.)¿ As a corporation, Defendant may not appear
in this action except through licensed counsel.  
 
            IV.        CONCLUSION

            
The motion to strike Defendant’s Answer, filed December 19,
2019, is GRANTED.  Plaintiffs may purse
default proceedings against Defendant.
 
Moving party to give notice, unless waived.
