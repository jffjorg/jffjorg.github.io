And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion for a new trial. The motion was filed after the defendant's motion for summary judgment was granted. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant, Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), had constructive notice of the dangerous condition that caused her to slip and fall on the floor. The judge concludes that the evidence presented by the defendant was sufficient to support the summary judgment motion and that the plaintiff failed to establish the necessary grounds for a new trial.

The judge notes that the defendant presented declarations from two employees who walked on the same area of the floor 15 minutes prior to the plaintiff's fall and did not notice any spill or hazardous condition. The plaintiff did not rebut this evidence and failed to establish that the defendant had constructive notice of the condition. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's expert evidence on the dangerousness of the flooring itself was not relevant to the issue of constructive notice.

The judge's tentative ruling is based on the following statutes and case law: Code of Civil Procedure sections 656 and 657, Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co., Fomco, Inc. v. Joe Maggio, Inc., Mercer v. Perez, Pacific Trends Lamp & Lighting Products, Inc. v. J. White Inc., State of California v. Superior Court, Strongman v. County of Kern, and Heskel v. City of San Diego.

The judge's ruling is final unless modified or reversed by the court on or before the hearing date of January 17, 2024.
