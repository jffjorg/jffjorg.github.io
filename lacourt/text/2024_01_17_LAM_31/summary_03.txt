And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiffs' motion to strike the defendant's answer, filed on December 19, 2019. The defendant, Victory Bistro Cafe, is a corporation and cannot represent itself in court without licensed counsel. Since defense counsel was relieved on December 1, 2023, the defendant is not represented by licensed counsel and is unable to appear in the action. The judge orders the plaintiffs to pursue default proceedings against the defendant.
