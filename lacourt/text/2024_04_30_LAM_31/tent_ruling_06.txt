MOTION
TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO DISCOVERY 



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
John E. Bouzane dba Fast Eviction Service
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendants PAMA
Management Inc.
 
 
 
On December 8, 2023, Plaintiff, John E. Bouzane dba Fast
Eviction Service, filed motions to compel Defendants and Cross-Complainants,
PAMA Management Inc. and Golden Management Services, Inc., to provide further
responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set One, Nos.
1-27, 30-38 40, 45-74, and 77-81.
 
On January 4, 2024, the court continued the motions to allow
the parties to participate in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC). 
 
On January 24, 2024, the court held an IDC with the
parties.  The issues were not resolved.  The court directed counsel to meet and confer
re: five topics no later than February 5, 2024 and ordered Counsel for
Plaintiff to prepare and submit a Notice of Outcome within five court days
following the meet and confer.  To date,
Plaintiff has not filed a Notice of Outcome. 
 
On April 17, 2024, Defendants filed their oppositions to
Plaintiff’s motions.  In the oppositions,
Defendants argue the motions should be denied because after the IDC, Defendants
producents thousands of documents that were responsive to Plaintiff’s Request
for Production of Documents.  Thereafter,
Counsel for Defendants contacted Plaintiff’s Counsel to inquire whether the
document production satisfied Plaintiff in order to take these motions off
calendar.  Plaintiff’s Counsel advised he
would respond in a few days, however, to do date, Plaintiff’s Counsel has not
indicated whether Plaintiff will be moving forward with these motions.
 
Given Defendants’ uncontested representation that responsive
documents were produced to Plaintiff, and Plaintiff’s failure to advise the
court of the status of this discovery dispute, the court finds these motions
are MOOT.
 
 
Clerk of the Court to give notice.
