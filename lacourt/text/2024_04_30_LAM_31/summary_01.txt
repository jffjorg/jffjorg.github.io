**Case Summary**

The court issued a tentative ruling on a special motion to strike (anti-SLAPP) filed by Defendant Azealia Banks against Plaintiff Jeff Kwatinetz's Eighth Cause of Action for Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED). The motion was brought under California Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16, which permits a court to strike a cause of action arising from an act in furtherance of the defendant's right of petition or free speech.

**Key Points**

1. The court denied Banks's motion, finding that she failed to demonstrate how the Eighth Cause of Action arose from protected activity.
2. The court found that Banks's rants and threats against Kwatinetz and his family qualified for protection under sections 425.16(e)(3) and (e)(4) as statements made in connection with a public issue of interest.
3. The court held that Banks's statements were not criminal or illegal as a matter of law, citing the narrow exception for illegal activity in the anti-SLAPP statute.
4. The court denied the motion, stating that Kwatinetz had demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the IIED claim.
