Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to quash the subpoena issued by Elite Veterinary Corporation to North Valley Veterinary Clinic, Inc. The court finds that the subpoena seeks evidence that is not relevant or reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The court disagrees with Elite Veterinary's contention that the subpoena seeks evidence relevant to addressing the plaintiff's testimony that Dr. David disparaged her in communicating with potential employers, thereby preventing employment opportunities after Elite Veterinary. The court finds that the subpoena categories relate to the plaintiff's work performance and the reasons for her termination from employment with North Valley, and do not match Elite Veterinary's theory of relevance. The motion to quash the subpoena is granted.
