And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the parties' submissions and has made the following findings: the transcript of Banks' deposition testimony is not subject to the January 4, 2022, protective order because it was not timely designated as confidential. Additionally, the USB drive containing the video was properly and timely served. Banks' objections to the use of the transcript and USB drive are overruled. The court has also declined to consider Banks' allegation that she posted a photograph of herself standing near Kwatinetz's house on Instagram, as she failed to address this issue in her motion.
