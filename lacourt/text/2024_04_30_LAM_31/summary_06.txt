And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling dismissing Plaintiff John E. Bouzane's motion to compel further responses to discovery after Defendants PAMA Management Inc. produced thousands of responsive documents. The court notes that Plaintiff's counsel failed to advise the court of the status of the discovery dispute, despite Defendants' inquiry. Given the uncontested production of documents by Defendants, the court finds the motion to compel is moot.
