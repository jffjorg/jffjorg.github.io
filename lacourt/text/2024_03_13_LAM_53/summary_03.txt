Significant Statements:
  - "Generally, court records are presumed to be open unless confidentiality is required by law."
  - "If the presumption of access applies, the court may order that a record be filed under seal 'if it expressly finds facts that establish: (1) There exists an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record; (2) The overriding interest supports sealing the record; (3) A substantial probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed; (4) The proposed sealing is narrowly tailored; and (5) No less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest.'"
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the plaintiff's motion to seal certain documents containing confidential and sensitive information. The plaintiff's identification of trade secrets and amended identification of trade secrets contain confidential information that should be protected. The defendant's opposition briefs reference or quote information that has been sealed by the court and may contain trade secret or proprietary information. The court finds that the overriding interest of protecting this confidential information outweighs the right of public access to the records. The court grants the plaintiff's motion to seal the specified portions of the documents and orders the defendant to file revised redacted versions of his opposition briefs.
