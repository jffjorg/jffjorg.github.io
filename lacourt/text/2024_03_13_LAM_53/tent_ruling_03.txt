MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Forex Express Corp.,
d/b/a WireCash          
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to Seal
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Forex Express Corp., d/b/a WireCash (“Plaintiff”) moves the
court for an order sealing the following documents: (1) Plaintiff’s
Identification of Trade Secrets, attached to the declaration of Elliot Z. Chen
as Exhibit 3, filed by defendant Eliran Grushkowsky (“Defendant”) on January
25, 2024 in support of his opposition to Plaintiff’s motion to seal, as to (i)
page 3, lines 10-16, (ii) page 4, lines 6-11 and 21-26, and (iii) page 5, lines
5-6, 14-18, and 19-23;        (2)
Plaintiff’s Amended Identification of Trade Secrets, attached to the
declaration of Elliot Z. Chen as Exhibit 3, filed by Defendant on January 24,
2024, in support of his opposition to Plaintiff’s motion to seal amended
identification of trade secrets, as to (i) page 2, lines 19-28 through page 3,
lines 1-27, (ii) page 4, lines 20-27, (iii) page 5, lines 16-21, (iv) page 6,
lines 4-10, 14-16, and 24-28 through page 7, lines 1-2, and (v) page 7, lines
3-7; (3) portions of Defendant’s opposition to Plaintiff’s motion to seal trade
secret disclosure, filed on January 25, 2024, and specifically (i) page 9,
lines 7-10, and (ii) page 12, lines 10-15 and 17-18; and              (4) portions of Defendant’s
opposition to Plaintiff’s motion to seal amended trade secret disclosure, filed
on January 24, 2024, and specifically (i) page 9, lines 7-8, (ii) page 11, line
28 through page 12, lines 1-5, and (iii) page 12, lines 7-8.
Generally,
court records are presumed to be open unless confidentiality is required by
law.¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.550, subd. (c).)¿ If the presumption of
access applies, the court may order that a record be filed under seal “if it
expressly finds facts that establish: (1) There exists an overriding interest
that overcomes the right of public access to the record; (2) The overriding
interest supports sealing the record; (3) A substantial probability exists that
the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed; (4) The
proposed sealing is narrowly tailored; and (5) No less restrictive means exist
to achieve the overriding interest.”¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.550, subd.
(d).)¿¿¿¿ 
The court
finds that (1) there exists an overriding interest that overcomes the right of
public access to the specified portions of (i) Plaintiff’s Identification of
Trade Secrets,                 (ii)
Plaintiff’s Amended Identification of Trade Secrets, and (iii) Defendant’s
opposition briefs, filed on January 24, 2024, and January 25, 2024, because
those filings set forth, reference, or quote information that has been sealed
by the court and may contain Plaintiff’s trade secret or proprietary
information; (2) the overriding interest supports sealing the record to protect
this confidential and sensitive information; (3) a substantial probability
exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the records are not
sealed; (4) the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored; and (5) no less
restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest.  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 2.550.)  The court therefore grants Plaintiff’s motion.
ORDER
The court grants plaintiff Forex Express Corp.’s motion to seal. 
The court orders that the unredacted version of “Defendant Eliran

The court orders defendant Eliran Grushkowsky to file (1) a revised
redacted version of “Defendant Eliran Grushkowsky’s Opposition to Plaintiff
Forex Express Corp.’s Motion for Order to Seal Plaintiff’s Identification of

12, lines 10-15, and page 12, lines 17-18, and (2) a revised redacted version

11, line 28 through page 12, lines 1-5, and page 12, lines 7-8.
Pursuant
to California Rules of Court, rule 2.551, subdivision (e), the court directs

ruling.
