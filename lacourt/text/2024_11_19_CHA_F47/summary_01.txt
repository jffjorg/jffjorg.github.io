And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the petition filed by Brookside Walk Corporation, a homeowners association for a condominium residential development, seeking an order reducing the percentage of votes necessary to amend the Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions and Reservation of Easements. The existing Declaration requires 67% membership approval for amendments, but the Petitioner failed to obtain the required votes. The Petitioner worked with its attorney to draft the "Proposed First Amendment to the CC&Rs" to lessen the financial burden of insurance coverage on the association and prevent future special assessments to cover increasing premiums. Despite diligent efforts to have Members vote, only 92 ballots were returned, with 87 voting "yes" in favor of adopting the Proposed Amendment. The Petitioner met the statutory requirements for such relief and the Judge finds that the petition is granted.
