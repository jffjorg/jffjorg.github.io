WRIT OF
POSSESSION
 
Application filed on 8/8/24.
 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff Ally Bank 
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant Jeremy Mathiason
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: A writ of possession regarding a
2021 Ram 1500 motor vehicle 
(VIN 1C6SRFU94MN900541), with a value of $71,325.00.
 
RULING: 
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Defendant Jeremy Mathiason’s
(Defendant) purchase of a 2021 Ram 1500 motor vehicle (the Vehicle) on or about
4/6/21 pursuant to a Retail Installment Sale Contract which has been assigned
to Plaintiff Ally Bank (Plaintiff).  (Singleton
Decl., Ex.A).  Pursuant to the contract,
upon default, Plaintiff has the right to immediate possession of the
Vehicle.  (Id., Ex.A, B).
 
Defendant is in default under the contract due to his
failure to make the payment due and owing on 1/21/24 in the amount of
$1,043.75, or any of the regular monthly payments of $1,391.66 due
thereafter.  (Singleton Decl.).  Despite Plaintiff’s demand for surrender of
the Vehicle, Defendant has failed to surrender the Vehicle to Plaintiff.  Id. 
As of 7/9/24, there is due, owing and unpaid to Plaintiff on the
contract the amount of $48,217.76 together with other charges as provided by
the contract.  Id.  The Vehicle currently has a value between
$71,325.00 and $79,100.00.  Id.
 
Based on the foregoing, on 7/30/24, Plaintiff filed this
action against Defendant and Does 1-10 for Claim and Delivery of Personal
Property.  On 8/8/24, Plaintiff filed the
instant application against Defendant seeking an order granting a pre-trial writ
of possession regarding a 2021 Ram 1500 motor vehicle (VIN 1C6SRFU94MN900541),
with a value of $71,325.00.  Defendant
has not opposed or otherwise responded to the application. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Upon a showing of the probable validity of Plaintiff’s
right to possession of the Vehicle, a writ of possession shall issue subject to
posting any applicable bond or undertaking. 
See CCP 512.060(a).  A
claim has probable validity if it is more likely than not that the plaintiff
will obtain a judgment against the defendant on the claim.  See CCP 511.090.  
 
Upon the issuing of a writ of possession, the Court may
also order the Defendant to transfer possession of the property to the Plaintiff.  See CCP 512.070.
The declaration of James Singleton submitted in support
of the application, and lack of response thereto, establishes the probable
validity of Plaintiff’s claim against Defendant.  However, Plaintiff provides no information
regarding the undertaking requirements pursuant to CCP 515.010 which must be
met before the Court can issue a writ of possession.  See CCP 512.060(a)(2); CCP
515.010.  
 
The Court may take additional oral and documentary
evidence at the claim and delivery hearing. 
CCP 512.050.
 
CONCLUSION
 
If Plaintiff provides sufficient evidence at or before
the hearing regarding the amount of an appropriate undertaking or that an
undertaking is not required under the circumstances, the application will be
granted accordingly.  
 
If not, the hearing will be continued to allow for the
submission of such evidence.
