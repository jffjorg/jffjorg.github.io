LEGAL STANDARD
 
            California
Code of Civil Procedure section 1987.1, subdivision (a) provides:¿ 
¿ 
If a subpoena requires the attendance of a
witness or the production of books, documents, or other things before a court,
or at the trial of an issue therein, or at the taking of a deposition, the
court, upon motion reasonably made by any person described in subdivision (b),
or upon the court's own motion after giving counsel notice and an opportunity
to be heard, may make an order quashing the subpoena entirely, modifying it, or
directing compliance with it upon those terms or conditions as the court shall
declare, including protective orders. In addition, the court may make any other
order as may be appropriate to protect the person from unreasonable or
oppressive demands, including unreasonable violations of the right of privacy
of the person.¿ 
¿ 
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 1987.1 subd. (a).)  
 
There is no requirement that the motion
contain a meet and confer declaration. (See Code of Civ. Proc., § 1987.1.) A
motion to quash the production of documents or tangible things at deposition
must be accompanied by a separate statement. (CRC Rule 3.1345(a)(5).)¿ 
 
The right of privacy of individuals is
protected by the California Constitution. (Cal. Const., Art. I, § 1.) In ruling
on discovery motions, the Court must balance the privacy claims of the
responding party with the requesting party’s need for the information. (Schnabel
v. Superior Court (1993) 5 Cal.4th 704, 718-722.)¿ 
 ¿ 
“[P]laintiffs are ‘not obligated to sacrifice
all privacy to seek redress for a specific [physical,] mental or emotional
injury’; while they may not withhold information which relates to any physical
or mental condition which they have put in issue by bringing [a] lawsuit, . . .
they are entitled to retain the confidentiality of all unrelated medical or
psychotherapeutic treatment they may have undergone in the past.” (Britt v.
Superior Court (1978) 20 C.3d 844, 864, citation and footnote
omitted.)¿However, “. . . privacy interests may have to give way to [an]
opponent’s right to a fair trial.¿Thus, courts must balance the right of civil
litigants to discover relevant facts against the privacy interests of persons
subject to discovery.” (Vinson v. Superior Court (1987) 43 Cal.3d 833,
842.)¿ 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
On August 25, 2022,
at approximately 1:30 PM, Plaintiff allegedly slipped and fell at the Costco
warehouse located at 14501 Hindry Avenue, Hawthorne, CA. The alleged incident
was caused by spilled antibacterial liquid soap on the floor, which created a hazardous
condition. The defendant allegedly failed to clean up the spill or warn
customers about the danger.
 
Plaintiff requests
the Courts quash or, in the alternative, significantly modify the depositions
subpoenas issued by Defendant. Plaintiff argues that the subpoenas seek
information regarding body parts and timeframes not at issue.
 
Plaintiff argues
that California strongly protects medical record privacy through constitutional
and statutory provisions. While there is a party-litigant exception allowing
disclosure of relevant medical records in personal injury cases, it does not
permit unrestricted access to an individual's entire medical history. Plaintiff
asserts that only medical information directly related to the injuries claimed
in the lawsuit can be disclosed, and unrelated treatment remains protected. (Britt,
supra, 20 C.3d 844, 864)
 
 Plaintiff asserts that mere speculation that
past medical records might be relevant is insufficient and that Defendant has
the burden of showing the records are directly relevant to the issues at hand.
(Roberts v. Superior Court, (1973) 9 Cal3d 330, 339; Tylo v. Superior
Court, (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1390-1391.)  Courts must balance the need for discovery
against the intrusion into privacy, particularly for sensitive information. (Valley
Bank of Nevada v. Superior Ct., (1975) 15 Cal.3d 652, 657.)  Plaintiff argues that broadly worded
subpoenas that demand all medical records without restriction to specific
injuries at issue are unreasonable and violate privacy rights. Plaintiff
maintains that filing a personal injury lawsuit does not waive her entire
medical history and requests that the subpoena be limited to avoid unjustified
intrusion.
 
In opposition, Defendant
argues that while California law recognizes medical privacy, this right is not
absolute and must be balanced against the need for discovery when a plaintiff
places their medical condition at issue. (Vinson, supra43 Cal.3d 833,
842.)  Courts evaluate privacy claims by
considering the extent of the privacy right, the seriousness of the intrusion,
and the relevance of the requested information. (Williams v. Superior Court (2017)
3 Cal.5th 531, 556.)  Plaintiff's broad
and extensive claims of injuries, spanning multiple body parts, emotional
distress, and the need for future surgeries, justify Costco’s need for
comprehensive discovery to test the validity of her allegations.
 
Defendant
emphasizes that Plaintiff admitted to prior and subsequent injuries, including
sciatica pain in 2007 and a June 2023 injury affecting her lower back, knees,
and hips. These prior conditions are directly relevant to determining whether
Plaintiff’s claimed injuries resulted from the subject incident. (See Britt
v. Superior Court, supra, 20 Cal.3d at p. 872.) As such, Defendant argues
that the discovery of medical records, including billing and radiological
records, is necessary for a fair evaluation of Plaintiff’s claims and to
establish alternative causes for her injuries.
 
Defendant also
asserts that Plaintiff waived any medical privilege by placing her physical
condition in issue; Plaintiff cannot claim injuries while withholding medical
evidence. (See Evid. Code, § 996; City & County of S.F. v. Superior
Court (1951) 37 Cal.2d 227, 232.) This waiver extends to relevant medical
records necessary for a meaningful defense and fair trial. Defendant concludes
that Costco's subpoenas are reasonable, directly relevant, and necessary to
ascertain the truth behind Plaintiff's extensive and unfocused claims.
Plaintiff’s motion to quash lacks merit, as it seeks to suppress information
critical to Defendant’s case.
 
In reply, Plaintiff
argues that Defendant's subpoena is overly broad, oppressive, and burdensome
because it seeks medical records without a reasonable time limitation, is not
restricted to the body parts at issue, and requests all records "relating
to Plaintiff," which is undefined.
 
Plaintiff asserts
that Defendant has failed to meet its burden to demonstrate that the requested
records are directly relevant to the claims at issue. (Tylo, supra, 55
Cal.App.4th 1379, 1390-1387.)  Mere
speculation that the records might uncover relevant material is insufficient.
In Davis, the court rejected similar overbroad discovery attempts,
reasoning that speculation alone does not justify invading constitutionally
protected medical records. (Davis v. Superior Court (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1008, 1015.)
 
Plaintiff further
emphasizes that Defendant's reliance on prior sciatica treatment from 2007-2008
and a subsequent injury in 2023 does not justify a blanket 20-year subpoena
into Plaintiff's entire medical history. Plaintiff proposes a reasonable
alternative, limiting the scope of discovery to 10 years, with targeted records
related to back pain in 2007-2008. Plaintiff argues that Defendant's refusal to
narrow its scope amounts to an abuse of the discovery process and an
unconscionable violation of Plaintiff’s privacy rights. (Harris v. Superior
Court, 3 Cal.App.4th at p. 665.) 
 
Plaintiff is
correct in asserting that the discovery of medical information is limited to
information related to the matter at hand. (Britt, supra, 20
C.3d 844, 864.) However,  Plaintiff’s
ongoing injury claims include: “Right shin: Tenderness and scar; Getting
better; Every time I touch it; Left Knee: Torn Meniscus; Getting worse; Every
day; Right Knee: Pain; getting worse; Every day; Left Hip: bursitis; getting
worse; Every day; Right Hip: Pain; getting worse; Every day; Lower Back: Pain;
getting worse; Every day; Shoulders: Pain; getting worse; Every time I get
active; Neck: Pain: Pain; getting worse; Every time I get active; Emotional
Distress: anxiety and depression due to the pain; getting worse; every day;
Headaches; getting worse; every time my body hurts; Difficulty sleeping:
getting worse; every night; Fatigue: getting worse; every day; Drowsiness:
subsiding; every time my body hurts; Dizziness: subsiding; every time my body
hurts; Loss of Balance: getting worse; every time my knees hurts; Sensitivity
to light and sound: getting worse; every time I got a headache; Concentration
Problems: getting worse; every time my body hurts; Mood changes: getting worse;
every time my body hurts; Weakness on Ankles: getting; every time my knees
hurts; Weight gain: getting worse; frequently; Increase on the bathroom use
frequency: getting worse; every night.” Furthermore, Plaintiff claims she will
need to have back surgery, knee surgery, hip surgery, and transoral outlet
reduction due to weight gain because of the incident.
 
Through her claimed injuries, Plaintiff has
put every part of her body at issue. While Plaintiff cites Davis as
support for her argument, the injuries claimed in Davis were much less
broad than Plaintiffs. (Davis, supra, 7 Cal.App.4th 1008, 1015.) In Davis,
the only claimed injuries were arm, shoulder, back, neck, and knee pain, as
well as emotional distress; given the Plaintiff's much longer list of claimed
injuries, the Court finds Davis distinguishable. (Id.)  Therefore, the Court finds that the broad
subpoenas are reasonable in this case based on their relevance to Plaintiff's
broad injury claims.  (Vinson, supra, 43
Cal.3d 833, 842.)
 
However, the Court finds that not limiting the
time period to 10 years is overbroad as all injuries stem from the alleged trip
and fall incident. Thus, medical records from long before the incident are not
relevant. (Vinson, supra, 43 Cal.3d 833, 842.) However, given Plaintiff's
previous experience with back pain, the Court does think that information
regarding Plaintiff’s treatment for sciatica back pain is relevant to her current
claim for back pain.
 
Therefore, the Court limits the deposition
subpoena to the last 10 years of medical history with an exception for
treatment of back pain from 2007-2008. The Court denies the request to limit
the scope of the medical records subpoenas to certain body parts.
 
Sanctions
 
The Court has
discretion to award reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred in
making or opposing a motion under Section 1987.1 if the Court finds the motion
was made or opposed in bad faith or without substantial justification or that
one or more of the requirements of the subpoena was oppressive. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1987.2, subd. (a).)  
 
Plaintiff requests
the Court impose sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $5,440. However,
given the Court’s partial denial of the instant motion, the Court finds that
Defendant had substantial justification for opposing this motion. 
 
Therefore, the
Court denies the request for sanctions.
