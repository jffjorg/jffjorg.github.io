Significant Statements:

* The right of privacy of individuals is protected by the California Constitution.
* A party-litigant exception allowing disclosure of relevant medical records in personal injury cases does not permit unrestricted access to an individual's entire medical history.
* The court finds that the broad subpoenas are reasonable in this case based on their relevance to Plaintiff's broad injury claims.
* The Court limits the deposition subpoena to the last 10 years of medical history with an exception for treatment of back pain from 2007-2008.
