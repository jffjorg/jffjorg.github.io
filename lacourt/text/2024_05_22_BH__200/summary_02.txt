Dates:
  - [insert dates relevant to the case]
Events:
  - Hearing on motion
  - Trial
  - Listing of chemical as known to the state to cause reproductive toxicity
  - Determination of whether a level of exposure to a chemical has no observable effect
Money:
  - None mentioned
  Intentions:
    - To determine whether a level of exposure to a chemical has no observable effect
  Facts:
    - Exposure to chemicals can cause reproductive toxicity
    - Subpopulations may have different exposure levels
    - OEHHA provides assumptions for exposure resulting from consumption of goods or consumer products
  Disputes:
    - CAG's ethnic subpopulation theory vs. Defendants' position
  Acts:
    - Filing of motion
    - Hearing on motion
    - Determination of whether a level of exposure to a chemical has no observable effect
  Agreements:
    - Sec. 25721(d)(4) applicable to foods for purposes of cancer
    - Sec. 25805(b) applicable to reproductive toxicity
  Laws:
    - Sec. 25721(d)(4)
    - Sec. 25805(b)

  Case Citations:

    - California Health and Safety Code
  Roles:
    - Judge Beaudet
    - Judge (unnamed)
  Significant Statements:
    - The Court recognizes that CAG's position is that the issue is not one of considering exposure within an ethnic subpopulation but what defendants should "reasonably expect."
    - The Court finds that the omission of the remaining part of the interpretation would not amount to fraud.
    - The Court has also considered that the direct testimony of Petersen hinges on averaging of exposure to lead (and arsenic) for purposes of reproductive toxicity.

And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses the issue of whether a level of exposure to a chemical has no observable effect for purposes of reproductive toxicity. The court considers the scientific evidence and standards of comparable scientific validity to determine whether a chemical is known to the state to cause reproductive toxicity. The court also considers the applicability of subpopulations to consumer products and the relevance of exposure to environmental and occupational exposure. The court finds that the omission of the remaining part of the interpretation would not amount to fraud and that the court is not reconsidering the issue. The court relies on California Health and Safety Code and relevant case law, including Di Pirro v. Bondo Corp. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 150.
