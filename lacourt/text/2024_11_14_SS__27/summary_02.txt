And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion for a new trial. The plaintiff had argued that the court incorrectly applied Labor Code Section 2775 in the joint employer context and that there is insufficient evidence to support the court's conclusion that the plaintiff was an employee of CarParts. The court had previously granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment, finding that the plaintiff was an independent contractor and not an employee under the workers' compensation exclusivity rule.

In denying the motion for a new trial, the court found that the plaintiff's arguments were without merit. The court noted that Labor Code Section 2775 and the ABC test apply to determine employment status under the workers' compensation exclusivity rule, and that the plaintiff failed to show that he was free from CarParts' control and direction, that he performed work outside CarParts' usual course of business, and that he was customarily engaged in an independently established trade.

The court also rejected the plaintiff's reliance on previous cases, such as Patterson v. Domino's Pizza and Nichols v. Arthur Murray, Inc., which focused on common law employment principles and placed significant weight on contractual terms and the parties' intent. The court found that these cases were distinguishable and did not apply to the facts of this case.
