And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel multiple examinations, including a neuropsychological examination and two orthopedic examinations. The defendant seeks to conduct these examinations to assess the extent of the plaintiff's injuries, including a traumatic brain injury and injuries to his foot, shoulder, and back.

The judge has ruled that the neuropsychological examination is necessary to assess the full extent of the plaintiff's alleged traumatic brain injury and its effect on his cognitive abilities and daily functioning. The judge has also ruled that the raw data from the testing portion of the examination will be provided directly to the plaintiff's counsel, subject to a protective order to maintain confidentiality and restrict its use to this case.

The judge has also permitted two separate orthopedic examinations, as the plaintiff has undergone significant surgical interventions on both his foot and shoulder. The judge has ruled that the expertise of two orthopedic specialists, one focused on foot and ankle surgery and another on shoulder and spine, is justified given the complexity of the plaintiff's injuries and the need for specialized evaluations.

The judge has set a deadline of 30 days for the plaintiff to attend the mental examination and the orthopedic examinations. The judge has also denied sanctions, finding that neither party acted in bad faith.

The parties are required to submit to this tentative ruling by emailing the court, and if they do not submit, they will be required to appear at the hearing to argue.
