And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a motion for good faith settlement filed by Cross-Defendant Joel Aguirre. The motion seeks an order that would preclude any contribution or indemnity claims against Aguirre by the non-settling defendants, including the City of Los Angeles and Peter Barajas, based on comparative negligence or fault. The settlement agreement was reached between Aguirre and Plaintiff Matthew Martinez for $2,000 and was executed on [date]. The City of Los Angeles filed a Cross-Complaint against Aguirre seeking indemnification, apportionment of fault, and declaratory relief.

The court will determine whether the settlement was made in good faith based on the information available at the time of settlement. The court will consider the factors listed in Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates (1985) 38 Cal.3d 488, including a rough approximation of plaintiff's total recovery and the settlor's proportionate liability, the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs, and a recognition that a settlor should pay less in settlement than he would if he were found liable after a trial.

The court finds that the settlement was made in good faith and grants the motion. The court notes that the motion is unopposed and there are no other filings objecting to the settlement at issue.
