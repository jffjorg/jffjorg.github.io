Summary: The judge grants the defendant's motion for sanctions in part, but denies it in part. The defendant sought terminating sanctions against the plaintiff for alleged discovery abuse, including failure to comply with court orders and pay monetary sanctions. The judge finds that the plaintiff has made significant efforts to comply with court orders, but notes that the plaintiff has not fully complied with the orders and has an outstanding balance of $2,475 in monetary sanctions. The judge grants a monetary sanction against the plaintiff and his attorney in the amount of $2,000, payable to the defendant within 20 days. The judge also orders the plaintiff to appear for the continued deposition within 20 days and to produce the outstanding documents.
