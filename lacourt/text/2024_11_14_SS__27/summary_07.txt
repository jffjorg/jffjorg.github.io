And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied the Defendant's motion to compel a mental examination of the Plaintiff. The motion was filed after the discovery cut-off date, and the Court had already denied the parties' stipulation to reopen discovery. The Defendant had ample time to conduct the Plaintiff's deposition and mental examination but failed to do so. The Court finds that the Defendant has not shown good cause to reopen discovery and that the motion should be denied.
