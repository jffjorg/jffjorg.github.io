Legal Standard 
“A motion for new trial
is a creature of statute; . . .” (Neal v. Montgomery Elevator Co.¿(1992)
7 Cal. App. 4th 1194, 1198.) A movant must satisfy Code of Civil Procedure
sections 657 and 659. Under Code of Civil Procedure section 657, a motion for
new trial may be granted if there is any: 
 1. Irregularity in the proceedings of the
court, jury, or adverse party, or any order of the court or abuse of discretion
by which either party was prevented from having a fair trial. [¶] 2. Misconduct
of the jury; and whenever any one or more of the jurors have been induced to
assent to any general or special verdict, or to a finding on any question
submitted to them by the court, by a resort to the determination of chance,
such misconduct may be proved by the affidavit of any one of the jurors. [¶] 3.
Accident or surprise, which ordinary prudence could not have guarded against.
[¶] 4. Newly discovered evidence, material for the party making the
application, which he could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered and
produced at the trial. [¶] 5. Excessive or inadequate damages. [¶] 6.
Insufficiency of the evidence to justify the verdict or other decision, or the
verdict or other decision is against law. [¶] 7. Error in law, occurring at the
trial and excepted to by the party making the application.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 657.)   
A new trial motion is
available to challenge a summary judgment. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield
Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 858.)
Background
Under Labor Code
sections 3600 and 3601 et seq., the exclusive remedy rule holds that workers'
compensation is the sole remedy against an employer for an employee’s injury or
death arising during the course and scope of employment. “Under the Workers’
Compensation Act, employees are automatically entitled to recover benefits for
injuries ‘arising out of and in the course of’ their employment. When the
conditions of compensation exist, recovery under the workers’ compensation
scheme is the exclusive remedy against an employer for injury or death of an
employee” (Piscitelli v. Friedenberg (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 953, 986,
internal citations omitted). The primary issue in the MSJ was whether Plaintiff
was an employee of Defendant CarParts for the workers' compensation exclusive
remedy to apply.
On June 11, 2024, the
Court heard Defendant CarParts’ motion for summary judgment and took the matter
under submission. On June 20, 2024, the Court ordered the parties to file
briefs addressing (1) the applicability of California Labor Code Section 2775 and
(2) if applicable, the impact of this section on the case. After reviewing the
parties' supplemental briefs, the Court issued a ruling on July 8, 2024,
granting Defendant’s motion for summary judgment.
Plaintiff now moves the
Court for a new trial, raising two primary arguments. First, Plaintiff contends
that the Court incorrectly applied Section 2775 in the joint employer context,
relying on Henderson v. Equilon Enterprises, LLC (2019) 40 Cal.App.5th
1211. Second, Plaintiff argues that there is insufficient evidence to support
the Court’s conclusion that Plaintiff was an employee of CarParts.
Discussion
Applicability of Labor
Code 2775
In Plaintiff’s
supplemental briefing on the applicability of Labor Code Section 2775,
Plaintiff argued that Section 2775 does not apply in a joint employment
context, citing Henderson v. Equilon Enterprises, LLC (2019) 40
Cal.App.5th 1211. Plaintiff maintained that Section 2775, and specifically the
ABC test it codifies, should not govern employment status in workers’
compensation cases. Instead, Plaintiff contended that the multi-factor test,
historically used in workers' compensation cases and illustrated in Henderson,
should apply, asserting that Section 2700 provides a “carve-out” for cases
falling under the workers’ compensation provisions of Section 3600 et seq.
The Court considered
but ultimately rejected Plaintiff’s argument. The Court clarified that Section
2775 does not exempt workers’ compensation cases from the ABC test. Although
the multi-factor test has been used by courts in the past to determine employment
relationships, the Court found that it is a judicially created standard, not
one explicitly provided for in the statutory framework. In contrast, Section
2775 creates a clear statutory mandate requiring the ABC test to determine
employment status under the Labor Code. This encompasses all relevant sections
of the Labor Code, including Sections 3600 and 3601 et seq., which set forth
the workers' compensation exclusivity rule.
Accordingly, the Court
concluded that Section 2775 and the ABC test apply to this case in determining
whether Plaintiff was an employee of CarParts. Plaintiff’s current motion
essentially reiterates the arguments raised in the supplemental brief, which the
Court has already fully considered and rejected.
Contractual Intent
Plaintiff’s argument
that emphasizes the contractual agreement between CarParts and nGroup and the
parties' intent to establish an independent contractor relationship is
unhelpful to the applicability of the ABC test for determining Plaintiff's
employment status under the workers’ compensation exclusivity rule. The ABC
test, codified in Labor Code section 2775, does not rely on intentions or
contractual labels but instead focuses on specific criteria to classify a
worker as an independent contractor.
Under the ABC test,
Plaintiff must show that he was free from CarParts' control and direction, that
he performed work outside CarParts' usual course of business, and that he was
customarily engaged in an independently established trade. The argument set forth
in the moving papers fails to address these elements. As noted in the Court's
order, CarParts' control over Perez’s work is demonstrated by its enforcement
of safety standards and the imposition of order-picking quotas, indicating
substantial involvement in his day-to-day activities, which supports an
employment relationship. Additionally, Perez’s order-picking duties appear
central to CarParts' primary business, undermining any argument that his work
falls outside its usual operations. Finally, there is no indication that Perez
was customarily engaged in an independent trade or business separate from his
role with CarParts and nGroup.
Plaintiff's reliance on
Patterson v. Domino's Pizza (2014) 60 Cal.4th 474 and Nichols v.
Arthur Murray, Inc. (1967) 248 Cal.App.2d 610 is distinguishable and does
not apply here. Both cases were decided before the adoption of the ABC test and
focus on common law employment principles, which place significant weight on
contractual terms and the parties' intent. In Patterson, the court
examined a franchise relationship where the franchisor’s lack of control over
day-to-day employee operations was critical, whereas here, CarParts exercised
significant control over Perez’s work environment and tasks. Nichols
similarly evaluated the relationship based on contract terms and intent, an
approach that the ABC test specifically bypasses by concentrating on actual
work conditions rather than on the parties' descriptions.
Thus, the motion is
Denied.
