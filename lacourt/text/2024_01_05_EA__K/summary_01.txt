And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by the plaintiff, Juan Franco, to reconsider the court's previous order granting a motion to compel arbitration to Ford Motor Company (FMC) and Performance Ford. The plaintiff alleges that the 2016 Ford F-250 he purchased has various defects and was not repaired after a reasonable number of attempts. The court is declining to issue a ruling on the motion, citing procedural requirements, but will hear from the plaintiff at a post-arbitration status conference scheduled for January 5, 2024.
