  Case No.:  24STCV00465
 
  Hearing Date: May 2, 2024
 
[TENTATIVE] order RE:
Defendant Internet
  Truckstop Group, LLC’S demurrer to THE complaint



 
On January
8, 2024, Plaintiff Karla Huff (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action for
invasion of privacy against Defendant Internet
Truckstop Group, LLC (“Defendant”). On April 19, 2024, Plaintiff timely
filed a First Amended Complaint.
On March
28, 2024, Defendant filed a demurrer to the Complaint. Defendant’s Demurrer to
the Complaint is TAKEN OFF CALENDAR AS MOOT. Plaintiff is entitled to amend at
least once without leave of court before the answer or demurrer is filed; or if
a defendant files a demurrer, no later than when the opposition is due on the
hearing on the demurrer. (CCP § 472(a).) Moreover, an amended complaint
supersedes all prior complaints. (State Compensation Ins. Fund v. Superior
Court (2010) 184 Cal. App. 4th 1124, 1130-1131.) The amended complaint
furnishes the sole basis for the cause of action, and the original complaint
ceases to have any effect either as a pleading or as a basis for judgment. (Ibid.)
Since there is but one complaint in a civil action, the filing of an amended
complaint moots a motion directed to a prior complaint. (Ibid.) 
Plaintiff
filed a First Amended Complaint on April 19, 2024, when an opposition to
Defendant’s demurrer would have been due. Accordingly, the demurrer is moot as
it was directed to the original complaint.
CONCLUSIONS AND
ORDER 
The
Court finds that Plaintiff properly filed a First Amended Complaint.
Accordingly, Defendant’s Demurrer to the Complaint is now taken off calendar as
MOOT.
The
Moving Party is to give notice and file proof of service of such.
