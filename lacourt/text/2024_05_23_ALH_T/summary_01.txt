```

And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has ruled in favor of the plaintiff's motion for relief from waiver of jury trial. The plaintiff failed to timely pay jury fees, but the court finds that the waiver was inadvertent due to counsel's mistake. The defendant has filed a notice of non-opposition, so there will be no prejudice to the defendant. The non-jury trial scheduled for August 5, 2024 is now a jury trial.
