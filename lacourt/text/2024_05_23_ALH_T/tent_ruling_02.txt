II.        LEGAL
STANDARD
Standard for Compelling Interrogatories – Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §2030.290 provides that a
party may bring a motion to compel responses to interrogatories, where the
responding party failed to serve a timely response. Unless otherwise agreed,
the responding party is required to serve response within 30 days after service
of the interrogatories. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §2030.260.) “The party
propounding interrogatories and the responding party may agree to extend the
time for service of a response to a set of interrogatories, or to particular
interrogatories in a set, to a date beyond that provided in Section 2030.260.”
(Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.270(a).) While this agreement may be informal, it
must be confirmed in writing. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
2030.270(b).)  If the responding party fails to serve a timely
response, the party “any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories . . .” (Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. §2030.290(a).)  
Standard for Compelling Responses¿to
Requests for¿Production¿(“RFP”)¿–¿Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300 provides that a party may
bring a motion to compel responses to a request for production of documents,
where the responding party failed to serve a timely response. Unless otherwise
agreed, the responding party is required to serve response within 30 days after
service of the discovery demand for production documents. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc.
§ 2031.260(a).) If the responding party fails to serve a timely response, the
party “waives any objection to the demand, including one based on privilege or
on the protection for work product . . .” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300(a).)
The requesting party need not demonstrate “good cause to compel responses, nor
that it satisfied the “meet and confer” requirement. (Sinaiko¿Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants¿(2007) 143
Cal.App.4th¿390, 404.)
