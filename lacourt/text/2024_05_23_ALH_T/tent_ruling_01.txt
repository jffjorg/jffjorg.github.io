BACKGROUND
On April 24, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a notice of posting
jury fees. On April 25, 2024, Defendant filed an objection to the notice of
posting jury fees. 
On April 29, 2024, Plaintiffs filed this motion for
relief from waiver of jury trial. Defendant filed a notice of non-opposition. 
LEGAL STANDARD
CCP
section 631 provides that “[a]t least one party demanding a jury on each side
of a civil case shall pay a nonrefundable fee of one hundred fifty dollars
($150), unless the fee has been paid by another party on the same side of the
case.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 631(b).)  The fee must be paid before the
date scheduled for the initial case management conference in the action. 
(Id., § 631(c).)  If no case management conference is scheduled in
a civil action, the fee shall be due no later than 365 calendar days after the
filing of the initial complaint.  (Id., § 631(c)(2).)  A party
waives jury trial by failing to timely pay the fee, unless another party on the
same side of the case has paid that fee.  (Id., § 631(f)(5).) 
 
“The
court may, in its discretion upon just terms, allow a trial by jury although
there may have been a waiver of a trial by jury.”  (Id., §
631(g).)  “A trial court abuses its discretion as a matter of law when []
relief has been denied where there has been no prejudice¿to the other party or
to the court from an inadvertent waiver.”¿ (Tesoro del Valle Master
Homeowners Assn. v. Griffin¿(2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 619, 638.)  Policy
favors the court using its discretion to proceed with a jury trial.¿ (Bishop
v. Anderson¿(1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 821, 823.)¿ 
 
“Where
the right to jury is threatened, the crucial focus is whether any prejudice
will be suffered by any party or the court if¿a motion for relief from waiver
is granted. [Citations.]¿¿A trial court abuses its discretion as a matter of
law when ‘…relief has been denied where there has been no prejudice to the
other party or to the court from an inadvertent waiver. [Citations.]’”  (Wharton
v. Superior Court¿(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 100, 104.)¿¿“The mere fact that
trial will be by jury is not prejudice per se.”¿¿(Johnson-Stovall v.
Superior Court¿(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th¿808, 811 [prejudice not shown by need
to prepare motions¿in limine,
enlarged exhibits, and jury instructions unless inadequate time also
shown].)¿¿Rather, the prejudice that must be shown is “prejudice from the
granting of relief from waiver not prejudice from the jury trial.”¿¿(Winston
v. Superior Court¿(1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 600, 602, 603 [fact that it takes
longer to try a jury case is not prejudice from granting relief from
waiver].)   
DISCUSSION
Here, Plaintiff failed to timely pay jury
fees and thus waived trial by jury pursuant to CCP section 631(f). 
Plaintiffs assert the
waiver of jury trial was inadvertent and has submitted a declaration from their
counsel to support the assertion.  Plaintiff’s counsel states her
office inadvertently filed the jury fees untimely. 
(Avanesov Decl., ¶ 4.)  
The Court finds there is good cause to
permit relief from waiver of jury trial in this case because of counsel’s
inadvertent failure to timely post jury fees.  There will be no prejudice
to Defendant as Defendant filed a notice of non-opposition. 
CONCLUSION 
Plaintiffs’ motion for order granting
relief from waiver of jury trial is GRANTED.  The non-jury trial scheduled
for August 5, 2024 is now a jury trial.
 
Plaintiffs
are ordered to give notice of this ruling.
