And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Kind Shock's motion to quash the service of summons and cross-complaint on Kind Shock. The judge found that service on Kind Shock's Director of Operations, Rick Taylor, was proper because Taylor was authorized to receive service of process and Kind Shock does business in California. The judge also found that Kind Shock was given notice of the action in time to avoid default and that its insurer requested an extension of time to respond to the cross-complaint rather than timely moving to have the service quashed. The judge noted that Kind Shock's failure to file and serve its motion to quash until April 12, 2024, was untimely and may have been an attempt to avoid default.
