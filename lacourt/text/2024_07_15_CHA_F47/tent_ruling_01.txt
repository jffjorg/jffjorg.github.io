SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
Plaintiff Douglas Rewers (Plaintiff) alleges that, prior
to 7/31/19, he, Defendant David Rewers (David) and non-party Tuan Nguyen were
shareholders in Defendant Precise Die and Finishing, Inc. (PDF).  (Second Amended Complaint (SAC) ¶9).  Plaintiff alleges that on 7/31/19, David, PDF
and Plaintiff entered a written contract whereby David and PDF agreed to
purchase the ownership interest of Plaintiff in PDF for $140,000.  (Id. ¶11 and Ex.1 thereto).  Plaintiff alleges that while he has performed
under the contract defendants, meaning David and PDF, breached the
contract.  (SAC ¶¶10-12).  Plaintiff specifically alleges that he is not
making a claim for breach of contract against Monsour or Nguyen.  (SAC ¶10).
 
Plaintiff also alleges that PDF breached a separate contract
to pay him commissions on certain work he procured for the company.  (SAC ¶¶16-23).  Plaintiff also makes claims for breach of
fiduciary duty against David (SAC ¶¶29) and a claim for accounting against
David and PDF.     
 
On 2/16/22, Plaintiff filed this action for: (1) Breach
of Contract, (2) Fraud in the Inducement, (3) Breach of Fiduciary Duty and (4)
Accounting.  On 11/29/23, this Court
sustained Monsour’s demurrer to the complaint with 30 days leave to amend.  On 1/2/24, Plaintiff’s First Amended
Complaint was filed alleging causes of action for: (1) Breach of Contract
(against David and PDF), (2) Interference With Contract (against Monsour,
David, PDF and Doe defendants), (3) Breach of Fiduciary Duty (against David,
Monsour, PDF and Doe defendants), (4) Fraud In the Inducement/Fraud and
Misrepresentation (against David, Monsour, PDF and Doe defendants) and (5)
Accounting (against David, Monsour, PDF and Doe defendants).  
 
After meet and confer efforts failed to resolve the
issues David, PDF and Monsour (collectively, Defendants) had with the First
Amended Complaint, on 1/31/23, Defendants filed and served a  demurrer to the entire First Amended Complaint
and motion to strike the entire complaint and/or the allegations regarding and
the prayer for punitive damages.  On 4/8/24,
this Court sustained the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint with 30 days
leave to amend, denied the request to strike the entire First Amended Complaint
and otherwise placed the motion to strike off calendar due to the ruling on the
demurrer.  (See 4/8/24 Minute
Order).  
 
On 5/9/24, Plaintiff filed the subject Second Amended
Complaint, which was served on 5/8/24. 
The caption of the Second Amended Complaint lists the causes of action
as: (1) Breach of Contract; (2) Breach of Contract; (3) Breach of Fiduciary
Duty; (4) Fraud In the Inducement and (5) Accounting.  However, the body of the Second Amended
Complaint does not include a cause of action for Fraud In the Inducement and
the 4th cause action is actually for Accounting.  
 
After meet and confer efforts failed to resolve the
issues Defendants had with the Second Amended Complaint, on 6/12/24, Defendants
filed and served the instant demurer to the entire Second Amended Complaint and
motion to strike which seeks to strike the entire Second Amended
Complaint.  On 7/1/24, Plaintiff filed a
request to dismiss Munna Monsour without prejudice from the complaint which was
entered the same day.  Also, on 7/1/24,
Plaintiff filed and served oppositions to the demurrer and motion to strike.  On 7/8/24, Defendants filed replies to the
oppositions.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
Procedural Defects   
 
(1) As noted above, on 4/8/24, this Court sustained
Defendants’ demurrer to the First Amended Complaint with 30 days leave to amend
which made the amended pleading due on or before 5/8/24 (excluding the first
day, 4/8/24, and including the last, 5/8/24, 30 days from 4/8/24 is 5/8/24).  (See 4/8/24 Minute Order); CRC
1.10(a).  Plaintiff did not file the Second
Amended Complaint until 5/9/24.  However,
the Second Amended Complaint was served on 5/8/24.  
As such, the Court finds that the late filing of the Second
Amended Complaint did not prejudice Defendants. 
Therefore, Defendants’ request to strike the Second Amended Complaint
because it was filed beyond the deadline set forth in the Court’s 4/8/24 Minute
Order is denied.  
 
(2) Defendants failed to provide proper notice of the
alternative request to strike allegations regarding punitive damages from the
Second Amended Complaint.  CRC 3.1322(a)
provides:
 
“A notice of motion to strike a
portion of a pleading must quote in full the portions sought to be stricken
except where the motion is to strike an entire paragraph, cause of action,
count, or defense. Specifications in a notice must be numbered consecutively.”
 
Here, the notice of the motion to strike does not quote
any portion of the Second Amended Complaint Defendants seek to have stricken
and does not even mention that, in the alternative to striking the entire
Second Amended Complaint, Defendants seek to have portions of the Second
Amended Complaint relating to punitive damages stricken.  (See Motion to Strike, p.1:26-p.2:15).

 
(3) Defendants refer to a Request for Judicial Notice
purportedly filed with the Demurrer; however, no Request for Judicial Notice
filed by Defendants appears in eCourt.  (See
Demurrer, p.8:20-24).
 
Substantive Arguments
 
Due to the dismissal of Monsour, the demurrer and motion
to strike as to Monsour is moot.
 
Defendants have demurred to each of the causes of action
in the Second Amended Complaint on the grounds that they fail to allege
sufficient facts to state a cause of action and/or are uncertain.   CCP
430.10(e), (f); (See Notice of Demurrer, p.2:18-p.3:6; Demurrer
Memorandum of Points & Authorities, p.3:11-15).
 
1st cause of action – Breach of Contract
 
Contrary to Defendants’ assertion, the Second Amended
Complaint sufficiently alleges the necessary elements (contract, plaintiff’s
performance or excuse for nonperformance, breach by defendants, and resulting
damages) to state a breach of contract claim against David and PDF based on the
agreement attached to the Second Amended Complaint as Exhibit 1.  The allegations are also sufficiently clear
for Defendants to be able to respond to the claim.    
 
2nd cause of action – Breach of Contract
 
Plaintiff has also alleged sufficient facts to state a
breach of contract cause of action against PDF for breach of an alleged
agreement to pay commissions to Plaintiff. 
While the Second Amended Complaint does not allege whether the
underlying contract was written, oral or implied by conduct, Defendants have
not demurred to the cause of action on such ground.  See CCP 430.10(g); (Demurrer,
generally).  
Plaintiff has sufficiently set forth the terms of the
alleged agreement, his performance, PDF’s breach and damages Plaintiff suffered
as a result of the breach.  Additionally,
the Court finds that the addition of this breach of contract claim falls within
scope of the order granting Plaintiff leave to amend after the sustaining of
the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint as the First Amended Complaint also
included allegations regarding PDF’s failure to pay commissions owed to
Plaintiff.  (See FAC ¶¶3, 15, 18,
21, 26-29, 31-36); Harris (2010) 185 CA4th 1018, 1023.  
 
Defendants have also failed to establish as a matter of
law that the claims/damages sought in the 2nd cause of action were
released by the agreement which forms the basis of the 1st cause of
action (i.e., that they did occur after the execution of that agreement).    
 
3rd cause of action – Breach of Fiduciary
Duty
 
The elements of a breach of fiduciary duty cause of
action are: (1) the existence of a fiduciary relationship, (2) breach of
fiduciary duty, and (3) damages.  Shopoff
& Cavallo LLP (2008) 167 CA4th 1489, 1509; Oasis West Realty, LLC
(2011) 51 C4th 811, 820-821; Knutson (2018) 25 CA5th 1075, 1094.
 
Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged the claim as against
David.  Plaintiff has alleged that he is
making a claim for breach of fiduciary duty against David, as a majority
shareholder in PDF, based on his alleged actions to oust Plaintiff from PDF,
failure to pay the agreed upon buy-out price and failure to pay commissions
earned by Plaintiff.  (See SAC ¶¶24,
29).
 
4th cause of action - Accounting 
 
The elements of an accounting cause of action are: (1) a
relationship between plaintiff and defendant that requires an accounting and
(2) that some balance is due the plaintiff that can only be ascertained by an
accounting.  Teselle (2009) 173
CA4th 156, 179.
 
Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to state a claim
for accounting against David and PDF based on the relationship between the
parties, the agreement which forms the basis of the 2nd cause of
action and Defendants’ failure to pay the amounts allegedly owed to Plaintiff
under such agreement.  
 
Sanctions
 
The Court does not find that Plaintiff’s conduct in
including Monsour as a defendant and failing to dismiss him until 7/1/24
constitutes sanctionable conduct under CCP 128.5 or CCP 128.7.  See CCP 128.5(a), (b); CCP 128.7(b).  Even if sanctions were warranted, Defendants
failed to properly request the imposition of sanctions under CCP 128.5 or CCP
128.7 (i.e., a separate motion was not filed; the sanctionable conduct is not
entirely clear (is it naming Monsour at all or failing to dismiss Monsour
earlier); the safe-harbor period was not provided).  See CCP 128.5(f)(1)(A), (B); CCP 128.7(c)(1).

 
CONCLUSION
 
The demurrer and motion to strike as to Munna Monsour is placed
off calendar as moot due to the dismissal of Monsour from the complaint on
7/1/24.
 
The request to strike the entire Second Amended Complaint
because it was untimely filed is denied. 
The alternative request to strike allegations regarding punitive damages
from the Second Complaint is also denied as it was not properly noticed.
 
The demurrer is overruled.  Answer/s from David Rewers and Precise Die
& Finishing, Inc. are due within 20 days.
 
The request for sanctions is denied.
