[1] The
court notes that, on September 19, 2024, plaintiff Veronica Martinez filed a
document entitled “Plaintiff’s Opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Quash
Service of Summons and Complaint.” 
However, that appears to be an opposition to the ex parte application for
leave to notice the motion to quash.  (See,
e.g., Sep. 19, 2024 Opp., p. 2:4-11 [arguing that the ex parte does not satisfy
the requirement of irreparable harm].) 
Moreover, the motion to quash was not filed until September 23, 2024.  The court advanced the hearing on this motion
to November 19, 2024 on October 8, 2024. 
(Oct. 8, 2024 Minute Order, p. 2.) 
Plaintiff Veronica Martinez was ordered to, but did not, give notice of
the court’s order.  (Ibid.) 


[2] The
Second September 19, 2024 proof of service differs from the First September 19,
2024 proof of service in that the Second September 19, 2024 proof of service
states that Defendant, through “Rebecca Vang, Authorized to Accept Service of
Process for CSC Lawyers, Inc. – Agent for Service of Process[,]” was personally
served with the summons and complaint on September 16, 2024.  (Second Sep. 19, 2024 POS-010, ¶¶ 2-5.)


[3] As
set forth above, Plaintiff did not file an opposition to this motion.  However, the court notes that, in opposition
to Defendant’s ex parte application, Plaintiff appears to concede that the
August 27, 2024 proof of service is defective. 
( Sep. 19, 2024 Opp., pp. 5:15-17 [“Although an error was made while
filling out the original Proof of Service that was filed with the Court on
August 27, 2024 . . . , the error has been corrected, and the corrected amended
Proof of Service was filed with the court on September 19, 2024”], 5:18-19 [the
declarant erroneously marked the box for substituted, rather than personal,
service].)
