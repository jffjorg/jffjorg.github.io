And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving plaintiff Ulysses Noriega and defendant General Motors LLC. The plaintiff moved the court to compel defendant to comply with a January 5, 2024 order and for sanctions. The court has denied the plaintiff's request for an order compelling defendant to comply with the January 5, 2024 order, but has granted the motion in part by ordering defendant to serve verifications to its supplemental responses and to produce certain documents in response to demands. The court has also denied the plaintiff's request for prospective monetary sanctions. The court has modified its January 5, 2024 order to remove an order requiring defendant to serve a further response to a certain demand and to correct the order to state that defendant shall serve a further response to a different demand. The court has ordered plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
