And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motion to quash the service of summons and complaint is granted. The court found that the plaintiff failed to meet its burden to show that the service of summons and complaint was valid. Specifically, the court found that the proof of service was defective because it did not state that the summons and complaint were mailed to the defendant after substituted service. Additionally, the court found that the person identified in the proof of service as serving the defendant was not the defendant's agent for service of process. Therefore, the court orders that the service on the defendant, as described in the proofs of service of summons filed with the court on August 27, 2024, and September 19, 2024, at 11:15 a.m., is quashed.
