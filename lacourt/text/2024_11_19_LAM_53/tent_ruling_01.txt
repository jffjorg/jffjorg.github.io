  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion to compel compliance with
  january 5, 2024 order and for sanctions
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Ulysses Noreiga       
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant General Motors LLC
Motion to Compel Compliance with January 5, 2024 Order and for
Sanctions
The court considered the moving and opposition papers filed in
connection with this motion.  
The court did not consider the reply papers filed on November 15, 2024
because they were not filed and served at least 5 court days before the hearing
on this motion.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
1005, subd. (b).) 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Ulysses Noriega (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order
(1) compelling defendant General Motors LLC (“Defendant”) to comply with the
court’s January 5, 2024 order within five days, and (2) ordering prospective
sanctions of $500 per day for each day thereafter that Defendant does not
comply with the order compelling its compliance. 
First, the court denies Plaintiff’s request for an order that
Defendant comply with the court’s January 5, 2024 order.
Second, the court finds that (1) Plaintiff has shown that Defendant did
not fully comply with the court’s January 5, 2024 order because Defendant (i)
did not verify its supplemental responses as required, (ii) did not comply in
full as to demand number 25 as ordered by the court,[1]
(iii) did not produce responsive Information Service Bulletins and Technical
Service Bulletins in response to demand number 16, and instead produced lists
thereof only, and (iv) did not produce customer complaints in response to
demand number 21 and instead identified documents relating to Technical Service
Bulletins and recalls, which are not responsive to that demand, and (2) to
address the harm suffered by Plaintiff as a result of Defendant’s noncompliance
with the court’s order, it is appropriate to order that Defendant (i) serve
verifications to its supplemental responses, and (ii) produce the documents
described above.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.250, subd. (a) [“The party to whom the demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed shall sign the response under oath unless the
response contains only objections”]; Choderker Decl., Ex. 2, Def. Responses;
Jan. 5, 2024 Order, pp. 2:25-3:2, 3:7-10.) 
The court notes that Plaintiff has argued that Defendant’s responses
are insufficient because they do not state that a diligent search and
reasonable inquiry has been made in an effort to comply with the demand.  (Mot., pp. 7:15-20, 8:7-9.)  But (1) such a statement is required only if
the responding party has represented its inability to comply, and (2) Defendant
has made statements of compliance in response to the subject demands.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.230 [“A
representation of inability to comply with the particular demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling shall affirm that a diligent search
and a reasonable inquiry has been made in an effort to comply with that
demand”] [emphasis added], 2031.220 [statement of compliance requirements]; Choderker
Decl., Ex. 2, Def. Responses, pp. 2:20-24, 4:1-3, 5:5-13, 6:15-17, 8:1-10,
9:4-13, 10:8-10, 11:11-13, 12:12-15, 13:9-13, 14:5-9, 15:8-10, 16:2-4, 17:2-4.)
 Moreover, while Plaintiff argues that
Defendant did not produce Failure Mode and Effects Documents relating to
battery defects in response to demand number 25, Plaintiff did not cite
evidence or present argument establishing that those documents exist and are in
Defendant’s possession, custody, or control. 
(Mot., p. 9:18-23.)  
The court further notes that Plaintiff has argued that Defendant did
not serve a further response to Request for Production of Documents, number
26.  The court acknowledges that its
January 5, 2024 order orders Defendant to serve a supplemental response to that
demand.  (Jan. 5, 2024 Order, p.
3:2.)  This appears to be a typographical
error because (1) Plaintiff did not move to compel a further response to this
demand, and (2) the court did not, in the body of the order, grant Plaintiff’s
motion to compel a further response to number 26.  (Pl. Not. of Mot. to Compel Further
Responses, p. 1:2-7; Jan. 5, 2024 Order, p. 2.)  Instead, the order should have compelled
Defendant’s further response to number 56. 
(Jan. 5, 2024 Order, p. 2:5-7 [granting motion as to numbers 7, 25, and
56].) 
Third, the court denies Plaintiff’s request for prospective monetary
sanctions. 
ORDER
            The court grants in part plaintiff
Ulyssess Noriega’s motion to compel compliance and for sanctions as follows. 
            The court orders defendant General
Motors LLC (1) to serve on plaintiff Ulysses Noreiga verifications to defendant
General Motors LLC’s supplemental responses to plaintiff Ulysses Noreiga’s
Requests for Production of Documents, served on February 13, 2024, and (2) to
produce to plaintiff Ulyssess Noreiga (i) all documents and things that are in
defendant General Motors LLC’s possession, custody, or control, which are
responsive to Requests for Production of Documents, number 25, (ii) all Information
Service Bulletins and Technical Service that are in defendant General Motors
LLC’s possession, custody, or control and that defendant General Motors LLC
identified in response to Requests for Production of Documents, number 16, and
(iii) customer complaints relating to defects alleged in the First Amended
Complaint in vehicles purchased in California for the same year, make, and
model of the subject vehicle, which are responsive to Requests for Production
number 21 and are in defendant General Motors LLC’s possession, custody, or
control, within 20 days of the date of this order. 
            The court denies plaintiff Ulyssess
Noriega’s request for prospective monetary sanctions against defendant General
Motors LLC. 
            The court orders that its January 5,
2024 order is modified (1) to remove the order that defendant General Motors
LLC shall serve a further response to Requests for Production of Documents,
number 26, and (2) to correct the order to state that defendant General Motors
LLC shall serve a further response to Requests for Production of Documents,
number 56.
            The court orders plaintiff Ulyssess
Noriega to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
