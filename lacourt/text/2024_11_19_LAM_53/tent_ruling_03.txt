MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant Public Health
Foundation Enterprises, Inc., d/b/a Heluna Health    
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to Quash Service of Summons
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed.[1]

DISCUSSION
Defendant Public Health Foundation Enterprises, Inc., d/b/a Heluna
Health (“Defendant”) moves the court for an order quashing service of the
summons and complaint by plaintiff Veronica Martinez (“Plaintiff”) on the
ground that service of process was defective. 
As a threshold matter, the court notes that Defendant’s notice of
motion does not specify which proofs of service are the subject of this
motion.  Plaintiff has filed three proofs
of service of summons and complaint with the court: (1) on August 27, 2024, which
states that Defendant was served by substituted service on August 12, 2024; (2)
on September 19, 2024, at 11:15 a.m., which states that Defendant was served by
personal service on August 12, 2024 (the “First September 19, 2024 proof of
service”); and (3) on September 19, 2024, at 11:22 a.m., which states that
Defendant was served by personal service on September 16, 2024 (the “Second
September 19, 2024 proof of service”).  It
appears that Defendant has only moved to quash service of the summons and
complaint on August 12, 2024, as stated in the August 27, 2024 and First
September 19, 2024 proofs of service. 
(Mot., pp. 5:2-26 [arguing that the August 27, 2024 proof of service is
defective], 6:1-27 [arguing that the First September 19, 2024 proof of service
is defective]; Kaplan Decl., Exs. A [August 27, 2024 proof of service], B
[First September 19, 2024 proof of service, filed at 11:15 a.m.].)  Defendant’s moving papers neither address the
Second September 19, 2024 proof of service nor argue that service, as described
therein, is invalid. 
Thus, the court does not discuss whether the Second September 19, 2024
proof of service establishes valid service of the summons and complaint on
Defendant.[2]

“A defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time to plead or
within any further time that the court may for good cause allow, may serve and
file a notice of motion for one or more of the following purposes: [¶] (1) To
quash service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over
him or her.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §¿418.10, subd. (a)(1).)  “When a defendant argues that service of
summons did not bring him or her within the trial court’s jurisdiction, the
plaintiff has ‘the burden of proving the facts that did give the court jurisdiction,
that is the facts requisite to an effective service.’”  (American Express Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011)
199 Cal.App.4th 383, 387.)
First, the court finds that Plaintiff has not met her burden to show
that the August 27, 2024 proof of service establishes valid service of the
summons and Complaint on Defendant.  (American
Express Centurion Bank, supra, 199 Cal.App.4th at p. 387.)
The August 27, 2024 proof of service (1) was not completed by a
registered process server, such that there is not a presumption of the facts
stated therein, and (2) states that Defendant, through “Becky Degeorge—Agent
for Service of Process” was served with the summons and complaint “by
substituted service” on August 12, 2024 by leaving the documents with “Jennifer
Doe-Person Apparently in Charge at the front Desk.”  (Evid. Code, §¿647; Fernandes v. Singh (2017)
16 Cal.App.5th 932, 940 [“The return of a registered process server
‘establishes a presumption, affecting the burden of producing evidence,
of the facts stated in the return’”] [emphasis in original]; Aug. 27, 2024
POS-010, ¶¶ 2-3, 5, subd. (b)(1), 7, subd. (e)(1).)  
The court finds that the proof of service is defective and therefore
invalid and insufficient to establish service on Defendant because substituted
service requires that the process server, after leaving the summons and
complaint at the designated location, “thereafter mail[] a copy of the summons
and of the complaint by first-class mail, postage prepaid to the person to be
served at the place where a copy of the summons and complaint were left[,]” but
the proof of service does not state that the summons and complaint were mailed
to Defendant.[3]  (Aug. 27, 2024 POS-010, ¶ 5 [leaving blank
service by mail]; Code Civ. Proc., § 415.20, subd. (a).) 
Second, the court finds that Plaintiff has not met her burden to show
that the First September 19, 2024 proof of service establishes valid service of
the summons and Complaint on Defendant.  (American Express Centurion Bank, supra,
199 Cal.App.4th at p. 387.)
The First September 19, 2024 proof of service (1) was not completed by
a registered process server, such that there is not a presumption of the facts
stated therein, and (2) states that Defendant was personally served on August
12, 2024 by delivery of the summons and complaint to “Jennifer-Person in charge
at front desk.”  (First September 19,
2024 POS-010, ¶¶ 2-3, 5, subd. (a); Evid. Code, § 647; Fernandes, supra,
16 Cal.App.5th at p. 940.)  
“A summons may be served on a corporation by delivering a copy of the
summons and complaint” to, inter alia, the person designated as an agent
for service of process or to the president, chief executive officer, or other
head of the corporation, a vice president, a secretary or assistant secretary,
a treasurer or assistant treasurer, a controller or chief financial officer, a
general manager, or a person authorized by the corporation to receive service
of process.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 416.10,
subds. (a), (b).)  Defendant has
presented evidence establishing that the person identified in the First
September 19, 2024 proof of service, Jennifer Mendez-Valencia, is not
Defendant’s agent for service of process and does not hold any of the positions
identified in section 416.10, subdivision (b). 
(Seifert Decl., ¶ 8 [“Jennifer Mendez-Valencia has never been designated
as an agent for the service of process by” Defendant]; Mendez-Valencia Decl.,
¶¶ 2 [“I have never been designated by [Defendant] as an agent for service of
process], 3 [“I have never held a position as the president, chief executive
officer, or other head of [Defendant], nor as a vice president, a secretary or
assistant secretary, a treasurer or assistant treasurer, a controller or chief
financial officer, a general manager, nor as a [] person authorized by
[Defendant] to receive service of process”], 5 [Mendez-Valencia is part of
Defendant’s administrative staff].)  
Plaintiff did not file an opposition to this motion disputing this
evidence or otherwise arguing that service has been effected on Defendant.  Thus, the court finds that Plaintiff has not
met her burden to establish that service of the summons and Complaint on
Defendant, as described in the First September 19, 2024 proof of service, was
valid.  
            The court therefore grants
Defendant’s motion.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
418.10, subd. (a)(1).) 
ORDER
            The court grants defendant Public
Health Foundation Enterprises, Inc., d/b/a Heluna Health’s motion to quash
service of summons.
            The court orders that service on
Defendant Public Health Foundation Enterprises, Inc., d/b/a Heluna Health, as
described in the proofs of service of summons filed with the court on August
27, 2024, and September 19, 2024, at 11:15 a.m., is quashed.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10, subd. (a)(1).)
            The court orders defendant Public
Health Foundation Enterprises, Inc., d/b/a Heluna Health to give notice of this
ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
