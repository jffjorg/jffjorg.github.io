And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court notes that plaintiff Veronica Martinez filed an opposition to the ex parte application for leave to notice the motion to quash, but did not file an opposition to the motion to quash itself. The motion to quash was filed on September 23, 2024, and the court advanced the hearing on this motion to November 19, 2024 on October 8, 2024. Plaintiff was ordered to give notice of the court's order, but did not do so. The court also notes that the second proof of service filed on September 19, 2024 states that defendant was personally served with the summons and complaint on September 16, 2024. Additionally, plaintiff appears to concede that the August 27, 2024 proof of service is defective, and an error was corrected in the amended proof of service filed on September 19, 2024.
