And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in response to Ford's Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories. The Court finds that Ford has sufficiently met and conferred with Plaintiff in good faith prior to filing the motion. The Court grants Ford's motion, ordering Plaintiff to provide further responses to Special Interrogatories Nos. 24-54 and 47-62, as well as to identify the documents that support the facts identified in the interrogatories. The Court also tentatively grants Ford's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $560, pending oral argument on the meet-and-confer issues. Plaintiff's further responses are due to Defendant Ford on or before October 11, 2024.

The Court notes that the parties' meet-and-confer efforts were disputed, with Plaintiff arguing that Ford failed to meet and confer in good faith. However, the Court finds that Ford sufficiently met and conferred with Plaintiff prior to filing the motion. The Court also notes that the parties' discovery efforts will need to be coordinated and cooperative going forward.

The Court's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300, which provides that a party may move for an order compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that an answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete. The Court also relied on California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345, which requires that all motions or responses involving further discovery contain a separate statement with the text of each request, the response, and a statement of factual and legal reasons for compelling further responses.
