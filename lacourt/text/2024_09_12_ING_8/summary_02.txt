And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendants' motions to compel the plaintiff's responses to discovery requests. The plaintiff was injured in a vehicle collision on September 12, 2021, and filed a complaint against the defendants alleging causes of action for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence. The defendants served discovery requests on the plaintiff, but the plaintiff failed to respond. The defendants then filed motions to compel the plaintiff's responses, and the plaintiff did not file an opposition. The judge found that the plaintiff has entirely failed to respond to the discovery requests and granted the motions to compel. The plaintiff is ordered to provide code-compliant, verified responses to the defendants' propounded discovery by October 11, 2024.
