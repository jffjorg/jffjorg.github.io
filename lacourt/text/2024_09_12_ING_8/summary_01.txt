As for the summary, here is a brief summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment and the motion to quash deposition subpoenas. The court has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment on all six causes of action, finding that the plaintiff has failed to establish a triable issue of material fact. The court has also overruled the plaintiff's objection to the defendant's notice of motion to quash deposition ruling. The court has also found that the plaintiff's argument that Zion Bank would have issued a loan commitment by October 30, 2020 is speculative and not supported by the evidence. The court has scheduled a hearing for January 27, 2025 to consider the motion for summary judgment and the motion to quash deposition subpoenas.
