1.     
County of Los
Angeles’ Demurrer to Complaint  
 
 
TENTATIVE RULING

County of Los Angeles’ Demurrer to Complaint is
sustained with 20 days leave to amend.  
 
Background
 
Plaintiff’s Complaint was filed on December 27, 2022.
Plaintiff alleges the following facts. Plaintiff was being transported by
Defendant Westmed Ambulance. She was injured when her leg struck an object.
Plaintiff alleges the following causes of action: 1. Negligence; 2. Negligence;
3. Medical Malpractice.  
 
            Meet and Confer
             
            Defendant filed a meet and confer
declaration in sufficient compliance with CCP § 430.41.  (Decl., Lusine Arshakyan.) 
 
            Demurrer

A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a
complaint as a matter of law and raises only questions of law. (Schmidt v.
Foundation Health (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706.)  In testing the sufficiency of the complaint,
the court must assume the truth of (1) the properly pleaded factual
allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably inferred from those expressly
pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39
Cal.3d 311, 318.)  The Court may not
consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law.  (Moore v. Conliffe (1994) 7 Cal.App.4th
634, 638.) Because a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of a complaint, the
plaintiff must show that the complaint alleges facts sufficient to establish
every element of each cause of action.  (Rakestraw
v. California Physicians Service (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.)  Where the complaint fails to state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action, courts should sustain the demurrer.
 (C.C.P., § 430.10(e); Zelig v. County
of Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.App.4th 1112, 1126.)
Sufficient facts are the essential facts
of the case "with reasonable precision and with particularity sufficiently
specific to acquaint the defendant with the nature, source, and extent of his
cause of action.”  (Gressley v.
Williams (1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643-644.) "Whether the plaintiff will be able to
prove the pleaded facts is irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer."  (Stevens v. Superior Court (1986) 180
Cal.App.3d 605, 609–610.)  Under Code
Civil Procedure § 430.10(f), a demurrer may also be sustained if a complaint is
“uncertain.” Uncertainty exists where a
complaint’s factual allegations are so confusing they do not sufficiently
apprise a defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet.  (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp.
(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)
Defendant demurs to the second and third
causes of action for failure to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of
action. 
Second Cause of
Action for Negligence
            Third Cause of Action for Medical
Malpractice

            Defendant’s demurrer to the second
and third causes of action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend. Plaintiff
fails to state facts sufficient to state a cause of action. 
 
            First, Plaintiff alleges a mere
conclusion that Westmed and/or its employees were agents or employees of
demurring Defendant. No underlying facts to support any such conclusion have
been alleged. Second, even assuming arguendo that sufficient facts of agency
had been alleged, Plaintiff has not alleged the requisite facts to state a
cause of action.
 
            Health & Saf. Code, § 1799.107(b)
states: “Except as provided in Article 1 (commencing with Section 17000) of
Chapter 1 of Division 9 of the Vehicle Code, neither a public entity nor
emergency rescue personnel shall be liable for any injury caused by an action
taken by the emergency rescue personnel acting within the scope of their
employment to provide emergency services, unless the action taken was performed
in bad faith or in a grossly negligent manner.” 
 
Here, Plaintiff has failed to allege facts that any
acts undertaken by emergency personnel were performed in bad faith or in a
grossly negligent manner. Instead, the factual allegations merely set forth
accusations of negligence.
 
            Therefore, the demurrer to the
second and third causes of action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend. 
 
Defendant is ordered to give notice of
this ruling.
