And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for sanctions, which sought to strike the complaint and dismiss it with prejudice, as well as impose monetary sanctions of $4,335.00 against the plaintiff and her counsel. The defendant claimed that the complaint was filed primarily for an improper purpose and lacks evidentiary support, but the judge found that the plaintiff's potential belief at the time that the driver was not at fault does not necessarily establish an absolute defense. The judge noted that the plaintiff is entitled to conduct further investigation and discovery to determine if the driver or any other agents or employees of the defendant was at fault for the incident. The judge also pointed out that the defendant's reliance on a conclusory and unsworn statement by the plaintiff does not provide a basis for liability at this stage in the litigation.
