I.           
INTRODUCTION
This
action arises from a motor vehicle accident which occurred on September 6,
2019. On August 24, 2021, Plaintiffs George Uribe and William Rodriguez, a
minor by and through his guardian ad litem Angelica Uribe (“Plaintiffs”)
filed a complaint against Defendants Andrea Vincent and Gilberto Chavez
(collectively, “Defendants”), as well as Does 1 to 25, alleging a single cause
of action for motor vehicle. 
On
October 29, 2021, Defendants filed an answer to the complaint. 
On
February 6, 2023, the Court entered an order and stipulation which continued
trial from February 21, 2023, to October 26, 2023. 
On
September 21, 2023, Defendants filed the instant motion for an order to
continue all discovery and motion cutoff dates to be based on the current trial
date at the time the motion is being heard. 

On
September 25, 2023, Defendants filed an ex parte application to continue
the trial date and all pre-trial related deadlines. On September 27, 2023, the
Court granted Defendants’ ex parte application and continued trial from
October 26, 2023, to March 14, 2024. (09/27/23 Minute Order.) The Court noted that
it could not “continue or reopen discovery by ex parte application. Counsel has
a hearing date scheduled for 1/22/24 to compel an IME.” (09/27/23 Minute
Order.) The Court stated that “because the Court cannot reopen or continue
discovery deadlines, the discovery deadlines remain tied to the current, not
the new trial date.” (09/27/23 Minute Order.) The Court advised Defendants that
they could file a noticed motion to reopen discovery. (09/27/23 Minute Order.) 
Initially,
the Court notes that Defendants have not filed a motion to compel IME. 
On
January 8, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an opposition to Defendants’ motion, to which
Defendants replied on January 12, 2024. 
Initially, the Court finds that Defendants
have satisfied the meet and confer requirement pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. §
2025.450. (Gonter Decl., ¶ 5.) 
 
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARD
“[A]ny party shall be entitled as a
matter of right to complete discovery proceedings on or before the 30th day,
and to have motions concerning discovery heard on or before the 15th day,
before the date initially set for the trial of the action.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2024.020, subd. (a).) “Except as provided in Code Civ. Proc. § 2024.050, a
continuance or postponement of the trial date does not operate to reopen
discovery proceedings.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (b).)
 “On
motion of any party, the court may grant leave to complete discovery
proceedings, or to have a motion concerning discovery heard, closer to the initial
trial date, or to reopen discovery after a new trial date has been set.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2024.050, subd. (a).)  Code
Civ. Proc. § 2024.050 specifically allows a discovery motion to be heard after
the discovery motion cutoff date. (Pelton-Shepherd Industries, Inc. v. Delta
Packaging Products, Inc. (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1568, 1586.) 
In assessing a motion brought under
Code Civ. Proc. § 2024.050, a court considers the following factors: (1) the
necessity and the reasons for discovery; (2) the diligence or lack of diligence
of the party seeking the discovery or the hearing of a discovery motion, and
the reasons that the discovery was not completed or that the discovery motion
was not heard earlier; (3) any likelihood that permitting the discovery or
hearing the discovery motion will prevent the case from going to trial on the
date set, or otherwise interfere with the trial calendar, or result in
prejudice to any other party; and (4) the length of time that has elapsed
between any date previously set, and the date presently set, for the trial of
the action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.050, subd. (b)(1)-(4).) 
A court has discretion on whether to
grant a motion to reopen or continue discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.050,
subd. (b).) “In law and motion practice, factual evidence is supplied to the
court by way of declarations.” (Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Superior
Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, 224.) Good cause must be shown to reopen
discovery. (Beverly Hospital v. Superior Court (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th
1289, 1293.) 
 
III.       
DISCUSSION
Defendants contend that crucial
discovery steps still need to be completed including deposing relevant fact and
medical witnesses, conducting an IME, and obtaining relevant medical records.
(Motion, 5:24-26.) Plaintiffs assert that Defendants’ claimed necessity and
reasons for discovery is a misrepresentation to the Court. (Opposition, 3:22-23.)
The crux of Defendants’ motion is that they seek an order extending discovery
for the purpose of conducting an IME. 
Declaration of Defendants’ Counsel 
Defendants provide the declaration of
their counsel K. Robert Gonter (“Gonter”) in support of the motion. Defendants
have retained Dr. Scott K. Forman, a board-certified orthopedic surgeon, to
conduct a medical physical examination of Plaintiff William Rodriguez
(“Rodriguez”) and served an IME notice on September 6, 2023. (Gonter Decl., ¶¶
3, 12; Exhibit A.) Plaintiffs are alleging injuries arising from a motor
vehicle accident which occurred on September 6, 2019. (Gonter Decl., ¶ 2.) The
first available date for an IME with Dr. Forman was not until October 26, 2023,
which was after the discovery cutoff. (Gonter Decl., ¶ 4.) Defendants timely
served a notice of physical examination on Plaintiff Rodriguez on September 6,
2023, but Dr. Forman was not available until after the discovery cutoff to
evaluate Plaintiff Rodriguez. (Gonter Decl., ¶ 7.) Counsel states that
Defendants do not control Dr. Forman’s calendar or his medical practice.
(Gonter Decl., ¶ 7.) 
Counsel attests that at the time of the
motion, trial was set for October 26, 2023, and discovery and motion cutoff
deadlines were to be completed by September 26, 2023. (Gonter Decl., ¶ 8.) Counsel
states that crucial discovery steps still need to be completed including
deposing relevant fact and medical witnesses, conducting an IME, and obtaining
relevant medical records. (Gonter Decl., ¶ 15.) The outstanding discovery is
crucial to the defense and there is a compelling need to extend or reopen
discovery. (Gonter Decl., ¶¶ 16, 18.) 
Declaration of Plaintiffs’ Counsel
In opposition to the Motion, Plaintiffs’
counsel Anthony M. Crisci (“Crisci”) declares that Plaintiff Rodriguez served
verified discovery responses, including document production, on December 20,
2021. (Crisci Decl., ¶ 3.) Counsel indicates that all medical records pertaining
to this action were included in such responses, and counsel’s office did not
object to any subpoenas which were served to all medical facilities where
Plaintiff Rodriguez sought treatment. (Crisci Decl., ¶ 3.) Counsel is unclear
on what medical records Defendants are now claiming they need. (Crisci Decl., ¶
3.) Counsel states that Defendants refuse to meet and confer regarding deposition
dates for Defendants’ six designated expert witnesses. (Crisci Decl., ¶ 4;
Exhibit A.)  
Analysis
Ultimately, the issue here comes down
to diligence vs. need.  Defendants have
clearly not been diligent; they had almost two years from the time they
received information regarding Plaintiff Rodriguez’s injuries to schedule an
independent medical examination.  They failed
to schedule that examination until the last minute, resulting in the doctor
they chose to perform that examination being unavailable until after the
discovery cut-off.  (It is unclear to the
Court why Defendants did not find another doctor to provide the examination prior
to the discovery cut-off.)  
Defendants contend that despite their
apparent lack of diligence, they have a significant need for the medical
examination and will be highly prejudiced without it.  Realistically, however, that is prejudice of
their own making.  It is hard to find
that such prejudice, then, outweighs the lack of diligence.
Moreover, reopening discovery would
likely cause a delay in trial. Trial is currently scheduled to commence on
March 14, 2024. Defendants’ position is that they need to depose “relevant fact
and medical witnesses, conduct[] an IME, and obtain[] relevant medical records.”
(Motion, 5:24-26.) If the Court were to extend the discovery deadline, such
deadline would expire on February 14, 2024. The Court fails to see the
likelihood of Defendants completing all their purported outstanding discovery
by such date. Defendants even concede that they have no control over Dr.
Forman’s calendar or medical practice. Thus, it is possible that an IME of
Plaintiff—and the depositions of witnesses and obtaining medical records—would
occur after any extended discovery cutoff date based on the March 14, 2024
trial date. 
In sum, the Court finds that Defendants
have not been diligent in seeking discovery as they fail to present reasons why
discovery was not completed earlier. The Court finds that reopening discovery
would likely prevent the case from going to trial on March 14, 2024.  
Accordingly, the Court is inclined to exercise
its discretion under Code Civ. Proc. § 2024.050 and DENY Defendants’ motion to continue
all discovery and motion cutoff dates. 
However, before doing so, the Court will hear from Defendants regarding
what specific discovery they believe they can do without moving the trial date.
