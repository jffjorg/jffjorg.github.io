Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a demurrer filed by the plaintiff, John Merriett, to the answer filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. (Uber). The plaintiff argues that Uber's answer does not state facts sufficient to constitute a defense and is uncertain. The judge finds that the plaintiff's demurrer is unpersuasive and unavailing. The judge also notes that Uber's answer complies with the statute of limitations and that Uber has sufficiently pled an affirmative defense based on the statute of limitations, which defeats the plaintiff's demurrer. The judge overrules the demurrer and orders that the parties who intend to submit on the tentative ruling send an email to the court indicating their intention to do so.
