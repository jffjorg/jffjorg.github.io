And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled that the motion to continue the trial date to December 9, 2024, filed by Defendant Carrejo, is granted. The motion was unopposed and the Judge found that there was good cause for the continuance. Defendant Carrejo filed a motion for summary judgment that has a hearing date of October 2, 2024, and the Judge determined that it would be unfair to require the parties to prepare for trial before the motion for summary judgment has been heard. The Judge also noted that the action must be brought to trial within five years of its commencement, and that the continuance will allow the parties to avoid a potential delay in the trial.
