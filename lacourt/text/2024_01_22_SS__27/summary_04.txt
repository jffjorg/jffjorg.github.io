```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion filed by the Baldwin Defendants to file a cross-complaint against Antwan Gibbs. The motion is opposed due to procedural defects. Specifically, the Baldwin Defendants did not attach a copy of the proposed cross-complaint to the motion, and Gibbs was not served with the motion. The court cannot grant the motion without allowing Gibbs to be served and to respond. The court therefore continues the hearing to March 6, 2024, to allow the Baldwin Defendants to serve Gibbs with the motion and provide a copy of the proposed cross-complaint. The court orders the Baldwin Defendants to file a proof of service reflecting service of the motion on Gibbs by February 28, 2024, and to file a copy of the proposed cross-complaint with the court.
