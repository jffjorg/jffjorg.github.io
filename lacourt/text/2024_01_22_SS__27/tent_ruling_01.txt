I.           
INTRODUCTION
This
is an action where Plaintiff Farmers Insurance Exchange (“Plaintiff”) alleges
that Defendants Sonia Carrejo (“Carrejo”) and George Martinez (“Martinez”)
(collectively, “Defendants”) caused a fire at a property that Plaintiff
insured. On April 29, 2020, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendants and
Does 1 through 30 for equitable subrogation for damages for negligence to
property.  
On
May 5, 2020, Defendant Carrejo filed an answer to the complaint. 
On
May 6, 2020, Defendant Carrejo filed a cross-complaint against Martinez and
Roes 1 to 25, alleging causes of action for: (1) indemnification, (2)
apportionment of fault, and (3) declaratory relief. 
On
June 29, 2020, Plaintiff requested, and default was entered against Martinez.  
On
June 10, 2021, the Court entered an order and stipulation to continue trial,
which continued trial from October 7, 2021 to April 8, 2022. 
On
March 15, 2022, the Court granted the ex parte application to continue
trial filed by Defendant Carrejo, and the Court continued non-jury trial to
November 7, 2022. (03/15/22 Minute Order.)  
On
September 30, 2022, after hearing, the Court granted Plaintiff’s ex parte application
to continue trial. (09/30/22 Minute Order.) Pursuant to oral stipulation, the
Court continued non-jury trial from November 7, 2022 to March 4, 2024. (09/30/22
Minute Order.) The parties “agree[d] in open Court to the new trial date and
also agree[d] to the continuance of related deadlines.” (09/30/22 Minute
Order.) 
On
September 25, 2023, Plaintiff filed an Amendment to Complaint which corrected
the name of Martinez to his true name of Jorge Martinez. 
On
November 15, 2023, Defendant Carrejo filed a motion for summary judgment, which
is scheduled for hearing on October 2, 2024. 
On
September 21, 2023, Defendant Carrejo filed and served the instant motion to
continue the trial and all trial-related dates or, alternatively, specially
setting and advancing the hearing date on Defendant Carrejo’s motion for
summary judgment. Defendant Carrejo seeks a trial continuance to December 9,
2024, which is after the October 2, 2024 hearing on Defendant Carrejo’s motion
for summary judgment. 
On
January 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed and served a notice of non-opposition
indicating that it does not oppose Defendant Carrejo’s motion to continue
trial. 
          The motion is
therefore unopposed. Any opposition was required to have been filed and served
at least five court days prior to the hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd.
(b).) 
 
II.    LEGAL STANDARD
          A motion for
summary judgment must “be heard no later than 30 days before the date of trial,
unless the court for good cause considers otherwise.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c,
subd. (a)(3).) A motion for summary judgment “may be made at any time after 60
days have elapsed since the general appearance in the action or proceeding of
each party against whom the motion is directed.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c,
subd. (a)(1).) A court may not refuse to hear a summary judgment motion filed
within the time limits of Code Civ. Proc. § 437c. (Wells
Fargo Bank v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 918, 919.) 
Code Civ. Proc. § 128(a)(8) provides
that the court has the power to “amend and control its process and orders so as
to make them conform to law and justice.” “[T]he power to determine when a
continuance should be granted is within the discretion of the trial court.” (Color-Vue,
Inc. v. Abrams (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1599, 1603.) A trial court has wide
latitude in the matter of calendar control including the granting or denying of
continuances. (Park Motors, Inc. v. Cozens (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 12,
18.)  
A party seeking a continuance of the
date set for trial, whether contested or uncontested or stipulated by the
parties, must make the request for a continuance by a noticed motion or ex
parte application, with supporting declarations. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
3.1332(b).) The party must make the motion or application as soon as reasonably
practical once the necessity for the continuance is discovered. (Ibid.) 
Each request for a continuance must be
considered on its own merits according to California Rules of Court,
Rule 3.1332(c). The court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative
showing of good cause requiring the continuance.  (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332(c).) Good
cause may be present where a party has not been unable “to obtain essential
testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent efforts” or
there has been a “significant, unanticipated change in the status of the case
as a result of which the case is not ready for trial.” (Cal. Rules of Court,
Rule 3.1332(c)(6)-(7).) 
California Rules of Court, Rule
3.1332 sets forth a list of non-exhaustive factors to be analyzed when
determining whether good cause for a trial continuance is present. A court
considers factors such as: (1) the proximity of the trial date; (2) whether
there was any previous continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to
any party; (3) the length of the continuance requested; (4) the availability of
alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the motion or
application for a continuance; (5) the prejudice that parties or witnesses will
suffer as a result of the continuance; (6) if the case is entitled to a
preferential trial setting, the reasons for that status and whether the need
for a continuance outweighs the need to avoid delay; (7) the court’s calendar
and the impact of granting a continuance on other pending trials; (8) whether
trial counsel is engaged in another trial; (9) whether all parties have
stipulated to a continuance; (10) whether the interests of justice are best served
by a continuance, by the trial of the matter, or by imposing conditions on the
continuance; and (11) any other fact or circumstance relevant to the fair
determination of the motion or application. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
3.1332(d).) 
 
 
 
 
III.    DISCUSSION 
Issue No.1: Good Cause for Continuing Trial
          In support of
the Motion, Defendant Carrejo’s counsel, Armen A. Avakian (“Avakian”), declares
that Defendant Carrejo filed her motion for summary judgment, which has a
hearing date of October 2, 2024. (Avakian Decl., ¶ 5.) Counsel indicates that
Defendant Carrejo is seeking a continuance via noticed motion as early as
possible. (Avakian Decl., ¶ 6.) There have only been two prior continuances by
stipulation. (Avakian Decl., ¶ 7.) Defendant Carrejo is seeking an
approximately nine-month continuance of trial so that her motion for summary
judgment can be heard, and so that the parties can appropriately prepare for
and defend their positions at trial. (Avakian Decl., ¶ 8.) 
Counsel states that when the Court
renders its decision on the motion for summary judgment, the parties can
possibly enter settlement without the need for trial. (Avakian Decl., ¶ 9.)
Defendant Carrejo requests a trial continuance to December 9, 2024. (Avakian
Decl., ¶ 11.) Defendant Carrejo reserved the first available hearing date for
the motion for summary judgment and, due to the Court’s calendar, Defendant
Carrejo was unable to schedule the hearing at least 30 days prior to trial.
(Avakian Decl., ¶¶ 13-14.) Counsel states that the motion for summary judgment
raises what Defendant Carrejo contends are case-dispositive issues. (Avakian
Decl., ¶ 15.) Counsel states that absent the Court hearing Defendant Carrejo’s
motion for summary judgment, Defendant Carrejo will be unable to avail herself of
her statutory right, and both parties will be unable to properly prepare for
trial. (Avakian Decl., ¶ 16.) 
          Exercising
its discretion under Park Motors, Inc. v. Cozens, supra, 49
Cal.App.3d 12, 18, the Court finds it appropriate to continue the trial in this
matter. Defendant Carrejo reserved the earliest available hearing date for a
motion for summary judgment. Based on the current trial date, her motion for
summary judgment would not be heard until approximately seven months after
trial. Defendant Carrejo filed a timely motion for summary judgment and has a
right to have such motion heard prior to trial under Wells Fargo Bank v.
Superior Court, supra, 206 Cal.App.3d 918, 919. 
While not raised by the parties, the
Court notes that this action was commenced on April 9, 2020. The Court reminds
the parties that this action must be brought to trial within five years of its
commencement. (Code Civ. Proc., § 583.310.) 
          Accordingly, Defendant
Carrejo’s motion to continue trial is GRANTED. 
          
IV.     CONCLUSION
The Court GRANTS Defendant Carrejo’s
motion to continue trial. The Court continues non-jury trial in this action
from October 2, 2024, to Monday, December 9, 2024 at 8:30 AM in this department. All
trial-related dates, including discovery and motion cut-off dates, are based on
the continued trial date.
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.

 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SSCDEPT27@lacourt.org indicating

hearing and argue the matter.  Unless you
receive a submission from all other parties in the matter, you should assume
that others might appear at the hearing to argue.  If the Court does not receive emails from the
parties indicating submission on this tentative ruling and there are no
appearances at the hearing, the Court may, at its discretion, adopt the
tentative as the final order or place the motion off calendar.
      Dated this 22nd day of January 2024
