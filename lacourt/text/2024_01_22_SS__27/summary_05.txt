Counsel has also made efforts to locate Plaintiff, including serving moving papers on Plaintiff's last known address. The judge notes that counsel will be relieved as counsel of record for Plaintiff Joshua Jermaine Clark upon filing a proof of service of the signed Order Granting Attorney's Motion to be Relieved as Counsel.
