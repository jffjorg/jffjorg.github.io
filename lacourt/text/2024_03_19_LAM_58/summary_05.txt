And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a dispute over the applicability of Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.97 to certain invoices for arbitration fees. The parties had reached a settlement agreement in principle on October 11, 2022, but the plaintiff, Jose Sanchez, died before executing the agreement on December 13, 2022. The judge notes that while the parties had reached an agreement, it is unclear whether the invoices in question were for initial arbitration fees, which would be covered by the statute. The judge also references several case citations, including Espinoza v. Superior Court, Williams v. West Coast Hospitals, Inc., and De Leon v. Juanita's Foods, to illustrate the complexity of the issue.
