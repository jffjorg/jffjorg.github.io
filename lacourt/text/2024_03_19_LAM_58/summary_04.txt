Significant Statements:
  - "The Legislature enacted sections 1281.97 and 1281.98, recognizing that a 'company's failure to pay the fees of an arbitration provider' in a timely manner 'hinder[ed] the efficient resolution of disputes and contravene[d] public policy.'" (De Leon v. Juanita's Foods)
  - "Under the plain language of the statute, then, the triggering event is nothing more than nonpayment of fees within the 30-day periodâ€”the statute specifies no other required findings, such as whether the nonpayment was deliberate or inadvertent, or whether the delay prejudiced the nondrafting party." (Espinoza v. Superior Court)
  - "The court shall impose a monetary sanction against a drafting party that materially breaches an arbitration agreement... by ordering the drafting party to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees and costs, incurred by the employee or consumer as a result of the material breach." (Code of Civil Procedure Section 1281.99(a))
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion to vacate the arbitration order, as the plaintiff failed to demonstrate a material breach that would allow them to withdraw the claim from arbitration and proceed in court. The plaintiff did not withdraw the claim and instead chose to continue with the arbitration proceeding. The judge also ruled that the plaintiff is not entitled to sanctions, fees, and costs, as they have not demonstrated any reasonable expenses incurred as a result of the alleged material breach. The judge's decision is based on the plain language of the statutes, which requires that a drafting party pay arbitration fees within 30 days of the due date, and that a material breach occurs when a party fails to pay fees within that timeframe. The judge also considered the plaintiff's conduct throughout the arbitration proceeding, which showed that they continued to engage in the process despite the alleged material breach.
