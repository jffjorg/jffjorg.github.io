[1]           Although
not an excusable fact under such cases as Espinoza v. Superior Court
(2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 761 – the parties had, on October 11, 2022, reached a
settlement agreement in principle. (Nadir Decl., ¶ 4.) However, on December 13,
2022, Plaintiff Jose Sanchez died before executing the settlement agreement.
(I. Sanchez Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. A; Nadir Decl., ¶ 6.)


[2]           Although
Plaintiff cites Code of Civil Procedure
section 1281.97, which pertains to initial arbitration fees, it does not appear
that any of the invoices in question were for initial fees. 
 


[3]           Notably, Espinoza and Williams involved
Code of Civil Procedure Section 1281.97. (See Espinoza v. Superior Court
(2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 761, 773; Williams v. West Coast Hospitals, Inc.
(2022) 86 Cal.App.5th 1054, 1065.) With respect to De Leon, the Court of
Appeal noted that there was some ambiguity as to which statute applies to an “initial
retainer fee” but noted that in any case the statutes are materially identical
in relevant respects. (De Leon v. Juanita's Foods (2022) 85 Cal.App.5th
740, 749, fn. 7.)
