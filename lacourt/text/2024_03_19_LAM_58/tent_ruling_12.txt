Party:             Defendants Miniso Depot CA, Inc., USA Miniso Depot, Inc. and Lin Li

Responding
Party:      Plaintiff Yongtong “Jade” Liu

Tentative
Ruling:      The Motion to Compel
Arbitration is denied. 

 
In this
employment action, Plaintiff Yongtong “Jade” Liu (Plaintiff) filed a Complaint on October
5, 2023, alleging causes of action for FEHA violations and violations of the Labor
Code against her former employers, Defendants Miniso
Depot Ca, Inc. and USA Miniso Depot, Inc., and its CEO, Defendant Lin Li
(collectively, Defendants).
 
            On
January 31, 2024, Defendants filed a motion to compel arbitration pursuant to the
parties’ arbitration agreement. Plaintiff opposed the motion. A reply was
filed. 
 
            The motion to compel
arbitration is denied.
 
            Evidentiary Issues
 
            Plaintiff’s objections
to Defendants’ evidence are ruled as follows: Nos. 1-2 are overruled. (See Wang
Reply Decl., ¶¶ 1-5.)  
 
Legal
Standard 
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure
section 1281.2, a court may order arbitration of a controversy if it finds that
the parties have agreed to arbitrate that dispute. Because the obligation to
arbitrate arises from contract, the court may compel arbitration only if the
dispute in question is one in which the parties have agreed to arbitrate. (Weeks
v. Crow (1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 350, 352.) Since arbitration is a favored
method of dispute resolution, arbitration agreements should be liberally
interpreted, and arbitration should be ordered unless the agreement clearly
does not apply to the dispute in question. (Id. at p. 353; Segal v.
Silberstein (2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 627, 633.)
 
Analysis
 
            Defendants
move to compel arbitration of Plaintiff’s claims and stay the action while the
arbitration is pending.
 
I.              
Existence of a Valid Arbitration Agreement
 
            Defendants
seek to compel arbitration based on an arbitration agreement attached to Plaintiff’s Offer Letter. In support
of the existence of an arbitration agreement, Defendants submit evidence that Plaintiff
began
working for Defendants as an HR Administrator on May 14, 2021. (Wang Decl., ¶ 2,
Ex. 1.) In connection to her employment, Plaintiff executed an agreement titled “Restatement
of Offer of Employment” and Exhibit B “VOLUNTARY MUTUAL ARBITRATION AGREEMENT
AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER”
(Arbitration Agreement), obligating her to arbitrate any employment-related
disputes with Defendants. (Wang Decl., ¶¶ 2, Ex. 1, ¶¶ 1-2.)
 
The Agreement provides that
Plaintiff and Defendants mutually agreed that “any and all disputes, claims, or
causes of action, in law or equity, arising from or relating to your
employment, or the termination of your employment, will be resolved, to the
fullest extent permitted by law by final, binding, and confidential arbitration
in your county and state of employment conducted by the Judicial Arbitration
and Mediation Services/Endispute, Inc. (“JAMS”), or its successors, under the
then current rules of JAMS for employment disputes.” (Wang Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. 1, ¶
1.) 
 
            In
opposition, Plaintiff argues that Defendants have not submitted admissible
evidence of the existence of the arbitration agreement. As noted above, the
Court has overruled Plaintiff’s objections to Defendants’ evidence based, in
part, on the reply evidence submitted. 
 
            Further,
Plaintiff submits no declaration of her own otherwise challenging Defendants’
evidence and contesting the authenticity of the Agreement or her signature.
Thus, Defendants have met their burden of demonstrating the existence of a
valid arbitration agreement. 


II.            
Enforceability of the Arbitration Agreement 
 
In opposition, Plaintiff argues that
this case cannot be compelled to arbitration based on the Ending the Forced
Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021 (the Act and
EFAA). 
 
The EFAA amends the FAA.[1]
The Act
provides, “[A]t the election of the person alleging conduct constituting a
sexual harassment dispute ... no predispute arbitration agreement ... shall be
valid or enforceable with respect to a case which is filed under ... State law
and relates to ... the sexual harassment dispute.” (9 U.S.C. § 402(a).) “The
term ‘sexual harassment dispute’ means a dispute relating to conduct that is
alleged to constitute sexual harassment under applicable Federal, Tribal, or
State law.” (9 U.S.C. § 401(4).) “An issue as to whether this chapter applies
with respect to a dispute shall be determined under Federal law.” (9 U.S.C. §
402(b).)
 
In response,
Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s allegations of sexual harassment are insufficient
to fall within the scope of the Act. That is, Defendants specifically challenge
the sufficiency of Plaintiff’s allegations to the sexual harassment cause of
action, citing Yost v. Everyrealm, Inc. (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 24, 2023) 2023 WL
2224450. In Yost, the Southern District of New York held “the term
‘alleged’ as used in § 401(4) is best read to implicitly incorporate the
plausibility standard.” (Yost v. Everyrealm, Inc., supra, 2023 WL
2224450, at *14–18.)
 
As Plaintiff
notes, there is no controlling authority that employs this sufficiency of the pleadings
standard. Further, and more importantly, the Complaint adequately states a
claim for sexual harassment. (Compl., ¶¶ 19-20.)
 
Defendants
also suggest that the actionable, relevant sexual harassment occurred before
the enactment of the EFAA. 
 
“The EFAA
was enacted on March 3, 2022, and does not have retroactive effect.” (Turner
v. Tesla, Inc. (N.D. Cal., Aug. 11, 2023, No. 23-CV-02451-WHO) 2023 WL
6150805, at *4.)
 
Here, Defendant
contends that Plaintiff’s
allegations indicate she was harassed “at all relevant times during her
employment.” (Compl. ¶ 19.) She further contends that she was hired “[i]n or
around April 2021.” Accordingly, Defendants claim that Plaintiff contends that
her harassment began in 2021 and the claim therefore accrued prior to the
enactment of the EFAA. 
 
However, the allegations do not show
that the harassment stopped before Plaintiff was constructively terminated in
June 2023. (Compl., ¶¶ 9-11.) As such, based on the allegations, the harassment
claim continued to accrue into the period after the EFAA was enacted such that
the statute applies to Plaintiff’s sexual harassment claim. 
 
Based on the
foregoing, the EFAA applies to Plaintiff’s sexual harassment claim. 
 
Further, the
EFAA precludes arbitration of all the other claims of the Complaint as well.
 
In Johnson
v. Everyrealm, Inc., Case No. 22-cv-6669, 2023 WL 2216173, at *18 (S.D.N.Y.
Feb. 24, 2023), in which he held that “the text of § 402(a) makes clear that
its invalidation of an arbitration agreement extends to the entirety of the
case relating to the sexual harassment dispute, not merely the discrete claims
in that case that themselves either allege such harassment or relate to a
sexual harassment dispute (for example, a claim of unlawful retaliation for a
report of sexual harassment).” In that case, plaintiff brought racial and pay
discrimination claims in addition to sexual harassment claims and, under the
court’s holding, those racial and pay discrimination claims were protected by
the EFAA because they were part of a case that plausibly alleged sexual
harassment claims. 
 
Similarly,
in Turner v. Tesla, Inc. (N.D. Cal., Aug. 11, 2023, No. 23-CV-02451-WHO)
2023 WL 6150805, the court found that the
plaintiff’s “workplace injury and wage claims relate only to her own experience
and employment at Tesla—and are intertwined with her sexual harassment claims.”
(Turner v. Tesla, Inc. (N.D. Cal., Aug. 11, 2023, No. 23-CV-02451-WHO)
2023 WL 6150805, at *5.)  (But see, Mera
v. SA Hospitality Group, LLC (S.D.N.Y., June 3, 2023, No. 123CV03492PGGSDA)
2023 WL 3791712, holding that, in contrast to Johnson, supra, “[s]ince Plaintiff's wage and hour
claims under the FLSA and the NYLL do not relate in any way to the sexual
harassment dispute, they must be arbitrated, as the Arbitration Agreement
requires.” (Id. at *4.) The Court finds the California district court
decision in Turner more persuasive and a more efficient use of judicial
resources.
 
            Thus,
all of Plaintiff’s claims are subject to the EFFA and non-arbitrable. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Accordingly,
Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration is denied.
