 
Background
 
            Plaintiff Bishoy Hanna brings this
action against Defendants Crystal Boultinghouse (Boultinghouse) and Judge Josh Freeman
Stinn (Stinn), alleging cause of action for (1.)
conspiracy to violate 42 USC section 1983 and (2.) due process violation. 
 
Defendant Boultinghouse now brings a
special motion to strike the Complaint pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 425.16, arguing that the claims arise from petitioning conduct that is
protected under section 425.16, subdivision (e). She further argues that
Plaintiff cannot show any likelihood of success because the Complaint fails to
state a claim and the claims are barred by the litigation privilege.
 
No opposition was filed. However, on
March 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint. The amended pleading
does not moot out the anti-SLAPP motion where the anti-SLAPP motion was pending
at the time the FAC was filed. (JKC3H8 v. Colton (2013) 221
Cal.App.4th 468, 477 [explaining that “[a] plaintiff or cross-complainant may
not seek to subvert or avoid a ruling on an anti-SLAPP motion by amending the
challenged complaint or cross-complaint in response to the motion.”].)
 
            The special
motion to strike is granted.
 
Legal Standard
 
“A cause of action against a person
arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person’s right of
petition or free speech under the United States Constitution or the California Constitution
in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to
strike, unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that
there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd. (b)(1).) The purpose of the statute is to identify
and dispose of lawsuits brought to chill the valid exercise of a litigant’s
constitutional right of petition or free speech. (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16,
subd. (a); Sylmar Air Conditioning v.
Pueblo Contracting Services, Inc. (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 1049, 1055-1056.)
 
Courts employ a two-step process to
evaluate special motions to strike strategic lawsuits against public
participation (SLAPP). (Equilon
Enterprises v. Consumer Cause, Inc. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 53, 61.)  First, the defendant must show that the
challenged lawsuit arises from protected activity, such as an act in
furtherance of the right of petition or free speech. (Ibid.) “The moving defendant bears the burden of identifying all
allegations of protected activity, and the claims supported by them.” (Baral
v. Schmitt (2016) 1 Cal.5th 376, 396.) In the second step, it “
‘is then up to the plaintiff to rebut the presumption by showing a reasonable probability
of success on the merits.’ ” (Equilon,
supra, 29 Cal.4th at p.
61.) In determining whether the plaintiff has carried this burden, the
trial court considers “the pleadings, and supporting and opposing affidavits
stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 425.16, subd. (b)(2); see Soukup
v. Law Offices of Herbert Hafif (2006) 39 Cal.4th 260, 291.)
 
“Analysis of an anti-SLAPP motion is
not confined to evaluating whether an entire cause of action, as pleaded by the
plaintiff, arises from protected activity or has merit. Instead, courts should
analyze each claim for relief—each act or set of acts supplying a basis for
relief, of which there may be several in a single pleaded cause of action—to
determine whether the acts are protected and, if so, whether the claim they
give rise to has the requisite degree of merit to survive the motion.” (Bonni
v. St. Joseph Health System (2021) 11 Cal.5th 995, 1010.) 
 
Discussion
 
I.              
Arising
from Protected Activity
 
As outlined above, in the first step
of the analysis, Defendant must demonstrate that Plaintiff’s claims arise from one
of four categories of protected activity. An “ ‘act in furtherance of a
person’s right of petition or free speech under the United States or California
Constitution in connection with a public issue’ includes: (1) any written or
oral statement or writing made before a legislative, executive, or judicial
proceeding, or any other official proceeding authorized by law, (2) any written
or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under
consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any
other official proceeding authorized by law, (3) any written or oral statement
or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection
with an issue of public interest, or (4) any other conduct in furtherance of
the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional
right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public
interest.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16,
subd. (e).)
 
“As our Supreme Court has
recognized, ‘the “arising from” requirement is not always easily met.’
[Citation.] ‘[T]he mere fact that an action was filed after protected activity
took place does not mean the action arose from that activity for the purposes of
the anti-SLAPP statute. [Citation.] Moreover, that a cause of action arguably
may have been “triggered” by protected activity does not entail that it is one
arising from such.’ [Citation.] ‘A claim arises from protected activity when
that activity underlies or forms the basis for the claim. [Citations.]  Critically, “the defendant’s act underlying
the plaintiff’s cause of action must itself have been an act in furtherance of
the right of petition or free speech.” [Citations.]’ [Citation.] ‘[I]n ruling
on an anti-SLAPP motion, courts should consider the elements of the challenged
claim and what actions by the defendant supply those elements and consequently
form the basis for liability.’ [Citation.] Put another way, courts should first
identify ‘the allegedly wrongful and injury-producing conduct that provides the
foundation for the claims,’ and then determine whether that conduct itself
constitutes protected activity. [Citations.]” (Callanan v. Grizzly Designs,
LLC (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 517, 526 (Callanan) [citing Park, supra,
2 Cal.5th at pp. 1062-1063].) 
 
            Defendant
first argues that Plaintiff’s claims arise from protected activity under Code of
Civil Procedure section 425.16 because the allegations are based on conduct undertaken
by Defendant as part of her representation of her client in a judicial
proceeding against Plaintiff.  
 
            As pertinent
here, an analysis of whether a cause of action arises from statements or
writings “made in connection with an issue under
consideration or review by a ... judicial body” under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16,
subd. (e)(2) may “be broken down into three components: (a) was there an ‘issue
under consideration or review by a ... judicial body’; (b) were [Defendant’s]
statements [or writings] made ‘in connection with’ this issue; and (c) did the
cause of action pleaded by [Plaintiff] ‘aris[e] from’ [Defendant’s] statements
[or writings]?” (City of Costa Mesa v. D'Alessio Investments, LLC (2013)
214 Cal.App.4th 358, 372-373.) A statement or writing is “in connection with” litigation if
it “relates to the substantive issues in the litigation and is directed to
persons having some interest in the litigation.” (Seltzer v.
Barnes (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 953, 962; Neville v. Chudacoff (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th
1255.)  
 
            Here, the
Complaint’s conspiracy to violate 42 USC section 1983 is based on allegations
that Defendant Boultinghouse, an attorney, met with Defendant Stinn, a judicial
officer, on multiple occasions outside the superior court to conspire to deny pleadings
made by Plaintiff in his child custody hearing. (Compl., ¶¶ 6-7.) Plaintiff
also challenges Defendant Stinn’s order to Plaintiff to empty his entire bank
account and give all funds to Defendant Boultinghouse. Similarly, the due
process violation claim is based on Defendant Stinn’s granting ex parte
applications made by Defendant Boultinghouse. (Compl., ¶ 17.)
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s claims
arise from Defendant Boultinghouse’s statements and writings made in connection
to an issue under
consideration by a judicial body. Defendant has met her burden of showing that Plaintiff’s
claims arise from protected activity. 
 
II.           
Demonstrating Minimal Merit 
 
On the second component of the analysis, courts employ a
“summary-judgment-like” procedure, “accepting as true the evidence favorable to
the plaintiff and evaluating the defendant’s evidence only to determine whether
the defendant has defeated the plaintiff’s evidence as a matter of law.” (Gerbosi v. Gaims, Weil, West & Epstein,
LLP (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 435, 444.) The Court does not assess
credibility, and the plaintiff is not required to meet the preponderance of the
evidence standard. The Court accepts as true the evidence favorable to the
plaintiff, who need only establish that his or her claim has “minimal merit” to
avoid being stricken as a SLAPP. (Soukup,
supra, 39 Cal.4th at p. 291.) Plaintiff must demonstrate that the complaint is
both “ ‘legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of
facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the
plaintiff is credited.’ ” (Ibid.)
 
“The litigation privilege is . . . relevant to the second
step in the anti-SLAPP analysis in that it may present a substantive defense a
plaintiff must overcome to demonstrate a probability of prevailing.”  (Flatley
v. Mauro, supra, 39 Cal.4th at p. 323.)  The “absolute” privilege generally applies
“to any communication (1) made in judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings; (2)
by litigants or other participants authorized by law; (3) to achieve the
objects of the litigation; and (4) that have some connection or logical
relation to the action.” (Silberg v. Anderson (1990) 50 Cal.3d 205,
212, 215.) The “principal purpose of [the litigation privilege] is to afford
litigants . . . the utmost freedom of access to the courts without fear of
being harassed subsequently by derivative tort actions.” (Id. at p. 213.)  
 
All of Plaintiff’s causes of action incorporate his factual
allegations from earlier and are therefore based on the same categories of
conduct. 
 
As a preliminary matter, none of the allegations in
Plaintiff’s Complaint support a legally sufficient claim. (Gilbert v. Sykes
(2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 13, 31 [“If the pleadings are not adequate to support a
cause of action, the plaintiff has failed to carry his burden in resisting the
[anti-SLAPP] motion”].)
 
To state a claim under Section 1983, “ ‘a plaintiff must
allege the violation of a right secured by the Constitution and laws of the
United States, and must show that the alleged deprivation was committed by a
person acting under color of state law.’ ” (Arce v. Childrens Hospital Los
Angeles (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 1455, 1472.) Because Section 1983 liability
requires “a violation of the underlying constitutional right” (Daniels v.
Williams (1986) 474 U.S. 327, 330), a threshold inquiry is whether the
plaintiff has presented an adequate factual basis to
establish a deprivation of the constitutional right. (Arce, supra,
at pp. 1472–1473; Berman v. City of Daly City (1993) 21 Cal.App.4th 276,
286.) “Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by
mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.” (Ashcroft v. Iqbal (2009)
556 U.S. 662, 678.) Rather, “ ‘[s]ome particularized facts demonstrating a
constitutional deprivation’ ” are required. (Bach v. County of Butte (1983) 147
Cal.App.3d 554, 563–564.)
 
“In order to allege a conspiracy
under § 1983, a plaintiff must show ‘an agreement or “meeting of the minds” to
violate constitutional rights.’ [Citation.] ‘To be liable, each participant in
the conspiracy need not know the exact details of the plan, but each
participant must at least share the common objective of the conspiracy.’ ” (Steel
v. City of San Diego (S.D.Cal.2010) 726 F.Supp.2d 1172, 1179 [finding
conspiracy sufficiently pleaded where plaintiff alleged telephone conversations
and other communications between defendants and identified testimony by
defendants regarding the communications].) “[A]llegations of conspiracy must be
supported by material facts, not merely conclusory statements.” (Woodrum v.
Woodward County, Okl. (9th Cir.1989) 866 F.2d 1121, 1126.) Further, “A
plaintiff must allege with particularity facts in the form of specific overt
acts.” (Taylor v. Mitzel (1978) 82 Cal.App.3d 665, 673.)


The violation of Section 1983 and the related conspiracy
claim both require specific allegations of the factual basis to establish a
deprivation of the constitutional right and the exact details of the
conspiracy. The Complaint fails to plead such specific details. 
 
            Moreover, in
addition to the Complaint’s incoherence, Plaintiff’s failure to file an
opposition means that Plaintiff has not carried his burden on this second
prong. (Wilson v. Parker, Covert & Chidester (2002) 28 Cal.4th 811,
821 [To defeat the anti-SLAPP motion once the burden has shifted to the
plaintiff, “the plaintiff ‘must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally
sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to
sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is
credited.’ [Citations.]”].) Plaintiff has submitted no evidence to make a prima
facie showing of his claims against Defendant. 
 
Further, in the absence of an
opposition, Plaintiff fails to address Defendant’s arguments that the
litigation privilege applies to Defendants’ conduct to defeat Plaintiff’s
claims. 
 
“Civil Code section 47, subdivision
(b) defines what is commonly known as the ‘litigation privilege.’ ” (Kashian
v. Harriman (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 892, 912.) The privilege typically
“applies to any communication (1) made in judicial or quasi-judicial
proceedings; (2) by litigants or other participants authorized by law; (3) to
achieve the objects of the litigation; and (4) that have some connection or
logical relation to the action.” (Silberg v. Anderson (1990) 50 Cal.3d
205, 212.) “Thus, ‘communications with “some relation” to judicial proceedings’
are ‘absolutely immune from tort liability’ by the litigation privilege
[citation].” (Rusheen v. Cohen (2006) 37 Cal.4th 1048, 1057.) “Many
cases have explained that [Civil Code] section 47(b) encompasses not only
testimony in court and statements made in pleadings, but also statements made
prior to the filing of a lawsuit, whether in preparation for anticipated
litigation or to investigate the feasibility of filing a lawsuit.” (Hagberg
v. California Federal Bank (2004) 32 Cal.4th 350, 361; see Briggs v.
Eden Council for Hope & Opportunity (1999) 19 Cal.4th 1106, 1115 [“
‘communications preparatory to or in anticipation of the bringing of an action
... are within the litigation privilege’ ”].) 
 
The privilege presents “a
substantive defense a plaintiff . . . must overcome to demonstrate a
probability of prevailing.” (Flatley v. Mauro (2006) 39 Cal.4th 299, 323.)
 
To the extent that Plaintiff relies
on Defendants’ statements regarding Plaintiff’s pleadings, oral arguments, or
other litigation acts, these actions fall under the privilege. All of the
alleged conduct occurred in relation to the filing and granting of a domestic
violence restraining order and other requests in the family court. (Seltzer,
supra, 182 Cal.App.4th at pp. 970-971.)
 
Thus, Plaintiff’s has failed to make
a bare minimum prima facie showing for claims and not met his burden on the
second prong. 
 
Conclusion
 
The special motion to
strike Plaintiff’s complaint against Defendant Boultinghouse pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 425.16 is granted.
