And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a cross-complaint filed by SBDTLA against Manhattan Loft on May 21, 2022, seeking contractual and equitable indemnity, declaratory relief, and equitable contribution. The judge is unclear if the mandatory relief provision is still available, as a voluntary dismissal was made and it is unclear if this constitutes the "entry of judgment" that starts the clock. The judge notes that if there was no entry of judgment, there would be no time limit for the mandatory relief provision. The ruling references California Code of Civil Procedure, ยง 473, subdivision (b), as well as a 2004 court case, Nacimiento Regional Water Management Advisory Com. v. Monterey County Water Resources Agency.
