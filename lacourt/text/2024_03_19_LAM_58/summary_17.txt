As for the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling grants Defendant Boultinghouse's special motion to strike Plaintiff's complaint as a Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation (SLAPP) under California Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16. The Court finds that Plaintiff's claims arise from protected activity, specifically Defendant Boultinghouse's statements and writings made in connection with an issue under consideration by a judicial body. The Court also finds that Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate minimal merit for his claims and has not carried his burden on the second prong of the anti-SLAPP analysis. The litigation privilege applies to Defendant Boultinghouse's conduct, and Plaintiff has failed to plead specific facts to establish a deprivation of constitutional rights.
