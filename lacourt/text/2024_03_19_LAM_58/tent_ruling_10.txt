cross-complaint against Manhattan Loft for Contractual and Equitable Indemnity,
Declaratory Relief, and Equitable Contribution.

less clear if mandatory relief is also untimely. Mandatory relief is available “whenever an application for relief is made
no more than six months after entry of judgment, is in proper form, and is
accompanied by an attorney's sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.” (Civ. Code Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) Here,
where there was a voluntary dismissal, it is unclear if this dismissal
constitutes the “entry of judgment” which starts the running of the clock.
However, as a practical matter, there would be no time limit for the mandatory
relief provision for a voluntary dismissal where there would otherwise be no
entry of judgment; thus, it would seem that the dismissal is the appropriate action
by which to start this clock. (Cf. Nacimiento Regional Water Management
Advisory Com. v. Monterey County Water Resources Agency (2004) 122
Cal.App.4th 961, 968.)
