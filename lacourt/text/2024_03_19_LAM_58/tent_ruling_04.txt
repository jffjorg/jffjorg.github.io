 
            Plaintiff
Jose Sanchez sued Defendant Foundation Buildings Materials, LLC. The Complaint
contains causes of action for (1) Disability discrimination in violation of the
Federal Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), (2) Failure to accommodate in
violation of the FEHA, (3) Failure to engage in the interactive process in
violation of the FEHA, and (4) Wrongful termination in violation of public
policy.
 
             On October 29, 2020, Defendant Foundation
Buildings Materials, LLC moved to compel arbitration. The Court granted the
motion on December 4, 2020. 
 
            On
June 13, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel moved for an order pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure Section 377.31, substituting decedent’s daughter, Irene Sanchez, in
her capacity as successor in interest of her late father (decedent Jose
Sanchez) under Code of Civil Procedure Section 377.11 as plaintiff in place of
decedent. The Court granted the motion in part, and allowed amendment to the
Complaint to substitute Irene Sanchez in as Plaintiff’s successor in interest. 
 
            Now,
Plaintiff moves for an order to vacate the arbitration order and allow this
matter to proceed within the Los Angeles Superior Court based on Defendant’s
failure to pay all arbitration fees owed within thirty (30) days of their
invoiced due date. Further, Plaintiff seeks sanctions and statutorily mandated
recovery of attorneys’ fees and costs accrued to date against Defendant in the
total amount of $115,921.60, pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure
Sections 1281.98(c) and 1281.99(a).
 
            The
motion to vacate the arbitration order is denied. The Request for sanctions,
costs, and attorney fees is denied.
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Plaintiff argues that she is entitled to relief pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure sections 1281.97 and 1281.98.
 
            The Legislature enacted sections
1281.97 and 1281.98, recognizing that a “ ‘company's failure to pay the fees of
an arbitration provider’ ” in a timely manner “ ‘hinder[ed] the efficient
resolution of disputes and contravene[d] public policy.’ ” (De Leon v.
Juanita's Foods (2022) 85 Cal.App.5th 740, 750.) 
 
Sections
1281.97 and 1281.98 “largely parallel” each other. (Gallo v. Wood Ranch USA,
Inc. (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 621, 633, fn. 4.) Whereas section 1281.97
concerns a failure to timely pay “the fees or costs to initiate” an arbitration
proceeding (§ 1281.97, subd. (a)(1), italics added), section 1281.98 concerns a
failure to timely pay “the fees or costs required to continue” an arbitration
proceeding (§ 1281.98, subd. (a)(1), italics added).
 
Both
statutes require that the arbitration provider transmit an invoice to the
parties specifying “the full amount owed and the date that payment is due,”
generally indicating the invoice is “due on receipt.” (§ 1281.97, subd. (a)(2);
§ 1281.98, subd. (a)(2).) It also allows a grace period for payment of “30 days
after the due date.” (§ 1281.98, subd. (a)(1); § 1281.97, subd. (a)(2).)
 
            Here, Plaintiff contend that
Defendant failed to timely pay arbitration fee invoices on three (3) occasions.

 
First, on
September 19, 2022, JAMS issued an invoice to Defendant for a $61,600 retainer
deposit, stating, “Payment is due upon receipt.” (Nadir Decl. ¶ 10, Ex. B.)
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.98(a)(1), Defendant had until
October 19, 2022 (30 days from September 19, 2022) to issue payment. Defendant
did not timely pay. (Nadir Decl., ¶ 10(a), Ex. C.)[1] 
 
Second, on
December 15, 2023, JAMS issued another invoice to Defendant for a $5,600
retainer deposit, stating again, “Payment is due upon receipt.” (Nadir Decl. ¶
10(c), Ex. D.) Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.98(a)(1), Defendant
had until January 14, 2024 (30 days from December 15, 2023) to issue payment. Defendant
did not timely pay. (Nadir Decl. ¶ 10(c), Ex. D.)  
 
Finally, JAMS
issued another separate invoice on January 3, 2024 for Defendant’s $33,600
retainer deposit, again stating that payment was due immediately. (Nadir Decl.
¶ 10(d), Ex. E.) Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.98(a)(1), Defendant
had until February 2, 2024 (30 days from January 3, 2024) to issue payment. Following
some clarification regarding existing credits, Defendant did not pay the December
15, 2023 and January 3, 2024 invoices until February 5, 2024. (Wulffson Decl.,
¶¶ 15-18; Nadir Decl. ¶ 10(e)-(g).)
             
            Notwithstanding the foregoing
undisputed facts, Plaintiff’s motion seeking to vacate the arbitration order is
not well taken and ignores the relevant statutory law. 
 
Subdivision (b) of Code of Civil Procedure
section 1281.98 provides:[2]
 
“If the drafting party materially breaches
the arbitration agreement and is in default under subdivision (a), the employee
or consumer may unilaterally elect to do any of the following:
 
(1)  Withdraw
the claim from arbitration and proceed in a court of appropriate jurisdiction.
If the employee or consumer withdraws the claim from arbitration and proceeds
with an action in a court of appropriate jurisdiction, the statute of
limitations with regard to all claims brought or that relate back to any claim
brought in arbitration shall be tolled as of the date of the first filing of a
claim in any court, arbitration forum, or other dispute resolution forum.
(2)  Continue
the arbitration proceeding, if the arbitration provider agrees to continue
administering the proceeding, notwithstanding the drafting party's failure to
pay fees or costs. The neutral arbitrator or arbitration provider may institute
a collection action at the conclusion of the arbitration proceeding against the
drafting party that is in default of the arbitration for payment of all fees
associated with the employment or consumer arbitration proceeding, including
the cost of administering any proceedings after the default.
(3)  Petition
the court for an order compelling the drafting party to pay all arbitration
fees that the drafting party is obligated to pay under the arbitration
agreement or the rules of the arbitration provider.
(4)  Pay the drafting party's fees and proceed with the
arbitration proceeding. As part of the award, the employee or consumer shall
recover all arbitration fees paid on behalf of the drafting party without
regard to any findings on the merits in the underlying arbitration. ” [italics
added.]
 
In support of her motion, Plaintiff relies
heavily on Espinoza v. Superior Court (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 761, Williams
v. West Coast Hospitals (2022) 86 Cal.App.5th 1054 and De Leon v.
Juanita's Foods, Inc. (2022) 85 Cal.App.5th 740.[3]
 
These cases are on point only to the extent
that they strictly construe a material breach in failing to pay arbitration
fees. 
 
In De Leon, in discussing Section 1281.98,
the court explained that it found “nothing in this language that is ambiguous
regarding the requisite circumstances to determine the existence of a
statutorily defined material breach of an arbitration agreement. To the
contrary, the statute's language establishes a simple bright-line rule that a
drafting party's failure to pay outstanding arbitration fees within 30 days
after the due date results in its material breach of the arbitration
agreement.” (De Leon v. Juanita's Foods, supra, 85 Cal.App.5th at 753.)
 
Similarly, in Espinoza, the Court of
Appeal reversed the trial court’s conclusion that a defendant's late payment of
an arbitration provider's invoice was “in ‘substantial[ ] compliance’ with the
arbitration agreement and ‘not in material breach,’ because the delayed payment
was due to ‘ “clerical error,” ’ and the delay did not prejudice plaintiff.” (Id.
at p. 775.) The Court of Appeal concluded that the “language of section 1281.97
is unambiguous.” (Id. at p. 776.) “Under the plain language of the
statute, then, the triggering event is nothing more than nonpayment of fees
within the 30-day period—the statute specifies no other required findings, such
as whether the nonpayment was deliberate or inadvertent, or whether the delay
prejudiced the nondrafting party.” (Ibid.) The court concluded that the
“plain language therefore indicates the Legislature intended the statute to be
strictly applied whenever a drafting party failed to pay by the statutory
deadline.” (Ibid.)
 
Thus, Plaintiff is correct that Defendant’s
failure to pay the arbitration fees invoices in a timely manner resulted in a
material default under Section 1281.98, subdivision (a). 
 
            However, Plaintiff’s actions and past
course of conduct throughout the arbitration process shows that Plaintiff opted
to proceed with the arbitration despite these three purported material breaches.
That is, Plaintiff elected to “continue the arbitration
proceeding” under Section 1981.98, subdivision (b)(2), rather than withdraw
the claim from arbitration under subdivision (b)(1). 
 
            Thus, for any material default stemming
from the September 19, 2022 breach, Plaintiff elected to continue with the
arbitration proceeding. Plaintiff filed this motion on February 21, 2024 – a year and half later and after substantive
litigation occurred between the parties in the arbitration proceeding. (Wulffson
Decl., ¶¶ 7-8.) 
 
With
respect to the December 2023 and January 2024 breaches, the evidence shows that
Plaintiff again elected to “continue the arbitration proceeding.” 
 
As
relevant background context to the filing of the motion to vacate the
arbitration order, Plaintiff’s motion to vacate the arbitration order was filed
after the Arbitrator ruled on two of Defendant’s summary judgment motions.
First, in September 2023, Defendant filed a dispositive motion based on the
lack of economic damages and the inability for Plaintiff Irene Sanchez, as
successor in interest, to obtain emotional distress damages by a deceased
claimant. (Wulffson Decl., ¶ 7.) On November 17, 2023, the Arbitrator granted Defendant’s
second dispositive motion and ruled that Plaintiff Jose Sanchez did not suffer
economic damages because he was totally disabled at the time of his termination
and Irene Sanchez was precluded from recovering emotional distress damages as
successor in interest. (Wulffson Decl., ¶ 7, Ex. F.)
 
Then, in
December 2023, Defendant filed another dispositive motion seeking to dismiss
the Complaint in its entirety based on Irene Sanchez’s inability to obtain
punitive damages and attorneys’ fees in light of the Arbitrator’s prior
dispositive ruling that precluded economic damages and emotional distress
damages. (Wulffson Decl., ¶ 8.) 
 
             Defendant filed its motion and supporting
documentation on December 13, 2023; Plaintiff Irene Sanchez filed her
opposition on January 17, 2024 – after the deadline for the December 15, 2023
arbitration fees invoice had passed. Defendant filed its reply on January 24,
2024. (Nadir Decl., ¶ 8.) Oral argument was conducted via Zoom on January 31,
2024. (Nadir Decl., ¶ 8.) On or about January 31, 2024, the Arbitrator granted Defendants’
dispositive motion, in part, and ruled that Plaintiff is precluded from seeking
punitive damages and associated attorneys’ fees but may seek nominal damages
and associated attorneys’ costs. (Wulffson Decl., ¶ 8, Ex. G.)
 
            Finally, the evidence shows that –
after the February 2 deadline passed for the January 3, 2024 invoices – Plaintiff
continued to actively seek discovery from Defendant in the arbitration
proceeding following this purported default. (Wulffson Decl., ¶¶ 9, 22, Ex. H;
Nadir Decl., ¶ 9.) Plaintiff even participated in a discovery conference with
the Arbitrator on February 16, 2024, regarding Plaintiff’s recent attempts to
take the deposition of Defendant’s PMK. (Wulffson Decl., ¶¶ 9, 22, Ex. H.) Plaintiff’s
motion to vacate the arbitration order was not filed until February 21, 2024.
 
            Plaintiff’s actions evince conduct consistent
with acts of a party intending to proceed with arbitration under Section 1281.98,
subdivision (b)(2) – not withdraw from arbitration under subdivision (b)(1). Specifically,
Plaintiff’s conduct shows repeated and regular engagement in the arbitration
proceeding after Defendant’s invoice breaches of September 2022 and December
2023. Further, with respect to the January invoice breach, Plaintiff’s subsequent
conduct was consistent with past conduct where Plaintiff continued to engage in
the arbitration proceeding. In this instance specifically, Plaintiff actively
engaged in deposition date discussions with Defendant and participated in a
discovery conference with the Arbitrator regarding this discovery. (Wulffson
Decl., ¶¶ 9, 22, Ex. H.) In fact, the evidence suggests that only after the
discovery conference occurred – where the Arbitrator appears to have agreed to
Defendant’s suggestion that Plaintiff either settle this action or stipulate to
a nominal damages – did Plaintiff give any indication that Plaintiff no longer
intended to proceed with the arbitration – by filing this instant motion to
vacate the arbitration order. 
 
            Moreover, on March 11, 2024, the
Arbitrator issued an Order indicating: (1) Defendant has stipulated to
liability in this matter, and that Claimant JOSE SANCHEZ is entitled to nominal
damages in the amount of $1.00, pursuant to the Arbitrator’s prior rulings in
this matter; (2) That the hearing dates of May 1 and 2, 2024 be vacated; and (3)
That Claimant may file a motion for an award of attorneys’ fees and/or costs by
no later than March 23, 2024, which shall include an explanation as to why such
an award is warranted in light of the California Supreme Court’s decision in Chavez
v. City of Los Angeles, 47 Cal.4th 970 (2010). (3/14/24 Amos Decl., ¶ 3,
Ex. A.) Thus, except for Plaintiff’s request for attorney fees in the
underlying arbitration proceeding, the underlying arbitration proceeding
appears to be complete. 
 
            As result of the Court’s finding
that Plaintiff did not “withdraw[] the claim from arbitration and proceed[] in
a court of appropriate jurisdiction” under Section 1281.98, subdivision (b)(1)
– subdivision (c), which allows attorney fees, costs, and sanctions, does not
apply. 
 
Lastly, as
noted above, Plaintiff has demonstrated a material breach. Under Code of Civil
Procedure section 1281.99, “[t]he court shall impose a monetary sanction
against a drafting party that materially breaches an arbitration agreement
pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 1281.97 or subdivision (a) of Section
1281.98, by ordering the drafting party to pay the reasonable expenses,
including attorney's fees and costs, incurred by the employee or consumer as a
result of the material breach.” Here, however, Plaintiff has not demonstrated
any reasonable expenses incurred “as result of the material breach.” Thus,
Plaintiff is not entitled to any sanctions, fees or costs pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1281.98(c) or
1281.99(a).
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion to
vacate the arbitration order is denied in its entirety.
