And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to compel arbitration of the plaintiff's claims. The defendants sought to compel arbitration based on an arbitration agreement executed by the plaintiff on May 14, 2021, which obligated her to arbitrate any employment-related disputes with the defendants. However, the judge found that the plaintiff's allegations of sexual harassment, which are part of her claims, are subject to the Ending the Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021 (EFAA), which precludes arbitration of such claims. The judge also found that the EFAA applies to all of the plaintiff's claims, not just the sexual harassment claim, and that the claims are therefore non-arbitrable.
