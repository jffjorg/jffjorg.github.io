DEMURRER
WITH MOTION TO STRIKE (ANZA)
 
 
Anza Management
Company (Defendant) demurs to Latasha
Williams and Antamari Wooley’s (Plaintiffs) fifth, sixth, seventh, and tenth causes
of action in their first amended complaint (FAC). Defendant also moves to
strike Plaintiffs’ requests for punitive damages, requests for excessive fees
under Civil Code section 789.3, and allegations concerning anonymous online
reviews. Defendant’s demurrer is sustained as to Plaintiffs’ sixth and tenth
causes of action and their motion to strike is granted in part. Plaintiffs are
granted leave to amend their complaint with respect to the tenth cause of
action.
 
A.    Legal Standard
 
A demurrer is
sustained where “[t]he pleading does not state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., 430.10, subd. (e).) “A demurrer tests the
legal sufficiency of the factual allegations in a complaint.” (Yalung v.
State (2023) 98 Cal.App.5th 71, 80.) In reviewing a complaint’s legal
sufficiency, a court will treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of law. (Esparza
v. Kaweah Delta Dist. Hospital (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 547, 552.) It is well
settled that a “demurrer lies only for defects appearing on the face of the
complaint[.]” (Stevens v. Superior Court
(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 594, 601.) “We not only treat the demurrer as admitting
all material facts properly pleaded, but also give the complaint a reasonable
interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.” (Guclimane Co. v. Stewart Tit. Guaranty Co.
(1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 38.) For purposes of ruling on a demurrer, the complaint
must be construed liberally by drawing reasonable inferences from the facts
pleaded. (Wilner v. Sunset Life Ins. Co.
(2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 952, 958.) 
 
When ruling
on a demurrer, a court may only consider the complaint’s allegations or matters
which may be judicially noticed. (Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311,
318.) The Court may not consider any other extrinsic evidence or judge the
credibility of the allegations pleaded or the difficulty a plaintiff may have
in proving his allegations. (Ion Equipment
Corporation v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 881.) A demurrer is
properly sustained only when the complaint, liberally construed, fails to state
facts sufficient to constitute any cause of action. (Kramer v. Intuit Inc. (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 574, 578.)
 
The Court
may, upon a motion, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems
proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any
pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd. (a).) The Court may also strike all or
any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this
state, a court rule, or an order of the Court. (Id., § 436, subd. (b).)
The grounds for a motion to strike are that the pleading has irrelevant, false
or improper matter, or has not been drawn or filed in conformity with laws. (Id.,
§ 436.) The grounds for moving to strike must appear on the face of the
pleading or by way of judicial notice. (Id., § 437.)
 
When a
demurrer is sustained, the Court determines whether there is a reasonable
possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment. (Blank, supra,
39 Cal.3d at p. 318).  When a plaintiff “has pleaded the general set of
facts upon which his cause of action is based,” the court should give the
plaintiff an opportunity to amend his complaint, since plaintiff should not “be
deprived of his right to maintain his action on the ground that his pleadings
were defective for lack of particulars.” (Reed v. Norman (1957) 152
Cal.App.2d 892, 900.) 
 
B.     Discussion
 
As a threshold matter, the declaration
of Taryn Jacobson submitted with Plaintiffs’ opposition to the present motion
is improper. Extrinsic evidence is not considered when evaluating a demurrer or
motion to strike, and thus the Court will not consider the declaration. 
 
Separately, Defendant argues in their
reply that demurrer is appropriate because Plaintiffs have not provided a copy
of the lease agreement. Defendant cites no authority requiring the production
of evidence to survive demurrer in a landlord tenant dispute based on a written
lease agreement. Indeed, Plaintiffs are not required to meet an evidentiary
burden to survive demurrer; only Plaintiffs’ first amended complaint and the
allegations therein are considered. Accordingly, Defendants’ demurrer is overruled
on this ground.
 
Defendant demurs to Plaintiffs’ first,
fifth, sixth, seventh, and tenth causes of action on the basis that Plaintiffs
have failed to plead facts sufficient to constitute such causes of action. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) Defendant also argues that the causes of
action are uncertain. (Id., § 430.10, subd. (f).) Defendant moves to
strike Plaintiffs’ requests for punitive damages, excessive fees under Civil
Code section 789.3, and allegations concerning anonymous reviews. (Id.,
§ 436, subd. (a).) The Court will address each argument in turn.
 
Plaintiffs have not named Defendant
under the first cause of action for breach of contract.
 
Defendant demurs to Plaintiffs’ first
cause of action for breach of breach of contract. However, Defendant is not
named under that cause of action, which applies only to Universal Pointe
Apartments, Inc. Thus, Defendant’s demurrer as to this cause of action is
superfluous. Accordingly, the Court overrules Defendant’s demurrer to the first
cause of action.
 
Plaintiffs have pled sufficient facts
to state their fifth cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional
distress.
 
Defendant demurs to Plaintiffs’ fifth
cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress on the basis
that Plaintiffs do not plead sufficient facts alleging outrageous conduct. A
claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress requires a showing of
“(1) outrageous conduct by the defendant; (2) the defendant’s intention of
causing or reckless disregard of the probability of causing emotional distress;
(3) the plaintiff’s suffering severe or extreme emotional distress; and (4)
actual and proximate causation of the emotional distress by the defendant’s
outrageous conduct.” (Huntingdon Life Sciences v. Stop Huntingdon Animal
Cruelty USA, Inc. (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 1228, 1259.) A defendant’s
conduct is ‘outrageous’ when it is so ‘extreme as to exceed all bounds of that
usually tolerated in a civilized community.’ [citation] And the defendant’s
conduct must be ‘intended to inflict injury or engaged in with the realization
that injury will result.’ [citation].” (Hughes v. Pair (2009) 46 Cal.4th
1035, 1050–1051.) This conduct must be alleged with specificity to avoid
demurrer. (Yau v. Santa Margarita Ford, Inc. (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 144,
161.)
 
Here, Plaintiffs allege that Defendant acted
in an outrageous manner by “intentionally ignoring and failing to keep the
Property clean, sanitary, and free from accumulations of debris, filth,
rubbish, and garbage, and by violating health and safety codes, ordinances,
regulations, and other laws.” (FAC ¶ 152.) Plaintiffs additionally allege that Defendant
knew of the Property’s untenantable state for years yet refused to remediate
the issue in a way that was offensive to common decency. (Id. ¶ 153.) Plaintiffs
further allege that their entire unit flooded due to faulty plumbing in 2023 and
Defendant failed to fix the damage to the unit after a month of Plaintiffs’
being displaced. (Id. ¶ 78.) Instead, Plaintiffs allege that Defendant offered
for Plaintiffs to sleep in the building’s recreational room, directly adjacent
to other tenants which Defendant knew to have previously harassed Plaintiffs. (Id.
¶ 71.) Additionally, Plaintiffs allege that they were subjected to racial
slurs by Defendant when expressing concerns. (Id. ¶ 36.) Taken together,
such alleged conduct by Defendant exceeds that which is usually tolerated by a
civilized society. Thus, Plaintiffs have pled specific facts constituting outrageous
conduct by Defendants.
 
Plaintiffs allege that Defendant acted
with reckless disregard of the probability that their behavior would cause
emotional distress (id. ¶ 155), and that Plaintiffs suffered severe
emotional distress because of Defendants’ conduct (id. ¶ 156–157). Thus,
Plaintiffs have pled facts sufficient to state a cause of action for
intentional infliction of emotional distress, and Plaintiffs’ pleading is not
uncertain. Accordingly, Defendants’ demurrer is overruled as to the fifth cause
of action.
 
Plaintiffs sixth cause of action for
private nuisance is duplicative.
 
Defendant demurs to Plaintiffs’ sixth
cause of action for private nuisance on the basis that it is uncertain. “Anything
which is injurious to health, including, but not limited to, the illegal sale
of controlled substances, or is indecent or offensive to the senses, or an
obstruction to the free use of property, so as to interfere with the
comfortable enjoyment of life or property . . . is a nuisance.” (Civ. Code, §
3479.) Private nuisances are those which do not affect “at the same time an
entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons.” (Id.
§§ 3480, 3481.) Importantly, “[t]he abatement of a nuisance does not prejudice
the right of any person to recover damages for its past existence.” (Id. §
3484.)
 
Here, Plaintiffs allege that the
conditions of the Property were a nuisance which Defendant failed to abate. (FAC
¶¶ 161–162.) Indeed, Plaintiffs’ allegations concerning their apartment’s
flooding and Defendants’ failure to fix the issue constitute an obstruction of
the free use of property as required by statute. Thus, Plaintiffs have pled
facts sufficient to state a cause of action for nuisance. 
 
Defendant argues that demurrer is
appropriate because Plaintiffs cannot seek injunctive relief given that they
vacated the premises months ago. However, Plaintiffs are entitled to seek
damages for the past existence of a nuisance under Civil Code section 3484.
 
Defendant additionally argues that
Plaintiffs’ private nuisance claim is duplicative of their second, third, and
eighth causes of action concerning habitability and negligence. Nuisance causes
of action concerning housing conditions are permitted, “[b]ut because of the
broad definition of nuisance, whether a cause of action is viable depends on
the facts of each case.” (El Escorial Owners’ Assn. v. DLC Plastering, Inc.
(2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 1337, 1348 (El Escorial).) For example, “[w]here
negligence and nuisance causes of action rely on the same facts about lack of
due care, the nuisance claim is a negligence claim.” (Id. at p. 1349.) Effectively,
if a nuisance cause of action is just a clone of a different cause of action
with a different label, demurrer is appropriate. (Ibid.) 
 
Here, Plaintiffs’ nuisance cause of
action rests on the same habitability defects underpinning Plaintiffs’ second
cause of action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, third cause of
action for violations of Civil Code section 1941, and eighth cause of action
for negligence. (FAC ¶¶ 161–162.) Thus, permitting Plaintiffs’ sixth cause of
action to go forward would risk allowing a traditional tort to be litigated
“under the guise of a nuisance action” as prohibited under El Escorial. (City
of San Diego v. U.S. Gypsum Co. (1995) 30 Cal.App.4th 575, 587.) Accordingly,
Defendants’ demurrer as to the sixth cause of action is sustained without leave
to amend.
 
Plaintiffs’ seventh cause of action for
unlawful actions by landlord influencing tenant to vacate is not duplicative.
 
Defendant argues that Plaintiffs’
seventh cause of action alleging violations of Civil Code section 1940.2 is
duplicative of other causes of action. Under section 1940.2, it is unlawful to
“[u]se, or threaten to use, force, willful threats, or menacing conduct
constituting a course of conduct that interferes with the tenant’s quiet
enjoyment of the premises” or to commit a significant or intentional violation
of section 1954, in an effort to influence a tenant to vacate a dwelling. (Civ.
Code, § 1940.2, subds. (a)(3), (a)(4).) Section 1954 limits the circumstances
in which a landlord may enter a dwelling unit.
 
Here, Plaintiffs allege that Defendant repeatedly
entered their unit in violation of section 1954. (FAC ¶ 170.) Plaintiffs
further allege that Defendant has interfered with Plaintiffs’ quiet enjoyment
of the property in a menacing fashion. (Id. ¶¶ 169, 173.) While
Plaintiffs’ second cause of action for breach of the covenant of quiet
enjoyment encapsulates similar conduct, that cause of action does not require a
showing of menacing conduct, or that the landlord acted with a purpose to
influence the tenant to vacate the premises. Similarly, Plaintiffs’ third and
fourth causes of action involve the same conduct, but once again do not require
a showing of purpose. Thus, Plaintiffs’ seventh cause of action is distinct,
requiring that additional elements be proven. Nor is the cause of action
uncertain. Plaintiffs make specific allegations regarding conduct alleged to be
intentional and coercive in violation of section 1940.2. Accordingly,
Defendants’ demurrer is overruled as to Plaintiffs’ seventh cause of action.
 
Plaintiffs have not pled facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action under the Unfair Competition Law.
 
Defendant argues that Plaintiffs have
not pled sufficient facts to support a cause of action for unfair competition.
Unfair competition includes “any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or
practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising.” (Bus. &
Prof. Code, § 17200.) A court may issue injunctive relief to “restore to any
person in interest any money or property, real or personal, which may have been
acquired by means of such unfair competition.” (Id., § 17203.) A party
alleging unfair competition under section 17200 must “state with reasonable
particularity the facts supporting the statutory elements of the violation.” (Khoury
v. Maly’s of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 619 (Khoury).)
 
A business practice may be unfair in
violation of the unfair competition law even if the practice does not violate
any law. (Olszewski v. Scripps Health (2003) 30 Cal.4th 798, 827.) “The
test of whether a business practice is unfair ‘involves an examination of [its]
impact on its alleged victim, balanced against the reasons, justifications and
motives of the alleged wrongdoer. In brief, the court must weigh the utility of
the defendant’s conduct against the gravity of the harm to the alleged victim.”
(Candelore v. Tinder, Inc. (2018) 19 Cal.App.5th 1138, 1155.)
 
Here, Plaintiffs allege that all
statutory violations committed by Defendant and any breach of the implied
warranty of habitability also constitute unfair business practices. (FAC ¶¶
210–211.) Plaintiffs seek restitution for rent paid pursuant to Business and
Professions Code section 17200. (Id. ¶ 214.) In merely alleging that all
unlawful actions by Defendant violate section 17200, Plaintiffs have failed to
state with any particularity specific business practices supporting the cause
of action. Such conclusory allegations are insufficient to survive demurrer. Accordingly,
Defendants’ demurrer is sustained as to Plaintiffs’ tenth cause of action.
Plaintiffs are granted leave to amend. 
 
C.     Motion to Strike
 
Defendant moves to strike Plaintiffs’
prayer for punitive damages and all paragraphs referencing punitive damages in
the complaint. A plaintiff may recover punitive damages where it is proven by
clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of oppression,
fraud, or malice. (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (a).) Malice is defined as conduct
intended to injure the plaintiff or despicable conduct by a defendant acting
with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights and safety of others. (Id.,
§ 3294, subd. (c)(1).) Oppression means despicable conduct subjecting a person
to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of their rights. (Id.,
§ 3294, subd. (c)(2).) And fraud refers to intentional misrepresentations or
concealment of a material fact known to the defendant. (Id., § 3294,
subd. (c)(3).)
 
Here, Plaintiffs plead facts justifying
punitive damages. Plaintiffs allege that Defendant acted maliciously by
exhibiting a conscious disregard for the rights and safety of others. Specifically,
Plaintiffs allege that Defendant had constructive knowledge of the issues with
the property due to multiple government notices and complaints from Plaintiffs
and other tenants, and could ascertain the issues with the property upon visual
inspection. (FAC ¶ 100.) Indeed, Defendants’ awareness of the issues with the
property could justify a finding that Defendant acted with malice under section
3294. Additionally, Plaintiffs allege intentional conduct by Defendant meant to
influence them to vacate the premises. (Id. ¶¶ 171–172, 176.) When
ruling on a motion to strike, the Court must take the facts pleaded as true,
and such alleged conduct could constitute malice or oppression as well. Thus, Plaintiffs
have pled specific facts sufficient to justify a request for punitive damages. Accordingly,
Defendants’ motion to strike on this ground is denied.
 
Defendant also argues that Plaintiffs’
requests for damages in excess of $100 per violation pursuant to Civil Code
section 789.3 should be stricken. That section prohibits a landlord from “willfully
[causing], directly or indirectly, the interruption or termination of any
utility service furnished the tenant” with the intent to terminate the
occupancy under a lease. (Civ. Code, § 789.3, subd. (a).) A landlord who
violates this section is liable for any actual damages to the tenant and an
additional $100 for each day the landlord remains in violation. (Id., §
789.3, subd. (c)(2).) Each separate cause of action under section 789.3 shall
entitle the plaintiff to an award of at least $250. (Ibid.)
 
Here, Plaintiffs allege that Defendant is
liable for “special damages of not less than $100 per violation, and not more
than $250 for each day the landlord remains in violation [of section 789.3].” (FAC
¶ 140.) In doing so, Plaintiffs misstate the special damages authorized under
section 789.3. Under statute, Plaintiffs are entitled to a maximum $100 in
special damages per day that utility services were interrupted. However, if the
period of interruption is under three days, Plaintiffs are still entitled to a
minimum of $250 in special damages. Thus, each non-consecutive period of
interruption justifies a special damages award of at least $250, but for
periods of interruption longer than two days damages are limited to $100 per
day. Plaintiffs’ assertions to the contrary constitute a false matter contained
in a pleading, strikable under Code of Civil Procedure section 436, subdivision
(a). Accordingly, Defendants’ motion to strike on this ground is granted.
 
Finally, Defendant argues that the
anonymous online reviews alleged in Plaintiffs FAC are improper hearsay. “Hearsay
evidence is evidence of a statement that was made other than by a witness while
testifying at the hearing and that is offered to prove the truth of the matter
stated.” (Evid. Code, § 1200.) Hearsay evidence is inadmissible. (Ibid.)
Here, the statements offered by Plaintiffs are not hearsay because they are not
offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, namely the problems with the
property. Rather, the statements could be used to demonstrate that Defendant was
made aware of the issues with the property. (FAC ¶ 52.) Thus, they do not
constitute improper material contained in a pleading. Moreover, a motion to
strike is not the proper vehicle for objecting to potential hearsay evidence.
Pleadings may contain hearsay, provided that it is relevant, even if such
statements are inadmissible at trial. Accordingly, Defendants’ motion to strike
on this ground is denied.
 
Conclusion:
 
Defendants’
demurrer is sustained as to the sixth and tenth causes of action. With respect
to the tenth cause of action, Plaintiffs are granted leave to amend. Defendants’
motion to strike is granted as to Plaintiffs’ improper characterization of the
remedies owed under section 789.3 only. 15 days leave to amend.
