And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge tentatively denies the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to the defendant's objections to the request for production of documents. The court finds that the plaintiff's motion is procedurally defective due to the lack of a meet and confer declaration and a separate statement providing factual and legal reasons for compelling further responses. The court also notes that the plaintiff's counsel failed to make a serious attempt to negotiate with the defendant's counsel to resolve the dispute.
