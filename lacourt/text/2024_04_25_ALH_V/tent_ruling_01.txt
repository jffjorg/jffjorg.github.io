[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:
PLAINTIFF VICTORIA SOLIS’ MOTION
TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR 
PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS, SET 
ONE
MOVING PARTIES: Plaintiff Victoria Solis
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc.
Motion to Compel Further Responses To Plaintiff’s Request For Production of Documents, 
Set Two, Nos. 1 through 31
The court considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection 
with this motion.  BACKGROUND
This is a Lemon Law case brought by Plaintiff Victoria Solis involving a 2020 Acura 
MDX, bearing VIN: 5J8YD4H37LL045552 (“Subject Vehicle”). On October 31, 2023, Plaintiff 
filed the complaint against Defendants American Honda Motor Co., Inc. (“AHM”) and Colorado 
Development Corporation dba Acura of Glendale. The causes of action in the Complaint arise out of the warranty and repair obligations of AHM in connection with the Subject Vehicle for 
which AHM issued a written warranty. The warranty was not issued by the selling dealership.
On or about December 20, 2023, Plaintiff propounded Request for Production of 
Documents, Set One, on AHM seeking documents relating to: (1) Plaintiff’s own vehicle 
(Request Nos. 1-14); (2) AHM’s written warranties and the policies and procedures related to 
what is covered under said warranties, how coverage is determined, training related to warranty 
coverage, how customer complaints are handled, and whether AHM abides by its duties under 
the Song-Beverly Act (Request Nos. 15-29); and (3) AHM’s knowledge of the same or similar 
defects in other vehicles of the same year, make, and model as the Subject Vehicle. (Request 
Nos. 30-31). 
On or about January 23, 2024, AHM responded to Plaintiff’s requests with objections. 
On March 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Compel Further Responses to 
Plaintiff´s Request for Production of Documents, Set One, Request Nos. 1 through 31.
LEGAL STANDARD In responding to a demand for production of documents, a party must either provide one 
of the following: (1) a legally adequate statement of compliance; (2) a statement of inability to 
comply; or (3) an objection to the particular demand. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.210, subd. 
(a).) If any objections are made, they must: (1) “[i]dentify with particularity any document … 
falling within any category of item in the demand to which an objection is being made”; and (2) 
“[s]et forth clearly the extent of, and the specific ground for, the objection.” (Id., § 2031.240, 
subd. (b).)
To prevail, a party moving for an order compelling further responses to a document 
production demand must first offer facts demonstrating “good cause justifying the discovery 
sought by the demand.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1).) This burden “is met simply 
by a fact-specific showing of relevance.” (TBG Ins. Servs. Corp. v. Superior Court (2002) 96 
Cal.App.4th 443, 448.) If “good cause” is shown by the moving party, the burden shifts to the  responding party to justify any objections made to document disclosure. (Kirkland v. Superior 
Court (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 92, 98.)
DISCUSSION
Motions to compel further responses to written discovery must be accompanied by a meet 
and confer declaration (Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040), setting forth facts evincing a “reasonable 
and good faith attempt an informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (Code 
Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).) In support of the meet and confer requirement, Plaintiff’s 
counsel attaches two letters that purportedly attempted to meet and confer with AHM. (Derderian
Decl. ¶ 19, Exh. 5.) Both letters are plainly boilerplate and fail to “state facts showing a 
reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the 
motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.) Even considering Defendant’s failure to respond the 
Plaintiff’s letters, it is evident from the attached letters that counsel made no serious “attempt to 
talk the matter over, compare their views, consult, and deliberate.” (Clement v. Alegre (2009) 
177 Cal.App.4th 1277, 1294.)
For that reason alone, the court could deny the motion as procedurally defective. But 
here, the motion further fails because the separate statement provided with the motion to compel 
does not include “[a] statement of the factual and legal reasons for compelling further responses, 
answers or production to each matter in dispute.” Indeed, Plaintiffs separate statement offers 
additional boilerplate without providing specific reasons to compel further responses based on 
each matter in dispute.
Based on the foregoing, the court DENIES the Motion to Compel Further Responses To 
Plaintiff’s Request For Production of Documents, Set Two, Nos. 1 through 31.
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
