And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions for protective order filed by the plaintiff. The plaintiff is seeking to avoid answering certain discovery requests from the defendants, including admissions, interrogatories, and special interrogatories. The judge denied the first motion for protective order in its entirety, finding that the plaintiff did not provide sufficient evidence to support the requested relief. The judge granted the second motion for protective order in part, finding that one of the admission requests is duplicative and should be avoided. The judge denied the motion in all other respects. The moving party is required to give notice of the ruling.
