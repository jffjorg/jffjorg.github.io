And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is based on the information presented before today's hearing. The case involves a wrongful foreclosure action brought by Plaintiff Robert D. Moore III against Defendants Bank of America, N.A. and Quality Loan Service Corporation. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants are attempting to foreclosure on his property without a proper Notice of Default (NOD) and that the foreclosure would be wrongful. The Plaintiff also alleges that the Defendants have not sent him a new NOD in 7 years and that they have refused to give his new lender a statement regarding the payment.

The Judge has ruled on several motions, including the demurrer filed by Bank of America, N.A. The Judge has overruled the demurrer to the 1st cause of action, which seeks a declaratory judgment, and sustained the demurrer to the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th causes of action, which seek to prohibit or set aside the trustee's sale, prohibit or void the trustee's deed upon sale, quiet title, and claim all equity proceeds in the event of a foreclosure sale.

The Judge has also addressed the Plaintiff's claims that the foreclosure would be wrongful and that the Defendants have not sent him a new NOD in 7 years. The Judge has ruled that the Plaintiff's claims are sufficient to state a cause of action and that the Defendants cannot attack the merits of the Plaintiff's claim on demurrer. The Judge has also ruled that the Plaintiff's claims for quiet title and to claim all equity proceeds in the event of a foreclosure sale are premature and that the Plaintiff's claim for unjust enrichment is not a cause of action.
