And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for trial preference filed by plaintiff Sara Salgado. The plaintiff is seeking a trial preference under California Code of Civil Procedure § 36, which allows for a party over the age of 70 to be given preference in scheduling a trial if their health is such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing their interest in the litigation. The plaintiff, who is 79 years old, claims that she was injured by each of the defendants while a patient at their facilities and that her prognosis is poor due to her medical conditions. The plaintiff's counsel has filed a declaration stating that the plaintiff's medical records and communications with her son confirm her poor prognosis and that she requires 24/7 around-the-clock care. The defendants, however, argue that the plaintiff has not shown that her interests would be prejudiced without a trial preference.

The judge has denied the motion for trial preference without prejudice, meaning that the plaintiff may refile the motion with additional evidence or arguments. The judge found that the plaintiff's showing did not satisfy the burden under CCP § 36, as the plaintiff failed to demonstrate that her interests would be prejudiced without a trial preference.
