And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for relief from dismissal filed by Plaintiff Amy Derry. The case is about a rental agreement between Plaintiff and Defendants Khanh Mai and Nhat Bui. Plaintiff alleges that the property was not ready for occupancy, and she experienced unhabitable conditions. The case was settled in open court on April 18, 2023, and Plaintiff received a large cash settlement. However, Plaintiff now seeks to set aside the dismissal and reopen the case, alleging that the settlement was not in good faith and that her prior attorney, Isaac Toveg, made a mistake in dismissing the case.

The Judge has denied Plaintiff's motion, finding that the dismissal was proper and that Plaintiff has not shown excusable mistake or neglect to warrant relief under CCP § 473(b). The Judge also notes that Plaintiff has not provided the terms of the settlement agreement, making it difficult to determine how to enforce the settlement or what specific relief Plaintiff is seeking. The Judge has retained jurisdiction to address any concerns regarding the settlement agreement, but Plaintiff has not set forth a breach of the settlement by any party.
