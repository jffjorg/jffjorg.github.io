Kvistad (1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 836, 840.) The court must confirm the award as made, unless it corrects or vacates the award, or dismisses the proceeding.  (CCP § 1286; Valsan Partners Limited Partnership v. Calcor Space Facility, Inc. (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 809, 818.)  CCP § 1285.4 states the requirements of a petition. The Petition complies with the section 1285.4 requirements.The Petition includes a copy of the agreement to arbitrate (i.e., the underlying written agreement between the parties), which is attached as Attachment 4(b) to the petition. The Petition sets forth the name of the arbitrator.  The arbitration was conducted by Peg Donahue Hall on April 6, 2023.  (Pet., ¶¶6-7.) The Petition sets forth or provides a copy of the award and the written award of the arbitrator.  (Pet., Attachment 8(c).)  According to the arbitrator’s Award, Petitioner appeared and Respondents failed to appear to the arbitration hearing.  The arbitrator reviewed the evidence and determined that Respondents owed to Petitioner $100,996.94 in damages, $1,428 in legal fees, $20 for Returned Item Fee, $67.37 for credit card surcharge as an expense for filing the arbitration, and $5,775 for arbitration fees.  This totals $108,287.31.  (Pet., Attachment 8C.) According to the petition, Petitioner seeks confirmation of the Award and enter judgment according to it.  (Pet., ¶10.)  Petitioner also seeks interest at the statutory rate, $435 in costs of suit, $2,972.87 in attorney’s fees (if default), and prejudgment interest from the date of the award from June 1, 2023 to the date of entry of judgment.  (Id.)          Thus, there is substantive merit to granting this petition. CONCLUSION AND ORDER         Petitioner Swift Financial, LLC as servicing agent for WebBank’s petition to confirm the Award of Arbitrator is granted against Respondent Brand Restaurant Group Inc. d/b/a Kaviar Sushi Bar and Tigran Oganessian.
