Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is continuing the hearing on the motion to compel further responses from Ford Motor Company. The motion was filed by the plaintiff, Justin Whiter, who is seeking reimbursement or replacement for a 2019 Ford Fusion vehicle that he alleges contained defects. The defendant, Ford Motor Company, filed an opposition brief and the plaintiff filed reply papers. The judge is also considering the potential bias due to the judicial officer's prior representation of Ford Motor Company and is giving the parties an opportunity to raise objections and request recusal. If the parties do not object, the hearing will be continued to March 1, 2024.
