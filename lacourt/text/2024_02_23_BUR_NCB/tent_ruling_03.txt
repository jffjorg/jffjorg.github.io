During that time he worked on Ford Motor Company matters, principally on products liability cases from 1976 (when he was a summer associate) until 1987. Ford was a major client during his partnership with the firm, and so some portion of his partner draw would have originated with Ford. The Court does not feel that it is biased in this matter as the result of this long ago legal representation but recognizes that the parties may have a different perception. If any party feels that the Court’s prior work at Hughes Hubbard creates an appearance of bias, please file an appropriate request for the Court to recuse prior to the next hearing in this matter. It is not necessary to file a peremptory challenge under CCP 170.6.At the February 16, 2024 hearing, Plaintiff’s counsel represented that they were seeking approval from their law firm to seek a recusal of the judicial officer from this matter.  The Court will inquire as to the status of this approval at the hearing. CONCLUSION AND ORDERThe parties are ordered to attend the hearing.  Prior the hearing, counsel should discuss with their clients whether they would like this case to proceed in this Department.  If the parties have objections, they should be raised at the hearing so that the Court may take appropriate steps to recuse itself from the action and transfer the case.If the parties are willing to waive these issues, then the Court will continue the hearing on the motion to compel further responses to March 1, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.  No further briefing will be permitted on the motion.
