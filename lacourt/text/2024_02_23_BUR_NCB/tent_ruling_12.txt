Code, §17200); (4) successor-in-interest liability; (5) creditor’s suit; (6) preliminary and permanent injunctive relief; (7) action against guarantor on guaranty; and (8) declaratory relief.  The 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 6th, and 8th causes of action were against all Cross-Defendants.  The 4th, 5th, and 7th causes of action were against Koygani and Grigorian. On April 18, 2022, the Court held a hearing regarding the status of representation of Secret Recipes, Inc. (“SRI”).  The Court struck the SAC filed on November 28, 2016 as to SRI only, as well as all pleadings filed on behalf of SRI only.  On May 4, 2022, the default of SRI was entered “per Court’s order dated April 18, 2022.”On July 15, 2022, the Court granted Lopez and Rodriguez’s motion to dismiss this action based on the Five-Year Rule.  The Court ordered Lopez, Rodriguez, and Loracast, Inc. in the SAC filed by Grigorian et al. on November 28, 2016 to be dismissed without prejudice.  The Court noted that the Fifth[1] Amended Cross-Complaint (filed February 23, 2021) was still pending in the action.On September 12, 2022, Defendants Lopez and Rodriguez moved for $172,932.50 in attorney’s fees pursuant to the Court’s July 15, 2022 order dismissing Plaintiffs SRI, Grigorian, and Koygani’s complaint.  The Court granted the motion for attorney’s fees on December 9, 2022 in the total amount of $143,135.50. The matter came for a non-jury trial on December 12, 2022.  At the trial, Cross-Complainants Lopez and Rodriguez orally moved to dismiss the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 8th causes of action with prejudice.  (The Court notes that the minute order incorrectly notes that “Plaintiff” orally moved to dismiss these causes of action.)  As such, the only remaining cause of action in Cross-Complainants’ TAXC was the 7th cause of action. On January 3, 2023, the Court entered the Judgment After Trial by Court.  The Judgment stated in relevant part on page 4:Defendants/Cross-Complainants Felix Lopez and Luis Rodrigues [sic] are entitled to judgment against Hovik Grigorian and Andreh Koygani and Secret Recipes jointly and severally in the amount of $211,703.40 on the seventh cause of action for enforcement of guaranty.Per Court’s order dated December 9, [20]22, Defendants and Cross-Complainants were awarded $143,135.00 in Attorney’s fees incurred for defense of the complaint.
