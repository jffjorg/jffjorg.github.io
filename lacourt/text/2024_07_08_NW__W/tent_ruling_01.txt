DISCUSSION
 
Defendant Helen Godoy Maranan moves the
court for an order that the truth of each matter specified in the Requests for
Admissions, Set One be deemed admitted and conclusively established, as well as
an order to serve verified answers without objections to Form Interrogatories,
Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Demand for Production and
Inspection of Documents, Set One. 
 
Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests,
the court may make an order compelling responses. (CCP §§ 2030.290, 2031.300,
2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails to
serve a timely response to the discovery request waives any objection to the
request, including one based on privilege or the protection of attorney work
product. (CCP §§2030.290(a), 2031.300(a), 2033.280(a); Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 404.)
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may
also move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of
any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a
monetary sanction. (CCP § 2033.280(b).)
 
On February 19, 2024, Defendant propounded discovery requests including
Request for Admissions, Set One, Form Interrogatories, Set One, Special
Interrogatories, Set One, and Demand for Production and Inspection of
Documents, Set One. (Garibyan Decl. ¶3.) Plaintiff’s responses were due on
March 22, 2024. (Garibyan Decl. ¶3, Exh. A.) On April 2, 2024, Plaintiff served
unverified responses. (Garibyan Decl. ¶4, Exh. B.) On April 8, 2024, defense counsel
sent plaintiff a meet and confer letter, requesting that plaintiff serve
verified discovery responses by April 19, 2024. (Garibyan Decl. ¶5, Exh. C.)
Defendant did not receive any responses by April 19, 2024. (Garibyan Decl. ¶6.)
At the time of this filing, Defendant has still not received any verified
responses. (Garibyan Decl. ¶7.) 
 
No opposition has been filed. Accordingly, Defendant’s Motion for Order
Deeming Facts Admitted as to Defendant’s Request for Admissions, Set One;
Motion for Order Compelling Plaintiff Jose Carlos Munoz to Provide Verified
Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One; Motion for Order Compelling
Plaintiff Jose Carlos Munoz to Provide Verified Responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set One; and Motion for Order Compelling Plaintiff Jose Carlos
Munoz to Provide Verified Responses to Demand for Production and Inspection of
Documents, Set One are GRANTED. 
 
Sanctions
 
Defendant seeks $561.65 in attorney fees per motion, $2,246.60 total. If
a propounding party moves for and obtains a court order compelling a response,
the court shall impose monetary sanctions against the party failing to timely
respond to interrogatories and demands for inspection unless that party acted
with substantial justification or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. (CCP
§§ 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c), 2033.280(c); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 404.) 
 
The court GRANTS the request for attorney fees in the reduced amount of
$1,496.60, payable by plaintiff within 30 days.
