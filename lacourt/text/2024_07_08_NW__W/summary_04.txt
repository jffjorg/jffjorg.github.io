And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Simon Asulin, has demurred to the plaintiff's complaint, alleging that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a claim. The court has ruled that the demurrer to the first cause of action for assault is overruled, as the complaint adequately alleges intent to cause harmful or offensive contact. The court has also ruled that the demurrer to the second cause of action for battery is overruled, as the complaint adequately alleges intent to harm or offend. The court has further ruled that the demurrer to the third cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress is overruled, as the complaint adequately alleges extreme and outrageous conduct. Finally, the court has ruled that the demurrer to the fourth cause of action for extortion is overruled, as the complaint adequately alleges threats to the plaintiff's life and extortion of money.

The court has also denied the defendant's motion to strike each cause of action as being conclusory, as well as the motion to strike punitive damages. The court has found that the plaintiff's allegations of a violent and intentional assault, extortion, and threats to the plaintiff's life are sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages.
