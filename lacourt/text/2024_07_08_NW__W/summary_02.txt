Summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by defendants LoanDepot.com LLC and Mr. Cooper to the complaint filed by plaintiff Troy Mitchell Diamond. The defendants argue that the complaint is barred by the statute of limitations and fails to allege facts sufficient to constitute any actionable claim against them. The court agrees with the defendants and sustains the demurrer with limited leave to amend. The court finds that the plaintiff cannot plead delayed discovery and that the appeals did not toll the statute of limitations for more than 9 months. The plaintiff may have leave to amend to clarify that the defendants are named only as valid lienholders and that no monetary damages are sought against them.
