And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving an unlawful detainer action brought by BVK Courtyard Commons, LLC against Calabasas Medical Center, Inc. The plaintiff is seeking to recover attorney fees and costs in the amount of $28,645.50 and $2,480.00, respectively. The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and now must determine the amount of attorney fees to be awarded.

The judge notes that the plaintiff is entitled to recover attorney fees and costs as the prevailing party under the lease agreement, which provides for the recovery of reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses incurred in connection with the suit. However, the judge is unable to fully determine whether the hours expended by the plaintiff's attorneys are reasonable, as the billing statements provided are missing pages.

The judge has therefore continued the motion for attorney fees, requiring the plaintiff to submit complete billing records. The judge has granted the memorandum of costs in the amount of $2,480.00, which includes fees for filing and motion fees, service of process fees, in-court reporter fees, and electronic filing or service fees.
