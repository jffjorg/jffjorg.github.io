BACKGROUND
 
This is an unlawful detainer action. On April 16, 2020, Plaintiff
conveyed to JANA, LLC a leasehold interest in the Premises for a term of
approximately ten years. On March 10, 2022, JANA assigned the Lease to Tenant.
Plaintiff alleges Tenant breached the Lease by failing to pay Rent and on
November 21, 2023, Plaintiff notified Tenant in writing that it had defaulted
in its payment of Rent. Despite the written notice, Plaintiff alleges Tenant
failed to bring its Rent current and on January 24, 2024, Plaintiff served
Tenant with a statutory Five Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit. 
 
On May 1, 2024, this court granted Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary
Judgment and entered judgment in Plaintiff’s favor on May 16, 2024. Plaintiff
now seeks attorney fee and costs. 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Plaintiff’s Motion to Fix Attorney Fees is CONTINUED. 
 
discussion
 
Plaintiff BVK Courtyard Commons LLC moves this
court to fix attorney fees in the amount of $28,645.50 pursuant to California
Civil Code section 1717. This motion is made on the grounds that Plaintiff is
the prevailing party under the contract that provides for the recovery of
attorney fees and costs. 
 
In any action “on a contract” that provides for
the prevailing party’s recovery of attorneys’ fees, the prevailing party “shall
be entitled to [an award of] reasonable attorneys’ fees.”¿ (Civ. Code, § 1717;
see also Drybread v. Chipain Chiropractic Corp. (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th
1063, 1071 (Drybread) (in action arising out of lease agreement,
prevailing party entitled to attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses incurred).) 
 
Here, Plaintiff presents a copy of the lease
agreement underlying Plaintiff’s complaint. (Byrne Decl., Exh. A.) The lease
includes an attorney fees provision which states, “In the event it becomes for
either party hereto to file suit to enforce this Lease or any provision
contained herein, the prevailing party in such suit shall be entitled to
recover, in addition to all other remedies or damages, as provided herein,
reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses incurred in connection with such suit.”
(Byrne Decl., Exh. A, ¶43.) On May 1, 2024, the court granted Plaintiff’s
motion for summary judgment finding Defendant was in possession of the premises
after defaulting on payment of the lease. (Bryne Decl., Exh. B.) Accordingly,
Plaintiff is entitled to recover their attorney fees and costs against
Defendant as the prevailing party. 
 
Plaintiff seeks to recover $28,645.50 in attorney
fees, representing billing at an hourly rate from $150 to $295. (Byrne Decl.
¶6, Exh. C.) The trial court will award reasonable attorneys’ fees according to
the lodestar.¿ (See PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1096;
see also Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.) The court finds
the hourly rate reasonable for a firm of their experience and expertise.
However, the court is unable to fully determine whether the hours expended are
reasonable. Plaintiff does not provide the hours spent and while billing
statements are not required to recover attorney fees, the billing statements
provided are missing pages. Based on the records actually presented, it would
appear the attorney’s fees are more in the order of $10,000. (See Invoice 2787;
see Steiny and Company, Inc. v. California Electric Supply Company, Inc.
(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 285, 293.) 
 
Accordingly, the motion for attorney fees is
CONTINUED, for plaintiff to submit complete billing records. 
 
Memorandum of Costs
 
Plaintiff seeks $2,480.00 in costs including
$935.00 for filing and motion fees, $190.00 in service of process fees, $906.00
in in court reporter fees, and $449.00 in fees for electronic filing or service
fees. 
 
The Memorandum of Costs is GRANTED.
