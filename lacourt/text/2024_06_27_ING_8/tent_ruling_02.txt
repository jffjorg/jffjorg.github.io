RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant,
Count of Los Angeles
¿¿ 
MOTION:¿                              (1) Motion to Tax Costs
¿ 
Tentative Rulings:                  (1)  DENY.  If a
portion of the service of the questioned SDT fees were for witness fees, would
they not be separately recoverable cost items?  Don’t the invoices attached to the Yap
Declaration show a detailed breakdown of the costs such as the thousands of
pages of medical records, e.g., 2,347 pages at Kaiser Oakland?
 
 
 
I. BACKGROUND¿¿ 
¿¿ 
A. Factual¿¿ 
¿ 
On September 8, 2022, Plaintiffs, Daniel Luna and Irena
Sulencka (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed a Complaint against Defendants, Los
Angeles Rams, Hollywood Park Management Co. II, LLC, KSE Sportsman Media, Inc.,
Stockbridge Capital Group, LLC, Apex Security Group, Inc., Bryan Alexis
Cifuentes, and DOES 1 through 100. On May 12, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a First
Amended Complaint. On  October 2, 2023,
Plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint. On December 22, 2023, Plaintiffs
filed a Third Amended Complaint (“TAC”) alleging causes of action for: (1)
Negligence; (2) Premises Liability; (3) Assault; (4) Battery; (5) Loss of
Consortium; (6) Public Employee Negligence; and (7) Mandatory Duty pursuant to
Gov. Code § 815.6. 
 
On February 28, 2024, this Court sustained, without leave
to amend, County of Los Angeles’ demurrer to the TAC. 
 
Subsequently, on May 6, 2024, County filed a memorandum of
costs seeking to be awarded $7,052.64 in costs associated with litigation. On
that same day, county filed a Notice of Entry of Judgment in favor of County. 
 
Now, Plaintiffs file a Motion to tax costs claimed by the
prevailing party County. 
 
B. Procedural¿¿ 
¿ 
On May 23, 2024, Plaintiffs
filed a Motion to Tax Costs. On June 13, 2024, Defendant, County filed an
opposition brief with a supporting declaration of Mr. Yap attaching a series of
billing invoices detailing the records and other charges for subpoenaed records.
To date, no reply brief has been filed. 
 
¿II.
ANALYSIS¿ 
 
A.    Legal
Standard 
 
“Any notice of motion to strike or to tax costs must be
served and filed 15 days after service of the costs memorandum.  If the
cost memorandum was served by mail, the period is extended as provided in Code
of Civil Procedure section 1013.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1700(b)(1).)  The failure to timely file a motion to tax or strike costs
constitutes a waiver of the right to object to costs, unless the Court in its
discretion grants relief under Code of Civil Procedure Section 473, such as
based upon a finding of excusable neglect.  (Douglas v. Willis
(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 287, 289; see also Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700(b)(3)
[“The party claiming costs and the party contesting costs may agree to extend
the time for serving and filing the cost memorandum and a motion to strike or
tax costs.  This agreement must be confirmed in writing, specify the
extended date for service, and be filed with the clerk.  In the absence of
an agreement, the court may extend the times for serving and filing the cost
memorandum or the notice of motion to strike or tax costs for a period not to
exceed 30 days.”].) 
 
A prevailing party claiming
costs must file and serve a memorandum of costs either (1) within 15 days after
the date of service of a notice of entry of judgment or dismissal by the clerk
under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.5, (2) 15 days after the service of
written notice of entry of judgment or dismissal, or (3) within 180 days after
entry of judgment, whichever is first. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700, subd. (a).) Any motion to
strike or tax costs must be served and filed 15 days after service of
the memorandum, plus an additional 5 days if served by mail or 2 days if served
electronically. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700, subd. (b)(1).) “Unless objection
is made to the entire cost memorandum, the motion to strike or tax costs must
refer to each item objected to by the same number and appear in the same order
as the corresponding cost item claimed on the memorandum of costs and must
state why the item is objectionable.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700, subd. (b)(2).) 
 
California Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5,
subdivision (a), sets forth items allowable as costs.  And section 1033.5,
subdivision (b) lists the items that are not allowable as costs.  The
court has discretion to allow costs that are not barred by subdivision (b) but
are not listed under subdivision (a).  (Science Applications
International Corporation v. Superior Court (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1095,
1103.)  If an item of costs is expressly allowed by statute and if items
appear on their face to be proper, the verified memorandum of costs is prima
facie evidence of their propriety, shifting the burden of proof to the
objecting party to show that the items are not “reasonably necessary to the
conduct of the litigation” or “reasonable in amount.”  (Benach v.
County of L. A. (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 836, 855; (Nelson v. Anderson
(1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 131-32 [“trial court erred in requiring additional
proof from” the party claiming costs, where the party attacking costs had the
burden]; Santantonio v. Westinghouse Broad. Co. (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th
102, 116, 121 [after a prima facie showing based on verified cost memorandum,
objecting party has the burden to prove costs should be disallowed]; Ladas
v. Cal. State Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 773.)  But if an
item of cost does not appear proper on its face, the burden of showing that it
is reasonable and necessary shifts to the party claiming the cost.  (Nelson
v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 131; Jones v. Dumrichob
(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1258, 1267; but see Bach v. County of Butte (1989)
215 Cal.App.3d 294, 308 ["Only after such costs are challenged by a motion
to tax do the parties need to justify their claims by submitting documentation
of the costs they have incurred."].) 
Accordingly, the court must determine whether section 1033.5 expressly
allows the particular item and whether it appears proper on its face. 
(See Nelson, supra, 72 Cal.App.4th at 131.)  
 
B.     Discussion
 
Here,
Plaintiffs move on this Motion to Tax Costs, seeking to tax Item No. 5 of Defendant’s
claimed costs. Plaintiffs note that Item No. 5 of County’s memorandum of costs
seeks recovery of $5,280.64 in service of process costs.  Plaintiffs contend that Defendants provide no
explanation of what was served and by what method of service and did not
provide a copy of the relevant proofs of service. As such, Plaintiff asserts
that they do not have a way of evaluating Defendant’s claim of costs under this
item and thus, Defendant has failed to establish the necessity of
reasonableness of the service costs. 
 
Further,
Plaintiffs contend that items 5(a)-(d) and (g)-(h) appear to be for registered
service of process on health care providers. However, without more information
about what was served and how it was served, Plaintiffs assert that they are
required to infer that these items refer to subpoenas for medical records
relating to Plaintiff Luna’s injuries. Plaintiffs argue that these were not
necessary to the litigation of County’s case. Plaintiffs notes that they
responded to County’s document request on August 1, 2023, stating that Daniel
Luna would produce his medical records they sought from Plaintiffs through
discovery, and as such, Plaintiffs argue it was unnecessary to also incur costs
on service of process of subpoenas on the health care providers themselves. Plaintiffs
further note that if County reviewed the documents produced by Plaintiffs and
determined or sought to determine that they were insufficient, the service of
subpoenas may have been reasonably necessary, however, Plaintiffs contend there
is no indication this was the case. However, Plaintiffs do not indicate that they
did in fact produce the records that the County later subpoenaed, or if they
did make such a production whether they were for the same number of pages of
records form each subpoenaed provider.
 
In
opposition, County argues that pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure 1033.5,
subdivision (a)(4), County may recover its service of process costs. First,
County contends that its memorandum of costs clearly identifies who was served,
who served the process, and the respective costs. Second, County argues that
their service of subpoenas was necessary and that they do not need to rely on
Plaintiffs to obtain Mr. Luna’s relevant medical records, as they would have no
idea to ensure it obtained an accurate and complete set of Mr. Luna’s medical
records. Moreover, they note that there is no way for County to have the
medical records authenticated by Plaintiff, and thus, in order to have them
submitted into evidence, they would need to subpoena the medical providers. Moreover,
attached to the Declaration of Mr. Yap in support of the opposition to this
motion are the service of process documents, invoices, and other records addressing
the shifted burden to the party claiming the costs to justify the amount
claimed after being challenged by the plaintiffs.  Some of the invoices also indicate that they
are for items such as: “Base Fee – Deposition Officer,” and “Witness Fees.” Most
of the invoices attached to the Yap Declaration describe the number of pages of
records copied and produced and other fees provided, with an itemized breakdown
of the total costs of each subpoena.  In
the Court’s view, this is sufficient compliance with what Plaintiff found to be
lacking in the Cost Bill.  
 
 
III. CONCLUSION¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’
Motion to Tax Costs is DENIED.  Unless
waived, Defendant is to give notice of this ruling.   The
Clerk is directed to amend the defense judgment to include the $7,052.64 in costs awarded.
