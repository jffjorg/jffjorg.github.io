Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Pelican Products, has brought a motion to compel arbitration of the 11-count lawsuit filed by the plaintiff, Monica Rigali, arising from her employment as an executive with the company. The plaintiff has claimed various forms of misconduct, including hostile work environment, harassment, retaliation, discrimination, and other tort causes of action. While the plaintiff does not recall agreeing to arbitrate suits concerning her employment, the defendant's evidence shows that the plaintiff executed an arbitration agreement during her on-boarding process.

The primary issue is whether the arbitration agreement is enforceable, given the recent passage of the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act (EFAA) in 2021. The EFAA amended the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) to bar forced arbitration of sexual assault and sexual harassment disputes. The plaintiff argues that the allegations in her complaint relate to sexual harassment and therefore are barred from arbitration.

The court notes that some of the allegations in the complaint relate to sexual harassment, while others do not. The court will take oral argument on the issues and consider the cited precedents before issuing a final decision on the motion.
