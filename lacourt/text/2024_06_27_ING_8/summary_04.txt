English-text summary:

Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Court has denied the Defendant's motion to stay proceedings in the case Jane Doe T.B. v. Centinela Valley Union High School District, et al. The motion was filed on May 13, 2024, and argued that the Court should stay proceedings pending the resolution of two pending writs in the Court of Appeal. The writs involve the constitutionality of AB 218, which extends the statute of limitations for childhood sexual abuse claims.

The Court has granted the Plaintiff's request to take judicial notice of certain documents relating to the writs. The Court has also denied the Defendant's request to stay proceedings, citing the potential prejudice to the Plaintiff if the case is delayed.

The Court has noted that the constitutionality of AB 218 is currently pending in the Court of Appeal, and that the Plaintiff's claims are exempt from the government claims act. The Court has also cited the case Coats v. New Haven Unified School Dist. (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 415, which held that the Legislature has the power to revive claims previously barred by a claim presentation requirement.

The Court has denied the motion to stay proceedings, finding that the Defendant has failed to demonstrate a sufficient reason for delaying the case. The case is currently set for trial on August 11, 2025.
