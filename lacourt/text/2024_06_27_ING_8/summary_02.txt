Here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the Motion to Tax Costs filed by the Plaintiffs, Daniel Luna and Irene Sulencka, seeking to tax the costs claimed by the prevailing party, County of Los Angeles. The Court has concluded that the Motion should be denied.

The Court notes that the County filed a memorandum of costs seeking to be awarded $7,052.64 in costs associated with litigation, and that the Plaintiffs have not objected to the entire cost memorandum. The Court also notes that the County has provided detailed invoices and other records in support of its costs, which include service of process costs, witness fees, and other expenses.

The Court finds that the County has satisfied its burden of showing that the service of process costs were reasonable and necessary, and that the production of medical records was adequate. The Court also finds that the Plaintiffs have failed to show that the service of subpoenas was unnecessary or that the production of medical records was inadequate.

Accordingly, the Court denies the Motion to Tax Costs and directs the Clerk to amend the defense judgment to include the $7,052.64 in costs awarded to the County.
