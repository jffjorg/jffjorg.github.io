And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Defendant Sullivan Curtis Monroe Insurance Services, LLC to the third cause of action for professional negligence in a case between Ocean Recovery, LLC and the defendants. The judge notes that the pleadings are vague, nebulous, difficult to understand, and uncertain. The judge will take oral argument on whether the allegations are sufficient to state a cause of action for negligence by a producer or brokerage. The judge will also seek input from the defendant on why the allegations in paragraph 38 of the 5th amended complaint are insufficient to survive a demurrer. The judge will consider whether the allegations meet the standard for professional negligence, which requires that the broker use reasonable care, diligence, and judgment in procuring the insurance policy requested by the insured. The judge will also consider whether the broker's alleged representations to the insured about the nature, extent, or scope of the coverage being offered or provided are sufficient to state a cause of action.
