Summary:

The Judge is issuing a tentative ruling on a motion to set aside default and request sanctions. The case involves a dispute between Omni Manhattan Towers Limited Partnership (Plaintiff) and Matern Law Group, PC and Matthew J. Matern (Defendants) over a defaulted judgment. The Judge notes that there are issues of miscommunication and failure to meet and confer between the parties. The Judge is inclined to grant the motion to set aside default and condition it on the filing of a joint answer by the Defendants within 15 days, but is denying the request for monetary sanctions. The Judge is ordering oral argument from both sides on the issues and is encouraging civility among litigation counsel.
