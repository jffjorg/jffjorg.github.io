TRIAL DATE:                        None set.  
¿¿ 
MOTION:¿                              (1) Plaintiff’s ex parte

                By this
Application to coordinate hearings on an ex parte basis, Plaintiff seeks to re-schedule,
coordinate, and potentially advance a number of pending motions bearing on the
Plaintiff’s deposition.  Defendant filed
an opposition, among other things claiming that proper notice of the ex parte  application had not been given in advance of
an email attaching the moving papers, and claiming that he will be unable to
appear because of a pre-existing mediation on his calendar in another
case.  While the Court is desirous of
coordinating hearings, doing so by ex parte application rather than by
stipulation is a perilous path when there has not been advance meet and confer
to see if agreement could be negotiated that would avoid the need to further
congest the Court’s calendar on a day with 6 noticed motions already on
calendar for the morning and another (in a different courtroom that Judge Fank
is covering) in the afternoon.
                The
Court’s tentative is deny the ex parte application without prejudice.  The Court intends to conduct an IDC on a
range of issues on July 24, including deposition issues, and to reintroduce on
that same date and time the potential for the parties to reach a settlement
that each side nearly concluded with Judge Tanaka.  Thus, the perceived need to schedule
deposition-related motions in September is premature and lacks the urgency
required for ex parte relief.
