And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's ex parte application to schedule motions related to the deposition. The plaintiff had requested to reschedule, coordinate, and potentially advance several pending motions, but the defendant had opposed the application, alleging a lack of notice and a scheduling conflict due to a pre-existing mediation. The court finds that the plaintiff's application was premature and lacked urgency, and that the issues can be addressed through a more formal process, such as an Issues Discussion Conference (IDC) on July 24. The court intends to reintroduce the possibility of settlement on that date, and has denied the ex parte application without prejudice.
