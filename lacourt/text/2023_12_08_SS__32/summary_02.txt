And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion for reconsideration filed by Plaintiff Maria Elenas regarding the Court's monetary sanction order. The Court set an Order to Show Cause (OSC) regarding Plaintiff's counsel's failure to appear at the Final Status Conference (FSC) on August 29, 2023. Despite being served with the OSC, Plaintiff's counsel did not appear and was ordered to pay $250 in monetary sanctions on September 12, 2023. Plaintiff now moves for reconsideration, arguing that counsel had no notice of the OSC and that the parties had agreed to request a trial continuance.

The Court grants Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration, vacating the order for monetary sanctions on September 12, 2023. The Court finds that, although there is a presumption of notice given the proof of service of notice of the OSC, the Court's order was based on a flawed assumption and the Court should have considered Plaintiff's counsel's sworn testimony that counsel did not receive notice of the OSC. The Court admonishes Plaintiff's counsel to be prepared and in compliance with the Court's orders, including the 8th Amended Standing Order for Procedures Governing PI Hub Courts, and to appear in court when ordered.
