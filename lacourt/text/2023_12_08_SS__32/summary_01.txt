And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies plaintiff Maria Teresa Joya's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint in a premises liability and general negligence lawsuit against Matsunaga Enterprise, Inc. The motion was opposed by the defendant. The judge finds that the plaintiff has not met its burden to establish that the amendment is proper, as the parties' motions in limine will be heard by the trial court and an amendment may become necessary and proper to conform to the proof actually permitted at trial. The judge notes that the plaintiff's position could result in a jury verdict inconsistent with the court's ruling on summary adjudication.
