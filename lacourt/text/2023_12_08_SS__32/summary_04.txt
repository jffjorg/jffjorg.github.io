And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment filed by the Defendant City of Alhambra. The Plaintiff Liling Zhong alleges premises liability, general negligence, and dangerous condition of public property after tripping and falling on uneven ground. The Defendant argues that there is no triable issue of material fact and seeks summary judgment. The Judge finds that the Defendant has failed to meet its burden on summary judgment, as it did not provide facts to show that a public employee did not create the alleged dangerous condition. Therefore, the motion for summary judgment is denied.
