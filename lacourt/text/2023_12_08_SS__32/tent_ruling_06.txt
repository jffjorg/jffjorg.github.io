[1]
Plaintiff argues that Defendant “has not taken a single deposition in this
case.” (Motion at p. 11.) It is unclear whose deposition Plaintiff believes
would be a less intrusive alternative, but a deposition of Plaintiff or Plaintiff’s
medical providers without the records would neither be less intrusive nor
satisfy the need for the information contained in the records in order to
properly cross-examine.


[2]
Plaintiff simply argues that “a protective order be imposed so that private
information, though maybe discoverable to some degree, does not become part of
the public domain by being attached to papers filed with the Court.” (Motion at
p. 11.) The parties should meet and confer and submit a proposed protective
order. The Court suggests that the parties refer to the Court’s form protective
order. At the hearing on this motion, Defendant may respond to Plaintiff’s
assertion that inside legal counsel should be prohibited from viewing the
records. (Reply at p. 5.)
