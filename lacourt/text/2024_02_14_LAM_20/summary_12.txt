And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Defendants Ronald Massman and DHX–Dependable Hawaiian Express, Inc. (“DHX”) to the Second, Third, and Fourth Causes of Action in the First Amended Complaint filed by Plaintiff Bradley J. Dechter. The Plaintiff alleges that he is entitled to an interest in DHX due to his contributions, but that his ownership interest has been refused. The demurrer is overruled, and the request for judicial notice is granted. The motion to strike the FAC’s alter ego allegations is denied.

The Judge finds that the statute of limitations is a factual issue in this case and that the Plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded delayed discovery of his rights. The Court also finds that the Plaintiff has pleaded an entitlement to disgorgement, particularly as fraud has also been pleaded.

The Judge rejects the Defendants’ arguments that the Second Cause of Action for breach of a 1991 oral contract is barred by the two-year statute of limitations and that the Third Cause of Action for fraud is barred by the economic loss rule. The Judge also rejects the Defendants’ arguments that the unjust enrichment claim fails because the Plaintiff has not been paid what he is owed.

The Judge orders that an answer be filed within 20 days.
