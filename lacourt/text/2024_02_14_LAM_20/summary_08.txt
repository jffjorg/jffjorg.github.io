And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is considering a tentative ruling on a motion filed by East West Bank (EWB) to be discharged of liability with respect to $569,433.81 in disputed funds. The funds were held by EWB and the defendants, Gerry Hong, DB Shipping (USA) Inc., and Ren Chang Wang, have made conflicting claims to the funds. The Court finds that EWB properly initiated the interpleader action and deposited the funds with the Court, avoiding the risk of inconsistent results in the event each claimant were to initiate a separate legal action. The Court will discharge EWB of liability and determine the claimants' respective rights to the funds. The Court also awards a total of $10,000 in fees and costs to EWB, finding that the hours expended for the interpleader action are excessive. The motion is granted in part as set forth herein.
