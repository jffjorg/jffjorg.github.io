And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling in this employment action, where plaintiff Victoria White is seeking to compel initial responses to her interrogatories propounded on defendants Service All-Stars Energy, Inc. and Faisal Lodhi. The defendants contend that they were surprised by the motion because the parties had agreed to engage in settlement discussions and pause discovery, and that the plaintiff's counsel failed to initiate these discussions. However, the judge finds that there was an agreement to pause discovery and engage in settlement discussions, and that the plaintiff's counsel failed to follow up on this agreement. As a result, the judge will compel the defendants to respond to the interrogatories within 30 days, but will not award sanctions. The defendants can still assert objections to the interrogatories.
