And here is the English text summary:

The tentative ruling grants Defendant Donald Turner's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against Plaintiff Hector Serna. The case stems from a real estate transaction in which the Defendant sold a property to the Plaintiff for $325,000. The Plaintiff agreed to give the Defendant time to clean up the property, but the Defendant later demanded an increase in the purchase price. The Plaintiff found a buyer for the property who agreed to pay $430,000, prompting the Defendant to refuse to complete the sale. The Defendant seeks to file a cross-complaint alleging fraud, financial elder abuse, slander of title, conversion, and forcible detainer. The Court grants the motion, citing the liberal construction of Code of Civil Procedure section 426.50, which allows a party to file a cross-complaint unless the moving party acts in bad faith.
