And here is the English summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Ramiro S. Lopez v. Sandra Garcia, denying Lopez's motion to determine the fair market value of the Pomona property and send a buyout notice. The court rules that Lopez has failed to provide a copy of the appraisal for the court and opposing counsel's review and has failed to establish why a court-ordered appraisal would be cost-prohibitive. The court cites Code of Civil Procedure section 874.316, which requires the court to determine the fair market value of the property by ordering an appraisal. The court notes that Lopez's claim that the evidentiary value of the appraisal outweighs the cost of the appraisal is reversed.
