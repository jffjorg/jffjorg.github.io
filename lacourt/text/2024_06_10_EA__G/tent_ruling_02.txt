 Case Number:  23PSCV03546    Hearing Date:   June 10, 2024    Dept:  G Defendant Donald Turner’s Motion for Leave to File Cross-Complaint Respondent: NO OPPOSITION TENTATIVE RULING Defendant Donald Turner’s Motion for Leave to File  Cross-Complaint is GRANTED. Defendant Donald Turner is ordered to file separately  the Cross-Complaint submitted with the declaration of attorney John F. Mansour,  Esq. BACKGROUND This  is a breach of contract action arising from a real estate transaction. In  August 2020, Plaintiff Hector Serna offered to purchase a property in La Puente  from Defendant Donald Turner for $325,000. In October 2020, Turner offered to accept  $100,000 in cash for the La Puente property. Serna then accepted Turner’s offer  and agreed to give Turner time to clean up the La Puente property which was  allegedly dilapidated and uninhabitable. In December 2021, Turner allegedly requested  the purchase price be increased to $200,000 and Serna agreed. In June 2023, Turner  gave Serna the keys for the La Puente property and surrendered possession to  Serna. In July 2023, Serna found a buyer for the La Puente property who agreed  to pay $430,000. When Turner learned Serna was going to flip the La Puente  property, Turner demanded Serna pay $430,000 and refused to complete their  sales transaction. On November 16, 2023, Serna filed a complaint  against Turner alleging breach of contract. On  February 20, 2024, Serna filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) against Turner  and Does 1-20, alleging the following causes of action: (1) breach of oral  contract, (2) specific performance, and (3) declaratory relief. On May  3, 2024, Turner filed the present motion. A hearing on Turner’s motion and a  case management conference are set for June 10, 2024. ANALYSIS Turner  seeks leave to file a cross-complaint against Serna and Does 1-20 that alleges (1)  fraud, (2) financial elder abuse, (3) slander of title, (4) conversion, and (5)  forcible detainer. For the following reasons, the Court GRANTS Turner’s  motion. Legal  Standard Pursuant  to Code of Civil Procedure section 428.50, subdivision (a), a party is entitled  to “file a cross-complaint against any of the parties who filed the complaint  or cross-complaint against him or her before or at the same time as the answer  to the complaint or cross-complaint.” Furthermore, “[a]ny other cross-complaint  may be filed at any time before the court has set a date for trial.” (Code Civ.  Proc., § 428.50, subd. (b).) If a cross-compliant is not filed within these  guidelines, it may only be filed with leave of the court, who may grant it “in  the interest of justice at any time during the course of the action.” (Code  Civ. Proc., § 428.50, subd. (c).) A  cross-complaint is compulsory when a related cause of action existed at the  time of serving the defendant’s answer to the complaint. (Code Civ. Proc., §  426.30, subd. (a); see also Crocker Nat. Bank v. Emerald (1990)  221 Cal.App.3d 852, 864.) A “‘[r]elated cause of action’ means a cause of  action which arises out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of  transactions or occurrences as the cause of action which the plaintiff alleges  in his complaint.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 426.10, subd. (c).) Leave must be  granted to file a compulsory cross-complaint when the defendant is acting in  good faith. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 426.50.) “[W]hat  constitutes ‘good faith’—or lack of it—under Code of Civil Procedure Section  426.50 must be determined in light of and in conformity with the liberality  conferred upon the trial courts by the section and by prior law. … [T]his  principle of liberality requires that a strong showing of bad faith be made in  order to support a denial of the right to file a cross-complaint under this  section.” (Foot’s Transfer & Storage Co. v. Superior Court (1980)  114 Cal.App.3d 897, 902.) A determination of bad faith may be premised on  “substantial injustice or prejudice” to the opposing party. (Id., at  p. 903; see also Gherman v. Colburn (1977) 72 Cal.App.3d 544, 560, fn. 9  [stating leave was properly denied where defendant’s motion “was merely a  tactical strategic maneuver to deprive plaintiffs of a right to a jury  trial”].) Discussion In this case,  Turner’s counsel states Turner was unable to file a cross-complaint with Turner’s  answer on April 5, 2024, as it was not yet ready for filing. (Mansour Decl., ¶  2-3.) The Court notes Turner only took one additional month to file the present  motion and that trial has not yet been set in the present action. The Court is  also not in receipt of any timely opposition from Serna. Because Code of Civil Procedure section  426.50 is liberally construed in favor of granting a motion to file a  cross-complaint and such a motion should be granted unless the moving party  acts in bad faith, the Court discerns no bad faith on Turner’s part and GRANTS Turner’s motion. CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, Turner’s motion for leave  to file a cross-complaint is GRANTED. Defendant  Donald Turner is ordered to file separately the Cross-Complaint submitted with  the declaration of attorney John F. Mansour, Esq.
