  Case Number:  23PSCV01693    Hearing Date:   June 10, 2024    Dept:  G Plaintiff Ramiro S. Lopez’s Motion to Determine Value
and Send Buyout Notice
Respondent: Defendant Sandra
Garcia
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Ramiro S. Lopez’s Motion to Determine Value
and Send Buyout Notice is DENIED.
BACKGROUND
This
is a partition action involving real property in Pomona. In April 1994, Maria
Luisa Sandoval and Plaintiff Ramiro S. Lopez acquired the Pomona property
through a grant deed as tenants-in-common. In February 2022, Sandoval and Lopez
mortgaged the Pomona property through Defendant Travelers Bank & Trust
(Travelers). In May 2004, Sandoval and Lopez also mortgaged the Pomona property
through Defendant Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS). After
Sandoval passed away in October 2022, the relationship between Lopez and
Defendant Sandra Garcia, the successor trustee of the Maria Luisa Sandoval
Trust (Sandoval Trust), allegedly deteriorated.
On
June 6, 2023, Lopez filed a complaint against Garcia, MERS, Travelers, and Does
1-10, alleging a cause of action for partition. On October 16, 2023, the Court granted Garcia’s
motion to strike portions of Lopez’s Complaint.
On October
18, 2023, Lopez filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) against the same
defendants alleging the same cause of action.
On March 19, 2024, Lopez filed
the present motion. A hearing on the present motion is set for June 10, 2024,
with a mandatory settlement conference on July 18, 2024, and a post-mediation
status conference/trial setting conference on August 8, 2024.
ANALYSIS
Lopez
moves for the Court to determine the fair market value of the Pomona property
and send a buyout notice pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 874.316.
For the following reasons, the Court DENIES Lopez’s motion.
In
partition actions brought pursuant to the Partition of Real Property Act, the
Court determines the “fair market value of the property by ordering an
appraisal.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 874.316.) But “[i]f the court determines that
the evidentiary value of an appraisal is outweighed by the cost of the
appraisal, the court, after an evidentiary hearing, shall determine the fair
market value of the property and send notice to the parties of the value.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 874.316, subd. (c).)
In
this case, while Lopez moves the Court to adopt a $600,000 valuation of the
property, Lopez has failed to include a copy of the appraisal for the Court and
opposing counsel’s review. (Motion, p. 7:19-22; Sikavi Decl., ¶ 12, Ex. 6.) Furthermore,
Lopez fails to establish how the evidentiary value of a court-ordered appraisal
would be outweighed by the cost of the appraisal. Instead, Lopez reversed the
statutory standard by claiming the evidentiary value of Lopez’s appraisal
outweighs the cost of appraisal, (Motion, p. 7:7-8.)
Accordingly,
because Lopez fails to provide a copy of the appraisal referenced and establish
why a court-ordered appraisal is cost-prohibitive, Lopez’s motion is DENIED.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, the
Court DENIES Lopez’s motion to determine value and send buyout notice.
