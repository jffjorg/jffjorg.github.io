And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants summary adjudication in favor of the Plaintiff, WILLIAM P. HOWELL, as Trustee of the Howell Family Trust, on the issue of duty. The case arises from property damage allegedly caused by a utility company and its contractors. The Plaintiff claims that the defendants, SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON, EDISON POWER CONSTRUCTORS, INC., TIDWELL EXCAVATION ACQUISITION CO., and HAMPTON-TEDDER ELECTRIC COMPANY, owed a duty of care to the Plaintiff because it was foreseeable that the installation of a pole into a drainage pipe and clogging it with foam and gravel would impair the function of the drainage system and cause soil erosion and mudslides during a heavy storm.

The Court concludes that the installation of the pole and clogging the pipe with foam and gravel is a foreseeable event for purposes of an analysis of duty. The Court also finds that the category of negligent conduct at issue is sufficiently likely to result in the kind of harm experienced. The Court grants summary adjudication in favor of the Plaintiff on the issue of duty, despite the opposition from Hampton-Tedder, which argues that there are disputed issues as to breach of duty and causation.
