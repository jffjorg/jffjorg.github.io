 Case Number:  23VECV01421    Hearing Date:   August 15, 2024    Dept:  T 23VECV01421
Zomorodinia v Hansotia
Tentative
ruling:  Ex parte application to continue
trial and reopen discovery.
The court is inclined to grant the motion as it
appears that in response to Form Interrogatory 11.2, plaintiff failed to
disclose 2 workers’ compensation claims for prior injuries sustained on July
19, 2013, and April 29, 2016 including a claim for back injuries and this
information was obtained – not from the plaintiff – but from subpoenaed
documents from a third party and only close to the discovery cutoff.  If the court grants this motion, it will allow
only defendant to conduct additional discovery as to these two claims but not
plaintiff, and it would allow defendant to serve an amended expert designation.  The court will set a timeline for these
matters.  Otherwise, discovery cutoff for
plaintiff is as previously scheduled.  The
court will determine as to additional discovery as to Mobin Medical Group at
the hearing on 8/26/2024.  The parties
may stipulate for additional discovery beyond what the court will grant.  Finally, the court had previously ordered no
further continuances.  However, that
was before the court was made aware that plaintiff failed to disclose prior injuries
in discovery responses
