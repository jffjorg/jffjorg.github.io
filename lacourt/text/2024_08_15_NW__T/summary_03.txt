```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is inclined to grant the defendant's motion to continue the trial and reopen discovery. This is because the plaintiff failed to disclose two workers' compensation claims for prior injuries sustained in 2013 and 2016. The defendant obtained this information from subpoenaed documents from a third party, not from the plaintiff. The judge will allow the defendant to conduct additional discovery as to these two claims, but not the plaintiff. The defendant will also be able to serve an amended expert designation. The judge will set a timeline for these matters. The court will determine whether additional discovery is necessary regarding Mobin Medical Group at a hearing on August 26, 2024. The parties may stipulate for additional discovery beyond what the court grants.
