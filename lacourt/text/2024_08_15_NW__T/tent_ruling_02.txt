 Case Number:  20STCV27421    Hearing Date:   August 15, 2024    Dept:  T KREBS V FELSEN 20STCV27421
THE MOTION TO CONTINUE IS DENIED.
On 12/16/2021, the trial was continued.
On 12/5/2022, the trial was continued.
The parties failed to appear for FSC on 9/14/2023.
On 9/27/2023, the trial was continued again.
On 3/13/2024, the parties “wanted to go to Resolve” and
were Ordered to Resolve Law 3/14/2024.  Trial was continued to
10/17/2024.
Now there is a Stipulation to continue trial to April 2025
(the parties "want to go to Resolve")
The case is 4 years old.  It is simple dog bite
case. THE DOG BITE OCCURRED 6 YEARS AGO. There is no evidence that the
parties registered for Resolve Law and scheduled a hearing date despite being
referred 4 months ago.
Also, the court notes the absence of a declaration from
defense counsel with more specific information about when he is having surgery
and for how long after surgery the doctor would recommend against appearing at
trial and why.
The court will not continue the trial to allow the parties
to go to Resolve Law; the court already continued earlier for that reason. If
the trial is continued for a short time to accommodate medical needs, discovery
will not be extended.
