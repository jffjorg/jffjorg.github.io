And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to continue the trial, which would allow the parties to resolve their case through an alternative dispute resolution process. The case has been ongoing for four years, and the dog bite that is the subject of the lawsuit occurred six years ago. Despite being referred to the Resolve Law process four months ago, there is no evidence that the parties have registered for it or scheduled a hearing date. The judge notes that the parties have already had several continuances of the trial, including one due to their failure to appear for a mandatory settlement conference. The judge is willing to accommodate a short continuance to allow the defense counsel to recover from surgery, but any such continuance would not extend the discovery period.
