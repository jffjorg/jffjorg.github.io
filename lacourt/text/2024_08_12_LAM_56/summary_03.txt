Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied the Motion for Protective Order Restricting Discovery and to Limit the Extent and Use of Discovery Method filed by the Defendants. The Defendants contended that under Welfare and Institutions Code section 5328, all information and records obtained in the course of providing services to either voluntary or involuntary recipients shall be confidential. However, the Court held that even if the records sought to be discovered are confidential, there are exceptions to allow their discovery pursuant to a valid subpoena, and procedures are in place to protect the confidentiality of the information. The Court also took notice of the Regional Center of Orange County's Guidelines for Access to Vendor Records, which classifies "documents which contain confidential consumer information" as confidential, and states that "confidential records shall be produced pursuant to a valid subpoena, with identifying consumer information redacted."
