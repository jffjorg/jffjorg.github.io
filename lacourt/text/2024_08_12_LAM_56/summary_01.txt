And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings in its entirety. The plaintiff's complaints of wrongful death, general negligence, professional negligence, elder abuse, and violation of the Eighth Amendment are dismissed for failure to state a cause of action. The plaintiff is granted 30 days to amend the complaint to establish standing to bring the causes of action and to sufficiently state the causes of action, except as to the fifth cause of action. The motion to strike is deemed moot since the motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted.
