MOVING PARTY: Defendant
Beverly Hills Rehabilitation Centre, LLC (named as “Beverly Hills
Rehabilitation Centre, LLC” and “Rehab Centre of Beverly Hills”) (“BHRC”) 
 
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff
Markella Thanou (“Plaintiff”)
 
            The Court has considered the moving,
opposition and reply papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
             This
case stems from a complaint ("Complaint") filed by Plaintiff against
Defendants BHRC and Roger T. Wang, MD on September 14, 2022.  The Complaint asserts causes of action for
(1) general negligence; (2) professional negligence; (3) wrongful death; (4)
elder abuse; and (5) violation of the Eighth Amendment. 
 
            On April 26, 2024, BHRC filed a
Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings (the “Motion for Judgment”) as to the
causes of action in the Complaint for general negligence, professional negligence,
wrongful death, elder abuse and violation of the Eighth Amendment.  On the same day, BHRC filed a Motion to
Strike certain portions of the Complaint. 

 
Plaintiff
filed an opposition to the Motion for Judgment on August 5, 2024, and BHRC
filed a reply on August 6, 2024.  No
opposition to the Motion to Strike has been filed.
 
MEET AND CONFER 
             BHRC has complied with the statutory
obligation to meet and confer.  
 
DISCUSSION
Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings
Legal Standard 
            A defendant may
move for judgment on the pleadings where the court has no jurisdiction of the
subject of the cause of action alleged in the complaint or the complaint does
not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against that
defendant. (Code Civ. Proc., § 438(c)(1)(B).)¿¿¿ 
 
A motion for judgment on the pleadings is analogous
to a general demurrer. (Lance Camper Mfg. Corp. v. Republic Indemnity Co. of
Am. (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 194, 198.) 
Like demurrers, motions for judgment on the pleadings challenge the
legal sufficiency of the allegations, not their veracity.  (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)¿¿ 
¿ 
All facts alleged in the complaint are deemed
admitted, and the complaint is given a reasonable interpretation as a whole and
all parts in their context.  (Lance,
44 Cal.App.4th at 198.)  The court does
not, however, do so for “conclusions of law or fact, opinions, speculation, or
allegations contrary to law or [judicially noticed] facts…”  (Stevenson Real Estate Servs., Inc. v. CB
Richard Ellis Real Estate Servs., Inc. (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 1215,
1219-20.)¿ 
¿ 
Any defects must either appear on the face of the
pleading, or else be taken by judicial notice. 
(Bezirdjian v. O'Reilly (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 316, 321-22.)  A motion for judgment on the pleadings may be
granted when, “under the state of the pleadings, together with matters that may
be judicially noticed, it appears that a party is entitled to judgment as a
matter of law.” (Southern California Edison Co. v. City of Victorville
(2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 218, 227.)¿ 
 
Timing 
            A motion for
judgment on the pleadings may be brought by a defendant at any time after the
time to demur has expired and an answer has been filed.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 438(f)).  Unless a court orders otherwise, a motion for
judgment on the pleadings may not be made after entry of a pre-trial conference
order, (Cal. Rules of Court 3.720-3.730) or 30 days before the initial trial
date, whichever is later.  (Code Civ.
Proc. § 438(e).  This case has not yet
been set for trial, and no pre-trial conference order was entered in this
case.  The Motion for Judgment is,
therefore, timely.  
 
Plaintiff filed an untimely opposition to the Motion
for Judgment.  Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure, section 1005, subsection (b), a timely opposition was due nine court
days before the hearing date of August 12, 2024; that is, on or before July 30,
2024.  Plaintiff did not serve an
opposition until August 5, 2024, which is six days after the expiration of the
statutory deadline to file a timely opposition. 
Nevertheless, the court has the discretion to consider late or defective
papers in favor of the strong policy favoring the disposition of the case on
the merits.  (Kapitanski v. Von’s (1983)
146 Cal.App.3d 29, 32.)  BHRC has not
demonstrated that it has suffered prejudice from the late filing of the
opposition.  In any event, the Court has also
considered BHRC’s reply brief.
 
Motion
In BHRC’s Motion for Judgment, BHRC argues that the
Complaint is devoid of any facts or allegations related to Plaintiff’s
relationship with the decedent, Demetrios Fotinatos (“Decedent”).  BHRC thus contends that Plaintiff lacks
standing to bring this action.  
 
Additionally, BHRC contends that the Complaint fails
to state facts sufficient to constitute a claim for general negligence,
professional negligence, wrongful death, elder abuse and violation of the
Eighth Amendment.  
 
Opposition
In opposition, Plaintiff asserts that she is the
surviving spouse of the Decedent, and submits a declaration stating that she is
“the spouse of the deceased Mr. Demetrios Fotinatos”, attaching therewith a
copy of a License and Certificate of Marriage. 
(Declaration of Markella Thanou, ¶ 3; Exh. 1.)  Plaintiff thus contends that she has
satisfied the standing requirement.  
 
Moreover, Plaintiff contends that the Complaint
sufficiently states causes of action for wrongful death, general negligence and
professional negligence.  Plaintiff asserts
that the Complaint alleged that the Decedent was admitted to BHRC’s facility,
that BHRC owed the Decedent a legal duty to use due care, that BHRC breached
that duty by failing to take reasonable care in the feeding of the deceased,
and that the breach was a proximate or legal cause of the resulting injury and
death of the Decedent.
 
Reply
In reply, BHRC argues that Plaintiff’s declaration
falls short of establishing standing as she merely asserted, “I am the spouse of
deceased…”  The declaration, however,
fails to assert under penalty of perjury that she also remained married to the Decedent
at the time of his death.  Thus, the declaration
does not establish standing to bring a wrongful death cause of action, as it is
unclear whether the marriage was dissolved prior to the Decedent’s passing.  
 
BHRC further asserts that Plaintiff lacks standing
to bring the causes of action for general negligence and professional
negligence as she has failed to comply with the specific requirements of Code
of Civil Procedure, section 377.32, in order to proceed as the Decedent’s successor
in interest.  That is, she has not filed
an affidavit or declaration demonstrating that she is Decedent’s successor in
interest and that no other person has a superior right to commence this
proceeding.
 
BHRC also points out that Plaintiff did not oppose
or address BHRC’s arguments regarding the failure to state causes of action for
elder abuse and violation of the Eighth Amendment, and asserts that Plaintiff
thus concedes to the merit of BHRC’s arguments. 
 
1st Cause of Action: Wrongful Death
The elements of a wrongful death action are a tort
(negligence or other wrongful act), resulting death (causation), and loss
(damages) suffered by the heirs.  When
the tort is negligence, plaintiff must, of course, prove defendant's duty and
breach thereof.  (Lattimore v. Dickey (2015)
239 Cal.App.4th 959, 968; Jacoves v. United Merchandising Corp. (1992) 9
Cal.App.4th 88, 105, 11.)
 
Only those persons expressly set forth in Code of Civil
Procedure (“CCP) § 377.60 have standing to maintain a wrongful death action.  (Ceja v. Rudolph & Sletten, Inc. (2013)
56 Cal.4th 1113, 1118; Holguin v. Flores (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 428,
437-438.)  CCP § 377.60 limits the persons
who may assert a wrongful death claim to: the victim decedent's surviving
spouse, domestic partner, children and issue of deceased children; or, if there
is no surviving issue, the persons, including the surviving spouse or domestic
partner, who would be entitled to succeed to the estate if the victim had died
intestate.  (Prob. Code, § 6400, et seq.)  To qualify as a "surviving spouse"
in a wrongful death action, Plaintiff must establish that they were married to
the decedent at the time of the decedent's death.  (Prob. Code, § 78.)
 
Here, while Plaintiff indicated under Section 12 of
the Complaint that “Plaintiff is the wife of the deceased, Demetrios
Fontinatos”, nowhere is it specifically alleged that Plaintiff was a “surviving
spouse”, that is, that she was married to Decedent at the time of death.  The category of persons eligible to bring
wrongful death actions is strictly construed. (Soto v. BorgWarner Morse TEC
Inc. (2015) 239 Cal. App. 4th 165, 188.) 
A former spouse is not an heir and thus has no standing to bring a
wrongful death action.  (Villacampa v.
Russel (1986) 178 Cal. App. 3d 906, 908-909.)  A plaintiff must plead and prove his or her
status as a proper statutory wrongful death claimant. (Nelson v. County of
Los Angeles (2003) 113 Cal. App. 4th 783, 789.)  
 
Plaintiff attempts to cure the defect in her
Complaint by submitting a declaration in her opposition stating that she is the
spouse of the Decedent and attaching a copy of the Certificate of
Marriage.  In ruling on a motion for
judgment on the pleadings, a judge is confined to the facts alleged in the
challenged pleading.  Presenting
extrinsic evidence is not proper.  (Gerawan
Farming, Inc. v Lyons (2000) 24 Cal.4th 468, 515–516; Sykora v State
Dep't of State Hosps. (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 1530, 1534.)  In any case, as in the Complaint, Plaintiff’s
declaration is also insufficient to establish standing as a “surviving spouse” since
it does not set forth that she remained married to the Decedent at the time of
his death, and it is unclear whether or not her marriage with the Decedent was
dissolved prior to the Decedent’s passing. 
 
Moreover, the Complaint does not sufficiently state
facts to establish BHRC’s duty of care. 
While Plaintiff, in her opposition, asserts that the Decedent was
admitted to BHRC’s facility, and that BHRC thus owed a duty of care, the
Complaint does not sufficiently set forth those allegations.  Rather, in a conclusory fashion, the
Complaint merely states that “Defendants, and DOES 1 to 20 were negligent in
the diagnosis, care and treatment of Mr. Demetrios Fotinatos”, but without
stating facts to support that BHRC had a duty of care in the first place.
 
Additionally, the facts are wanting as to
allegations to support damages suffered by Plaintiff as a result of Decedent’s
death. 
 
Accordingly, the Court finds that as alleged, Plaintiff
fails to state facts sufficient to constitute wrongful death and fails to
establish standing to bring a wrongful death cause of action.  
 
2nd and 3rd Causes of Action:
General Negligence and Professional Negligence
Foremost, a “survival action” is distinct from a
wrongful death action. A wrongful death action is an independent claim on
behalf of the decedent's heirs for damages they personally suffered on account
of the death (CCP § 377.60 et seq.); a survival action (e.g. personal injury
action), on the other hand, “survives” to decedent's estate for the purpose of
recovering damages that would have been awardable personally to decedent had he
or she lived (CCP § 377.20 et seq.)  Unlike
a cause of action for wrongful death, “a survivor cause of action is not a new
cause of action that vests in the heirs on the death of the decedent.  It is instead a separate and distinct cause of
action which belonged to the decedent before death but, by statute, survives
that event.  (Grant v. McAuliffe
(1953) 41 Cal.2d 859, 864.)
 
If a person dies having a cause of action for
injuries suffered during life, the claim “survives” to their estate under CCP §
377.20 and may be prosecuted by a duly appointed executor, administrator, or
guardian on behalf of the estate.  (CCP
§§ 377.20, 377.30; Adams v. Sup.Ct. (Centinella Freeman Regional Med. Ctr.)
(2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 71, 78-79.)  If
there is no personal representative for the estate (e.g., estate not probated
or probate completed), the “survival” action may be prosecuted by the
decedent's “successor in interest”—i.e., the person(s) who succeeds, by will or
intestacy, to the cause of action or to the particular item of property that is
the subject of the action. (CCP §§ 377.10, 377.11, 377.30, 377.31; Olson v.
Toy (1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 818, 821.)
 
An action that survives the death of a person passes
to the decedent’s successor-in-interest; and an action may be commenced by the
decedent’s personal representative, or, if none, by the decedent’s
successor-in-interest. (Code Civ. Proc., § 377.30.)  
 
Here, the Complaint, broadly construed, appears to attempt
to allege a survival action of negligence on behalf of Decedent in that
Plaintiff alleges that Decedent’s injuries and death were proximately caused by
the negligence of BHRC.  Therefore,
Plaintiff must make a motion pursuant to CCP section 377.30 and comply with the
requirements of CCP section 377.32 in order to obtain an order to act as the Decedent’s
personal representative, and more clearly state a survival cause of action on
behalf of the Decedent. 
 
Going into the elements of the causes of action, the
elements of general negligence are: (1) legal duty owed to plaintiffs to use
due care;  (2) breach of duty; (3) causation;  and (4) damge.  (County of Santa Clara v. Atlantic
Richfield Co. (2006) 137 Cal. App. 4th 292, 318; (Ladd v. County of San
Mateo (1996) 12 Cal.4th 913, 917.)  The
elements of professional negligence, on the other hand, are: (1) duty of care
owed plaintiff to use skill, prudence and diligence as other members of
profession commonly possess and exercise; (2) breach; (3) causation;  and (4) damage.  (Burgess v. Superior Court (1992) 2
Cal. 4th 1064, 1077; County of Santa Clara v. Atlantic Richfield Co.
(2006) 137 Cal. App. 4th 292, 318; Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th
740, 746-47; Powell v. Kleinman (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 112, 122.  
 
As discussed above under the wrongful death cause of
action, the Complaint does not sufficiently state facts to establish BHRC’s
duty of care.
 
Accordingly, the Court finds that the Complaint
similarly fails to sufficiently state a cause of action for negligence, and Plaintiff
fails to establish standing to bring the cause of action on behalf of the
Decedent.
 
            4th
Cause of Action: Elder Abuse
The elements of elder abuse are: (1) defendant had
responsibility for meeting the basic needs of the elder or dependent adult,
such as nutrition, hydration, hygiene or medical care; (2) defendant  knew of conditions that made the elder or
dependent adult unable to provide for his or her own basic needs; (3) defendant
denied or withheld goods or services necessary to meet the elder or dependent
adult's basic needs; and (4) the neglect caused the elder or dependent adult to
suffer physical harm, pain or mental suffering. 
(Carter v. Prime Healthcare Paradise Valley LLC (2011) 198
Cal.App.4th 396, 407 (“the facts constituting the neglect and establishing the
causal link between the neglect and the injury ‘must be pleaded with particularity,’ in accordance with the pleading rules
governing statutory claims.”)  Here, Plaintiff
has similarly failed to adequately plead the underlying conduct required to
state a claim for elder abuse, or facts sufficient to demonstrate that BHRC abused
or neglected Decedent, nor does the Complaint set forth in the first place that
BHRC had the responsibility to meet the basic needs of the Decedent as an elder
or dependent adult.
 
Moreover,
Welfare and Institutions Code section 15657.3, subdivision (d), delineates who
has standing to bring an elder abuse lawsuit after the death of
an elder or dependent adult. Welfare and Institutions Code section 15657.3,
subdivision (d) states: “Upon petition, after the death of the elder or
dependent adult, the right to maintain an action shall be transferred to the
personal representative of the decedent, or if none, to the person or persons
entitled to succeed to the decedent’s estate.” 
Plaintiff thus fails to comport with the statutory requirements to
support a standing to bring a cause of action for elder abuse. 
 
Accordingly,
the Court finds that Plaintiff fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action for elder abuse, and similarly fails to establish standing to
bring the cause of action.
 
5th Cause of Action: Violation of the
Eighth Amendment
The Eighth Amendment prohibits certain types of punishment:
excessive bail, excessive fines, and cruel and unusual punishments.  (Austin v. United States, 509 U.S. 602, 609 (1993) [The purpose of the Eighth Amendment, putting the Bail Clause to
one side, was to limit the government’s power to punish.”]; Timbs v.
Indiana, No. 17-1091, slip op. at 2 (U.S. Feb.
20, 2019) [“Like the Eighth Amendment’s proscriptions of ‘cruel
and unusual punishment’ and '[e]xcessive bail,’ the protection against
excessive fines guards against abuses of government’s punitive or
criminal-law-enforcement authority.”]  These
prohibitions were intended to protect persons convicted of crimes from
government abuses of power.   (Ingraham
v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 666 (1977); Weems v. United States
(1910) 217 U.S. 349, 372–73.)
 
Clearly, the Eighth Amendment does not apply to the
Plaintiff's claims, as there is no government involvement in this civil action.
 
In sum, the Motion for Judgment is GRANTED in its
entirety for failure to state a cause of action.
 
Leave to Amend
Leave to amend should be
given if there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured.  When a plaintiff “has pleaded the general set
of facts upon which his cause of action is based,” the court should give the
plaintiff an opportunity to amend his complaint, since plaintiff should not “be
deprived of his right to maintain his action on the ground that his pleadings
were defective for lack of particulars.” (Reed v. Norman (1957) 152
Cal.App.2d 892, 900.) Accordingly, California law imposes the burden on the
plaintiffs to demonstrate the manner in which they can amend their pleadings to
state their claims against a defendant.¿¿(Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18
Cal.3d 335, 349.) “Denial of leave to amend constitutes an abuse of discretion
unless the complaint shows on its face it is incapable of amendment.¿
[Citation.]¿ Liberality in permitting amendment is the rule, if a fair
opportunity to correct any defect has not been given."  (Angie M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37
Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227.)
 
Based on the allegations
in the Complaint, read as a whole, there is a reasonable possibility that
Plaintiff can state the first through the fourth causes of action, but not the
fifth cause of action for violation of the Eighth Amendment.  The Court will, therefore, grant leave to
amend the Complaint so as to give Plaintiff an opportunity to establish her standing
to bring the causes of action and to sufficiently state her causes of action,
except as to the fifth cause of action.  Additionally, if Plaintiff
desires to bring survival causes of action as described above, Plaintiff must
comply with the necessary statutory requirements to do so.
 
Motion to Strike
Generally, a motion to strike all or a portion of a
pleading must be filed within the time allowed to respond to that pleading.  (CCP § 435(b)(1); Cal Rules of Ct 3.1322(b); City
& County of San Francisco v Strahlendorf (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1911,
1913.)  Therefore, a motion to strike a
complaint or cross-complaint must generally be filed within 30 days after
service of the complaint or cross-complaint.  (CCP §§ 412.20(a)(3), 432.10).  A defendant may not file a motion to strike
after filing an answer. A judge has the discretion, however, to consider the
merits of the motion under the judge's authority to strike improper matter from
pleadings at any time.  (CCP §
436(a);  CPF Agency Corp. v R&S
Towing Serv. (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 1014, 1020–1021.)  
 
In any event, the Court incorporates the foregoing
discussion and analysis of the Court as to the Motion for Judgment.  Since the Court has GRANTED the Motion for
Judgement in its entirety, the Motion to Strike is MOOT.
                        
RULING
Based on all the foregoing, the court GRANTS
Defendants’ Motion for Judgment in its entirety, with 30 days leave to
amend.  The Motion to Strike is MOOT.
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
