MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff
Ronda Jones (“Plaintiff”)
 
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendants
B & B Stables; Robert D. Buell; and Mary D. Buell (collectively,
“Defendants”)
 
            The Court has considered the moving,
opposition, and reply papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
             On September 6, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint
(“Complaint”) against Defendants for (1) Violation of Civil Rights - Unruh Act,
Civil Code § 51; (2) Violation of the California Business and Professions Code
- §17200, et seq.; and (3) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.  Plaintiff’s matter arises out of a
business/patron relationship wherein Plaintiff was allegedly treated
differently based on her race, and was evicted from a stable despite tendering
full monthly payment of her stable rent at all times during her tenancy.  
 
            On February 1, 2024, the Court
dismissed Plaintiff’s Complaint without prejudice, for Plaintiff’s failure to
submit a request for entry of default.  (2/1/24 Minute Order.)  Plaintiff filed a Motion to Set Aside/Vacate
Dismissal on February 26, 2024, which the Court granted on June 10, 2024.  In the June 10, 2024 Minute Order, the Court also
allowed Plaintiff thirty days to file a motion to amend the Complaint due to
the passing of Robert Buell (one of the Defendants), in order to name the
Estate of Robert Buell or another representative as a defendant in place of
Robert Buell.
 
            On July 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
instant Motion for Leave to Amend Complaint (the “Motion”) to add the Estate of
Robert Buell as Defendant.  Additionally,
Plaintiff requests leave to add a cause of action for breach of contract.  Defendants filed an opposition on             July 29, 2024, and Plaintiff filed a
reply on August 2, 2024.
             
DISCUSSION
“The court may, in furtherance of justice, and on
such terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading …”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1).)  Judicial policy favors resolution of all
disputed matters between the parties in the same lawsuit.  Thus, the court's discretion will usually be
exercised liberally to permit amendment of the pleadings.  (Nestle v. Santa Monica (1972) 6 Cal.3d
920, 939; Mabie v. Hyatt (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 581, 596 [“If discovery
and investigation develop factual grounds justifying a timely amendment to a
pleading, leave to amend must be liberally granted.”].)  The policy favoring amendment is so strong
that it is a rare case in which denial of leave to amend can be justified: “If
the motion to amend is timely made and the granting of the motion will not
prejudice the opposing party, it is error to refuse permission to amend; and,
where the refusal also results in a party being deprived of the right to assert
a meritorious cause of action or a meritorious defense, it is not only error
but an abuse of discretion.”  (Morgan
v. Sup.Ct. (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527, 530; Mabie v. Hyatt, supra, 61
Cal.App.4th at p. 596.) 
 
Courts are bound to apply a policy of great
liberality in permitting amendments to the complaint “at any stage of the
proceedings, up to and including trial,” absent prejudice to the adverse party.
 (Atkinson v. Elk Corp. (2003) 109
Cal.App.4th 739, 761, 135.)  If the
plaintiff is the party seeking leave to amend (knowing the trial will be
delayed), proximity to the trial date is not ground for denial.  As long as no prejudice to the defendant is
shown, the liberal policy regarding amendment prevails and it is an abuse of
discretion to refuse the amendment.  (Mesler
v. Bragg Mgmt. Co. (1985) 39 Cal.3d 290, 297.)  
 
If the party seeking the amendment has been
dilatory, and the delay has prejudiced the opposing party, the judge has
discretion to deny leave to amend.  (Hirsa
v. Sup. Ct. (Vickers) (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 486, 490.)  Prejudice
exists where the amendment would require delaying the trial, resulting in loss
of critical evidence or added costs of preparation, increased burden of
discovery, etc. (Magpali v. Farmers Group, Inc. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th
471, 486-488; see also P & D Consultants, Inc. v. City of Carlsbad
(2010) 190 Cal.App.4th 1332, 1345.)  
 
            Here, the Court
finds no indication that the amendment's purpose is dilatory. At this stage,
the Defendants would not be prejudiced by allowing the amendment sought since a
trial has not yet been set, nor has an answer been filed.  Moreover, the amendments are based upon the
same set of facts already pleaded.  (City
of Stanton v. Cox (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1557, 1563 [“If new facts are being
alleged, prejudice may easily result because of the inability of the other
party to investigate the validity of the factual allegations while engaged in
trial or to call rebuttal witnesses. If the same set of facts supports merely a
different theory…no prejudice can result.”].)
 
            In opposition, Defendant
argues that Plaintiff does not comply with California Rules of Court (“CRC”)
rule 3.1324.
 
Pursuant to CRC rule 3.1324(a), a motion to amend must:
(1) include a copy of the proposed amendment or amended pleading, which must be
serially numbered; and (2) state what allegations are proposed to be deleted
from or added to the previous pleading and where, by page, paragraph, and line
number, such allegations are located.  CRC
rule 3.1324(b) requires a separate declaration that accompanies the motion,
stating: (1) the effect of the amendment; (2) why the amendment is necessary
and proper; (3) when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were
discovered; and (4) the reason why the request for amendment was not made earlier.
 
            Here, Plaintiff
attached a Proposed First Amended Complaint to her Motion and indicated that the
only changes made were the addition of the phrase “the Estate of” preceding the
name Robert D. Buell, as well as the new Breach of Contract cause of action.  In her reply, Plaintiff provided a more
detailed description of the proposed changes to the Complaint by indicating the
page, paragraph and line number where the changes in the allegations are
located, and by highlighting them in bold typeface.  (Reply, pp. 3-4.)
 
The Court, thus, finds that Plaintiff has
substantially complied with the procedural requirements of CRC rule 3.1324, and
any minor deviation shall give way to the liberal policy regarding allowance of
amendments.  Judicial policy favors
resolution of all disputed matters between the parties and, therefore, the courts
have held that “there is a strong policy in favor of liberal allowance of
amendments.”  (Mesler v. Bragg
Management Co. (1985) 39 Cal.3d 290, 296-97; Ventura v. ABM Industries,
Inc. (2013) 212 Cal.App.4th 258, 268.)
            
RULING
            In view of the foregoing, the Court
GRANTS the Motion.  Plaintiff shall have
10 days’ leave to file an amended complaint. 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
