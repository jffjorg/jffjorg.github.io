BACKGROUND
 
This case arises from alleged injuries sustained by
Plaintiff from an automobile accident that occurred on February 24, 2021.
 
On February 23, 2023, Plaintiff Marvin Ernesto Bonilla
Martinez (“Plaintiff” or “Martinez”) filed the Complaint against Defendants
Madison Lenore Smith (“Smith”), Scott Halsey (“Halsey,” erroneously sued as
Halsey Scott) (collectively, “Defendants”), and Does 1 to 50, alleging two
causes of action: (1) Motor Vehicle Negligence, and (2) General Negligence. Subsequently,
on February 7, 2024, Defendants filed their Answer to the Complaint. 
 
On May 30, 2024, Defendants
filed the instant Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to Request for
Production of Documents, Set One (the “Motion”). 
 
No Opposition or Reply papers
have been received by the Court.
 
ANALYSIS
 
“Within 30 days after service of a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, the party to whom the demand is directed shall serve the
original of the response to it on the party making the demand, and a copy of
the response on all other parties who have appeared in the action, unless on motion
of the party making the demand, the court has shortened the time for response,
or unless on motion of the party to whom the demand has been directed, the
court has extended the time for response.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.260,
subd. (a).)
 
“If a party to whom a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely
response to it, the following rules shall apply: (a) The party to whom the
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any
objection to the demand, including one based on privilege or on the protection
for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court,
on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that
both of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has
subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections
2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280. (2) The party’s
failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or
excusable neglect. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subd. (a).)
 
A.   
Motion to Compel
Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One
 
Defendants’ counsel, David
J. Mendoza (“Mendoza”), attests that on March 6, 2024, Plaintiff was served
with the first set of Request for Production of Documents by email,
establishing that responses were due on April 9, 2024. (Mendoza Decl. ¶ 3, Ex.
“2.”) No responses were received by the established due date. (Id. ¶ 4.)
On May 1, 2024, Mendoza’s office emailed Plaintiff’s counsel, advising that no
responses had been received and requesting that Plaintiff serve responses,
without objection, by May 6, 2024. (Id. ¶ 5, Ex. “B.”) However, as of
the date of filing of the Motion, Plaintiff has not served any responses. (Id.
¶ 6.) 
 
Based on the above records,
the Court determines that Plaintiff failed to serve a timely response, thereby
waiving any objection to the demand, including those based on privilege or the
protection for work product, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300,
subdivision (a).
 
Nevertheless, under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300,
subdivision (a), “[t]he court, on motion, may relieve that party from this
waiver on its determination that both of the following conditions are
satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently served a response that is in
substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240,
and 2031.280. (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response was the
result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.”
 
Here,
Plaintiff does not file an Opposition to the Motion. Nor does Plaintiff move
separately for relief from the waiver. Additionally, there is no record
indicating any responses have been subsequently served by Plaintiff prior to
the hearing. Consequently, the Court finds that relief under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2031.300, subdivision(a) is unavailable in this circumstance.
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS the Motion.
 
A.   
Monetary
Sanctions
 
Monetary
sanctions, as outlined under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300
subdivision (c) are mandatory against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).) Additionally, California Rules
of Court rule 3.1348(A) further provides, “The Court may award sanctions under
the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even
though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was
withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed.” (Underlines added.)
 
The Court finds the mandatory sanction
applies in this case and it determines the total and reasonable amount of
attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work performed in connection with
the Motion to be $420.00, calculated based on a reasonable hourly rate of $180.00
for 2 hours reasonably spent, plus a $60.00 filing fee.
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS IN PART Defendants’ request for
monetary sanctions.
