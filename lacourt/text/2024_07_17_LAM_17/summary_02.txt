And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiffs' motion to compel discovery and issue sanctions. The plaintiffs, Sebastian Donovan and Arconex, are seeking to compel the defendants, Quantgene, Inc. and Johannes Bhakdi, to produce discovery and to impose sanctions for the defendants' failure to do so.

The judge has granted the motion in part, finding that the defendants are required to produce further discovery in response to the plaintiffs' requests for production (RFPs). However, the judge has also declined to impose issue or evidentiary sanctions on the defendants at this time.

The judge has ordered the defendants to produce all relevant discovery within 10 days of the entry of this order and has sanctioned the defendants, jointly and severally with counsel, $1,750.

The judge has also noted that the defendants' offer to provide additional data on June 26, 2024, resolves the plaintiffs' concerns about the defendants' failure to produce significant discovery.
