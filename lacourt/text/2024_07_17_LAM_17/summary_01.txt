Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Johnnie McGee, filed a lawsuit against the County of Los Angeles alleging discrimination, retaliation, and failure to prevent discrimination. The plaintiff moved to compel further responses to his special interrogatories, which ask about the race and ethnicity of Department personnel who have had their performance evaluation prepared by certain supervisors. The defendant agreed to supplement its responses and will provide the requested information. The court finds that the defendant's conduct is justified and declines to award sanctions. Therefore, the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses is moot. The case will proceed as scheduled, and parties who wish to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court by 4 p.m. the day prior to the hearing.
