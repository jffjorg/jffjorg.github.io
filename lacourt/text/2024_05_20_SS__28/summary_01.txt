And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has ruled on the motions to dismiss filed by Broutian Enterprises, Inc. and the Trustee and Trust. The Court finds that Broutian Enterprises, Inc. was unreasonably delayed in being named as a defendant, prejudicing the company. Therefore, the Court grants the motion to dismiss and dismisses Plaintiff's first amended complaint against Broutian Enterprises, Inc. with prejudice.

Similarly, the Court finds that the Trustee and Trust were not served with the summons and complaint within three years of filing the complaint, as required by law. Therefore, the Court dismisses Plaintiff's claims against the Trustee and Trust under Code of Civil Procedure sections 583.210 and 583.250.

The Court orders the moving parties to give notice of this ruling.
