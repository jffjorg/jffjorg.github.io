And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is about a case involving a settlement agreement between the Estate of William Jordison, Deceased, and the Plaintiff, Marguerita Ludwig. The Estate seeks a determination that its settlement with the Plaintiff is in good faith. The Lam Defendants oppose the motion, arguing that the Estate's liability is not capped at the policy limits of $100,000. The court has considered the moving, opposition, reply, and supplemental papers and rules as follows. The court finds that the Estate has proffered the policy limits of its only available insurance and has no other assets, and therefore, the Lam Defendants have failed to carry their burden of showing a lack of good faith. The court grants the motion and determines that the settlement agreement between the Estate and the Plaintiff is in good faith.
