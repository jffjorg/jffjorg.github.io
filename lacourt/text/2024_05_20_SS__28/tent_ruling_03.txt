 Case Number:  20STCV48300    Hearing Date:   May 20, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving and supplemental papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
December 17, 2020, Plaintiff Petrolina Marcial-Sernas (“Plaintiff”) filed this
action against Defendants Carly Chiarella (“Defendant”) and Does 1-50 for
negligence. 
On
February 1, 2023, Defendant filed an answer. 
On
March 26, 2024, Defendant filed (1) a motion to compel Plaintiff’s physical
examination and for sanctions, to be heard on April 24, 2024, (2) a motion to
compel Plaintiff’s responses to demand for inspection and production of
documents, set two, and for sanctions, and (3) a motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to specially prepared
interrogatories, set two, and for sanctions. 
The Court continued the hearing on motion to compel Plaintiff’s physical
examination to May 20, 2024, the date of the hearing on the other two motions.  Plaintiff did not file oppositions. 
On
April 16, 2024, Defendant filed a supplemental declaration stating that
Plaintiff had attended a physical examination on March 29, 2024, but Defendant still
wanted the Court to issue sanctions based on the fees Defendant incurred when Plaintiff
failed to appear at a previously-scheduled examination.  
Trial
is currently scheduled for June 12, 2024. 
PARTY’S REQUESTS 
Defendant
asks the Court (1) to compel
Plaintiff’s responses to demand for inspection and production of documents, set
two, and award sanctions, (2) to compel Plaintiff’s responses to specially prepared
interrogatories, set two, and award sanctions, and (3) to award sanctions on the motion to compel Plaintiff's attendance at a physical examination. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Inspection demand 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 provides: 
“If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
following rules shall apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party making the demand may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. 
“(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order compelling
a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in
addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(d) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent
exceptional circumstances, the court shall not impose sanctions on a party or
any attorney of a party for failure to provide electronically stored
information that has been lost, damaged, altered, or overwritten as a result of
the routine, good faith operation of an electronic information system. 
“(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter
any obligation to preserve discoverable information.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300.) 
B.   Interrogatories 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides: 
“If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails
to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may
move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition
of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that
sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.) 
          C.      Physical
examination 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.240 provides:         
“(a) If a plaintiff to whom a demand for a physical
examination under this article is directed fails to serve a timely response to
it, that plaintiff waives any objection to the demand. The court, on motion,
may relieve that plaintiff from this waiver on its determination that both of
the following conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The plaintiff has subsequently served a response
that is in substantial compliance with Section 2032.230. 
“(2) The plaintiff’s failure to serve a timely
response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The defendant may move for an order compelling
response and compliance with a demand for a physical examination. 
“(c) The court shall impose
a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel response and compliance with a demand for a physical examination, unless
it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust. 
“(d) If a plaintiff then fails to obey the order
compelling response and compliance, the court may make those orders that are
just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In
lieu of or in addition to that sanction the court may impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2032.240.) 
DISCUSSION 
A.   Motions to compel responses to discovery 
On February
28, 2024, Defendant served demand for inspection and production of documents,
set two, and specially prepared interrogatories, set two, on Plaintiff. 
Plaintiff
did not provide timely responses and had not provided responses by the time
Defendant filed these motions on March 16, 2024. 
The
Court grants Defendant’s motion to compel responses to the demand for
inspection and production of documents, set two, and orders Plaintiff to
provide verified code-compliant responses without objections and to produce the
documents, electronically stored information, and/or other things requested
without objections by June 18, 2024. 
The
Court grants Defendant’s motion to compel responses to the specially prepared
interrogatories, set two, and orders Plaintiff to provide verified
code-compliant responses to the specially prepared interrogatories without
objections by June 18, 2024. 
Defendant
requests sanctions on both motions.  Under
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300, sanctions are available
against parties, persons, and attorneys who unsuccessfully make or oppose a
motion to compel a response to interrogatories or requests for production. (See
Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c) [interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (c)
[demand for inspection].) Plaintiff did not make or oppose a motion to compel
responses to interrogatories or requests for production. Therefore, sanctions
are not available under these statutes.         
Other
statutes addressing misuse of the discovery process do not, by themselves,
authorize a sanctions award for these motions. (See Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.010.)  Code of Civil Procedure
section 2023.010 is “ ‘definitional’ and monetary sanctions may not be imposed
based solely on [the statute]. Monetary sanctions may be imposed only if
authorized by some other provision of the Discovery Act.” (L. Edmon & C. Karnow,
Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 8:1900, p.
8M-2; see Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030 [court may impose sanctions for misuse of
the discovery process “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter governing any
particular discovery method or other provision of this title”]; City of Los
Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 498-504,
review granted Jan. 23, 2023 with order permitting citation of opinion for its
persuasive value and to establish the existence of a conflict in authority that
would “allow trial courts to exercise discretion . . . to choose between sides
of any such conflict”.) 
California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a), provides: “The court may award sanctions under
the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery,
even though no opposition to the motion was filed . . . .”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1348(a).)  “ ‘Rules of court have the force of law and
are as binding as procedural statutes as long as they are not inconsistent with
statutory or constitutional law.’ ” (Fidelity National Home Warranty Company
Cases (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 812, 842, fn. 41, quoting In re I.V.
(2017) 11 Cal.App.5th 249, 256.) 
Interpreting rule 3.1348(a) to authorize an award of sanctions on the
motions to compel would be inconsistent with Code of Civil Procedure sections
2030.290 and 2031.300.) 
B.       Motion to compel physical examination 
On January
17, 2024, Defendant served a demand for Plaintiff’s physical examination.  The examination was scheduled for February
19, 2024 at 11:00 a.m. with orthopedic surgeon Neeraj Gupta, M.D.  Plaintiff did not object to the demand but
asked to change the time of the examination to 4:00 p.m.  Defendant granted the request.  On February 14, 2024, Plaintiff confirmed
that she would appear for the examination and requested a Spanish language
interpreter. 
At
4:15 p.m. on February 19, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel informed Defendant’s
counsel that Plaintiff could not appear for the examination.  Because of Plaintiffs non-appearance,
Defendant incurred an $800.00 cancellation fee and a $395.00 interpreter’s fee. 
Plaintiff
has not reimbursed Defendant for the cancellation and interpreter’s fees.  In addition to these fees, Defendant requests
sanctions based on the attorney time spent to prepare the motion and the filing fee. 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2032.240, subdivision (c), authorizes a sanctions
award “against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel response and compliance with a demand for a physical
examination . . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.240, subd. (c).)  Plaintiff did not make or oppose a motion to
compel under the statute.  Therefore, for
the reasons discussed above, sanctions are not available. 
CONCLUSION 

The
Court DENIES Defendant Carly Chiarella’s
motion to compel Plaintiff Petrolina
Marcial-Sernas’s physical examination as moot. 
The Court GRANTS Defendant Carly Chiarella’s motion to
compel Plaintiff Petrolina Marcial-Sernas’s responses to the
demand for inspection and production of documents, set two, and orders
Plaintiff Petrolina Marcial-Sernas to provide verified code-compliant responses
without objections and to produce the documents, electronically stored
information, and/or other things requested without objections by June 18, 2024. 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Carly Chiarella’s motion to compel Plaintiff Petrolina
Marcial-Sernas’s responses to specially prepared interrogatories,
set two, and orders Plaintiff Petrolina Marcial-Sernas to provide verified
code-compliant responses to the special interrogatories without objections by June 18, 2024. 
The
Court DENIES Defendant Carly Chiarella’s requests for sanctions.
