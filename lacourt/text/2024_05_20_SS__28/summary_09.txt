Here is the English-text summary:

The judge has granted the demurrer filed by Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) to the Plaintiff's first amended complaint. The Plaintiff, Jayme Mae LaPlante, filed a claim with the City of Los Angeles, Los Angeles Department of Public Works, and Los Angeles Department of Water and Power on April 29, 2022, after her mother, Jenelle Arnold, submitted a claim on her behalf. The claim was rejected on June 13, 2023. The Plaintiff argues that the claim presentation requirement was not complied with because she was not born until August 24, 2022, and her mother could have submitted the claim on her behalf. The Court finds that the Plaintiff did not comply with the claim presentation requirement and sustains the demurrer.
