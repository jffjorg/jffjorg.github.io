The judge's tentative ruling sustains Golden Lyon's demurrer to the second cause of action of the second amended complaint with 30 days leave to amend. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to allege facts showing that Golden Lyon ratified Cortes Leon's alleged harboring of Rivera Garcia for purposes of establishing "positive misconduct" by Golden Lyon that would make it liable for Cortes Leon's conduct as a joint participant.
