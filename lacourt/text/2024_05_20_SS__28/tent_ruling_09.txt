PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
LADWP

Plaintiff
asks the Court to overrule the demurrer. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
“The party against whom a complaint or cross-complaint
has been filed may object, by demurrer or answer as provided in Section 430.30,
to the pleading on any one or more of the following grounds: 
* * *
  “(e) The pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action. 
“(f) The pleading is uncertain. As used in this
subdivision, ‘uncertain’ includes ambiguous and unintelligible. . . .” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10,
subds. (e), (f).) 
In a
demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading
or by judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a) [“When any ground
for objection to a complaint, cross-complaint, or answer appears on the face
thereof, or from any matter of which the court is required to or may take
judicial notice, the objection on that ground may be taken by a demurrer to the
pleading”].) 
“For
the purpose of testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer
admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded (i.e., all ultimate
facts alleged, but not conclusions, deductions, or conclusions of facts or
law).”  (L. Edmon
and C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023)
¶ 7:43, p. 7(l)-25, emphasis omitted (Cal. Practice Guide).) 
The general rule is that the plaintiff need only
allege ultimate facts, not evidentiary facts. (Doe v. City of Los Angeles
(2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550 (Doe).) “All that is required of a plaintiff,
as a matter of pleading, even as against a special demurrer, is that his
complaint set forth the essential facts of the case with reasonable precision
and with sufficient particularity to acquaint the defendant with the nature,
source and extent of his cause of action.” (Rannard v. Lockheed Aircraft
Corp. (1945) 26 Cal.2d 149, 156-157.) “[D]emurrers for uncertainty are
disfavored, and are granted only if the pleading is so incomprehensible that a
defendant cannot reasonably respond.” (Mahan v. Charles W. Chan Ins. Agency,
Inc. (2017) 14 Cal.App.5th 841, 848, fn. 3, citing Lickiss v. Fin.
Indus. Regulatory Auth. (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 1125, 1135 (Lickiss).)
In addition, even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, courts
strictly construe a demurrer for uncertainty “because ambiguities can be
clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Lickiss, supra,
208 Cal.App.4th at p. 1135, citing Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc.
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)
DISCUSSION 
A.   The first amended complaint 
The first
amended complaint alleges the following (in part): 
“On April 29, 2022, acting as Plaintiff's mother and
guardian ad litem, Jenelle Arnold submitted a government claim form with
defendants City of Los Angeles, City of Los Angeles Department of Public Works,
and City of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (hereinafter the ‘City
Defendants’). The claim form contains . . .: the date [‘March 21, 2022’] and
place [‘Vista Del Mar- Imperial Highway Los Angeles, CA’] of the accident or
event out of which the claim arose; a general description of the damage, loss
or indebtedness incurred [‘Death’]; the names of any public employees allegedly
responsible [‘Names unknown at present. L.A. City Employees and an L.A. City
contractor (Parkia, Inc.) created a dangerous condition on Vista Del Mar that
caused the death of Jay LaPlante’]; and the amount of damages sought [‘$25,000,000.00’].
The claim form further contained photographs of the location where the subject
incident occurred, a copy of the police report, and Jay LaPlante's death
certificate. (See Exhibit ‘1.’) The claim form provided the City Defendants
with sufficient information to enable it to investigate and evaluate the merits
of the claim, assess liability, and where appropriate, to settle claims without
the expense of litigation. This claim was rejected by operation of law on or
about June 13, 2023.”       
B.   Claim presentation requirement 
“Under
the Tort Claims Act, a plaintiff may not maintain an action for money or
damages against a public entity unless first a written claim has been presented
to the public entity and rejected in whole or in part or deemed rejected by
operation of law.” (Sofranek v. County of Merced (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th
1238, 1246 (Sofranek), quoting Gov. Code, §§ 905, 905.2, 945.4.)
“Failure to timely present a claim for money or damages to a public entity bars
a plaintiff from filing a lawsuit against that entity.” (Ibid., citing State
of California v. Superior Court (Bodde) (2004) 32 Cal.4th 1234, 1245.)
“Before a cause of action may be stated, a plaintiff must allege either compliance with this procedure or
circumstances excusing compliance.” (Ibid.) 
Under
Government Code section 911.2, subdivision (a), “personal injury claims against
a local governmental entity must be presented to the entity within six months
after accrual of the cause of action . . . .” (Sofranek, supra,
146 Cal.App.4th at p. 1246.) Claims relating to other causes of action must be
presented within one year after the accrual of the cause of action. (Ibid.)
A party may amend his or her claim during these time periods if the claim as
amended relates to the same transaction or occurrence which gave rise to the
original claim, but the amendment “shall be considered a part of the original
claim for all purposes.” (Ibid., quoting Gov. Code, § 910.6, subd. (a).)  If the governmental entity provides the
claimant with written notice of rejection, “the claimant must bring an action
against the entity within six months after ‘the date such notice is personally
delivered or deposited in the mail.’ ” (Ibid., quoting Gov. Code, §
945.6, subd. (a)(1).) “This six-month deadline ‘is mandatory and must be
strictly complied with.’ ” (Ibid., quoting Julian v. City of San
Diego (1986) 183 Cal.App.3d 169, 176.)  
C.   Analysis 
LADWP
asks the Court to sustain its demurrer because Plaintiff did not comply with
the claim presentation requirements of the Tort Claims Act.  While Arnold submitted a timely claim, Arnold’s
claim does not satisfy the claims presentation requirement for Plaintiff to pursue
a claim.  The
time for Plaintiff to submit a claim has expired, requiring the Court to
sustain the demurrer. 
In
response, Plaintiff asserts that Arnold’s claim and a demand for preservation of evidence sufficiently put LADWP on notice that Plaintiff was making a claim.  The Court has reviewed the documents on which Plaintiff relies and concludes they cannot be construed as a claim on behalf of Plaintiff. 
Plaintiff
argues that she could not comply with the claims presentation requirement because
she had not been born when Arnold submitted her own claim on April 29, 2022.  Plaintiff was born on August 24, 2022, within
six months of the March 21, 2022 accident that gave rise to the case.  Arnold, Plaintiff’s mother and guardian ad litem, could have
submitted a claim on Plaintiff's behalf before the six-month period ended. 
The
Court sustains the demurrer. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court SUSTAINS the demurrer
of Defendant Los Angeles Department of Water and Power to Plaintiff Jayme Mae LaPlante’s first amended complaint with 30 days leave to amend. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days of the date of the hearing.
