     CASE NO.: 24VECV00513
 
ORDER
  DENYING PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION OF
  DOCUMENTS AFTER COURT ORDER 
 
 
 



 


 
I.              
BACKGROUND 
This case
arises out of an unpaid wages dispute between Plaintiffs Alma Ramirez, Jessica
Jimenez, and Alexandra Grady (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) against Defendants Reliant
Life Shares, LLC (“Reliant”), Scott Grady, and Longevity Asset Advisors, LLC
(collectively, “Defendants”). Plaintiffs allege Defendants failed to pay them
any compensation for work performed for Defendants from approximately June 15,
2023, through August 30, 2023, among other wage-related violations. (See Complaint,
¶ 40.)
Plaintiffs now seek to
compel Reliant’s responses to their request for production of documents after
Court order. 
II.           
PROCEDURAL
HISTORY
On February
2, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their Complaint, alleging (1) Violation of Labor Code
§1197 and IWC Wage Orders; (2) Violation of Labor Code §204, §210 &        §218; (3) Violation of Labor Code §1198
and §510; (4) Violation of Labor Code         
§§201, 202 & 203; (5) Violation of Labor Code §226; and (6)
Violation of Business and Professions Code §17200, et seq.
On May 7,
2024, Reliant filed its Answer.  
On August 15,
2024, this Court granted Plaintiffs’ Motions to Compel Reliant’s responses to their request for production
of documents (“RFPs”) and form and special interrogatories. The Court also
granted Plaintiffs’ request for an order deeming the truth of the matters
admitted in Plaintiffs’ requests for admissions.
On October 4,
2024, Plaintiffs filed the instant Motion to Compel responses to their RFPs
(“Motion”) per this Court’s August 15, 2024, Order (“Order”). 
On October 8,
2024, Reliant filed its Notice of Pending Bankruptcy and Automatic Stay of
Proceeding (“Notice”). 
On November 5,
2024, Reliant filed its Opposition. 
On November
12, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their Reply.

III.        
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.            
Request for Production
 A party upon whom a demand for the production
of documents has been made has 30 days after service of the demand to respond.
(See Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.260(a).)[1] The
propounding and responding parties may agree to extend the time for response. (See
Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.270(a).) When a party fails to serve a timely
response, the propounding party’s remedy is to seek a motion to compel
response. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300(b).) A responding party that
does not provide responses waives the right to object to the demand, including
objections based on privilege or work product. (See Code Civ. Proc. §
2031.300(a).)     
“If a party then fails
to obey the order compelling a response, the court may make those orders that
are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction,
or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300(c).) 
IV.         
ANALYSIS
Plaintiffs
argue Reliant has failed to comply with the Court’s Order by failing to provide
response to Plaintiffs’ RFPs, despite Plaintiffs’ multiple attempts to
follow-up. (See Motion, pg. 1.) In their Reply, Plaintiffs acknowledge
the “bankruptcy proceeding likely stays further discovery from Reliant” but
request “$4,640.00 as the amount of reasonable expenses, including attorney’s
fees and costs, incurred in bringing this motion plus a statutory sanction.” (Reply,
pp. 8-9.)
This case was
automatically stayed when Reliant filed for bankruptcy. (See 11 U.S.C. §
362.) “The stay's scope is quite broad and applies to almost any type of formal
or informal action against the debtor or property of the estate.” (In re
Swintek (9th Cir. 2018) 906 F.3d 1100, 1103.) Accordingly, Plaintiffs’
Motion is DENIED and the Court declines to issue Plaintiffs’ requested
sanctions. 
V.            
CONCLUSION
Based on the
foregoing, the Court the Court DENIES
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Responses to Requests for Production of Documents
After Court Order. 
IT IS SO
ORDERED.
DATED:      November 18, 2024
