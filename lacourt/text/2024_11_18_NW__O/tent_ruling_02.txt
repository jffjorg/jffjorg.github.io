[2] The Court will consider Plaintiff’s untimely Opposition. “No paper may be
rejected for filing on the ground that it was untimely submitted for filing. If
the court, in its discretion, refuses to consider a late filed paper, the
minutes or order must so indicate.” (Rules of Court, Rule 3.1300(d).)
Additionally, “a trial court has broad discretion to accept or reject
late-filed papers.” (Rancho Mirage Country Club Homeowners Assn. v.
Hazelbaker 2 Cal.App.5th 252, 262.) If Defendants wish to have a
continuance to file a Reply, the Court will grant one. Otherwise, Defendants’
counsel may address the Opposition orally at the hearing.
