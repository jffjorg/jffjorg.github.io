And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motion to compel responses to requests for production of documents after a court order. The plaintiffs had previously filed a motion to compel responses from the defendants, Reliant Life Shares, LLC, Scott Grady, and Longevity Asset Advisors, LLC, but the defendants failed to comply with the court's order. The plaintiffs argue that the defendants have failed to provide responses to their requests for production of documents, despite multiple attempts to follow up. The judge has denied the motion and declined to issue the plaintiffs' requested sanctions, citing the automatic stay of the bankruptcy proceedings filed by Reliant. The judge notes that the stay's scope is quite broad and applies to almost any type of formal or informal action against the debtor or property of the estate.
