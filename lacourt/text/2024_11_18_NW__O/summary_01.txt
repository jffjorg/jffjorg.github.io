And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion to compel the plaintiffs to provide code-compliant responses to their requests for production of documents. The motion was filed after the plaintiffs failed to respond to the defendants' requests, despite multiple extensions. The judge finds that the plaintiffs waived their right to object to the demand for documents and that their failure to serve a timely response was not due to mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.

The judge also grants the defendants' request for discovery sanctions in the amount of $685.00, which reflects the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by the defendants in bringing the motion. The judge orders the plaintiffs' counsel to pay the sanctions on or before December 31, 2024.

The judge's ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and the parties' agreements. The judge cites several cases, including Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants and Pelton-Shepherd Industries, Inc. v. Delta Packaging Products, Inc., to support its ruling.
