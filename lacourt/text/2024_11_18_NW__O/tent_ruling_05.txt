ORDER
  SUSTAINING IN PART AND OVERRULING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ DEMURRER WITH AND
  WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND
 
 



 


 
I.        INTRODUCTION
This case
arises out of alleged violations of the Song-Beverly Act. Plaintiff Anthony Joseph Nanula (“Plaintiff”) alleges he purchased a defective
2018 Ford Transit Connect (“Subject Vehicle”) on May 7, 2018, from Defendant Ford
Motor Company (“Ford”) that Defendant DCH Ford of Thousand Oaks, erroneously
sued as DCH Ford Thousand Oaks (“DCH”)(collectively, “Defendants”) failed to
repair and that Ford subsequently failed to repurchase.  
Defendants now
demurrer to all Plaintiff’s causes of action.

II.      PROCEDURAL
HISTORY
On September

4, 2024, Plaintiff filed his Opposition. 
On November
8, 2024, Defendants filed their Reply. 
III.     LEGAL
STANDARD
A demurrer is a pleading used to test
the legal sufficiency of other pleadings. It raises issues of law, not
fact, regarding the form or content of the opposing party’s pleading
(complaint, answer or cross-complaint). (See Code Civ. Proc. §§
422.10, 589; see Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116
Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)[1] It
is not the function of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the
complaint; and for purposes of the ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in
the complaint are assumed to be true. (See Donabedian, 116 Cal.App.4th
at 994.) 
“We treat the demurrer as admitting all
material facts properly pleaded but not contentions, deductions or conclusions
of fact or law. We accept the factual allegations of the complaint as true and
also consider matters which may be judicially noticed. [Citation.]” (Mitchell
v. California Department of Public Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007; Del
E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604
[“the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true, however improbable
they may be”].) Allegations are to be liberally construed. (See Code
Civ. Proc. § 452.) A demurrer may be brought if insufficient facts are stated
to support the cause of action asserted. (See Code Civ. Proc. §
430.10(e).)  
A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a
complaint as a matter of law.”  (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010)
183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.) “[T]he court gives the complaint a reasonable
interpretation, and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded.” (Id.) In testing the sufficiency of the
complaint, the court must assume the truth of (1) the properly pleaded factual
allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably inferred from those expressly
pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (See Blank v. Kirwan (1985)
39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence
or other extrinsic matters. (See SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984)
153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) No other extrinsic evidence can be considered. (See
Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 881 [error for court
to consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting demurrer]; see also Afuso
v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862
[disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos.
(1988) 46 Cal.3d 287] [error to consider contents of release not part of court
record].) Accordingly, “[w]hether the plaintiff will be able to prove the
pleaded facts is irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer.” (Stevens v.
Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 605, 609-10.) 
A demurrer can only be sustained when
it disposes of an entire cause of action. (See Poizner v. Fremont
General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of Hawaiian
Gardens Redev. Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.) Leave to
amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. (See Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The
burden is on the complainant to show the Court a pleading can be amended
successfully. (Id.) However, “[i]f there is any reasonable possibility
that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to sustain a
demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245). 
IV.     MEET AND CONFER
Before
filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party shall meet
and confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference with the party
who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of
determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a),
(emphasis added).) A declaration must be filed with a demurrer regarding the
results of the meet and confer process. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a)(3).)
          Ford and
DCH’s counsel declares they met and conferred with Plaintiff’s counsel on September
17, 2024, but the parties were unable to reach an agreement. (See Declaration
of Chen Fei Liu filed October 14, 2024, ¶
2.) Ford and DCH’s counsel does not detail how the parties met and conferred,
however, and this Court is thus unable to evaluate whether they fulfilled their
meet and confer requirements. The Court will rule on the Demurrer but reminds
counsel to specify the method of communication in future meet and confer
declarations.

V.       ANALYSIS
A.       Plaintiff’s
First through Fourth Causes of Action are Time Barred as Currently Pled.
The
four-year statute of limitations of Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”) § 2725 applies
to claims brought under the Song-Beverly Act whether for express or implied
warranty. (See Krieger v. Nick Alexander Imports, Inc. (1991) 234
Cal.App.3rd 205, 213-14 (1991); see Mexia v. Rinker Boat Co., Inc.
(2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 1297, 1306.)
Breach
of express warranty causes of action (Plaintiff’s first through third causes of
action), accrue “when tender of delivery is made, except that where a
warranty explicitly extends to future performance of the goods and
discovery of the breach must await the time of such performance the cause of
action accrues when the breach is or should have been discovered.” (U.
Com. Code § 2725(2)(emphasis added).) Accrual of breach of express warranty
causes of action can therefore be postponed until discovery of the breach—that
is, in the Song-Beverly express warranty context, after a plaintiff has
unsuccessfully attempted to repair their vehicle. (See Krieger, 234
Cal.App.3rd at 217-219 (“If we adopted the position urged by respondent and
held that a cause of action for breach of express warranty accrues on tender of
delivery, before the seller has an opportunity to repair any defects, we would
undermine the legislative purpose that the parties attempt to resolve any
deficiencies in performance before resorting to the remedies provided in the
Act.”).)
Defendants
argue Plaintiff’s first, second, third, and fourth causes of action are barred
by the Song-Beverly Act’s four-year statute of limitations for breach of
express and implied warranty. (See Demurrer, pp. 6-7.)  
In
opposition, Plaintiff argues “the statute of limitations defense is not clearly
and affirmatively apparent from the allegations in the Complaint and Ford’s
argument cannot be maintained on demurrer.” (Opposition, pg. 4.) 
Plaintiff
states, under the header “TOLLING OF THE STATUTES OF LIMITATION,” “Plaintiff
discovered Defendant's wrongful conduct alleged herein shortly before the
filing of the complaint, as the Vehicle continued to exhibit symptoms of
defects following FMC's unsuccessful attempts to repair them.” (Complaint, ¶ 24
(emphasis added).) For the purpose of testing the sufficiency of the cause of
action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded
(i.e., all ultimate facts alleged, but not contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law). (See Serrano v. Priest (1971) 5 Cal.3d 584,
591.) Here, Plaintiff’s threadbare, copy and paste attempt to plead around a
potential statute of limitation defense is conclusory. Plaintiff does not state
the time and manner of the discovery; there are no allegations to suggest when
Plaintiff brought the subject vehicle to repair the alleged “defects and
nonconformities” and for how many times. Plaintiff cannot defeat Defendants’
statute of limitations argument by making his Complaint so general and devoid
of facts so as to be immune from demurrer—Plaintiff must allege material facts.

Plaintiff’s
allegations are also insufficient to state a cause of action for breach of the
implied warranty of merchantability. It is the general rule that implied
warranties do not cover future performance. (See Cardinal Health 301, Inc.
v. Tyco Electronics Corp. (2008) 169 Cal.App.4th 116, 134.) “Because an
implied warranty is one that arises by operation of law rather than by an
express agreement of the parties, courts have consistently held it is not a
warranty that ‘explicitly extends to future performance of the goods ....’.” (Id.
(citations omitted); see also Carrau v. Marvin Lumber & Cedar Co.
(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 281, 291 (concluding the future performance exception
applies only when “a seller expressly warrants a product for a specified number
of years.”).) Thus, per UCC § 2725(2), Plaintiff’s fourth cause of action
accrued “when tender of delivery [was] made.” Here, Plaintiff alleges he
entered into a warranty contract with Ford “[o]n or about May 7, 2018,” over
six years before he filed the instant action. (Complaint, ¶ 7.) Therefore,
Plaintiff’s fourth cause of action is clearly barred by the statute of
limitations. 
Accordingly,
the Court SUSTAINS Defendants’ Demurrer as to Plaintiff’s first through third
causes of action WITH LEAVE TO AMEND and SUSTAINS the Demurrer WITHOUT LEAVE TO
AMEND as to Plaintiff’s fourth cause of action.
B.      Plaintiff
Sufficiently Pleads his Fifth Cause of Action for Negligent Repair.  
Defendants
argue Plaintiff’s fifth cause of action for negligent repair is barred by the economic
loss rule as the claim arises from (and is not independent of) the warranty
contract and Plaintiff is only seeking damages for the cost of the repair to
the Subject Vehicle. (See Demurrer, pp. 7-10.) Defendants also argue
Plaintiff fails to plead the essential element of damages. (See id. at p.
10.) 
The
necessary elements for negligence are: (1) the existence of a legal duty of
care that the defendant owed to the plaintiff; (2) breach; (3) causation; and
(4) damages. (See County of Santa Clara v. Atlantic Richfield Co.
(2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 292, 318; see also CACI No. 1220.)
Under
the economic loss rule, a plaintiff is precluded from recovery in tort where
her damages consist solely of an economic loss. (See Seely v. White
Motor Co. (1965) 63 Cal.2d 9, 17-18.) “California Courts define economic
loss as ‘damages for inadequate value, costs of repair and replacement of the
defective product or consequent loss of profits—without any claim of personal
injury or damages to other property.’” (Department of Water & Power of
City of Los Angeles v. ABB Power T & D Co. (C.D. Cal. 1995) 902 F.Supp.
1178, 1186, fn. 4.) The economic loss rule requires a purchaser to recover in
contract for purely economic loss due to disappointed expectations unless she
can demonstrate harm above and beyond a broken contractual promise. (See
Robinson Helicopter Co., Inc. v. Dana Corp. (2004) 34 Cal.4th 979, 988, 993.)
There
exist four (4) exceptions to the economic loss rule barring recovery in tort in
a breach of contract action: (1) where the breach of duty directly caused
physical injury; (2) where there was a breach of the covenant of good faith and
fair dealing in insurance contracts; (3) for wrongful discharge in violation of
fundamental public policy; or (4) where the contract was fraudulently
induced. (See Erlich v. Menezes (1999) 21 Cal.4th 543,
551-552; see Robinson, 34 Cal.4th at 989-990.)
          Here,
Plaintiff’s negligent repair cause of action is alleged only against DCH and is
sparse in its factual support. Plaintiff alleges he presented the Subject Vehicle
to DCH for repair, that DCH owed and breached their duty to repair the Subject
Vehicle, and DCH’s negligence “was a proximate cause of Plaintiff's damages.”
(Complaint, ¶¶ 54-58.) 
As
sparse as these allegations are, they appear to have arisen independently of
Plaintiff’s warranty with Ford and therefore circumvent the economic loss rule.
Plaintiff has not alleged a warranty or other contractual relationship with DCH;
rather, Plaintiff’s allegations against DCH concern DCH’s duty to Plaintiff to
use ordinary care and skill to repair the Subject Vehicle. If DCH was obligated
to make the repair, it was because of its relationship with Ford, not with
Plaintiff. Presumably, Ford reimburses or contracts with DCH to pay for each
warranted repair that DCH performs. There is no promise in the warranty that DCH
will successfully make those repairs. Instead, DCH’s duty to Plaintiff—to
reasonably perform the repair—arises from tort, and the general duty of
reasonable care that each person owes each other. Therefore, Plaintiff’s fifth
cause of action is distinct from a failure to perform under the warranty. The
warranty was between Ford and Plaintiff, and, even though DCH was not
successful at repairing the Vehicle, the failure to perform the warranty was
Ford’s.
The
Court also finds Plaintiff’s damages allegations sufficient at the pleading
stage. Though general, Plaintiff does plead he was damaged by DCH’s breach. (See
Complaint, ¶ 58.) Because of this, it is not yet clear that the only
potential damages were the cost of the repairs, and Plaintiff never actually
states these were his only damages. There is case law holding that “the general
measure of damages where injury to property is capable of being repaired is the
reasonable cost of repair together with the value of lost use during the period
of injury." (Erlich v. Menezes (1999) 21 Cal.4th 543, 555.)
Therefore, even if Plaintiff did not pay for the repairs, he could still have
been damaged in time lost.
Accordingly,
the Court OVERRULES Defendants’ Demurrer to Plaintiff’s fifth cause of action
for negligent repair. 
VI.    
CONCLUSION
         
Based on the foregoing analysis, the Court SUSTAINS Defendants’ Demurrer as to
Plaintiff’s first through third causes of action WITH LEAVE TO AMEND and
SUSTAINS the Demurrer WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND as to Plaintiff’s fourth cause of
action.
          The
Court also OVERRULES Defendants’ Demurrer to Plaintiff’s fifth cause of action
for negligent repair.
          Plaintiff
has until December 13, 2024, to amend his Complaint.
          IT
IS SO ORDERED.
