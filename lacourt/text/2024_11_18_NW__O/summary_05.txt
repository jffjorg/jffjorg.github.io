Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Anthony Joseph Nanula v. Ford Motor Company, DCH Ford of Thousand Oaks, and DOES 1-10. The Court has sustained the demurrer filed by the Defendants as to Plaintiff's first through third causes of action, with leave to amend. This means that the Plaintiff's claims for breach of express warranty, breach of implied warranty, and violation of the Song-Beverly Act are dismissed, but the Plaintiff has the opportunity to refile a revised complaint that addresses the deficiencies identified by the Court.

The Court has also sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to the Plaintiff's fourth cause of action, which alleges a breach of the implied warranty of merchantability. This means that the Plaintiff's claim for breach of the implied warranty of merchantability is dismissed and cannot be refiled.

However, the Court has overruled the demurrer filed by the Defendants as to the Plaintiff's fifth cause of action, which alleges negligent repair. This means that the Plaintiff's claim for negligent repair is allowed to proceed to the next stage of the litigation.

The Court has given the Plaintiff until December 13, 2024, to amend his complaint to address the deficiencies identified by the Court.
