And the English text summary:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. The motion was defective because it clumped multiple causes of action together under one issue, and the defendants failed to establish the absence of a triable issue of material fact on several issues. The defendants also made contradictory statements in their motion, and failed to provide sufficient evidence to support their arguments. As a result, the judge has denied the motion and ordered the plaintiff to provide notice of the ruling within five days.
