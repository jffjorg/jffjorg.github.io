And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for alternative service, which would have allowed the plaintiff to serve the defendants by posting and mailing. However, the judge has granted the plaintiff's alternative motion to extend the time to serve the defendants. The plaintiff was seeking to serve the defendants because they had been difficult to locate. The judge has given the plaintiff 30 additional days to complete service on the defendants. The case management conference and order to show cause regarding failure to file proof of service have been advanced and continued to July 11, 2024. The plaintiff must notify the court of the ruling within five calendar days.
