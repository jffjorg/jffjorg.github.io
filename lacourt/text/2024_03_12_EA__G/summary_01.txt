And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Heda Construction Inc. and Hirbohd Hedayat against Consumers Pipe & Supply Co. The court has OVERRULED the demurrer, finding that the Complaint states a cause of action for breach of contract and breach of personal guaranty. The court has also DENIED the motion to strike, finding that the Complaint does not contain any allegations that are not supported by the evidence.

The judge has ordered the defendants to file their Answer to the Complaint within ten (10) days. The court has also scheduled a hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike for March 12, 2024.

The court's ruling is based on the allegations in the Complaint, which state that Consumers Pipe & Supply Co. extended credit to Heda Construction Inc. and Hirbohd Hedayat failed to make payments. The court has found that the Complaint adequately states a cause of action for breach of contract and breach of personal guaranty, and that the defendants' demurrer and motion to strike are without merit.
