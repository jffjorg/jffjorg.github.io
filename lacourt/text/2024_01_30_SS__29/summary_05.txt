And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has granted the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Michael B. Daurio, attorney for Jesus Armando Baylon Marin, the plaintiff in the case. The motion was filed on December 13, 2023, and no opposition was filed. The judge finds that the attorney-client relationship has broken down, significantly impeding counsel's ability to prosecute the matter. The court has reviewed the requisite forms filed by counsel, which include a notice of motion, a declaration, and a proposed order, and finds that counsel has established sufficient cause to be relieved as counsel. The order granting the motion is effective upon the filing with the court of proof of service of the signed order on the client, and counsel is ordered to give notice.
