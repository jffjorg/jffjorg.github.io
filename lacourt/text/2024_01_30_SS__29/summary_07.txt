And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the Defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment entered against it on September 14, 2023. The Defendant, the City of Los Angeles, claims that the default was due to severe staffing issues and a mistake by its counsel in failing to assign the case to a trial deputy. The Judge has found that the default occurred due to excusable neglect and that the Defendant has acted diligently in seeking relief by filing the motion within six months of the default. As a result, the default is hereby set aside and the Defendant is granted leave to file its answer within seven days. The Court sets a Trial Setting Conference in approximately 30 days and orders the Defendant to give notice.
