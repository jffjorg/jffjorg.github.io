And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to deem the truth of the matters asserted in the request for admissions served on the defendant. The request for sanctions is also granted in part. The plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendant on March 1, 2022, and the defendant filed an answer on June 24, 2022. The plaintiff served the request for admissions on February 16, 2023, but the defendant has not responded. The court finds that the defendant's failure to respond to the request for admissions constitutes a misuse of the discovery process and awards sanctions to the plaintiff. The sanctions are set at $337.50, calculated based on 1.5 hours of attorney work at an hourly billing rate of $225.00. The defendant is ordered to pay the sanctions within 30 days of notice of the ruling.
