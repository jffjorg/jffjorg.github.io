  Case Number:  20STCV26702    Hearing Date:   January 30, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion for Relief from Automatic Stay to Proceed Against Defendants Not Subject to the Stay filed by Plaintiff Jonathan Weir. TentativePlaintiff’s motion is DENIED on the ground that it seeks an affirmative order that is unnecessary. By operation of law, the automatic stay of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code applies only to Defendant Thrifty Payless, Inc. only.  This action is not stayed as to Defendants Iovate Health Sciences U.S.A. Inc., Steuben Foods, Inc., and SIG Combibloc, Inc.BackgroundPlaintiff Jonathan Weir (“Plaintiff”) alleges that on October 16, 2019, he suffered severe injuries after he swallowed a foreign object in a protein shake.  Plaintiff filed the Complaint in this action on July 15, 2020, asserting causes of action for negligence and products liability against Iovate Health Sciences U.S.A. Inc. (“Iovate”), Rite Aid Corporation (“Rite Aid”), and Does 1 through 25. On August 20 and 28, 2020, Iovate and Rite Aid filed their Answers to the Complaint. On April 7, 2021, Plaintiff amended his Complaint to name Defendant Thrifty Payless, Inc. (“Thrifty”) as Doe 1. On May 4, 2021, the Court, at the request of Plaintiff, dismissed all claims in the Complaint against Rite Aid without prejudice. On May 10, 2021, Thrifty filed its Answer to the Complaint. On September 23, 2021, Plaintiff amended his Complaint to name Defendant Steuben Foods, Inc. (“Steuben”) as Doe 2.  Steuben filed its Answer to the Complaint on January 21, 2022. On April 28, 2022, Steuben filed a Cross-Complaint against SIG Combibloc, Inc. (“SIG”) and Roes 1 through 25.  SIG filed its Answer to the Cross-Complaint, as well as its own Cross-Complaint against Moes 1 through 25, on June 2, 2022. On May 18, 2022, Plaintiff amended his Complaint to name SIG as Doe 3.  SIG filed its Answer to the Complaint on June 16, 2022. On October 20, 2023, Thrifty filed a notice that it had filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (title 11 of the United States Code). The notice advised that “as a result of the bankruptcy filing, any further action against ‘the Debtors’ is stayed under Bankruptcy Doe section 362(a).” Thrifty’s notice defined the term “the Debtors” as Thrifty and “certain of its affiliates.” On October 25, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant motion.  Plaintiff’s motion is entitled as “Notice of Motion and Motion for Relief from Automatic Stay to Proceed Against Defendants Not Subject to the Stay.”  In the text of the motion, Plaintiff states that he is seeking “an order directing that this action is only stayed as to defendants Thrifty Payless, Inc. and Rite Aid Corporation, but not as to the remaining three defendants.” On December 1, 2023, Iovate filed a response to the motion.  Some rhetoric aside, Iovate agrees that the automatic stay set forth in the Bankruptcy Code does not apply to the non-debtor co-defendants in this litigation (Iovate, Steuben, and SIG). Legal StandardAs soon as a bankruptcy case is filed, an automatic stay immediately goes into effect and generally prevents creditors, and other parties, from taking most actions against property of the bankruptcy estate, the debtor, and the debtor's property. This injunction continues until a bankruptcy court order lifting the stay has been entered or the stay has expired. (11 USC § 362.) The stay arises automatically by operation of law upon filing of the bankruptcy petition. No court order is required to activate the stay. (11 USC § 362(a).)Judicial proceedings in violation of the automatic stay are void. (Sindler v. Brennan (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1353 [trial court’s dismissal of case violated automatic stay and was void on its face]; see also, e.g., Hillis Motors, Inc. v. Hawaii Auto. Dealers' Ass'n (9th Cir.1993) 997 F.2d 581, 585-86 [“actions taken in violation of the automatic stay are void”].)DiscussionThrifty filed a petition under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code on October 15, 2023.  Under the automatic stay of federal bankruptcy law, the action against Thrifty is stayed.Any request for relief from the automatic stay must be addressed to the bankruptcy court, not to this Court.  This Court has no power to grant relief from the automatic stay.The automatic stay as to Thrifty has no effect, however, on unaffiliated co-defendants in civil litigation, including, in this case, Iovate, Steuben, and SIG. (Plaintiff’s claims against Rite Aid were dismissed almost three years ago.) As the Court of Appeal has explained, “the automatic stay of judicial proceedings against a debtor in bankruptcy does not apply to nondebtor codefendants.” (Higgins v. Super. Ct. (2017) 15 Cal.App.5th 973, 979 [quoting Cross v. Cooper (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 357, 365].) Accordingly, this case may proceed against Iovate, Steuben, and SIG, and no court order granting “relief” from the automatic stay, or “directing” the parties regarding the scope of the automatic stay, is needed.Plaintiff states that some courts have made an exception to this rule when the debtor is an indispensable party.  (Motion, at pp. 4-5.)  Here, however, no party contends that Thrifty is an indispensable party as to the claims against the other defendants or that the claims against the other defendants should be (or are) stayed.  (Ibid.; see also Response, at p. 3.) Conclusion Plaintiff’s motion is DENIED on the ground that it seeks an affirmative order that is unnecessary on a matter that is undisputed. By operation of law, this action is stayed as to Thrifty Payless, Inc. only.  This action is not stayed as to Defendants Iovate Health Sciences U.S.A. Inc., Steuben Foods, Inc., and SIG Combibloc, Inc.Moving party is ORDERED to give notice.
