And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of defendant Dejanae Zelaya. Zelaya was properly served with a deposition notice, but failed to appear. The judge finds that Zelaya's opposition is without merit and that she has an obligation to appear for her deposition under the Civil Discovery Act. The judge also grants the plaintiff's request for sanctions against Zelaya, ordering her to pay $660 to the plaintiff. The judge denies the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of non-party witness David T. Main, D.C. due to a lack of proof of personal service. The judge admonishes Zelaya that further violations of her obligations under the Civil Discovery Act may lead to further and escalating sanctions.
