And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Defendant Truman Shackelford to terminate sanctions against Plaintiff Melissa Cantarero. The Plaintiff failed to respond to discovery requests and failed to comply with the Court's order to respond to discovery requests, despite being ordered to pay sanctions of $2,092.50. The Judge finds that this is substantial discovery abuse and that serious sanctions are warranted. However, the Judge denies the motion for terminating sanctions, citing that the Defendant has not shown a history or pattern of willful abuse or repeated violations that have not been (or cannot be) cured by lesser sanctions. The Judge also notes that a terminating sanction would create a "windfall" for the Defendant. The motion is denied without prejudice to the Defendant seeking other sanctions or seeking a terminating sanction at a later stage of the proceedings.
