A&N INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES, LLC, et.

                       Cross-Defendants.


 



BACKGROUND
            On July 13, 2021, Plaintiff A&N
Industrial Properties, LLC filed a complaint against Defendants Bart &
Judy’s Bakery, Inc. and Bart Greenhut. The complaint alleges the following
causes of action: (1) breach of lease; (2) common counts; (3) breach of written
guaranty; and (4) ejectment. 
            On August 12, 2021, Bart filed a
cross-complaint against Plaintiff for negligence and unfair business practices
arising from Plaintiff’s allegedly improper rent demands and rent increases. 
            Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the
action after Defendant vacated the premises. Defendants then moved for
attorneys’ fees as the prevailing party. The Court granted Defendants’ motion
on June 20, 2022. Plaintiff appealed. In a decision dated November 13, 2023,
the Court of Appeal reversed, finding that Defendant was not a “prevailing
party” as defined in the parties’ lease agreement. The Court of Appeal awarded
Plaintiff its costs on appeal.
            On March 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion to recover attorneys’ fees associated with the appeal.
Defendant filed a late opposition on April 9, 2024. 
LEGAL STANDARD
“Except as attorney’s fees are
specifically provided for by statute, the measure and mode of compensation of
attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement, express or implied,
of the parties . . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1021.) “Attorney's fees may . . .
be awarded as costs under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021, when authorized
by contract. The attorney's fees clause in a contract may be broad enough to
cover tort as well as contract causes of action.” (Hasler v. Howard
(2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1168, 1171.) 
The lodestar method for calculating
attorney fees applies to any statutory attorney fees award, unless the statute
authorizing the award provides for another method of calculation. (Glaviano
v. Sacramento City Unified School Dist. (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 744,
750-751.) “Under the lodestar method, the trial court must first determine the
lodestar figure—the reasonable hours spent multiplied by the reasonable hourly
rate—based on a careful compilation of the time spent and reasonable hourly
compensation of each attorney involved in the presentation of the case.” (Id.
at p. 751.) The trial court has broad authority to determine the amount of a
reasonable fee. (PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084,
1095.)
DISCUSSION
            Here, the parties’ agreement defines
“prevailing party” as “a Party or Broker who substantially obtains or defeats
the relief sought, as the case may be, whether by compromise, settlement,
judgment, or the abandonment by the other Party or Broker of its claim or
defense.” The Court of Appeal found that Plaintiff succeeded in its ejectment
cause of action when Defendant vacated the premises prior to dismissal. (A
& N Industrial Properties, LLC v. Bart & Judy's Bakery, Inc. (Nov.
13, 2023, No. B322730) 2023 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 6729, at *10.) The Court of
Appeal awarded Plaintiff its costs on appeal. (Id., at *11; see also Evans
v. Unkow (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1490, 1499 [“A statute authorizing an
attorney fee award at the trial court level includes appellate attorney fees
unless the statute specifically provides otherwise”].) Defendant’s belated
opposition entirely ignores the Court of Appeal decision, which is the law of
the case. Defendant does not dispute that Plaintiff prevailed on appeal and was
awarded costs. Therefore, Plaintiff is entitled to its costs on appeal. 
            Plaintiff’s counsel claims an hourly
rate of $500, which the Court finds reasonable. (See Zakari Decl. ¶¶ 4-5.)
Plaintiff’s counsel avers that he spent 41.4 hours on the appeal, which the
Court finds reasonable. (Id., ¶ 6.) Defendant does not challenge the
hourly rate. Defendant purports to challenge the hours but merely concludes
that the time allocated to certain tasks “appears” to be disproportionate.
Defendant provides no real explanation as to how the claimed costs are
unreasonable. Defendant does not dispute that the appeal was complex and
aggressively litigated. The Court finds that Plaintiff reasonably spent 41.4
hours on the appeal.  
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion for attorneys’
fees is GRANTED in the amount of $20,700.
