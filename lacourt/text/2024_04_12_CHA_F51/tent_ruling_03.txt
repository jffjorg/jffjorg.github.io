“Pending review and filing of the Supreme Court's opinion, … a published
opinion of a Court of Appeal in the matter has no binding or precedential effect
and may be cited for potentially persuasive value only.” (Cal. Rules of Ct.,
rule 8.1115(e)(1).) Here, the Court cites to Ochoa as nonbinding
persuasive authority.
