And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the defendants' motions to compel further responses to their special interrogatories. The defendants seek to compel the plaintiffs to disclose their medical information, including the names of their regular physicians and health care providers. The plaintiffs argue that this information is private and not relevant to the case. The judge agrees with the plaintiffs that the defendants' request is overly broad and not reasonably limited to the injuries at issue in the litigation. The judge also finds that the defendants have failed to show that the information sought is directly relevant to the case. As a result, the judge denies the defendants' motions and imposes $200.00 in monetary sanctions against the defendants and/or their counsel.
