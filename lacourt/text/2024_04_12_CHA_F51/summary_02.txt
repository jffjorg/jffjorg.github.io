Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the motion to compel arbitration filed by Defendant Nissan North America, Inc. The motion was filed in response to Plaintiff Jose Sandoval Hernandez's claims under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act and the Federal Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act. The Defendant argued that it had standing to enforce the arbitration provision in the Retail Installment Sales Contract (RISC) between Plaintiff and Nissan of Mission Hills, even though it is not a signatory to the contract. The Defendant relied on the doctrine of equitable estoppel, arguing that it had a direct benefit under the contract and was entitled to enforce the arbitration provision.

The judge concluded that the Defendant did not have standing to enforce the arbitration provision, citing the California Court of Appeal's decision in Ochoa v. Ford Motor Company (2023). The judge noted that the Ochoa court held that a nonsignatory manufacturer does not have the right to compel arbitration of a plaintiff's claims, and that the doctrine of equitable estoppel does not apply in this case.

The judge also noted that the Defendant's reliance on Felisilda v. FCA US LLC (2020) was misplaced, as that case involved a different set of facts and did not apply to the present case. The judge concluded that the Defendant did not have the right to compel arbitration of Plaintiff's claims and denied the motion.
