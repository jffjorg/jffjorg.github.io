And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The court has granted both motions for summary adjudication filed by WBCMT and G & E, seeking indemnity from Prime. The court found that Prime, as the general contractor, had a contractual obligation to indemnify WBCMT and G & E for any damages or injuries resulting from the construction project. The court also found that WBCMT and G & E did not participate in the creation of a dangerous condition that led to the accident, and therefore, they were not actively negligent. The court's decision is based on the language of the agreement between Prime and WBCMT, as well as the court's interpretation of California law.
