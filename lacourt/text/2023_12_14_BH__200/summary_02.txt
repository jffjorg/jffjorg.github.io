And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses several issues related to a future court hearing. The ruling focuses on the responsibilities of the parties involved, specifically Prime as the contractor, G & E as the moving parties, and WBCMT as the construction manager.

The Court notes that the Contract Documents, specifically sections 1.1.2, 10.1, and 4.2.5, clarify the roles and responsibilities of the parties involved. The Contract Documents state that the Construction Manager is responsible for facilitating the performance of their duties, but not for direct control over or charge of the acts or omissions of the contractors or subcontractors.

The Court also considers the agreement between the parties, specifically Article 3 and Article 4, which pertain to the Contractor and the Architect and Construction Manager, respectively. The Court finds that Section 3.3.1 of the agreement is the key provision related to the safety issue at hand.

The Judge rejects Prime's argument that it would have been reasonably possible for WBCMT or G & E to have closed the shopping center during the project, citing the potential liability to tenants for early lease termination and lost business. The Court also finds that Prime's argument that Moving Parties should not have allowed demolition when the stores were open may not apply in this instance.

The Court notes that Hill, a representative of G & E, described her role as "tenant advocate" but this does not mean that G & E was taking over any safety responsibilities. The Court finds that Hill's testimony concerning issues of timing of the demolition to ensure it did not interfere with the tenants' business is insufficient to indicate the parties varied from the terms of the agreement.

Overall, the Judge's tentative ruling clarifies the roles and responsibilities of the parties involved, specifically the Contractor and the Construction Manager, and rejects Prime's arguments related to the safety issue at hand.
