And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the Plaintiffs' three discovery motions against Defendant Liu without prejudice. The motions were to compel Defendant Liu to respond to Form Interrogatories, Requests for Production, and Requests for Admission. The judge ruled that service of the motions was not proper because Defendant Liu, who is self-represented, did not consent to electronic service. Additionally, the judge found that service of the motions was not timely because it was made after the deadline for mail service. The judge ordered Plaintiffs to give notice of the ruling.
