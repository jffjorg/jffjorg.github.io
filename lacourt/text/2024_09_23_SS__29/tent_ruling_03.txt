20STCV27304
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Defendant Lui to Respond to Form Interrogatories
(Set One) Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Defendant Lui to Respond to Requests for
Production (Set One)
Plaintiffs’ Motion for Order Deeming Defendant Lui to Have Admitted the Truth
of Matters Specified in Requests for Admission (Set One)
Tentative
The motions are denied without prejudice.
Background
The Plaintiffs in this action are Wenro
Tupas, Sr., both individually and as successors in interest to Felicidita Tandug
Tupas; Felros Tupas Lim, both individually and as successor in interest to Felicidita
Tandug Tupas; Wenefredo Villacorta Lim; Mary Jane Tupas Gonzales, as successor
in interest to Felicidita Tandug Tupas; Rowne Tandug Tupas, as successor in
interest to Felicidita Tandug Tupas; and Wenro Tandug Tupas, Jr. as successor
in interest to Felicidita Tandug Tupas (collectively “Plaintiffs”).
On July 21, 2020, Plaintiffs filed a
complaint against Toyota Motor Corporation; Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc.;
Toyota Motor North America, Inc.; Toyota Motor Engineering & Manufacturing
North America, Inc.; Seidner-Miller, Inc dba Toyota of Glendora; Liang Liu; and
Does 1 through 100.  In the complaint, Plaintiffs
assert causes of action for strict liability and negligence arising out of an
automobile accident occurring on July 22, 2018.
On July 13, 2023, Defendant Liang Liu (“Liu”)
filed an answer. 
On May 10, 2024, the Court, at the request of
Plaintiffs, dismissed all causes of action against all of the other named defendants
with prejudice.
On June 21, 2024, counsel for Liu was
relieved as attorney of record.  Since
that time, Liu has been self-represented as a pro per litigant.
On August 26, 2024, Plaintiffs filed these three
discovery motions: a motion to compel Liu to respond to Form Interrogatories (Set
One); a motion to compel Liu to respond to Requests for Production (Set One);
and a motion for an order deeming Liu to have admitted the truth of the matters
specified in Requests for Admission (Set One). 
No opposition has been filed.
Legal
Standard
A party must
respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd.
(b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no
meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition,
a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
A party must
respond to requests for production of documents within 30 days after service.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for
production of documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the
requesting party may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (Id.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., §
2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party “may move for an
order that … the truth of [the] matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for such a motion, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id.,
§ 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct.
(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
Discussion
Plaintiffs have filed three discovery motions
against Defendant Liu.  There are service
issues, however, on all three motions.
First, as to the motion regarding the requests
for admission, the attached proof of service states that Liu was served with
the motion electronically.
Although email service may be mandatory for
represented parties, litigants who are in pro per are not subject to mandatory
email service, and Defendant has presented no evidence that Plaintiff has
consented to email service.  (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 1010.6, subd. (c)(2); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.251(c)(3)(B).)
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6, subdivision(c),
an unrepresented party may consent to electronic service by “[s]erving a notice
on all parties and filing the notice with the court” or “[m]anifesting
affirmative consent through electronic means with the court or the court’s
electronic filing service provider, and concurrently providing the party’s
electronic address with that consent for the purpose of receiving electronic
service. The act of electronic filing shall not be construed as express
consent.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1010.6, subd. (c)(3).) 
 
There is nothing filed with the Court showing
in pro per Liu has consented to electronic service. Therefore, service of the
motion for a deemed-admitted order is not proper.
Second, as to the motions to compel, the
attached proofs of service state that they were served by mail on August 26,
2024.  Service by mail is proper, but it
is not timely.  Service of a motion must
be made sixteen court days prior to the hearing, plus five additional calendar days
for mail service.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
1005, subd. (b).)  For a hearing on
September 23, the deadline for personal service (sixteen court days earlier)
was on August 29; the deadline for mail service (five additional calendar days)
was on August 24.
Therefore, service of the motions to compel is
not timely. 
Accordingly, the motions are DENIED without
prejudice.
Conclusion
The Court DENIES
the motions without prejudice
Moving party is ORDERED to give notice.
