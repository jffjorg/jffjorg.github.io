And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion of Justin Rabi, Esq. (Counsel) to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Brian Lee without prejudice. The reason for the denial is that no proof of service showing service on all parties and on Plaintiff appears in the file. Additionally, the declaration and proposed order do not include all future hearings, including an OSC re dismissal set for November 19, 2024. The judge notes that the court may delay the effective date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has been filed with the court.
