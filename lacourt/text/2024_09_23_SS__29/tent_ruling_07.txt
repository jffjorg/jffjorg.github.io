22STCV36940
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff filed
by Justin Rabi, Esq.
Tentative
The motion is denied without prejudice.
Background
On November 22, 2022, Brian Lee (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against TenTen Wilshire, LLC (TenTen”), Brandon Chabner (“Chabner”),
and Does 1 through 50 for general negligence and premises liability arising out
of an incident that occurred on November 24, 2020.
On January 20, 2023, Chabner filed an answer.

On February 24, 2023, TenTen filed an answer
and cross-complaint against Chabner. Chabner filed an answer to the
cross-complaint on October 24, 2023. 
The Court, at the request of Plaintiff,
dismissed all causes of action in the complaint against Chabner on April 15, 2024.  The Court, as the request of TenTen,
dismissed all causes of action in the cross-complaint against Chabner on July
3, 2024.
On August 26, 2024, Justin Rabi, Esq.
(“Counsel”) filed this motion to be relieved as attorney of record for
Plaintiff; no opposition has been filed.
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
Counsel has
filed the Notice, Declaration of Order to be Relieved as Counsel.  The Court, however, must deny the motion without
prejudice, as no proof of service showing service on all parties and on
Plaintiff appears in the file.
The Court also
notes that the declaration and the proposed order do not include all future
hearings (the OSC re dismissal set for November 19, 2024 has been omitted).
Conclusion
The motion to be
relieved as counsel is DENIED without prejudice.
