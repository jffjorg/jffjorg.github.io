And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel the inspection of the defendant's premises. The plaintiff had requested an inspection of the premises where the incident occurred, but the defendant did not respond. The plaintiff then sent an email stating that the inspection was "off calendar", which the judge interpreted as reasonable grounds for the defendant to believe that the demand for inspection had been withdrawn. As a result, no response was required from the defendant. The judge also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions against the defendant. The judge ruled that the plaintiff's motion was procedurally flawed and that the conditions for compelling an inspection under California Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.320 were not satisfied. The judge noted that the plaintiff may still propound a new demand for inspection and seek appropriate relief if necessary.
