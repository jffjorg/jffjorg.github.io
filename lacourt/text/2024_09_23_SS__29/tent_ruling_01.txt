20STCV16335
Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment
 
TENTATIVE
 
The Motion for Summary Judgment filed by LAUSD
is GRANTED.
 
Plaintiff is granted leave to amend.
 
Background
 
On April 29, 2020, Solomon Barnes
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Los Angeles Unified School District
(“LAUSD”), Foshay Learning Center, Javier Bran (“Bran”), and Does 1 through 100.  
 
Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint
(“FAC”) against LAUSD, Bran, and the Doe defendants on May 18, 2021. In the
FAC, Plaintiff asserts causes of action for negligence and negligent
supervision arising out of an incident in which Plaintiff injured his lower
back while carrying a heavy box of supplies from a field trip. (FAC, ¶ 6.) 
 
LAUSD and Bran (collectively, “Defendants”)
filed their answer on June 25, 2021.
 
On April 23, 2024, Defendants filed this motion
for summary judgment. Plaintiff filed an opposition on September 9, and Defendants
filed their reply on September 17.
 
Evidentiary
Objections
 
Defendants
assert eight objections. 
 
In light
of the Court’s reasoning below, the Court need not, and does not, rule on the objections.
 
Legal
Standard
 
“The purpose
of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut
through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their
allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil
Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), “requires the trial judge to grant
summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably
deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or
evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of
the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the
issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether
there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.”
(Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI
Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 381-382.)
 
As to each
cause of action as framed by the complaint, a defendant moving for summary
judgment or summary adjudication must satisfy the initial burden of proof by
presenting facts to show “that one or more elements of the cause of action ...
cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of
action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra,
25 Cal.4th at pp. 850-851; Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Once the defendant has met that burden, the burden
shifts to the plaintiff to show that a “triable issue of one or more material
facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp.
850-851.)
 
A plaintiff or
cross-complainant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication must
satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to show “that there is
no defense to a cause of action if that party has proved each element of the
cause of action entitling the party to judgment on the cause of action.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) Once the plaintiff or cross-complainant has
met that burden, the burden shift to the defendant or cross-defendant to show
that a “triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of
action or a defense thereto.” (Ibid.)
 
The party
opposing a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication may not simply
“rely upon the allegations or denials of its pleadings” but must instead “set
forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subds. (p)(1) & (p)(2). To establish a triable
issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial
responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151,
166.)
 
Courts
“liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary
judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore
v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
 
Discussion
 
In the
FAC, Plaintiff alleges that he was injured “[w]hen returning from a field trip
sanctioned by the school.” (FAC, ¶ 6.) 
 
Education
Code section 35330 provides school districts and their employees with what is
sometimes called “field trip immunity”:
 
“All persons making the field trip or
excursion shall be deemed to have waived all claims against the district, a
charter school, or the State of California for injury, accident, illness, or
death occurring during or by reason of the field trip or excursion. All adults
taking out-of-state field trips or excursions and all parents or guardians of
pupils taking out-of-state field trips or excursions shall sign a statement
waiving all claims.” 
 
(Education Code, § 35330(d).) 
 
“The
immunity granted by section 35330, subdivision (d), applies to “the district.”
(Sanchez v. San Diego County Office of Education (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th
1580, 1584.) It also covers
school district employees. (Casterson
v. Superior Court (2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 177, 189.)
 
“The
courts have construed the “deemed to have waived” language contained in section
35330, subdivision (d), as creating a “broad immunity.” (Sanchez, supra, 182
Cal.App.4th at p. 1584 citing Wolfe v. Dublin Unified School Dist.
(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 126, 130, 65 Cal.Rptr.2d 280; accord Casterson,
supra, 101 Cal.App.4th at p. 180.)
 
Defendants
move for summary judgment alleging Plaintiff’s claim is barred by Education
Code section 35330. Defendants
argue that the allegations in the FAC, and particularly paragraph 6, are
judicial admissions that Plaintiff was injured “during” or “by reason of” a
field trip.
 
Reviewing
Plaintiff’s FAC, he alleges:
 
When returning from a field trip sanctioned
by the school, BRAN asked Plaintiff to carry a box from the bus to the bungalow
which included a set of stairs. The distance from the bus to the bungalow was
approximately 300 yards and the box was 24” x 24” filled with heavy supplies.
The box could not be held by the bottom so Plaintiff was forced to hold it in a
“hug” sort of fashion. Plaintiff immediately felt lower back pain as he brought
the box to the bungalow at the request of BRAN. BRAN failed to acknowledgment
Plaintiff is special needs and therefore is unable to advocate for himself.
 
(FAC,
¶ 6.)
 
The
Court finds the causes of action in the FAC, as pleaded, are within the scope
of the immunity provided by Education Code section 35330. The motion for
summary judgment is granted.
 
Where,
as here, a summary judgment motion is based on a challenge to the pleadings
(serving essentially as a motion for judgment on the pleadings), and the motion
“is granted on the ground that the complaint is legally insufficient, but it
appears from the materials submitted in opposition to the motion that the
plaintiff could state a cause of action, the trial court should give the
plaintiff an opportunity to amend the complaint before entry of judgment.” (Bostrom
v. County of San Bernardino (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1654, 1663.)
 
Plaintiff
has presented sufficient information to show that there is a reasonable
possibility that he could amend his pleading to state a cause of action. (See Bass
Decl., ¶¶ 7, 8; Bran Depo., at 32:14-25.) 
 
Accordingly,
the Court grants Plaintiff leave to amend before judgment is entered.
 
Conclusion
 
The
Court GRANTS Defendants’ motion for summary judgment.
 
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff leave to file an amended complaint within 14 days of the
hearing.  
 
If
Plaintiff does not file an amended complaint within 14 days, Defendants may
then submit a proposed judgment.
 
Moving
Party is to give notice.
