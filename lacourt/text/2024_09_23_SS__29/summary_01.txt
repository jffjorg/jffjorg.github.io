And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment, finding that the plaintiff's claims are barred by Education Code section 35330, which provides immunity to school districts and employees for injuries occurring during or by reason of a field trip. The plaintiff alleges that he was injured while carrying a heavy box of supplies from a field trip, but the court finds that his claims are within the scope of the immunity provided by the code section. The judge has also granted the plaintiff leave to amend his complaint within 14 days of the hearing. If the plaintiff does not file an amended complaint within the time allowed, the defendant may then submit a proposed judgment.
