And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendants' motion to continue the trial. The motion is based on the death of Kenton E. Moore, the lead trial counsel, who passed away on August 11, 2024. The judge finds that the defendants have established good cause for a continuance under California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c)(4), as the substitution of new counsel, Dominic A. Quiller, is in the interest of justice. The judge notes that the plaintiff has not filed an opposition to the motion. The defendants are seeking a six-month continuance, which the judge finds is reasonable given the circumstances. The trial is continued from November 18, 2024 to a date in mid-May 2025, and the final status conference and all deadlines are reset based on the new trial date.
