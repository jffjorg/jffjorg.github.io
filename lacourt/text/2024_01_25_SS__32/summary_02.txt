Summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to continue trial and related dates filed by Defendants Justin Valdez and Honeywell International Inc. The motion is unopposed. The Defendants argue that they require additional time to complete discovery due to the unavailability of Plaintiffs Ramon Flores and Consuelo Flores for medical examinations. The Court finds that the Defendants have a reasonable excuse for failing to conduct necessary discovery and grants the motion to continue trial. The trial date is continued from February 20, 2024 to May 7, 2024, and the Final Status Conference is rescheduled from February 5, 2024 to April 23, 2024.
