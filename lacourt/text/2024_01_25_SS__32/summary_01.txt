And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions: one for leave to file a first amended answer and another to continue trial and reopen discovery. The judge granted the motion for leave to file a first amended answer, allowing Defendants to amend their answer to include affirmative defenses surrounding a settlement agreement. However, the judge denied the motion to reopen discovery, finding that it was not necessary and would not prevent the case from going to trial on the scheduled date.

The judge's decision was based on the fact that the Defendants had already had multiple opportunities to conduct discovery and that their delay in seeking to reopen discovery was not justified. The judge also noted that the settlement agreement was not valid and enforceable, and that the Defendants' affirmative defenses were not meritorious.

The judge's ruling is tentative and is subject to change based on any submissions or appearances made by the parties at the hearing.
