Motion
  to Quash Subpoenas

Plaintiff

OPPOSING PARTY:


Defendants
  Paige Borenstein and Tina Borenstein



 
BACKGROUND
 
On October 3, 2022, Plaintiffs Patricia Mattar and Alexander Mattar filed
a complaint against Defendants Paige Borenstein and Tina Borenstein
(“Defendants”) for injuries related to a motor vehicle accident. 
 
Plaintiff Alexander Mattar (“Plaintiff”) now moves to quash thirteen
subpoenas issued by Defendants and directed to Plaintiff’s individual medical providers
and pharmacy. Plaintiff also seeks monetary sanctions. Defendants oppose and
Plaintiff replies. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Code of Civil Procedure § 1987.1(a) states: 
 
If a subpoena requires the attendance of a witness or the production
of books, documents, electronically stored information, or other things before
a court, or at the trial of an issue therein, or at the taking of a deposition,
the court, upon motion reasonably made by any person described in subdivision
(b), or upon the court's own motion after giving counsel notice and an
opportunity to be heard, may make an order quashing the subpoena entirely,
modifying it, or directing compliance with it upon those terms or conditions as
the court shall declare, including protective orders. In addition, the court
may make any other order as may be appropriate to protect the person from
unreasonable or oppressive demands, including unreasonable violations of the
right of privacy of the person. 
 
“The state Constitution expressly grants Californians a right of
privacy. (Cal. Const., art. I, § 1.) Protection of informational privacy is the
provision's central concern. [Citation omitted.] In Hill, [the
California Supreme Court] established a framework for evaluating potential
invasions of privacy. The party asserting a privacy right must establish a
legally protected privacy interest, an objectively reasonable expectation of
privacy in the given circumstances, and a threatened intrusion that is serious.
[Citation omitted.] The party seeking information may raise in response
whatever legitimate and important countervailing interests disclosure serves,
while the party seeking protection may identify feasible alternatives that
serve the same interests or protective measures that would diminish the loss of
privacy. A court must then balance these competing considerations. [citation
omitted].” (Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 533 (citing
Hill v. National Collegiate Athletic Assn. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1, 35.) 
 
“[Prior] cases correctly recognize that when a discovery request seeks
information implicating the constitutional right of privacy, to order discovery
simply upon a showing that the Code of Civil Procedure section 2017.010 test
for relevance has been met is an abuse of discretion. [Citation omitted.] But
they also stand for the proposition that whenever discovery of facially private
information is sought, the party seeking discovery must demonstrate a “
‘compelling state interest’ ” [citation omitted] or “compelling need” [citation
omitted]. Although in this they are not alone [citation omitted], they
nevertheless are incorrect.” (Williams, supra, 3 Cal.5th at 556.) “To
the extent prior cases require a party seeking discovery of private information
to always establish a compelling interest or compelling need, without regard to
the other considerations articulated in Hill v. National Collegiate Athletic
Assn., [citation omitted], they are disapproved.” (Id. at 557.)
 
“Only obvious invasions of interest fundamental to personal autonomy
must be supported by a compelling interest.” (Williams, supra, 3 Cal.5th
at 556.) When lesser interests are at stake, “the strength of the
countervailing interest sufficient to warrant disclosure of private information
var[ies] according to the strength of the privacy interest itself, the
seriousness of the invasion, and the availability of alternatives and
protective measures.” (Id.) “The trial courts in exercising their
discretion should keep in mind that the Legislature has suggested that, where
possible, the court should impose partial limitations rather than outright
denial of discovery.” (Id. at 559 [quotation omitted].)
 
California Code of Civil Procedure section 1987.2 provides that “the
court may in its discretion award the amount of reasonable expenses incurred in
making or opposing [a motion to quash], including reasonable attorney’s fees,
if the court finds the motion was made or opposed in bad faith or without
substantial justification or that one or more of the requirements of the
subpoena was oppressive.” (Code Civ. Proc. section 1987.2(a).)
 
“Unless
otherwise limited by order of the court in accordance with this title, any
party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is
relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action or to the
determination of any motion made in that action, if the matter either is itself
admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2017.010.) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendants contend that liability is not disputed in this case. At
issue are causation, the nature and extent of injuries, and the reasonableness
of Plaintiff’s medical treatment. (Opp., 3.) 
 
The subpoenas at issue request Plaintiff’s records from the past ten
years including, “but not limited to examinations, medical history, diagnosis,
treatment, testing, radiology, prognosis, prescriptions, and billing.” The
subpoenas exclude “documents dealing with psychology and mental issues;
reproductive system; and sexually transmitted diseases.” The subpoenas also
seek a “breakdown of any and all x-ray films and/or MRI films taken.”
 
The last subpoena seeks Plaintiff’s pharmacy records from Walgreens
Pharmacy for the past ten years. 
 
Plaintiff argues that the thirteen subpoenas are overbroad in time and
scope because they seek medical records from the past ten years and are not
limited to the injuries Plaintiff is claiming: (1) low back/lumbar spine; and
(2) neck/cervical spine. (Motion, 3–4.) Plaintiff states he will waive his knee
injury claim. (Id.) 
 
Defendants argue they are entitled to the records to determine whether
Plaintiff’s injuries were pre-existing. (Opp., 4.) However, Defendant fails to
set forth additional circumstances that would require medical records for the
past ten years. The Court finds that five years is a reasonable time for
Defendants to discover whether Plaintiff’s injuries were pre-existing before
the incident. 
 
Next, Plaintiff argues the subpoenas infringe on his right to privacy.
A party’s
medical records are privileged under the patient-physician privilege. (See Hale
v. Superior Court (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 1421, 1424.)¿ “Discovery of
constitutionally protected information is on a par with discovery of privileged information.”¿
(Tylo v. Superior Court (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1387.)¿ Where the
party filing an action has arguably waived the privacy in their protected or privileged information by
filing a lawsuit, the waiver must be narrowly construed such that discovery is
only permitted of those matters directly relevant to the party’s claims. (Britt
v. Superior Court (1978) 20 Cal.3d 844, 858-859.)¿ Notwithstanding, the
party still has privacy rights as to physical and mental conditions unrelated
to the claimed injury.¿ (See id. at 864; Heller v. Norcal Mutual
Insurance Co. (1994) 8
Cal.4th 30, 44.)¿¿ 
 
Defendants
appear to argue that the court in Britt never stated that discovery was
limited to certain body parts. Therefore, Defendants argue, because Plaintiff
has put his general medical condition at issue, they are entitled to any
records regarding his medical condition. (Opp., 6.)  However, the medical conditions claimed by
Plaintiff in this case are specifically limited to certain areas of the body.
Additionally, to allow records about any medical condition where only certain
areas of the body are injured would frustrate the privacy right surrounding a
party’s medical records. It would also run contrary to the assertion in Britt
that a party has a privacy right to physical and mental conditions unrelated to
the injury. Additionally, Plaintiff has shown that the medical records at issue
are protected by a right of privacy, and that there is a reasonable expectation
of privacy and serious threatened intrusion since they may uncover conditions
not related to Plaintiff’s injuries in the low back/lumbar spine
and neck/cervical spine. Therefore, weighing the interest in disclosure against the feasible
alternatives, the Court finds that Defendants’ subpoenas must be limited to records
for the past five years regarding Plaintiff’s back, neck, and spine only. 
 
Regarding
the pharmacy subpoena to Walgreens, there is no limit to prescriptions related
to Plaintiff’s injuries at issue in this case. The subpoenas also seek records
for the past ten years. Patients retain a reasonable expectation of privacy in
prescription records. (County of Los Angeles v. Superior Court¿(2021) 65
Cal.App.5th 621, 643.) Here, because the records seek all prescriptions used by
Plaintiff for the past ten years, it is overbroad. The subpoenas must be
limited to the injuries at issue in this case and be limited to the past five
years.  Therefore, the motion to quash the pharmacy subpoena is also
granted. 
 
The Court finds this motion
was not made in bad faith and declines to award sanctions to either party.
 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to quash subpoenas. 
 
Plaintiff to provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
