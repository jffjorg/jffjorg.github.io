And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses several issues regarding the plaintiff's motion and the defendant's objections. The judge notes that the plaintiff's complaint is boilerplate and that reliance on jurisdictions outside of Los Angeles County will be disregarded. Additionally, the judge will disregard unpublished opinions relied upon by the plaintiff.

The judge also addresses the issue of the hourly rate for the services provided and finds that $350 is a fairer value than the original proposed rate of $250-$300 per hour. The judge rejects the plaintiff's argument that a multiplier is warranted based on the risks posed by litigation, as many lemon law cases settle or result in judgments in favor of the plaintiff.

The judge also notes that the plaintiff's statement that a discovery motion was fully briefed and heard by the court is inaccurate, as this court did not hear any discovery motions on this case. Finally, the judge rejects the plaintiff's request for a multiplier based on the risks posed by litigation and awards the defendant's offer of $20,000.
