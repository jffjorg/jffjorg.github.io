[1] The complaint is boilerplate and 8 pages. 


[2] To the extent that Plaintiff relies upon numerous jurisdictions
outside of Los Angeles County, they will be disregarded. (See e.g.,
Jiang Decl., p. 6 of 780 of PDF [citing to Orange County and San Bernardino
cases). Additionally, to the extent that Plaintiff heavily relies upon unpublished
(thus non-citable) opinions, those too will be disregarded. To the
extent that this addresses Defendant’s objections regarding case citations,
Defendant’s objections are SUSTAINED. 
 


[3] On this note, it is unclear why Plaintiff has
provided hundreds of pages on national data regarded to consumer law
when the inquiry is community-based (i.e., local). 
 


[4] The court was going to award less (between
$250-$300/hour), but Defendant’s opposition presents $350 as a fairer value. (See
Opp. p. 15, citing to Mikhaeilpoor v. BMW of North America, LLC (2020)
48 Cal.App.5th 240, 245 [reasonable hourly rate for the services that were done
in a lemon law action was $350.00].) To the extent that Plaintiff contends its
hourly rate(s) are reasonable because another case determined $575/hour was
reasonable, that is a San Diego case which is not the community of Los
Angeles. (See Motion p. 8, citing Goglin v. BMW of North America, LLC (2016)
Cal.App.5th 462.) The county aside, in Goglin, the trial court also
determined $575/hour was reasonable based upon “observ[ing] counsel's lawyering skills firsthand.” (Id. at
p. 474.) Here, however, as there have been no substantive motions in the docket
that require advocacy, this court has not witnessed certain lawyering skills. Furthermore,
even assuming taking California as a whole, Plaintiff’s own submitted evidence
provides that the 25% median attorney rate for all attorneys practicing
consumer law in California is $350. (See Jiang Decl, p. 206 of 780 of PDF
[‘United States Consumer Law Survey Report 2017-2018.’].) 
 


[5] Plaintiff’s Motion states that it made a discovery
motion. (See e.g., Motion p. 5:26-27 [“Plaintiff’s discovery motion was fully
briefed and heard by the Court”]; see also p. 13:25-27].) However, as noted
by Defendant in opposition (Opp. p. 14:1-5), that is inaccurate because this
court did not hear any discovery motions on this case.
 


[6] For a similar
reason, Plaintiff’s argument that a multiplier is warranted because the risks
posed by the litigation is unpersuasive considering many of the lemon law cases
settle or render judgment in favor of Plaintiff. 
 


[7] Defendant initially offered $15,000 and subsequently
$20,000. (Motion p. 5.)
