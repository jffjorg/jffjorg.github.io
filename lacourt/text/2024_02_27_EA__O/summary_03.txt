Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has sustained defendant General Motors LLC's demurrer to the plaintiff's fourth cause of action (COA) for fraud, fraudulent inducement, and concealment, without granting leave to amend. This means that the plaintiff's request for punitive damages is struck. The judge has also granted defendant's motion to strike punitive damages, without granting leave to amend. The court's decision is based on the plaintiff's failure to plead sufficient facts to support the fraud COA, despite the court's previous ruling sustaining defendant's demurrer with leave to amend.
