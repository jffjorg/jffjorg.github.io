Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's motion for attorneys' fees and costs, but reduces the amount to $21,547.00. The judge found that the Plaintiff's counsel billed excessive hours, and reduced the billable hours to those presented by the Defendant. The judge also reduced the hourly rate for the attorneys to $350/hour. The judge declined to award a multiplier, finding that the case did not present any complex or novel issues, and did not require extraordinary legal skill.
