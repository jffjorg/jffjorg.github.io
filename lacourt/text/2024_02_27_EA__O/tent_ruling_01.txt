  Case Number:  22PSCV00949    Hearing Date:   February 27, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND
COSTS is GRANTED, but in the reduced amount of $21,547.00 for attorney fees. [Should Defendant not take issue with the
amended Memorandum of Costs, the court will add the cost of $1,665.13 for a
total award of $23,202.13.]
 
Background
 
This is a lemon law case arising from Plaintiff Paul G.
Mark’s lease of a 2020 Maserati Ghibli which encountered various defects
including, but not limited to a defective engine, defective electrical system,
and defective connectivity system.
 
On August 30, 2022, Plaintiff filed suit against
Defendant for Violations Of Statutory Obligations (Song- Beverly Consumer
Warranty Act Ca Civil Code §§ 1790-1795.8).[1]
 
On September 30, 2022, Defendant filed its answer. 
 
On January 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion. 
 
On February 13, 2024, Defendant filed its opposition. 
 
On February 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed its reply (and a
new/amended memorandum of costs).
 
Legal Standard
 
Plaintiff brings forth the
motion pursuant to Civil Code section 1794 subdivision (d). 
 
In turn, the statute
provides the following:
 
If the buyer prevails in an
action under this section, the buyer shall be allowed by the court to recover
as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and
expenses, including attorney’s fees based on actual time expended, determined
by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection
with the commencement and prosecution of such action. (Civ. Code §1794(d)
(emphasis added).) 
 
As for
determining the “reasonableness” of attorney costs incurred in fee shifting
cases, the inquiry in California ordinarily begins with the “lodestar” method
which embraces a two-step method. (See also Motion p. 7.)
 
The first
step requires a trial court to multiply the time reasonably spent by Plaintiff
counsel on the case by a reasonable hourly rate. A computation of time spent on a
case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a determination of
an appropriate attorneys’ fee award. 
 
The second step allows a trial court
to adjust or enhance the lodestar by applying a multiplier to consider the
contingent nature and risk associated with the action, as well as other
factors, such as degree of skill required, ultimate success achieved, and
“extraordinary legal skill.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1130, 1132, 1137; see
also Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49
(Serrano III) [identifies seven factors that a trial court properly
considers in its decision to augment the lodestar calculation].) The factors considered in determining the modification of
the lodestar include the nature and difficulty of the litigation,
the amount of money involved, the skill required and employed to
handle the case, the attention given, the success or failure, and
other circumstances in the case. (EnPalm, LLC v. Teitler
Family Trust (2008) 162 Cal. App. 4th 770, 774, emphasis added and underline
added).) A negative
modifier was appropriate when duplicative work had been performed. (Thayer
v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 819.) The amount
of the multiplier lies within the court’s sound discretion. (Ketchum,
supra, 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1138 [“To the
extent a trial court is concerned that a particular award is excessive, it has
broad discretion to adjust the fee downward or deny an unreasonable fee
altogether.”], see also Motion p. 8:11-12.)
 
After the
trial court has performed the lodestar calculations, it shall consider whether
the total award so calculated under all
of the circumstances of the case is more than a reasonable amount and, if
so, shall reduce the award so that it is a reasonable figure.  (PLCM
Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095-96.) 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff moves the court to issue an
Order awarding Plaintiff attorneys’ fees and costs in the amount of (1)
$37,711.30; (2) a multiplier in the amount of $37,711.30; and (3) an additional
$5,000 for Plaintiff’s counsel to review Defendant’s Opposition, draft the
Reply brief, and attend the hearing on this Motion. Accordingly,
Plaintiff requests a total award of $80,422.60 in attorneys’ fees (which
includes the requested multiplier). 
 
Defendant takes issue with the number
of hours Plaintiff’s Counsel devoted to the litigation, the reasonableness of
the hourly fee, and the justification of a multiplier. 
 
For all the reasons to be more
specifically discussed below, the court agrees with Defendant on all points. 
 
A.   
Step #1: Hours x Rate 
 
i.                
Billable Hours are Unreasonable 
 
According to the appellate court in Horsford
v. Board of Trustees of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th
359, as cited in Plaintiff’s Motion, attorney
fees are meant to “fully compensate counsel for . . . services reasonably
provided to his or her client.” (Id. at p. 395.) “The basis for
the trial court's calculation must be the actual hours counsel has devoted to
the case.” (Ibid, emphasis added.) In assessing the actual hours spent,
when counsel presents verified time records, there is a “presumption of
credibility” such that the time records are “entitled to credence in the
absence of a clear indication the records are erroneous.” (Id. at p.
396.) That said, while a
trial court abuses its discretion in “rejecting wholesale counsels’ verified
time records,” (ibid) it may deny compensation for “inefficient or duplicative”
work. (Id. at p. 394, quoting Ketchum, supra, 24 Cal.4th
at p. 1132, emphasis added.)
 
Plaintiff’s fee recovery is based on
91.32 hours spent by his attorney’s firm litigating this case. (Motion p. 10,
citing Jiang Decl., Ex. 17.) 
 
Here,
despite Plaintiff’s contention that the litigation involved a “sheer amount of
detail” (Reply p. 7:12-14), the billing records indicate otherwise. Instead,
the records illustrate inefficient work, duplicative work, and “vague”
entries as they are largely dedicated to routine tasks, excessive
interoffice communications, and administrative tasks. (See also Opp. pp.
12-14.) For example, see
the following entries:
 
-       
Vague
or duplicative entries for “reviewing” costs and expenses (see e.g., 12/16/23
and 11/22/23). 
-       
Duplicative/inefficient
billing regarding a tracking number for a check (11/14/23 and 11/09/23 billing
entries). 
-       
Duplicative,
vague, and inefficient entries for “review[ing] emails from defendant re.
status on overage payments” (see e.g., 10/02/23, 10/03/23, 10/12/23, 10/23/23,
9/27/23, 9/15/23, 9/07, 23). 
-       
Plaintiff’s
attorneys billed 11.75 hours (totaling $4,910.25) for multiple entries vaguely
described as “draft [redacted]” “prepare [redacted]” or “calculate [redacted]”
which provides no clarity as to the exact tasks performed. 
-       
Duplicative
entries for emailing Defense Counsel re: vehicle surrender (see e.g., 8/17/23
and 6/28/23).
 
(See generally Jiang Decl., Ex. 17,
starting p. 728 of 780 of PDF.)
 
In sum, there are many emails, calls,
and reviews of the same things, about the same things, and to the same people,
impressing upon the court that the
entries are grossly exaggerated. Therefore, Plaintiff’s Counsel's billing
entries demonstrate a lack of efficiency in litigating the case and a lack of
clarity in tasks performed.
 
Therefore, the court reduces the
billable hours to those presented by Defendant in opposition. (Opp. p. 18.) 
 
ii.              
The Hourly Rates are Unreasonable[2]
 
The hourly rates for the attorneys who
worked on this case is Corinna Jiang ($415/hour) and Nancy Zhang ($500/hour);
Counsel Jiang performed most of the work with 76.22 hours of work. Plaintiff
contends (without citation to evidence) that “[t]hese rates are similar to the
rates of Los Angeles County awarded to attorneys in other Song-Beverly cases.”
(Motion p. 9:15-16.) 
 
However, the inquiry is not whether
other attorneys are doing identical work but “comparable legal
services in the community.” (Ketchum, supra, 24 Cal.4th
at p. 1132, italics added.)[3] Accordingly, the work could be done with someone versed in
contract law (i.e., as issues involve breaches of warranties). Additionally, the
mere fact that other Judges have found these hourly rates reasonable is
inapposite as the issue rests in the sound discretion of this court. And even
taking Plaintiff’s citation to Reynolds v. Ford Motor Co. (2020) 47 Cal.App.5th
1105, 1110 (Morion p. 9), that supports a court’s decision to grant hourly rate
of $250/hour, notably when the work can be performed by an associate. 
 
Therefore, the court reduces the hourly rate for the
attorneys to $350/hour.[4]
 
Step #2:
Augmenting Lodestar With a Multiplier 
 
Plaintiffs
seek a Lodestar multiplier enhancement of 2.0. (Motion p. 12.) 
 
Here, the
court finds no reason to award a multiplier considering that: 
 
1.     the billing
records show no substantive work/motions
2.     discovery was
conducted informally due to the routine nature of these cases,[5]
3.     allegations
were boilerplate.
 
To the extent
that Plaintiff argues a multiplier is warranted because counsel “tenaciously”
litigated the case (Motion p. 14:20-21), that is but a mandatory, ethical
obligation of an attorney. (See Rule 1.3 [Diligence] “A lawyer shall . . . act with
reasonable diligence in representing a client.”]; see also generally California
Model Rules of Professional Conduct Rules 1.1-1.18 [a lawyer shall be
diligent].) 
 
To the extent
that Plaintiff argues a multiplier is warranted because Counsel obtained an
excellent outcome (Motion p. 12), not so. “The ‘results obtained’ factor can
properly be used to enhance a lodestar calculation where an exceptional effort
produced an exceptional benefit.” (Thayer, supra, 92 Cal.App.4th at p.
838.) The ‘results obtained’ factor is incorporated into the ‘quality’ factor:
“i.e., high-quality work may produce greater results in less time than would
work of average quality, thus justifying a multiplier.” (Ibid.)
Here, however, Defendant did not file a substantive motion (i.e., demurrer,
motion for judgment on the pleadings, summary judgment) to dispute Plaintiff’s
factual or legal claims, suggesting the results obtained were the predicted
results.[6] To the extent that
Plaintiff relies upon the 7 months it took to settle in principle, both parties
claim the other caused the delay. Who caused it is inapposite; the protracted
negotiations delayed execution of the settlement agreement and did not substantial
value to the settlement.[7] (Id. at p. 839.) 
 
To the extent
that Plaintiff argues a multiplier is warranted because of the skill required
in litigating this case, perhaps Defendant summarizes it best: “This case
involved the same law firms, same filings, same issues, and same efforts as
hundreds of other lemon law cases Plaintiff’s counsel’s firm routinely
handles.” (Opp. p. 17:1-3.) Therefore, absent extraordinary advocacy, a
multiplier is not warranted under this factor. 
 
iii.            
Memorandum of Costs
 
In opposition,
Defendant argues that Plaintiff fails to attach any support for any of the
costs incurred and thus, should be stricken in its entirety. (Opp. p. 17.)
Plaintiff, though without addressing the matter in opposition, appear to
concede the point as they file an amended memorandum of costs. 
 
As Defendant has presumably not had a chance to
review the memorandum of costs, the cost is TBD at the hearing. Should
Defendant not object to the $1,655.13 amount, it will be added to the $21,547.00
total. 
 
Conclusion
 
In sum, this
is a garden variety lemon law case that did not present any complex or novel
issues, involved no law and motion, settled early in litigation, and required
no extraordinary legal skill justifying augmentation of the lodestar. With
that, the hourly rate is reduced, the billable hours are reduced, and no
multiplier is awarded yielding total recovery for attorney’s fees of $21,547.00
(subject to increase with costs).
