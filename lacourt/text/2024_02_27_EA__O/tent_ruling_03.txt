Background
 
This is a
lemon law case. Plaintiff alleges that vehicle purchased (a Chevrolet
Silverado) was equipped with a defective Hydra-Matic 8L90 transmission. 
 
On March 30,
2023, Plaintiff HILARIO SALVADOR GARCIA filed suit against Defendant General
Motors LLC (Defendant or GM) for the following causes of action (COA): 1.     Violation Of Song-Beverly Act - Breach
Of Express Warranty 2.     Violation Of Song-Beverly Act - Breach
Of Implied Warranty 3.     Violation Of The Song Beverly Act
Section 1793.2 4.     Fraud – Fraudulent Inducement –
Concealment
 
On May 1,
2023, Defendant filed a demurrer (as to 4th COA) with a motion to
strike (MTS).
 
On July 31,
2023, Plaintiff filed a FAC for the same COAs, which rendered the 5/1/23
demurrer and MTS moot. 
 
On August 30,
2023, Defendant filed a demurrer and MTS to the FAC, which the court on 10/5/23
sustained with leave to amend. 
 
On December
27, 2023, Plaintiff filed its SAC.
 
On January
26, 2024, Defendant filed the instant demurrer x MTS to the SAC.
 
On February
13, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition.
 
On February
20, 2024, Defendant filed its reply. 
 
Discussion 
 
Defendant again
demurs to the 4th COA for Fraud-Fraudulent Inducement-Concealment on
the grounds that it (i) fails to state facts relevant to the elements of the
claim and (ii) fails to allege a transactional relationship giving rise to a
duty to disclose.
 
The court need not reach the specific arguments
raised in the papers as Plaintiff failed to cure the defects noted in the
court’s 10/5/23 ruling. 
 
Previously,
the court took issue with Plaintiff’s 4th COA improperly incorporating
126 allegations and 24 pages worth of allegations. This failure to plead
essential facts inherently tied into Defendants’ basis for demurrer which is
that Plaintiffs fail to plead sufficient facts. Thus, the court gave leave to
amend “to allow for Plaintiff to add the essential allegations to the fraud COA
within the 4th COA.” (See 10/5/23 ruling.) 
 
While
Plaintiff may now not incorporate the relevant allegations by reference, it
again fails to provide the relevant facts to support its 4th
COA. Instead, Plaintiff
provides 18 pages worth of allegations. (See SAC pp. 11-29.) And
despite the court’s note that the only relevant allegations should pertain to
the 8L90 transmission, Plaintiff again interchange between the 8L90 and 8L45
transmissions. What is more, the SAC references other models (e.g., GMC
Sierras, GMC Yukon XLs), meaning that SAC is providing irrelevant allegations. 
 
Therefore, as
Plaintiff has not used pled the relevant facts to support its 4th
COA for fraud, the demurrer is SUSTAINED without leave to amend, which strikes
any request for punitive damages. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, the demurrer as to the 4th COA for fraud/concealment is
sustained without leave to amend and the motion to strike is granted without
leave to amend.
