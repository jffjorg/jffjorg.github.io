And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Fleet Capital, Inc.'s motion for summary judgment in this unlawful detainer action. The case involves a nonjudicial foreclosure sale of a property in Covina, which was purchased by Fleet Capital. The former owner of the property, Gwendolyn Keene, was served with a three-day notice to quit but failed to vacate the property. Fleet Capital has established that it acquired title to the property through a properly conducted foreclosure sale and has perfected its title by recording a trustee's deed.

The judge has found that Fleet Capital has carried its burden of showing that there are no disputed or triable issues of material fact regarding its ownership of the property. Keene failed to provide any evidence or file an opposition to Fleet Capital's motion. Therefore, the judge has granted Fleet Capital's motion for summary judgment and has ordered that Fleet Capital be granted immediate possession of the property.
