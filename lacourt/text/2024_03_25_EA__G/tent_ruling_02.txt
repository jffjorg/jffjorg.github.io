for Default Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Bankers Healthcare Group, LLC’s Application
for Default Judgment is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
This
is a collections action. In September 2020, Pinnacle Bank entered into a loan
agreement with Defendant Gideon H. Gunabe in which Gunabe agreed to repay the
loan over an 84-month term. In October 2020, Pinnacle Bank assigned its rights
and interest in the loan to Plaintiff Bankers Healthcare Group, LLC (BHG). In
December 2022, BHG alleges Gunabe breached the loan agreement by failing to
make the required scheduled payments.
On July
18, 2023, BHG filed a complaint against Gunabe, alleging a single cause of
action for breach of promissory note. From October to November 2023, BHG served
notice on Gunabe via publication.
On December
19, 2023, default was entered against Gunabe. On January 29, 2024, BHG
submitted the present application for default judgment.
A case
management conference and OSC Re: Default/Default Judgment is set for March 25,
2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
BHG
seeks default judgment against Gunabe in the total amount of $161,306.86,
including $128,153.52 in damages, $28,074.40 in interest, $3,171.53 in attorney
fees, and $1,907.41 in costs. Because the court finds BHG has submitted
sufficient evidence, the court GRANTS their application for default
judgment.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, BHG’s
application for default judgment is GRANTED.
