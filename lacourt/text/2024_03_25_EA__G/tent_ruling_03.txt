 Case Number:  23PSCV03224    Hearing Date:   March 25, 2024    Dept:  G Plaintiff Bank of America, N.A.’s Application for Default
Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Bank of America, N.A.’s Application for
Default Judgment is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
This
is a collections action. In March 1999, Defendant Jennifer Nobile opened a
credit account with FIA Card Services, N.A. who merged with Plaintiff Bank of
America, N.A. (Bank of America) in October 2014. After February 2021, Nobile
allegedly failed to make payments due and in July 2021, Bank of America charged
off the account.
On October
18, 2023, Bank of America filed a complaint against Nobile and Does 1-10, alleging
a single cause of action for common counts. On November 5, Bank of America’s
process server served Nobile in Glendora with substitute service.
On December
21, 2023, default was entered against Nobile and Bank of America submitted the
present application for default judgment.
A case
management conference is set for March 25, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
Bank
of America seeks default judgment against Nobile in the total amount of $35,394.73,
including $34,787.16 in damages and $607.57 in costs. Because the court finds Bank
of America has submitted sufficient evidence, the court GRANTS their
application for default judgment.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Bank
of America’s application for default judgment is GRANTED.
