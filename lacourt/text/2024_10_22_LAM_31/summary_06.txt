And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike portions of the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by the plaintiff, Ricardo Alas, against the defendants, Fathers of St. Charles, et al. The motion sought to strike paragraphs 18, 27, 34, 41, 50, 57, 65, 73, 80, 106, and paragraph 2 of the prayer for relief of the FAC, which relate to punitive and exemplary damages.

The court granted the motion as to Fathers of St. Charles, as it is a religious corporation and the plaintiff failed to seek leave of court to make allegations supporting punitive and exemplary damages. However, the court denied the motion as to individual defendants, Father Adilso and Afshar, as there was insufficient evidence to support the punitive damages allegations against them.

The court found that the allegations supporting punitive damages against individual defendants were insufficient and failed to state a prima facie claim for punitive damages. The court also found that the comments made by Father Adilso and Afshar regarding the age of the employees and the plaintiff speaking Spanish did not rise to the level of malice, fraud, or oppression.

The court granted leave to amend the FAC to allege punitive damages against Fathers of St. Charles, but denied leave to amend as to individual defendants, pending further discovery.
