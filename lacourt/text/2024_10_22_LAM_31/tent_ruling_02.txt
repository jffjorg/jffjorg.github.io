I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On January 17,
2023, plaintiff Karen Garush Berkibekyan (Berkibekyan) commenced this action against
defendants Narek Eric Kazarian and Genesis Investments Group, LLC (collectively,
Defendants) for the cancellation of a recorded written trust instrument which
affects Berkibekyan’s real property located at 12662 Meadowlark Avenue, Granada
Hills, CA 91344. 
 
            On October 17,
2023, Defendants filed a Cross-Complaint against Berkibekyan. 
 
            On November
20, 2023, Counsel for Berkibekyan filed a declaration attesting to having
received service of the Cross-Complaint. 
 
On March 11, 2024, default was entered against Berkibekyan
on Defendants’ Cross-Complaint.
 
On April 24, 2024, Berkibekyan’s counsel was relieved as
counsel for Berkibekyan. 
 
On August 22, 2024, Berkibekyan filed a Substitution of
Attorney.  
 
            On September
9, 2024, Berkibekyan filed this Motion to Set Aside Default and Vacate Default
Judgment, If Entered.
 
The motion is unopposed. 

II.        LEGAL STANDARD 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
473, subdivision (b) provides that a court may “relieve a party or his or her
legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding
taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.”  In addition, a court must vacate a default or
dismissal when a motion for relief under Section 473, subdivision (b) is filed
timely and accompanied by an attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to the
attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect “unless the court finds
that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the attorney’s mistake,
inadvertence, surprise or neglect.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd.
(b).)   
 
The party or the legal
representative must seek such relief “within a reasonable time, in no case
exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was
taken.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); see Rappleyea v. Campbell
(1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 980 [“because more than six months had elapsed from the
entry of default, and hence relief under section 473 was unavailable”]; People
v. The North River Ins. Co. (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 712, 721 [motion for
relief under section 473 must be brought “within a reasonable time, in no case
exceeding six months”].)   
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
Berkibekyan seeks to vacate the entry of default on the
grounds of mistake, surprise, or excusable neglect.  Specifically, Berkibekyan explains she was
unaware that a Cross-Complaint was filed on October 17, 2023, and former
counsel did not file an answer to the Cross-Complaint.  Further, when former counsel’s motion to be
relieved as counsel was granted on April 24, 2024, the order relieving former
counsel did not indicate Berkibekyan was in default.  Berkeibekyan learned default was entered only
upon obtaining new counsel on August 22, 2024.   (Berkibekyan, ¶¶ 4-12.)  A copy of Berkibekyan’s proposed answer is
attached to Berkibekyan’s declaration.  For
these reasons, Berkibekyan argues the default should be set aside.  
 
A court may vacate a default or
dismissal when a motion for relief under Section 473, subdivision (b) is filed
timely and accompanied by the party’s sworn affidavit attesting to the party’s
mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (b).)   
 
The court finds Berkibekyan is
entitled to relief.  The motion was
timely filed and is supported by the proposed pleading to be filed.  There is no opposition filed directing a
different result. 
 
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
The unopposed motion is GRANTED.  The default entered against Plaintiff and
Cross-Defendant Karen Garush Berkibekyan on March 11, 2024 is VACATED.  The proposed answer to the Cross-Complaint is
deemed filed as of this date.  
 
Moving party to give notice.
