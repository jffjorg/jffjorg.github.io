Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer to the defendants' motion to strike and the demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint. The judge sustained the demurrer to the first, second, and fourth causes of action, but overruled the demurrer to the sixth, seventh, and eighth causes of action.

The judge also granted the motion to strike punitive damages from the complaint, finding that the defendants are entitled to an order striking punitive damages because the complaint does not allege that any officer, director, or managing agent of the defendants had advance knowledge of the unfitness of an employee and employed them with a conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others, or authorized or ratified the wrongful conduct.

The judge granted leave to amend the complaint and ordered the plaintiffs to serve and file their third amended complaint within 15 days of the date of the order.
