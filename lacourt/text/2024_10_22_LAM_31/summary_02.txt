And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to set aside the default and vacate the default judgment. The plaintiff had been unaware of a cross-complaint being filed against them and their former counsel had not filed an answer to the cross-complaint. As a result, the plaintiff did not learn about the default until after they had obtained new counsel. The court finds that the plaintiff is entitled to relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b) and grants the motion. The default is vacated and the proposed answer to the cross-complaint is deemed filed as of the date of the ruling.
