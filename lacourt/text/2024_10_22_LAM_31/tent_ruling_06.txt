MOTION
TO STRIKE PORTIONS OF PLAINTIFF’S FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendants
Fathers of St. Charles dba Villa Scalabrini Retirement Center & Special
Care Unit, et al.
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiff
Ricardo Alas 
 
 
I.          FACTUAL AND
PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
 
            This is a FEHA case.
In 1989, Fathers of St. Charles, doing business as Villa Scalabrini Retirement
Center and Special Care Unit (Fathers of St. Charles), a residential care and
skilled nursing facility, hired Ricardo Alas (Alas or Plaintiff) as the
Director of activities.  Father Adilso
Balen and (Father Adilso) and Ardeshir Afshar (Afshar) were Alas’s supervisors.
 Alas alleges he was passed over for a
promotion for which he was qualified, was discriminated against for
communicating in Spanish among residents, and was wrongfully terminated after a
pretextual investigation into an allegation of abuse made by a resident against
Alas.     
 
            On June 24, 2024, Plaintiff
commenced this action against Fathers of St. Charles, Adilso Balen, and
Ardeshir Afshar (collectively, Defendants). 
On August 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed the operative pleading, the First
Amended Complaint (FAC), alleging causes of action for:
 
1.     
Discrimination
in Violation of the Fair Employment Housing Act (FEHA);
2.     
Hostile
Work Environment in Violation of the FEHA;
3.     
Retaliation
in Violation of the FEHA;
4.     
Failure
to Provide Reasonable Accommodations in Violation of the FEHA;
5.     
Failure
to Engage in the Interactive Process in Violation of the FEHA;
6.     
CFRA
Leave Interference;
7.     
CFRA
Leave Retaliation;
8.     
Failing
to Take Al Reasonable Steps to Prevent Discrimination, Harassment, Or
Retaliation in Violation of FEHA;
9.     
Violation
of Labor Code § 1102.5 (Whistleblower Retaliation);
10. 
Violation
of Labor Code § 232.5 (Retaliation For Reporting Working Conditions);
11. 
Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress; and
12. 
Negligent
Hiring, Supervision, and Retention.     
 
The second and
eleventh causes of action are the only causes of action alleged against individual
defendants Father Adilso and Afshar. Plaintiff seeks punitive and exemplary
damages. 
 
On September 18,
2024, Defendants filed this Motion to Strike Portions of Plaintiff’s FAC.  Those portions all relate to punitive and
exemplary damages. 
 
On October 9,
2018, Plaintiff filed an opposition.
 
On October 14,
2018, Defendants filed a reply. 
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD 
 
            Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a
pleading, may serve and file a motion to strike the whole pleading or any part
thereof.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (b)(1); Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1322, subd. (b).)¿ On a motion to strike, the court may: (1) strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court.¿ (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 436, subds. (a)-(b); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767,
782.)¿¿ 
 
“The grounds for a motion to
strike are limited to matters appearing on the face of the challenged pleading
or matters which must or may be judicially noticed. (§ 437, subd. (a); Evid.
Code, §§ 451, 452.).” (Garcia v. Sterling (1985) 176 Cal.App.3d 17,
20.)¿ 
 
III.       JUDICIAL
NOTICE
 
Defendants request
judicial notice of the following documents:[1] 
 
1.     
Villa
Scalabrini Statement of Information filed with the State of California,
Secretary of State (Request for Judicial Notice (RJN) 1);
2.     
Entity
Status Letter issued by the California Franchise Tax Board regarding Fathers of
St. Charles (RJN 2);
3.     
Statement
of Information dated May 23, 2024, regarding Fathers of St. Charles (RJN 3);
4.     
Domestic
Corporation Annual Report, dated March 28, 2024 and filed with the State of
Illinois, Secretary of State (RJN 4). 
 
The request is
GRANTED.  (Evid. Code, § 452, subds. (c),
(h).)  The court takes judicial notice of
the foregoing documents but not the truth of the statements contained therein
to the extent those statements are reasonably subject to dispute.  (Lockley v. Law Office of Cantreel, Green,
Pekich, Cruz & McCort (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 875, 882-83.)
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
Defendants seek an
order striking paragraphs 18, 27, 34, 41, 50, 57, 65, 73, 80, 106, and
paragraph 2 of the prayer for relief of the FAC.  Defendants contend that the court must strike
the punitive and exemplary damages allegations because Plaintiff has not filed
a motion pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) section 425.14.  With respect to defendant Villa Scalabrini,
the court agrees.
 
CCP section 425.14
provides, “[n]o claim for punitive or exemplary damages against a religious
corporation or religious corporation sole shall be included in a complaint or
other pleading unless the court enters an order allowing an amended pleading
that includes a claim for punitive or exemplary damages to be filed. The court
may allow the filing of an amended pleading claiming punitive or exemplary
damages on a motion by the party seeking the amended pleading and upon a
finding, on the basis of the supporting and opposing affidavits presented, that
the plaintiff has established evidence which substantiates that plaintiff will
meet the clear and convincing standard of proof under Section 3294 of the Civil
Code.” 
 
Here, Fathers of
St. Charles establishes it is a religious corporation.  The Domestic Corporation Annual Report filed
with the Secretary of State in the State of Illinois (RJN 4), states as
relevant here, “THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH THE CORPORATION [Fathers of St. Charles]
IS ORGANIZED ARE TO OPERATE EXCLUSIVELY FOR RELIGIOUS, CHARITABLE, EDUCATIONAL,
AND SCIENTIFIC PURPOSES, INCLUDING OPERATING FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE PROVINCE OF
ST. JOHN THE BAPTIST OF THE MISSIONARIES OF ST.CHARLES, A RELIGIOUS
CONGREGATION OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH.” 
(Emphasis in original.)  
 
The foregoing
language is clear.  Accordingly,
Plaintiff was required under CCP section 425.14 to seek leave of court to make
allegations supporting punitive and exemplary damages.  Having not done so, the punitive and exemplary
damages allegations as to Fathers of St. Charles are stricken.  
 
However, as to defendants
Father Adilso and Afshar, the court is not persuaded that CCP section 425.14
operates to foreclose punitive damages against individual defendants.  Defendants do not cite any authority showing
CCP section 425.14 applies in this context. 
 
Nonetheless, the
court finds there are insufficient facts to sustain the punitive damages
allegations against individual defendants.
 
Punitive damages
may be imposed where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that the
defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice.  (Civ. Code §
3294, subd. (a).) “Malice” is conduct intended by the defendant to cause injury
to the plaintiff or despicable conduct which is carried on with a willful and
conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.  (Civ. Code § 3294,
subd. (c)(1).) “‘Punitive damages are proper only when the tortious conduct
rises to levels of extreme indifference to the plaintiff’s rights, a level
which decent citizens should not have to tolerate.’ [Citation.]”  (Lackner
v. North (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 1188, 1210.)  “As amended to include
[despicable], the [Civil Code section 3294] plainly indicates that absent an
intent to injure the plaintiff, ‘malice’ requires more than a ‘willful and
conscious’ disregard of the plaintiffs’ interests.  The additional
component of ‘despicable conduct’ must be found.”  (College Hospital
Inc. v. Superior Court (1994) 8 Cal.4th 704, 725.) The statute’s reference
to despicable conduct represents a “new substantive limitation on punitive
damage awards.”  (Id.)  Despicable conduct is “conduct which
is so vile, base, contemptible, miserable, wretched or loathsome that it would
be looked down upon and despised by ordinary decent people.  Such conduct
has been described as ‘having the character of outrage frequently associated
with crime.’”  (Tomaselli v. Transamerica Ins. Co. (1994) 25
Cal.App.4th 1269, 1287.)  Further, “[t]here must be evidence that
defendant acted with knowledge of the probable dangerous consequences to
plaintiff’s interests and deliberately failed to avoid these
consequences.”  (Flyer’s Body Shop Profit Sharing Plan v. Ticor Title
Ins. Co. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 1149, 1155; see also Angie M. v. Superior
Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1228 [“Conscious disregard for the safety
of another may be sufficient where the defendant is aware of the probably
dangerous consequences of his or her conduct and he or she willfully fails to
avoid such consequences”].) 
 
A motion to strike
punitive damages is properly granted where a plaintiff does not state a prima
facie claim for punitive damages, including allegations that defendant is
guilty of oppression, fraud or malice.  (Turman v. Turning Point of
Cent. California, Inc. (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 53, 63.)  “Mere
negligence, even gross negligence, is not sufficient to justify such an award”
for punitive damages.  (Kendall Yacht Corp. v. United California Bank (1975)
50 Cal.App.3d 949, 958.)  The allegations supporting a request for
punitive damages must be alleged with specificity; conclusory allegations
without sufficient facts are not enough.  (Smith v. Superior Court
(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1033, 1041-1042.) 
 
Here, the sum of
the facts alleged in support of punitive damages against individual defendants amount
to four events: (1) another employee told Plaintiff that Father Adilso stated
there were too many old people working for Villa Scalabrini (FAC, ¶ 14b); (2) Afshar
once told Plaintiff to stop speaking Spanish around the residents because it
made them uncomfortable (FAC, ¶ 14d); (3) Plaintiff was not considered for a
promotion for which he was qualified and which was given to a younger, less
qualified employee; and (4) after a resident accused Plaintiff of abuse, Father
Adilso suspended Plaintiff, conducted a three-day investigation, and thereafter,
terminated Plaintiff’s employment (FAC, ¶¶ 14i, 14j, 15).  Plaintiff further alleges the investigation
into alleged abuse was pretextual.  (FAC,
¶ 15.)  
 
These allegations
are insufficient.  As alleged, Father
Adilso’s and Afshar’s comments regarding the age of the employees and Plaintiff
speaking Spanish do not alone rise to the level of malice, fraud, or
oppression. They are also untethered to the one adverse employment action
identified in the FAC: Plaintiff’s termination. 
And, as to Father Adilso’s decision to terminate Plaintiff’s employment,
such an action gives rise to liability to the employer, Fathers of St. Charles,
rather than Father Adilso himself.  
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
            Accordingly,
the motion is GRANTED.  Paragraphs 18,
27, 34, 41, 50, 57, 65, 73, 80, 106, and paragraph 2 of the prayer for relief
of the FAC are stricken.  Leave to amend
is DENIED without prejudice.  Plaintiff
may seek leave to allege punitive damages against Defendant Fathers of St.
Charles pursuant to CCP section 425.16. 
As to individual defendants, Plaintiff may seek leave to allege punitive
damages if more facts are learned through discovery. 
 
            Defendants to
give notice.
