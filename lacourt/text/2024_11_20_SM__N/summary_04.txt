And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motions for relief from default filed by defendants Jiayi Xu and Chloe Ding. Xu seeks to set aside a default judgment entered against her on June 28, 2024, claiming that she did not receive actual notice of the action. The judge finds that Xu's account is credible and that there is no evidence that she was properly served in a code-compliant manner. Ding seeks to set aside a default entered against her on June 28, 2024, claiming that she did not understand the documents due to a language barrier and that she did not receive actual notice of the action. The judge finds that Ding has properly demonstrated excusable neglect and mistake in not answering the complaint, and grants her motion.
