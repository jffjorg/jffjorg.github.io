And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Keyhan Ghotbi's demurrer to Rouhani Construction, Inc.'s Second Amended Cross-Complaint. Ghotbi had demurred to each cause of action in the cross-complaint, but the judge found that the pleading was sufficient to state a cause of action for breach of contract. The judge also found that the cross-complaint stated a claim for money had and received, and that Ghotbi's demurrer to this cause of action was without merit. As a result, Ghotbi is ordered to file and serve an answer to the cross-complaint within 10 days of the entry of this order.
