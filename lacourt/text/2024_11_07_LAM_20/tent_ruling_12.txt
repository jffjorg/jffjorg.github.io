Jerry’s daughter, non-party Krista Jamgotchian, seeks $82,963 in attorneys’ fees, costs, interest, and damages because she contends that Done! wrongfully levied $10,533.57 from her account at Preferred Bank.  Krista contends that this damaged her as a student.  Krista’s request seems to be at least partially based on Code Civ. Proc. § 128.7.Under Code Civ. Proc. § 128.7, a court may impose sanctions for filing a pleading if the court concludes the pleading was filed for an improper purpose or was indisputably without factual or legal merit.  (Guillemin v. Stein (2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 156, 168.)  A claim is factually frivolous if it is “not well grounded in fact” and it is legally frivolous if it is “not warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law.”  (Id. at p. 167.)  In either case, to obtain sanctions, the moving party must show the party's conduct in asserting the claim was objectively unreasonable.  (Ibid.)  A claim is objectively unreasonable if “any reasonable attorney would agree that [it] is totally and completely without merit.” (In re Marriage of Flaherty (1982) 31 Cal.3d 637, 650; Guillemin, supra, at p. 168.)The Motion is denied because, among other things, the Court does not believe that Done!’s conduct was frivolous or calculated to cause delay.  The Court finds no other valid basis to award fees and damages.Done! to give notice.
