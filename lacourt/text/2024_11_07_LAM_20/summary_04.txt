And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion for summary judgment and has found that the power of attorney (POA) relied upon by the defendants to transfer the property is invalid. The POA was signed by Ervin Hogan, who had Alzheimer's disease and lacked the capacity to sign the document. The court finds that the POA was invalid and grants the motion for summary adjudication as to the first three causes of action, which seek to quiet title to the subject property. The court also notes that the plaintiffs have not shown evidence of damages for the fourth and fifth causes of action, which claim conversion and common count, and that the plaintiffs have stated that they will dismiss these claims if they prevail on their equitable causes of action. The motion for summary adjudication is granted, and the objections are overruled.
