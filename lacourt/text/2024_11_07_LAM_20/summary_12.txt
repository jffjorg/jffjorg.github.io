Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge finds that Done!'s conduct was not frivolous or calculated to cause delay, and therefore does not believe that sanctions are warranted under Code Civil Procedure Section 128.7. The judge also finds no other valid basis to award fees and damages to Krista Jamgotchian.
