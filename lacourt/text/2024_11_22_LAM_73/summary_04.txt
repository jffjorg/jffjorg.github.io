And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court denies Plaintiffs' Renewed Motion for Award of Attorneys' Fees and Costs. The motion was filed late due to Plaintiffs' counsel's mistake and inadvertence, but the court finds that Section 473 does not provide relief in this context. The court also finds that the motion was untimely because the time prescribed by California Rules of Court Rule 8.104 to appeal from the judgment was not extended by the filing of a valid motion to vacate judgment.

The court notes that the Building was constructed in 1958 and never intended to be a residential property, but was illegally converted into 12 cramped and illegal residential units. The court also finds that Farhang failed to obtain permits to convert the Building to residential units and that the Building had numerous health and safety hazards.

The court denies Plaintiffs' motion for attorney's fees because it was filed late and was not timely. The court also denies Plaintiffs' counsel's request for relief under Section 473 because the court finds that Section 473 does not apply in this context.
