Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge granted Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to Special Interrogatories (Set One) and request for monetary sanctions. The Court ordered Defendant to provide verified responses to the Special Interrogatories within 30 days. The Court also granted Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $1,200 in attorney's fees. The Court found that Defendant failed to justify its objections to the Special Interrogatories and that Plaintiff had made a good faith attempt at an informal resolution of the issues presented by the motion.
