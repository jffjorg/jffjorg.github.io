PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION (filed on 07/16/24)
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff’s Motion for Reconsideration is
DENIED.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On July 27,
2022, Plaintiff Robert Lee filed this action against Defendants William Kim and
Lorna Kim. Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint asserts causes of action for:
(1) Libel and (2) Slander.
 
The Complaint
alleges that beginning in late April 2021, Defendants Lorna Kim and her husband
William Kim began a defamatory campaign accusing Lorna’s uncle, Plaintiff, of
molesting Lorna as a child. The Complaint further alleges Defendants published
these defamatory statements by speaking and sending text messages to family
members and building tenants. 
 
On July 9,
2024, the Court granted Defendant Lorna Kim’s Motion for Terminating Sanctions.

 
On July 16,
2024, Plaintiff filed this Motion for Reconsideration, arguing:
·      
Plaintiff moves the Court for
reconsideration of this Court’s July 09, 2024, ruling for terminating sanctions
against Plaintiff.
·      
At the time of said July 9, 2024,
ruling, the Defendant Lorna Kim misled the Court by concealing her refusal to
comply with the Court’s January 26, 2024, ruling requiring both Plaintiff and
Defendant to be available for deposition.
·      
The Court had already been alerted at
least five times of the continued danger of the mother-daughter collusion at
deposition. 
·      
Therefore, Plaintiff’s motion for
reconsideration to the Court represents new facts under Code Civ. Proc. § 1008(a).
Defendant
Lorna Kim filed an opposition, arguing:
·      
As a threshold matter, this motion should not be heard because
Plaintiff filed an appeal, which triggers an automatic stay on this action.
Without jurisdiction to entertain Plaintiff’s motion during the pendency of the
appeal, this Court should disregard the motion in its entirety. 
·      
Even if the Court were to consider Plaintiff’s Motion for
Reconsideration, it should be denied because it lacks new facts, relevant legal
grounds, or any other basis for reconsideration. Plaintiff’s arguments rely on
allegations unrelated to this case and seek to misinterpret this Court’s
orders. Deposition issues in an unrelated case are irrelevant to the
terminating sanctions.
Defendant Leonard Lee filed a Notice of
Joinder to Defendant Lorna Kim’s Opposition.
Plaintiff filed a reply, arguing Defendants
engaged in deposition misconduct in a separate case.
II. ANALYSIS
 
A.      Legal
Standard 
 
The moving party must present new facts,
circumstances or law in order to grant a motion for reconsideration.  (See
CCP § 1008(a); see also Mink v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th
1338, 1342.)  The party seeking reconsideration of an order shall state by
affidavit what application was made before, what order or decisions were made,
and what new or different facts or circumstances are claimed to be shown. 
(CCP § 1008(a).)  Further, “…the party seeking reconsideration must
provide not only new evidence but also a satisfactory explanation for the
failure to produce that evidence at an earlier time.” (Glade v. Glade
(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1441, 1457 [emphasis added].)  The legislative
intent was to restrict motions for reconsideration to circumstances where a
party offers the court some fact or circumstance not previously considered and
some valid reason for not offering it earlier. (Gilberd v. AC Transit
(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1494, 1500.)
  
B.      Timeliness
 
Plaintiff
states in his reply that Defendant’s opposition was filed late, on November 5,
2024, as the hearing date in this matter was set for November 8, 2024. However, a court may properly consider papers
that are not timely filed pursuant to CCP section 1005(b) unless “substantial
rights” are affected.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1300(d); Code Civ.
Proc., § 475.)  The appearance of a party at the hearing of a motion and
his or her opposition to the motion on the merits is a waiver of any procedural
defects or irregularities in a motion.  (Carlton v. Quint (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 690, 697.) Here,
Plaintiff was able to file a reply addressing the merits of Defendant’s
opposition. The Court does not find that substantial rights were affected, and
the Court exercises its discretion to consider Defendant’s opposition.

Plaintiff
requests the Court take judicial notice of the following:

The court may
take judicial notice of “official acts of the legislative, executive, and
judicial departments of the United States and of any state of the United
States,” “[r]ecords of (1) any court of this state or (2) any court of record
of the United States or of any state of the United States,” and “[f]acts and
propositions that are not reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of
immediate and accurate determination by resort to sources of reasonably
indisputable accuracy.” (Evid. Code § 452, subds. (c), (d), and (h).) The Court
may take judicial notice of its own file. (See Stepan v. Garcia (1974) 43 Cal.App.3d 497, 500.)
 
The Court
grants Plaintiff’s above requests for judicial notice nos. 1-11. 
 
D.     Discussion
 
Plaintiff
moves the Court for
reconsideration of the July 9, 2024
Order granting terminating sanctions against Plaintiff.
On September 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
notice of appeal of the July 9, 2024 Order.
“…[T]he¿perfecting¿of an appeal stays
proceedings in the trial court upon the judgment or order appealed from or upon
the matters embraced therein or affected thereby, including enforcement of the
judgment or order, but the trial court may proceed upon any other matter
embraced in the action and not affected by the judgment or order.”¿
CCP¿§¿916(a).¿¿The automatic stay applies if¿the trial court
proceeding¿“directly or indirectly seek[s]¿to enforce, vacate or modify
appealed judgment or order[,]…[when]¿[a] trial court proceeding also affects
the effectiveness of an appeal if the possible outcomes on appeal and the
actual or possible results of the proceeding are irreconcilable…[or when]
a¿proceeding affects the effectiveness of the appeal if the very purpose of the
appeal is to avoid the need for that proceeding.”¿¿(Varian Medical Systems,
Inc. v. Delfino¿(2005) 35 Cal.4th 180, 189-90.)¿ 
Here, Plaintiff’s Motion seeks
reconsideration of the July 9, 2024 Order. However, this order has been
appealed. Therefore, if the Court rules on Plaintiff’s Motion, it would
directly affect the July 9, 2024 Order and affect the effectiveness of
Plaintiff’s appeal. 
Based on the foregoing, the Court lacks
jurisdiction to hear Plaintiff’s Motion for Reconsideration. Therefore, the
Court DENIES Plaintiff’s motion. 

II.
DISPOSITION
 
Plaintiff’s Motion for Reconsideration is DENIED.
