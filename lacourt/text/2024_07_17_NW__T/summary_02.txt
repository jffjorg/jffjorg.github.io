And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff ADR Remodeling's request for default judgment against Defendant Brothers Developers, LLC without prejudice. The Judge grants Plaintiff 30 days to cure the defects identified in the request. The OSC re entry of default judgment is set for an unspecified date. The Judge found that Plaintiff has sufficiently presented facts to show that the parties entered into an oral agreement and/or that Defendant requested goods and services from Plaintiff, Plaintiff performed on the contract/provided the goods/services, Defendant failed to pay, and Plaintiff's damages/reasonable value of the goods/services. The Judge also found that Plaintiff's request for prejudgment interest is persuasive, but the requested interest of $25,524.14 is mathematically incorrect. The Judge further found that Plaintiff failed to meet its burden for entry of default judgment as to the second COA for lien foreclosure because the claimant failed to present evidence of the date the work was completed or the date work ceased. The Judge also denied Plaintiff's request for a statutory penalty of $11,792.80 because it is grounded in Civil Code sections 8800 and 8812, which do not provide for any statutory penalty.
