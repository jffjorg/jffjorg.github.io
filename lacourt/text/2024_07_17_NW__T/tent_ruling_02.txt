 Case Number:  24VECV01763    Hearing Date:   July 17, 2024    Dept:  T TENTATIVE] ORDER:  Plaintiff ADR Remodeling’s Request for Default
Judgment is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE. 
Plaintiff ADR Remodeling is granted 30 days to cure the defects
identified.  OSC re entry of default
judgment is set for ____________________________.
Introduction 
Plaintiff ADR Remodeling
(Plaintiff) requested entry of default judgment against Defendant Brothers
Developers, LLC.  Plaintiff’s Complaint
alleged two causes of action: 1) quantum meruit and quantum valebant and 2) foreclosure
of mechanic’s lien.
Discussion 
As to Plaintiff’s first COA for
quantum meruit/quantum valebant, Plaintiff sufficiently presented facts to show
that the parties entered into an oral agreement and/or that Defendant requested
goods and services from Plaintiff, Plaintiff performed on the contract/provided
the goods/services, Defendant failed to pay, and Plaintiff’s damages/reasonable
value of the goods/services.  (CACI no.
371.)  Plaintiff’s request for judgment on
the first COA for $589,640.00 is persuasive. 

Plaintiff’s request for
prejudgment interest is persuasive. 
However, Plaintiff’s requested interest of $25,524.14 is mathematically
incorrect. There are 158 days  between
January 21, 2024, and June 27, 2024. 
Daily interest at 10% per annum for the principal of $589,640 is
$163.79.  Thus, total prejudgment
interest for the 158 days is $25,878.82 and not the $25,524.14 requested by
Plaintiff.  In any event, the prejudgment
interest amount will need to be recalculated once Plaintiff cures the defects
identified below.
Plaintiff’s request for cost of
$435.00 is seen as merited per the Cost Memo located at paragraph 7 of the
Request for Entry of Default Judgment.  
As to the second COA for lien
foreclosure, the claimant must establish the validity of its lien. (Basic
Modular Facilities, Inc. v. Ehsanipour (1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 1480, 1485.)  The claimant must prove, at a minimum, that
the labor, services,  equipment, or
materials were actually used in the work of improvement, the reasonable value
of the claimant's contribution, and the date the work was completed or the date
the work ceased. (Id.; Precision Framing Systems Inc. v. Luzuriaga (2019) 39
Cal.App.5th 457, 466; Civ. Code, secs. 8412 & 8414.)  Plaintiff’s declaration failed to present
evidence of the date the work was completed or the date work ceased.  Without such evidence, Plaintiff failed to
meet its burden for entry of default judgment as to the second COA for lien
foreclosure.
Plaintiff further requested a
statutory penalty of $11,792.80. 
Plaintiff asserted that the statutory penalty is grounded in Civil Code,
sections 8800 and 8812.  (See Gavriel Ebaiov’s
Declaration, par. 9.)  However, neither
of these two statutes provide for any statutory penalty.  Without identifying a proper statute for the
request, the request is improper and unpersuasive.
The request for default judgment
is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
