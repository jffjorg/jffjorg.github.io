And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Petitioner Lataynia Burton's petition for an order relieving her from the requirements of Government Code section 945.4. The petition was filed after the City of Los Angeles denied Petitioner's request for leave to present a late claim beyond the deadline set forth in Government Code section 911.2. The judge found that the petition did not meet the three conditions required to excuse the requirement of timely presenting a government claim. Specifically, the judge concluded that the failure to timely file the claim was not due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, as Petitioner's counsel was aware of the identity and address of the individual responsible for the motor vehicle accident as of June 6, 2022. The judge also noted that a reasonably prudent person in the same or similar circumstances would have been able to learn that the individual was an employee of the City without a police report. As a result, the petition was denied.
