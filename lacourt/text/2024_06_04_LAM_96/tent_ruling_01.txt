  Case Number:  19STCV00074    Hearing Date:   June 4, 2024    Dept:  96 The Court has read and considered the motion for defense
expert witness fees of $69,204.00 based on Plaintiff recovering less than the
998 offer of Defendant.  Plaintiff was awarded $110,00 by the jury, less
than the $125,000 offer in the 998, which was withdrawn by operation of law on
February 17, 2024.  The Court has reviewed the amounts requested,
including the bills and finds the post offer expert costs are reasonable and
not excessive.  The Court finds that Defendant’s experts were reasonably
necessary on the issue of Plaintiff’s claims of traumatic brain injury,
tinnitus, post-traumatic stress disorder, in addition to a claim of spinal
injuries. The motion is Granted.
