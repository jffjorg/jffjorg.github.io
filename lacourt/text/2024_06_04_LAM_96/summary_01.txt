And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the motion for defense expert witness fees of $69,204.00 and has granted the motion. The court found that the post-offer expert costs are reasonable and not excessive. The court also found that the defendant's experts were reasonably necessary on the issue of the plaintiff's claims of traumatic brain injury, tinnitus, post-traumatic stress disorder, and spinal injuries. The defendant's 998 offer of $125,000 was withdrawn by operation of law on February 17, 2024. The jury awarded the plaintiff $110,000, which is less than the defendant's 998 offer.
