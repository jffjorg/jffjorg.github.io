And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for summary adjudication on the grounds that the defendant has not met its initial burden of proving the absence of a disputed issue or material fact. The defendant's motion is based on the indemnification provisions in the lease agreement between Subway and Mastagni, which require Mastagni to indemnify Subway for any damages arising from claims or lawsuits brought by any person, entity, or attorney general for violation of any code, law, or regulation. The judge finds that the evidence presented by the defendant is insufficient to establish that the indemnification provisions apply in the context of the dispute, and that there are disputed issues of material fact that need to be resolved at trial.
