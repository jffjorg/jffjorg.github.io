Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer and motion to strike filed by General Motors, LLC against a complaint filed by Kevin Symons. The complaint alleges fraud and unfair competition based on General Motors' alleged concealment of material facts and failure to disclose information about the battery defect in Symons' Bolt vehicle. The judge has sustained the demurrer and motion to strike as to the first cause of action for fraud, finding that the complaint fails to state a cause of action because it does not allege the specific facts required to prove fraud. The judge has also sustained the demurrer and motion to strike as to the second cause of action for unfair competition, finding that the complaint fails to allege specific facts sufficient to establish the claim. The judge will require oral argument on whether Symons can sufficiently amend the complaint.
