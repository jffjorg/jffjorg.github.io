Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendant's motion for an order determining that a replacement vehicle is not available and that the plaintiff is only entitled to reimbursement of the price he paid for the subject vehicle. The judge rules that the defendant must replace the plaintiff's subject vehicle with a new vehicle that is substantially identical to the subject vehicle, as required by Civil Code ยง1793.2(d)(2)(A). The judge also notes that the jury's special verdict is not challenged and that the plaintiff is entitled to a new motor vehicle substantially identical to the subject vehicle. The judge denies the defendant's motion and orders the defendant to provide notice of the ruling.
