 Hearing Date:  August 14, 2024



 

Defendant

replacement vehicle is not available; and (2) Plaintiff Artur Roushanian is
therefore only entitled to reimbursement of the price he paid for the Subject
Vehicle is denied.
 
Defendant BMW of North America, LLC (“BMW NA”)
(“Defendant”) moves for an order determining that (1) a replacement vehicle is
not available; and (2) Plaintiff Artur Roushanian (“Roushanian”) (“Plaintiff”)
is therefore only entitled to reimbursement of the price he paid for the
Subject Vehicle.  (Notice Motion, pg. 2.)
 
Background
On July 12, 2019, Plaintiff bought a used 2019
BMW M5 Sedan (“Subject Vehicle”) from ST Exotics. The total sale price of the
Subject Vehicle was $110,703.00.
On January 12, 2024, the jury returned a
special verdict finding that Defendant had failed to repair Plaintiff’s vehicle
and awarding Plaintiff “[r]eplacement of the vehicle with a new vehicle which
is reasonably equivalent to the Plaintiff’s vehicle.”  On February 7, 2024, this Court entered
judgment on the verdict.
          Defendant
filed the instant motion on June 12, 2024. 
Plaintiff filed his opposition on July 11, 2024.[1] 
Defendant filed its reply on August 7, 2024.
 
Legal Standard
Civil
Code §1793.2(d)(2)(A) provides:
(2) If the manufacturer or its representative in this state is
unable to service or repair a new motor vehicle, as that term is defined in
paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 1793.22, to conform to the
applicable express warranties after a reasonable number of attempts, the
manufacturer shall either promptly replace the new motor vehicle in accordance
with subparagraph (A) or promptly make restitution to the buyer in accordance
with subparagraph (B). However, the buyer shall be free to elect restitution in
lieu of replacement, and in no event shall the buyer be required by the
manufacturer to accept a replacement vehicle.
 
(A) In the case of replacement, the manufacturer shall replace the
buyer’s vehicle with a new motor vehicle substantially identical to the vehicle
replaced. The replacement vehicle shall be accompanied by all express and
implied warranties that normally accompany new motor vehicles of that specific
kind. The manufacturer also shall pay for, or to, the buyer the amount of any
sales or use tax, license fees, registration fees, and other official fees
which the buyer is obligated to pay in connection with the replacement, plus
any incidental damages to which the buyer is entitled under Section 1794,
including, but not limited to, reasonable repair, towing, and rental car costs
actually incurred by the buyer.
 
(Civ. Code §1793.2(d)(2)(A).)
 
Discussion
Defendant’s motion for an order determining
that (1) a replacement vehicle is not available; and (2) Plaintiff is therefore
only entitled to reimbursement of the price he paid for the Subject Vehicle is
denied.
Civil Code §1793.2(d)(2)(A) clearly states, 
 
In the case of replacement, the manufacturer shall replace the
buyer’s vehicle with a new motor vehicle substantially identical to the vehicle
replaced. The replacement vehicle shall be accompanied by all express and
implied warranties that normally accompany new motor vehicles of that specific
kind. The manufacturer also shall pay for, or to, the buyer the amount of
any sales or use tax, license fees, registration fees, and other official fees
which the buyer is obligated to pay in connection with the replacement, plus
any incidental damages to which the buyer is entitled under Section 1794,
including, but not limited to, reasonable repair, towing, and rental car costs
actually incurred by the buyer.
 
(Civ. Code §1793.2(d)(2)(A), emphasis added.)
          Here,
the jury awarded Defendant replace Plaintiff’s Subject Vehicle with a new
vehicle which was reasonably equivalent to the Subject Vehicle.  (Judgment, pgs. 4, 13.)  The parties agree that no new 2019 BMW M5
Sedan is available with an active warranty. 
Therefore, Defendant must replace Plaintiff’s Subject Vehicle “with a
new motor vehicle substantially identical [to the Subject Vehicle.]”  (Civ. Code §1793.2(d)(2)(A), emphasis added.)
Because
of the myriad of issues that arise in determining whether a replacement vehicle
is comparable, Plaintiff has agreed to accept four different options: (1) a new
M5 Competition; (2) a new M8 Competition; (3) $137,949.06— the equivalent purchasing
power of Plaintiff’s purchase in November 2018; or (4) the amount needed to purchase
a new M5 Competition, $175,000.00. 
(Opposition, pg. 8.)
          This Court is disinclined to challenge
the jury’s special verdict, and such a challenge to the Judgment, entered on
February 7, 2024, is inappropriate at this juncture.  Pursuant to the jury verdict and Civil Code
§1793.2(d)(2)(A), Plaintiff is entitled to a new motor vehicle substantially
identical to the Subject Vehicle.
          Accordingly, Defendant’s motion is
denied.
 
Conclusion
Defendant’s motion is denied.  
Moving Party to give notice.
