 Case No.: 
  21STCV03788
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  August 14, 2024



 
Defendants
Edwin Kawasaki’s, Steve Radell’s, William Miller’s, William Janson’s, Caj
Brejtfus’, Lois Evans’, Stephen Pattillo’s, Briana Pattillo’s, Eric Pattillo’s,
Lionel Pereira’s, and Southern California Coin and Stamps’ motion for an order for
sanctions against Plaintiff Wesley Robbins is denied as moot.  
 
Defendants Edwin Kawasaki (“Kawasaki”), Steve
Radell (“Radell”), William Miller (“Miller”), William Janson (“Janson”), Caj
Brejtfus (“Brejtfus”), Lois Evans (“Evans”), Stephen Pattillo (“S. Pattillo”),
Briana Pattillo (“B. Pattillo”), Eric Pattillo (“E. Pattillo”), Lionel Pereira
(“Pereira”), and Southern California Coin and Stamps (“SCCS”) (collectively, “Moving
Defendants”) move for this Court to order sanctions against Plaintiff Wesley
Robbins (“Robbins”) (“Plaintiff”) on the grounds that throughout this
litigation, and in particular with the approach of trial, Plaintiff has engaged
in actions or tactics made in bad faith, that are frivolous and solely intended
to cause unnecessary delay, as well as to impose significantly increasing
unnecessary litigation expenses on Moving Defendants.  (Notice Motion, pg. 2; C.C.P. §128.5.)
 
Background
Moving Defendants filed the instant motion on
July 2, 2024.  Plaintiff filed his
opposition on August 5, 2024.  Moving
Defendants filed their reply on August 7, 2024.
 
Legal Standard
C.C.P. §128.7(a) provides:
Every pleading, petition, written notice of motion, or other
similar paper shall be signed by at least one attorney of record in the
attorney’s individual name, or, if the party is not represented by an attorney,
shall be signed by the party. Each paper shall state the signer’s address and
telephone number, if any. Except when otherwise provided by law, pleadings need
not be verified or accompanied by affidavit. An unsigned paper shall be
stricken unless omission of the signature is corrected promptly after being
called to the attention of the attorney or party.
 
A C.C.P. §128.7 motion involves a two-step
process. The moving party first serves the sanctions motion on the offending
party without filing it. The opposing party then has 21 days to withdraw the
improper pleading and avoid sanctions (the so-called “safe harbor” waiting
period).  At the end of the waiting
period, if the pleading is not withdrawn, the moving party may then file the
motion.  (C.C.P. §128.7(c)(1); Primo
Hospitality Group, Inc. v. Haney (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 165, 173-174; Martorana
v. Marlin & Saltzman (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 685, 698-699.)
 
Discussion
The Court denies Moving Defendants’ motion as
moot.  Moving Defendants’ motion
addresses trial preparation issues that are no longer relevant upon conclusion
of trial in this matter.
 
Conclusion
Moving Defendants’ motion for sanctions is
denied as moot. 
Moving Party to give notice.
