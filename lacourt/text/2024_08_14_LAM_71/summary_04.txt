And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendants' motion for sanctions against the plaintiff, Wesley Robbins, as moot. The defendants claimed that the plaintiff engaged in bad faith actions, causing unnecessary delay and increasing litigation expenses, but the judge finds that the issues addressed in the motion are no longer relevant since the trial has concluded. The judge notes that the plaintiff's alleged bad faith actions may have occurred during trial preparation, but since the trial is now over, the motion is denied as moot.
