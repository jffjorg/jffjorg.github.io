And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion of Hassan Mateen's counsel, Martin Aarons, Shannon Ward, and Aarons Ward APC, to be relieved as counsel. The motion was filed on July 11, 2024, and the trial is set for December 9, 2024. The judge's decision is based on California Rule of Court rule 3.1362, which requires notice of motion and motion to be directed to the client, a declaration stating the reason for the motion, service of the notice of motion and motion and declaration on all other parties, and a proposed order relieving counsel.

The judge found that counsel has complied with these requirements and that there has been a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The judge also noted that counsel has provided proof of service on the client and that the client has been notified of the motion. Therefore, the judge granted the motion and ordered that counsel be relieved upon filing proof of service on the client of the order granting the motion.
