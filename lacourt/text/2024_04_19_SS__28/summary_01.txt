And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is to continue the hearing on the revised petition to approve the compromise of Plaintiff Saghar Yadegar's claims filed by Petitioner Samira Yadegar. The Petitioner seeks to approve the compromise of Plaintiff's action, which was filed on January 19, 2024. The Petitioner has provided a revised petition and several supplements, including a June 24, 2022 letter from The Rawlings Company stating that the settlement amount does not include compensation for losses paid by Blue Shield of California. The Judge is concerned that the settlement funds must be distributed according to the laws and regulations governing court-approved compromises of claims. The Petitioner has requested a payment of $250,000.00 to Samira Yadegar, who has acted as Plaintiff's primary caregiver. The Judge declines to approve the compromise without determining the distribution of all the settlement funds. The Judge orders the Petitioner to give notice of this ruling and to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within five days.
