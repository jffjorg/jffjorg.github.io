English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the motion for a protective order filed by Super Center Concepts, Inc. dba Superior Grocers, limiting the inspection of their premises to between 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. on a Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, or Friday. The court finds good cause for this limitation, as the inspection would otherwise cause disruption and impose undue burden on the defendant. The court also denies both parties' requests for sanctions, finding that the defendant's request for $707.50 is unjust. The ruling concludes that the inspection will take place on the agreed-upon dates and times, and the parties are ordered to notify the court of this ruling.
