LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Inspection demand 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 provides: 
“If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
following rules shall apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party making the demand may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. 
“(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order compelling
a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in
addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(d) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent
exceptional circumstances, the court shall not impose sanctions on a party or
any attorney of a party for failure to provide electronically stored
information that has been lost, damaged, altered, or overwritten as a result of
the routine, good faith operation of an electronic information system. 
“(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter
any obligation to preserve discoverable information.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300.) 
B.   Interrogatories 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides: 
“If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails
to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may
move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition
of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that
sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.) 
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff
argues that on August 29, 2023, he served demands for inspection and
copying, set one, and form interrogatories, set one, on Super T.  Super T did not provide timely responses and
had not provided responses by the time Plaintiff filed these motions on March
19, 2024.  Plaintiff argues the Court should
therefore compel Super T’s responses, without objections, to these discovery requests. 
In
response, Super T argues that (1) it was in default when Plaintiff served the discovery
requests and therefore the service was improper, (2) Plaintiff failed to
confirm the electronic service address of Service T’s counsel before
electronically serving the discovery requests, making the service ineffective,
and (3) Plaintiff failed to meet and confer before filing these motions,
entitling Super T to sanctions. 
The Court
denies Plaintiff’s motions to compel. 
Super T was in default from August 15, 2023 to September 1, 2023.  Plaintiff attempted to serve the discovery
requests on August 29, 2023, while Super T was in default.  As a result, the service was not effective
and Super T was not required to respond to the discovery which Plaintiff
attempted to serve on August 29, 2024. 
The Court grants sanctions against Plaintiff based on Code of Civil Procedure sections 2031.300, subdivision (c), and 2030.290, subdivision (c).  Super
T requests sanctions of $1,750.00 on each motion apparently based on five hours
of attorney time at a rate of $350.00 per hour. 
The Court grants $750.00 in sanctions on both motions based on three
hours of attorney time at a reasonable rate of $250.00 per hour. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES Plaintiff Elias Acevedo Holguin’s motion to compel
responses to demands for inspection and copying, set one. 
The Court DENIES Plaintiff Elias Acevedo Holguin’s
motion to compel responses to form interrogatories, set one. 
The Court DENIES Plaintiff Elias Acevedo Holguin’s requests
for sanctions. 
The Court GRANTS IN PART Defendant Super T
Transport, Inc.’s requests for sanctions and orders Plaintiff Elias Acevedo
Holguin and his counsel to pay Defendant Super T Transport, Inc. $750.00 by May
20, 2024.  In all other respects, the Court DENIES Defendant Super T Transport, Inc.'s requests for sanctions.
