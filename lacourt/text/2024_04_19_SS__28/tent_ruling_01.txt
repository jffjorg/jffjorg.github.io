  Case Number:  21STCV47154    Hearing Date:   April 19, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
December 28, 2021, Plaintiff Saghar Yadegar, by and through her guardian ad
litem Samira Yadegar (“Plaintiff”), filed this action against Defendants Nestor
R. Gonzalez, M.D. (“Gonzalez”), Zachary Barnard, M.D. (“Barnard”), Cedars-Sinai
Health System (“Cedars-Sinai”), and Does 1-50 for medical negligence. 
On
May 17, 2022, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint. 
On
June 20, 2022, Gonzalez and Cedars-Sinai filed an answer. 
On
June 21, 2022, the Court dismissed Barnard with prejudice at Plaintiff’s
request. On December 28, 2023, the Court dismissed Gonzalez with prejudice at
Plaintiff’s request. 
On
August 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed a notice of settlement. 
On
January 19, 2024, Petitioner Samira Yadegar (Petitioner) filed a revised
petition to approve the compromise of a claim of a person with a disability,
set for February 8, 2024. 
On
February 8, 2024, the Court heard argument and continued the matter to March
18, 2024. 
On
February 29 and March 13, 2024, Petitioner filed supplements to the revised
petition. 
On
March 18, 2024, the Court continued the hearing on the revised petition to April 19, 2024.  The Court ordered Petitioner’s counsel to
file a supplemental declaration concerning the outcome of a Probate
Court hearing scheduled for April 12, 2024 in Plaintiff’s conservatorship case. 
No
trial date is currently scheduled. 
PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
asks the Court to approve the compromise of the pending action of Plaintiff
Saghar Yadegar. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
The
parties to a lawsuit may settle the claim of a person who lacks the capacity to
make decisions only with court approval.  (Prob. Code., §§ 2504, 3500, 3600 et seq.;
Code Civ. Proc., § 372; see Pearson v. Superior Court (2012) 202
Cal.App.4th 1333, 1337.) 
A
petition for court approval of a compromise or covenant not to sue under Code
of Civil Procedure section 372 must comply with California Rules of Court,
rules 7.950, 7.951 and 7.952. The petition must be verified by the petitioner
and contain a full disclosure of all information that has “any bearing upon the
reasonableness” of the compromise or the covenant. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
7.950.) 
The
person compromising the claim on behalf of the person who lacks capacity, and
the represented person, must attend the hearing on compromise of the claim
unless the court for good cause dispenses with their personal appearance. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 7.952.) 
DISCUSSION 
A.   Civil Code section 3333.1 
          Petitioner asserts that Civil Code section 3333.1 (“§ 3333.1”)
applies to all the medical care which Plaintiff has received as a result of
Defendants’ alleged negligence.  Blue
Shield of California paid for Plaintiff’s extensive medical care. Petitioner
states that Plaintiff has not received Medi-Cal or Medicare benefits in
connection with her injuries and she is not the beneficiary of a self-funded
ERISA plan.  No other insurance plan has
paid for Plaintiff’s care and no providers have rendered care related to
Plaintiff’s injuries on the promise of future payment specifically from
Plaintiff’s recovery, e.g. on a lien basis. (Verified Supplement to Revised
Petition for Compromise of Claim pp. 2-4; see Z. Haning et al., Cal. Practice
Guide: Personal Injury (Rutter 2023) ¶¶ 3:2050 – 3:2068, pp. 3-394 to 398 (Cal.
Practice Guide: Personal Injury).)   
          “The § 3333.1 reimbursement/subrogation bar applies
whenever plaintiffs have ‘demonstrably’ had their damages recovery ‘reduced to
reflect [§ 3333.1] collateral source contributions’ . . . notwithstanding that
there was no trial, no evidence of collateral source benefits introduced, and
no jury consideration of the issue. 
Thus, a damages recovery by pretrial settlement triggers the bar when it
is shown that the settlement sum excluded compensation for losses paid by the
collateral source provider.”  (Cal.
Practice Guide: Personal Injury, supra, ¶ 3:2068, p. 3-397; see Graham
v. WCAB (1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 499, 508.)    
          Petitioner has provided a June 24, 2022 letter from The
Rawlings Company’s subrogation division stating: “As you know, we are writing
on behalf of Blue Shield of California. 
We are closing this file and are no longer pursuing this matter.”  The letter suggests that the settlement
amount does not include compensation for losses paid by Blue
Shield of California; if it did, The Rawlings Company presumably would pursue
reimbursement of those payments. 
          Based on Petitioner’s supplemental filing, it appears that
under Civil Code section 3333.1, Plaintiff’s medical expenses need not be
reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. 
B.   Conservatorship case 
Petitioner’s
March 13, 2024 supplemental filing states that on February 29, 2024, Petitioner
filed (1) a Petition to Authorize Conservator to Marshal Assets Resulting From
Compromise of Medical Malpractice Settlement, (2) a Petition for Order to File
Bond for Conservator, (3) a Petition to Invest in Mutual Funds and U.S.
Government Bonds with Maturity Dates Later than Five Years, and (4) a Petition
to Set Review Hearing Date for Filing of the First and Current Account of
Conservator in the conservatorship case, Los Angeles Superior Court Case No.
21STPB11784. The hearing on the petitions was scheduled for April 12, 2024 in
Department ST62. 
In light
of the April 12, 2024 date for the conservatorship petitions, on March 18, 2024
the Court continued the hearing on the petition to approve the compromise of
Plaintiff’s claim to April 19, 2024.  The
Court ordered Petitioner’s counsel to file a supplemental declaration or other
pleading addressing the Probate Court’s rulings. 
Petitioner
has not yet filed a supplemental declaration or pleading describing the Probate
Court’s rulings.  Therefore, the Court
will continue the hearing once again. 
C.   Proposed payment of $250,000.00 to Petitioner 
Petitioner
argues that Plaintiff has the right to the reasonable value of nursing services
required by the Defendants’ tortious conduct even if a family member provided
the services without an agreement or expectation of payment.  According to Petitioner, “[w]here services in
the way of attendance and nursing are rendered by a member of the plaintiff's
family, the amount for which the defendant is liable is the amount for which
reasonably competent nursing and attendance by others could have been obtained.”  (Verified Supplement to Revised Petition for
Compromise of Claim p. 6, citing Hanif v. Housing Authority (1988) 200
Cal.App.3d 635, 644-645.)  Petitioner
acknowledges that the right belongs to Plaintiff, not Petitioner. 
Petitioner
nonetheless argues that it is appropriate to pay her $250,000.00 out of the settlement funds because she
has acted as Plaintiff’s primary caregiver since July 13, 2021 and assists with
essentially all of Plaintiff’s activities of daily living. 
Petitioner
also argues that the Court hearing this civil matter may approve the requested
compensation rather than the Court hearing the conservatorship case.  Petitioner
concedes that Probate Code section 2641 would require the conservatorship Court
to address the issue if the settlement funds were “currently within the
[conservatorship].”  Petitioner argues, however, that “the present
situation is distinguishable in that it involves a settlement arising out of
civil litigation and that payment is not being requested from the
conservatorship assets, but rather from the settlement funds being tendered by
Defendant Cedars-Sinai Health System.” 
The
Court greatly appreciates Petitioner’s services to Plaintiff.  However, the Court that is hearing the
conservatorship case should consider the request to transfer $250,000.00 of Plaintiff's assets to Petitioner, who is also Plaintiff's conservator. 
Anticipating
that the Court might defer to the Probate Court on this issue, Petitioner asks
the Court to “carve out” the proposed $250,000.00 payment to Petitioner and
approve the revised petition “such that the remainder of the compromise process
may go forward, including the funding of annuities, payments of legal fees and
expenses in [connection] with the medical negligence case, and the lump sum
payment of the remaining net proceeds to the conservatorship estate.”  Petitioner asks that the Court allow $250,000.00
to “remain in Plaintiff’s counsel’s trust account pending final judicial
determinations, not unlike when there is a disputed lien pending resolution.” 
The
Court declines to approve the compromise of Plaintiff’s action without
determining the distribution of all the settlement funds. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court CONTINUES the hearing on the revised petition to approve the compromise
of Plaintiff Saghar Yadegar’s claims filed by Petitioner Samira Yadegar on January
19, 2024, as supplemented by Petitioner’s February
29, 2024 and March 13, 2024 filings.  The
Court will provide a continued hearing date at the April 19, 2024 hearing. 
Petitioner
is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within
five days.
