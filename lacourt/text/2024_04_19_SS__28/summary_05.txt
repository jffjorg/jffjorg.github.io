And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has considered the moving papers, oppositions, and replies in this case. The Court rules as follows.

The Plaintiff, Elias Acevedo Holguin, filed this action against the Defendants, including Bryan James Hammer, Super T Transport, Inc., and others, alleging battery and negligence. The Defendants have raised various objections and counterclaims.

The Plaintiff has moved to compel Super T to respond to demands for inspection and copying, set one, and form interrogatories, set one. The Plaintiff has also moved to compel responses to these discovery requests. The Court denies these motions.

The Court finds that the service of the discovery requests was ineffective because Super T was in default from August 15, 2023, to September 1, 2023. The Court grants sanctions against the Plaintiff in the amount of $750.00, based on three hours of attorney time at a reasonable rate of $250.00 per hour.

The Court denies the Plaintiff's requests for sanctions. The Court grants in part the Defendant's requests for sanctions and orders the Plaintiff to pay the Defendant $750.00 by May 20, 2024.
