And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of a petition for a name change. The petitioner has failed to provide any form of identification tied to a fingerprint on file, which is necessary for probation to run a criminal history assessment. The judge has ordered the petitioner to provide probation with some form of identification verified by a fingerprint to enable probation to run the assessment. The petitioner may do this by providing a California driver's license number or California ID number, a driver's license number or DMV-issued ID number from another state, or by contacting probation to arrange for fingerprints to be taken. The petition is continued to January 22, 2024, at 9 am, to give the petitioner time to provide the necessary information. If the petitioner fails to provide sufficient information prior to the next hearing date, the petition will be denied and dismissed without prejudice.
