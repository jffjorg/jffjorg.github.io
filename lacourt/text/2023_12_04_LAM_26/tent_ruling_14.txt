  Case No.:  23STCV03367
 
 
  Hearing Date: December 4, 2023
 
[TENTATIVE] order RE:
plaintiffs’ motion for trial preference



 
Procedural Background
            On February 15, 2023, Plaintiffs
Lucy West and Harold West (jointly “Plaintiffs”) filed the instant action for fraud
and elder abuse against Defendants Elite Home Remodeling, Inc. (“Elite”) and
Solar Mosaic, LLC (“Mosaic”) (jointly “Defendants”).  On March 27, 2023, Elite filed a cross-complaint
against Plaintiffs and Deon West for breach of contract.
            On May 23, 2023, Plaintiffs filed
the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against Defendants.  The FAC asserts nine causes of action for (1)
Fraudulent Misrepresentation, (2) Fraudulent Concealment, (3) Negligence, (4)
Violations of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act, (5) Violations of the Rosenthal
Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, (6) Violations of the Elder Abuse and
Dependent Adult Civil Protection Act, (7) Violations of the Home Solicitation
Sales Act, (8) Violation of Business and Professions Code § 7150, et seq.,
and (9) Violations of the Unfair Competition Law.  
            On June 21, 2023, Defendant Solar
Mosaic LLC filed a motion to compel arbitration.[1]
            Approximately three months later --
on September 20, 2023 -- Plaintiffs filed the instant motion for trial
preference under Code of Civil Procedure section 36.  
On
November 3, 2023, the Court denied Defendant Mosaic’s motion to compel
arbitration and advanced the instant motion for trial preference to December 4,
2023.  (Order 11/3/23.)  On November 13, 2023, Defendant Mosaic filed
a notice of appeal of the November 3, 2023 Order denying arbitration.
            On November 27, 2023, Plaintiffs
filed a reply.
 
Automatic Stay
During an Appeal
            “Under [Code of Civil Procedure]
section 916, ‘the trial court is divested of’ subject matter jurisdiction over
any matter embraced in or affected by the appeal during the pendency of that
appeal.”  (Varian Medical Systems,
Inc. v. Delfino (2005) 35 Cal.4th 180, 196–197.) “The purpose of the
automatic stay under section 916 is to preserve ‘the status quo until the
appeal is decided’ [Citation], by maintaining 'the rights of the parties in the
same condition they were before the order was made[.]” [Citation]. Otherwise,
the trial court could render the ‘appeal futile by altering the appealed
judgment or order by conducting other proceedings that may affect it.’”  (Id. at p.198.)  
            “Here [Defendant Mosaic] appealed
the order denying arbitration. That appeal affects the entire case. Thus,
further trial court proceedings are stayed under Code of Civil Procedure
section 916.”  (Prudential-Bache
Securities, Inc. v. Superior Court (1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 924, 925.)  Therefore, the Court cannot set a trial date
or entertain any further proceedings until the remittitur issues.  Accordingly, as the instant action is stayed
in its entirety pending the appeal, the Court cannot issue an order setting the
instant action for trial preference under Code of Civil Procedure section 36.
 
Conclusion and ORDER
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiffs Lucy West and
Harold West’s motion for
trial preference is CONTINUED to July 25, 2024 at 8:30 am pending issuance of
the remittitur of the appeal.
A status conference re Status of the
Appeal is set for July 1, 2024 at 8:30 am.
If a remittitur issues prior to the July
1, 2024 status conference, either party may bring an ex parte application to
advance the status conference to an earlier date.
Moving Parties are to give notice and
file proof of service of such.
