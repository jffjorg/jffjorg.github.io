The judge has tentatively ruled to continue the petition to January 29, 2024, at 9:00 am. The reason for the continuance is that the petitioner has failed to file proof of service of the petition on the other parent, Edgar Jimenez. The judge has ordered the petitioner to file proof of service or a declaration explaining why they are unable to serve Edgar Jimenez, who is identified as the father on the minor's birth certificate. The petitioner may also file documentation supporting their claim that Edgar Jimenez is not the biological father of the minor. The petitioner must file this documentation or declaration 10 days prior to the continued hearing.
