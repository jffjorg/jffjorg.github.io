And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the petition without prejudice due to the Petitioner's failure to provide identification tied to a fingerprint, which is necessary for Probation to run a criminal history assessment. The Court previously continued the petition on October 16, 2023, and ordered the Petitioner to provide identification, but the Petitioner failed to do so. The Judge is requiring the Petitioner to submit a new petition addressing the lack of identification before the Court will consider the petition further.
