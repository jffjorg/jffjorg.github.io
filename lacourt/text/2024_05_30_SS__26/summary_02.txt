And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling sustains the demurrer filed by the defendants (Joel Rodney Mason, Delores Marie Allen, and Aldina Washington) to the complaint filed by the plaintiff (William Lee Scott, Sr.). The complaint alleges causes of action for breach of contract and common counts. However, the court finds that the complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to state a cause of action against the moving defendants. The court also denies the plaintiff's request for leave to amend the complaint. The court's decision is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and several California court decisions.
