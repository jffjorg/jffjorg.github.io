Law Offices of Stephen L. Cawelti, APC v. Casentini,
IV, et al.MOTION TO STRIKE ANSWER
(CCP §§ 436, 431.30)
TENTATIVE RULING: 
 
Plaintiff Law Offices of Stephen L. Cawelti, APC’s Motion to
Strike Answer is DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
On January 10, 2023, Plaintiff Law Offices of Stephen L.
Cawelti (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action for breach of retainer agreement
against Defendant Michael J. Casentini, IV (“Defendant”). Defendant filed an
answer to the Complaint on November 19, 2023. 
 
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Strike Answer on March
19, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
The Motion to Strike is
procedurally defective. First, the Motion is not accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 435.5. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 435.5, subd. (a) [“Before filing a motion to strike pursuant to
this chapter, the moving party shall meet and confer in person, by telephone,
or by video conference with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to
the motion to strike for the purpose of determining if an agreement can be
reached that resolves the objections to be raised in the motion to strike.”].) 
 
Second, a motion to strike in a
court of limited jurisdiction may only be brought on the grounds that “the
damages or relief sought are not supported by the allegations of the complaint.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 92, subd. (d).) The instant Motion to Strike is based on
the grounds that Defendant’s answer does not contain a general or specific
denial and does not contain a statement of any new matter constituting a
defense. (Motion, pp. 1-3.) This is not a permissible basis to strike the
answer in the limited jurisdiction court. 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Law Offices of Stephen L. Cawelti, APC’s Motion to
Strike Answer is DENIED.
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
