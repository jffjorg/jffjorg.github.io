And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to strike the defendant's answer. The plaintiff's motion is procedurally defective because it lacks a meet and confer declaration, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 435.5. Additionally, the motion is based on grounds that are not permitted in a court of limited jurisdiction, as specified in Code of Civil Procedure section 92. The defendant's answer does not contain a general or specific denial and does not contain a statement of any new matter constituting a defense, which is not a permissible basis to strike the answer in the limited jurisdiction court.
