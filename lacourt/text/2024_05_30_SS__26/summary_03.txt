significant_statements:
  - "An interpleader action is traditionally viewed as two suits: one between the stakeholder and the claimants to determine the stakeholder's right to interplead, and the other among the claimants to determine who shall receive the funds interpleaded ... As against the stakeholder, claimants may raise only matters which go to whether the suit is properly one for interpleader; i.e., whether the elements of an interpleader action are present." (State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. Pietak (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 600, 612)
