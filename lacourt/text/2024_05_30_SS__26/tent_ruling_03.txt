ANALYSIS:
 
On August 1, 2023,
Plaintiff Ticor Title Company of California (“Plaintiff”) initiated this interpleader
action against Defendants Willowbrook
Restaurant, LLC and Xen Restaurant, LLC (“Defendants”). Following their failure
to file responsive pleadings, default was entered against both Defendants on February
26, 2024. 
 
Plaintiff
filed the instant Motion to Deposit by Stakeholder, for Discharge of
Stakeholder, and Award of Costs and
Escrow Compensation on March 22, 2024. To date, no opposition has
been filed. 
 
Legal Standard
 
Interpleader is a procedure whereby a person holding money
or personal property to which conflicting claims are being or may be made by
others can join the adverse claimants and force them to litigate their claims
among themselves. (Code Civ. Proc., § 386, subd. (b).) Hancock Oil Co. v.
Hopkins (1944) 24 Cal.2d 497, 508 (i.e., an escrow-holder who receives
conflicting demands from the parties to the escrow regarding the funds or
documents he or she holds); City of Morgan Hill v. Brown (1999) 71
Cal.App.4th 1114, 1122.)
 
Once the stakeholder’s right to interplead is established
and he or she deposits the money or personal property in court, he or she may
be discharged from liability to any of the claimants. This enables the
stakeholder to avoid multiplicity of actions, and the risk of inconsistent
results if each of the claimants were to sue him or her separately. (Cantu
v. Resolution Trust Corp. (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 857, 874; City of Morgan
Hill, supra, 71 Cal.App.4th at 1122.)
 
“An interpleader action is traditionally viewed as two
suits: one between the stakeholder and the claimants to determine the
stakeholder's right to interplead, and the other among the claimants to
determine who shall receive the funds interpleaded ... As against the
stakeholder, claimants may raise only matters which go to whether the suit is
properly one for interpleader; i.e., whether the elements of an interpleader
action are present.” (State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. Pietak (2001) 90
Cal.App.4th 600, 612.)
 
The stakeholder may seek reimbursement for its costs and
reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred.  
(UAP-Columbus JV 326132 v. Nesbitt (1991) 234
Cal.App.3d 1028, 1036.) The court may order payment thereof out of the funds
deposited by the stakeholder. (Ibid.) Ultimately, such payment may be
charged to one or more of the adverse claimants in the final judgment. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 386.6.) Finally, the Court may issue an “order restraining all
parties to the action from instituting or further prosecuting any other
proceeding in any court in this state affecting the rights and obligations as
between the parties to the interpleader until further order of the court.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 386, subd. (f).) 
 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff’s request for an order to be discharged from
liability on the Complaint in interpleader is proper. The disputed funds of $15,982.86
were deposited with the Court when the action was filed. All claimants have
been served with the Summons and Complaint and are in default. (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 386 and 386.5.) Currently, Plaintiff cannot determine the validity of
the conflicting demands that have been made. (Motion, Tyler Decl., ¶¶3-7.) Furthermore,
the fees and costs sought by Plaintiff are proper except for those regarding an
anticipated reply, as the Motion is unopposed. Plaintiff’s counsel filed the
instant action, deposited the funds, served and defaulted Defendants, prepared
the instant Motion, and will appear at the instant hearing. (Id. at Exh.
1.) Therefore, attorney’s fees are awarded to Plaintiff in the amount of $6,119.00.
(Ibid.) Costs are awarded in the amount of $769.33 based on a reduction
of $19.72 for legal research, which the Court will not award. (Ibid.)
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Ticor Title Company of California’s Motion for Discharge, and
Award of Attorney’s Fees and Costs is GRANTED. PLAINTIFF IS AWARDED ATTORNEY’S
FEES OF $6,119.00 AND COSTS OF $769.33.
