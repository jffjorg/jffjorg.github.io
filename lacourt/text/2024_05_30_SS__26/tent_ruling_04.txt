ANALYSIS:
 
On January 12, 2024, Petitioner Shawn Liu (“Petitioner”)
filed the instant Petition to Correct Arbitration Award against Respondent Lach
Tach (“Respondent”). Respondent filed a response in the form of a Petition to
Correct and Confirm Arbitration Award, and Cross-Complaint on May 9, 2024. 
 
Discussion
 
Before the Court can reach the merits of the Petitions,
several procedural matters must be addressed. First, the Petition to Correct is
brought by Petitioner with respect to an arbitration award issued against Glamscape,
Inc. (Pet., Attachment 8(c).) Petitioner, therefore, is not a party named in
the arbitration proceeding. Even if the Petition were on behalf of Glamscape,
Inc., it is black letter law that a corporation cannot represent itself in
court. (Clean Air Transport Systems v. San Mateo County Transit Dist.
(1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 576, 578 (citing Merco Constr. Engineers, Inc. v.
Municipal Court (1978) 21 Cal.3d 724, 729-730).) This rule applies to all
entities regarded as separate from their owners, including partnerships and
unincorporated associations. (See Clean Air Transport Systems, supra, 19
Cal.App.3d at 578.) Glamscape, Inc. filed the Petition without proper legal
representation, and it must appear through an attorney going forward. 
 
As an aside, the Court will not address Respondent’s
arguments regarding the correct parties to the arbitration award at this time.
 
Second, Respondent’s joint Petition to Correct and Confirm
Arbitration Award, and Cross-Complaint are not accompanied by a proof of
service demonstrating it was served on Petitioner. Also, a response that seeks to vacate or correct the
award must be served and filed no later than 100 days after the date of the
service of a signed copy of the award on the moving party. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
1290.6, 1288.2.) The award was served on Respondent on October 17, 2023, making
the deadline to file and serve a petition to correct the arbitration award was
January 25, 2024. This deadline, however, is subject to equitable tolling in
exceptional circumstances. (Law Finance Group, LLC v. Key (2023) 14
Cal.5th 932, 960.) Grounds for such tolling must be determined to exist by the
Court upon a showing by Respondent before the Court will consider the
responsive Petition to Correct.
 
Finally,
Respondent’s inclusion of a Cross-Complaint in their response to the Petition
is improper. A cross-complaint may only be filed by “[a] party against whom a
cause of action has been asserted in a complaint or cross-complaint  . . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 428.10.) No
complaint or cross-complaint has been filed in this action asserting a cause of
action against Respondent. Therefore, Respondent cannot file a cross-complaint
in this action. On its own motion, the Court strikes Respondent’s Cross-Complaint.
(See Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd. (b).) 
 
Conclusion
 
THE COURT SETS AN ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE REGARDING LEGAL
REPRESENTATION OF GLAMSCAPE, INC. ON AUGUST 29, 2024 AT 9:30 AM IN DEPARTMENT
26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE. 
 
A NEW HEARING DATE ON THE INSTANT PETITION TO CORRECT
ARBITRATION AWARD AND RESPONSIVE PETITION IS TO BE DETERMINED FOLLOWING THE
ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE.
