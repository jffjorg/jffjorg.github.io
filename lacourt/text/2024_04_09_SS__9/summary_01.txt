And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has posted a tentative ruling for the April 9, 2024 hearing on the plaintiff's motion for final approval of the class action settlement. The court is inclined to grant final approval, but counsel must address certain issues before the court can make a final decision. Specifically, counsel must provide an updated declaration from the named plaintiff, which must include quantification of time and effort expended on the case and a reasoned explanation of financial or other risks incurred by the named plaintiff. Additionally, counsel must explain why there are almost 200 fewer Aggrieved Employees than anticipated at preliminary approval. The court is also seeking clarification on certain costs, including the "Admin Fee" of $750. If counsel cures the above defects by filing and serving supplemental evidence by 11 am on April 8, 2024, the court will review the supplemental materials before the April 9, 2024 hearing. Otherwise, the court will continue the hearing accordingly.
