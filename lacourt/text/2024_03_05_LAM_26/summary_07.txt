And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the default judgment submitted by the plaintiff due to several defects. The plaintiff failed to submit a properly completed CIV-100 form requesting a default judgment, and did not provide sufficient evidence to support the amount of damages claimed, including post-termination loss of earnings, statutory wait time damages, and emotional distress damages. Additionally, the plaintiff's request for attorney's fees was not calculated in accordance with LASC Rule 3.214. The judge has given the plaintiff until April 9, 2024 to submit a new default judgment package correcting these defects. Failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal.
