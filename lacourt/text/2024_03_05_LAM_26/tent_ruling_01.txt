[TENTATIVE] order RE:
Plaintiff
Coachella Valley Water District’s
  motion to compel compliance with agreement to produce responsive documents



 
Procedural Background
            On January 5,
2022, Plaintiff Coachella Valley Water District (“CVWD”) filed the instant
breach of contract action against Defendant Imperial Irrigation District
(“IID”).  On August 4, 2023, CVWD filed
the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against IID.  The FAC asserts four causes of action for (1)
Declaratory Relief, (2) Breach of Contract, (3) Accounting, and (4) Breach of
Fiduciary Duty.
            On February 6, 2024, CVWD filed the instant
motion to compel IID’s compliance with its agreement to produce all documents responsive
to CVWD’s first, second, and supplemental Requests for Production of Documents
(“RPDs”).  On February 21, 2024, IID
filed an opposition.  On February 27,
2024, CVWD filed a reply.
 
Legal Standard
            
Monetary Sanctions for Failing to Comply with a Court Order
Code of Civil Procedure
section 2023.030 provides that, “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter
governing any particular discovery method . . . , the court, after notice to
any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may
impose . . . [monetary, issue, evidence, or terminating] sanctions against
anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process . . .
.”  Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.010 provides that “[m]issues of the discovery process include, but are not
limited to, the following: . . . (d) Failing to respond or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery. . . . (g) Disobeying a court order to provide
discovery . . . .”
 
Motion to Compel Compliance
            Pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 2031.320(a), “[i]f a party filing a response to a
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling under Sections 2031.210,
2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280 thereafter fails to permit the
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling in accordance with that party's
statement of compliance, the demanding party may move for an order compelling
compliance.”  (CCP § 2031.320(a).)
 
Discussion
            On February 14, 2022,
CVWD served RPDs, Set One Nos. 1-2.  (Bakaly
IV Decl. ¶ 4.)  On March 21, 2022, IID
served its initial responses to the RPDs, Set One.  (Bakaly IV Decl. ¶ 4.)  On October 4, 2022, CVWD served RPDs, Set Two
Nos. 3-76.  (Bakaly IV Decl. ¶ 4.)  On November 11, 2022, IID served its initial
responses to the RPDs, Set Two.  (Bakaly
IV Decl. ¶ 4.)  
            On January 23, 2023 – in
response to a pending motion to compel further responses – IID served
supplemental responses agreeing to produce all documents responsive to RPDs No.
1-39, 41-61, and 63-76.  (Bakaly IV Decl.
¶ 5; see also Order 11/1/23 at p.2:10-13.)  However, IID failed to produce all responsive
documents in compliance with its supplemental responses to the RPDs Set One and
Set Two.  (Bakaly IV Decl. ¶ 6.)  Accordingly, on July 10, 2023, CVWD moved to
compel IID’s compliance with its supplemental responses agreeing to produce all
documents responsive to RPDs No. 1-39, 41-61, and 63-76.  (Bakaly IV Decl. ¶ 7.)
            Before the initial
hearing for CVWD’s motion, on August 1, 2023, IID represented that, due to the
number of documents, it may take up until November 2023 to go through and
produce all of the responsive documents. 
(Minute Order 8/1/23; see also Order 11/1/23 at p.2:15-17.)  Accordingly, the Court continued the motion
to be heard on November 1, 2023.  (Minute
Order 8/1/23; see also Order 11/1/23 at p.2:17-19.)  
            In addition, on August
1, 2023, the parties stipulated to the filing of the FAC which would add the
years 2021 and 2022 to the parties’ dispute regarding the net proceeds arising from
1934 Compromise Agreement between CVWD and IID. 
(Griffin Decl. ¶ 6, Exh. 5.)  On
October 2, 2023, CVWD served supplemental RPDs asking IID to produce additional
documents for the years 2021 and 2022.  (Bakaly
IV Decl. ¶ 8; Griffin Decl. ¶ 7.)  
            On November 1, 2023, as
the documents responsive to RPDs No. 1-39, 41-61, and 63-76 had not been
produced in compliance with IID’s response, the Court ordered IID to produce
the responsive documents within thirty days of notice of the order and for CVWD
to give notice.  (Order 11/1/23 at
p.3:2-6; Bakaly IV Decl. ¶ 9, Exh. B; Griffin Decl. ¶ 5.)  On November 2, 2023, CVWD gave notice on IID by
electronic service of the Court’s November 1, 2023 Order.  (Bakaly IV Decl. ¶ 9, Exh. C.)  
            On November 3, 2023, IID
served responses to the Supplemental RPDs agreeing to produce documents. (Bakaly
IV Decl. ¶ 10, Exh. D; Griffin Decl. ¶ 7, Exh. 6.)  On November 14, 2023, CVWD’s Counsel emailed
IID’s Counsel for clarification on the responses to the Supplemental RPDs.  (Bakaly IV Decl. ¶ 11, Exh. E.)  On November 21, 2023, IID’s Counsel clarified
that for the Supplemental RPDs, “where [IID] agreed to produce documents, it
will be for all years at issue.”  (Bakaly
IV Decl. ¶ 11, Exh. E.)  
            On November 30, 2023,
IID’s Counsel emailed CVWD’s Counsel to tell them that a sizable production was
coming on December 4, 2023 and inquired whether CVWD would agree to extend the deadline
to produce the deadline by two weeks to make it a rolling production, and that it
was working on the Net Proceeds Statement for 2022 and would be producing it as
soon as possible.  (Bakaly IV Decl. ¶ 11,
Exh. E.)  On December 4, 2023, CVWD’s
Counsel responded by email, denying the request for two additional weeks on the
grounds that that IID had requested the additional two weeks at the November 1,
2023 hearing, and the Court denied it.  (Bakaly
IV Decl. ¶ 11, Exh. E.)
            On December 4, 2023, IID
served approximately 545,201 documents. 
(Bakaly IV Decl. ¶ 12.)  On
December 19, 2023, CVWD’s Counsel sent a meet and confer letter noting that
CVWD could not confirm if IID had produced all the documents because IID had
failed to serve a production log and failed to confirm whether all the
documents had been produced.  (Bakaly IV
Decl. ¶ 13, Exh. F.)  On January 4, 2024,
IID served a response including the production log and claimed that all the
documents had been produced.  (Bakaly IV
Decl. ¶ 14, Exhs. G-H.)  IID also noted
that it anticipated producing documents requested in the Supplemental RPDs no
later than January 31, 2024.  (Bakaly IV
Decl. ¶ 14, Exh. G.)  On January 26,
2024, CVWD’s Counsel sent an email noting that CVWD still needed (1) the 2022
General Ledger; (2) general ledger trial balances for 2022; (3) the 2022 GL
Financial Statement Mapping, and (4) the 2022 Net Proceeds Statement.  (Bakaly IV Decl. ¶ 15, Exh. I.)  CVWD’s Counsel further requested that IID
confirm that all outstanding documents would be produced by January 31,
2024.  (Bakaly IV Decl. ¶ 15, Exh. I.)
            CVWD’s Counsel attempted
to contact IID’s Counsel by phone between February 1 and February 5, 2024 but
did not receive a response.  (Bakaly IV
Decl. ¶ 16.)  As IID’s Counsel notes, CVWD’s
Counsel only called once on February 5, 2024 when IID’s Counsel was out of
office, and CVWD’s Counsel’s voicemail did not refer to any potential discovery
motion.  (Griffin Decl. ¶ 11.)  
            CVWD contends that (1) IID
violated the November 1, 2023 Order and that (2) IID failed to produce
documents compliant with its response to the Supplemental RPDs.  
 
Failure to Comply with the November 1, 2023 Order 
            CVWD contends that IID
violated the November 1, 2023 Order by not producing the documents until
December 4, 2023 and by not including the 2021 and 2022 related documents in
the initial production.  
            The November 1, 2023
Order ordered IID to produce documents compliant with IID’s responses RPDs No.
1-39, 41-61, and 63-76 “within thirty (30) days of notice of th[e] order[,]” and ordered CVWD to give notice.  (Order 11/1/23 at p.3:5-6, [Bold, Italics,
Underline Added].)  As noted above, CVWD
gave notice by electronic service on November 2, 2023.  (Bakaly IV Decl. ¶ 9, Exh. C.)  As notice was provided by electronic service,
the deadline to comply with the Order was extended by two court days.  (CCP § 1010.6.)  Therefore, IID had until December 5, 2023 to
timely produce the requested documents. 
            Moreover, the failure to
include the 2021 and 2022 related documents does not violate the November 1,
2023 Order.  The November 1, 2023 Order
merely granted the requests specified in CVWD’s July 10, 2023 motion – which
was before the parties stipulated to expand the action to include the
net proceeds from 2021 and 2022.  Thus,
the November 1, 2023 Order did not encompass documents beyond those requested
in the original July 10, 2023 motion – i.e., documents up to 2020.  
            However, IID did fail to
comply with the November 1, 2023 Order in another aspect.  Though a “production log” is not necessarily
required – nor was it specified in the November 1, 2023 Order – a party cannot
merely provide a large quantity of unidentified documents.  Rather, “[a]ny documents … produced in
response to a [RPD] shall be identified with the specific request number to which the documents
respond.”  (CCP § 2031.280(a), [Bold,
Italics, Underline Added].)  Thus, it is
essential that the produced documents clearly identify the RPD to which each document
is responsive in some manner such as a production log.  
            Here, it is clear that
the December 4, 2023 Document production did not identify which documents were
responsive to each specific RPD.  (See
e.g., Bakaly IV Decl. ¶ 13, Exh. F.) 
It was not until January 4, 2024 – a month later – that a production log
identifying the specific responsive documents was produced.  (Bakaly IV Decl. ¶ 14, Exh. H.)  Therefore, IID failed to comply with the
November 1, 2023 Order by failing to timely identify the documents responsive
to each request as required with a code compliant production of documents.  
 
Compel Compliance with the Response to the Supplemental RPD
            As the moving papers
note, CVWD contends that an order compelling compliance is warranted because
IID failed to produce (1) the 2022 General Ledger; (2) general ledger trial
balances for 2022; (3) the 2022 GL Financial Statement Mapping, and (4) the
2022 Net Proceeds Statement.   
Here, the supplemental RPD requested that:
 
Please review each of your responses to all [RPD]s previously served on
you in this action by CVWD, and if, for any reason (including, but not limited
to, the parties' stipulation and order authorizing the filing of CVWD's First
Amended Complaint expanding this case to include the years 2020 and 2021) any response is no longer correct and complete, identify the response,
produce any and all additional documents, and state whatever information is
necessary to make it correct and complete as of this date. In supplementing
responses to the [RPD]s, IID shall furnish all responsive documents and/or
information available to IID from any source, including, but not limited to,
IID's knowledge and any documents and/or information that can be acquired
through a diligent search of records, statements, and other documents in IID's
possession, custody or control.
(Bakaly IV Decl. ¶ 10, Exh. D, [Bold, Italics, Underline Added].)
In response, IID stated that:
 
Responding Party objects to this Supplemental Request by incorporating
the above General Objections, as well as its objections to each of the prior
Requests for Production previously served by Propounding Party, as though fully
set forth herein. Responding Party further objects on the grounds that this
Supplemental Request goes beyond the scope of CCP § 2031.050, and because a
significant amount of time is necessary to assess and review relevant records
and produce documents, if any, that are responsive to this Supplemental
Request, additional time may be needed to complete this process. Without
waiving the foregoing objections, Responding Party responds as follows: 
 
Responding Party will review its prior responses to Propounding Party's
Requests for Production, and will produce, for those specific Requests where
Responding Party has agreed to produce documents, any later acquired or
discovered non-privileged documents responsive to such Requests in its
possession, custody, or control to the extent that such documents have not
already been produced.
(Bakaly IV Decl. ¶ 10, Exh. D.)
            In relevant part, the
Supplemental RPD only requests documents from 2020 through 2021, and the
verified response only identifies that IID will produce responsive documents up
to that date.  While this may be a
typographical error, and the parties informally agreed in emails that “where
[IID] agreed to produce documents, it will be for all years at issue[,]” (Bakaly
IV Decl. ¶ 11, Exh. E), the formal verified response only identifies the
request as requiring production through the years 2020 and 2021.  Thus, IID’s failure to produce documents from
2022 did not violate its verified response. 
The Court can only compel produce compliant with the response. (CCP § 2031.320(a).)  The moving papers fails to identify any
documents not produced in compliant with IID’s response to the Supplemental
RPDs.
            Moreover, many of these
documents have been produced.  “IID
produced its 2022 Trial Balances and Financial Statement Mapping on June 16, 2023,
as IID122477.”  (Griffin Decl. ¶ 9.)  Further, after the instant motion was filed, on
February 16, 2024, IID produced the 2022 General Ledger, as IID688954-IID688965.  (Griffin Decl. ¶ 9; Supp. Bakaly IV Decl. ¶ 8.)  Thus, of the documents identified in the
moving papers, only the 2022 Net Proceeds Statement remains outstanding.
 
Reply Contentions
            In reply, CVWD raises
for the first time, that IID failed to produce the 2018-2021 General Ledgers in
native format as requested in the RPD. (Supp. Bakaly IV Decl. ¶ 4.)
            Unless ordered
otherwise, “[i]f a demand for production does not specify a form or forms for
producing a type of electronically stored information, the responding party
shall produce the information in the form or forms in which it is ordinarily
maintained or in a form that is reasonably usable.”  (CCP § 2031.280(d)(1).)  Here, the RPDs at issue specified that the
documents should be produced in native format. 
(Supp. Bakaly IV Decl. ¶ 2, Exh. J.)  Moreover, IID’s responses to the RPDs do not
specify that the documents would be produced in a different format than
requested.  Accordingly, IID was required
to produce the 2018-2021 General Ledgers in native format.  
            CVWD
also notes for the first time in reply that IID failed to produce executed
copies of the following board resolutions: Resolution Nos. 28-2016, 29-2016,
and 30-2016.  (Supp. Bakaly IV Decl. ¶ 7.)  As these would be responsive documents, IID
was required to produce said resolutions. 

            While
these issues raised in the reply are significant, CVWD failed to raise them in
the moving papers as required.  New
arguments and issues cannot be raised in reply as they raise significant due
process concerns.  “To withhold a point
until the closing brief would deprive the [opposing part] of his [or her]
opportunity to answer it or require the effort and delay of an additional brief
by permission. Hence the rule is that points raised in the reply brief for the
first time will not be considered, unless good reason is shown for failure to present
them before.”  (High Sierra Rural
Alliance v. County of Plumas (2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 102, 112, Fn. 2.)
            Accordingly,
sanctions cannot be awarded based on these issues raised in reply.
 
Sanctions
            CVWD
requests sanctions against IID and its counsel of record of $4,644. CVWD’s
Counsel claims to have spent 8.9 hours researching and drafting the instant
motion and another 4 hours on the reply at a claimed billing rate of $360 an
hour.  (Bakaly IV Decl. ¶ 18.)
            “If a party then
fails to obey an order compelling further response [to a request for
production], the court may … impose a monetary sanction under [CCP §
2023.030.]”  (CCP § 2031.310(i).)  Under Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030(a), the court may impose sanction covering the costs of “reasonable
expenses, including attorney’s fees”. 
(CCP § 2023.030(a).)  
            Here,
some sanctions are warranted for failing to timely identify the documents
responsive to each request produced on December 4, 2023 and delaying until January
4, 2024 to serve the production log. 
However, the requested amount of $4,644 is plainly excessive.  Most of the instant motion is
unsupported.  The only identified issue
warranting sanctions had been resolved over a month before the instant was
filed.  Further, the claimed time is
plainly excessive given the simplicity of identifying that IID failed to timely
produce a production log.  Accordingly,
based on the totality of the circumstances sanctions of $1,500 are warranted. 
            Defendant Imperial
Irrigation District and its counsel of record, Allen
Matkins Leck Gamble Mallory & Natsis LLP, are jointly and severally liable
and ordered to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,500.00 to
Plaintiff Coachella Valley Water District by
and through counsel, within thirty (30) days of notice of this order.
