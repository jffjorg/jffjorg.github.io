* The burden is on the party asserting a privacy interest to establish its extent and the seriousness of the prospective invasion.
* Only obvious invasions of interests fundamental to personal autonomy must be supported by a compelling interest.
* The Court may issue sanctions for misuse of the discovery process for failing to meet and confer.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion to quash the subpoena for Lucas Herchenroeder's employment records and has granted the motion in part. The subpoena is modified to only include incident reports, performance appraisals, awards, and requests for medical/sick leave that refer or relate to the named individual, as well as records of any communications to and/or from Lucas Herchenroeder and/or his legal representative. The court finds that the subpoena is overbroad and invasive of Herchenroeder's privacy, but that some relevance is required to support the subpoena. The court also finds that the defendant's request for sanctions is denied due to the mixed result of the motion and the totality of the circumstances.
