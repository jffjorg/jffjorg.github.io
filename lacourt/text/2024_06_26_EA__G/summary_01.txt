This tentative ruling grants Orlando Garcia's application for default judgment against Country Liquor Market 2, Inc. in the reduced amount of $5,353.59. The case involves a disability rights action, with Garcia alleging that Country Liquor's property in Covina has barriers to access. Garcia visited the property for disability access testing and filed a complaint against Hideco Investment LLC, Country Liquor, and Does 1-50 alleging violations of the Unruh Civil Rights Act and the California Disabled Persons Act. Country Liquor failed to file an answer, and the Court entered default against them. The Court finds that Garcia has submitted sufficient evidence and grants his application for default judgment with modifications, reducing the amount of attorney fees and costs requested.
