Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Orlando Garcia’s Application for Default
Judgment is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $5,353.59.
BACKGROUND
This
is a disability rights action. Plaintiff Orlando Garcia is physically disabled
and relies on mobility devices such as wheelchairs to ambulate. Defendant
Hideco Investment LLC (Hideco) allegedly owns a property in Covina upon which Defendant
Country Liquor Market 2, Inc. (Country Liquor) operates a liquor store. In June
2023, Garcia visited Country Liquor for the purpose of making a purchase and
conducting disability access testing. Garcia alleges the following barriers to
access existed, including narrow paths of travel and non-compliant door
hardware.
On August
23, 2023, Garcia filed a complaint against Hideco, Country Liquor, and Does 1-50,
alleging (1) violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act (UCRA) and (2) violation of
the California Disabled Persons Act (DPA). On September 5, 2023, Garica served
Country Liquor with substitute service in Covina. On September 11, 2023, Garica
served Hideco with substitute service in Long Beach.
On
March 4, 2024, Garcia dismissed Hideco from the present action.
On
April 16, 2024, the Court entered default against Country Liquor after they
failed to file an answer. On June 26, 2024, Garcia submitted the present
application for default judgment.
A case
management conference is set for June 26, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
Garcia
seeks default judgment against Country Liquor in the total amount of $9,313.69,
including $4,000 in damages, $4,490 in attorney fees, and $823.69 in costs. Because
the Court finds Garcia has submitted sufficient evidence, the Court GRANTS Garcia’s
application for default judgment with the following modifications.
First,
while Garcia requests $4,490, the Court finds this amount excessive and
unreasonable considering the routine and default nature of the present action.
Instead, the Court awards reasonable attorney fees in the amount of $330
pursuant to Local Rule 3.214. Second, while Garcia requests $823.69 in costs,
the Court notes the actual sum of the costs requested is $1,023.59.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Garcia’s
application for default judgment is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $5,353.59
($4,000 in damages + $330 in attorney’s fees + $1,023.50 in costs).  Plaintiff is ordered to submit a judgment
consistent with this ruling.
