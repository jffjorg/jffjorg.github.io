Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion for sanctions against the defendant and/or defendant's counsel for violating the parties' agreement to exclude evidence of prior lawsuits. The court finds that the defendant's counsel, Mr. Boags, acted in bad faith and was frivolous in questioning the witness about prior lawsuits despite the parties' agreement. The court orders the defendant and Mr. Boags to pay the plaintiff's costs and fees pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure, section 128.5. The court defers the determination of the amount awarded until the conclusion of the matter.
