And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of VIG Private Lending, Inc. v. Ilan Kenig and Avivit Kenig. The plaintiff, VIG Private Lending, Inc., is seeking a preliminary injunction to gain physical access to the property, which was foreclosed upon, to perform repairs and show it to potential buyers. The defendants, Ilan Kenig and Avivit Kenig, are opposing the motion, arguing that the motion is moot because the plaintiff's inspector already came to the property and found no damage, and that possession is being adjudicated in a separate unlawful detainer action between the parties.

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction, finding that the plaintiff has not shown that the condition of the property is so poor that irreparable harm could occur without issuance of an injunction. The judge also declines to interfere with the unlawful detainer case by making orders regarding right of entry and possession, and instead leaves it to the parties to resolve their disputes through that process.
