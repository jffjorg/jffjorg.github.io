And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses a demurrer to the Second Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate filed by the Crane Boulevard Safety Coalition (Petitioner) against the City of Los Angeles (Respondent). The Petitioner challenges certain patterns and practices of the Respondent relating to the Mount Washington/Glassell Park Specific Plan and the proposed development housing project located at 464-466 Crane Boulevard.

The Judge sustains the Respondent's demurrer as to the third cause of action, which alleges that the Respondent's approval of the project was untimely, as it was filed more than one year after the expiration of the 90-day statute of limitations for actions challenging an agency's final determination of compliance with a specific plan. The Judge finds that the Petitioner has not shown an exception to the 90-day statute of limitations and that the third cause of action is therefore untimely.

However, the Judge overrules the Respondent's demurrer as to the fourth cause of action, which alleges that the Respondent failed to provide a fair hearing in connection with the approval of the project. The Judge finds that the Petitioner has pled sufficient facts to allege a violation of due process and that the fourth cause of action is therefore sufficient.

The Judge orders the Respondent to file and serve an answer to the Second Amended Petition within 30 days of notice of the ruling.
