As for the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Gerald Whitt, et al. v. Vinco Ventures, Inc., et al. regarding a motion to quash service of summons filed by Christopher Smedley, a specially appearing defendant. Smedley argues that the court lacks jurisdiction over him and that the service of summons was untimely. However, the Judge finds that the court has specific jurisdiction over Smedley due to his connection to Cloud B, a California company, and the alleged conspiracy between Smedley and Pearl 33 to sell Cloud B and loot its assets. The Judge also finds that the service of summons was timely. Therefore, Smedley's motion to quash is denied.
