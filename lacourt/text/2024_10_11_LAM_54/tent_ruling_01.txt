BACKGROUND
 
On July 5, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the
operative first amended complaint against Defendants, asserting causes of
action for intentional and negligent misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary
duty, breach of contract, conspiracy, malicious prosecution, and abuse of
process. Plaintiffs were minority shareholders of Cloud B. Plaintiffs allege
the Defendant majority shareholders conspired with the takeover Defendants to
sell Cloud B and loot Cloud B’s assets, making Plaintiffs’ shares worthless. 
 
 
 
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
“A defendant, on or before the last day of
his or her time to plead or within any further time that the court may for good
cause allow, may serve and file a notice of motion for one or more of the
following purposes: (1) To quash service of summons on the ground of lack of
jurisdiction of the court over him or her.”  (CCP §
418.10(a)(1).)  “When a motion to quash is properly brought, the
burden of proof is placed upon the plaintiff to establish the facts of
jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.” (Aquila, Inc. v. Sup. Ct. (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 556, 568.)
A non-resident defendant may be subject to
either general or specific jurisdiction. (See Elkman v. National States
Insurance Co. (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 1305, 1314.)  General jurisdiction exists when a defendant
is domiciled in the forum state or his activities there are substantial,
continuous, and systematic. (F. Hoffman-La Roche, Inc. v. Sup. Ct. (2005)
130 Cal.App.4th 782, 796.) 
Specific
jurisdiction involves a 3-part test in California. California courts adopt the
same test as the test used by the court in Boschetto v. Hansing (9th
Cir. Cal. 2008) 539 F.3d 1011,1016: “ ‘(1) The nonresident defendant must do
some act or consummate some transaction with the forum or perform some act by
which he purposefully avails himself of the privilege of conducting activities
in the forum, thereby invoking the benefits and protections of its laws; (2)
the claim must be one which arises out of or results from the defendant's
forum-related activities; and (3) exercise of jurisdiction must be reasonable.’
Panavision International, L.P. v. Toeppen (9th Cir. 1998) 141 F.3d 1316,
1320 [applying California law].).” (Jewish Defense Organization, Inc. v.
Sup. Ct. of Los Angeles County (Rambam) (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 1045, 1054.)
 
Specially
Appearing Defendant Christopher Smedley moves to quash service of summons on
the ground that this Court does not have personal jurisdiction over him.
Smedley is a resident of Pennsylvania; the Court does not have general
jurisdiction over Smedley. Smedley asserts that the Court does not have
specific jurisdiction over him because he did not purposefully avail himself of
the privileges of conducting activities in California. 
 
Plaintiffs
allege that Smedley is the alter ego of Defendant Pearl 33. Plaintiffs present
evidence showing Smedley listed himself as the Chief Executive Officer of Cloud
B on Cloud B’s California Statement of Information. As acknowledged in Pearl
33’s motion to quash, Pearl 33 purposefully availed itself of the laws and
benefits of California by purchasing Cloud B. Plaintiffs’ action arises from
this purchase. Plaintiffs’ alter ego allegations and their evidence showing
Smedley was the chief executive of California company Cloud B are sufficient to
show purposeful availment and specific jurisdiction.
 
Smedley also
argues that he was not timely served with this action under CCP § 583.420. In opposition, Plaintiffs assert service is timely because it
was done within a year after he was added to the action in 2023. The Court
agrees. 
 
Smedley’s motion to quash is DENIED.
