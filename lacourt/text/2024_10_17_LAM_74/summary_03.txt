And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions to compel further responses, one related to requests for production and the other to special interrogatories, set two. The Judge denies both motions because the plaintiff's separate statement does not accurately and faithfully recite the defendants' discovery responses. The Judge does not need to consider the other grounds cited by the defendants in opposition to the motions to compel. As a result, the defendants will be required to give notice.
