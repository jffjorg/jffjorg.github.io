And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to deem service complete. The plaintiff, David Sedaghat, has been unable to serve the defendant, Sava Seniorcare Administrative Services LLC, and its chief executive, Jerry Roles, and has instead attempted to serve the law firm Lewis, Brisbois, Bisgaard & Smith LLP, which represents the defendant in a related matter. The plaintiff argues that the law firm has a duty to receive and forward the service of process to the defendant, but the court finds that the law firm may not accept service of documents until it has made an appearance in the matter. The court also denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions. The plaintiff is required to give notice of the court's ruling.
