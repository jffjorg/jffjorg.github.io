 Case Number:  23CHCV02983    Hearing Date:   July 9, 2024    Dept:  F49    Dept.    F49      Date:    7/9/24     Case    Name: Maria Rincon v. Evangelina Rivera; and Does 1-50     Case No.    23CHCV02983      LOS  ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT NORTH  VALLEY DISTRICT DEPARTMENT  F49    JULY 9, 2024    MOTION FOR ORDER COMPELLING  PLAINTIFF TO RESPOND TO REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS; REQUEST FOR  SANCTIONS  Los Angeles Superior Court Case No. 23CHCV02983    Motion  filed: 4/12/24   MOVING PARTY: Defendant Evangelina Rivera (“Rivera”  or “Plaintiff”) RESPONDING PARTY: None NOTICE: OK   RELIEF  REQUESTED: An order  compelling Plaintiff Maria Rincon’s (“Rincon” or “Plaintiff”) responses to  Defendant’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, and imposing  monetary sanctions, against Plaintiff and her attorney of record, in the amount  of $561.65.     TENTATIVE  RULING: The motion  is GRANTED. The request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED.   BACKGROUND   This action arises from alleged personal injuries and  property damages sustained by Plaintiff as a result of an automotive collision  that occurred on October 15, 2021. The Complaint alleges that Defendant ignored  a solid red stop light, striking Plaintiff in a “t-bone” accident. (Compl. ¶¶  7-8.)   On October 4, 2023, Plaintiff filed her Complaint against  Defendant and Does 1–50, alleging the following causes of action: (1) Negligence,  and (2) Motor Vehicle Negligence. Subsequently, on January 3, 2024, Defendant  filed an Answer to the Complaint.    On April 12, 2024, Defendant filed the instant Motion to Compel Responses  to Requests for Production of Documents and Request for Monetary Sanctions (the  “Motion”).   No Opposition or Reply papers have been received by the Court.   ANALYSIS   If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,  testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response, the  propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and for a monetary  sanction. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) Unlike a motion to compel  further responses, a motion to compel responses in not subject to a 45-day time  limit, and the propounding party does not have to demonstrate either good cause  or that it satisfied a “meet and confer” requirement. (Sinaiko Healthcare  Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th  390, 404 [internal citations omitted].)   A.     Motion to  Compel Responses to Requests for Production of Documents, Set One   Defendant counsel attests that on January 2, 2024,  Defendant propounded the first set of Request for Production of Documents on  Plaintiff, to which the responses were due on February 5, 2024. (Cadena Decl. ¶  3.) However, no responses were received from Plaintiff by the due date. (Id.  ¶ 4.) Subsequently, on March 8, 2024, Defendant’s counsel sent a meet and confer  letter regarding the late discovery responses and requested Plaintiff’s counsel  to provides responses, without objection, by March 18, 2024. (Id. ¶ 5.)  Despite the effort, no responses were received by March 18, 2024, and no  extensions were requested by Plaintiff. (Id. ¶ 6.) Furthermore,  Defendant’s counsel called and left a voicemail to Plaintiff’s counsel on April  12, 2024. (Id. ¶ 8.) To date, Plaintiff has not responded to Defendant’s  Requests for Production of Documents, Set One. (Id. ¶ 7.) Based on the records  above, and given that no Opposition has been filed by Plaintiff, the Court  finds that Plaintiff has failed to serve a timely response, thereby waiving any  objection to the Demand for Inspection and Production of Documents, including  those based on privilege or the protection for work product, pursuant to Code  of Civil Procedure section 2031.300, subdivision (a). Therefore, the Court  GRANTS the Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to Defendant’s Requests for  Production of Documents, Set One. B.      Request for  Monetary Sanctions Code of Civil Procedure section  2031.300, subdivision (c) provides, in part, “Except as provided in subdivision  (d), the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing  with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully  makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection,  copying, testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the  sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make  the imposition of the sanction unjust.”    As  the Court has previously granted the Motion, it concludes that the mandatory  monetary sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300, subdivision  (c) are applicable here.   Accordingly, in view of the  totality of the circumstances, the Court finds that the total and reasonable  amount of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work in preparing the  Motion is $561.65, calculated at a reasonable hourly rate of $250 for two hours  reasonably spent plus $61.65 for filing fees.   Therefore, Defendant’s Request for  Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED.   CONCLUSION   Defendant’s Motion to Compel Responses to Requests for  Production of Documents, Set One, is GRANTED.    Plaintiff is ordered to serve responses to Defendant’s  Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, without objection, within 20  days of this order.    Defendant’s Request for Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED.   Plaintiff and her attorney or record are ordered to pay  $561.65, jointly and severally to Defendant within 20 days.    Moving party to give notice.
