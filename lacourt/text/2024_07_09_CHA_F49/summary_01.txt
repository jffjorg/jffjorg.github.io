Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the Defendant's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, without leave to amend. The Defendant argued that the Plaintiff's Complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against him, citing judicially noticed admissions that were deemed admitted by the Court. The Judge agreed, finding that the Plaintiff's Complaint was meritless due to the admitted facts, and therefore granted the motion. The Judge also denied the Plaintiff's request for leave to amend, as there was no reasonable possibility of successful amendment.
