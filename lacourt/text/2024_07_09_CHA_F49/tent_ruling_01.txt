  Case Number:  23CHCV00240    Hearing Date:   July 9, 2024    Dept:  F49    Dept.    F49     Date:    7/9/24     Case    Name: James Howard v. Prosper Benhaim     Case No.    23CHCV00240      LOS ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT NORTH VALLEY DISTRICT DEPARTMENT F49    JULY 9, 2024    MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE  PLEADINGS  Los Angeles Superior  Court Case No. 23CHCV00240    Motion  filed: 2/1/24   MOVING PARTY: Defendant Prosper Benhaim (“Benhaim”  or the “Defendant”)  RESPONDING PARTY: None. NOTICE: OK.   RELIEF  REQUESTED: A  judgment on Plaintiff’s Complaint on the grounds that Plaintiff does not state  facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against Defendant.   TENTATIVE  RULING: The motion  is GRANTED without LEAVE TO AMEND.   BACKGROUND   On January 27, 2023, Plaintiff James Howard (“Howard” or  “Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendant alleging Medical Malpractice.  Subsequently, on March 8, 2023, Defendant filed his Answer to the Complaint.   On January 29, 2024, Department F51 Court granted  Defendant’s unopposed motions to compel Plaintiff’s responses to discovery  requests, and to deem admitted his Requests for Admission, Set One, filed on  November 3, 2023. (1/29/24 Minute Order).   On February 1, 2024, Defendant filed the instant Motion for  Judgment on the Pleadings (the “Motion”).   No Opposition or Reply papers have been received by the  Court.   ANALYSIS   “A motion for judgment on  the pleadings is the equivalent of a demurrer made after the pleadings are in.”  (Connerly v. Schwarzenegger (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 739, 746 [quoting Columbia  Casualty Co. v. Northwestern Nat. Ins. Co. (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 457,  463].) A party may move for a judgment on the pleadings as to an entire  complaint or as to a particular cause of action in a complaint. (Code Civ. Proc.,  §¿438, subd. (c)(2)(A).) If a defendant moves for judgment on the pleadings and  argues that a complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause  of action against that defendant, then the court should grant a defendant’s motion  only if the court finds as a matter of law that the complaint fails to allege  facts sufficient to constitute the cause of action. (Code Civ. Proc., §¿438,  subd.(c)(1)(B)(ii); see also Mechanical Contractors Assn. v. Greater Bay  Area Assn. (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 672, 677.)    “The standard for granting a  motion for judgment on the pleadings is essentially the same as that applicable  to a general demurrer, that is, under the state of the pleadings, together with  matters that may be judicially noticed, it appears that a party is entitled to  judgment as a matter of law.” (Bezirdjian v. O’Reilly (2010) 183  Cal.App.4th 316, 321.) A judgment on the pleadings attacks only defects  disclosed on the face of the pleadings or by matters that can be judicially  noticed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (d); Lance Camper Manufacturing  Corp. v. Republic Indemnity Co. (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 194, 198.)    When considering a motion  for judgment on the pleadings, the court should assume that all facts alleged  are true and should liberally construe the alleged facts “with a view to  attaining substantial justice among the parties.” (See Alliance Mortgage Co.  v. Rothwell (1995) 10 Cal.4th 1226, 1232; Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) “Both a  demurrer and a motion for judgment on the pleadings accept as true all material  factual allegations of the challenged pleading, unless contrary to law or to  facts of which a court may take judicial notice.” (Edwards v. Centex Real  Estate Corp. (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 15, 27.)    “Whether a motion for  judgment on the pleadings should be granted with or without leave to amend  depends on ‘whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be  cured by amendment…’” (Mendoza v. Rast Produce Co., Inc. (2006) 140  Cal.App.4th 1395, 1402 [quoting Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311,  318].) “When a cure is a reasonable possibility, the trial court abuses its  discretion by not granting leave to amend…” (Ibid.)    A.     Meet and  Confer Requirement   Code of Civil Procedure  section 439, subdivision (a) provides, “Before filing a statutory motion for  judgment on the pleadings, the moving party must meet and confer in person or  by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to the motion  for judgment on the pleadings for the purpose of determining if an agreement  can be reached that resolves the claims to be raised in the motion for judgment  on the pleadings.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 439, subd. (a).) However, “determination  by the court that the meet and confer process was insufficient is not grounds  to grant or deny the motion for judgment on the pleadings.”                Furthermore, “[t]he moving party  shall file and serve with the motion for judgment on the pleadings a  declaration stating either of the following: (A) The means by which  the moving party met and conferred with the party who filed the pleading  subject to the motion for judgment on the pleadings, and that the parties did  not reach an agreement resolving the claims raised by the motion for judgment  on the pleadings. (B) That the party who filed the pleading subject to the  motion for judgment on the pleadings failed to respond to the meet and confer  request of the moving party or otherwise failed to meet and confer in good  faith.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 439, subd. (a)(3).)              Here, Defendant’s counsel  attests that on January 31, 2024, he called and spoke to Plaintiff in order to  meet and confer regarding issues raised in the Motion. (Corson Decl. ¶ 7.)  According to Defendant’s counsel’s declaration, during the meet and confer  phone call, Plaintiff stated that he understood that Defendant would be seeking  a dismissal based on matters deemed admitted, and Plaintiff indicated that he  would try and get his case back in order. (Ibid.)               Based on  the above records, the Court determines that the requirements for meet and  confer have been sufficiently met.   B.      Requests for  Judicial Notice   Defendant requests that the  Court take judicial notice of the following documents:    (1)   “This Court’s January 29, 2024 Minute Order Deeming  the Truth of Matters Specified in Requests for Admission Propounded on  Plaintiff JAMES HOWARD Admitted (attached hereto as Exhibit “A”).”   (2)   “Defendant  PROSPER BENHAIM, M.D.’s Request For Admissions, Set No. 1, Propounded on  Plaintiff JAMES HOWARD (attached hereto as Exhibit “B”).”   A court may take judicial notice of  the contents of its own records. (Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (d); Dwan v.  Dixon (1963) 216 Cal.App.2d 260, 265; Foster v. Gray (1962) 203  Cal.App.2d 434, 439.)    Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendant’s Request  for Judicial Notice.   C.     Motion for  Judgment on the Pleadings   1)       Cause of Action  – Medical Malpractice   A prima facie case for medical  malpractice consists of (1) a duty to conform to the relevant standard of care;  (2) a breach of that duty, i.e., the negligent conduct; (3) a proximate causal  connection between the negligent conduct and the injury; and (4) resulting  damage. (Lattimore v. Dickey (2015) 239 Cal.App.4th 959, 968.)¿A  healthcare provider is negligent if he or she fails to use the level of skill,  knowledge, and care in diagnosis and treatment that other reasonably careful  healthcare providers of the same type would use in the same or similar  circumstances. (Landeros v. Flood (1976) 17 Cal.3d 399, 408.)    Here, Defendant argues that  Plaintiff’s action is barred because Plaintiff was deemed to have admitted that  he had no basis for his action against Defendant. Specifically, it was deemed  admitted that “defendant PROSPER BENHAIM, M.D., complied with the STANDARD OF  CARE at all times when rendering treatment to [Plaintiff],” that “any action  taken by defendant PROSPER BENHAIM, M.D., was not a SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR in  causing any INJURY to [Plaintiff],” that “any action which was not taken by  defendant PROSPER BENHAIM, M.D. was not a SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR in causing any  INJURY to [Plaintiff],” and that “to a reasonable degree of medical probability  [Plaintiff] have not suffered any INJURY due to a breach of the STANDARD OF  CARE by defendant PROSPER BENHAIM, M.D.” (RJN, Ex. “A,” and “B.”) Defendant  contends that by these admissions, which demonstrate the absence of the  necessary elements for the claim, Plaintiff cannot sufficiently state a cause  of action for Medical Malpractice. (Mot. at pp. 4-5.)    The Court agrees. The Court notes that “a complaint's  allegations may be disregarded when they conflict with judicially  noticed discovery responses.” (Bockrath v. Aldrich Chemical  Co. (1999) 21 Cal.4th 71, 83.) Accordingly, a pleading valid on its face may  nevertheless be subject to demurrer when judicially noticed admissions render the  complaint meritless. (Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co.  (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604.)    Here, in alignment with  these established precedents, the judicial notice of the Minute Order dated  January 29, 2024, deeming matters admitted by Plaintiff, is dispositive in this  case. The admissions conclusively establish that Defendant did not act below  the standard of care and that no act or omission by Defendant was a substantial  factor in causing Plaintiff’s alleged injuries. As a result, Plaintiff has  failed to demonstrate the essential elements of a medical malpractice claim.    Therefore, given that  Plaintiff has admitted that his action against Defendant was meritless, the  Court GRANTS the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings.    2)       Leave to Amend   Leave to amend must be allowed where  there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v.  Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the complainant to  show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.)               Here, Plaintiff does not  submit any Opposition to the Motion or argue there is a reasonable possibility  of successful amendment, failing to meet his burden. Moreover, even assuming  that Plaintiff’s single-page Complaint may be amended to state a cause of  action, it does not overcome the judicially noticed admissions rendering a  valid complaint meritless. (See Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co.,  supra, 123 Cal.App.3d at p. 604.)   Accordingly, the Court  DENIES leave to amend.   CONCLUSION   Defendant’s unopposed Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings  is GRANTED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.   Moving  party to give notice.
