And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Defendant State Farm General Insurance Company's motion for protective order, which prevents Plaintiffs Barry and Elise Kagasoff from taking depositions and seeking documents from Chris Paul and Boban Marjanovic. The judge finds that Defendant has shown good cause for the protective order because neither Paul nor Marjanovic have any knowledge of the existence of Plaintiffs' water loss, any agreement or policy between Plaintiffs' and State Farm, or State Farm's handling of Plaintiffs' claim.

The judge also grants Defendant's motion to quash Plaintiffs' deposition subpoenas for Chris Paul and Boban Marjanovic, finding that the motions are moot in light of the protective order.

Additionally, the judge grants Defendant's motion to seal the record, finding that there is an overriding interest in favor of maintaining the confidentiality of the information and that the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored.
