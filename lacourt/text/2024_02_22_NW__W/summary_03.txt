Summary in English:

This tentative ruling addresses Defendant Alejandro Hugo Navarro's motion to strike punitive damages from Plaintiff Araz Arabian's complaint. The court finds that the Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged facts to support a claim for punitive damages, despite the Defendant's arguments that the allegations are still conclusory. The court notes that the complaint alleges that the Defendant operated his vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, with a blood alcohol level of at least 0.08%, and that he was arrested and convicted for DUI. The court concludes that this is sufficient at the pleading stage to support a claim for punitive damages, and therefore denies the Defendant's motion to strike.
