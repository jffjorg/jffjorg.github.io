And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint and the motion to strike. The court finds that the defendants' demurrer to the sixth, seventh, and eighth causes of action is sustained, while the demurrer to the sixth and seventh causes of action is overruled. The court also grants the motion to strike in part, striking the prayer for punitive damages.

The court finds that the complaint states facts sufficient to support a claim of nuisance against the defendants, but fails to allege compliance with California Civil Code section 1942.4. The court also finds that the complaint alleges intentional infliction of emotional distress, but fails to plead the requisite specificity for a claim of elder abuse.

The court sustains the demurrer to the eleventh cause of action, requiring the plaintiffs to plead the cause of action with the requisite specificity. The court grants the motion to strike in part, striking the prayer for punitive damages.
