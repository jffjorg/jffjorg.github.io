BACKGROUND 
 
Plaintiffs
Barry Kagasoff and Elise Kagasoff (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed an
insurance claim with Defendant, State Farm General Insurance Company
(“Defendant”) when a hot water pipe allegedly burst causing water damage to
their Property. Plaintiffs state that a representative of Defendant told them
that all necessary mitigation and demolition work would be performed and all
repairs and replacements would be covered by the policy. However, Defendant
subsequently stated that the Property damage was not covered by the Policy and
refused to pay for additional expenses, forcing Plaintiffs to remain living in
their home where mitigation efforts were taking place. 
 
Plaintiffs
commenced this action on July 1, 2022. On September 13, 2022, Plaintiffs filed
the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) alleging: (1) Breach of Contract;
(2) Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; (3) Fraud; (4)
Negligent Misrepresentation; (5) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress;
and (6) Financial Elder Abuse.

DISCUSSION
 
I.                   
DEFENDANT STATE FARM GENERAL INSURANCE
COMPANY’S MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER AND REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS
 
Defendant
State Farm General Insurance Company moves the court for a protective order
against Plaintiff Barry and Elise Kagasoff preventing them from taking the
depositions of Chris Paul and Boban Marjanovic, demanding documents from Chris
Paul and Boban Marjanovic, and calling them to testify at trial. Defendant
State Farm also requests sanctions in the amount of $2,100.00 for forcing it to
file this motion.
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2025.420(a) authorizes parties, deponents or other
affected natural persons to move for a protective order.  Among other
things, a protective order may direct that a deposition not be taken at
all.  (CCP § 2025.420(b)(1).)  A motion for protective order must be
accompanied by a declaration setting forth facts demonstrating a reasonable and
good faith attempt to meet-and-confer with the deposing counsel to resolve the
dispute without the Court’s intervention.  (CCP §§ 2016.040,
2025.420(a).)  The moving party must also demonstrate “good cause” for the
relief sought.  (CCP § 2025.420(b); Nativi v. Deutsche Bank Nat’l Trust
Co. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 261, 318.) 
 
Defendant
State Farm brings this motion on the grounds that good cause exists for the requested
order because neither Mr. Paul nor Mr. Marjanovic have any knowledge of the existence
of Plaintiffs’ water loss, any agreement or policy between Plaintiffs’ and
State Farm, or State Farm’s handling of Plaintiffs’ claim. Defendant State Farm
further contends Plaintiffs are seeking State Farm’s trade secrets, including
knowledge of Mr. Paul nor Mr. Marjanovic’s contracts with and compensation from
State Farm, neither of which has any relevance whatsoever to Plaintiffs’
claims. 
 
In
opposition, Plaintiff argues the records sought by the subpoenas are directly
relevant to expose the dissonance between Defendant's public image and its
actual treatment of insureds. Plaintiff contends Defendant cannot
simultaneously project an image of reliability and care, epitomized by slogans
like "like a good neighbor, State Farm is there," while behind the
scenes, engaging in practices that betray the trust of its insureds. Plaintiff
further contends Defendant State Farm has not made the necessary particularized
and non-conclusory showing establishing that the documents Plaintiffs have
requested constitute trade secrets or are otherwise proprietary, or that the
materials meet the requirements for the confidential protection sought.
 
Defendant
State Farm has shown good cause for the protective order sought. There is no
information that Chris Paul or Boban Marjanovic could provide that would lead
to discoverable and relevant information. State Farm’s private endorsement
deals including agreements, payment, and communications with celebrities and/or
spokespersons will not aide in Plaintiff’s argument that State Farm promotes
“being there” for its insureds, when in fact, they are not “there”. If
Plaintiff finds the advertisements by Mr. Paul and Mr. Marjanovic relevant, the
commercials are in the public domain and Plaintiff’s may use the commercials itself
at trial to show “Defendant prioritizes goodwill, while in truth, it lacks
genuine intent to address its insureds' valid claims in good faith.” (Opp. p.
6.) However, how much a company pays a spokesperson and the agreements entered
into with the spokesperson has absolutely nothing to do with this lawsuit. Accordingly,
Plaintiff cannot seek the deposition of Mr. Paul or Mr. Marjanovic, cannot
request production of documents from Mr. Paul or Mr. Marjanovic, and cannot
call either Mr. Paul or Mr. Marjanovic to trial. 
 
Accordingly,
Defendant State Farm General Insurance Company’s Motion for Protective Order is
GRANTED. 
 
Sanctions
 
Defendant
State Farm also requests sanctions in the amount of $2,100 against Plaintiffs
and their counsel on the grounds they have not be said to have acted with
substantial justification for noticing the depositions of Mr. Paul and Mr.
Marjanovic. 
 
The
court shall impose a monetary sanction against any party who unsuccessfully
makes or opposes a motion or a protective order, unless the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or other circumstances make
imposition of the sanction unjust.
 
In
opposition, Plaintiffs argue there is no evidence of discovery abuse by Plaintiffs,
or their counsel and Plaintiffs are in no way are trying to harass or annoy
Defendant. Plaintiffs contend they are merely preparing for trial and intend to
unveil Defendant's consistent pattern and practice concerning its treatment of
its insureds, which appears to contradict the information disseminated through
its advertising campaigns. 
 
While
sanctions might be appropriate given the overbreadth of these requests, defendant
did not indicate against whom they seek sanctions in the notice.  That omission is fatal to a request for
sanctions, no matter how deserved. 
C.C.P. Section 2023.040.
 
II.                 
DEFENDANT STATE FARM GENERAL INSURANCE
COMPANY’S MOTION TO QUASH AS TO DEPONENT #1 AND REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS
 
Defendant
State Farm moves the court for an order quashing Plaintiffs Barry and Elise
Kagasoff’s Deposition Subpoena for Personal Appearance and Production of
Documents and Things Directed to Deponent #1 (Chris Paul). Deponent #1 also
seeks monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,165.00 for having to quash
Plaintiffs’ frivolous and harassing deposition subpoena. 
 
In
light of the ruling above, Defendant State Farm’s Motion to Quash as to
Deponent #1 and Request for Sanctions is MOOT. 
 
III.               
DEFENDANT STATE FARM GENERAL INSURANCE
COMPANY’S MOTION TO QUASH AS TO DEPONENT #2 AND REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS
 
Defendant
State Farm moves the court for an order quashing Plaintiffs Barry and Elise
Kagasoff’s Deposition Subpoena for Personal Appearance and Production of
Documents and Things Directed to Deponent #2 (Boban Marjanovic). Deponent #2
also seeks monetary sanctions in the amount of $587.00 for having to quash
Plaintiffs’ frivolous and harassing deposition subpoena. 
 
In
light of the ruling above, Defendant State Farm’s Motion to Quash as to
Deponent #2 and Request for Sanctions is MOOT. 
 
IV.              
DEFENDANT STATE FARM GENERAL INSURANCE
COMPNAY’S MOTION FOR ORDER SEALING NON-PARTIES’ MOTION TO QUASH PLAINTIFFS’
DEPOSITION SUBPOENAS AND DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER
 
Defendant
State Farm General Insurance Company moves for an order sealing the MOTION TO
QUASH PLAINTIFFS’ DEPOSITION SUBPOENA FOR PERSONAL APPEARANCE AND PRODUCTION OF
DOCUMENTS AND THINGS TO DEPONENT # 1, MOTION TO QUASH PLAINTIFFS’ DEPOSITION
SUBPOENA FOR PERSONAL APPEARANCE AND PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS AND THINGS TO
DEPONENT # 2, AND DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER, and all documents in
support thereof, including but not limited to any orders issued as well as this
MOTION TO SEAL on the grounds that there exists an overriding interest that
overcomes the right of public access to the record which supports sealing the
record and a substantial probability that the overriding interest will be
prejudiced if the record is not sealed, the proposed sealing is narrowly
tailored and no less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding
interest. 
 
California
law authorizes the sealing of court records containing confidential
information. (See NBC Subsidiary, Inc. v. Superior Court (1999) 20
Cal.4th 1178, 1222, n. 46.) California Rules of Court Rule 2.551(a) provides
that a record may not be filed under seal without a court order and the court
must not permit a record to be filed under seal based solely on the agreement
or stipulation of the parties.  The party
requesting a record be filed under seal must file a motion or an application
for an order sealing the record that is accompanied by a memorandum or
declaration containing facts to justify the sealing.  (CRC Rule 2.551(b)(1).) “The court may order
that a record be filed under seal” if it finds that there is an overriding
interest in favor of maintaining the confidentiality of the information.  (CRC Rule 2.550(d).)
 
The
factual findings required to seal records require the court to expressly find
that (1) there exists an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public
access to the record; (2) the overriding interest supports sealing the record;
(3) a substantial probability exists that the overriding interest will be
prejudiced if the record is not sealed; (4) the proposed sealing is narrowly
tailored; and (5) no less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding
interest. (CRC Rule 2.550(d)(1)-(5).)
 
The
court finds good cause for sealing Defendants’ MOTION TO QUASH PLAINTIFFS’
DEPOSITION SUBPOENA FOR PERSONAL APPEARANCE AND PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS AND
THINGS TO DEPONENT # 1, MOTION TO QUASH PLAINTIFFS’ DEPOSITION SUBPOENA FOR
PERSONAL APPEARANCE AND PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS AND THINGS TO DEPONENT # 2, AND
DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER, and all documents in support thereof,
including the MOTION TO SEAL. 
 
The
motion is unopposed. Defendant State Farm’s Motion to Seal is GRANTED.
