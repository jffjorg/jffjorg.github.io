Significant Statements:

  - "A condition is not a dangerous condition if, viewing the evidence most favorably to the plaintiff, the risk created by the condition was of such a minor, trivial or insignificant nature in view of the surrounding circumstances that no reasonable person would conclude that the condition created a substantial risk of injury when used with due care in a manner in which it was reasonably foreseeable that it would be used."
  - "A public entity has ‘constructive notice of a dangerous condition’ ‘only if’ (1) ‘the condition had existed for’ some period of time prior to the plaintiff's accident, and (2) ‘the condition ... was of such an obvious nature that the public entity, in the exercise of due care, should have discovered the condition and its dangerous character.’"
```

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the City of Los Angeles' motion for summary judgment in part, rejecting the plaintiff's claims for premises liability and dangerous condition of public property. The judge found that the City did not have actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition that caused the plaintiff's injuries, and that the plaintiff did not present sufficient evidence to establish a triable issue of fact. However, the judge also found that the plaintiff presented sufficient evidence to raise a triable issue of fact as to whether a dangerous condition existed, and therefore denied the City's motion for summary judgment as to that claim. The judge also granted the City's motion for summary adjudication as to the plaintiff's cause of action for premises liability, finding that the plaintiff did not present sufficient evidence to support that claim.
