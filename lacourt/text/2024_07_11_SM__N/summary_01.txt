Significant Statements:

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendants' second motion for terminating sanctions, evidentiary sanctions, and/or issue preclusion against the plaintiff. The defendants sought to have the plaintiff's case dismissed for failing to provide code-compliant responses and pay sanctions as ordered by the court. The judge found that the plaintiff has failed to comply with the court's prior order, but terminating sanctions are not warranted at this time. The court notes that the defendant's previous motion for terminating sanctions was denied in January 2024, and little has changed since then. The court also finds that the defendants have not provided sufficient evidence to support their request for terminating sanctions. The judge concludes that the defendants' motion is more of a motion for reconsideration and denies it.
