And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for an order compelling nonparty Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. to comply with a deposition subpoena seeking production of business records. The judge finds that the subpoena is overbroad and seeks records from birth until the present, which is a violation of the plaintiff's right to privacy in her medical records. The judge also finds that the defendants are not entitled to access to all medical records possessed by Kaiser without limitations as to time and scope.

The judge has also denied the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions. The plaintiff had alleged certain types of pain and medical conditions, but had not identified the motion under which she sought sanctions, rendering the imposition of the sanction unjust.
