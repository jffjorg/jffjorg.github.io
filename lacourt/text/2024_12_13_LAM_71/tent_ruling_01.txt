POURANDOKHT POURAT,  
 
  
         vs.
 
SHAHRAM MOUSSAZADEH. 


 Case No.: 
  22STCV24086
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  December 13, 2024



 
Cross-Defendant Hormoz Pourat’s, in pro
per, motion to
postpone the trial date is denied.
 
Cross-Defendant Hormoz Pourat (“Hormoz”) (“Cross-Defendant”)
moves in pro per for a motion to postpone the
trial date.  (Amended Notice Postpone,
pg. 1.)
 
          Legal Standard      
          Entry of defendant’s default
instantaneously cuts off its right to appear in the action. A defaulted
defendant or cross-defendant has no right to participate in the proceedings
until either (a) its default is set aside (in which event, it may respond to the
complaint), or (b) a default judgment is entered (in which event it may
appeal.  (Devlin v. Kearny Mesa
AMC/Jeep/Renault, Inc. (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 381, 385-386.)
Entry
of default deprives the court of jurisdiction to consider any motion other than
a motion for relief from default.   (W.A.
Rose Co. v. Municipal Court for Oakland-Piedmont Judicial District, Alameda
County (1959) 176 Cal.App.2d 67, 72 [stating superior court clerk
improperly refused to enter default and writ issued to prevent court from
considering defendant’s late-filed motion for change of venue].)
 
          Discussion
          Cross-Defendant does not have standing
to postpone the trial date because he is not a Plaintiff in the original
Complaint.  Cross-Defendant is only a
party to Cross-Complainant’s Cross-Complaint, in which entry of default was
entered against Cross-Defendant in March 2023.
 
Conclusion
Cross-Defendant’s motion is
denied.
Moving Party to give notice.
