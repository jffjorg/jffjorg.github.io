And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denied Cross-Defendant Hormoz Pourat's motion to postpone the trial date. The judge stated that since the entry of default against Cross-Defendant in March 2023, Cross-Defendant has no right to participate in the proceedings until the default is set aside or a default judgment is entered. The judge also noted that Cross-Defendant does not have standing to postpone the trial date because he is not a plaintiff in the original complaint. The judge cited two cases, Devlin v. Kearny Mesa AMC/Jeep/Renault, Inc. and W.A. Rose Co. v. Municipal Court for Oakland-Piedmont Judicial District, Alameda County, to support this ruling.
