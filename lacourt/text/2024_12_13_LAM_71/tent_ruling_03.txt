MARTIN HUBBARD,  
  
        
  vs.
 
LONG BEACH MORTGAGE COMPANY.


 Case
  No.:  22STCV26720
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  December 13, 2024



 
The Court denies Plaintiff’s default
judgment packet.  
The Court sets a hearing on an order
to show cause why the complaint should not be dismissed and/or Plaintiff’s
counsel sanctioned $250 for failing to enter default judgment (California Rule
of Court, rule 3.110(h)) on January 27, 2025, at 8:30 AM in Department 71 at
Stanley Mosk Courthouse for the following reasons:

1.     Entry
of default has not been published; because Plaintiff served Defendant by
publication, Plaintiff must also provide Defendant notice of default.  Currently there is no proof of service for
the entry of default.
 
2.     No
request for Court Judgment submitted to the Court (CIV-100).
 
3.     No
DOE dismissal filed.
 
4.     Plaintiff’s
proposed judgment misspells Defendant’s name in ¶3 as “LONG BEACH MORTGGE
COMPANY.”
