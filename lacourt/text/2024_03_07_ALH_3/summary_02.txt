And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to compel arbitration of the dispute between the parties. The plaintiff, City of Hope National Medical Center, had filed an action against the defendant, BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina, et al., seeking to recover $1,647,205.52 plus applicable interest in reimbursement for medically necessary hospital care provided to Patient D.B. The defendant had filed a motion to dismiss or stay the action pending arbitration, arguing that the dispute is arbitrable under the fee-for-service hospital agreement between the parties.

The court finds that the defendant has met its burden of proving the existence of a valid arbitration agreement and that the claims are covered within the scope of the agreement. The court notes that the agreement requires the parties to arbitrate "any dispute between the parties", which includes tort and contractual liabilities. The court also finds that the plaintiff's fraud claims are not arbitrable because they are premised on the defendant's representations made during the Appeals Process, and therefore the dispute could not be "subject to review" through the Appeals Process.

The court concludes that the defendant's motion is granted and the action is dismissed. The parties are directed to arbitrate their disputes in accordance with the Commercial Rules of the American Arbitration Association.
