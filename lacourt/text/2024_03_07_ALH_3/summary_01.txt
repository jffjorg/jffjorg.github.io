Summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to compel the deposition of Leah Orloff, an employee of Harley-Davidson Motor Company, Inc. The plaintiff, Jose R. Rocaleon, seeks to depose Ms. Orloff to gather information related to the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The defendant argues that Ms. Orloff has already been deposed and that her testimony is protected by attorney-client privilege or work product doctrine. The court rejects these arguments and finds that Ms. Orloff is not an expert witness and that her testimony is not protected. The court grants the motion and orders the defendant to produce Ms. Orloff for deposition within 20 days.
