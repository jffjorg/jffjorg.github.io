And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling sustaining Defendant Douglas Lalonde's demurrer to the Fourth and Fifth Causes of Action in the Complaint. The Plaintiff, Val-Pro, Inc., alleges that it loaned Defendant $478,053 to assist in paying life insurance premiums, and that Defendant has not repaid the debt. The court finds that the allegations in the Complaint do not state a cause of action for conversion or violation of Penal Code § 496, as the property at issue is a loan made to Defendant which has allegedly not been repaid. The court orders that Plaintiff must make an "offer of proof" at the hearing demonstrating conduct beyond a mere contractual breach in order to amend the complaint. If Plaintiff fails to do so, the demurrer will be sustained, and Defendant will be ordered to file an answer within 21 days to the remaining causes of action.
