And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the petition to compel arbitration filed by the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 501 against Pundir Group, Inc. The decision is based solely on the issue of untimeliness. The union had filed a grievance alleging unfair termination of Ronald Thompson, but failed to request arbitration within the 14-day time limit specified in the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). The judge found that the CBA provides that the time limits "may be extended by mutual agreement between the Employer and the Union," but there is no evidence of such an agreement in this case. As a result, the union's request for arbitration is denied.
