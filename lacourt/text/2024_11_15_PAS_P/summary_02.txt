And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of General Motors, LLC's Person Most Qualified (PMQ) to address issues related to the vehicle's warranty, repair history, and GM's lemon law policies. The judge found that GM failed to respond with availability and ignored multiple meet-and-confer efforts, which unnecessarily delayed the discovery process. The judge also awarded Plaintiff's counsel $1,875 in sanctions for the time spent preparing the motion, attending the hearing, and filing the reply. The judge ordered GM to produce the PMQ for deposition within 30 days of the order and Plaintiff's counsel to receive the sanctions within 30 days of the order.
