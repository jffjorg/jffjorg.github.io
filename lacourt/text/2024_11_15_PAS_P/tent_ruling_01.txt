  Case Number:  23BBCV02032    Hearing Date:   November 15, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER OVERRULING DEFENDANT’S
DEMURRER TO SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT and DENYING DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO STRIKEI.          INTRODUCTION
This action arises from injuries
sustained by Plaintiff, Barri Whittaker (“Plaintiff”), due to an incident
involving Defendant Katherine Lee’s (“Defendant”) horse, Wiley (“Wiley”).
Plaintiff filed the instant action on June 5, 2024, alleging two causes of
action: (1) Negligence and (2) Fraud/Intentional Misrepresentation. Plaintiff
contends that she accepted a job to exercise Wiley based on Defendant’s alleged
misrepresentations regarding Wiley’s training, care, and safety. 
Plaintiff asserts that Defendant
assured her Wiley was properly trained and safe to handle; however, Wiley was
kept in isolation and deprived of adequate care, which Plaintiff claims led to
aggressive and unpredictable behavior. Plaintiff contends that these
misrepresentations exposed her to substantial risk, culminating in an incident
on January 19, 2023, when Wiley acted aggressively, causing her serious bodily
injury.
On July 2, 2024, Defendant filed a
demurrer with a motion to strike portions of Plaintiff's Second Amended
Complaint. Plaintiff filed an Opposition on November 1, 2024, and Defendant
submitted a reply on November 7, 2024.
 
Meet and Confer
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 430.41, subdivision (a), the demurring party is required to meet and
confer with the party who filed the pleading at least five days before the
responsive pleading is due. This must occur in person, telephone or by video
conference with the aim of resolving any objections raised in the demurrer.
Additionally, the demurring party must file and serve a declaration detailing
the meet and confer efforts. It should be noted, however, that the failure to
meet and confer is not itself grounds for sustaining or overruling a demurrer
or granting or denying a motion to strike. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, subd.
(a)(4), 435.5, subd. (a)(4).)
Here, on June 13, 2024, Defendant’s
Counsel, Ajay Sood, initiated the meet and confer process by sending a letter
to Plaintiff’s counsel (Sood Decl. ¶2). On June 27, 2024, Defendant’s counsel
contacted Ms. Lisa Jackson by phone, who directed him to speak with Mr. Tim
Wright. Defendant’s counsel then called Mr. Wright, leaving a voicemail
message, but Mr. Wright has not returned the call to date (Sood Decl. ¶3).
The Court finds that Defendant has
complied with the meet and confer requirement.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
A demurrer tests the legal
sufficiency of a complaint. Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994. A plaintiff’s allegations
must be accepted as true for purposes of demurrer, no matter how “improbable”
they are. (Del E. Webb Corp. v.
Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604 (Del E. Webb).) Allegations need not be
accepted as true if they are contradicted by judicially noticeable facts. (Cansino v. Bank of America (2014) 224
Cal.App.4th 1462, 1474.) 
Pleadings are to be broadly
construed (Code Civ. Proc., § 452) and demurrers are to be overruled where the
facts are sufficient to state any cause of action. (Quelimane Co. v. Stewart
Title Guaranty Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 38.)
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (f)
provides for a demurrer where a pleading is uncertain. Demurrers for
uncertainty are disfavored and are only sustained where a pleading is so incomprehensible
a defendant cannot reasonably respond. (A.J. Fistes v. GDL Best Contractors,
Inc. (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 677, 695; Khoury v. Maly’s of California (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) 
III.      ANALYSIS
A.   
General Demurrer – Failure to State
Facts Sufficient to Constitute a Cause of Action
Defendant demurs to the second
cause of action in Plaintiff’s SAC fraud/intentional misrepresentation in
Plaintiff’s SAC.
Second cause of action: fraud/intentional
misrepresentation
To establish a claim for deceit
based on intentional misrepresentation, the plaintiff must prove seven essential
elements: (1) the defendant represented to the plaintiff that an important fact
was true; (2) that representation was false; (3) the defendant knew that the
representation was false when the defendant made it, or the defendant made the
representation recklessly and without regard for its truth; (4) the defendant
intended that the plaintiff rely on the representation; (5) the plaintiff reasonably
relied on the representation; (6) the plaintiff was harmed; and (7) the
plaintiff's reliance on the defendant's representation was a substantial factor
in causing that harm to the plaintiff. (Manderville v. PCG & S Group,
Inc. (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1486, 1498) 
            Intentional
misrepresentation requires the defendant to represent a material fact as true
when it is actually false and the defendant knew the representation was false
when the defendant made it, or the defendant made the representation recklessly
and without regard for its truth. (See Manderville v. PCG & S Group,
Inc. (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1486, 1498.)  Defendant demurs on
grounds that Plaintiff’s allegations are speculative and insufficiently specific. 
 
Representation of material fact:
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant
made specific material representations regarding the condition and care of her
horse, Wiley, stating that Wiley was “properly trained, was receiving proper
care, and was being exercised or ridden on a weekly basis by Ms. Lee and/or her
agents” (SAC ¶ 54). These statements constitute representations of material
facts, as they convey critical information about the horse’s fitness and
temperament directly relevant to the position for which Plaintiff was hired.
Thus, the first element is sufficiently pled.
 
Representation was false:
Plaintiff asserts that Defendant’s
representations were false. Plaintiff claims that, contrary to Defendant’s
statements, Wiley was kept in “deficient and substandard conditions” for over a
year before April 2022, which included isolation in a small stall, lack of
exercise, inadequate socialization, and infrequent interaction (SAC ¶¶ 55-56).
Plaintiff provides details from neighbor Maude Lewis, who allegedly observed
Wiley’s isolation, lack of training, and inadequate care, further supporting
the falsity of Defendant’s statements (SAC ¶ 55). These allegations
sufficiently address the requirement of falsity. Thus, this element is
sufficiently plead.
Defendant’s knowledge of misrepresentation:
Plaintiff contends that Defendant
knowingly made these misrepresentations or acted with reckless disregard for
the truth. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant knew Wiley was kept in substandard
conditions and rarely exercised, contrary to her representations. Additionally,
Plaintiff references statements from neighbors, including Maude Lewis and
Melissa Kromhold, who described Defendant’s “bad reputation for maltreatment of
her horses” (SAC ¶ 63). This element is adequately addressed, as Plaintiff
asserts facts that support an inference that Defendant knew her statements were
false or acted recklessly in making them.
 
Intent to induce reliance:
Plaintiff claims that Defendant
intended for her to rely on the representations to persuade her to accept the
job of exercising Wiley. Plaintiff specifically alleges that Defendant made
these statements “in order to convince and persuade Plaintiff to take the job”
(SAC ¶ 57). This assertion is sufficient to establish Defendant’s intent to
induce reliance, satisfying this element.
 
Justifiable reliance:
Plaintiff alleges that she
justifiably relied on Defendant’s representations, as she was initially unaware
of Wiley’s true condition and accepted Defendant’s statements about Wiley’s
training and care as true (SAC ¶ 58). Plaintiff further alleges that even when
she observed issues with Wiley’s behavior, Defendant reassured her that Wiley’s
condition was not a concern, which she reasonably relied upon (SAC ¶ 37). Given
Plaintiff’s lack of prior knowledge regarding Wiley’s condition, these
allegations sufficiently establish justifiable reliance.
 
Harm:
Plaintiff alleges a direct causal
connection between her reliance on Defendant’s representations and her
injuries. Plaintiff describes an incident on January 19, 2023, where Wiley
became startled by a loud sound, allegedly due to his isolation and lack of
training, and reacted aggressively, causing Plaintiff to fall and sustain
significant injuries (SAC ¶ 60). This meets the element of harm, as Plaintiff
asserts that her reliance on Defendant’s representations placed her in a
dangerous situation, ultimately resulting in her injury.
 
Reliance on representation was a substantial factor in
causing harm:
Finally, Plaintiff alleges that
her reliance on Defendant’s representations was a substantial factor leading to
her injuries. Plaintiff states that she “never would have agreed to take the
job” had she known the truth about Wiley’s deficient care and the risks
associated with working with an untrained and unsocialized horse (SAC ¶¶ 58,
60). Plaintiff further alleges that working with a horse in Wiley’s condition
required an expert trainer, not an exerciser or walker like herself (SAC ¶ 34).
These allegations sufficiently establish that Plaintiff’s reliance on
Defendant’s representations substantially contributed to the harm she suffered.
 
B.   
Motion to strike
Code Civ. Proc. §436: “The court
may, upon a motion made pursuant to Section 435, or at any time in its
discretion, and upon terms it deems proper:
(a) Strike out any irrelevant,
false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading.
(b) Strike out all or any part of
any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a
court rule, or an order of the court.”
Code Civ. Proc. §431.10:
“(a) A material allegation in a
pleading is one essential to the claim or defense and which could not be
stricken from the pleading without leaving it insufficient as to that claim or
defense.
(b) An immaterial allegation in a
pleading is any of the following:
(1) An allegation that is not
essential to the statement of a claim or defense.
(2) An allegation that is neither
pertinent to nor supported by an otherwise sufficient claim or defense.
(3) A demand for judgment
requesting relief not supported by the allegations of the complaint or
cross-complaint.
(c) An ‘immaterial allegation’
means irrelevant matter’ as that term is used in Section 436.”
Punitive damages may be imposed
where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has been
guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice. (Cal. Civ. Code § 3294 (a).) “Malice”
is conduct intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or
despicable conduct which is carried on with a willful and conscious disregard
of the rights or safety of others. (Cal. Civ. Code § 3294 (c)(1).) “‘Punitive
damages are proper only when the tortious conduct rises to levels of extreme
indifference to the plaintiff’s rights, a level which decent citizens should
not have to tolerate.’ [Citation.]” (Lackner v. North, 135 Cal. App. 4th 1188,
1210 (2006).) “As amended to include [despicable], the [Civil Code section
3294] plainly indicates that absent an intent to injure the plaintiff, ‘malice’
requires more than a ‘willful and conscious’ disregard of the plaintiffs’
interests. The additional component of ‘despicable conduct’ must be found.”
(College Hospital Inc. v. Superior Court, 8 Cal. 4th 704, 725 (1994).) The
statute’s reference to despicable conduct represents a “new substantive
limitation on punitive damage awards.” (Id.) Despicable conduct is “conduct
which is so vile, base, contemptible, miserable, wretched or loathsome that it
would be looked down upon and despised by ordinary decent people. Such conduct
has been described as ‘having the character of outrage frequently associated
with crime.’” (Tomaselli v. Transamerica Ins. Co., 25 Cal. App. 4th
1269, 1287 (1994).)
Further, “[t]here must be evidence
that defendant acted with knowledge of the probable dangerous consequences to
plaintiff’s interests and deliberately failed to avoid these consequences.” (Flyer’s
Body Shop Profit Sharing Plan v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., 185 Cal. App. 3d
1149, 1155 (1986); see also Angie M. v. Superior Court, 37 Cal. App.
4th 1217, 1228 (1995) [“Conscious disregard for the safety of another may
be sufficient where the defendant is aware of the probably dangerous
consequences of his or her conduct and he or she willfully fails to avoid such
consequences”].)
Defendant moves to strike the
following:
1.    
 ¶64: “Pursuant
to Civil Code §3294, the direct and proximate cause and legal result of the
fraud and intentional misrepresentations made by Ms. Lee to Plaintiff, warrant
the recovery of exemplary/punitive damages by Plaintiff in an amount sufficient
to punish Ms. Lee for her malice, and for her conscious disregard for the
safety of others, and to deter Ms. Lee from engaging in future like conduct.”;
and
2.    
Prayer for Relief: ¶4:
“For exemplary / punitive damages as to Fraud cause of action;”
 
Defendant contends that Plaintiff’s
allegations fail to meet the threshold of “malice, oppression, or fraud” and
thus do not warrant an award of punitive damages. Specifically, Defendant
argues that none of the facts pleaded support a finding of despicable conduct
or conscious disregard for Plaintiff’s safety, as required by section 3294.
Plaintiff in opposition, contends
that the SAC sufficiently alleges facts to support a claim for punitive damages
under section 3294, specifically under the “despicable conduct” standard for
malice. Plaintiff emphasizes that, at the pleading stage, they are not required
to prove entitlement to punitive damages; instead, they must only present
allegations that, if assumed true, would justify such damages.
Plaintiff has alleged specific
facts that, if true, would meet the standard for “despicable conduct.”
Plaintiff’s claims that Defendant knowingly misled her into working with a
potentially dangerous horse, in disregard for Plaintiff’s safety, support a
basis for punitive damages on the grounds of fraud and malice. Further, the
allegations of Defendant’s purported history of neglect and a “bad reputation”
for maltreatment further support the claim that Defendant consciously
disregarded Plaintiff’s safety.
Given the foregoing, Plaintiff has
adequately supported her request for punitive damages. Therefore, the Court
DENIES Defendant’s motion to strike Paragraph 64 and the request for punitive
damages in the Prayer for Relief from the SAC.
