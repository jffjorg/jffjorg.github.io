And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case, which involves a dispute between Plaintiff Barri Whittaker and Defendant Katherine Lee over alleged negligence and fraud. The dispute arises from an incident involving Defendant's horse, Wiley, in which Plaintiff was injured.

The judge has overruled Defendant's demurrer to Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint, which alleged that Plaintiff was injured due to Defendant's misrepresentations regarding Wiley's training, care, and safety. The judge has also denied Defendant's motion to strike portions of the complaint, finding that the allegations are sufficient to state a cause of action.

The judge has also denied Defendant's motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages, finding that Plaintiff has adequately supported its request for damages. The judge has noted that Plaintiff's allegations support a basis for punitive damages on the grounds of fraud and malice, and that Defendant's purported history of neglect and a "bad reputation" for maltreatment further support the claim that Defendant consciously disregarded Plaintiff's safety.

The judge has ordered that the case proceed to trial, and that Defendant is to give notice and provide an answer within 10 days of the hearing.
