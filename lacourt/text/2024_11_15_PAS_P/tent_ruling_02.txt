 Case Number:  24NNCV00496    Hearing Date:   November 15, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO COMPEL THE DEPOSITION OF DEFENDANT’S PERSON MOST QUALIFIED
and MONETARY SANCTIONSI.          INTRODUCTION
            This is a
lemon law action concerning a 2022 Chevrolet Silverado. Plaintiff Carlos
Izarraras Cruz (“Plaintiff”) initiated this action against Defendant General
Motors, LLC (“GM”), alleging violations of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty
Act.
On October 16, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the present motion to compel the deposition of GM’s Person Most Qualified
(“PMQ”) to address issues related to the vehicle's warranty, repair history,
and GM’s lemon law policies. GM filed an opposition on November 1, 2024, and
Plaintiff submitted a reply on November 15, 2024.
Moving Party’s Argument
            Plaintiff
moves to compel the deposition of GM’s PMQ, along with the production of
documents. Plaintiff contends that, despite multiple deposition notices and
eight meet-and-confer efforts, GM has not provided any dates for the PMQ
deposition. Plaintiff also argues that GM’s objections are baseless and appear
to be intended primarily to delay the discovery process. Consequently,
Plaintiff seeks an order compelling the deposition and imposing monetary
sanctions on Defendant for failing to comply with its discovery obligations.
Opposition
GM opposes the motion, asserting
that Plaintiff’s deposition notice is overbroad and seeks irrelevant
information. GM contends that it has already provided substantial discovery,
including hundreds of pages of documents, and has offered to produce a PMQ to
testify on relevant topics. Additionally, GM maintains that Plaintiff did not
engage in a genuine meet-and-confer process and instead prematurely filed this
motion.
Reply
In reply, Plaintiff reiterates that
GM has not provided any dates for the PMQ deposition and has refused to engage
in meet-and-confer discussions. Plaintiff asserts that they have made good
faith efforts to resolve this matter informally and that GM’s continued refusal
to cooperate necessitates court intervention.
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
            Code Civ.
Proc. §2025.450 provides relief where a party fails to appear for deposition
without having served a valid objection. It provides as follows:
(a) If, after service of a
deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing
agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that
is a party under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid objection
under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it,
or to produce for inspection any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the
notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and
testimony, and the production for inspection of any document, electronically
stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.
(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with both of
the following:
(1) [omitted]
(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the
deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored information, or
things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the
petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.
. . .
            (g)(1) If a
motion under subdivision (a) is granted, the court shall impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the
party who noticed the deposition and against the deponent or the party with
whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust.
(2) On motion of any other party who, in person or by
attorney, attended at the time and place specified in the deposition notice in
the expectation that the deponent's testimony would be taken, the court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
in favor of that party and against the deponent or the party with whom the
deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust..
 
Plaintiff’s objections
The following objections are
overruled: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
 
III.      ANALYSIS
            Plaintiff
moves to compel the deposition of GM’s PMQ, asserting that despite repeated
attempts to obtain deposition dates, GM has failed to respond with availability
and has ignored multiple meet-and-confer efforts. Plaintiff argues that GM’s
conduct has delayed discovery, necessitating court intervention to compel the
deposition. Plaintiff first served a Notice of Deposition for GM’s PMQ on April
22, 2024 (Brande Decl., ¶ 5; Exh. A). On May 10, 2024, GM responded with
objections (Brande Decl., ¶ 6; Exh. A) On May 13, 2024, Plaintiff called GM to
meet and confer but was unable to leave a voicemail. Plaintiff then followed up
with written correspondence addressing GM’s objections and proposing a
compromise to withdraw the category related to other vehicle buybacks.
Plaintiff also offered to execute a protective order to facilitate the
production of GM’s lemon law policies and procedures, suggesting a Zoom or
phone meeting to resolve any issues. GM did not respond to this outreach
(Brande Decl., ¶ 7).
On August 15, 2024, Plaintiff
served a First Amended Notice of Deposition, officially withdrawing the
category regarding other vehicle buybacks (Brande Decl., ¶ 8; Exh. D). GM
responded on August 29, 2024, with a nearly identical set of objections. Later
that day, Plaintiff again called GM and left a voicemail, followed by written
correspondence reiterating the proposed compromise and suggesting a protective
order.  GM again failed to respond (Brande Decl., ¶¶ 9-10; Exhs. E, F).
Plaintiff served a Second Amended
Notice of Deposition on September 4, 2024, clarifying the deposition topics and
maintaining the offer to execute a protective order (Brande Decl., ¶ 11; Exh.
G). On September 18, 2024, GM filed another set of objections like its prior
responses (Brande Decl., ¶ 12; Exh. H). That same day, Plaintiff attempted once
more to meet and confer by phone and in writing, repeating requests for GM’s
PMQ’s availability and suggesting GM choose its preferred dates. GM did not
respond (Brande Decl., ¶ 13; Exh. I).
Plaintiff then submitted a request
for an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) on September 20, 2024, and again
reached out to GM to coordinate availability, proposing several dates. GM did
not respond, nor did it participate in scheduling the IDC (Brande Decl., ¶¶
14-15; Exhs. J, K).
GM argues that Plaintiff failed to
meet and confer adequately by serving deposition notices without waiting for
GM’s response. GM states that Plaintiff did not wait for responses after the
initial May 13, 2024, meet-and-confer request or after follow-up efforts on
August 15, 2024, and September 4, 2024. GM contends that Plaintiff’s
meet-and-confer efforts were insufficient and failed to address objections or
narrow the deposition scope to the subject vehicle (Dobson Decl., ¶¶ 3, 5, 7,
8).
However, Plaintiff’s declaration
and deposition notices indicate significant gaps of time between each notice
and meet-and-confer communication, with no substantive response from GM. Given
GM’s repeated lack of substantive response or proposal of alternative
deposition dates, a question arises as to the reasonable length of time
Plaintiff was expected to wait to address GM’s objections. Parties are expected
to respond within a reasonable period, but here, Plaintiff’s documentation
shows that substantial time passed without GM’s engagement.
Under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2025.450, subdivision (a), a party may compel attendance at a
deposition if the opposing party fails to appear after proper notice. Here,
Plaintiff has satisfied statutory requirements by filing this motion,
demonstrating good cause, and submitting a declaration detailing GM’s lack of
cooperation. Plaintiff’s documentation shows a consistent effort to meet and
confer, including compromises to limit the scope of the deposition and
proposals to address GM’s objections.
The Court finds that GM’s failure
to engage in scheduling a deposition lacks substantial justification. GM’s
repeated refusal to participate in meet-and-confer discussions or provide
alternative dates for the deposition has unnecessarily delayed the discovery
process.
Accordingly. Plaintiff’s motion to
compel the deposition of GM’s PMQ is GRANTED.
Sanctions
Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030, subdivision (a), authorizes the Court to impose a monetary sanction
for misuse of the discovery process, requiring the offending party, or their
attorney, to pay the reasonable expenses incurred by the opposing party,
including attorney’s fees. If a monetary sanction is authorized by any
provision of this title, the Court must impose that sanction unless it finds
that the offending party acted with substantial justification or that the
imposition of the sanction would be unjust.
When a motion to compel under
Section 2025.450(a) is granted, the Court is required to impose monetary
sanctions in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against the
deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the Court
finds that the subject of the sanction acted with substantial justification or
that the circumstances render the imposition of the sanction unjust. (C.C.P. §
2025.450(c)(1)). The purpose of discovery sanctions is to prevent abuse of the
discovery process and to correct the problem presented. Do v. Superior Court
(2003) 109 Cal. App. 4th 1210, 1213.
Plaintiff seeks monetary sanctions
of $2,625, based on time spent reviewing GM’s Opposition, preparing Plaintiff’s
Reply, and anticipated attendance at the hearing. Plaintiff estimates that
seven hours have been dedicated to meeting and conferring on this issue,
preparing the motion, and related documentation, at a rate of $375 per hour.
            Code of Civil Procedure
section 2025.450, subdivision (c)(1), requires the Court to impose monetary
sanctions when granting a motion to compel unless the opposing party demonstrates
substantial justification. Here, as discussed above, GM has not provided such
justification, and their failure to engage in good faith discovery efforts
supports Plaintiff’s request for sanctions for the time spent preparing this
motion, attending the hearing, and filing reply.
The Court finds that Plaintiff’s
counsel’s hourly rate of $375 is reasonable but considers the claimed seven
hours to be excessive for the work involved. Based on the nature of the filings
and the meet-and-confer efforts, the Court finds that five hours is a
reasonable amount of time related to filing the motion, responding, and
attending the hearing. Accordingly, the Court awards sanctions in the amount of
$1,875.
            The Court
GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,875.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION AND ORDER
             Motion to
compel deposition of GM’s PMQ is GRANTED. GM is to produce the PMQ for deposition within 30 days of this order.       Plaintiff’s request for monetary
sanctions is GRANTED in the amount of $1,875, payable within 30 days of this
order.
             Plaintiff
is to give notice.
