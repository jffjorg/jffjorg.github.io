And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is considering the motions filed by the parties in this case. The Defendant's oppositions were late, but the Judge is exercising its discretion to consider them anyway since the Plaintiffs have replied to the motions and do not appear to have been prejudiced. The Judge also notes that a motion to compel initial discovery responses does not need to show good cause, meeting and conferring, or timely filing, and that the Defendant failed to file a motion for relief from waiver of objections. As a result, the Judge declines to consider the Defendant's argument on relief from waiver of objections.
