I.        Background 
In this lawsuit, brought under
the Song-Beverly Consumer Warrant Act, Plaintiffs Francisco Perez Ramirez and
Mario Perez Garcia Del Valle (together, “Plaintiffs”) allege that they entered
into a warranty contract with FCA US LLC (“Defendant”) regarding a 2022 RAM
2500, which suffers from various defects and has not been repaired after a
reasonable number of attempts. Plaintiffs’ complaint asserts causes of action
against Defendant for (1) breach of express warrant, in violation of the
Song-Beverly Act and (2) negligent repair.
On August 21, 2024, Plaintiffs
served various discovery requests on Defendant, including requests for
admission, interrogatories, and requests for production of documents.
Plaintiffs claim they have not received sufficient responses from Defendant and
thus have filed four motions, seeking orders that requests for admissions be
deemed admitted and compelling Defendant to provide Code-complaint responses,
without objections, to interrogatories and requests for production of documents.[FN1] For the reasons stated herein, the motions are granted.
 
II.      Discussion
A.       Legal Standards 
Responses to requests for
admission, interrogatories, and requests for production of documents are due 30
days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.250, subd. (a).) An unverified
discovery response is treated as no response. (Steele v. Totah (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 545, 549; Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206
Cal.App.3d 632, 636-637.) 
As to requests for admission, “[i]f
a party to whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely
response, . . .[t]he requesting party may move for an order that the
genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted. . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)
“The court shall make this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the
requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the
motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in
substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. . .” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subd. (c).) “It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary
sanction . . . on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure
to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
As to interrogatories and
requests for production of documents, “[i]f a party . . . fails to serve a
timely response . . . [t]he party [propounding the interrogatories or making
the demand for production] may move for an order compelling response[s].” (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290, subd. (b), 2031.300,
subd. (b).) “The court shall impose a monetary sanction .
. . against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes
a motion to compel a response to interrogatories [or a demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling], unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300,
subd. (c).)
 
B.       Relevant Facts
Plaintiffs’ counsel Armando Lopez (“Lopez”)
represents that despite serving the requested discovery on August 21, 2024, Defendant
failed to respond to the subject discovery as of the filing date of the motion
and never requested additional time or provided any explanation for the failure
to respond. (Lopez Decl., ¶¶ 3, 4, 6, Exhs. A and B.) 
While Defendant concedes that it did not serve
timely responses, Defendant’s counsel John R. Rafter attests that Defendant
served verified responses, including objections, rendering the instant motions
moot. (Rafter Decl., ¶ 9.) While Rafter’s declaration does not contain the date
that responses were served, the memorandum of points and authorities states
responses were served on October 9, 2024. (Opposition 1:16-17.) 
The parties dispute whether verified responses have
been provided. In the face of contrary declarations regarding verifications,
the Court has turned to the documentary evidence, including the exhibit
attached to Rafter’s declaration. While Defendant has provided what purports to
be the first page of its response to Request for Admissions (Rafter Decl., Ex.
2), Defendant has not provided the entire response, including proof of the verifications
and proof of service. Accordingly, based on the evidence presented, Defendant
has not demonstrated it provided verified discovery responses. 
C.       Discussion
1.       Plaintiff’s Motion to Deem Requests
for Admission Admitted
 
Plaintiffs move the Court for an order that the truth of
each matter specified in Plaintiffs’
Requests for Admission, Set No. One be deemed admitted and conclusively
established against Defendant. Plaintiffs also seek monetary sanctions against
Defendant and its attorneys of record in the amount of $1,700.00.
As noted above, Defendant concedes that it did not
provide timely responses. However, Defendant contends that the motion is moot
in light of the responses it subsequently provided.[FN2]
The Court rejects Defendant’s argument for two
reasons. First, Defendant has not demonstrated that verified responses have been provided, as it only attached the
first page of its response and not the verifications. Second, even if
verifications were provided, Defendant has waived its objections, having failed
to file any motions seeking relief from the waiver as required by Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a)(1)-(2).[FN3] 
The motion is granted. Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure § 2033.280, subdivision (b), the Court orders that the truth of each matter specified in
Plaintiffs’ Requests for Admission, Set No. One be deemed admitted against
Defendant and any objections be waived.
