  Case Number:  21PSCV00806    Hearing Date:   January 7, 2025    Dept:  H Bo v. Hong, et al., Case No. 21PSCV00806

ORDER ON MOTIONS
TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
Background
Plaintiff Weng Bo (“Bo”) alleges
as follows:
Prior to
June 2, 2016, Xiaowei Hong (“William”) approached Bo for a $1 million loan to
purchase inventory and equipment for Fullerton Cabinet Inc. (“FCI”) and KB
Depot Inc. (“KBDI”). On or about June 2, 2016, Bo loaned $1 million to FCI
through William in a representative capacity for FCI, with 0.85% monthly
interest. William executed a Promissory Note on behalf of FCI for said loan. Between
June 2, 2016 and January 29, 2021, William only repaid a portion of the loan.
On May 1,
2017, William filed a certificate of dissolution of FCI, representing therein
that all company debts and liabilities had been actually paid or provided for
as far as company assets permitted. Prior to January 29, 2021, William approached
Bo for additional funds needed to purchase inventory for KBDI. On January 29,
2021, William made and executed a “Guaranty for Stock Ownership” in a
representative capacity for KBDI, wherein Bo would provide funds to William to
purchase inventory for KBDI in return for 51% shares of KBDI until repayment of
the debt was confirmed by Bo. Bo provided these funds but was not repaid or
given the 51% shares.
On December 28, 2022, Bo filed a
Third Amended Complaint (the “Operative Complaint”), asserting causes of action
against William, KBDI, FCI, and Does 1-100 for: (1) declaratory relief, (2)
declaratory relief, (3) breach of written contract, (4) breach of written
contract, (5) money had and received, (6) breach of fiduciary duties, (7)
accounting, and (8) preliminary and permanent injunction.
On
March 7, 2023, the Court sustained William, KBDI, and FCI’s demurrer to the
first and second causes of action in the Operative Complaint, without leave to
amend.
On
April 3, 2023, William, KBDI, and FCI filed a cross-complaint, asserting causes
of action against Bo and Roes 1-10 for: (1) fraud and (2) conspiracy to commit
fraud.
Pending
before the Court is WHGC, P.L.C.’s motion to be relieved as counsel of record
for William, KBDI, and FCI.
 
Discussion
WHGC,
P.L.C. (the “Firm”) seeks to
be relieved as counsel of record for William, KBDI, and FCI (collectively, the
“Clients”).
 
Notice
At the outset, the Court notes
that Motions #1 (i.e., as to William) and #2 (i.e., as to KBDI) were originally
set for hearing on January 6, 2024. On November 19, 2024, the Court issued a
“Notice Re: Continuance of Hearing and Order,” wherein the January 6, 2025,
scheduled hearing on Motions #1 and #2 was reset to January 7, 2025; notice was
given to counsel.
There is nothing on the docket reflecting
that moving counsel has provided notice of the rescheduled hearing date on
Motions #1 and #2 to the Clients; as such, the following ruling as to Motions
#1 and #2 is contingent upon the moving
party’s filing of proofs of service at or before the time of the January 7,
2025 hearing reflecting that notice of the continued hearing date was provided
to the Clients.
 
Merits
The Court has discretion to
allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided
that there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly
process of justice. (See Ramirez v.
Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398.)
California Rules of Court, rule
3.1362 requires (1) a notice of motion and motion directed to the client (made
on the Notice of Motion and Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in
general terms and without compromising the confidentiality of the
attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of Civil Procedure §
284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under section 284(1) (made on the
Declaration in Support of Attorney's
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-052)); (3) service of the
notice of motion and motion, the declaration, and the proposed order on the
client and on all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) a
proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil
form (MC-053)). The court may delay the effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules Court, rule 3.1362(e).)
Attorney Michael York (“York”) identically attests, in relevant part,
that “Defendant has breached his[/its] obligation to his[/its] attorneys as to
the payment of attorney’s fees and costs and Defendant’s attorneys have given
Defendant multiple warnings that Defendant’s attorneys will withdraw unless
Defendant fulfills his[/its] obligations.”
York states that he served the Clients by mail at the Clients’ last
known addresses with copies of the motion papers served with his declaration
and that he has confirmed within the past 30 days that the addresses are
current, by telephone.
The motions are not opposed. The
Court determines that the requirements of Rules of Court Rule 3.1362 enumerated
above have been sufficiently met.
Accordingly, the motions are
granted, effective upon the filing of
a proof of service showing service of the signed order upon the Clients at the
Clients’ last known addresses. 
The Court
notes that KBDI and FCI are corporations; accordingly, the Court will set an
Order to Show Cause Re: Representation of Corporate Defendants for February 4,
2025, at 10 a.m.
In light of the defendants’
uncertain representation status, the Court also vacates the Final Status Conference
(that had been set for January 21, 2025), as well as the Jury Trial (that had
been set for February 4, 2025). The Court sets a Case Management Conference and
Trial Setting Conference for February 4, 2025, at 10 a.m.
