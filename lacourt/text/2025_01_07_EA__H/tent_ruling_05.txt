[FN1] Defendant’s oppositions were not
timely as they were due December 23, 2024 and not filed until December 26,
2024. However, as Plaintiffs have substantively replied and appear to have
suffered no prejudice from the late oppositions, the Court exercises its
discretion to consider the late oppositions in ruling on the merits of the
instant motions. 


[FN2] As to Defendant’s argument that
Plaintiffs failed to meet and confer before filing this motion, a motion to
compel initial discovery responses
need only show that discovery was properly served on the opposing party, the
time to respond expired, and no response was served. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905906; Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290 (compelling initial interrogatory responses), 2031.300
(compelling initial document requests).) A motion to compel initial discovery
responses need not show good cause, meeting and conferring, or timely filing,
and need not be accompanied by a separate statement. (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pac. Healthcare Consultants
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.).) 


[FN3] Because Defendant
failed to file a motion for relief from waiver of objections as required by
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a)(1)-(2), the Court declines to consider Defendant’s argument that it has met the requirements for relief from waiver of objections.
