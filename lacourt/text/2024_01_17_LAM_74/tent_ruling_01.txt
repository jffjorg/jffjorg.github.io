  Case Number:  20STCV09612    Hearing Date:   January 17, 2024    Dept:  74 Glenn Feldman
v. Fraser Ross, et al.
 
Plaintiff’s
Glenn Feldman’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production
of Documents (Set Three) from Defendant Fraser Ross
 
The court considered the moving papers. No opposition was
timely filed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b) [“All papers opposing a
motion . . . shall be filed with the court and a copy served on each party at
least nine court days . . . before the hearing.”].)
BACKGROUND
            This action arises from
a contractual dispute.
            On March 9, 2020,
Plaintiff Glenn Feldman (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against Defendant Fraser
Ross (Defendant) and others. In the complaint, Plaintiff alleged the following
causes of action: intentional misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation,
breach of fiduciary duty, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair
dealing, constructive trust, accounting, and fraudulent conversion.
            On August 16, 2023,
Plaintiff propounded requests for production (set three) (RFPs) on Defendant.
            On September 19, 2023,
Defendant served responses to the RFPs at issue. Plaintiff was dissatisfied.
            The parties met and
conferred to no avail.
            On December 5, 2023,
Plaintiff filed this motion to compel further responses to RFP Nos. 106-253.
            On January 4, 2024,
Defendant served Plaintiff with further responses and produced responsive
documents.
LEGAL STANDARD
            A propounding party may move for an
order compelling a further response to a demand for inspection if the
propounding party deems that an answer or statement of compliance is evasive or
incomplete, or that an objection is “without merit or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a).) Such a
motion must set forth specific facts showing good cause for the discovery
sought and be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2031.310, subd. (b), 2031.210, subd. (b).) ¿  
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff seeks further responses to
RFP Nos. 106-253. As a preliminary matter, the court finds Plaintiff has
demonstrated good cause for this motion and the parties have sufficiently met
and conferred. Given Defendant’s further responses and production of responsive
documents on January 4, the court finds this motion moot. However, sanctions are warranted under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2031.310, subdivision (h). In his untimely opposition,
Defendant has not persuaded the court that substantial justification existed
for the delayed responses and production. Moreover, Plaintiff’s counsels’
hourly rates are reasonable and they have sufficiently substantiated their
request for attorney fees. (Kay Decl., ¶ 8.) 
CONCLUSION
                Based on the foregoing, the court finds
Plaintiff’s motion to compel further discovery moot. The court grants
Plaintiff’s counsel’s request for sanctions. Defendant shall pay Plaintiff’s
counsel $1,012 ($562 + $450) by February 16, 2024, an amount less than Plaintiff
requested because this motion duplicates much of the work on Plaintiff’s motion
to compel heard on January 16, 2024.
            Plaintiff shall give notice.
