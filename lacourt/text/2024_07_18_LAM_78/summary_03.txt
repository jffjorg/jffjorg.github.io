And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a request for default judgment against Bryan Rubio, who allegedly defaulted on a loan agreement with Pablo Gomez Luna and Lucas Logistics, Inc. The plaintiffs are seeking $18,219.98 in principal damages, $18,726.56 in interest, $2,250 in attorney fees, and $585 in costs. However, the court is denying the request for default judgment due to several defects in the plaintiffs' declaration and documentation. Specifically, the declaration is not sworn, there is no interest computation provided to support the interest calculation, and there is no statutory or contractual basis to recover attorney fees. The court is ordering the plaintiffs to submit a new default judgment package correcting these defects and is continuing the OSC re entry of default judgment. Failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal.
