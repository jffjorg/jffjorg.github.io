And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's default judgment packet and has scheduled a hearing to show cause why the complaint should not be dismissed and/or the plaintiff's counsel should not be sanctioned. The reason for the denial is that the exhibits included with the default judgment packet were insufficient to demonstrate damages and did not include proper foundation in the plaintiff's declaration. Additionally, no interest calculation was provided for the default judgment packet filed with the court on February 23, 2024. The hearing is scheduled for April 26, 2024, at 8:30 AM in Department 71 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
