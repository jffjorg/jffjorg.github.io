And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for an order permitting her to conduct limited discovery related to the defendants' anti-SLAPP motion. The defendants had filed a special motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's complaint, alleging retaliation and unequal pay. The plaintiff sought to conduct discovery to gather evidence to deny that certain conversations were protected activity under California Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16 and to gather evidence to bolster her opposition to the anti-SLAPP motion. However, the judge found that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate good cause for lifting the statutory stay of discovery and that the requested discovery was not narrowly aimed at opposing the anti-SLAPP issues presented in the defendants' motion. The judge also noted that the plaintiff's motion did not provide specific proposed deposition notices, document requests, or other proposed written discovery, making it impossible to determine whether the requested discovery satisfied the statutory requirements.
