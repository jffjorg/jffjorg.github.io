BACKGROUND
On December 22, 2020, Plaintiff Douglas
Da Silva McGlew (“Plaintiff”) commenced this personal injury action against
Defendant Michelle Carriger (“Defendant”) based on a motor vehicle accident. 
On April 11, 2024, Defendant filed
the instant motions to compel discovery response to form interrogatories and request
for production of documents, sets one. Plaintiff has not opposed.
 LEGAL STANDARD
Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the
court may make an order compelling responses. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300; Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)   A party that
fails to serve timely responses waives any objections to the request, including
ones based on privilege or the protection of attorney work product.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a),
2031.300, subd. (a).)  Unlike a motion to
compel further responses, a motion to
compel responses is not subject to a 45-day time limit and the propounding
party has no meet and confer obligations. 
(Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at
p. 404.)
Where the court grants a motion to compel responses, sanctions shall be
imposed against the party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel, unless the party acted with substantial justification or the sanction
would otherwise be unjust.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).) The court may award sanctions under the
Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even
where no opposition is filed, or the requested discovery was provided to the
moving party after the motion was filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348(a).)
DISCUSSION
             Defendant
moves to compel Plaintiff’s responses to form interrogatories and
request for production of documents, sets one.
 Defendant served the subject discovery on Plaintiff on
November 28, 2023. (Meshkinfam Decls., ¶4, Exh. A.) To date, Plaintiff has not
responded to the discovery requests. (Id. at ¶9.) Accordingly, the
motions are GRANTED.
 Sanctions are warranted as the motion is granted, and Plaintiff
has failed to respond to discovery and the instant motions. The Court finds
that $680 (2 hrs. x $250/hr., plus $180 in filing fees) is a reasonable amount
for sanctions for both motions total to be imposed against Plaintiff and
counsel of record. (Id. at ¶10.)
 Based on the foregoing, the motions are GRANTED. Plaintiff
to serve code-compliant discovery responses without objections within 15 days
of Defendant giving notice of this Order. 
Sanctions are imposed against Plaintiff and counsel of record in the
amount of $680 total payable within 30 days of Defendant giving notice of this
Order.
           Defendant is ordered to give notice
of this ruling.
