```

And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the Defendant's motion for terminating sanctions and grants the motion for monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,665 against Plaintiff's counsel. The court finds that the Plaintiff's failure to comply with the discovery order was not intentional and does not constitute a history of discovery abuse. However, the failure to comply with the order merits the imposition of sanctions.
