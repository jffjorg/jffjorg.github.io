  Case Number:  20STCV37961    Hearing Date:   May 16, 2024    Dept:  T Motion for Terminating SanctionsThe court
considered the moving papers and a May 14, 2024 declaration from Plaintiff’s
counsel.Tentative Ruling:  Deny as to terminating sanctions.  Grant as to monetary sanctions.BACKGROUND On October 2, 2020,
Plaintiff Jose Tamayo (“Plaintiff”) commenced this personal injury action
against Defendants Adam Johnston and Maria Cervantes (“Defendants”) based on a
motor vehicle accident.  On December 6,
2023, the Court ordered Plaintiff to provide responses without objection to
Defendants’ request for form interrogatories and request for production within
20 days of the order.  On April 12, 2024,
Defendants filed the instant motion for terminating sanctions. On May 14, 2024,
Plaintiff’s counsel filed a declaration admitting fault for the failure to
comply with this Court’s order of December 6, 2023 and representing to the Court that Plaintiff had complied with this Court's discovery order.
LEGAL STANDARD
           Under CCP § 2023.030(d), the Court may impose terminating sanctions by
“an order striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings of any party
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process” and “an order rendering a
judgment by default against that party.” The Court must consider the
alternatives available, which include intermediate sanctions available under
CCP § 2023.030, namely increased monetary sanctions, issue sanctions, or
evidence sanctions.
“Dismissal is a proper
sanction to punish the failure to comply with a rule or an order only if the
court's authority cannot be vindicated through the imposition of a less severe
alternative.” (Rail Services of America v. State Comp. Ins. Fund (2003)
110 Cal.App.4th 323, 331. See also Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem
(2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-80 [“A decision to order terminating sanctions
should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a
history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not
produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in
imposing the ultimate sanction.”]; R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton,
Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 496 [“The power to impose discovery
sanctions is a broad discretion subject to reversal only for arbitrary,
capricious, or whimsical action.  Only two facts are absolutely
prerequisite to imposition of the sanction: (1) there must be a failure to
comply ... and (2) the failure must be willful.”].) “We recognize that
terminating sanctions are to be used sparingly, only when the trial court
concludes that lesser sanctions would not bring about the compliance of the
offending party.” (R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999)
75 Cal.App.4th 486, 496.) “Discovery sanctions must be tailored in order to
remedy the offending party's discovery abuse, should not give the aggrieved
party more than what it is entitled to, and should not be used to punish the
offending party.” (Karlsson v. Ford Motor Co. (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th
1202, 1217.)DISCUSSIONDefendants move for terminating
sanctions based upon Plaintiff’s failure to comply with the Court’s December 6,
2023 order. Defendant also requests monetary sanctions in the amount $1,664
against Plaintiff and counsel of record.  Here, the Court is satisfied with Plaintiff’s
counsel’s representation that his failure to comply with this Court’s order was
not intentional and the Court does not find that there is a history of discovery abuse that would merit terminating sanctions.  However, the failure to comply with this Court's order does merit the imposition of sanctions.  CCP § 2023.010(g) and CCP § 2023.030(a). Here, the Court finds the requested sanctions amount of
$1,665 to be reasonable under the circumstances.CONCLUSIONBased
on the foregoing, the motion for terminating sanctions is denied.  The motion for monetary sanctions is granted
in the amount of $1,665.00 against Plaintiff’s counsel.  Sanctions to be paid within 30 days of defendant
giving notice of this Court’s order.   Defendant to give notice.
