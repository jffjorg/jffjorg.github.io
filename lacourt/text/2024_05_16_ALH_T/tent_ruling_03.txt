BACKGROUND      
On April 5, 2022, Plaintiff Juana
Olmos filed a complaint against Defendants GDL Delivery Corp., Rafael Famoso
Campos, and Lucio Famoso Campos, alleging a cause of action for negligence,
stemming from a vehicle collision that occurred on May 21, 2020. 
On April 25, 2022, Plaintiffs Lee Shai Chiu Wu and
Josephine Wu filed a complaint against Defendants GDL Delivery Corp., Rafael
Famoso Campos, and Lucio Famoso Campos, alleging causes of action for motor
vehicle and general negligence, stemming from a vehicle collision that occurred
on May 21, 2020.
On May 23, 2023, these cases were consolidated.
 
On April 4, 2024,
Defendants filed this motion for leave to file an amended answer. No opposition
has been filed. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
  California Code of Civil Procedure section¿473,
subdivision¿(a)(1) provides, in relevant part: “The court may, in furtherance
of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow a party¿to amend any
pleading or proceeding by adding or striking out the name of any party, or by
correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any other respect;
and may, upon like terms, enlarge the time for answer or demurrer.¿ The court
may likewise, in its discretion, after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon
any terms as may be just, an amendment to any pleading or proceeding in other
particulars; and may upon like terms allow an answer to be made after the time
limited by this code.”¿ 
 
“This discretion should be exercised liberally in favor of
amendments, for judicial policy favors resolution of all disputed matters in
the same lawsuit.”¿¿(Kittredge Sports Co. v. Superior Court¿(1989) 213
Cal.App.3d 1045, 1047.)¿ Ordinarily, the court will not consider the validity
of the proposed amended pleading in ruling on a motion for leave since grounds
for a demurrer or motion to strike are premature.¿ The court, however, does
have discretion to deny leave to amend where a proposed amendment fails to state
a valid cause of action as a matter of law and the defect cannot be cured by
further amendment.¿¿(California Casualty General Ins. Co. v. Superior
Court¿(1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 274, 281¿(overruled on other grounds by¿Kransco¿v.
American Empire Surplus Lines Ins. Co.¿(2000) 23 Cal.4th 390).)¿ 
“ ‘[I]t is an abuse of discretion to deny leave to
amend where the opposing party was not misled or prejudiced by the amendment.’
(Atkinson v. Elk Corp. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 759-761.) Prejudice
exists where the amendment would require delaying the trial, resulting in loss
of critical evidence, or added costs of preparation such as an increased burden
of discovery. (Magpali v. Farmers Group, Inc. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471,
486-488.) 
Under¿California Rules of Court¿Rule 3.1324(a), a motion to
amend a pleading shall (1) include a copy of the proposed amendment or amended
pleading, which must be serially numbered to differentiate it from previous
pleadings or amendments; (2) state what allegations in the previous pleading
are proposed to be deleted, if any, and where, by page, paragraph and line
number, the deleted allegations are located; and (3) state what allegations are
proposed to be added to the previous pleading, if any,¿and where, by page,
paragraph, and line number, the additional allegations are located.¿ 
 
Under¿California Rule of Court¿Rule 3.1324(b), a separate
declaration must accompany the motion and must specify (1) the effect of the
amendment; (2) why the amendment is necessary and proper; (3) when the facts
giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and (4)¿the reasons why
the request for amendment was not made earlier.¿  
DISCUSSION
Defendants seek a court order
permitting them to file an Amended Answer to add an affirmative defense under
Civil Code section 3333.4 (Proposition 213), in light of new documents produced
by State Farm Insurance Company on April 3, 2024, indicating that the
automobile insurance policy identified in the Traffic Collision Report for the
vehicle operated by Plaintiff Olmos at the time of the May 21, 2020 automobile
accident was cancelled effective April 15, 2020. (Sellers Decl., ¶ 10.) Section
3333.4 "prohibits uninsured motorists ... from collecting noneconomic
damages in any action arising out of the operation or use of a motor
vehicle." (Yoshioka v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 972, 978.) 
Defendants have
complied with CRC Rule 3.1324 by including a copy of the proposed Amended
Answer and indicating what allegations are proposed to be added to the previous
pleading.  (Sellers Decl., Exh. 9.)  Defendants also state that they
discovered the applicability of this additional defense on April 3, 2024 when
State Farm produced documents showing that Plaintiff’s insurance policy was
canceled at the time of the collision. This is sufficient to explain why the
amendment is necessary and proper, when the facts giving rise to the amended
allegations were discovered, and why it was not made earlier. 
Accordingly, the
Court exercising its discretion liberally in favor of amendments, GRANTS the
unopposed motion for leave to file an amended answer.  
Conclusion 

Based on the foregoing, Defendants’ motion
for leave to amend is GRANTED.
Defendants are to file their amended
answer attached as Exhibit 9 to the motion within 10 days of this order.
Defendants are ordered to give notice of this ruling.
