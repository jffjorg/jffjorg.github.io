And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the plaintiff's request for default judgment and has found several defects in the submitted package. Specifically, it appears that default has not been entered against UMIH, and the plaintiff's amended complaint in interpleader names "Mynor David Jimenez" as a defendant, but the plaintiff seeks default judgment against "Mynor Jimenez". Additionally, the plaintiff's request for court judgment does not indicate that the plaintiff seeks attorney's fees or costs, and no proposed judgment was submitted with the instant request. The court also notes that the plaintiff's amended complaint in interpleader names unrelated parties, and it does not appear that the plaintiff has dismissed these parties or applied for a separate judgment against them.

As a result, the court has denied the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment without prejudice. The court will discuss with the plaintiff a schedule for resubmission of the default judgment package, which must include a proposed form of judgment and a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment against specified parties.
