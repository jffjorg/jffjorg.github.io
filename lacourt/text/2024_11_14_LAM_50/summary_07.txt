And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made preliminary decisions about two motions filed by the defendants. The first motion sought to strike the first cause of action for breach of contract and certain paragraphs of the prayer for relief. The judge denied this motion, as the defendants did not provide sufficient argument as to why the first cause of action and identified portions of the prayer for relief arise from protected activity under the anti-SLAPP law.

The second motion was a special motion to strike, which included a request for fees and costs incurred in connection with the motion. The judge denied this request, as the defendants filed new evidence in their reply papers, which is not permitted under California law. Instead, the defendants may file a noticed motion concerning the issue of attorney's fees and costs.
