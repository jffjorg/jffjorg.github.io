[1]It is unclear to
the Court who the term “Broker” refers to. 


[2]The Court notes
that on November 8, 2024, Defendants’ counsel filed a supplemental declaration indicating,
inter alia, that “Defendants’ Reply brief and supporting papers (a
declaration and evidentiary objections) were timely served in advance of the
November 4th deadline, on November 1, 2024…Although we served the Reply papers
on November 1st, and believed we had submitted them for filing, for some
reason, we believe some clerical error, the papers were not successfully filed.”
(Suppl. Sahae Decl., ¶¶ 2, 3.) In light of the explanation set forth in Mr. Sahae’s
supplemental declaration, the Court will exercise its discretion to review
Defendants’ untimely filed reply papers.   


[3]It appears
Defendants’ counsel Ravi D. Sahae filed two declarations in support of the
motion. 


[4]The Court notes
that Defendants do not appear to provide a copy of any complaint filed in Case No.
21STCV33378 with their motion. 


[5]Defendants also
cite to Citicorp Real Estate v. Smith (9th Cir. 1998) 155 F.3d 1097, a non-binding federal case. The Smith
Court noted “[u]nder California law, a party to a contract has grounds to
rescind the contract if the consent of the party seeking rescission was
obtained through fraud. However, in order to escape from its obligation the
aggrieved party must rescind by prompt notice and offer to restore
the consideration received, if any.” (Id. at p. 1103 [internal quotations, citations,
and emphasis omitted].) Again, Plaintiffs do not appear to allege in
this action that their consent to a contract was obtained through fraud. The
Court also does not see how Smith shows that Defendants’ alleged
nondisclosures are somehow irrelevant. 
 


[6]The Court also
notes that Defendants rely on a non-binding superior court statement of
decision in connection with the reply.
