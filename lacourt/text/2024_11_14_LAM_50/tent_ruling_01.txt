[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:
 
DEFENDANT’S
  MOTION FOR ORDER REQUIRING PLAINTIFF TO FURNISH SECURITY AS A VEXATIOUS
  LITIGANT




 
Background
Plaintiffs
Nivo 1, LLC, DA BEEC-007, LLC, and Anne Kihagi (“Kihagi”) (collectively,
“Plaintiffs”) filed this action on May 6, 2021 against Defendants Lin Dee Lu
Services, Yu Sheng Victor Liu, and Xiang Liu. On April 26, 2022, Plaintiffs
filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), alleging causes of action
for (1) breach of fiduciary duty, (2) violation of Business
and Professions Code section 10240, et seq., (3) violation of Civil
Code section 2924, et seq., (4) violation of Civil
Code section 1799, et seq., (5) slander of title, (6) negligence per
se, (7) rescission (Civil Code section 1689), (8) “declaratory
relief, accounting, restitution,” and 
(9) violation of Business
and Professions Code section 17200. 
On
July 31, 2022, Plaintiffs filed an Amendment to Complaint substituting the name
“Lin Dee Liu Services”
for the incorrect name “Lin Dee Lu Services.” On December 13, 2022, Plaintiffs
filed an Amendment to Complaint naming Eric Liu in place of “Doe 2,” and an
Amendment to Complaint naming Building Future Foundation in place of “Doe 3.” 
In the FAC, Plaintiffs
allege, inter alia, that “[o]n May 7, 2018, Broker[1]
was dual agent [sic] representing a group of Lenders in arranging loan for
Borrowers.” (Compl., ¶ 11.) “The lenders were identified as: Yu Sheng Victor
Liu, a married man and Xiang Liu, a married woman (hereinafter ‘LENDER’). The
total loan amount was $1,500,000 secured by properties at 2011 Echo Park
Avenue, 5958 Carlton Way, 1237 N. Orange Grove Avenue, all located in Los
Angeles, California (‘Properties’).” (Compl., ¶ 11.) Plaintiffs allege that “[s]imilarly,
on January 9, 2018, Lin Dee Liu was dual agent [sic] representing her son Eric
Liu and their family foundation. She arranged a loan to D A. BEEC-007, LLC, a
California Limited Liability Company in which Eric Liu, a married man as to
700,000/1,000,000 interest and Building Futures Foundation, a Non-Profit California
Corporation as to 300,000/1,000,000 interest were the lenders for a total of a
$1,000,000. Plaintiffs are informed and believe that Builders Futures
Foundation is owned by Eric Liu and that Lin Dee Liu has some interest in the
entity as well.” (Compl., ¶ 12.) 
Plaintiffs allege that “Anne
Kihagi is the managing member of each of Borrowers [sic]. Anne Kihagi
contracted with Defendants for four other loans on various other properties.
Borrowers made payments against the loan secured by the Subject Properties and
the other loans as directed by Lenders and Lin Dee Liu dba LDL.” (Compl., ¶
14.) Plaintiffs allege that “Lin Dee Liu dba LDL, a licensed loan broker in the
State of California, owed a fiduciary duty of disclosure and advice to the
Plaintiffs, and violated duties of disclosure and thus engaged in a ‘deceit.’
Additionally…Defendants violated numerous mandatory statutory obligations
required of any lender or broker doing business in the State of California.
These include but are not limited to violation of Civil
Code sections 1954.5, 2076, 2295 2923, 2923.1, 2924, et seq.; and also Business and Professions Code sections 10131, 10166.01,
10176(d), 10177(n), 10177(q), 10177.6, 10230, 10237, 10240, 10241, 10242.5 and
10 CCR, Chapter 6, § 2840, et seq…” (Compl., ¶
16.) 
Defendants
Lin Dee Liu dba Lin
Dee Liu Services, Yu Sheng Victor Liu, Xiang Liu, Eric
Liu, and Building Future Foundation (collectively, “Defendants”) move for an
order deeming Kihagi a vexatious litigant and requiring her to furnish security
in the amount of $195,000. Plaintiffs oppose. 
On October 17, 2024, the
Court issued an Order continuing the hearing on the instant motion to November
13, 2024. The Court’s October 17, 2024 Order provides, inter alia, that
“[o]n or before 10/28, 2024, Plaintiffs are to file
and serve amended opposition papers that comply with the page number
requirement set forth in California Rules of Court, rule 3.1113, subdivision (d), as well as the
format requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1113, subdivision (f). Courtesy copies shall be
delivered to Dept. 50. No new evidence or new argument is to be
submitted in Plaintiffs’ amended opposition papers. On or before 11/4,
2024, Defendants may file and serve new reply papers that will supersede the previously filed reply. Courtesy copies of any
new reply papers shall be delivered to Dept. 50.” (October 17, 2024 Order at
pp. 3:18-4:3.) 
On October
28, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a new opposition to the instant motion. On November
7, 2024, Defendants filed new reply papers in support of the motion.[2]

Discussion
            Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 391.1, subdivision (a),
“[i]n any litigation pending in any court of this state, at any time until
final judgment is entered, a defendant may move the court, upon notice and
hearing, for an order requiring the plaintiff to furnish security or for an
order dismissing the litigation pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 391.3. The motion for an order requiring the
plaintiff to furnish security shall be based upon the ground, and supported by
a showing, that the plaintiff is a vexatious litigant and that there is not a
reasonable probability that they will prevail in the litigation against the
moving defendant.” 
For purposes of Code
of Civil Procedure section 391.1, “Security” means “an undertaking to
assure payment, to the party for whose benefit the undertaking is required to
be furnished, of the party’s reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees and
not limited to taxable costs, incurred in or in connection with a litigation instituted,
caused to be instituted, or maintained or caused to be maintained by a
vexatious litigant.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 391, subd. (c).)

Pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 391.2, “[a]t the hearing upon the motion the court
shall consider any evidence, written or oral, by witnesses or affidavit, as may
be material to the ground of the motion. Except for an order dismissing the
litigation pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 391.3,
no determination made by the court in determining or ruling upon the motion
shall be or be deemed to be a determination of any issue in the litigation or
of the merits thereof.” 
Pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 391.3, subdivision (a), “[e]xcept as provided in
subdivision (b), if, after hearing the evidence upon the motion, the court
determines that the plaintiff is a vexatious litigant and that there is no
reasonable probability that the plaintiff will prevail in the litigation
against the moving defendant, the court shall order the plaintiff to furnish,
for the benefit of the moving defendant, security in such amount and within
such time as the court shall fix.” Pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 391.4, “[w]hen security that has been ordered
furnished is not furnished as ordered, the litigation shall be dismissed as to
the defendant for whose benefit it was ordered furnished.” 
A.   
Whether Kihagi is a Vexatious Litigant
First, Defendants assert that Kihagi is a
vexatious litigant. Code of Civil Procedure section
391, subdivision (b) provides that “Vexatious litigant” means “a person who
does any of the following:
 
(1) In the immediately preceding seven-year
period has commenced, prosecuted, or maintained in propria persona at least
five litigations other than in a small claims court that have been (i) finally
determined adversely to the person or (ii) unjustifiably permitted to remain
pending at least two years without having been brought to trial or hearing.
 
(2) After a litigation has been finally
determined against the person, repeatedly relitigates or attempts to
relitigate, in propria persona, either (i) the validity of the determination
against the same defendant or defendants as to whom the litigation was finally
determined or (ii) the cause of action, claim, controversy, or any of the
issues of fact or law, determined or concluded by the final determination
against the same defendant or defendants as to whom the litigation was finally
determined.
 
(3) In any litigation while acting in
propria persona, repeatedly files unmeritorious motions, pleadings, or other
papers, conducts unnecessary discovery, or engages in other tactics that are
frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay.
 
(4) Has previously been declared to be a
vexatious litigant by any state or federal court of record in any action or
proceeding based upon the same or substantially similar facts, transaction, or
occurrence.
 
(5) After being restrained pursuant to a
restraining order issued after a hearing pursuant to Chapter 1 (commencing with
Section 6300) of Part 4 of Division 10 of the
Family Code, and while the restraining order is still in place, they commenced,
prosecuted, or maintained one or more litigations against a person protected by
the restraining order in this or any other court or jurisdiction that are
determined to be meritless and caused the person protected by the order to be
harassed or intimidated.”  
Defendants assert, inter
alia, that the definition of “vexatious litigant”
set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 391,
subdivision (b)(4) has been met here. In his supporting declaration[3], Defendants’ counsel
states that “in September of 2021, Anne Kihagi and NIVO-1, LLC, filed Case No.
21STCV33378 (the ‘Duane Case’) against Lin Dee Liu and lender Ami Kimoto Liu.”
(Sahae Decl., ¶ 5.) Mr. Sahae states that “[o]n December 17, 2021, I filed the
motion to deem Kihagi a vexatious litigant…On January 24, 2022, Judge Linfield
granted the motion. Attached hereto as Exhibit B is a true and correct copy of
Judge Linfield’s order deeming Kihagi a vexatious litigant.” (Sahae Decl., ¶¶
7-8.) The subject January 24, 2022 Order in Case No. 21STCV33378 provides, inter alia, that
“Defendants’ Motion for Vexatious Litigant Order Against Plaintiff Anne Kihagi
is GRANTED. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 391.7(a), Anne Kihagi is prohibited from filing any new litigation
in the courts of this state in propia persona without first obtaining leave of
the presiding judge or justice of the court where it is to be filed.” (Sahae
Decl., ¶ 8, Ex. B, pp. 14-15.)
Mr. Sahae also states that “[o]n February 4,
2022, after requesting supplemental submissions regarding the appropriate bond
amount…Judge Linfield ordered Kihagi to post a $200,000 bond.” (Sahae Decl., ¶ 9.) Mr. Sahae states that “Kihagi
failed to post the bond, so on May 11, 2022, Judge Linfield dismissed her from
the Duane Case. Kihagi filed an appeal, and she lost. On May 14, 2024, the
Court of Appeal ruled in our favor, and held that even though Kihagi’s appeal
was procedurally improper, ‘even if we were to consider the merits of
plaintiff’s appeal, we would affirm.’ Judge Linfield’s order was supported by
substantial evidence. The remittitur on this appeal has now issued. Attached
hereto as Exhibit D is a true and correct copy of the remittitur and decision
on the appeal.” (Sahae Decl., ¶ 10.) 
Defendants assert that for purposes of Code of Civil Procedure section 391, subdivision (b)(4),
“the Duane Case was based upon the same, and substantially similar, facts as
this case: namely, allegations that LDL did not make necessary disclosures, and
violated various regulations, and therefore Kihagi and her entities should
receive a windfall.” (Mot. at p. 8:3-5.) 
In the opposition, Plaintiffs argue that for
purposes of Code of Civil Procedure section 391,
subdivision (b)(4), “the Duane Case is not substantially similar to the
present case.” (See Opp’n at pp. 2:25-3:14.)   
            As set forth above,
Defendants’ counsel attaches as Exhibit B to his declaration a copy of a
January 24, 2022 Order in Case No. 21STCV33378, which Defendants refer to as
the “Duane Case.” The January 24, 2022 Order provides, inter alia, as follows: 
 
“Kihagi,
individually and as the managing and sole member of NIVO, entered into a loan
agreement with Kimoto on May 7, 2018 for $600,000.00 secured by the Duane
Property (the “Loan”). (Kihagi Decl. ¶ 5, Exh. D.) The Loan’s terms included a
12% interest, a $12,000.00 loan fee, and payments to be paid monthly for a year
with the balance due thereafter. (Kihagi Decl. Exh. D.) Liu is a licensed real
estate broker under license number 01074739 and she arranged the financing for
the Loan. (Kihagi Decl. ¶ 3, Exh. B.) Kimoto is married to Liu’s son Eric.
Kimoto is Liu’s daughter in law. The parties have a dispute whether Plaintiffs
had knowledge of this relationship when the Loan was made. (Compare Kihagi
Decl. ¶ 3 with Liu Decl. ¶ 4.) 
 
Plaintiffs never
made payments on the Loan leaving an outstanding balance of $1,073,944.36 as of
September 10, 2021. (Liu Decl. ¶ 5.) On March 15, 2021, Notice of Sale was
recorded in the office of the Los Angeles County Recorder as Document No.
20210411669. (Liu Decl. Exh. C.) 
 
On September 10,
2021, Plaintiffs filed an unverified complaint against Defendants and Does 1
through 12 for nine causes of action: (1) rescission of a void recorded deed;
(2) breach of fiduciary duty; (3) violation of Business
and Professions Code section 17200; (4) violation of Business and Professions Code section 10241.2; (5)
violation of Business and Professions Code sections
10240 et seq.; (6) violation of Civil Code
sections 1799 et seq.; (7) violation of Business
and Professions Code section 10248; (8) declaratory relief, accounting, and
restitution; and (9) fraud.” (Sahae Decl., ¶ 8, Ex. B, pp. 5-6.)[4] 
            Plaintiffs allege
similar causes of action here. As discussed above, the FAC in the instant
action alleges causes of action for, inter alia, breach of fiduciary duty, violation of Business
and Professions Code section 10240, et seq., violation of Civil
Code section 1799, et seq., rescission (Civil
Code section 1689), “declaratory relief, accounting, restitution,” and
violation of Business and Professions Code section
17200. The instant case and Case No.
21STCV33378 both involve
allegations pertaining to loan agreements.
In addition, in the Court
of Appeal decision filed on May 14, 2024 pertaining to Los Angeles County Superior
Court Case No. 21STCV33378, the Court of Appeal noted, inter alia, that “October
29, 2021, plaintiff filed an amended complaint against defendants Ami Kimoto
and Lin Dee Liu alleging breach of fiduciary duty, violations of various
disclosure laws under the Business and Professions Code, rescission, negligent
misrepresentation, and unfair competition. Plaintiff sought to rescind certain
loans that she had obtained from defendants and requested damages,
disgorgement, injunctive relief, attorney fees, and other relief.” (Sahae
Decl., ¶ 10, Ex D, p. 5.) Similarly, in the instant action filed against, inter
alia, Lin Dee Lu Services, Plaintiffs allege that “Lin Dee Liu dba LDL
breached…fiduciary duties by failing to make required disclosures, including
but not limited to (1) by failing to disclose that the loans were made in whole
or part using broker controlled funds; (2) by failing to disclose that the Lin
Dee Liu dba LDL was acting on her own behalf as a nondisclosed lender and on
behalf of her family members; (3) by concealing the name of the lenders and by
falsifying the name of the broker; (4) by failing to disclose that the broker
was also acting as a loan servicer; (5) by failing to satisfy co-signor
disclosure requirements; (6) by failing to provide all the disclosures as
required by the Business and Professional Code sections
10240 and 10241; and (7) by failing to disclose that close relatives of the
broker were the main lender.” (FAC, ¶ 71.) Plaintiffs also allege in the
instant action that “[t]he subject contract should be deemed rescinded: 1) The
absence of required disclosures vitiated mandatory statutory requirements and
rendered nugatory the agreement and/or gave rise to material contractual terms
incorporating the statutory requirements that were violated; 2) The mandatory
non-disclosure of family relation and interests of family members and lenders
spoiled the loan, 3) The invalid NODs and NOSs and foreclosure further
compounds illegality.” (FAC, ¶ 112.) 
Based on the foregoing, the
Court agrees with Defendants that the instant action and Case No. 21STCV33378 are “based upon…substantially similar facts” for
purposes of Code of Civil Procedure section 391, subdivision
(b)(4). 
 
B.     Whether There is
a Reasonable Probability that Kihagi will Prevail in the Litigation Against
Defendants 
Next, Defendants assert that “Plaintiffs’
claims lack probable validity.” (Mot. at p. 8:6.) 
First, Defendants assert that “Plaintiffs’
claims based on the foreclosure notices are meritless.” (Mot. at p. 8:10-11.)
Defendants assert that “Plaintiffs’ primary claim is an alleged discrepancy
between the amounts stated to be due in the Notice of Default and in the Notice
of Sale.” (Mot. at p. 8:12-13.) 
The Court notes that in the FAC, Plaintiffs
allege that “in early 2020, Lin Dee Liu filed several notices of default
against the properties claiming late fees from inception at a rate of 10%,
despite the fact that she had authorized the payments to be made each month and
accepted each payment that was made.” (FAC, ¶ 38.) Plaintiffs allege that “Lin
Dee Liu followed up and filed Notices of Sale (‘NOS’) on each of the properties
– 1263 North Crescent and at 1237 North Orange Grove Avenue…After the Note
Agreement (which Plaintiff maintains is invalid) matured on June 1, 2019, the
NOD did not reflect the same amounts as the NOS.” (FAC, ¶¶ 40, 41.) Plaintiffs
allege that “[t]he NOD sought ‘installment of interest only payment,’ whereas
the Notice of Sale (NOS) referenced a payment of interest and principal. The
NOS does not track the NOD, which it must. Any foreclosure sale based on an NOD
that does not seek the same amount as the NOS is a void sale.” (FAC, ¶ 42.)
Plaintiffs allege that “[t]o avoid losing the properties, Plaintiffs were
forced to sell them at significant distress levels.” (FAC, ¶ 44.)
In the motion, Defendants
argue that “Plaintiffs’ theory is meritless” because “Plaintiffs could not be ‘duressed’
into making a payment they were obligated to make.” (Mot. at p. 8:15; 8:17.) Defendants
cite to Sistrom v. Anderson (1942) 51 Cal.App.2d 213, 219,
noting that the Court of Appeal in that case found that “[i]t follows that the
buyers were obligated to take delivery of the second lot of turkeys as they had
taken delivery of the first lot, and pay for them on the basis of their grade.
That being true, the threat that they would stop payment on the first check and
would not pay for the second lot was idle and had no legal basis. They were
obligated to pay, and so would have suffered no detriment by making the payment
which the law required.” Defendants also note that “it is well settled
that it is not legal duress to threaten to or actually take advantage of
the usual remedy by suit for enforcement of a debt or obligation.” (Del Carlo v. County of Sonoma (1966) 245 Cal.App.2d 36, 40.) Defendants
assert that “Plaintiffs’ argument that the sum stated in the Notice of Default
was less than the sum stated in the Notice of Sale is a red herring. If any
amounts were overdue, Defendants were entitled to commence foreclosure
proceedings.” (Mot. at p. 9:17-19, emphasis omitted.) Plaintiffs do not appear
to respond to this point in their opposition. However, it also does not appear
that Defendants point to any evidence showing that Plaintiffs were obligated to
pay the amount stated in the alleged Notice of Sale.  
            Defendants
also assert that “Plaintiffs’ claims based on nondisclosure are meritless.”
(Mot. at p. 10:16.) Defendants argue that “the matters purportedly not
disclosed – namely, that the loans were from Lin Dee Liu or her family, and Lin
Dee Liu was representing the lenders -- were already well known to Plaintiffs.”
(Mot. at p. 10:19-22.) The Court notes that the matters purportedly not
disclosed are not solely limited to these matters. 
As set forth above,
Plaintiffs allege, inter alia, that that “Lin Dee Liu dba LDL breached…fiduciary duties by
failing to make required disclosures, including but not limited to (1) by
failing to disclose that the loans were made in whole or part using broker
controlled funds; (2) by failing to disclose that the Lin Dee Liu dba LDL was
acting on her own behalf as a nondisclosed lender and on behalf of her family members;
(3) by concealing the name of the lenders and by falsifying the name of the
broker; (4) by failing to disclose that the broker was also acting as a loan
servicer; (5) by failing to satisfy co-signor disclosure requirements; (6) by
failing to provide all the disclosures as required by the Business and
Professional Code sections 10240 and 10241; and
(7) by failing to disclose that close relatives of the broker were the main
lender.” (FAC, ¶ 71.) Plaintiffs also allege that “Defendants
failed to make the necessary disclosures and or made false representations
regarding necessary disclosures, including but not limited to the disclosures
required by Business and Professions Code sections
10131, 10166.01, 10176(d), 10177(n), 10177(q), 10177.6, 10230, 10237, 10240,
10241, 10242.5 and 10248.1.” (FAC, ¶ 77.)
Defendants submit the Declaration of Lin Dee
Liu, who states, inter alia, that “[p]ursuant to certain Loan Servicing Agreements, I (doing
business as Lin Dee Liu Services) am the duly appointed, qualified, and active
loan servicer, and authorized agent of lenders and defendants Yu Sheng Victor
Liu and Xiang Liu (collectively ‘Lenders’), who were the lenders on the subject
$1.5 million loan (the ‘Loan’) secured by properties at 2011 Echo Park Avenue (‘Echo
Park Property’), 5958 Carlton Way (‘Carlton Property’), 1237 N. Orange Grove
Avenue (‘Orange Grove Property’), all located in Los Angeles County, CA.” (Liu
Decl., ¶ 3.) Lin Dee Liu states that “I have the same position and authority
for lenders and defendants Eric Liu and Building Futures Foundation. They were
not the lenders on the Loan. They were lenders on a different loan, a
$1,000,000 loan secured by the real property at 2627 3rd St. in Santa Monica,
CA.” (Liu Decl., ¶ 4.) Lin Dee Liu further states that “[i]n late 2017, early
2018, Plaintiff Anne Kihagi came to me seeking money to post an appeal bond for
her litigation with the City and County of San Francisco. Kihagi and her
entities had done business with me for years. I had previously arranged and
directly loaned several loans to Kihagi and her LLCs. They had borrowed money
from me and my family, repeatedly.” (Liu Decl., ¶ 6.)
            Defendants argue that “Kihagi
and her entities had always borrowed family loans from Lin Dee Liu. They didn’t
care who the lenders were or who Lin Dee Liu represented. They just wanted the
money.” (Mot. at p. 11:4-6.) But Defendants do not appear to cite to any legal
authority demonstrating that Defendants are excused from making the allegedly
necessary disclosures because Kihagi had done business with Lin Dee Liu in the
past. 
            Defendants cite to Adkins v. Wyckoff (1957) 152 Cal.App.2d 684,
689, where the Court of Appeal noted that “[t]o make out a case of
actionable fraud it must appear that the alleged false representation was of a
material fact; and to be material it must be such that the contract would not
have been entered into without it.” The Court does not see how Adkins is relevant
here, as Plaintiffs do not allege a cause of action for fraud in this case. In
addition, the Court does not see how this holding is relevant to whether
Defendants are obligated to make the disclosures allegedly required here.  
Defendants also assert that “any
nondisclosures could not affect Plaintiffs’ obligations without a proper
rescission…That never happened. Plaintiffs never rescinded with an offer to
restore consideration…The alleged nondisclosures are irrelevant.” (Mot. at p.
11:7-15.) Lin Dee Liu’s supporting declaration provides, inter alia, that “Kihagi
never gave a notice of rescission for this Loan on the basis of any such
nondisclosures with an offer to restore the consideration to us for the Loan.”
(Lin Dee Liu Decl., ¶ 17.) But Defendants do not appear to cite to legal
authority demonstrating that they are purportedly exempt from providing the
allegedly required disclosures because “Kihagi never gave a notice of rescission.”
(Ibid.)
Defendants cite to Schied
v. Bodinson Mfg. Co. (1947) 79 Cal.App.2d 134, 142, where the Court of
Appeal noted that “it is well settled that when a party has been induced by
fraud to enter into a contract, he may elect either to rescind the contract by
restoring whatever he has received under it, or he may affirm the contract,
retaining whatever advantage he may have acquired, and still have his action
for damages for deceit practiced upon him in making the contract. This
rule is, however, subject to limitations…” But the Court also does not see how
the Schied case is relevant here. Plaintiffs do not appear to allege in the instant action that they were
induced by fraud to enter into any contract. And in any event, the Court does
not see how Schied demonstrates that the alleged nondisclosures
are “irrelevant.” (Mot. at p. 11:15.)[5]

Based on the foregoing, the Court does not find that Defendants have
shown that “there is not a
reasonable probability that [Kihagi] will prevail in the litigation against the
moving defendant.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 391.1, subd.
(a).)
In light of the foregoing conclusion, the Court need not consider
Defendants’ remaining arguments in the motion. The Court also notes that
Defendants raise certain arguments for the first time in the reply, for
example, that “Kihagi fails to identify any recoverable damage.” (Reply at p. 6:20-21.)
The Court notes that “¿[p]oints raised for the first time in a reply brief will
ordinarily not be considered, because such consideration would deprive the
respondent of an opportunity to counter the argument.¿” (American Drug Stores, Inc. v. Stroh (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1446, 1453¿.)
Moreover, Defendants submit evidence for the first time in connection with
their reply. (See November 7, 2024 Sahae Declaration.) The Court notes
that “¿[t]he general rule of motion practice…is that new evidence is not
permitted with reply papers.¿” (¿Jay v. Mahaffey¿(2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 1522, 1537¿.)
Thus, the Court declines to consider the arguments and evidence presented by
Defendants for the first time in their reply.[6]
Conclusion 
Based on
the foregoing, the Court denies Defendants’ motion for an order requiring
Kihagi to furnish security as a vexatious litigant. 
Defendants are ordered to provide notice of this Order.¿¿
