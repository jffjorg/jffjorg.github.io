[1]The Court notes
that it appears Defendants also seek to strike “[t]he First Cause of Action for
Breach of Contract, Paragraph 27, to the extent that it incorporates [certain]
enumerated paragraphs from the Statement of Facts…” (Notice of Mot. at p. ii:8-9.)
Defendants also move to strike paragraphs 2-5 of the “Prayer” of the Complaint.
(Notice of Mot. at p. iv:5-8.) However, Defendants’ memorandum of points and
authorities in support of the motion solely argues that “the second through
fifth causes of action arise from a protected activity.” (See Mot. at p.
7:3; 8:5-16.) Defendants’ memorandum of points and authorities does not appear
to contain any argument as to why the first cause of action or the identified portions
of the prayer for relief arise from protected activity for purposes of the
first step of the anti-SLAPP analysis. Thus, the Court denies Defendants’
motion to strike the first cause of action and paragraphs 2-5 of the “Prayer”
of the Complaint.
 


[2]The Court notes that
on November 6, 2024, Defendants filed a “reply to non-opposition” in support of
their special motion to strike. The reply provides, inter alia, that “[i]n
support of the request for fees and costs, Defendants submit proof of the fees
and costs incurred in connection with the motion with this reply. (Dale Decl.,
¶¶ 5-7, Exhs. A-C.).” (Reply at p. 3:7-8.) The Court does not find that this
request for fees in the reply is procedurally proper. The Court notes that
“¿[t]he general rule of motion practice…is that new evidence is not permitted
with reply papers.¿” (¿Jay v. Mahaffey¿(2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 1522, 1537¿.)
As set forth above, Defendants may file a noticed
motion concerning the issue of attorney’s fees and costs.
