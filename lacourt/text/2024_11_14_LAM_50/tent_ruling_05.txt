                        Plaintiff,
            vs.
MYNOR DAVID JIMENEZ, et al.,
                        Defendants.


Case No.:

Hearing Time:


10:00 a.m. 




[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:
 
PLAINTIFF’S
  REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT 




AND RELATED CROSS-ACTION


 



            
Plaintiff Raymond Ghermezian, A Professional Law Corporation (“Plaintiff”)
requests entry of default judgment against Defendants UMIH, Jonathan Frank, M.D., Avalon Surgery and Robotic Center, LLC,
Mynor Jimenez, and Advanced Imaging Center. 
The Court notes several defects with the submitted default judgment package.¿ 
First, it does not appear
that default has been entered against UMIH. 
Second, the Amended Complaint
in Interpleader names “Mynor David Jimenez” as a Defendant, but Plaintiff seeks
default judgment against “Mynor Jimenez”.
Third, Plaintiff’s counsel’s
supporting declaration indicates, inter alia, that “Plaintiff requests
$6,124.00 in attorney fees and costs for the interpleader in this action.”
(Ghermezian Decl., ¶ 15.) However, Plaintiff’s Request for Court Judgment (Form
CIV-100) does not indicate that Plaintiff seeks attorney’s fees or costs. In
addition, Item 7 of Plaintiff’s Request for Court Judgment (the Memorandum of
costs) is blank.  
Fourth, no proposed judgment appears to have been submitted with the
instant request. Pursuant to California Rules of Court,
rule 3.1800, subdivision (a)(6), “[t]he following must be included in the
documents filed with the clerk:…(6) A proposed form of judgment.”  
Lastly, Plaintiff’s Amended
Complaint in Interpleader also names, inter alia, Defendants Maxin
Moradian, M.D. and Does 1 through 100. It does not appear that Plaintiff has
dismissed these parties or applied for a separate judgment against such
parties. Pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule
3.1800, subdivision (a)(7), “[t]he following must be included in the
documents filed with the clerk:…(7) A dismissal of all parties against
whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment against
specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure
section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment.”
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment is
denied without prejudice. The Court will discuss with Plaintiff a schedule for
resubmission of the default judgment package.
