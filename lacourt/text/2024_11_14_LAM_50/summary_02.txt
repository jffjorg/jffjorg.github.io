And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is uncertain about the meaning of the term "Broker" and will review the defendants' untimely filed reply papers based on an explanation provided by their counsel. The judge notes that the defendants failed to provide a copy of the complaint in a related case and also failed to successfully file their reply papers. The defendants cited a non-binding federal case, Citicorp Real Estate v. Smith, which discusses rescission of contracts due to fraud, but the judge does not see how this case is relevant to the current dispute. The judge also notes that the defendants relied on a non-binding superior court statement of decision. Overall, the judge is seeking clarification on several issues before making a final ruling.
