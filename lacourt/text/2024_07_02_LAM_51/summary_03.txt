```

Summary:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to dismiss the action and grants the motion to quash service of summons. The court finds that the plaintiff has not met the burden of proof to demonstrate sufficient minimum contacts with California, and therefore, the court lacks personal jurisdiction over the defendant. The court also finds that the browsewrap agreement on the defendant's website is unenforceable because it is inconspicuous.
