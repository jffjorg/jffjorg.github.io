And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Tentative Ruling grants the defendants' motion for attorney's fees and costs in part. The defendants, Gregory Royston, Yuko Royston, and YGR Living Trust, are awarded $13,750.00 in attorney's fees and $1,223.12 in costs. The ruling is based on the defendants' successful motion to expunge the lis pendens from real property located at 6338 Sattes Drive, Rancho Palos Verdes, CA 90275.

The court finds that the defendants' hourly rate of $550 per hour is reasonable, but reduces the total fee award to $13,750.00 based on the fact that counsel's time reflects over 50 hours of time in connection with the motion to expunge, which appears excessive and/or unreasonable.

The court also awards the defendants $1,223.12 in costs, which appears reasonable. The ruling does not explain the calculation of the amount of attorney's fees awarded in detail, but identifies the factors considered in arriving at the amount.
