And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Judge is considering an application to continue the trial, which was originally set for January 2021. The defendant, Beverly Hills, claims that lead counsel has an arbitration conflict and a vacation conflict that will interfere with the trial date of July 22, 2024. The Judge is concerned that these conflicts were not disclosed earlier, particularly on June 20, 2023, when the trial date was set. The Judge wants to understand why the arbitration hearing was set in a way that conflicts with the trial date and why lead counsel planned a vacation that would interfere with expert discovery. If the issues can be resolved satisfactorily, the Judge may grant the application. However, the Judge notes that the trial calendar is not as open as the City assumes, and a delay or continuance could be prejudicial to the plaintiff, who has been waiting for five years.
