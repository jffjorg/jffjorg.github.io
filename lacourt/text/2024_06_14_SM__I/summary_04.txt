The judge sets forth guidelines for the meet and confer process, requiring the parties to engage in a good faith effort to resolve their differences. The judge also sets forth specific rules for responses to discovery requests, including the requirement for a privilege log and the need for a clear statement of the basis for objections. The judge emphasizes the importance of civility and professionalism in the discovery process.
