  Case Number:  19SMCV00133    Hearing Date:   June 14, 2024    Dept:  I This is an application to continue the trial.  Defendant Beverly Hills contends that its
lead counsel has an arbitration that will conflict with the July 22, 2024,
trial date and further has a vacation that will interfere with expert
discovery.  Second chair has an
unforeseen family issue that is a conflict. 
The original trial date was January 2021—that is over three years
ago.  It has been continued a number of
times since then, although not at Beverly Hills’s request.  
 
The court has a concern. 
The court is curious as to why it is that lead counsel’s arbitration
conflict and vacation conflict were not brought to this court’s attention on
June 20, 2023—a year ago—when the instant trial date was set.  If it is because those conflicts did not yet
exist, then the court would like an explanation as to why the arbitration
hearing had to be set in a way that conflicts with this trial date.  Arbitrations generally have greater
flexibility than trials, at least as to an initial setting.  The court needs to better understand why the
arbitrator insisted on creating a conflict with lead counsel.  Similarly, the court needs to better
understand why lead counsel planned a vacation for a time that would interfere
with expert discovery.
 
If both of those questions can be answered satisfactorily,
the court would be likely to grant the application, given that counsel cannot
be two places at once.  If not, then the
court will discuss the issue with the parties. 

 
The court understands that the City is not asking for a long
continuance.  But the City seems to
assume that the court’s trial calendar is wide open.  The court assures the City that the court’s
trial calendar is far from that. 
Accordingly, a delay or continuance could well be prejudicial to
plaintiff given that this case is already five years old.
