And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a medical malpractice action (Case Number 20STCV39460). The case was previously set for trial on March 11, 2024, but was continued to August 5, 2024, due to a calendar conflict. The discovery cut-off dates were not extended. The defendant recently noticed the deposition of a percipient doctor who was also designated as an expert. The deposition was set for June 20, 2024, after the discovery cut-off date. The court finds no basis for the late deposition and is inclined to enforce any agreement between the parties to allow expert discovery after the cut-off date. The court will continue the motion for a brief explaining the delay, and if there is no opposition, will grant the motion to stay the deposition pending the hearing.
