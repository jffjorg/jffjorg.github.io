And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the case between Miles and Mashian will be stayed until the court is convinced that Miles has a viable theory of the case. The judge is skeptical of Miles' theory that Mashian committed fraud by not obtaining informed consent and intends to collect the fee twice. The judge notes that the case is complex and involves multiple lawsuits and Judge Mandel's orders. The judge has stayed the instant case and has continued the discovery motion to the hearing date on Mashian's demurrer. The judge has also vacated the discovery motion hearing date and tolled the 45-day window to file a discovery motion.
