 Case Number:  23SMCV00120    Hearing Date:   June 14, 2024    Dept:  I This is a discovery motion. 
Cross-defendant Fenske moves to compel further responses against
cross-complainants.  In a late-filed
opposition, new counsel for the opposing party suggests that the papers were
not served on him even though he had told Fenske (who is self-represented) that
he represented cross-complainants and that he ought to be served, not them.  That is of concern.  
 
Of greater concern, though, is that it is not clear that
cross-complainants have complied with Code of civil procedure section 411.35,
subdivision (a), which requires that in an action for professional negligence
by a licensed architect, the cross-complainant first obtain a certificate of
merit.  The court did not see one
attached to the cross-complaint or alleged therein.  Until and unless cross-complainants produce
such a certificate—timely obtained—their cross-action cannot go forward in this
respect.  And, in fact, that was much of
the point of the discovery at issue.
 
Therefore, on the court’s own motion, the cross-complaint
against Fenske is STAYED pending the filing by cross-complainants of the
required timely-obtained certificate. 
Notwithstanding the stay, Fenske may file an appropriate motion to
dismiss the action on this basis.  Of
course, if cross-complainants submit the certificate, the stay will be lifted
without further order.  Similarly, cross-complainants
may move to lift the stay if they believe that they have a legal basis to do
so.
 
This stay does not affect any other aspect of the case.
