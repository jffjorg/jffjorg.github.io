Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to vacate the dismissal of the breach of contract action. The Judge has denied the motion, finding that the plaintiffs' claim of mistake or excusable neglect is not supported by the evidence. The Judge also found that the plaintiffs' failure to understand the legal import of the dismissal is not a valid ground for relief. The Judge notes that the plaintiffs' claim of extrinsic fraud is also not supported, as they were aware of the dismissal and had the opportunity to participate in the proceeding. The Judge concludes that the dismissal was proper and that the plaintiffs' claims are without merit.
