Summary:
The Judge's Tentative Ruling denies Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (MSJ) and Alternative Motion for Summary Adjudication (MSA) on several grounds. The Judge finds that Defendant failed to consider the COVID-19 tolling of the statute of limitations (SOL) and that Plaintiff failed to present expert opinion and facts/evidence to show the falsity of Defendant's representations related to her treatment. The Judge also grants Defendant's Motion to Stay pending Federal Action, staying the instant action in its entirety and tolling the 5-year time limitation to try the case pending resolution of the Federal case.
