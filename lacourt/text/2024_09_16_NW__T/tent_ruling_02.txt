 Case Number:  22VECV01190    Hearing Date:   September 16, 2024    Dept:  T 22VECV01190 FORRESTER V  RESHAD There are two tentative  orders. 1. [TENTATIVE] ORDER:  Defendant Mohamad Reshad, D.D.S.'s Motion for  Summary Judgment and the Alternative Motion for Summary Adjudication  are DENIED. Introduction  Defendant Mohamad Reshad, D.D.S.  (Defendant) moved for summary judgment (MSJ) against Plaintiff Christine  Forrester, D.D.S.'s (Plaintiff) Second Amended Complaint (SAC).  In the alternative, Defendant moved for summary  adjudication (MSA) against the first cause of action (COA) for professional  negligence, the second COA for negligent misrepresentation, the third COA for  intentional misrepresentation, and the fourth COA for concealment fraud. Defendant's reply was due on  September 11, 2024 but none was filed. Discussion Defendant argued that there is no  triable issue of material fact as to the statute of limitations (SOL)  affirmative defense relative to each of the four COAs.  (Code Civ. Proc., secs. 340.5 [three year for  health care provider negligence] and 338(d) [three years for fraud].)  Defendant, as the moving party on the MSJ,  has the initial burden of production of admissible evidence.  The only argument presented in the MSJ  related to the SOL defense is that the SOL for the professional negligence COA  accrued on May 15, 2019.  (Defendant's  Separate Statement of Fact (DSSF) 62.)   The instant action was filed on August 18, 2022 and Defendant asserted  that the instant action is in violation of the maximum three year time period  by 95 days.  However, Defendant's  argument failed to take into consideration that the SOL was tolled or  temporarily suspended due to the world-wide COVID pandemic.  The California's Governor issued Executive  Order N-38-20 on March 27, 2020, and the Judicial Council issued Emergency Rule  9, effective April 6, 2020 and amended it on May 22, 2020.  Emergency Rule 9(a), relevant to SOLs over  180 days, tolled the SOL time-period from April 6, 2020, until October 1, 2020;  a period of 178 days.  (Cal. Rules of  Court, Appendix I.)  Because of the 178  day COVID-19 tolling period, the three-year SOL applicable to the instant  action was extended by 178 days.  Because  Plaintiff filed the instant action within the 178 days of the tolling period,  the instant action does not appear to be in violation of the three-year  SOL.  Defendant's SOL argument's failure  to consider the COVID-19 tolling of the SOL makes the argument  unpersuasive.  Defendant failed to meet  his initial burden on the MSJ as to the SOL affirmative defense against the  professional negligence COA.     For the purposes of the instant  MSJ/MSA only, the Court presumed that May 15, 2019 was the accrual date for the  professional negligence SOL.  The Court  makes no finding of fact that May 15, 2019 is the actual accrual date for the  professional negligence SOL.   The Court, on its own motion,  takes judicial notice of Circulating Order to the Judicial Council Number  CO-20-09, dated May 22, 2020, as an official act taken in response to the  pandemic. (Evid. Code, secs. 459 and 452(c).) Specifically as to the SOL  argument against the three fraud-based COAs, the Court noted that Defendant's  Points and Authorities failed to present any argument to support his contention  that the three fraud-based COAs are barred by their relevant SOL.  Defendant's MSJ merely cited the relevant  statute.  (Defendant's P&As pg.  28:5-6; 29:6-7 and 24-25.)  Defendant  failed to apply the legal authority to any facts.   A judge in a civil case is not  "'obligated to seek out theories [a party] might have advanced, or to  articulate for him that which … [a party] has left unspoken.'" (Mesecher  v. County of San Diego (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 1677, 1686.)  Without any argument or any application of  the SOL to any facts, the argument is unpersuasive.  Defendant failed to meet his initial burden  on the SOL argument.  Even if it is  presumed that Defendant is asserting that the three-year SOL for the fraud-based  claims accrued on May 15, 2019, the argument would still be unpersuasive due to  the COVID-19 tolling of SOLs. Because Defendant failed to meet  his initial burden on the MSJ as to the SOL affirmative defense, the burden did  not shift to Plaintiff to show a triable issue of fact exists. The MSJ based upon the SOL  affirmative defense is DENIED.   Defendant further argued that  there is no triable issue of fact as to prima facie case for professional  negligence COA and the fraud-based COAs.   Defendant argued that Plaintiff cannot establish breach, causation, or  damages as to professional negligence.   Defendant submitted expert witness testimony of Douglas Galen, D.D.S. to  provide facts to support the contention that Defendant met the standard of care  and did not cause Plaintiff's injuries.   (DSSF 43-61.)  Based upon Dr.  Galen's testimony, Defendant met his initial burden of production to show that  there is no triable issue of fact as to breach and causation.  The burden shifted to Plaintiff.  Plaintiff attested to being a dentist but  Plaintiff's declaration failed to present testimony showing that Defendant's  treatment breached or fell below the standard of care or caused Plaintiff's  injuries.  Plaintiff's declaration  provided an accounting of the treatment Defendant provided, a summary of the  communications with Defendant's office, and the failures in Defendant's  production of evidence.  However,  Plaintiff did not provide an opinion as to Defendant's treatment or the  causation of her injuries.  Plaintiff  failed to meet the burden of production.   Because Plaintiff did not submit expert opinion to show that Defendant's  treatment fell below the standard of care and Defendant's treatment caused  Plaintiff's injuries, there is no triable issue of fact as to the professional  negligence COA. Defendant then argued that  Plaintiff cannot establish untruthfulness, knowledge of the falsity or lack of  a reasonable ground for believing the representation to be true, intent to  induce reliance, lack of knowledge of falsity, damages as to the fraud-based  COAs.  The alleged misrepresentations  were made on April 12, 2018 regarding Plaintiff's treatment and the concealment  fraud occurred between May 15, 2019 and March 22, 2022. (SAC pars. 39-42, and  55.)  Defendant presented evidence to  dispute that the alleged misrepresentations were untruthful.  (DSSF 63-76.)   With these facts, Defendant met his initial burden of production and the  burden shifted to Plaintiff.  To dispute  Defendant's facts, Plaintiff presented her own declaration attesting to the  treatment provided by Defendant.   (Plaintiff Decl. pars. 14-30.)   However, Plaintiff's declaration failed to testify as to the falsity of  Defendant's statements and Defendant's concealment related to the  implants.  Plaintiff's testimony only provided  that the representations were made but failed to attest to the representations'  falsity.  Plaintiff failed to meet her  burden of production regarding the falsity of any of Defendant's  representations related to her treatment.   Because Plaintiff did not submit facts/evidence to show the falsity of  Defendant's treatment or representations related to the treatment Plaintiff  received, there is no triable issue of fact as to the fraud-based COAs  regarding representations related to Plaintiff's treatment. Plaintiff further alleged that  Defendant misrepresented his name as being Mamaly Reshad when Defendant's  actual name was Mohamad Ali Reshad.   Defendant provided that "Mamaly" is a nickname or phonetic  contraction of Mohamad and Ali.  (DSSF  74.)  However, there is no admissible  evidence presented to support Defendant's contention that "Mamaly" is  a nickname or a phonetic contraction.   Defendant's declaration is silent as to these alleged facts.  Because Defendant's contention is  unsupported, Defendant failed to meet his initial burden of production on the  alleged fraud related to Defendant's name.  (SAC par. 48.)   Because Defendant did not meet his burden, the burden did not shift to  Plaintiff.  Because Defendant failed to  show that there is no triable issue of fact as to third COA, Defendant failed  to show that he is entitled to entry of judgment as to the entire action.  On this defect, there is grounds to deny the  MSJ. Plaintiff further alleged that  Defendant misrepresented his accreditation as a "Doctor of Dental  Surgery."  (SAC par. 49.)  Defendant's evidence, in fact, supports Plaintiff's  allegation because Defendant only attested to obtaining a "Bachelor of  Dental Surgery" and two "Bachelor's Degree of Master of Science with  Distinction"  (Defendant Decl. pars.  4, 6, and 7.)  Defendant failed to  present any evidence or facts to show that the allegation is untruthful or that  Defendant's representation of obtaining a Doctor of Dental Surgery degree was  in fact true.  Because Defendant failed  to present facts regarding his dental degree, Defendant failed to meet his  initial burden on the MSJ as to the third COA.   Because Defendant failed to show that there is no triable issue of fact  as to third COA, Defendant failed to show that he is entitled to entry of  judgment as to the entire action.  On  this defect, there is grounds to deny the MSJ. Defendant's MSJ is DENIED.   As to the MSA, Defendant's Notice  to the MSA requested adjudication of a total of 27 issues.  The issues included:  Nine issues related to the first  COA for professional negligence (i.e., SOL; affirmative defenses of comparative  negligence, apportionment of fault, assumption of the risk, failure to  mitigate, lack of foreseeability; and lack of evidence as to the prima facie  elements of breach, causation, and damages),  Six issues related to the second  COA for negligent misrepresentation (i.e., SOL; and lack of evidence as to the  prima facie elements of untruthfulness, knowledge of the falsity or lack of a  reasonable ground for believing the representation to be true, intent to induce  reliance, lack of knowledge of falsity, damages),  Six issues related to the third  COA for intentional misrepresentation (i.e., SOL; and lack of evidence as to  the prima facie elements of untruthfulness, knowledge of the falsity or lack of  a reasonable ground for believing the representation to be true, intent to  induce reliance, lack of knowledge of falsity, damages), and  Six issues related to the fourth  COA for concealment fraud (i.e., SOL; and lack of evidence as to the prima  facie elements of untruthfulness, knowledge of the falsity or lack of a  reasonable ground for believing the representation to be true, intent to induce  reliance, lack of knowledge of falsity, damages).  (See Notice to the MSA, pg. 2:10-5:18.)   "If summary adjudication is  sought, whether separately or as an alternative to the motion for summary  judgment, the specific cause of action, affirmative defense, claims for  damages, or issues of duty must be stated specifically in the notice of motion  and be repeated, verbatim, in the separate statement of undisputed material  facts."  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule  3.1350.)  Defendant's Separate Statement  failed to specifically repeat, verbatim, the 27 issues being adjudicated.  For this defect, the MSA as to all 27 issues  is improperly made. Ruling on Objections by plaintiff to evidence submitted by defendant.  Plaintiff’s objections are found embedded in her opposition at pages 51-53 of the PDF.  They do not comply with Rule 3.1354 as follows:
Objections were not served and filed separately The form of the objections is improper.  The objections are stated generally without identifying the title, page, and line number that is objected to.  They do not quote the objectionable material.
For these reasons, the objections are overruled.
California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1354 sets forth the rules for written objections to evidence in an MSJ.
“(a) Time for filing and service of objections
