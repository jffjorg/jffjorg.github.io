And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment, ruling that the plaintiff's claim is barred by the statute of limitations. The plaintiff was injured during a medical procedure in 2018 and filed a complaint in 2020, more than one year after he was on inquiry notice of the cause of his injury. The defendant argued that the plaintiff did not possess evidence to prove that the defendant was negligent and that the statute of limitations had expired. The judge agreed, finding that the undisputed facts establish that the action commenced more than one year after the plaintiff was on inquiry notice of the cause of his injury.
