And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to continue trial, which was filed by the defendants (American States Water Company and Golden State Water Company) on August 9, 2023. The motion was filed to advance the hearing on the Motion for Summary Judgment (MSJ) or to continue trial, which is currently scheduled for April 9, 2024. The Judge finds good cause to continue trial because the first available date for a hearing on the MSJ was November 4, 2024, and the defendants would be prejudiced if they do not have an opportunity to have their MSJ heard before trial. The Judge also notes that no opposition has been filed by other parties, and that the defendants would be prejudiced if the motion is not granted. As a result, the trial is continued to a date on or after December 4, 2024, and all deadlines are reset.
