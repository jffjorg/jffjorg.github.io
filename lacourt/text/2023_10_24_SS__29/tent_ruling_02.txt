 Case Number:  21STCV15899    Hearing Date:   October 24, 2023    Dept:  29  

TENTATIVE 
 
Defendant’s
motion to compel is GRANTED.
 
Defendant’s request for sanctions is GRANTED in part.
 
Background 
 
On April
27, 2021, Plaintiff Melissa Cantarero (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against
Defendants Truman Shackelford, Tau Omega Rho Fraternity, and Does 1 through 100
for sexual battery, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and
negligence.  
 
On May 25,
2023, Defendant Truman Shackelford (“Defendant”) filed his Answer.  On that same day, Defendant served Plaintiff
with discovery, including Requests for Production (Set One).  (Andrews Decl., ¶ 2 & Exh. A.)  Plaintiff never served responses to this
discovery request.  (Id., ¶ 5.)
 
On August
31, 2023, Defendant filed the instant motion to compel Plaintiff to respond to
the discovery.  Defendant also requests
sanctions. 
 
Plaintiff
has not filed an opposition to the motion. 
 
The Court
is aware that two other discovery motions in this matter were previously heard this
month.
 
Legal Standard 
 
A party must respond to requests for production of
documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents are directed
does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) There
is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and
confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
requests for production, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(c).)
In
Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010,
subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include
“[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd. (a).)
“The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act
in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no
opposition to the motion was filed ….” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1348(a).)  
Discussion
On May 25,
2023, Defendant propounded Requests for Production (Set One) on Plaintiff.  (Andrews Decl., ¶ 2 & Exh. A.)  Plaintiff never served responses.  (Id., ¶ 5.)
 
Defendant need
show nothing more.  The motion to compel
is GRANTED.
Defendant’s
request for sanctions is also GRANTED.  Given
the relatively straightforward nature of a motion to compel initial responses,
and the economies of scale associated with preparing multiple parallel motions,
the Court awards sanctions on this motion in the amount of $697.50, calculated
as 1.5 hours of attorney work, multiplied by counsel’s reasonable billing rate
of $425 per hour, plus the $60 filing fee. 
(See id., ¶¶ 6-7.)  
Conclusion
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS
Defendant’s motion to compel.
Plaintiff is ORDERED to
provide verified, code-compliant, written responses, without objections, to
Defendant’s Requests for Production (Set
One) within 30 days of notice of this order.
Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED in
part. Plaintiff and counsel of record Everardo Vargas Valencia are ORDERED,
jointly and severally, to pay monetary sanctions to Defendant in the amount of
$697.50 within 30 days of notice of this order. 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
