And here is the English text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in favor of the Defendant's motion to compel the Plaintiff to respond to discovery requests. The Plaintiff failed to serve responses to the Defendant's Form Interrogatories (Set One) despite being served on February 16, 2023. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff did not file an opposition to the motion, and therefore, the Defendant need show nothing more to demonstrate a failure to respond. The Judge grants the motion to compel and orders the Plaintiff to provide verified, code-compliant, written responses to the discovery requests within 21 days. Additionally, the Judge grants the Defendant's request for sanctions in the amount of $525, to be paid by the Plaintiff and their counsel, K & L Associates.
