The defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff to respond to discovery requests is granted. The plaintiff failed to respond to the discovery requests, which is a violation of the discovery rules. The court awards sanctions to the defendant in the amount of $697.50, which is calculated as 1.5 hours of attorney work multiplied by the reasonable billing rate of $425 per hour, plus the $60 filing fee. The plaintiff is ordered to provide verified, code-compliant, written responses to the discovery requests without objections within 30 days of notice of this order. The defendant's request for monetary sanctions is also granted in part, and the plaintiff and their counsel are ordered to pay the sanctions within 30 days of notice of this order.
