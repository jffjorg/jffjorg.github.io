Summary:

The Judge denies the motions to compel further responses to discovery, citing two procedural reasons: the motions are untimely, as they were filed months ago and are set for hearing twelve days before trial, and there has been no Informal Discovery Conference. The Judge notes that the Defendant could have sought an earlier hearing date but failed to do so. The Judge also reminds the parties of the importance of following the procedures outlined in the California Code of Civil Procedure and the Civil Discovery Act.
