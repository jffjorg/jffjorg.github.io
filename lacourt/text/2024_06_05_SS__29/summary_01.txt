And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the case. The plaintiff, Alden Monterroso, had filed a complaint against Jorge Mendoza, Erika Orellana, and Does 1 through 100, alleging a motor vehicle accident at or near the intersection of Rodeo Road and Crenshaw Boulevard. The plaintiff had failed to appear at trial and had been dismissed without prejudice. The plaintiff had filed three motions to set aside the dismissal, but had failed to appear at hearings and had not provided opposition. The judge ruled that the plaintiff's failure to appear at trial and hearing, and the delay in seeking relief, constituted a lack of diligence and a satisfactory excuse for the relief sought. The judge also ruled that the plaintiff's motion did not meet the statutory requirements for relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473.
