  Case Number:  19STCV37402    Hearing Date:   June 5, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Set Aside Dismissal filed by Plaintiff Alden
Monterroso.
 
Tentative
The motion is denied.
Background
On October 17,
2019, Alden Monterroso (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Jorge Mendoza, Erika
Orellana, and Does 1 through 100, asserting one cause of action for general
negligence arising out of a motor vehicle accident at or near the intersection
of Rodeo Road and Crenshaw Boulevard. 
The complaint identifies the date of the accident as October 18, 2019,
which appears to be a typographical error, as it is one day after the date the
complaint was filed. 
 
No defendant has
appeared.  No proof of service has been
filed.
 
Plaintiff did
not appear at the Final Status Conference on April 1, 2021.
 
Plaintiff did
not appear at trial on April 15, 2021. 
Based upon Plaintiff’s failure to appear at trial, the Court dismissed
the entire action without prejudice.
 
On April 14,
2022, Plaintiff filed a motion to set aside the dismissal.  The motion was placed off calendar when
Plaintiff failed to appear at the hearing on June 29, 2022.
 
On March 20,
2023, Plaintiff filed a second motion to set aside the dismissal.  The motion was placed off calendar when
Plaintiff failed to appear at the hearing on June 2, 2023.
 
On June 13,
2023, Plaintiff filed this third motion to set aside the dismissal. No
opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
Code of Civil Procedure section 473,
subdivision (b), provides for mandatory and discretionary relief from dismissal.
“The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her
legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding
taken against him through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) Where such an
application for discretionary relief is made, the motion shall be accompanied
by a copy of the answer or pleading proposed to be filed, or the application
will not be granted. (Id.) The court must grant relief from dismissal
where the application is accompanied by an attorney affidavit attesting to his
or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. (Id.) In either
case, the application must be made within a reasonable time, and in no case
exceeding six months after the judgment. (Id.)
In addition, and separately, even when there
is no statutory basis to set aside a default or dismissal, courts have “the
inherent authority to vacate a default and default judgment on equitable
grounds such as extrinsic fraud or extrinsic mistake.”  (Bae v. T.D. Service Co. (2016) 245
Cal.App.4th 89, 97; see also, e.g., Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8
Cal.4th 975, 981-982.)
“Extrinsic fraud” generally involves some act
that kept the party seeking relief “in ignorance of the action or proceeding”
or “fraudulently prevented” the party “from presenting his claim or
defense.”  (Kulchar v. Kulchar
(1969) 1 Cal.3d 467, 471; see also, e.g., Bae, supra, 245 Cal.App.4th at
p. 97.)  
“Extrinsic mistake” is defined broadly and encompasses “almost any set of extrinsic circumstances
which deprive a party of a fair adversary hearing.”  (In re Marriage of Park (1980) 27
Cal.3d 337, 342; see also, e.g., Rappleyea,
supra, 8 Cal.4th at p, 981.)  There need not
necessarily be a mistake “in the strict sense.” 
(Park, supra, 27 Cal.3d at p. 342.)  But a mistake
is intrinsic, and not extrinsic, when “a party’s own negligence allows the …
mistake to occur.”  (Kramer v.
Traditional Escrow (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 13, 29.)  Intrinsic mistakes relate to the merits of
the case, such that granting relief would improperly allow a party to
relitigate the case.  (Kulchar, supra,
1 Cal. 3d at pp. 472-73.)  Examples of
intrinsic mistakes, or intrinsic fraud, are perjury, failing to complete
discovery, or failing to prepare adequately for trial.  (Ibid.)
Courts apply a stringent,
three-part test for equitable relief pursuant to the inherent authority of the
court.  A party seeking relief on
equitable grounds must show (1) “a satisfactory excuse”; (2) “a meritorious
case”; and (3) "diligence in seeking” relief.  (Rappleyea, supra, 8 Cal.4th at p.
982; see also, e.g., Kramer, supra, 56 Cal.App.5th at p. 29; 1 Weil
& Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The
Rutter Group 2023), ¶ 5:435.)
Discussion
Plaintiff requests the Court set aside the order
dismissing the action (dated April 15, 2021) based on the illness of the former
counsel handling the case.  (Prussak
Decl., ¶¶ 5-7.)
 
Relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473 must be
requested within six months. Here, the motion was filed more than two years
after the dismissal. Accordingly, relief is not available under section 473.
 
Beyond six months, the only relief that is available is equitable
relief pursuant to the inherent authority of the Court.  But Plaintiff has not made the showing
required for equitable relief under the case law.  Among other things, Plaintiff has not shown
diligence in seeking relief; according to counsel’s declaration – which was
signed in February 2022 – new counsel was aware of the inability of former
counsel to handle this case by late 2021 or early 2022.  Why Plaintiff then missed two hearings on the
prior motions seeking relief from default (in June 2022 and June 2023) and then
filed this motion in June 2023 is not explained.
 
Plaintiff has not made a sufficient showing for an order
granting relief pursuant to its inherent authority.
 
Accordingly, the motion is denied.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s motion
to set aside dismissal.
 
Moving party to give notice.
