And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted Yolanda's unopposed motion for an order to release phone records from Verizon. The motion is granted because no consent can be obtained from Francisco, who is deceased. The records are relevant to the case because they were made shortly before and around the time Francisco transferred his house to Franky. The court finds that Yolanda has sufficiently complied with the rules of court and that the subpoena for the records is valid.
