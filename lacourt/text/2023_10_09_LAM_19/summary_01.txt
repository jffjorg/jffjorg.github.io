And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has continued the hearing on the motions for preliminary injunction by plaintiff Vicente Del Rio and defendant Tres A, LLC to October 30, 2023. The judge has also continued the status conference to the same date. The judge has expressed disappointment that courtesy printed copies of all briefing have not been received, and requires that these copies be delivered by October 23, 2023. Additionally, the judge has taken issue with the plaintiff's lodging of documents under seal without permission, and has set a motion to seal lodged evidence for October 30, 2023. The judge has given the plaintiff an opportunity to correct this issue by filing the records under seal with the required showing, or refiling the records in unredacted/unsealed form, or withdrawing the redacted/sealed material by October 16, 2023.
