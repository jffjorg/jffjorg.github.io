Legal Standard
 
Standard for Judicial Relief from Bar to Sue
Because of Nonpresentation of Claim– Cal. Gov. Code § 946.6 provides that “[i]f
an application for leave to present a claim is denied or deemed to be denied
pursuant to Section 911.6, a petition may be made to the court for an order
relieving the petitioner from Section 945.4 [requiring a claim to be presented
to a public entity before an action may be brought against the public entity].”
(Cal. Gov. Code § 946.6(a).) The petition must be filed within six months after
the application to the board is denied. (Cal. Gov. Code § 946.6(b).) The court
shall relieve the petitioner from the requirements of Section 945.4 if the
court finds (1) the application to the board was made within a reasonable time
not to exceed that specified in Section 911.4(b); (2) was denied or deemed
denied pursuant to Section 911.6; and (3) that one or more of the enumerated
reasons applies. (Cal. Gov. Code § 946.6(c).) The enumerated reasons include
(1) the failure to present the claim was through mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or excusable neglect unless the public entity establishes that it
would be prejudiced in the defense of the claim if relief is granted; (2) the
person who sustained the alleged injury or loss was a minor during the time the
claim was to be presented; (3) the person who sustained the alleged injury or
loss was physically or mentally incapacitated during the time the claim was to
be presented; and (4) the person who sustained the alleged injury or loss died
before the expiration of the time to present the claim. (Ibid.) Where no
testimonial evidence is offered with respect to a delay in filing a claim against
a county, the court may decide whether to grant relief on the basis of the
petition and declarations offered in support of, or in opposition to, the
petition. (Cal. Gov. Code § 946.6(e).) 
 
Cal. Gov. Code § 911.4(b)
provides that an application to the board to present a late claim must be made
within one year after the accrual of the cause of action.

Discussion
 
Application – As a
preliminary matter, the Court notes that there may be an issue with notice.
Plaintiff’s notice states, in relevant part: “Petitioner Beverly D. Owens by
& through their Attorney Vincent J. Quigg, Esq. hereby by Petition this
Court for Order Granting Leave to pursue a Late Government Claim for Beverly D.
Owens, Alternatively Plaintiffs Attorney seeks for Leave to File a Late Claim
Pursuant to C.C.P. § 473(b).” (Petition 1:22-25 [emphasis in original].)
The Memorandum and Points of Authorities includes an argument related to Cal.
Gov. Code § 946.6(b), which was not disclosed in the Notice as a ground upon
which the motion would be made. (See Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §1010.) 
 
However, Palmdale has waived any
objection to defects in notice as it has filed an Opposition on the merits. (See
Tate v. Superior Court (1975) 45 Cal. App. 3d 925, 930; Alliance Bank
v. Murray (1984) 161 Cal. App. 3d 1, 7; Eliceche v. Federal Land Bank
Assn. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 1349, 1375; Reedy v. Bussell (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 1272, 1288-89.)
 
Plaintiff presents a timeline
that includes the following: (1) the alleged incident occurred on September 11,
2021; (2) on October 05, 2021, the Law Office of Vincent J. Quigg was hired to
represent counsel; (3) from October 18, 2021 to August 01, 2023, Plaintiff
attempted to informally resolve the claim with Broadspire, presented to be the
insurance entity for this accident; (4) on August 01, 2023, Plaintiff filed her
Complaint; (5) on July 28, 2023, Vincent J. Quigg (“Quigg”), submitted an
Application for Relief to File a Late Claim by U.S. Post Express Mail; (6) on
August 24, 2023 Palmdale denied to Application for Relief to File a Late Claim
by U.S. Post Express Mail; and (7) on February 14, 2024, Plaintiff filed this
motion. This presentation is supported by Quigg’s attached declaration. 
 
Cal. Gov. Code § 911.4(b)
provides that an application to the board to present a late claim must be made
within one year after the accrual of the cause of action.  One year
from September 11, 2021 is September 11, 2022. Plaintiff has presented that she
did not present the Application for Relief to File a Late Claim by September 11, 2022. Rather,
she presented the claim on July 28, 2023. (Decl. Quigg ¶ 9.) July 28, 2023 is approximately
10 months from September 11, 2022. 
 
Plaintiff
only moves under Cal. Gov. Code § 946.6(b).[1]
Cal. Gov. Code § 946.6(b) which  provides
that a petition shall show that application was made to the board under Section
911.4 and was denied or deemed denied, the reason for failure to present the
claim within the time limit specified in Section 911.2, the information
required by Section 910, and the petition shall be filed within six months
after the application to the board is denied or deemed to be denied pursuant to
Section 911.6. Relief by the Court, however, is conditioned upon the
requirements set out in 946.6(c). The Court cannot provide relief as Cal. Gov. Code § 946.6(c) states that
the application to the board was made within a reasonable time not to exceed
that specified in Cal. Gov. Code 911.4(b), Cal. Gov. Code § 911.4(b) provides
that an application to the board to present a late claim must be made within
one year after the accrual of the cause of action, and, as described ante,
the Application for Relief to File a Late Claim exceeds that specified
in Cal. Gov. Code § 911.4(b). The California Supreme Court reiterates the
importance of the statutory timeline in Draper v. City of L.A. (1990) 52
Cal.3d 502, 504 [reiteration of statutory timeline prior to discussion of Cal.
Gov. Code § 946.6(c)(3)].) Further, Plaintiff has not addressed any subdivision
of Cal. Gov. Code § 946.6(c). Rather, Plaintiff presents mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or excusable neglect under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 473 as a separate
argument. 
 
Cal. Code
Civ. Proc. § 473(b) does not provide for relief for failing to meet the
statutory deadline set out in Cal. Gov. Code §§ 946.6 as such an action does
not constitute a “judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against”
Plaintiff as contemplated by the statute. 
 
The Court
notes, should the moving papers be read liberally so that Plaintiff’s mistake inadvertence,
surprise, or excusable neglect argument was applied to Cal. Gov. Code § 946.6(c)(1),
the statutory time limit prevents a bar to Plaintiff’s relief. 
 
Accordingly, the Petition for
Relief to File a Late Claim is DENIED.

Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Beverly D. Owens’ Petition for Relief to
File a Late Claim for Beverly D. Owens is DENIED.
