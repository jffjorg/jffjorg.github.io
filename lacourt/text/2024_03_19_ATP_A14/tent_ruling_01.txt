  Case Number:  19AVCV00259    Hearing Date:   March 19, 2024    Dept:  A14 Background
 
This is an action based in fraud.
Plaintiff Soroush Janamian (“Plaintiff”) alleges that, commencing April 2013,
Defendants Raman Refaei (“Raman”)[1], Hamid
Refai (“Refai”), and R & A, LLC (“R&A” and, collectively, “Defendants”)
(1) rented real property to Plaintiff located at 2711 E. Avenue I, Lancaster,
CA 93535 (“Property No. 1”); (2) a property management agreement for 2703 E.
Avenue I, Lancaster, CA 93535 (“Property No. 2” and, collectively, the
“Properties”); and (3) a property management agreement for 2707 E. Avenue I,
Lancaster, CA 93535 (“Property No. 3”). The residential agreement was set at
the rate of $300.00 per month. Plaintiff presents: 
 

He had
     accepted the rental agreement and, beginning April 2013, had occupied the
     apartment on the second floor of Property No. 1, and paid a total of
     $11,400.00 ($300.00/month) in rent for the period of April 2013 through
     May 2016. 
He
     entered into a two-year commercial lease agreement with Defendants to rent
     a mechanic shop located on the ground floor of Property No. 1 on June 01,
     2016 for a security deposit of $2,000.00 and three-months’ rent, totaling
     $4,800.00. Plaintiff also alleges $7,000.00 was used for miscellaneous
     start up expenses to establish the mechanic shop. 
He was
     employed by Defendants to manage Properties Nos. 2 and 3 and would be paid
     $800.00 per month for his services and that Plaintiff would be paid when
     Defendants sold the Properties.

 
Plaintiff further alleges that,
in July 2016, an inspector from the City of Lancaster informed him (1) that
there was no certificate of occupancy for the apartment, the apartment was
illegal, the apartment lacked proper permits, and the apartment was not
habitable, and (2) Property No. 1 was not zoned for a mechanic shop, had no
on-site parking for automobiles, and had not been zoned commercial for 13
years. Regarding the management agreement, Plaintiff presents that Defendants
knew the representations were false and have not sold the Properties. Plaintiff
contends that he has suffered damages in the amount of $30,400.00. 
 
On April 02, 2019, Plaintiff
filed his Complaint alleging one cause of action for Fraud and Deceit.
 
On September 10, 2019, Raman
filed his Answer.
 
On September 17, 2019, Hamid and
R&A, LLC filed its Answer.  
 
On January 24, 2020, Plaintiff
retained counsel and filed his Substitution of Attorney on January 27, 2020. 
 
Defendants former counsel was
relieved on December 05, 2019 for R&A, LLC; January 07, 2020 for Hamid
Refai, and substituted on March 04, 2022 for Raman. 
 
On June 24, 2022, Raman filed a
Substitution of Attorney, retaining Andrew Davis (“Davis”) as counsel. 
 
On June 24, 2022, Raman filed his
Motion for Sanctions Against Plaintiff and his Attorney Bruce T. McIntosh
(“McIntosh”) (“Motion for Sanctions”).
 
On June 28, 2022, Raman filed his
Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings (“MJOP”). 
 
No Oppositions were filed to
either motion.
 
On August 11, 2022, the Court
held a hearing on the matter. The Court granted the MJOP and denied the Motion
for Sanctions. Plaintiff was given 30 days’ leave to amend the Complaint. 
 
On September 16, 2022, Plaintiff
filed his First Amended Complaint (“FAC”).
 
On December 15, 2022, Raman filed
two motions, (1) Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, and (2) Motion for
Sanctions, set for hearing on January 10, 2023.
 
On January 06, 2023, two court
days before the hearing, Plaintiff filed his Oppositions. The Court, in its
discretion, did not consider the untimely Opposition as doing so would deprive
Raman a chance to reply and indicated such in its Order and Statement of
Decision. (See Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1300(d).) 
 
On January 10, 2023, a hearing on
the motions was held. McIntosh and Davis presented oral argument for their
respective clients. The Court took the matter under submission. 
 
On January 13, 2023, the Court
issued its ruling on the submitted matter. The Court determined the Motion for
Judgment on the pleadings moot as the FAC was untimely filed. That is, the FAC
was filed after the time allowed by the Court’s August 11, 2022 Order. The FAC
was stricken pursuant to Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 438(h)(4)(A). The Court imposed
Sanctions of $999.99.
 
On April 04, 2023, the Court clarified
that the sanctions imposed were to be against Plaintiff and McIntosh jointly
and severally. The Court ordered the sanctions to be paid no later than April
15, 2023. 
 
On May 01, 2023, the Court
dismissed the Complaint filed by Plaintiff on April 02, 2019 with prejudice.
 
On November 07, 2023, Plaintiff
filed this Motion for an Order Setting Aside Dismissal of Case and Reinstating
Case to Civil Active List (“Motion to Set Aside”). 
 
On January 16, 2024, the Court
continued the hearing on the Motion to Set Aside to March 19, 2024 at 08:30 AM
in Department A14 at Michael Antonovich Antelope Valley Courthouse.
 
No Opposition has been filed. “All
papers opposing a motion so noticed shall be filed with the court and a copy
served on each party at least nine court days. . .before the hearing.” (Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. § 1005(b).) “Section 1013, which extends the time within which
a right may be exercised or an act may be done, does not apply to a notice of
motion, papers opposing a motion, or reply papers governed by this section.” (Ibid.)
The hearing is set for March 19, 2024. Accordingly, an Opposition was due by March
06, 2024. Should an Opposition be filed, it is now untimely. 
 
On March 08, 2024, McIntosh filed
a Supplemental Declaration in Support of the Motion to Set Aside.

Legal Standard
 
Standard to Set Aside – ¿“
‘ A motion for relief under section 473 is addressed to the sound discretion of
the trial court and an appellate court will not interfere unless there is a
clear showing of an abuse.’ ” (Burnete¿v. La Casa Dana Apartments¿(2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 1262, 1266.)¿ “Although a trial court has discretion to vacate the
entry of a default or subsequent judgment, this discretion may be exercised
only after the party seeking relief has shown that there is a proper ground for
relief, and that the party has raised that ground in a procedurally proper
manner, within any applicable time limits.” (Cruz v.¿Fagor¿America, Inc.¿(2007)
146 Cal.App.4th 488, 495.)¿¿¿¿
¿¿¿¿
Additionally,
the California Supreme Court has held the following:¿¿¿¿¿
¿¿¿¿
Section
473 is often applied liberally where the party in default moves promptly to
seek relief, and the party opposing the motion will not suffer prejudice if
relief is granted. [Citations.] In such situations “very slight evidence will
be required to justify a court in setting aside the default.” [Citations.] [¶]
Moreover, because the law strongly favors trial and disposition on the merits,
any doubts in applying section 473 must be resolved in favor of the party
seeking relief from default. [Citations.] Therefore, a trial court order
denying relief is scrutinized more carefully than an order permitting trial on
the merits. [Citations.]¿¿¿¿¿
¿¿¿¿
(Elston¿v. City of Turlock¿(1985)
38 Cal.3d 227, 233-34.)¿¿¿¿
¿¿¿¿
Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. § 473(b) permits the Court to “relieve a party or his or her
legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding
taken against him or through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise or
excusable neglect.”¿(Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 473(b).) “Application for this
relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed
to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall
be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the
judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.” (Id.)¿¿¿

Discussion
 
Application – Plaintiff
presents that his case is similar to Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8
Cal.4th 975 (“Rappleyea”). Plaintiff presents the following as to the
action:
 
·        
No final Judgment has ever been entered by the
Court, despite the fact that the Court ordered Defendant’s counsel to prepare
such a judgment;
·        
The Court issued an Order to Show Cause to the
Defendant that the Defendant submit a proposed Judgment to finalize this case;
·        
This case has no final judgment;
·        
The Court’s Order of dismissal is, in essence,
the entry of a default as to the Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint;
·        
Plaintiff’s counsel has stated under oath the
nature of the fact that he routinely failed to receive notices from the court’s
clerk regarding the results of court hearings and actions taken by the court
independently;
·        
Plaintiff’s counsel had no notice from the Court
clerk, or opposing counsel, that the Court’s request for a time estimate for
the filing of the Amended Complaint would be strictly adhered to;
·        
Defendant’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings
was set for a date after the August 9, 2022, and so the Motion was not properly
before the Court at that time;
·        
When Defendant’s counsel failed to timely do so,
the Court set an Order to Show Cause why Defendant’s counsel should not be
sanctioned for failing to submit a Judgment for the Court to sign;
·        
Defendant’s counsel failed to comply with the
Court’s Order a second time, confirming the Defendant’s complete and total
disinterest in obtaining such a Judgment;
·        
When the Defendant failed to respond to the
continued OSC [Order to Show Cause], the court reversed its decision to award
sanctions to the Defendant because of the lack of diligence on the part of
their counsel; and
·        
Beginning with the August 09, 2022 hearing,
Plaintiff’s counsel did not waive notice and requested Defendant’s counsel give
notice of what transpired. 
 
McIntosh’s declaration presents
the following as to the record:
 
·        
[After Davis filed a Motion for Judgment on the
Pleadings which was set for August 11, 2022], On June 29, 2022, the Court, on
its own Motion and without notice, continued the scheduled Jury Trial date to
August 19, 2022, a date well after the scheduled trial date of July 9, 2022
(Decl. McIntosh ¶ 14);
·        
At the hearing on August 9, 2022, the Court on
its own Motion, raised the issue of Defendant’s pending Motion for Judgment on
the Pleadings, a discussion was held, The Court then asked McIntosh to revise
the Complaint so that it would fully and clearly state the facts underlying the
Plaintiff’s claims in this case, McIntosh stated he would be happy to do so,
the Court inquired as to when McIntosh would be in the position to file the
FAC, McIntosh stated 30 days, and the Court stated that would be fine (Decl.
McIntosh ¶¶ 16-22);
·        
McIntosh requested notice of what occurred and
no notice was given (Decl. McIntosh ¶ 23);
·        
The Court did not state that it was granting
Defendant’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, so McIntosh states that, in
his mind, an informal agreement was reached between himself and the Court
(Decl. McIntosh ¶¶ 25-26);
·        
Defendant refiled his Motion for Judgement on
the Pleadings, but McIntosh was never served (Decl. McIntosh ¶ 28);
·        
A hearing was held in which the Court took the
matter under submission and subsequently issued a minute order (Decl. McIntosh
¶¶ 29-32);
·        
McIntosh never received the Minute Order and
informed the Court, no method of communication with the Court described, that
he had not received any prior Minute Orders from the Court (Decl. McIntosh ¶
33);
·        
Defendant never filed a proposed Judgment, the
Court set an Order to Show Cause (“OSC”) set for March 29, 2023 as to the
failure to submit a proposed judgment, Davis neither filed papers nor appeared,
and the Court continued the matter (Decl. McIntosh ¶¶ 34-37);
·        
At the continued hearing on May 01, 2023, the
Court orally indicated that it intended to dismiss the action and strike its
prior award of sanctions (Decl. McIntosh ¶ 39);
·        
McIntosh was never notified of a final order
(Decl. McIntosh ¶ 40).
 
McIntosh’s declaration also
presents that personal matters arose during this action: (1) his sister’s
passing; (2) McIntosh’s own cancer diagnosis; (3) McIntosh’s relocation to
Texas, and (4) McIntosh’s removal of the glad causing the cancer which McIntosh
believes decreased some of his mental acuity. (Decl. McIntosh ¶¶ 49-53.)
 
Numerous courts have found no
abuse of discretion in granting relief where the motions for relief under Cal. Code
Civ. Proc., § 473(b) were filed five to ten weeks after entry of judgment. (See,
e.g., Minick v. City of Petaluma (2016) 3 Cal. App. 5th 15, 33-34 [5-week
delay acceptable when attorney did not appreciate effects of medication on
ability to practice law]; Freeman v. Goldberg (1961) 55 Cal.2d 622, 625 [10-week
delay acceptable when plaintiff showed evidence that the mail box used to file
opposition was not serviced on time by the USPS]; Hallett v. Slaughter
(1943) 22 Cal.2d 552, 554, 557 [7-week delay acceptable when plaintiff filed
opposition that was never delivered by the USPS]; Outdoor Imports, Inc. v.
Stanoff (1970) 7 Cal.App.3d 518, 523–524 [9-week delay acceptable when
defendant reasonably believed the lawsuit was unfiled].) A delay is
unreasonable as a matter of law only when it exceeds three months and there is
no evidence to explain the delay. ( See Benjamin v. Dalmo Mfg. Co.
(1948) 31 Cal.2d 523, 532; see also Stafford v. Mach (1998) 64
Cal.App.4th 1174, 1184, as modified on denial of reh'g July 8, 1998 [stating
that the “three-month unofficial ‘standard’” established in Benjamin “remains
true today”]; see also Huh v. Wang (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 1406,
1420–1425, as modified Jan. 16, 2008 [the court denied relief to a default to a
summary judgment when the plaintiff made a series of errors including the
failure to respond to discovery, failure to oppose summary judgment, and a
two-month delay in seeking to overturn the judgment based solely on the
attorney being “overwhelmed and disorganized.” The court reasoned that the
attorney's declaration failed to show either a clerical mistake made by a clerk
or legal assistant or extraordinary circumstances such as one or more attorneys
leaving a law firm.]). Rappleyea provides that “relief under section 473 [is]
unavailable” when “more than six months had elapsed from the entry of default.”
(Rappleyea, supra, 8 Cal. 4th 975, 980.)
 
Plaintiff appears to be arguing
the circumstances surrounding both the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings and
the Court’s dismissal of the action. 
 
Regarding the Motion for Judgment
on the Pleadings, the Court provides the following: (1) there was no hearing on
August 09, 2022; (2) there was a hearing on the Motion for Judgment on the
Pleadings to the Complaint, filed June 28, 2022 and continued in open court
with McIntosh present on June 29, 2022, on August 11, 2022 (see 06/29/2022
Minute Order); (3) the Court granted the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings
to the Complaint (see 08/11/2022 Minute Order); (4) McIntosh was present for
the hearing (see ibid.); and (5) the clerk mailed the Minute Order from
the 08/11/2022 hearing, including the ruling on submitted matters, to McIntosh
at 1055 E Colorado Blvd, Ste 500, Pasadena, CA 91106, McIntosh’s then address
of record (see 08/11/2022 Certificate of Mailing). The Court does not enter
into informal agreements. Court action is reflected in either Minute Orders or
Statements of Decision. As explained in Rappleyea, the general rule is
that “relief under section 473 [is] unavailable” when “more than six months had
elapsed from the entry of default.” (Rappleyea, supra, 8 Cal. 4th
975, 980.) Thus, to the extent that this motion pertains to the Motion for
Judgment on the Pleadings, this motion is untimely. 
 
Regarding the Court’s dismissal
of the action, the Court clarifies the following:
 
·        
It is not the Court’s practice to request an
abstract of judgment for dismissals under these circumstances;
·        
The May 01, 2023 Minute Order reflects that
sanctions were vacated and the action was dismissed with prejudice;
·        
McIntosh was present for this hearing (see
05/01/2023 Minute Order);
·        
No Minute Order from the ruling on the Motion
for Judgment on the Pleadings to the FAC to the present reflects a request for Raman
to file a proposed judgment; and
·        
All Minute Orders from August 11, 2022 to
present show McIntosh’s presence at the hearings and, where notice was not
provided by a party, the relevant Minute Orders are accompanied by Certificates
of Mailing that show the Minute Order was served to McIntosh at 1055 E Colorado
Blvd, Ste 500, Pasadena, CA 91106, McIntosh’s then address of record.
 
McIntosh’s Supplemental
Declaration states that on January 16, 2024, the Court “needed to know why no
mention was made in those Declarations of the events of August 9, 2022, and
requested that Plaintiff’s counsel provide a response to that request.” (Supp.
Decl. McIntosh ¶ 3.) McIntosh summarizes the events of the alleged August 09,
2022 hearing from his previous declaration. 
 
On January 16, 2024, the Court
inquired as to (1) why no mention was made as to the August 11, 2022 hearing;
and (2) why the Motion to Set Aside was not served upon Hamid and R&A, LLC.

 
The dismissal in this action was
entered on May 01, 2023. (See 05/01/2023 Minute Order.) Six Months from May 01,
2023 is Wednesday, November 01, 2023. The motion is, likewise, untimely as it
pertains to the order for dismissal as it was filed on November 07, 2023, over
six months since the dismissal was entered. 
 
The Court does not have authority
to relieve Plaintiff from the dismissal under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 473(b) as
this motion has been brought past the time set out by statute. 
 
An exception to this general rule
that relief under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 473 is unavailable when more than six
months have elapsed may be available through the Court’s use of its equitable
powers to grant relief from extrinsic mistake, such relief, however, “may be
given only in exceptional circumstances.” (Rappleyea, supra, 8
Cal. 4th 975, 981.) An extrinsic mistake giving rise to the use of equitable
relief comes from, among other things, “a mistake [leading] a court to do what
it never intended.” (Id. at 981 [quoting Kulchar v. Kulchar
(1969) 1 Cal.3d 467, 471-472]; see also Sullivan v. Lumsden (1897) 118
Cal. 664, 669 [referees’ use of wrong map was extrinsic mistake and equitable
relief was available because “‘it is not a mistake of the law, or an
inadvertent conclusion as to what the law is, but a mistake or inadvertence in
doing something not intended to be done.’”]).
 
Plaintiff was present through his
attorney, McIntosh, at both the hearing on the Motion for Judgment on the
Pleadings on August 11, 2022 and the was present at the May 01, 2023 hearing in
which the case was dismissed with prejudice. (See 08/11/2022 Minute Orders and
May 01, 2023 Minute Order). Further, as to the Motion for Judgment on the
Pleadings, service is presumed if the party serving the document satisfies the
formal requirements of section 1013. (See, e.g., Sharp v. Union Pacific R.R.
Co. (1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 357, 360 [9 Cal. Rptr. 2d 925] [service of notice
of appeal complete when deposited in the mail].)” (Jones v. Catholic
Healthcare West (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 300, 308.) Thus, there is indication
that no mistake occurred as McIntosh was aware that the case was dismissed, but
did not act until after the statutory deadline. 
 
Further, Leader v. Health
Industries of America, Inc. (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 603 (“Leader”) explained
that “the ‘day in court’ envisioned by [prior case law] is not a guaranteed
trial on the merits, but merely the opportunity to appear and present evidence
and argument in opposition” to a motion. (See Leader, supra, 89 Cal.App.4th at
621.) While the motions in Leader’s cited case discussed motions to dismiss,
Leader discussed how their plaintiffs had a day in court in opposition to the
demurrers, availed themselves of the opportunity, had an opportunity to amend,
and belatedly attempted to do so. (See ibid.) That is, the Leader
court held that a trial court acted within its discretion under Code of Civil
Procedure section 58(f)(2), in granting the defendant's motion to dismiss for
failure to file the amendment in time. This is directly applicable to the case
at hand as, though Plaintiff did not file Oppositions[2],
Plaintiff appeared in court, presented oral argument, and had an opportunity to
amend, but did not do so. 
 
The Court notes that had it been
able to relieve Plaintiff under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 473(b), there is no
proposed pleading to accompany this motion. The statute states clearly, in
relevant part: “Application for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy of
the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the
application shall not be granted, . . .” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 473(b)
[emphasis added].)
 
Accordingly, the Motion to Set
Aside is DENIED. 
 
-----
 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Soroush Janamian’s Motion for an Order
Setting Aside Dismissal of Case and Reinstating Case to Civil Active List is
DENIED.
