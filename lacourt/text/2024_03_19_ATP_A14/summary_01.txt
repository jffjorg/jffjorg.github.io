And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Soroush Janamian, has filed a motion to set aside the dismissal of the action and reinstate the case to the civil active list. The judge has reviewed the motion and determined that it is untimely and therefore denied.

The plaintiff alleges that the defendants fraudulently induced him into renting a property and entering into a property management agreement, and that he has suffered damages as a result. The plaintiff claims that the court's dismissal of the action was based on a mistake and that he should be given another opportunity to present his case.

The judge has reviewed the pleadings and evidence presented in the case and has determined that the plaintiff's claims are without merit. The judge has also considered the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal and has determined that it is untimely and therefore denied.

The judge has ordered the plaintiff to pay the costs of the motion to set aside the dismissal and has denied the plaintiff's request to reinstate the case to the civil active list.

The judge's decision is based on the California Civil Procedure Code section 473(b), which provides that a motion to set aside a dismissal must be filed within six months of the date of the dismissal. The judge has determined that the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal is untimely and therefore denied.
