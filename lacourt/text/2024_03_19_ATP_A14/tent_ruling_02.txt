The Court notes that Plaintiff filed a document titled “PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE TO
DEFENDANT RAMAN REFAEI’S NOTICE OF NON-RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT’S TWO MOTIONS” on August
09, 2022 in which McIntosh states that he did not receive the Substitution of
Attorney by Plaintiff, that the trial date was not continued, and no meet and
confer occurred. The June 29, 2022 Minute Order for the hearings held on June
29, 2022 in which McIntosh was present, makes clear that a stipulation to
continue was entered (see also 08/24/2021 Stipulation and Proposed Order
[signed by McIntosh and Mousavi]) and the trial, originally scheduled for July
08, 2022, was continued to August 19, 2022 at 08:30 AM in Department A14 at
Michael Antonovich Antelope Valley Courthouse. The Motion for Judgment on the
Pleadings to the Complaint was served to McIntosh at 1055 E Colorado Blvd, Ste
500, Pasadena, CA 91106, McIntosh’s then address of record and service is
presumed due to the standard discussed, ante.
