Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying the plaintiff's petition to file a late claim against the defendants. The plaintiff alleges that she slipped and fell on September 11, 2021, due to a black oily substance on the ground, and that she has been attempting to informally resolve the claim with the defendants since October 2021. However, the plaintiff did not submit her application to the board to present a late claim until July 28, 2023, which is beyond the one-year deadline specified in Cal. Gov. Code § 911.4(b). The judge finds that the plaintiff has not shown good cause for failing to file the claim within the statutory deadline, and therefore, the petition is denied.
