The court is issuing a tentative ruling to clarify the status of the trial and motions in this case. The plaintiff, McIntosh, filed a document on August 9, 2022, stating that he did not receive the Substitution of Attorney and that the trial date was not continued. However, the court notes that the June 29, 2022 Minute Order shows that a stipulation to continue was entered, and the trial was continued to August 19, 2022. The court also notes that the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings to the Complaint was served to McIntosh at his then address of record, and service is presumed due to standard procedures.
