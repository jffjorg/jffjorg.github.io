The Court notes that the Petition at 6:24, Plaintiff states that relief is
based on Cal. Gov. Code § 945.6(b). The Court believes this to be a scrivener’s
error as (1) the section is titled “GOVERNMNET CODE SECTION 946.6(b)” and (2)
Cal. Gov. Code § 945.6(b) discusses when a person is unable to commence a suit
against a public entity required to be presented in accordance with Cal. Gov.
Code §§ 900 et seq., and 910 et seq. due to imprisonment
and there has been no presentation that Plaintiff was imprisoned.
