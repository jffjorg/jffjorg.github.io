    - "The existence of a confidential relationship generating a fiduciary duty is a question of fact. Nonetheless, because of the vagueness of the common law definition of the confidential relation that gives rise to a fiduciary duty, and the range of the relationships that can potentially be characterized as fiduciary, the 'essential elements' have been distilled as follows: 1) The vulnerability of one party to the other which 2) results in the empowerment of the stronger party by the weaker which 3) empowerment has been solicited or accepted by the stronger party and 4) prevents the weaker party from effectively protecting itself." (Persson v. Smart Inventions, Inc. (2005) 125 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1160-1161)

Here is a summary of the judge's ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the defendants' motion for summary judgment on the first cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty, as there are triable issues of fact. The judge also denies the defendants' motion for summary adjudication of the 4th and 5th causes of action for fraud and fraudulent concealment, as there are triable issues of fact.

The judge grants the defendants' motion for summary adjudication of the 2nd cause of action for negligent misrepresentation, as the alleged misrepresentations do not plead misrepresentation of a past or existing material fact.

The judge grants the defendants' motion for summary adjudication of the 3rd cause of action for negligence, as the claim is barred by the two-year statute of limitations under CCP §335.1.

The judge denies the defendants' motion for summary judgment on the alter ego claim, as there are triable issues of fact.
