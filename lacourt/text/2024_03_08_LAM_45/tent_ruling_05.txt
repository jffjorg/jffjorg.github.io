America Inc.
 
Motion to Compel Further to Request for Production,
Set One
 
Plaintiff
Pablito Buan seeks to compel further responses to his Request for Production of
Documents Nos. 16 through 21. To varying degrees, these requests seek documents
and communications concerning the engine defect in vehicles similar to the subject
vehicle as well as any internal analysis or investigation conducted by defendant
Kia America Inc. (See generally Separate Statement at pp. 3, 11, 20, 28, 37,
45.) The court finds plaintiff Pablito Buan’s discovery requests to be overly broad as it relates to the inclusion of
a “catch-all” within the definition of “Engine Defect” as well as burdensome.
Thus, the court issues the following discovery order:
 
1.    
Defendant
Kia America Inc. (“Kia”) shall produce all documents concerning any internal
analysis or investigation regarding the subject defects in vehicles for the
same year, make, and model of the subject vehicle. These subject defects are limited
to symptoms specifically enumerated within the operative pleadings or the definition
of “Engine Defect” found within Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents.
2.    
Kia
shall produce any customer complaints and warranty claims relating to the
subject defects in vehicles for the same year, make, and model of the subject
vehicle, for the period of the date of purchase to the present. These subject
defects are limited to symptoms specifically enumerated within the operative
pleadings or the definition of “Engine Defect” found within Plaintiff’s Request
for Production of Documents.
3.    
All
other requests for further production are DENIED.  
4.    
Kia
shall provide supplemental responses in compliance with this order within 30
days from the date Plaintiff writes a letter to General Motors for Responses
pursuant to the Standing Discovery Order.
5.    
The
court does not find that the conduct of any party here warrants an award of
monetary sanctions.
 
            It
is so ordered.
