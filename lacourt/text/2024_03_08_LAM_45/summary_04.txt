And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatory 15.1 filed by defendant/cross-complainant Derek Keane. The court grants the motion and orders plaintiff/cross-defendant Lafayette Apt. Associates, LP to serve further verified responses to Form Interrogatory 15.1 within 30 days of the date of this ruling.

The court also grants defendant/cross-complainant Derek Keane's request for monetary sanctions for his motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatory 15.1 in the reduced amount of $500. The court orders Lafayette Apt. Associates, LP and its counsel of record, jointly and severally, to pay $500 to Keane within 20 days of the date of this ruling.

The court's decision is based on the fact that Lafayette Apt. Associates, LP served responses to Form Interrogatories (Set Two) No. 15.1 on March 7, 2023, which were incomplete and failed to identify each denial of a material allegation. The court finds that Lafayette Apt. Associates, LP waived its ability to assert objections to the interrogatory, including the attorney-client privilege and attorney work product, by serving the responses late. The court also finds that Lafayette Apt. Associates, LP's substantive response to Form Interrogatory No. 15.1 is incomplete because it fails to identify each denial of a material allegation as called for in the interrogatory.
