Motion to Compel Arbitration
 
The court has
considered the moving papers and opposition. No reply has been received.
The court DENIES Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc.’s motion to compel
arbitration.
 
Background
            This
is a “lemon law” case. On June 7, 2023, plaintiff Jeff Steven Eustice (“Plaintiff”)
initiated this action against defendant American Honda Motor Co. Inc. (“Defendant”),
alleged the following causes of action: (1) Violation of Subdivision (d) of
Civil Code § 1793.2; (2) Violation of Subdivision (b) of Civil Code § 1793.2;
(3) Violation of Subdivision (a)(3) of Civil Code § 1793.2; (4) Breach of Express
Written Warranty; and (5) Breach of Implied Warranty of Merchantability. Plaintiff
alleges various defects to his 2022 Honda Accord 4D, which he purchased on
March 20, 2022. (Compl. ¶¶ 5, 10-11.)
On December 21, 2023, Defendant filed the
instant motion to compel arbitration. Plaintiff filed an opposition on January
24, 2024. No reply has been received. 
            
Legal
Standard
Under CCP § 1281, a “written agreement
to submit to arbitration an existing controversy or a controversy thereafter
arising is valid, enforceable and revocable, save upon such grounds as exist
for the revocation of any contract.” A party to an arbitration agreement may
seek a court order compelling the parties to arbitrate a dispute covered by the
agreement. (CCP § 1281.2.) The right to arbitration depends upon contract; a
petition to compel arbitration is simply a suit in equity seeking specific
performance of that contract. (Marcus
& Millichap Real Estate Inv. Brokerage Co. v. Hock Inv. Co. (1998) 68
Cal. App.4th 83, 88.)
When presented with a petition to compel
arbitration, the trial court's first task is to determine whether the parties
have in fact agreed to arbitrate the dispute. (Id. at 88.) “[A]bsent a clear agreement to submit disputes to
arbitration, courts will not infer that the right to a jury trial has been
waived.” (Adajar v. RWR Homes, Inc. (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 563, 569,
internal citations and quotations omitted.)
Because the right to arbitration depends
upon contract, the party seeking arbitration bears the initial burden of
proving that the parties actually agreed to arbitrate the instant dispute.  (Hotels
Nevada v. L.A. Pacific Center, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 754, 761.) If
the moving party does so, the burden shifts to the opposing party to show that
the subject agreement is unenforceable. (Id.
at 761.) The court “sits as a trier of fact, weighing all the affidavits,
declarations, and other documentary evidence, as well as oral testimony
received at the court’s discretion, to reach a final determination.” (Engalla v. Permanente Med. Grp., Inc.
(1997) 15 Cal.4th 951, 972.)
 
Discussion
A.   
Request for Judicial Notice
Plaintiff
requests that the court take judicial notice of the following in support of his
opposition: (1) Ford Motor Warranty Cases, No. B312261, 2023 WL 2768484,
(Cal. Ct. App. Apr. 4, 2023) (Exhibit 1); (2) Rosana Montemayor v. Ford
Motor Company, No. B320477, (Cal. Ct. App. Jun. 26, 2023) (Exhibit 2); and
(3) Kielar v. Super. Ct., No. C096773 (Cal. Ct. App. August. 16, 2023)
The court GRANTS
Plaintiff’s request for judicial notice to the extent that the documents are
part of the records of a court of record of the United States and are official
acts of the judicial department of the United States, but not for the truth of
the matter asserted therein. (Evid. Code Code §§ 452(c), (d); see Fremont
Indem. Co. v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 113
[“Although the existence of a document may be judicially noticeable, the truth
of statements contained in the document and its proper interpretation are not
subject to judicial notice if those matters are reasonably disputable.”].)
 
B.   
Compel Arbitration
Defendant moves
for an order to compel Plaintiff to arbitrate the causes of action set forth in
his Complaint.
1.     Existence of an
Arbitration Agreement
In moving for an
order compelling arbitration, Defendant submits the “Retail Installment Sales
Contract” (“RISC) signed by Plaintiff on March 20, 2022. (Motion, Dao Decl. ¶ 2,
Exh. A.) Notably, Defendant is not a signatory to the RISC. The RISC contains
an arbitration provision that states, in relevant part, the following:
PLEASE REVIEW- IMPORTANT
– AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS
1. EITHER YOU OR WE MAY
CHOOSE TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN US DECIDED BY ARBITRATION AND NOT IN COURT
OR BY JURY TRIAL.
2. IF A DISPUTE IS
ARBITRATED, YOU WILL GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS
REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER ON ANY CLASS CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST US
INCLUDING ANY RIGHT TO CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY CONSOLIDATION OF INDIVIDUAL
ARBITRATIONS.
3. DISCOVERY AND RIGHTS
TO APPEAL IN ARBITRATION ARE GENERALLY MORE LIMITED THAN IN A LAWSUIT, AND
OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU AND WE WOULD HAVE IN COURT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN
ARBITRATION.
Any claim or dispute,
whether in contract, tort, statute or otherwise (including the interpretation
and scope of this Arbitration Clause, and the arbitrability of the claim or
dispute), between you and us or our employees, agents, successors or assigns,
which arises out of or relates to your credit application, purchase or
condition of this vehicle, this contract or any resulting transaction or
relationship (including any such relationship with third parties who do not
sign this contract) shall, at your or our election, be resolved by neutral,
binding arbitration and not by a court action. If federal law provides that a
claim or dispute is not subject to binding arbitration, this Arbitration Clause
shall not apply to such claim or dispute. Any claim or dispute is to be
arbitrated by a single arbitrator on an individual basis and not as a class
action.
 (Id.
at pg. 8].) 
            Based
on the presentation of the RISC, the court finds that Defendant has met its
burden in establishing the existence of an arbitration agreement relating to
the subject vehicle. However, because Defendant is not a signatory to RISC, the
issue of whether Defendant has standing to compel arbitration must still be resolved.
This issue shall be discussed further below. 
 
2.     Standing to
Enforce the Arbitration Agreement Pursuant to the Doctrine of Equitable
Estoppel.
When a petitioner seeks to
compel arbitration as to a non-signatory to the arbitration agreement, various
theories are available to support the moving party’s demand, which include the
doctrine of equitable estoppel. (JSM Tuscany, LLC v. Superior Court
(2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 1222, 1237.) Under this doctrine, a nonsignatory
defendant may invoke an arbitration clause to compel a signatory plaintiff to
arbitrate its claims when the causes of action against the nonsignatory are
‘intimately founded in and intertwined’ with the underlying contract
obligations. (Id.)
In arguing that
it has standing to compel arbitration pursuant to the RISC, Defendant relies on
to Felisilda v. FCA US LLC (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 486, review
denied (Nov. 24, 2020). (Motion at pp. 3-5, 11-12.)
In Felisilda, the Court of Appeal found that purchasers of a
vehicle were estopped from refusing to arbitrate Song-Beverly Act claims
against the vehicle manufacturer, based on an agreement between the purchaser
and the vehicle dealer. (See Felisilda, supra, at 496-99.) While Felisilda
constituted precedential authority at one point, it is no longer good law.
In Kielar v. Superior Court of Placer Cnty. (2023) 94 Cal.App.5th 614,
the Third District Court of Appeal expressly repudiated Felisilda. (Id.
at 616.) The Third District issued a preemptory writ of mandate directing the
trial court in the case to vacate an order compelling arbitration of a
plaintiff’s Song-Beverly Act claims against an automobile manufacturer based on
an arbitration clause in the purchase agreement between the plaintiff and the
dealer from which the plaintiff purchased the automobile.  (Ibid.)  The trial court order in Keilar was
premised on Felisilda’s view that the doctrine of equitable estoppel
applied in this context.  (Ibid.)  The Third District in Keilar held otherwise.  (Ibid.)
In abandoning Felisilda, the Third District in Keilar
adopted instead the rulings of Division Eight of the Second District in the Ford
Motor Warranty Cases, known by the lead case, Ochoa v. Ford Motor Co.
(2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324, and Division Seven of the Second District in Montemayor
v. Ford Motor Company (2023) 92 Cal.App.5th 958 (Montemayor). 
(See Keilar, supra, 94 Cal.App.5th at 620-621 [discussing Ochoa
and Montemayor].  The Courts in Ochoa and Montemayor
rejected the reasoning of Felisilda and held that the claims against a
non-signatory automobile manufacturer are not intimately founded in and
intertwined with the obligations in the contract containing the arbitration
clause between the plaintiff and the dealer from which the plaintiff purchased
the automobile at issue, and therefore the manufacturer could not invoke the
doctrine of equitable estoppel to enforce the arbitration clause.  (Ochoa,
supra, 89 Cal.App.5th at 1333,1335-1336; Montemayor, supra,
92 Cal.App.5th at 969-971.) Thus, Defendant’s reliance on Felisilda in
this instance is misplaced.
Accordingly, because the doctrine of equitable estoppel does not apply
here, Defendnat lacks standing to compel arbitration pursuant to the RISC.
 
3.    
Standing to
Enforce Arbitration Agreement Pursuant to the Doctrine of Third-Party
Beneficiary.
While not directly argued within Defendant’s
moving papers, Plaintiff contends that Defendant also unsuccessfully invokes
the doctrine of third-party beneficiary as a means to establish standing.
(Opposition at pp. 12-14.) Ultimately, the court agrees with Plaintiff and
finds that this doctrine does not apply.
To invoke the
third-party beneficiary exception, the non-signatory must show that the
arbitration clause of the agreement was “made expressly for [their]
benefit.”  (Civ. Code, § 1559.) It is
“not necessary that the beneficiary be named and identified as an individual. A
third party may enforce a contract where he shows that he is a member of a
class of persons for whose benefit it was made.”  (Garratt v. Baker (1936) 5 Cal.2d 745,
748; accord, Cargill, Inc. v. Souza (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 962, 967.)
A third party is
entitled to enforce a contract where: (1) it benefits from the contract, (2) a
motivating purpose of the contracting parties was to provide a benefit to the
third party, and (3) permitting the third party to enforce the contract is
consistent with the objectives of the contract and reasonable expectations of
the parties.  (Goonewardene v. ADP,
LLC (2019) 6 Cal.5th 817, 830.)
Defendant has
failed to show that the RISC was expressly made for its benefit. Rather, it
appears that the RISC was drafted for the purpose of securing benefits for the
contracting parties. (See Dao Decl, Exh. A.) This is evidenced by the fact
that, other than referencing the contracting parties, the arbitration provision
only refers to the finance company’s employees, agents, successors or assigns.
Thus, Defendant may not rely on the third-beneficiary doctrine as a means of
enforcing the arbitration provision within the RISC.
Accordingly,
because the RISC was not created for Defendant’s benefit, the third-party
beneficiary doctrine does not apply. 
 
Based on the foregoing reasons, the court
finds Defendant lacks standing to enforce the RISC. Thus, Plaintiff’s action is
not subject to arbitration.
The court therefore DENIES Defendant’s
motion to compel arbitration. 
 
            It
is so ordered.
