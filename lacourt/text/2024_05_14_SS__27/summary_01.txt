And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"The court has denied the defendants' sixth motion to quash the summons, which argued that service by publication was improper and violated the Hague Convention. The court has already ruled on these issues on the merits concerning the service by publication in the Los Angeles Times. The parties are notified that if they intend to submit on this tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number. If the parties neither submit nor appear at the hearing, the court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the court."
