presently scheduled for June 18, 2024, to April 8, 2025, or to a date
thereafter convenient to the Court’s calendar. The Court continued the trial
date to January 27, 2025. The present motion seeks the same continuance as
requested in the stipulation. Since the stipulation was granted, the present
motion is moot and therefore denied.
