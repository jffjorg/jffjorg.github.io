And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion by Colin M. Jones, the counsel for the plaintiff, to be relieved as counsel due to an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The motion is unopposed, and the court finds that this is proper grounds for withdrawal. However, the court is concerned that granting the motion now may disrupt the orderly process of justice, as the next hearing is set for May 29, 2024, and the trial is currently scheduled for June 10, 2024. Therefore, the court continues the motion until May 29, 2024.
