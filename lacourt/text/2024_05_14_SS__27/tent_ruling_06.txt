CASE NO./NAME: 22STCV35971
SHATAIRAH WILSON, et al. vs STORPA INVESTMENTS 2
Moving Party: Plaintiff’s Counsel Colin
M. Jones  
Responding Party: Unopposed  
Notice: Sufficient  
  
Ruling:
MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL IS CONTINUED.
  
Background 
 
Attorney Colin M. Jones represents
Plaintiff. Jones moves to be relieved as counsel, citing an irremediable
breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. No opposition has been filed. 
 
Legal Standard¿ 
¿ 
The Court has discretion to allow
an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided that
there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process
of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People
v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 403-407.) 
¿ 
A motion to be relieved as counsel
must be made on Judicial Council Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion),
MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) The requisite forms must be served “on the
client and on all parties that have appeared in the case.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1362, subd. (d).) 
¿ 
Analysis and Conclusion¿ 
¿ 
Jones has
filed Judicial Council Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052
(Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). Jones seeks to be relieved as
counsel for Plaintiff on the grounds that there has been a breakdown in the
attorney-client relationship. The Court finds this to be proper grounds for
withdrawal. (See Estate of Falco (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014 (a
breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is grounds for allowing the
attorney to withdraw).) Jones states that Plaintiff has
retained another attorney for the same cause of action arising from this
incident, which has since been settled. 
 
The Court notes that the next hearing, an Order to Show Cause Re:
Dismissal, is set for May 29, 2024, which is only 15 days away.  Trial is currently scheduled for June 10,
2024.  Based on the fact that these dates
are both less than a month away, the Court is concerned that granting Jone’s
motion now may disrupt the orderly process of justice.  At the same time, based on the information
provided by Jones, it appears that dismissal may be appropriate.  Accordingly, the Court hereby continues this
motion until May 29, 2024.
