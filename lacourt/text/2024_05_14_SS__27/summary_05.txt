Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to compel defendant's deposition, denying defendant's objection to the deposition notice. The court finds that defendant's objection was untimely, and plaintiff has fulfilled the requirements to compel defendant's deposition. The court also reduces the amount of sanctions requested by plaintiff from $1,321.65 to $750.

The court denies defendant's motion for sanctions, finding that the motion was untimely and defendant failed to provide sufficient notice of the hearing. The court also denies plaintiff's motion to compel compliance with defendant's response to plaintiff's request for production of documents, finding that defendant has produced all responsive documents in its possession, custody, or control.
