The court grants Defendant Mission Critical Restoration Services' motion for site inspection, allowing for a site inspection of Plaintiffs' premises within 30 days of this order. Additionally, the court grants the request for monetary sanctions against Plaintiffs and their attorney of record, jointly and severally, in the reduced amount of $622.50. The court reduces the original amount of $960 to $622.50 due to the lack of opposition from Plaintiffs.
