The court has considered the motion filed by the defendants, Stephan Filip PC and Stephan Airapetian, to compel compliance with a subpoena duces tecum served on Specialty Eye Center. The court grants the motion and orders Specialty Eye Center to produce the requested documents within 20 days of this order. The defendants served the subpoena in December 2020, seeking documents related to the plaintiff's eye injuries and treatment. Despite an attempt to meet and confer, Specialty Eye Center failed to comply with the subpoena. The court finds that the defendants have demonstrated good cause for the production of business records, and the plaintiff does not oppose the motion. The court orders Specialty Eye Center to produce the requested documents within 20 days of this order.
