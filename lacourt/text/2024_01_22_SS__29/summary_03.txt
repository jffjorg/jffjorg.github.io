Summary:

The Court is considering a motion for summary judgment filed by Torrance Refining Company, LLC (TORC) in a case involving injuries sustained by Plaintiff Willie Davis while working at a job site owned and/or operated by TORC. The Court has tentatively ruled that TORC has met its initial burden of showing that there is a complete defense (the Privette doctrine) to the cause of action asserted by Plaintiff against TORC. The Court has questions for counsel regarding the hiring of Schultz Industrial Services, Inc. to deliver and install the steel plates, the responsibility for determining that Schultz performed its installation in a safe manner, and the decision to ask Schultz to deliver and install the steel plates without requesting welding services. The Court will consider these issues further before making a final ruling on the motion for summary judgment.
