And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has made a tentative ruling on a motion to consolidate two cases: Marinero Action (Case No. 21STCV23847) and Smith Action (Case No. 21STCV24492). The cases involve the same automobile accident on July 6, 2019, and the same defendant, Angelica Bianca Diaz. The court has determined that the cases are related and have been pending in the same department. The motion to consolidate was filed by Diaz, but it does not comply with the requirements of the California Rules of Court, as it was not filed in both cases. Therefore, the court cannot grant the motion at this time. The court has continued the hearing to allow Diaz to cure this procedural defect and satisfy the requirements of the rules.
