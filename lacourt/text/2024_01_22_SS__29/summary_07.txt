And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to set aside the dismissal of the action brought by plaintiffs Linda Allen and Rhonda Rumble against the City of Los Angeles. The dismissal was entered on August 1, 2023, after no default judgment papers were submitted by the plaintiffs' counsel. The judge found that the dismissal occurred due to counsel's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, and that the plaintiffs have acted diligently in seeking relief. The judge ordered the plaintiffs' counsel, Elliott N. Tiomkin, to pay $250 to the State Bar Client Security Fund and to file proof of payment with the court by February 29, 2024. The judge also set an Order to Show Cause as to why the action should not be dismissed for failure to request a default judgment for March __, 2024.
