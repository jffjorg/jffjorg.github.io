And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants in part and denies in part the motion for pre-trial discovery (Pitchess motion) filed by the plaintiffs. The motion seeks discovery of peace officer personnel records related to Defendant Alfredo Gutierrez, who is alleged to have been involved in the negligent operation of a motorcycle that resulted in the death of the decedent.

The judge grants the motion as to the records in categories 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6, which relate to Defendant Gutierrez's traffic violations, collisions, and accidents, as well as his tardiness and disciplinary actions. The judge also grants the motion in part as to the records in category 7, which relate to sustained findings of dishonesty, but narrows the scope of the request to specifically exclude certain types of misconduct.

The judge denies the motion as to the records in category 3, which relate to the use of force resulting in death or great bodily injury, finding that the allegations in this case do not involve the use of force.

The judge orders the custodian of records for the California Highway Patrol to bring all relevant records to the court for in-camera review. The moving party is ordered to give notice of the ruling.
