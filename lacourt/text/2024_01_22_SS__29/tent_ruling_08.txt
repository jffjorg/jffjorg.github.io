 Case Number:  22STCV01966    Hearing Date:   January 22, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to continue trial filed by Defendant Wing Lai.
 
Tentative
The motion is DENIED.
Background
On January 18, 2022, Plaintiff Tigran
Galstyan (“Galstyan”) filed a complaint against Defendant Wing Lai (“Lai”), and
Does 1 through 25, alleging nine causes of action for: (1) Negligence, (2) Trespass,
(3) Private Nuisance, (4) Violation of Health and Safety Code section 13007,
(5) Negligent Misrepresentation, (6) Intentional Misrepresentation, (7)
Concealment, (8) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, and (9)
Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress. 
According to the complaint, a large fire originated on Lai’s property
and spread to Galstyan’s causing extensive damage, and then Lai made
misrepresentations about the cause and origin of the fire, causing Galstyan to
suffer further damages and emotion distress.
 
Lai filed her answer to the complaint
on March 16, 2022.
 
In a separate case, Case No.
22STCV14996, Plaintiff Allstate Insurance Company (“Allstate”) filed its
complaint against Galstyan and Does 1 through 20 on May 5, 2022, asserting three
causes of action in subrogation for: (1) Premises Liability, (2) General
Negligence, and (3) Trespass.  In its complaint,
Allstate alleges that it insured Lai’s property; that Galstyan’s actions or
inactions caused the fire and resulting damage to Lai’s property; and that as a
result Allstate suffered a loss. 
Galstyan filed his answer on July 5, 2022.
 
The two cases were related on August
5, 2022, and consolidated for all purposes on May 19, 2023.
 
On December 27, 2023, Lai a motion to
continue trial.  Galstyan filed his
opposition on January 8, 2024. 
 
Defendant filed his motion for
summary judgment on January 16, 2024. 
The motion is set for hearing on March 10, 2025. 
 
Trial is currently scheduled for April
30, 2024.
 
Legal Standard
Code Civ. Proc. § 128(a)(8) provides that the
court has the power to amend and control its process and orders so as to make
them conform to law and justice. “The power to determine when a continuance
should be granted is within the discretion of the trial court.” (Color-Vue,
Inc. v. Abrams (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1599, 1603.) “A trial court has wide
latitude in the matter of calendar control including the granting or denying of
continuances.” (Park Motors, Inc. v. Cozens (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 12, 18.)  
Each request for a continuance must be
considered on its own merits according to California Rules of Court, Rule
3.1332(c). The court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of
good cause requiring the continuance. Circumstances of good cause include:  
“(1) The unavailability of an essential lay
or expert witness because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstances;  
(2) The unavailability of a party because of
death, illness, or other excusable circumstances;  
(3) The unavailability of trial counsel
because of death, illness, or other excusable circumstances;  
(4) The substitution of trial counsel, but
only where there is an affirmative showing that the substitution is required in
the interests of justice;  
(5) The addition of a new party if: (A) The
new party has not had a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare
for trial; or (B) The other parties have not had a reasonable opportunity to
conduct discovery and prepare for trial in regard to the new party's
involvement in the case;  
(6) A party's excused inability to obtain
essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent
efforts; or  
(7) A significant, unanticipated change in
the status of the case as a result of which the case is not ready for
trial.”  
 
(Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1332(c).)  
 
California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332 sets
forth a list of non-exhaustive factors to be analyzed when determining whether
good cause for a trial continuance is present. A court considers factors such
as:  
“(1) The proximity of the trial date;  
(2) Whether there was any previous
continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to any party;  
(3) The length of the continuance
requested;  
(4) The availability of alternative means to
address the problem that gave rise to the motion or application for a
continuance;  
(5) The prejudice that parties or witnesses
will suffer as a result of the continuance; 
(6) If the case is entitled to a preferential
trial setting, the reasons for that status and whether the need for a
continuance outweighs the need to avoid delay; 
(7) The court's calendar and the impact of
granting a continuance on other pending trials; 
(8) Whether trial counsel is engaged in
another trial;  
(9) Whether all parties have stipulated to a
continuance;  
(10) Whether the interests of justice are
best served by a continuance, by the trial of the matter, or by imposing
conditions on the continuance; and  
(11) Any other fact or circumstance relevant
to the fair determination of the motion or application.”  
 
(Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332(d).) 
Discussion
The sole basis for Lai’s motion to continue is to allow for her summary
judgment motion to be heard.
Lai filed this motion on December 27, 2023.  On December 19, Lai reserved a hearing date
for a summary judgment motion; at the time, the first available hearing date,
which Lai reserved, was March 10, 2025. 
(Sullivan Decl., ¶ 5.)  That is
more than ten months after the trial date.
In her moving papers, Lai’s attorney explains that, based on the
current trial date, the last date for a hearing on her summary judgment motion
is March 29, 2024.  (Id., ¶ 4.)  The
last date to file a motion for summary judgment, based on the current trial
date and assuming the minimum statutory notice, is January 12, 2024.  (Ibid.)  Counsel stated that Lai was prepared to file
a timely motion for summary judgment by January 12.  (Id., ¶ 7.)
Lai did not, however, file a motion for summary judgment on or before
January 12.  Instead, she filed a motion
for summary judgment on January 16, 2024. 
This motion is not timely based on the current trial date.
Lai offers no explanation for why she did not file her summary judgment
motion in timely fashion.  
The law is clear that a party has a right to have a timely filed motion
for summary judgment heard before trial. 
(Sentry
Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529 [“A trial court
may not refuse to hear a summary judgment motion filed within the time limits
of section 437c.”]; accord Cole v. Superior Court (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th
84, 88.)  But a party has no right to
have an untimely filed motion for summary judgment heard before trial.  Nor may a party force a continuance by filing
such an untimely motion.
“[T]he dates assigned for a trial
are firm.  All parties and their counsel
must regard the date set for trial as certain.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(a).) 
Filing an untimely motion for summary judgment is not good cause for a continuance
of the trial date, and Lai offers no other basis for her requested continuance.
Accordingly, the motion to
continue trial is DENIED.
Conclusion
The Court DENIES
Lai’s motion to continue trial. 
Moving Party is
ORDERED to give notice.
