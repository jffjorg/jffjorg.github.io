Motion to be Relieved as Counsel, filed by Plaintiff’s
Counsel Edward M. Morgan.
 
Tentative
 
The motion is DENIED without prejudice.
 
Background
On November 15, 2022, Clifford Flores (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendant City
of Los Angeles, County Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County, County of
Los Angeles, California Department of Transportation, William M. Dismuke, and
Does 1 through 50 relating to a motor vehicle accident on February 3, 2022. 
On October 23, 2023, Edward M. Morgan filed a motion to be relieved as
counsel for Plaintiff. No opposition has been filed. 
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
Counsel has
filed the Notice, Declaration, and Order to be Relieved as Counsel. 
In his
Declaration (MC-052), Counsel states Plaintiff has been personally served and
that the proof of service will be filed with the court at least five days
before the hearing.  As of January 19,
2024, no proof of personal service appears in the file. 
Accordingly, the
motion is DENIED without prejudice.
Conclusion
The motion to be
relieved as counsel is DENIED without prejudice.
Moving counsel
to give notice.
