Here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the action. The plaintiff, Zuly Fabiola Ospino, filed a complaint in 2018 against the defendant, Reece Wayne Souza, Los Angeles County Sheriff, and Does 1 through 100. The defendant did not appear, and no proof of service was filed. The action was dismissed in 2019. The plaintiff filed multiple motions to set aside the dismissal, but was denied. The court rules that the plaintiff's motion is untimely, as it was filed over three years after the dismissal. The court also finds that the plaintiff has not made a sufficient showing for an order granting relief. The court has the inherent authority to vacate a default and default judgment on equitable grounds such as extrinsic fraud or extrinsic mistake, but the plaintiff's motion does not meet the requirements for such relief.
