And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to continue the trial filed by defendant Wing Lai. The judge has denied the motion, finding that it is not justified. Lai's sole basis for the motion is to allow for her summary judgment motion to be heard, but she filed the motion late and did not explain why she did not file it in a timely fashion. The judge notes that a party has a right to have a timely filed motion for summary judgment heard before trial, but not an untimely filed motion. The judge also notes that the dates assigned for the trial are firm and must be regarded as certain by all parties and their counsel.
