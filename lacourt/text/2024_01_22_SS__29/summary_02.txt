And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel the deposition of witness Oliver Villamil. The Plaintiff, Ramiro Martinez Gomez, had filed a complaint against several defendants, including DAMCO International, DAMCO Distribution Services, Inc, DAMCO USA, INC, and Victor Flores, alleging motor vehicle negligence and general negligence arising from a forklift accident in 2018. The Plaintiff had issued two deposition subpoenas to Oliver Villamil, a non-party witness, but he failed to appear for both depositions. The Plaintiff filed a motion to compel Oliver Villamil to appear for deposition, but the motion was denied without prejudice for lack of proper service. The Judge noted that California Rules of Court, rule 3.1346, requires that a non-party deponent must be personally served with a motion to compel, unless the deponent agrees to mail service or electronic service.
