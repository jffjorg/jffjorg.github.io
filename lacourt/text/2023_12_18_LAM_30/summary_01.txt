And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiffs' first amended complaint (FAC). The court rules that the demurrer is sustained as to all claims against Goldrich, Kest, Hirsch & Stern, LLC, Goldrich Kest, LLC, and Goldrich & Kest Industries, LLC, as the FAC fails to plead sufficient facts to support alter ego liability. The court also rules that the demurrer is sustained as to the sixth and ninth causes of action against GK Management Co., Inc. and Dolphin Marina Ltd., as these claims fail to plead the necessary elements of trespass and fraud.

The court overrules the demurrer as to all other causes of action, finding that the FAC is sufficient to state claims for negligent infliction of emotional distress (NIED) and trespass. The court also rules that the plaintiffs have pled sufficient facts to state a claim for NIED, despite the defendants' contention that the plaintiffs have failed to plead the necessary elements of a present physical injury or illness.

The court's ruling is based on the facts alleged in the FAC, which states that the plaintiffs entered into a lease for an apartment in Marina Del Rey and that the defendants advised them of planned construction and relocation. The construction began on March 28, 2022, without prior notice, and has caused substantial noises, vibrations, and debris in and around the plaintiffs' unit. The plaintiffs have been exposed to asbestos and other toxic substances as a result of the construction.
