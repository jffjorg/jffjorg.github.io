And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the Motion to be Relieved as Counsel filed by Plaintiff's Counsel, Roger E. Naghash. The motion was filed on March 22, 2024, and no opposition or response has been filed. The judge has determined that the motion complies with the requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. However, the judge notes that there is a significant risk of prejudice to Plaintiff Pamela Buzzanco by the proposed withdrawal of counsel, as Defendant Merrill has already filed a Demurrer to the Verified Complaint. Despite this, the judge believes that Plaintiff will have enough time to find new counsel and continue prosecuting the case.
