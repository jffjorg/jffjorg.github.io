And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions for sanctions brought by plaintiff David Abbasi against defendant Jerry Davidson. The motions are based on Jerry Davidson's failure to comply with court orders compelling further responses to special interrogatories, requests for production, and requests for admission. The judge finds that Jerry Davidson disobeyed the court's orders and failed to serve the supplemental discovery responses. Despite this, the judge will only impose further monetary sanctions on Jerry Davidson and his counsel, Perrin Davidson, and will not grant terminating, issue, or evidence sanctions. The judge grants the motions for sanctions regarding special interrogatories, requests for production, and requests for admission, and orders Jerry Davidson and his counsel to pay plaintiff $3,910, $3,560, and $3,210 in sanctions, respectively.
