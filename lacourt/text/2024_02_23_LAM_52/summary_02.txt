Summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the City of Los Angeles's motion to continue the trial and discovery deadlines. The City had sought to continue the trial by six months, citing the need for more time to finish plaintiff Randy Rangel's deposition and depose other witnesses. However, the Judge found that the City did not demonstrate good cause for the continuance, as it failed to begin discovery until October 2023 and did not initiate written discovery until then. The Judge also noted that the City did not explain why it did not begin discovery earlier and did not move to reopen discovery despite the discovery deadlines having passed. The Judge cited California law and case precedent in support of its decision, including the importance of ensuring the prompt disposition of civil cases and the need for diligent preparation for trial.
