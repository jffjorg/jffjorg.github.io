```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendant's unopposed motion to quash the service of summons on the plaintiff's complaint. The motion is denied as moot because the plaintiff has filed a first amended complaint that corrects the errors and deficiencies of the original pleading. The defendant had previously accepted service of the amended complaint and acknowledged receipt of the summons. Therefore, the judge finds that the service of summons is valid and the motion to quash is denied.
