 Hearing Date:  November 12, 2024



 
Defendant Super Center Concepts, Inc.’s
motion to compel arbitration of Plaintiff Kenya Scurlock’s claims in this
action is continued to Wednesday, November 20, 2024, at
8:30 AM.  Plaintiff and Defendant are instructed to
file simultaneous supplemental briefs regarding the application of the Ending
Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act (“EFAA”) to this
matter by Friday, November 15, 2024, at 12:00 PM.
 
Defendant Super Center Concepts, Inc. (“Super Center”)
(“Defendant”) moves for an order compelling arbitration of all claims asserted
by Plaintiff Kenya Scurlock (“Scurlock”) (“Plaintiff”).  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2; 9 U.S.C. §§1 et
seq.; C.C.P. §§1281.2 et seq.)  
 
Evidentiary Objections
Plaintiff’s 10/23/24 evidentiary objections to the Declaration of Enrique
Montes (“Montes”) are overruled as to Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
 
Background
On May 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant action against
Defendant, asserting four causes of action: (1) sexual harassment in violation
of FEHA; (2) retaliation in violation of FEHA; (3) age discrimination in
violation of FEHA; and (4) failure to prevent harassment, discrimination, and retaliation
in violation of FEHA in connection with Plaintiff’s employment by Defendant in
the deli department located in store number 127.  (See Complaint ¶8.)  
Defendant filed the instant motion on August 16, 2024.  Plaintiff filed her opposition on October 23,
2024.  On October 29, 2024, Defendant
filed its reply.
 
Motion to Compel Arbitration

          Neither party addresses the Ending
Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act (“EFAA”) in
their briefs.  The Rules of Professional
Conduct instructed that a lawyer shall not “fail to disclose to the
tribunal legal authority in the controlling jurisdiction known to the lawyer
to be directly adverse to the position of the client and not disclosed by
opposing counsel, or knowingly misquote to a tribunal the language of a
book, statute, decision or other authority.” 
(RPC, Rule 3.3(a)(2), emphasis added.) 

          Here, Defendant argues that the FAA
governs the Arbitration Agreement. 
(Motion, pg. 5.)  Plaintiff’s
opposition does not address the EFAA. 
Defendant’s reply also does not address the EFAA.  However, Plaintiff’s Complaint raises FEHA
sex/gender harassment and retaliation claims, which would implicate the EFAA.
          Accordingly, the Court seeks
simultaneous, supplemental briefs from counsel regarding the applicability of
the EFAA to the instant matter.
          Defendant’s motion is continued to
Wednesday, November 20, 2024, at 8:30 AM. 
Plaintiff and Defendant are instructed to file simultaneous supplemental
briefs regarding the application of the EFAA to this matter by Friday, November
15, 2024, at 12:00 PM.
 
Conclusion
Defendant’s
motion to compel arbitration is continued to Wednesday, November 20,
2024, at 8:30 AM.  Plaintiff and
Defendant are instructed to file simultaneous supplemental briefs regarding the
application of the EFAA to this matter by Friday, November 15, 2024, at 12:00
PM.
Moving Party to
give notice.
