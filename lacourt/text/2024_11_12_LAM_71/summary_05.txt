And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge continues the hearing on Defendant's motion to compel arbitration of Plaintiff's claims to November 20, 2024, at 8:30 AM. The motion is opposed by Plaintiff, who alleges sexual harassment, retaliation, and age discrimination in violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA). The judge notes that neither party addressed the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act (EFAA) in their briefs, despite the fact that Plaintiff's Complaint raises FEHA sex/gender harassment and retaliation claims. The judge therefore instructs counsel to file simultaneous, supplemental briefs regarding the application of the EFAA to the instant matter by November 15, 2024, at 12:00 PM.
