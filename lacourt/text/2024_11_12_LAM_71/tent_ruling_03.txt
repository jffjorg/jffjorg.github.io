Specially
Appearing Defendant in pro per, Gerardo Friend’s, unopposed
motion to quash service of summons of Plaintiff Downtown Qof II, LLC’s
complaint is denied as moot.  
 
Specially Appearing Defendant Gerardo Friend (“Friend”)
(“Specially Appearing Defendant”), in pro per, moves unopposed to
quash service of summons by Plaintiff Downtown Qof II, LLC’s (“Downtown”)
(“Plaintiff”).  (Notice of Motion, pg. 1;
C.C.P. §418.10(a)(1).)
 
Background
Plaintiff filed its initial Complaint on May 15,
2024, for unlawful detainer against Specially Appearing Defendant arising from
his tenancy at 1348 South Flower St., Los Angeles, CA 90015 (“Subject
Premises”), which is owned by Plaintiff. 
(Complaint ¶¶3-4.)
On August 19, 2024, Specially Appearing
Defendant filed a notice of performance
tender and delivery of possession, indicating that keys and possession of the
at-issue premises was delivered to the landlord on June 14, 2024.  (8/19/24 Notice.)
Specially Appearing Defendant filed the instant
motion on August 20, 2024.  As of the
date of this hearing no opposition has been filed.
On October 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed a first
amended complaint (“FAC”).  On November
5, 2024, Plaintiff filed a notice and acknowledgement of receipt indicating
that the FAC and summons were served on Specially Appearing Defendant.
 
Legal Standard
“A motion to quash service is the proper method
for determining whether the court has acquired personal jurisdiction over the
defendant through service of the five-day unlawful detainer summons.”  (Delta Imports, Inc. v. Municipal Court
(1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 1033, 1035.)  “If
the underlying complaint fails to state a cause of action for unlawful
detainer, then use of the five-day summons is improper, and the defendant is
entitled to an order quashing service as a matter of law.”  (Id.)
A demurrer is the proper procedure for
challenging the sufficiency of a complaint. 
A motion to quash is the proper method to challenge service of summons
where no unlawful detainer is pled.  (Id.
at pg. 1036.)  This follows because the
special five-day summons can only be used with an unlawful detainer
complaint.  (Stancil v. Superior Court
(2021) 11 Cal.5th 381, 397.) (Compare Borsuk v. Appellate Division of
Superior Court (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 607, 616-617.)
Motions to quash can be used where there are no
unlawful detainer claims, but cannot be used “to argue the plaintiff failed to
comply with the pleading requirements specific to unlawful detainer actions set
out in [C.C.P.] section 1166” or to contest the truth of the complaint’s
allegations.  (Stancil, 11 Cal.5th
at pg.  391.)
 
Discussion
Specially Appearing Defendant’s motion to quash
Plaintiff’s service of summons of the initial complaint is denied as moot.
Each party has the right to amend its pleadings
once—without leave of court—within a brief time after its original pleading is
filed. The purpose is to facilitate prompt correction of errors or deficiencies
in the original pleading. (Hedwall v. PCMV, LLC (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th
564, 574.)  Plaintiffs can amend their
complaint once without leave of court before defendant’s answer, demurrer, or
motion to strike is filed.  (C.C.P. §472;
see Woo v. Superior Court (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 169, 175.)
Here, Plaintiff filed the operative FAC on
October 2, 2024, and filed proof of Specially Appearing Defendant’s Acknowledgment
of Receipt of the FAC and summons. 
Plaintiff corrected the errors and deficiencies of the original
pleading.  (Hedwall, 22 Cal.App.5th
564, 574.)  Further, Plaintiff’s
amendment to the complaint was proper because Specially Appearing Defendant’s
motion to quash did not necessitate Plaintiff to seek leave of court before
filing the FAC.  (C.C.P. §472.)  Regarding the instant motion, Specially
Appearing Defendant has accepted service of the FAC by signing the Acknowledgment
of Receipt.
Accordingly, Specially Appearing Defendant’s
motion to quash Plaintiff’s service of summons is denied as moot.
 
Conclusion
Specially Appearing Defendant’s unopposed motion to quash service of summons is denied as moot.  
Moving Party to give notice.
