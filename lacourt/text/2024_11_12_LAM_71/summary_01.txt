  - "If the motion to amend is timely made and the granting of the motion will not prejudice the opposing party, it is error to refuse permission to amend and where the refusal also results in a party being deprived of the right to assert a meritorious cause of action or a meritorious defense, it is not only error but an abuse of discretion." (Morgan v. Superior Court (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527, 530)

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. The plaintiff may file the proposed second amended complaint with the court. The defendant's motion to amend their answer is denied as moot. The judge has based this decision on the fact that the plaintiff's motion is timely and will not prejudice the defendant. The judge has also considered the strong policy favoring amendment and has determined that denial of leave to amend would rarely be justified. The judge has also denied the defendant's motion to amend their answer as moot, as the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint has been granted.
