                                  Plaintiff,
  
         v.
 
 
GARY C. ETO,
 
                                  Defendant.
 


 Case No: 
  23STCV22492
 
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  January 23, 2024
 Calendar Number:  8



 
 
 
Defendant the Honorable Gary C. Eto (“Defendant”) demurs to
the Complaint filed by Plaintiff Korie Schmidt (“Plaintiff”).
 
The Court SUSTAINS Defendant’s demurrer WITHOUT LEAVE TO
AMEND.
 
Background
 
Plaintiff filed this action on September 18, 2023. The
Complaint is styled as a “Complaint for Mandamus Damages” and states that it raises
claims for (1) disability discrimination in violation of Civil Code, section 52
and 42 U.S.C. 12101; and (2) “holding a meeting in violation of open meeting
law.”
 
The following allegations come from Plaintiff’s Complaint
and the declaration Plaintiff attached to the Complaint.  Plaintiff has a friend is a party to a case
(the “Underlying Action”) before Defendant in the Superior Court of California.
(According to Defendant, the friend’s name is Armando Herman.)  According to the Complaint, the Underlying
Action is Case No. 23STRO046 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse. Defendant is the
presiding judge in the Underlying Action.
 
Plaintiff alleges that Plaintiff “needed to judge to hear
evidence that was extremely pertinent to the case that would eradicate any
argument the other side could have against [their] friend.” (Schmidt Decl. ¶
11.) Plaintiff alleges that unfavorable rulings were entered against the friend
as a result of the hearing.
 
Plaintiff alleges that that Plaintiff has a number of
physical disabilities.
 
On September 14, 2023, Plaintiff attempted to attend a
hearing in the Underlying Action to support their friend. Defendant had
determined that members of the public other than parties and witnesses were to
be excluded from the hearing. As a result, Plaintiff was not permitted to enter
the courtroom or be present for the hearing.
 
Plaintiff seeks damages as well as the reversal of rulings
made by Defendant against Plaintiff’s friend in Case No. 23STRO046 on September
14, 2023. Th
 
Defendant demurred to the Complaint on November 21, 2023.
Plaintiff did not file an opposition.
 
Legal Standard
 
As a general matter, in a demurrer proceeding, the defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins.
Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the pleading
alone, and not the evidence or facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants,
Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) The court assumes the truth
of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Ibid.) The only issue a demurrer is
concerned with is whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of
action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
 
Where a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be
allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335,
348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to show the court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Ibid.;
Lewis v. YouTube, LLC (2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) However, “[i]f
there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause
of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).
 
Discussion
 
Standing
 
“Every action must be prosecuted in the name of the real
party in interest, except as otherwise provided by statute.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 367.) “Standing is related to the requirement contained in Code of Civil
Procedure section 367 …. The real party in interest is generally the person who
has the right to sue under the substantive law.” (River's Side at Washington
Square Homeowners Association v. Superior Court of Yolo County (2023) 88
Cal.App.5th 1209, 1225.) “A party who is not the real party in interest lacks
standing to sue because the claim belongs to someone else.” (Estate of
Bowles (2008) 169 Cal.App.4th 684, 690.)
 
Here, the real party in interest is not Plaintiff, but Plaintiff’s
friend who was the litigant in the Underlying Action. Plaintiff does not claim
to be a party to the Underlying Action. Thus, Plaintiff does not have standing
to litigate claims arising from rulings made against Plaintiff’s friend in the
Underlying Action.
 
Judicial Immunity
 
“It is well established judges are granted immunity from
civil suit in the exercise of their judicial functions. This rule applies even
where the judge's acts are alleged to have been done maliciously and corruptly.
The rule is based on a general principle of the highest importance to the
proper administration of justice that a judicial officer, in exercising the authority
vested in him, shall be free to act upon his own convictions, without
apprehension of personal consequence to himself.” (Frost v. Geernaert
(1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 1104, 1107 [internal citations and quotation marks
omitted].) Judicial immunity “applies to all judicial determinations, including
those rendered in excess of the judge's jurisdiction, no matter how erroneous
or even malicious or corrupt they may be.” 
(Howard v. Drapkin (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 843, 851.) “The judge is
immune unless he has acted in the clear absence of all jurisdiction.” (Ibid.
[internal citations and quotation marks omitted].)
 
The gravamen of Plaintiff’s Complaint is that Defendant,
while acting as the assigned judicial officer in the Underlying Action,
wrongfully prohibited Plaintiff from entering the courtroom during the
proceedings. Plaintiff alleges that this exclusion prevented Plaintiff from
offering evidence favorable to Plaintiff’s friend and resulted in adverse
rulings against Plaintiff’s friend. 
 
These claims fall squarely within the scope of judicial
immunity. Although the First Amendment creates a general right of public access
to court proceedings, the power to close hearings to the public under various
circumstances is contemplated by both statutory law and case law. (NBC
Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc. v. Superior Court (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178,
1213-1214; Code Civ. Proc. § 124, subd. (a).) Thus, Defendant’s decision to
exclude members of the public other than parties and witnesses cannot be said
to be “in the clear absence of all jurisdiction.” (Howard v. Drapkin, supra,
222 Cal.App.3d at 851.) Moreover, the scope of judicial immunity is broad, even
assuming that the judge made an error in his rulings.  (Frost v. Geernaert, supra 200
Cal.App.3d at pp. 1107-1108 [affirming trial court order sustaining demurrer
without leave to amend when plaintiff sued seven superior court judges because
of their rulings].)  Defendant has
judicial immunity against civil suit for those decisions.
 
The Court therefore sustains the demurrer without leave to
amend.
