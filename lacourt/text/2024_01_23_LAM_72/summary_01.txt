And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has tentatively ruled that CalPERS's motion for judgment on the pleadings will be continued and the action will be stayed pending the outcome of the Writ Proceedings. The Writ Proceedings are a review of the OAH decision, which found that CalPERS properly applied the MOU to put Plaintiffs in the 3% at 55 formula.

The Court has already sustained CalPERS's demurrer as to Plaintiffs' claims against CalPERS for breach of the MOU and breach of alleged individual employment agreements. The Court has also granted summary adjudication for the City.

Plaintiffs argue that the application of collateral estoppel to the ALJ's findings on the MOU is improper, but the Court finds that collateral estoppel can apply to individual issues, in the form of issue preclusion. The Court concludes that the ALJ's finding that CalPERS properly applied the MOU to put Plaintiffs in the 3% at 55 formula is preclusive.

The Court grants CalPERS's request to stay the action pending the outcome of the Writ Proceedings, citing the interest of judicial efficiency.
