And here is the English text summary:

The Judge issues a tentative ruling in this case, sustaining the demurrer filed by Defendant Gary C. Eto to the Complaint filed by Plaintiff Korie Schmidt. The Complaint alleges that Defendant, while acting as the presiding judge in the Underlying Action, wrongfully prohibited Plaintiff from entering the courtroom during a hearing, preventing Plaintiff from offering evidence favorable to their friend. The Judge finds that Plaintiff does not have standing to litigate claims arising from rulings made against their friend, as the real party in interest is the friend who was the litigant in the Underlying Action. Additionally, the Judge finds that Defendant has judicial immunity against civil suit for their decisions, as they acted within their jurisdiction and did not act in the clear absence of all jurisdiction. The Judge therefore sustains the demurrer without leave to amend.
