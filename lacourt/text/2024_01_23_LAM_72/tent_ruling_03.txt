 Hearing Date:  January 23, 2024
 Calendar Number:  5



 
 
 
Plaintiff Emanuele Giacometti (“Plaintiff”) moves to strike
the Answer filed by Defendants Giorgio Baldi, Inc. (“GBI”) and Elena Baldi
(collectively, “Defendants”).
 
The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s motion, which is untimely.  
 
Background
 
This action concerns Plaintiff’s employment with GBI.
 
Plaintiff filed this action against Defendants on June 13,
2023, raising claims for (1) failure to provide rest periods; (2) failure to
provide meal periods; (3) failure to pay wages due upon termination; (4)
conversion; (5) retaliation; and (6) unfair competition.
 
Defendants filed an Answer on September 14, 2023.
 
Plaintiff filed this motion on October 25, 2023. Defendants
filed an opposition. Plaintiff did not file a reply.
 

 
Legal Standard
 
The court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its
discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or
improper matter inserted in any pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436(a).) The
court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in
conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 436(b).) The grounds for a motion to strike are that the
pleading has irrelevant, false or improper matter, or has not been drawn or
filed in conformity with laws. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436.) The grounds for moving
to strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437.)
 
A demurrer to an answer may be brought on one of three
grounds: (1) the answer does not include facts sufficient to constitute a
defense; (2) uncertainty; and (3) the facts, as pleaded, are insufficient to
determine whether an alleged contract in the answer is written or
oral. Code Civ. Proc., § 430.20. 
 
Defenses should be relevant to a plaintiff’s legal claims
and averred carefully, and with as much detail as the facts constituting the
corresponding causes of action in the complaint.  FPI Development, Inc.
v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 384 (FPI Development). They
should not be proffered in the form of “terse legal conclusions.” (Ibid.)
 
Discussion
 
Timeliness
 
Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s motion is untimely.
Defendants filed the Answer on September 14, 2023. Plaintiff filed this motion
on October 25, 2023.
 
“Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading
may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof[.]”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (b)(1); see also City and County of San
Francisco v. Strahlendorf (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1911, 1913 [motion to strike
unavailable after time to file responsive pleading had passed].)
 
“A party who has filed a complaint or cross-complaint may,
within 10 days after service of the answer to his pleading, demur to the
answer.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.40, subd. (b).)
 
Here, Plaintiff’s motion to strike the Answer was filed far
more than ten days after the Answer. The motion to strike is therefore
time-barred.
