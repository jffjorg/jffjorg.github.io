The Judge has denied the County's motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication on all five causes of action. The Judge found that there are triable issues of fact regarding the County's knowledge of Marlene Tobin's harassing conduct and its failure to take reasonable steps to prevent it. The Judge also found that a reasonable jury could conclude that the County's failure to act was in part based on Valerie Kincaid's race.

The Judge's ruling is based on the evidence presented in the case, including testimony from Valerie Kincaid and other witnesses, as well as documents and records. The Judge found that the County's failure to move Marlene Tobin for over a year was reasonably likely to impair a reasonable employee's job performance or prospects for advancement or promotion.

The Judge also found that the County's failure to take action against Marlene Tobin's harassing conduct was a triable issue of fact, and that a reasonable jury could conclude that the County's failure to act was in part based on Valerie Kincaid's race.

The Judge's ruling denies the County's motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication on all five causes of action, and sets the case for trial.
