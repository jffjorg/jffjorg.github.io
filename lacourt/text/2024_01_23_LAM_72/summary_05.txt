**Case Information**

* Case Number: 23STCV24320
* Hearing Date: January 23, 2024
* Department: 72
* Court: Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles

**Parties**

* Plaintiff: Seung Hee Seo
* Defendants: Young Hee Choi, D.D.S., and Mee Dental Young Choi Group (collectively, "Defendants")

**Causes of Action**

* Dental Negligence (First Cause of Action)
* Lack of Informed Consent (Second Cause of Action)
* Negligent Misrepresentation (Third Cause of Action)
* Battery (Fourth Cause of Action)
* Unprofessional Conduct (Fifth Cause of Action)

**Ruling**

* Tentative Ruling:
	+ Sustains Defendants' demurrer with leave to amend with respect to Plaintiff's third cause of action for negligent misrepresentation.
	+ Sustains Defendants' demurrer without leave to amend with respect to Plaintiff's fifth cause of action for unprofessional conduct.
	+ Overtules Defendants' demurrer with respect to the remaining causes of action (dental negligence, lack of informed consent, and battery).
	+ Grants Defendants' motion to strike Plaintiff's prayer for attorney's fees.

**Facts**

* Plaintiff presented to Defendants for a routine teeth cleaning and scaling on July 8, 2022.
* Defendants advised Plaintiff that the extraction of six teeth was recommended.
* Plaintiff alleged that there was a heightened risk to extracting all six teeth at once, which Defendants did not inform her of.
* As a result, Plaintiff was unable to speak for approximately five months and lost roughly 20 pounds.

**Legal Standards**

* Demurrer: A demurrer tests the pleading alone, and not the evidence or facts alleged.
* Motion to Strike: The court may strike all or any part of a pleading that has irrelevant, false or improper matter, or has not been drawn or filed in conformity with laws.

**Discussion**

* The Court discusses each cause of action and the arguments presented by the parties.
* The Court finds that Plaintiff has plausibly alleged battery, but not unprofessional conduct, as the latter does not create a private right of action.

**Significant Statements**

* "A demurrer tests the pleading alone, and not the evidence or facts alleged."
* "A cause of action for lack of informed consent—which sounds in negligence—arises when the doctor performs a procedure without first adequately disclosing the risks and alternatives."
* "The battery theory should be reserved for those circumstances when a doctor performs an operation to which the patient has not consented."
