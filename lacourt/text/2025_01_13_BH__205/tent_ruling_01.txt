Background
 
On October 28,
2022, Plaintiff Guzy Regev (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendant
Niv Levy (“Defendant”) and Does 1-50, which asserted eight causes of action.  
On February 16,
2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against Defendant
alleging causes of action for: (1) intentional infliction of emotional
distress, (2) negligent infliction of emotional distress, (3) liability for
injuries to pets, (4) conversion, (5) breach of contract, (6) fraud, (7) breach
of fiduciary duties, and (8) unfair business practices. 
On June 16, 2023,
after hearing, the Court overruled in part and sustained in part Defendant’s
demurrer to the FAC with leave to amend, as well as granted in part and denied
in part Defendant’s motion to strike. (06/16/23 Minute Order at pp. 11-12.)  
On July 5, 2023,
Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) against Defendant alleging
causes of action for: (1) intentional infliction of emotional distress, (2)
negligent infliction of emotional distress, (3) liability for injuries to pets,
(4) conversion, (5) breach of contract, (6) fraud, (7) breach of fiduciary
duties, and (8) unfair business practices. 
On November 8,
2023, after hearing, the Court sustained in part and overruled in part
Defendant’s demurrer to the SAC. (11/08/23 Minute Order at p. 6.) 
On November 27,
2023, Plaintiff filed a Third Amended Complaint (“TAC”) against Defendant
alleging causes of action for: (1) intentional infliction of emotional
distress, (2) negligent infliction of emotional distress, (3) liability for
injuries to pets, (4) conversion, (5) breach of contract, (6) fraud, (7) breach
of fiduciary duties, and (8) unfair business practices.
On April 23, 2024,
after hearing, the Court sustained in part and overruled in part Defendant’s
demurrer to the TAC. (04/23/24 Minute Order at p. 5.) 
On May 3, 2024,
Defendant filed a motion to stay this action pending the resolution of
Defendant’s criminal case, to which Plaintiff filed an opposition and Defendant
replied. 
On May 15, 2024,
Defendant filed an ex parte application for a temporary stay of civil
proceedings, which was granted by the Court on May 17, 2024. (05/17/24 Minute
Order at p. 1.) The Court temporarily suspended this action until May 31, 2024.
(05/17/24 Minute Order at p. 1.)  
On May 31, 2024,
after hearing, the Court granted Defendant’s motion for stay of proceedings.
(05/31/24 Minute Order at p. 1.) The Court set a status conference for July 3,
2024. (05/31/24 Minute Order at p. 1.) 
At the July 3,
2024 status conference, the Court granted defense counsel’s request to continue
the stay. (07/03/24 Minute Order at p. 1.) The Court continued the status
conference to October 30, 2024. (07/03/24 Minute Order at p. 1.) 
On October 30,
2024, there were no appearances by or for either side, nor any communication
with the Court as to why there were no appearances. (10/30/24 Minute Order at
p. 1.) The Court set an OSC re: Sanctions for Failure to Appear for November
26, 2024. (10/30/24 Minute Order at p. 1.) The Court indicated that
“[s]anctions imposed may include the striking of the answer or dismissal of the
case.” (10/30/24 Minute Order at p. 1.) The Clerk’s office provided notice of
the October 30, 2024 order to counsel for the parties. (See 10/30/24
Certificate of Mailing.) 
On November 26,
2024, there were no appearances by or for either side, nor any communication
with the Court as to why there were no appearances. (11/26/24 Minute Order at
p. 1.) The parties also failed to submit a joint status report “as previously
ordered.” (11/26/24 Minute Order at p. 1.) There was also no response to the
order to show cause. (11/26/24 Minute Order at p. 1.) The Court ordered Plaintiff
to pay sanctions to the Court in the sum of $300.00 by December 16, 2024.
(11/26/24 Minute Order at p. 1.) The Court imposed sanctions on Defendant by
striking the answer.[1] (11/26/24 Minute Order at
p. 1.) The Court set an OSC re: Default for February 24, 2025. (11/26/24 Minute
Order at p. 1.) 
On December 13,
2024, Defendant filed and served the instant Motion to Vacate Order of November
26, 2024 and to Reinstate the Stay Order (the “Motion”). 
As of January 9,
2025, the Motion is unopposed. Any opposition to the Motion was required to
have been filed and served at least nine court days prior to the hearing. Code
Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b). 
Motion to Vacate Order
Standard
 
            “The court may,
upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal
representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken
against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.” Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b). “Application for this
relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed
to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall
be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the
judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding was taken.” Ibid.
            Code Civ. Proc. §
473(b) also contains a mandatory relief provision. SJP Limited Partnership
v. City of Los Angeles (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 511, 516. “[T]he court shall,
whenever an application for relief is made no more than six months after entry
of judgment, is in proper form, and is accompanied by an attorney’s sworn
affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect
vacate any (1) resulting default entered by the clerk against his or her
client, and which will result in entry of a default judgment; or (2) resulting
default judgment or dismissal entered against his or her client, unless the
court finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the
attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.” Ibid. “If the
prerequisites of the mandatory relief provision of section 473, subdivision (b)
exist, the trial court does not have discretion to refuse relief.” Ibid.  
Analysis
 
Evidence in Support of the Motion
            Defendant’s counsel, Mark Waecker
(“Waecker”), provides a declaration in support of the motion. Mr. Waecker
states that he encountered difficulties appearing at the October 30, 2204
hearing as he signed in and was waiting for the Court to call the case but his
“staff was unable to get through to the court” initially in order to “speak to
the clerk as to why this case was not called.” (Waecker Decl., ¶¶ 4, 5.)
Counsel’s staff was ultimately able to get through “and spoke to the clerk who
indicated the case had already been called and a minute order [would] be
mailed. [Counsel’s] staff explained to the clerk that [Mr. Waecker] had been
waiting since 8:30 am and that was no entry into the court for an appearance.”
(Waecker Decl., ¶ 5.) 
            As to his failure to appear at the
November 26, 2024 hearing, Mr. Waecker indicates that he was working on
Defendant’s criminal case and he noticed at approximately 9:00 a.m. that
morning “that there was some information that [he] would have to submit to the
criminal court concerning the case.” (Waecker Decl., ¶ 9.) He realized at 9:15
a.m. that he mis-calendared the hearing date in this action and he “immediately
stopped what [he] was doing and attempted to log on to the court without
success.” (Waecker Decl., ¶ 9.) Mr. Waecker states that he “asked [his] staff
to contact the courtroom to let them know that [he] was waiting for the court
appearance and was told that the case was already called and that [they] would
receive a minute order.” (Waecker Decl., ¶ 10.) 
            Counsel attests that the error was
the fault of his office and himself given that he is the attorney of record for
Defendant. (Waecker Decl., ¶ 12.) Such error occurred through inadvertence,
mistake, and excusable neglect as the hearing was mis-calendared. (Waecker
Decl., ¶ 12.) Defendant has a meritorious defense to the complaint and has a
substantial cross-complaint to be filed in this case. (Waecker Decl., ¶ 12.)
Defendant requests that the Court “vacate the [o]rder of November 26, 2024 and,
re-impose the [s]tay [o]rder as the criminal case is active and being
prosecuted” against Defendant. (Waecker Decl., ¶ 14.) 
            Defendant’s Motion is
Procedurally Deficient 
As an initial matter, the Court notes that Plaintiff
did not file an opposition. While
the moving party generally bears the initial burden of proof on its motion, and
lack of opposition will not automatically entitle the moving party to prevail
on its motion, a party’s failure to file an opposition can be considered a
concession that the motion is meritorious. See Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.
Initially, the Court notes that the stay order has not been
lifted by this Court. Thus, the Court opines why Defendant sought to reinstate
the stay in this action when such stay was never lifted. 
Here, Defendant has shown that the November 26, 2024 order
was entered due to the inadvertence of defense counsel in mis-calendaring the
hearing date. Defendant, however, did not file a proposed answer or other
pleading with the Motion. Thus, the Motion is procedurally improper, and the
Court cannot grant discretionary relief under CCP § 473(b). Defendant should
have attached a copy of the proposed answer and/or cross-complaint to the
declaration of Mr. Waecker. 
Furthermore, Defendant is not entitled to mandatory relief
under CCP § 473(b) as there neither been entry of judgment in this action nor
an entry of default or default judgment against Defendant. 
Conclusion
Based on the
foregoing, the Court DENIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE Defendant’s Motion to Vacate
Order of November 26, 2024 and to Reinstate the Stay Order.
