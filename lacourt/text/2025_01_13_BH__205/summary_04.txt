And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for a trial setting preference. The plaintiff, Parvin Mesri, is 82 years old and has poor health, including injuries suffered in an attack at Sterling International Towers. The plaintiff's counsel argues that the plaintiff's substantive right to a trial during her lifetime is at risk if she is not granted a trial preference. However, the judge finds that the plaintiff has not made a sufficient showing that a trial preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing her interest in the litigation. The judge notes that the plaintiff's counsel has not unequivocally stated that the plaintiff's health is such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing her interest in the litigation. Therefore, the motion is denied.
