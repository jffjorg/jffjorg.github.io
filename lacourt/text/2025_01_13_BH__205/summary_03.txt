And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Jonathan Shapiro, trustee of the Jonathan Shapiro and Helene Shapiro Trust, has applied for a default judgment against defendants Danyel Benhaghnazar and Stella Yaghoubzadeh. However, the court finds that the plaintiff has failed to meet the requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1800, which sets forth the requirements for default judgments. Specifically, the plaintiff failed to provide a brief summary of the case, declarations or admissible evidence to support the entry of a default judgment, interest computations, a memorandum of costs and disbursements, a declaration of nonmilitary status, and a request for court judgment on form CIV-100. As a result, the court denies the plaintiff's default judgment application without prejudice.
