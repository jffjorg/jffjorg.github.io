RULING
The motion is GRANTED. The court
orders that the attorney is relieved as counsel of record for defendant Rodnei
Dalilvalopes, effective upon the filing of the proofs of service of the signed
“Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel – Civil” (Judicial
Council form MC-053) upon the client.
BACKGROUND
On May 13, 2021, plaintiff Melinda
Lou Minkus filed a complaint against defendant Rodnei Da Silva Lopez for motor
vehicle negligence.  Plaintiff alleges
she was lawfully and properly crossing the north crosswalk of Monterey
Boulevard heading westbound on Pier Avenue in the City of Hermosa Beach,
California, when defendant negligently drove his motor vehicle into plaintiff’s
person. 
Between November 15 and November
17, 2021, plaintiff filed four motions to compel defendant’s further responses
to plaintiff’s form interrogatories, special interrogatories, requests for
admission, and request for production of documents. 
On February 25, 2022, the court
granted plaintiff’s four motions to compel further responses and ordered
defendant to serve supplemental responses to plaintiff’s written discovery
within ten days.   
On March 18, 2022, plaintiff filed
a motion to strike defendant’s answer and/or for the imposition of issue and
evidentiary sanctions for defendant’s failure to comply with the court’s
February 25, 2022 discovery order and for additional monetary sanctions against
defendant and his counsel of record. 
On April 20, 2022, the court
granted plaintiff’s motion for the issuance of monetary sanctions, awarding
$1,160.00 in sanctions against defendant (client only), and continued hearing
upon the remainder of plaintiff’s motion to May 24, 2022, ordering the parties
to file supplemental briefing. 
On May 24, 2022, the court granted
plaintiff’s motion to strike defendant’s answer, and effectively ordered
defendants 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, and 7th affirmative defenses within
defendant’s first amended answer be stricken as a form of issue and/or evidence
sanctions.  
On March 22, 2023, the court ordered
defendant’s answer stricken for failure to appear on November 4, 2022, failure
to attend MSC on January 27, 2023, and failure to comply with the court’s
mediation or two hour meet and confer and order of May 24, 2022.
On August 18, 2023, judgment was
entered in favor of plaintiff and against defendant in the amount of
$355,615.73.
On December 15, 2023, plaintiff
filed an acknowledgement of satisfaction of judgment – partial in the amount of
$15,000.
LEGAL STANDARD
The court has discretion to allow
an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided that
there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process
of justice.  See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904, 915; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal. App. 2d
398.
CRC Rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and motion to be directed to
the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general terms and
without compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship
why a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of
filing a consent under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the
Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil
form (MC-052)); (3) service of the notice of motion and motion and declaration
on all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order
relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)).
DISCUSSION
            Defendant Rodnei Dasilvalopes’
attorney Rory D. Leos, Esq. seeks to be relieved as counsel of defendant. 
            Counsel states in his declaration
that there has been an irreconcilable breakdown in the attorney client
relationship and communications.  Counsel
further states that defendant’s insurance carrier, GEICO, has tendered the
entirety of defendant’s insurance policy to plaintiff in exchange for a partial
satisfaction of judgment.  Counsel states
that plaintiff accepted the tender of defendant’s policy limits but has not
filed the partial satisfaction of judgment, which is required by defendant
prior to the withdrawal of counsel.
            The court notes that plaintiff filed
an acknowledgment of satisfaction of judgment – partial on December 15,
2023.   
The court finds that the attorney
submitted a declaration establishing that the service requirements of
California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362, have been satisfied.  The court also finds that the attorney has
shown sufficient reasons why the motion to be relieved as counsel should be
granted.
            The motion is GRANTED.
Moving counsel is ordered to give
notice of this ruling.
