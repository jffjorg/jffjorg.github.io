On August 24,
 2022, plaintiff Encore Automotive, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed
this action against defendant Robert Y. Lee (“Defendant”). On March 21,
2024, Plaintiff filed this motion for an order compelling Defendant’s responses
to First Set of Form Interrogatories. On June 26, 2024, Defendant filed a
“response” to this motion stating that responses without objections had been
served. On July 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply brief stating that Defendant
failed to serve responses to Form Interrogatory Nos. 50.2, 50.3, 50.4, 50.5,
and 50.6. In light of Defendant’s apparent failure to serve responses to these
interrogatories, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion in part and orders
Defendant to serve verified responses, without objections, to Form
Interrogatory Nos. 50.2, 50.3, 50.4, 50.5, and 50.6 from Plaintiff’s First Set
of Form Interrogatories, within 15 days of the date of this order. 
Moving party to give notice.
Dated
this 10th
day of July 2024
