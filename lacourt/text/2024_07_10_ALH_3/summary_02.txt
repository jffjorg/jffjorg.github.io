And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike or tax costs filed by the plaintiff, Odette Vivanco, against the defendants, Ottimo Resources Inc. and Pacific Clinics. The plaintiff has objected to the defendants' memorandum of costs, claiming that certain items are "unreasonably high" or unnecessary.

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to strike the entire memorandum of costs, finding that the premature filing of the memorandum of costs is a mere irregularity and does not constitute reversible error. The judge has also denied the plaintiff's motion to tax the court reporter fees, finding that the fees are reasonable and necessary to the conduct of the litigation.

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to tax certain items on the defendants' cost bill, including fees associated with filing the notice of remote appearance, which the judge finds were not "reasonably necessary" to the conduct of the litigation. The judge has also denied the plaintiff's motion to tax the cost of the court-ordered transcript and the electronic filing and service fees, finding that these items are reasonable and necessary to the conduct of the litigation.

The judge has ordered that the parties who intend to submit on the tentative must send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit, and that the opposing party may nevertheless appear at the hearing and argue the matter.
