Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Primary Partners Financial (PPF) to the Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint. The court has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, meaning that PPF's objections to the complaint have been upheld, but the Plaintiff has the opportunity to re-file the complaint to address the issues raised by PPF.

The court has found that the Plaintiff's breach of contract claim has stated sufficient facts, but is uncertain. The court has also found that the Plaintiff's negligent misrepresentation claim has stated sufficient facts, but is uncertain. However, the court has sustained the demurrer as to the Plaintiff's intentional misrepresentation claim, finding that the pleading falls short of the required standard.

The court has also sustained the demurrer as to the Plaintiff's conversion claim, finding that the conversion claim could be clarified with leave to amend. The court has noted that the issue of who is the hacker remains an issue, and that the complaint lacks clarity and is ambiguous.

The court has given the Plaintiff five court days to file a reply to PPF's demurrer, and the case is set for hearing on February 21, 2024.
