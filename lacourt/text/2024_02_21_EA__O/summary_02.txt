And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a demurrer filed by the defendant, which challenges the plaintiff's complaint. The judge notes that the defendant misstates the standard for some of the causes of action (COAs) at issue. Specifically, the defendant argues that specificity is required for COAs alleging breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation, but the judge finds that heightened pleading is not required for non-statutory or non-fraud COAs. The judge also notes that the defendant only discussed most of the COAs at issue, not all of them. The judge suggests that the plaintiff's complaint implies that the parties communicated via an external email address, PalomarasEscrow.com, and that further clarity may be needed to cure any ambiguity. The judge indicates that the defendant's demurrer will not be upheld to the extent that it relies on the incorrect pleading standard.
