[1] As observed by Plaintiff in opposition, PPF
misstates the standard for some of the COAs. For example, Defendant argues that
specificity is required for a breach of contract COA (Demurrer p. 13:25-26) and
negligent misrepresentation (Demurrer p. 14), but heightened pleading is not required
for non-statutory or non-fraud COAs. Thus, to the extent that Defendant relies
upon the incorrect pleading standard, it will not be discussed. 
 


[2] The demurrer states that Defendant demurs to the
entirety of the FAC, but only specifically discusses all COAs against it except
the negligence COA. 
 


[3] In Reply, Defendant contends that the FAC does not
mention that the parties corresponded “only” with the @PalomarasEscrow.com
account, as the opposition suggests. (Reply p. 6:1-5.) That is a fair point.
But while that exact allegation may not be pled, a holistic reading of
the FAC suggests that the PalomaresEscrow.com account was the email address
that the parties were (normally) communicating with. (See e.g., FAC ¶68 [“PPF had no reasonable
basis for believing the wire instructions were true as they contained a payee
that was not typical to similar transactions, and they were sent from
an external email address.”], emphasis added.) Should further clarity be
needed, this can be cured with leave to amend.
