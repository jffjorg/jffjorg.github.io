And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees in the reduced amount of $87,570. The plaintiff, Suits America, Inc., alleged that the defendants, Neda Menswear, Inc., Peyman Elyasi, and Leo Imaani, Inc., fraudulently induced the plaintiff into agreements for the sale of the plaintiff's products. The plaintiff found in favor and entered judgment against the defendants for $72,442.55 in damages. The plaintiff filed a motion for attorney's fees and the defendants did not file an opposition. The judge found that the plaintiff is the prevailing party and that the requested rate of $350 per hour is reasonable. However, the judge reduced the requested hours by 3.3 hours for work on the fee motion, which was deemed excessive. The judge granted the motion in the reduced amount of $87,570.
