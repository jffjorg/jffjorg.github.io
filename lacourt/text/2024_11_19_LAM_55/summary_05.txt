```

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's motion to set aside and vacate the defaults entered against Ismael Valdez and Ben Kean. The motion to set aside and vacate the defaults against NexGen and Service is vacated as moot because the requests for default were rejected by the Clerk's office and thus default has not been entered against those defendants. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's motion is timely and that the Plaintiff's attorney's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect was the cause of the default. The Judge exercises its inherent equitable power to void the entries of default for lack of due process and grants the Plaintiff's motion to set aside and vacate the defaults entered against Valdez and Kean.
