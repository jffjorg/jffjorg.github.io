And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Cross-Defendants' demurrer, which challenges the sufficiency of the Cross-Complaint's causes of action. The judge has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, meaning that the Cross-Complainants have 20 days to re-file the complaint with additional details.

The judge has also denied the motion to strike punitive damages as moot, since the demurrer has been sustained and the Cross-Complaint's causes of action for damages have been dismissed.

The judge's ruling is based on the allegation that the Cross-Complainants failed to plead sufficient facts to state a cause of action for fraud, fraudulent concealment, implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and declaratory relief. The judge has found that the Cross-Complainants have failed to allege damages beyond those that they may suffer if the Plaintiffs prevail on their claims, and that the damages are speculative.

The judge has also found that the Cross-Complainants have failed to plead sufficient facts to state a cause of action for fraudulent inducement, as the alleged omission is not one of fact but opinion and future intent.

The judge has granted the Cross-Defendants leave to amend the complaint to cure the defects identified in the demurrer.
