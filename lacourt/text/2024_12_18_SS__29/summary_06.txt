And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants three discovery motions filed by the defendant, Vardui Melkonian, against the plaintiff, Ilsa Miranda. The motions compel Ilsa Miranda to respond to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production. The defendant served Ilsa Miranda with these requests on March 22, 2024, but she has not responded. The court finds that the defendant has shown no need for further evidence and grants the motions. The court also denies the defendant's requests for sanctions in each motion, as Ilsa Miranda has not opposed the motions. The court orders Ilsa Miranda to serve written, code-compliant, verified responses to the defendant's discovery requests within 10 days of notice.
