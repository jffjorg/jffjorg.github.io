Xochitl Alvarez Espindola (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants
GetAround, Inc. (“Getaround”), Luke Mitchell Crawford (“Crawford”), and Does 1 through

On May 17, 2023, Plaintiff amended
the complaint to name Tatiana Ikonnikova (“Defendant”) as Doe 2. 
 
On January 22, 2024, the Court
denied Getaround’s motion for summary judgment.
 
On February 27, 2024, Defendant
and Crawford each filed an answer.
 
On August 29, 2024, Plaintiff
substituted in as her own counsel of record.
 
As it relates to the matter set for hearing on
December 18, 2024, Defendant filed this motion for summary judgment on August
7, 2024. No opposition has been filed. 
 
The motion was originally set for hearing on October
31, 2024, in Department 32. On October 28, 2024, the Court, on its own motion,
continued the hearing to December 5. Defendant gave notice to Plaintiff.
 
On November 22, 2024, the Court, on its own
motion, continued the hearing to December 18, 2024, in Department 32. The Clerk
gave notice.
 
On December 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed a two page
document described as “Submission of Evidence in Case.” No proof of service is
attached.
 
Legal
Standard
 
“The purpose
of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut
through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their
allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil
Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), “requires the trial judge to grant
summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably
deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or
evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of
the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the
issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether
there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the
pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67,
citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367,
381-382.)
 
As to each
cause of action as framed by the complaint, a defendant moving for summary
judgment or summary adjudication must satisfy the initial burden of proof by
presenting facts to show “that one or more elements of the cause of action ...
cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of
action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra,
25 Cal.4th at pp. 850-851; Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Once the defendant has met that burden, the burden
shifts to the plaintiff to show that a “triable issue of one or more material
facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp.
850-851.)
 
A plaintiff or
cross-complainant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication must
satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to show “that there is
no defense to a cause of action if that party has proved each element of the
cause of action entitling the party to judgment on the cause of action.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) Once the plaintiff or cross-complainant has
met that burden, the burden shift to the defendant or cross-defendant to show
that a “triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of
action or a defense thereto.” (Ibid.)
 
The party
opposing a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication may not simply
“rely upon the allegations or denials of its pleadings” but must instead “set
forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subds. (p)(1) & (p)(2). To establish a triable
issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial
responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151,
166.)
 
Courts
“liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary
judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore
v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
 
Discussion
 
Background
Facts
 
Plaintiff
was injured in an automobile accident with Luke Mitchell Crawford on January 15,
2021. (Undisputed Material Facts (“UMF”), No. 3.) The automobile Luke Mitchell Crawford was driving was a Ford F-150
(“Vehicle”) owned by Defendant. (UMF, No. 2.) Defendant signed up with
GetAround, a car sharing program; Luke Mitchell Combs rented Defendant’s
Vehicle through GetAround. (UMF, Nos. 1-3.)
 
Claim
Against Defendant
 
Plaintiff
asserts negligence, negligence per se, and statutory liability under Vehicle
Code section 17150-17159 claims against Defendant. 
 
The
basic elements of a cause of action for negligence are (1) the existence of a
legal duty; (2) breach of that duty; (3) causation; and (4) resulting damages.
(Brown v. USA Taekwondo (2021) 11 Cal.5th 204, 213; Kesner v.
Superior Court (2016) 1 Cal.5th 1132, 1158; Castellon v. U.S. Bancorp
(2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 994, 998.) “Every
owner of a motor vehicle is liable and responsible for death or injury to
person or property resulting from a negligent or wrongful act or omission in
the operation of the motor vehicle, in the business of the owner or otherwise,
by any person using or operating the same with the permission, express or
implied, of the owner.” (Vehicle Code § 17150.)
 
Defendant
states under oath that she was not involved in the accident as she was not
operating the vehicle and was not a passenger in the vehicle at the time of the
accident. (Ikonnikova Decl., ¶ 4.)
 
Further,
Defendant argues that under California Law, she is not responsible as the owner
of the vehicle. Insurance Code section 11580.24(d) states
 
“Notwithstanding
any other provision of law or any provision in a private passenger motor
vehicle owner’s automobile insurance policy, in the event of a loss or injury
that occurs during any time period when the vehicle is under the operation and
control of a person, other than the vehicle owner, pursuant to a personal
vehicle sharing program, or otherwise under the control of a personal vehicle
sharing program, the personal vehicle sharing program shall assume all
liability of the owner and shall be considered the owner of the vehicle for all
purposes. Nothing in this section limits the liability of the personal vehicle
sharing program for its acts or omissions that result in injury to any persons
as a result of the use or operation of a personal vehicle sharing program.”
 
It is
undisputed that GetAround is a ride-sharing platform under Insurance Code
section 11580.240(b)(2) as it is an entity which provides the means of “use of
private passenger motor vehicles by persons other than the vehicle’s owner.” (Morris
Decl. ¶ 2.) Defendant signed up to rent the Vehicle with GetAround on December
14, 2017; the Vehicle was rented by GetAround User Luke Mitchell Crawford on
January 15, 2021. (Ikonnikova Decl., ¶¶ 2, 3; Morris Decl., ¶¶ 4, 5.)
 
The
Court finds Defendant has met her burden as the party moving for summary
judgment.  She has shown that she was not
the driver of the vehicle, that she was not negligent in connection with the
accident, and that, as a matter of law, she is not statutorily liable as the
owner under California law.
 
This
shifts the burden to Plaintiff to show that there are one or more triable
issues of fact with regard to the causes of action in the complaint against
Defendant.
 
Plaintiff
has not done so. 
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s motion for summary judgment is granted. 
 
Conclusion
 
The
Court GRANTS the motion for summary judgment filed by Defendant Tatiana
Ikonnikova. 
 
Moving
Party is to give notice.
