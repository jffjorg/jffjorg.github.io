  Case Number:  20STCV24465    Hearing Date:   December 18, 2024    Dept:  29 Wilson v.
Molina
20STCV24465
Petition for Approval of Minor’s Compromise for Maverick Louie Wilson and
Jordan Rickey Wilson
 
Tentative 
 
The Court excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and the
guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by telephone or video conference
call.  
 
The Court previously reviewed the
petitions filed on October 9, 2024 and noted several issues that needed to be
addressed in its November 6, 2024 Minute Order. 
 
Petitioner filed new petitions on
November 18, 2024.  Several issues remain
that must be addressed.
 
First, on both petitions, Item 11
fails to include the other Claimant’s settlement. (See Items 11b(5).) 
 
Second, no attachment 11b(6) has
been filed to describe the apportionment of the settlement.
 
Third, on both petitions, Item 14b states
that Petitioner has paid $3,687.50 in expenses. The included invoices are
confusing as they add up to $8,250.00, more than the amount being claimed as
paid by Petitioner for both petitions.
 
Fourth, on both proposed orders on
form MC-351, item 8a(2) is confusing based on the unknown amount of expenses
paid by Petitioner.
Last, on both proposed
orders on form MC-355, item 4 has what appears to be
a small error in the amount to be deposited; the amount listed is $5,399.60
instead of $5,399.27.
Accordingly,
the Court CONTINUES the hearing regarding Petition for Approval of Minor’s
Compromise set from 12/18/2024 to __/__/2024 at 1:30 PM in DEPT. 29 at SPRING
STREET COURTHOUSE.
