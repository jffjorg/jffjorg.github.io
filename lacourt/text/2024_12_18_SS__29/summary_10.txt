And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant's motion for summary judgment, but granted it in part as to the Tenth Affirmative Defense. The judge has also denied Defendant's motion for summary adjudication as to the Eighth Affirmative Defense.

The judge found that the liability waiver in the membership agreement is enforceable as to claims for ordinary negligence, but not as to claims for gross negligence. The judge concluded that there was a triable issue as to whether Defendant was grossly negligent, based on evidence that Defendant was put on notice several times that the machine which caused Plaintiff's injury was faulty and failed to take protective measures to keep patrons from using the machine.

The judge also denied Defendant's motion for summary judgment on the ground that there were triable issues as to whether Defendant's conduct constituted gross negligence. The judge concluded that a trier of fact could reasonably find that Defendant was grossly negligent, but also noted that the trier of fact could also reasonably find the opposite.
