Background
 
On July
13, 2022, Carmit Burstyn (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Bed Bath &
Beyond and Does 1 through 30 for general negligence and premises liability
arising out of an incident on October 30, 2021, in which Plaintiff was
allegedly struck by a metal rod.
 
On
September 16, 2022, Bed Bath & Beyond, Inc. (“BBB”) filed an answer. On May
30, 2023, BBB filed notice of stay of proceedings due to bankruptcy.
 
On
November 20, 2023, Plaintiff amended the complaint to name Studio City East
93K, LLC (“Studio”) as Doe 1.
 
On March
8, 2024, Studio filed an answer and a cross-complaint against BBB, Bed ‘N Bath
O Studio City, Inc, and Roes 1 through 50.
 
On
September 10, 2024, the Court granted Studio’s motions to compel
Plaintiff provide verified responses to interrogatories and document requests
and granted Studio’s motion for a deemed-admitted order as to requests for
admission.  The Court also ordered Plaintiff to pay monetary
sanctions to Studio.
 
On
October 17, 2024, Studio filed this motion for terminating sanctions. On
October 28, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition.
On
October 18, 2024, on Studio’s ex parte application, the Court continued the

on the new trial date.
 
This motion was
initially set for hearing on December 2. 
At the hearing, the Court heard from counsel, made an order for
supplemental briefing, and continued the hearing to December 18.
 
Plaintiff filed a
supplemental opposition on December 10. 
Studio filed a supplemental reply on December 13.
 
Legal Standard
When a plaintiff fails to obey an order compelling answers to
interrogatories, “the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).  In lieu
of or in addition to, that sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction
under Chapter 7.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)
When a plaintiff fails to obey an order compelling responses to
requests for production, “the court may make those orders that are just,
including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010).  In lieu of or in addition to, that sanction, the court
may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, section 2023.030 provides
for monetary, evidence, issue, and terminating sanctions for any “misuse of the
discovery process,” “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter governing any
particular discovery method or any other provision of this title.”  A
“misuse of the discovery process” is defined to include (among other things)
failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery; making,
without substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery;
making an evasive response to a discovery request; disobeying a court order to
provide discovery; and making or opposing, unsuccessfully, a motion to compel
without substantial justification. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds.
(d)-(h).)
The Civil Discovery Act provides for an escalating and
“incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions
and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Lopez v. Watchtower
Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th
566, 604.) Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to and commensurate
with the misconduct, and they “should not exceed that which is required to
protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Doppes
v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) “If a lesser
sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted: continuing
misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until
the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.” (Ibid.; see also,
e.g., Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th
262, 279-280.) 
Terminating sanctions should be used sparingly. (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992; R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999)
75 Cal. App. 4th 486, 496.) “Although in extreme cases a court has the
authority to order a terminating sanction as a first measure, a terminating
sanction should generally not be imposed until the court has attempted less
severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly
shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective.” (Lopez, supra, 246 Cal.App.4th
at p. 604.)  But where discovery violations are “willful,
preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe
sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial
court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) Repeated and willful violations of discovery orders
that prejudice the opposing party may warrant a terminating sanction. (Creed-21
v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702; Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390; Biles
v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327; Lang v.
Hachman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246; Collisson X Kaplan
v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622.)
The
primary purpose of discovery sanctions is to obtain compliance with the Civil
Discovery Act and the Court’s orders. It is not to punish. (Newland v.
Super. Ct. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613; Ghanooni v. Super
Shuttle of Los Angeles (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) A discovery
sanction should not create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a
better position than it would have been if the opposing party had simply
complied with its obligations under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery
Act. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1164,
1194; see also 2 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure
Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023), ¶¶ 8:2214-2220.)
A
“terminating sanction issued solely because of a failure to pay a monetary
discovery sanction is never justified.” 
(Newland, supra, 40 Cal.App.4th at p. 615.) 
Discussion
On
September 10, 2024, the Court (among other things) ordered Plaintiff to respond
to the interrogatories and document requests propounded by Studio within 15
days of notice.  Studio gave notice on September
12.  Plaintiff has not complied with the Court’s
Order.  (Arquell Decl., ¶ 13.)
Studio
seeks terminating sanctions for Plaintiff’s misuse of the discovery process and
failure to comply with the Court’s Order made on September 10, 2024. 
According
to Plaintiff’s counsel, responses were prepared and finalized on September 26,
2024, but due to an error in the office the responses were not emailed to
Studio.  (Dufour Decl., ¶¶ 7, 9.)  The responses were sent on December 3, one
day after the first hearing on this motion. 
(Id., ¶¶ 9-10 & Exh. D.)
For terminating sanctions, a party must
present evidence of repeated and willful misuse of the discovery process, as
well as evidence that less severe sanctions have
not (or likely will not) lead to compliance with the discovery rules.  Studio has not, on this record at this time,
made such a showing.  There has not been a showing of a history or pattern of
willful abuse or repeated violations that have not been (or cannot be) cured by
lesser sanctions. 
Moreover, a discovery sanction should not
create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a better position than it
would have been if the opposing party had simply complied with its obligations
under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery Act. (Rutledge, supra, 238
Cal.App.4th at p. 1194.)  
Here, at this time, the Court finds that a
terminating sanction or other non-monetary sanction would create such a
windfall for Studio.
Accordingly, the request for terminating
sanctions, evidence sanctions, and/or issue sanctions is denied.
In the supplemental reply, Studio requests
monetary sanctions. But monetary sanctions were not requested in the notice of
motion.  The Court cannot grant relief that
is not requested in the notice of motion.
Conclusion
The Court DENIES the motion of Defendant Studio
City East 93K, LLC for sanctions.
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice.
