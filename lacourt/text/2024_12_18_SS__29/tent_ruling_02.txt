Legal Standard
Terminating Sanctions
When a plaintiff fails to obey an order compelling answers to
interrogatories, “the court may make those orders that
are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction,
or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010).  In lieu of or in addition to,
that sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)
When a plaintiff fails to obey an order compelling responses to
requests for production, “the court may
make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction,
an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).  In lieu of or in
addition to, that sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, section 2023.030 provides
for monetary, evidence, issue, and terminating sanctions for any “misuse of the
discovery process,” “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter governing any
particular discovery method or any other provision of this title.”  A “misuse of
the discovery process” is defined to include (among other things) failing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery; making, without
substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an
evasive response to a discovery request; disobeying a court order to provide
discovery; and making or opposing, unsuccessfully, a motion to compel without
substantial justification. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d)-(h).)
The Civil Discovery Act provides for an escalating and
“incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions
and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Lopez v. Watchtower
Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th
566, 604.) Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to and commensurate
with the misconduct, and they “should not exceed that which is required to
protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Doppes
v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) “If a lesser
sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted: continuing
misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until
the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.” (Ibid.; see also,
e.g., Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th
262, 279-280.) 
Terminating sanctions should be used sparingly. (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992; R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999)
75 Cal. App. 4th 486, 496.) “Although in extreme cases a court has the
authority to order a terminating sanction as a first measure, a terminating
sanction should generally not be imposed until the court has attempted less
severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly
shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective.” (Lopez, supra, 246 Cal.App.4th
at p. 604.)  But where discovery violations are “willful,
preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe
sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial
court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) Repeated and willful violations of discovery orders
that prejudice the opposing party may warrant a terminating sanction. (Creed-21
v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702; Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390; Biles
v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327; Lang v.
Hachman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246; Collisson X Kaplan
v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622.)
The
primary purpose of discovery sanctions is to obtain compliance with the Civil
Discovery Act and the Court’s orders. It is not to punish. (Newland v.
Super. Ct. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613; Ghanooni v. Super
Shuttle of Los Angeles (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) A discovery
sanction should not create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a
better position than it would have been if the opposing party had simply
complied with its obligations under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery
Act. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1164,
1194; see also 2 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure
Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023), ¶¶ 8:2214-2220.)
It is “never justified” for a court to impose a terminating
sanction “solely because of a failure to pay a monetary discovery sanction.”  (Newland, supra, 40 Cal.App.4th at p.
615.)
Motions to Compel Further Responses to Interrogatories
“On receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding
party may move for an order compelling a further response if the propounding
party deems that any of the following apply: (1) An answer to a particular
interrogatory is evasive or incomplete. (2) An exercise of the option to
produce documents under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required
specification of those documents is inadequate. (3) An objection to an
interrogatory is without merit or too general.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a).)
Notice of a motion to compel further responses must be given
“within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental
verified response, or on or before any specific later date to which the
propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing.” (Id.,
subd. (c).)
A motion to compel further responses must be accompanied by a meet-and-confer
declaration and a separate statement or, in the discretion of the Court, a
“concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute.” (Id.,
subd. (b)(1) & (b)(2); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345.)
“The court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel a further response to interrogatories, unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (d).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of
Civil Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part,
that the court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that any person
“engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that
conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees,
incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” A “misuse of the discovery
process” includes (among other things) failing to respond or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery; making, without substantial justification, an
unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an evasive response to a discovery
request; disobeying a court order to provide discovery; and making or opposing,
unsuccessfully, a motion to compel without substantial justification. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d)-(h).) 
Discussion
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form
Interrogatories
City
served Plaintiff with discovery, including Form Interrogatories (Set One), on
June 2, 2022.  (Ferrante-Alan Decl., ¶
4.)  After numerous delays, a court
order, and further delays, Plaintiff served verified responses on January 26,
2024.  (Id., ¶ 15.)  
City
contends that the responses are not code compliant.  (Id., ¶ 16 & Exh. I.)  An informal discovery conference (IDC) was
scheduled for October 2, 2024, but Plaintiff did not appear.
On
November 14, 2024, City filed this motion. 
The only Form Interrogatory at issue is No. 12.4, which asks the
responding party whether there are any “photographs, films, or videotapes
depicting any place, object, or individual concerning the incident or plaintiff’s
injuries,” and, if so, requires the responding party to provide certain
additional information in response to subparts (a) through (e) of the
interrogatory.
In
response, Plaintiff has acknowledged that there are photographs of the scene of
the accident and has produced them. 
Plaintiff has not, however, provided the information required to respond
to subparts (a) through (e) of Form Interrogatory 12.4.
Accordingly,
the motion to compel is granted.
The
request for sanctions is also granted. 
Plaintiff has unsuccessfully opposed a motion
to compel a further response to interrogatories, Plaintiff has not acted with substantial
justification, and there are no other circumstances that make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.
The Court sets sanctions on this motion in the
amount of $1,000, based on four hours of attorney time multiplied by counsel’s
reasonable billing rate of $250 per hour. 
(See Ferrante-Alan Decl., ¶ 22.)
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special
Interrogatories
City
served Plaintiff with discovery, including Special Interrogatories (Set One),
on June 2, 2022.  (Ferrante-Alan Decl., ¶
4.)  After numerous delays, a court
order, and further delays, Plaintiff served verified responses on January 26,
2024.  (Id., ¶ 15.)  
City
contends that the responses are not code compliant.  (Id., ¶ 16 & Exh. I.)  An informal discovery conference (IDC) was
scheduled for October 2, 2024, but Plaintiff did not appear.
On
November 14, 2024, City filed this motion. 
City seeks an order compelling Plaintiff to provide further responses to
Special Interrogatories Nos. 11, 15, 30-38, 48-52, 59-61, and 82.
On
December 5, 2024, Plaintiff served verified further responses.  (Hakopian Decl., ¶ 5 & Exh. C.)  City no longer seeks an order to compel further
responses to Special Interrogatories Nos. 15, 48, and 82.  (Id., ¶ 6.)
The
Court has reviewed the further responses served on December 5, 2024 and rules
as follows:
The motion
to compel further responses is GRANTED as to Special Interrogatories Nos. 11,
35-38, 49-52, and 59-61 is granted. 
These responses are not code compliant.
The
motion to compel further responses is DENIED as to Special Interrogatories Nos.
30-34.  The response are code compliant.
The
request for sanctions is also granted. 
Plaintiff has largely opposed a
motion to compel a further response to interrogatories unsuccessfully (although
not entirely), Plaintiff has not acted with substantial justification, and
there are no other circumstances that make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.
The Court sets sanctions on this motion in the
amount of $750, based on three hours of attorney time multiplied by counsel’s
reasonable billing rate of $250 per hour. 
(See Ferrante-Alan Decl., ¶ 22.)
Motion for Terminating, Issue, and/or Monetary Sanctions
On March
15, 2023, the Court granted City’s motion to compel Plaintiff to provide
initial responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests
for production.  The Court ordered
Plaintiff to provide with responses within 30 days.  The Court also ordered Plaintiff and counsel,
jointly and severally, to pay $450 in sanctions.
Plaintiff
did not comply with this order. 
(Ferrante-Alan Decl., ¶ 13.)  On
July 20, 2023, Plaintiff served unverified, incomplete responses.  (Id., ¶ 15.)
On
January 26, 2024, Plaintiff served verified further response to the form
interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production.  (Id., ¶ 20.) 
City contends that these responses are not code compliant.  (See id., ¶ 21.)
On April
26, 2024, Plaintiff served another round of unverified, incomplete response.  (Id., ¶ 22.)
City
previously moved for terminating, issue, evidence, and/or monetary sanctions
relating to these same discovery requests on June 7, 2023.  The hearing on the motion was initially set
for July 25, continued to August 29, and then denied.
City now
brings a second motion for terminating, issue, and/or monetary sanctions, based
on a combination of Plaintiff’s past conduct and Plaintiff’s continuing failure
to comply with her obligations under the orders of the Court as well as under
the Civil Discovery Act.
For terminating sanctions, a party must
present evidence of repeated and willful misuse of the discovery process, as
well as evidence that less severe sanctions have
not (or likely will not) lead to compliance with the discovery rules.  City has not, on this record at this time,
made such a showing.  There has not been a showing of a history or pattern of
willful abuse or repeated violations that have not been (or cannot be) cured by
lesser sanctions. 
Moreover, a discovery sanction should not
create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a better position than it
would have been if the opposing party had simply complied with its obligations
under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery Act. (Rutledge, supra, 238
Cal.App.4th at p. 1194.)  
Here, at this time, a terminating sanction or
an issue sanction would create such a windfall for City.  City would be far better off if the requested
sanctions were granted than if Plaintiff had complied with her obligations. 
The Court, above, has granted two motions to
compel and imposed additional significant monetary sanctions on Plaintiff.  The request for terminating sanctions, issue
sanctions, or even further monetary sanctions is not supported by the record
and is denied.  
Of course, if Plaintiff continues to fail to
comply with her obligations under the Civil Discovery act and this Court’s
orders, City may file a new motion and seek further sanctions, including
nonmonetary sanctions.  And if three awards
of monetary sanctions (one in 2023 and two in this order) are not sufficient to
bring Plaintiff into compliance with her obligations to respond to discovery,
the Court will give strong consideration to granting City’s request for serious
nonmonetary sanctions.
