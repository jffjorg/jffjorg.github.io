 Case Number:  22STCV23537    Hearing Date:   December 18, 2024    Dept:  29 Chan v. Lyft,
Inc.
22STCV23537


Tentative
Defendant Lyft,
Inc. (“Defendant”) reserved a hearing on December 18, 2024, for one motion to
deem one of the plaintiffs to have admitted the truth of the matters specified
in requests for admission.
Defendant filed
two motions for deemed-admitted orders and two additional motions to compel,
all set for hearing on December 18, 2024.
Defendant has
not properly reserved a hearing date in this Court.  Accordingly, all four motions set for hearing
on this date are placed off calendar.  
This ruling is
without prejudice.  Defendant may refile
the motions and, if Defendant does so, Defendant must properly reserve a
hearing on each motion.
Moving party is
ordered to give notice.
