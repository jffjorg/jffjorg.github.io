of Los Angeles
22STCV21071
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Compliance with Notice of Site Inspection
 
Tentative
 
The motion is denied
without prejudice on procedural grounds.
 
Background
 
On June 28,
2022, Richard Harrison (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against City of Los
Angeles, Los Angeles World Airports (collectively “Defendants”), and Does 1
through 50, asserting a cause of action for premises liability arising out of
trip and fall occurring on August 13, 2021.
 
On May 1, 2023,
Defendants filed an answer.
 
On November 14, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion to compel
compliance with a demand for site inspection. 
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal
Standard
 
“Any party may obtain discovery … by inspecting …
documents, tangible things, land or other property … in the possession,
custody, or control of any other party to the action. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.010, subd. (a).) “A party may demand that any other party allow the party
making the demand, or someone acting on the demanding party’s behalf, to enter
on any land or other property that is in the possession, custody, or control of
the party on whom the demand is made, and to inspect and to measure, survey, photograph,
test, or sample the land or other property, or any designated object or
operation on it.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.010, subd. (d).)
The Civil Discovery Act contemplates three separate
types of motions with regard to requests for production or inspection.
First, a party
must respond to a request for inspection or production within 30 days after
service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.(a).) If a party does not provide a
timely written response, the requesting party may move for an order under Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 compelling an initial response to the request.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a
motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and confer efforts are
required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.
v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must
a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
Second, under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2031.310, when a response to a demand for inspection or
production is received, “the demanding party may move for an order compelling
further response to the demand if the demanding party deems that any of the
following apply: (1) A statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete. (2)
A representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive. (3)
An objection in the response is without merit or too general.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a).)
Notice of a motion to
compel further responses must be given “within 45 days of the service of the
verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any
specific later date to which the propounding party and the responding party have
agreed in writing.” (Id., subd. (c).)
A
motion to compel further responses must set forth specific facts showing good
cause for the discovery and must be accompanied by a meet-and-confer
declaration and a separate statement or, in the discretion of the Court, a
“concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute.” (Id.,
subd. (b)(1)-(3); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345.)
Third, and finally, under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2031.320, when a party serves a response stating that it will comply
with a request for an inspection or production, but then fails to permit the
inspection or make the production, “the demanding party may move for an order
compelling compliance.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.320, subd. (a).)
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff seeks an order requiring Defendants
to comply with his notice of site inspection.
 
The Court must deny this motion as procedurally
premature.
 
Plaintiff has served a site inspection
demand, an amended site inspection demand, a second amended site inspection
demand, and a third amended site inspection demand.  (Fantasia Decl., ¶ 3 & Exhs. 5, 7, 10, 15.)  But there is no indication that Defendants
ever served a respond to any of these site inspection demands.
When there has been no response to a
site inspection demand, Plaintiff’s remedy is under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2031.300: Plaintiff may seek an order compelling Defendants to serve a
written response to the demand.
 
Plaintiff, however, seeks an order
requiring Defendants to comply with the notice. 
That remedy is not available to Plaintiff in this procedural
posture.  Indeed, an order requiring
compliance is available only under section 2031.320, and only after (1)
Defendants have responded to the demand with a statement of compliance; and (2)
Defendants have failed to permit the inspection in accordance with the
statement of compliance.  (See Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.320, subd. (a).)
 
Accordingly, the motion is denied
without prejudice on procedural grounds.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court DENIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE Plaintiff’s motion
to compel Defendants to comply with the notice of site inspection. 
 
Moving party is
ORDERED to give notice.
