Background
On

City of Los Angeles (“City”) and Does 1 through 10. On May 8, 2023, Plaintiff
filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”). 
 
On March
13, 2024, Defendant filed an answer to the FAC. Defendant also filed a cross-complaint
against Roes 1 through10.
 
On November 19,
2024, City filed this motion for terminating sanctions and/or monetary
sanctions. Later that same day, on November 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed an
opposition. No reply has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
When a plaintiff fails to obey an order compelling answers to
interrogatories, “the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).  In lieu
of or in addition to, that sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction
under Chapter 7.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)
When a plaintiff fails to obey an order compelling responses to
requests for production, “the court may make those orders that are just,
including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010).  In lieu of or in addition to, that sanction, the court
may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, section 2023.030 provides
for monetary, evidence, issue, and terminating sanctions for any “misuse of the
discovery process,” “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter governing any
particular discovery method or any other provision of this title.”  A
“misuse of the discovery process” is defined to include (among other things)
failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery; making,
without substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery;
making an evasive response to a discovery request; disobeying a court order to
provide discovery; and making or opposing, unsuccessfully, a motion to compel
without substantial justification. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds.
(d)-(h).)
The Civil Discovery Act provides for an escalating and
“incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions
and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Lopez v. Watchtower
Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th
566, 604.) Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to and commensurate
with the misconduct, and they “should not exceed that which is required to
protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Doppes
v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) “If a lesser
sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted: continuing
misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until
the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.” (Ibid.; see also,
e.g., Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th
262, 279-280.) 
Terminating sanctions should be used sparingly. (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992; R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999)
75 Cal. App. 4th 486, 496.) “Although in extreme cases a court has the
authority to order a terminating sanction as a first measure, a terminating
sanction should generally not be imposed until the court has attempted less
severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly
shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective.” (Lopez, supra, 246 Cal.App.4th
at p. 604.)  But where discovery violations are “willful,
preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe
sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial
court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) Repeated and willful violations of discovery orders
that prejudice the opposing party may warrant a terminating sanction. (Creed-21
v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702; Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390; Biles
v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327; Lang v.
Hachman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246; Collisson X Kaplan
v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622.)
The
primary purpose of discovery sanctions is to obtain compliance with the Civil
Discovery Act and the Court’s orders. It is not to punish. (Newland v.
Super. Ct. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613; Ghanooni v. Super
Shuttle of Los Angeles (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) A discovery
sanction should not create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a
better position than it would have been if the opposing party had simply
complied with its obligations under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery
Act. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1164,
1194; see also 2 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure
Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023), ¶¶ 8:2214-2220.)
A
“terminating sanction issued solely because of a failure to pay a monetary
discovery sanction is never justified.” 
(Newland, supra, 40 Cal.App.4th at p. 615.) 
Discussion
On
September 18, 2024, this Court granted three discovery motions filed by City
and ordered Plaintiff to respond to Form Interrogatories (Set One), Special
Interrogatories (Set One), and Requests for Production (Set One) within 21 days
of service.  The Court also ordered
Plaintiff to pay monetary sanctions to City. 

Plaintiff
did not comply with the Court’s order. 
(Bona Decl., ¶¶ 7-8.)  
The day
that this motion was filed, Plaintiff belatedly served the required discovery
responses.  (Yeager Decl., ¶ 2 & Exh.
1.)
City
seeks terminating sanctions for Plaintiff’s failure to follow the Court’s September
18, 2024 order and failure to provide code-compliant, verified responses to
written discovery. 
For terminating sanctions, a party must
present evidence of repeated and willful misuse of the discovery process, as
well as evidence that less severe sanctions have
not (or likely will not) lead to compliance with the discovery rules.  City has not, on this record at this time,
made such a showing.  There has not been a showing of a history or pattern of
willful abuse or repeated violations that have not been (or cannot be) cured by
lesser sanctions. 
Moreover, a discovery sanction should not
create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a better position than it
would have been if the opposing party had simply complied with its obligations
under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery Act. (Rutledge, supra, 238
Cal.App.4th at p. 1194.)  
Here, at this time, the Court finds that a
terminating sanction would create such a windfall for City
City also requests monetary sanctions of
$500. 
That request is granted.  Plaintiff has engaged in a misuse of the
discovery process by failing to comply her obligations under the Civil
Discovery Act and failing to obey a Court Order regarding discovery.  The Court sets sanctions in the amount
requested by City, based on two hours of attorney work multiplied by a
reasonable billing rate of $250 per hour.
Conclusion
The Court DENIES City’s request for terminating
sanctions.
The Court GRANTS City’s request for
additional monetary sanctions.
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff Elizabeth Parrott and
her attorney of record, Kenneth C. Yeager, jointly and severally, to pay monetary
sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act in the amount of $500.00 to Defendant
City of Los Angeles (through counsel) within 30 days of notice.
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice.
