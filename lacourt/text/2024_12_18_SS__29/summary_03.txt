And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for summary judgment filed by Defendant Tatiana Ikonnikova. The motion was filed in response to a complaint filed by Plaintiff Xochitl Alvarez Espindola, alleging negligence, negligence per se, and statutory liability. The accident occurred on January 15, 2021, when Plaintiff was injured in a vehicle accident with Luke Mitchell Crawford, who was driving a Ford F-150 owned by Defendant. Defendant argues that she is not responsible for the accident as she was not involved in the accident and was not the owner of the vehicle at the time of the accident. The judge finds that Defendant has met her burden and has shown that she was not the driver of the vehicle, that she was not negligent in connection with the accident, and that, as a matter of law, she is not statutorily liable as the owner under California law. The judge concludes that Defendant's motion for summary judgment is granted, and the parties are ordered to provide notice accordingly.
