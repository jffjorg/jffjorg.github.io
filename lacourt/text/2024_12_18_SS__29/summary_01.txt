And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Wilson v. Molina, which concerns a petition for approval of a minor's compromise. The court has determined that several issues need to be addressed before the petition can be approved. These issues include incomplete information in the petition, confusing invoices, and errors in the proposed orders. As a result, the court has continued the hearing to a later date to allow for the resolution of these issues. The court has also excused the personal appearance of the claimant and the guardian ad litem, allowing counsel to appear by telephone or video conference call instead.
