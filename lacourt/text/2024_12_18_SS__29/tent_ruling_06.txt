Background
On May 17, 2022, Ilsa Miranda, Bryan Miranda,
and Erick Ojeda (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint against Vardui
Melkonian (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 10 for motor vehicle negligence
arising out of an automobile accident occurring on December 19, 2019. 
Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint on
July 17, 2023. 
On October 4, 2023, Defendant filed an
answer.
In December 2023 and February 2024,
Plaintiffs amended their complaint to name Wanda Ivascyn as Doe 1 and John
Ivascyn as Doe 2. 
On March 22, 2024, Wanda and John Ivascyn
filed an answer and cross-complaint against Defendant. The cross-complaint was
dismissed on May 1, 2024.
On October 22 and November 22, 2024, the
Court granted the motion of Plaintiffs’ former counsel to be relieved.
Before the Court and set for hearing on
December 18, 2024 are three discovery motions filed by Defendant on November 12,
2024: (1) Motion to Compel Plaintiff Ilsa Miranda to
Respond to Form Interrogatories (Set One); (2) Motion to Compel Plaintiff
Ilsa Miranda to Respond to Special Interrogatories
(Set One); and (3) Motion to Compel Plaintiff Ilsa
Miranda to Respond to Requests for Production (Set One).  Defendant also seeks sanctions in each
motion.
No opposition has been filed.
Legal Standard
 
A party must
respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed does not provide a
timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and confer efforts
are required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.
Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a
separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party
moves to compel initial responses to interrogatories, “the court shall impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (c).)
A party must
respond to requests for production of documents within 30 days after service.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for
production of documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the
requesting party may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (Id.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300;
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In
addition, a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When a party
moves to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (c).) 
In Chapter 7 of
the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision
(d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to
respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd. (a).)
Discussion
On March 22, 2024, Defendant served Ilsa
Miranda with Form Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One,
and Demand for Inspection and Production of Documents, Set One. (Galang Decls.,
¶ 2; Exh. A.) Plaintiff Ilsa Miranda has not responded. (Id., ¶ 4.)
 
Defendant need show nothing more.
 
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s motions
to compel Plaintiff Ilsa Miranda to respond to Form Interrogatories, Set One,
Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Demand for Inspection and Production of
Documents, Set One.  
 
As for sanctions, in the chapters of
the Civil Discovery Act governing interrogatories and requests for production,
the Legislature has authorized sanctions in the context of a motion to compel
initial responses “against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully
makes or opposes” the motion to compel. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c) & 2031.300, subd. (c).)
Here, Plaintiff Ilsa Miranda has not opposed the motions. 
 
Accordingly, the requests for
sanctions are denied.

The Court GRANTS Defendant’s motions
to compel Plaintiff Ilsa Miranda to respond to Form Interrogatories, Special
Interrogatories, and Requests for Production.
