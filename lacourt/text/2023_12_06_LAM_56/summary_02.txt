And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion to quash a deposition subpoena filed by Behrooz Khavari, a non-party, and the opposition and reply papers filed by the plaintiffs. The motion is denied because it does not cite to any legal authority or admissible evidence to support Khavari's arguments. Additionally, the court declines to consider new evidence offered in the reply brief. The court finds that the motion is waived due to the lack of support for Khavari's contentions. The court grants the request for judicial notice as to the existence of the documents and their legal effect, but not to the truth of the matters stated therein. The ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 1987.1 and 708.150, as well as several California appellate court cases.
