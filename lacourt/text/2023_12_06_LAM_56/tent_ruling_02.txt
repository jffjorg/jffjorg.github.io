  CASE NO.: 23STCP02406
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: MOTION TO QUASH
  SUBPOENA
 
Date: 
  December 6, 2023
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56



 
 
MOVING PARTY:
Non-party Behrooz Khavari (“Khavari”)
 
RESPONDING PARTY:
Plaintiffs
 
The Court has considered
the moving, opposition and reply papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
This is an action
to enforce a judgment that was entered in a Nevada state court.  On October 17, 2023, Khavari filed a motion
to quash a deposition subpoena that Plaintiffs served on him (the
“Motion”).  
 
 
 
 
 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
Plaintiffs’
Request for Judicial Notice is GRANTED as to the existence of the documents and their legal effect, but not to
the truth of the matters stated therein. 
(See Dominguez v. Bonta
(2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 389, 400.)
 
DISCUSSION
Under California Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section 1987.1,
subdivision (a), if a subpoena requires the attendance of a witness or the
production of books, documents, electronically stored information, or other
things before a court, or at the trial of an issue therein, or at the taking of
a deposition, the court, upon motion made by any person described in CCP
section 1987.1, subdivision (b), or upon the court’s own motion after giving
counsel notice and an opportunity to be heard, may make an order quashing the
subpoena entirely, modifying it or directing compliance with it upon those
terms or conditions as the court shall declare.  (CCP § 1987.1, subd. (a).)  
 
CCP section 708.150, subdivision
(a) provides: if a corporation, partnership, association, trust, limited
liability company, or other organization is served with an order to appear for
an examination, it shall designate to appear and be examined one or more
officers, directors, managing agents, or other persons who are familiar with
its property and debts.  (CCP § 708.150,
subd. (a)(1).)


 
 
            The Motion does not cite to any legal authority or admissible
evidence to support Khavari’s arguments. 
A party’s contentions are waived when a party fails to support them
with reasoned argument and citations to authority.  (Moulton Niguel
Water Dist. v. Colombo (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1210, 1215.)  Furthermore,
the Khavari Declaration cited in the Motion was not filed with the moving
papers, and the Court declines to consider new evidence offered in the reply
brief.  (See Jay v. Mahaffey (2013)
218 Cal.App.4th 1522, 1537.)  The Court
therefore DENIES the Motion. 
 
             Moving party is ordered to give notice of this
ruling.
 
Parties who intend to
submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the
department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
 
       Dated this 6th day of December 2023
