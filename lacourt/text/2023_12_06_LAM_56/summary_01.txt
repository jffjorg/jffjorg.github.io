And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to relieve counsel, Ruben Guerra, as the attorney for the plaintiff, Juan R. Andrades. The motion is unopposed and Guerra has declared that there has been a breakdown in the attorney/client relationship, which would prevent continued representation. The Court finds this to be an adequate basis for withdrawal. As a result, the Court grants the motion. The parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling, and any objections must be submitted via email to the Court. If no objections are received and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be taken off calendar.
