And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings in this case, which arises from an employment relationship. The defendant argues that the plaintiff's individual PAGA claims are subject to arbitration under an arbitration agreement that the plaintiff entered into during her employment. The court finds that the plaintiff's individual PAGA claims are arbitrable and orders that they be resolved in arbitration. The court stays the remainder of the action pending the conclusion of the arbitration proceedings. A status conference is scheduled for June 5, 2024.
