[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: MOTION TO BE
  RELIEVED AS COUNSEL

Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
Judge: Holly J. Fujie
Jury Trial: March 25, 2024
 



 
MOVING PARTY: Ruben Guerra (“Guerra”)
 
On November 8,
2023, Guerra filed a motion to be relieved as Plaintiff’s counsel (the
“Motion”).  The Motion is compliant with
California Rules of Court, rule
3.1362.  The Motion is unopposed.  Any opposition papers were required to have
been filed and served at least nine court days before the hearing under
California Code of Civil Procedure section 1005, subdivision (b).
 
DISCUSSION
The court has
discretion on whether to allow an attorney to withdraw, and a motion to
withdraw will not be granted where withdrawal would prejudice the client.  (Ramirez
v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  
 
 
In support of the
Motion, Guerra declares that there has been a breakdown of the attorney/client
relationship that prevents the representation from continuing.  The Court finds this to be an adequate basis
for withdrawal.  For this reason and
because it is unopposed, the Court GRANTS the Motion.  (Sexton v. Superior Court
(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)  
 
Moving party is
ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
 
Parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to
the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on
the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive
an email and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed
off calendar. 
 
         Dated this 6th day of December 2023
