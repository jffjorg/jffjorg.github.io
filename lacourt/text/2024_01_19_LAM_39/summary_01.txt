And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Guninder Singh v. County of Los Angeles, et al. The plaintiff, Guninder Singh, is the Director of the Records and Identification Bureau for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. The defendants are the County of Los Angeles, Kresimir Kovac, Brian Yanagi, John Burcher, and Lewis Lim.

The plaintiff alleges that she was subjected to retaliation and intentional infliction of emotional distress by the defendants after she reported issues with her unit's funding and staffing shortages. The plaintiff claims that the defendants conducted a sham investigation and notified her of an administrative investigation, which was retaliatory.

The judge has overruled the demurrer to the first cause of action against the County of Los Angeles, finding that the plaintiff may proceed on a narrow theory that the Sheriff's Department subjected her to a "sham" investigation in retaliation for her complaints. The judge has sustained the demurrer to the second cause of action, intentional infliction of emotional distress, finding that the plaintiff's allegations do not meet the requirements for this tort.

The judge has denied the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages, finding that the motion is moot since the plaintiff cannot seek punitive damages against a public entity defendant. The judge has set a final status conference for June 27, 2025, and a trial date for July 8, 2025.

The judge has also issued several orders, including ordering the County of Los Angeles to file an answer within 30 days, setting deadlines for disclosure of witnesses and exhibits, and requiring counsel for the County of Los Angeles to provide notice and file proof of such with the Court.
