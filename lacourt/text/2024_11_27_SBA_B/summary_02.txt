And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal as to the County of Los Angeles. The plaintiff's counsel had mistakenly and inadvertently filed a request for dismissal without prejudice as to the County of Los Angeles on May 1, 2024. The counsel declared that the mistake was due to a sequence of mistakes and misunderstandings by himself and his staff. The judge found that the mistake was excusable and that the statute of limitations had not run, allowing the plaintiff to pursue the County in a new action. The judge ordered the dismissal to be vacated and the plaintiff to give notice of the ruling.
