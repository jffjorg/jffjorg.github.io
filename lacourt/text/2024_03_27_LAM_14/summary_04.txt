And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the demurrer filed by Defendant Creative Artists Agency, LLC is sustained with 20 days leave to amend. The Judge denied Defendant's request for judicial notice, finding that it would invite the court to make factual conclusions about what Plaintiff must have or should have known. The Judge also found that Plaintiff's Complaint lacks details about the discovery of the alleged harm, specifically the manner in which the discovery was made and the inability to make earlier discovery despite reasonable diligence. The Judge notes that the Discovery Rule is not a high hurdle at the pleadings stage, but Plaintiff must provide more details to allow for assessment. The Judge grants Plaintiff 20 days to amend the Complaint to provide the necessary details.
