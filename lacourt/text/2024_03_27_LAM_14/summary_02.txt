Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied a motion filed by Petitioner Michael Safar to prevent State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (State Farm) from disclosing his policy limits to the arbitrator. The judge finds that this is not a discovery motion, but rather a motion to exclude evidence from the hearing on the merits, which will be conducted by the arbitrator. The judge has no jurisdiction to grant such a motion, as the arbitrator has exclusive jurisdiction to determine what evidence will be admitted or excluded in proceedings conducted before them.
