 Case Number:  23STCP03721    Hearing Date:   March 27, 2024    Dept:  14 Safar v State FarmCase Background
 
This matter comes to this court via
a special procedure set forth in the Insurance Code. When a person is in an
automobile accident with an “Underinsured Motorist” (or “UIM”), and they have a
dispute with their own insurer, the dispute goes to arbitration. Insurance Code
§ 11580.2(f). However, discovery motions are to be decided by a court, not
the arbitrator. Id.  
 
            On October
9, 2023, Petitioner Michael Safar (“Petitioner”) filed a petition in this court
seeking to open a case number under which either he or Respondent State Farm
Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (“Respondent” or “State Farm”) could file
discovery motions.
 
Instant Motion
 
            Petitioner
now moves this court for an order preventing State Farm from disclosing his
policy limits to the arbitrator.
 
Decision
 
            The motion
is DENIED.
 
Discussion
 
            This is not
a discovery motion. Petitioner is not asking this court to order the disclosure
of evidence as between parties, nor is he asking the court to halt a request
propounded on him by another party. This is a motion to exclude evidence from
the hearing on the merits, which will be conducted by the arbitrator. This
court has no jurisdiction to grant such a motion. The arbitrator has exclusive
jurisdiction to determine what evidence will be admitted or excluded in
proceedings conducted before them.
