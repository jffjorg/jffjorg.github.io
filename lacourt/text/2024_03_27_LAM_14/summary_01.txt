And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to continue the trial to October 7, 2024, in order to allow them to file a new motion for summary adjudication. The judge has also set aside August 26, 2024, for the defendants to file their motion for summary adjudication. The trial date has been continued from April 8, 2024, to October 7, 2024, and the final status conference has been continued to September 25, 2024. The judge has also noted that the defendants should not be deprived of their statutory right to discovery on the newly-framed 12th-cause of action, or their statutory right to file for summary adjudication on that claim, simply because there was a defect in the plaintiff's prior complaint.
