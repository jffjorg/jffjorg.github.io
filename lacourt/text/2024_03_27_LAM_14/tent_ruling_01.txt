Trial Date
 
            Jury Trial
is currently set for April 8, 2024.
 
Instant Motion
 
            Defendants now
move this court for an order continuing trial out a sufficient length so that
they can serve and file a new motion for summary adjudication.
 
Decision
 
            The motion
is GRANTED. The court reserves August 26, 2024, for the motion for summary
adjudication. Defense counsel is to make the reservation online and then call Department
14 to have it confirmed. The motion and all related papers should be filed and
served in accord with the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure § 437c.
 
            Trial is
continued to October 7, 2024, at 9:00 am. Final Status Conference is continued
to September 25, 2024, at 10:00 am. All trial counsel and any unrepresented
parties are to be present in person at the Final Status Conference. All
discovery deadlines are to be calculated based on the new trial date.
 
Discussion
 
            Defendant
Michele’s motion for summary judgment came on for hearing on February 5, 2024.
This court construed a portion of the motion as a motion for judgment on the
pleadings. It granted that portion of the motion with leave to amend. The
filing of the TAC then mooted a portion of the motion for summary adjudication
filed by Defendants Darrell and Firm. The TAC changed the 12th cause
of action from a claim for FEHA discrimination to a claim for FEHA retaliation.
 
            Defense
should not be deprived of their statutory right to discovery on the
newly-framed 12th-cause of action, or their statutory right to file for
summary adjudication on that claim, simply because there was a defect in
Plaintiff’s prior complaint. The court has an opening for a summary judgment
motion at the end of August, and an opening on its trial calendar in early
October.
