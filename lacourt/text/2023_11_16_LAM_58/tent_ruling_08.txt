Corporation v. East Bay Union of Machinists, Local 1304, United Steelworkers of
America, AFL–CIO, et al. (1964) 227 Cal.App.2d 675, 712 [“The objection to
such exhibit was, however, a general one. An inadmissible portion of a
document, the remainder of which is admissible in evidence, cannot be reached
by a general objection to the admission of the entire document, but the
inadmissible portion must be specified.”].)


[2]           Although
Jet Aviation disputes these conversations occurred, it accepts Plaintiff’s
allegations for the purposes of this motion. 


[3]           Jet Aviation
notes that the only written record of complaints regarding fumes occurred in on
July 17, 2020 – based on an email written by Riedel – and September 17, 2020 –
in another email written by Riedel. (Schubert Decl., Ex. A [Pl. Depo. 204:2-18,
Ex. 23; Pl. Depo. 207:15-24, Ex. 30].) 
 


[4]           It is
unclear how these complaints regarding exhaust fumes fit into Plaintiff’s
claims. Plaintiff seems to suggest that Jet Aviation’s concern in remedying
these complaints came from its knowledge that she was pregnant. (SAC ¶ 105.) There
is no evidence to support this connection. 


[5]           A thin
reason for termination is not unlawful where Plaintiff is “an at-will employee,
who could be terminated from employment at any time without case, for any or no
reason, and subject to no procedure except the statutory requirement of
notice.” (Trop v. Sony Pictures Entertainment, Inc. (2005) 129
Cal.App.4th 1133, 1149.) 


[6]           “FEHA's
reference to a “known” disability is read to mean a disability of which the
employer has become aware, whether because it is obvious, the employee has
brought it to the employer's attention, it is based on the employer's own
perception—mistaken or not—of the existence of a disabling condition or,
perhaps as here, the employer has come upon information indicating the presence
of a disability.” (Gelfo v. Lockheed Martin Corp. (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th
34, 61.)
