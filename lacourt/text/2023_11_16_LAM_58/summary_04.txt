And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the proposed settlement agreement between Karlin Parties and Designing Edge (DE) and has determined that the settlement was made in good faith. The settlement agreement provides for DE to pay $650,000 to Karlin Parties in exchange for a full settlement and release of all claims against them and a dismissal of the cross-complaint. The court found that the settlement amount is within the ballpark of DE's possible share of liability, as determined by an expert's damage report, and that the settlement was reached in good faith as an arm's length transaction before neutral mediators. The court also noted that the payment of the settlement amount is being made by DE's insurance carriers, and that there are no issues with the insurance policy limits. The court granted the motion for determination of good faith settlement, finding that the settlement was made in compliance with the Tech-Bilt factors and in accordance with California Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6.
