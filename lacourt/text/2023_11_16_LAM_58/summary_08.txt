And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion related to a termination of employment. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant, Jet Aviation, terminated their employment due to their pregnancy, but Jet Aviation disputes this claim. The judge notes that Jet Aviation has accepted the plaintiff's allegations for the purposes of this motion. The judge is unclear how the complaints regarding exhaust fumes in July and September 2020 fit into the plaintiff's claims. The judge finds that a thin reason for termination may be lawful for an at-will employee, but notes that there is no evidence to support the connection between the complaints and the plaintiff's pregnancy. The judge references California laws and court cases, including FEHA and Trop v. Sony Pictures Entertainment, Inc., to guide their decision.
