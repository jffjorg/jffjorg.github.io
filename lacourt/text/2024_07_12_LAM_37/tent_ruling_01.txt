opposes the Motion. The matter is now before the court. 
 
motion for
judgment on the pleadings[1]
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
“A motion for judgment on the
pleadings performs the same function as a general demurrer, and hence attacks
only defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings or by matters that can be
judicially noticed.” (Burnett v. Chimney Sweep (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th
1057, 1064.) “In deciding or reviewing a judgment on the pleadings, all
properly pleaded material facts are deemed to be true, as well as all facts
that may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged.” (Fire Ins.
Exchange v. Superior Court (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 446, 452.) When
considering demurrers and judgment on the pleadings, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context. (Wilson v. Transit Authority of City
of Sacramento (1962) 199 Cal.App.2d 716, 720-21.) 
 
A motion for judgment on the
pleadings does not lie as to a portion of a cause of action. (Id.) “In
the case of either a demurrer or a motion for judgment on the pleadings, leave
to amend should be granted if there is any reasonable possibility that the
plaintiff can state a good cause of action.” (Gami v. Mullikin Medical Ctr.
(1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 870, 876.) A non-statutory motion for judgment on the
pleadings may be made any time before or during trial. (Stoops v. Abbassi
(2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 644, 650.)¿¿
 
II.        Request for Judicial Notice
 
The court may take judicial notice
of “official acts of the legislative, executive, and judicial departments of
the United States and of any state of the United States,” “[r]ecords of (1) any
court of this state or (2) any court of record of the United States or of any
state of the United States,” and “[f]acts and propositions that are not
reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of immediate and accurate determination
by resort to sources of reasonably indisputable accuracy.” (Evid. Code, § 452,
subds. (c), (d), and (h).) “Taking judicial notice of a document is
not the same as accepting the truth of its contents or accepting a particular
interpretation of its meaning.” (Joslin v. H.A.S. Ins. Brokerage (1986)
184 Cal.App.3d 369, 374.)
 
Moving
Defendants request judicial notice of the following:      
 
1)    
Exhibit A: A true and correct copy of
Plaintiff Omar Penny's Charge of Discrimination, dated August 6, 2021, filed
with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (hereinafter "EEOC")
naming LAC + USC Medical Center as his employer, with an address of 1200 N.
State Street, Los Angeles, CA 90033, bearing the Agency Charge Number
480-2021-03579, along with its attachment. 
 
2)    
Exhibit B: A true and correct copy of
Plaintiff Omar Penney's Amended Charge of Discrimination dated December 3,
2021, filed with the EEOC, naming LAC+USC Medical Center as his employer,
bearing the Agency Charge Number 480-2021-03579, along with its attachment. 
 
3)    
Exhibit C: A true and correct copy of
Plaintiff Omar Penney's Amended Charge of Discrimination dated December 3,
2021, filed with the EEOC, naming LAC+USC Medical Center as his employer,
bearing the Agency Charge Number 480-2021-03579, along with its attachment. 
 
4)    
Exhibit D: A true and correct copy of
Plaintiff Omar Penney's Charge of Discrimination, dated August 6, 2021, filed
with the EEOC, naming Los Angeles County as his employer, with an address of
500 W. Temple Street, Room 358, Los Angeles CA 90012, bearing the Agency Charge
Number 480-2021-0358, along with its attachment. 
 
Moving Defendants’
request for judicial notice is granted. 
 
Plaintiff requests judicial
notice of the following: 
 
1)    
A true and correct copy of Plaintiff Omar
Penny’s Right to Sue Package, dated April 7, 2023, filed with the Department of
Fair Employment and Housing (hereinafter “DFEH”) naming Defendants County of
Los Angeles, LAC+USC Medical Center, The Los Angeles County – USC Medical
Center Auxiliary, Theresa Saracho, Jorge Fuentes, Philip Hyden, Rosario
Tanphanich, Melissa Valenzuela, Nune Abraamyan, and Anthony Meza as
Co-Respondents, bearing the Civil Rights Department Matter Number:
202304-20205507, stating Plaintiff was harassed because of his religious creed,
sex/gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, and sexual
harassment – hostile work environment, along with its attachment, attached
hereto as Exhibit A.
 
Moving Defendants’ object to the
request for judicial notice because Plaintiff did not attach nor provide
Defendants with a copy of Exhibit A. Evid. Code § 453(b) requires the moving
party to “[f]urnish the court with sufficient information o enable [the court]
to take judicial notice of the matter.” As Plaintiff failed to attach Exhibit
A to the request for judicial notice or the opposing papers, the court
denies Plaintiff’s request for judicial notice. 
 
III.      Discussion
 
A.        Failure to Exhaust Administrative
Remedies Under FEHA
 
“Under FEHA, the employee must exhaust the administrative
remedy provided by the statute by filing a complaint with the Department of
Fair Employment and Housing (Department) and must obtain from the Department a
notice of right to sue in order to be entitled to file a civil action in court
based on violations of the FEHA.” (Romano v. Rockwell Internat., Inc.
(1996) 14 Cal.4th 479, 492; see also Gov. Code, §§ 12960, 12965(b).) “The
timely filing of an administrative complaint is a prerequisite to the bringing
of a civil action for damages under FEHA.” (Romano, at p. 492.) 
 
Moving Defendants assert plaintiff failed to exhaust his
administrative remedies with respect to the harassment claims in his Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) charges. (RJN, Ex. A, B.) plaintiff asserts that his
administrative charges with the EEOC, filed on August 1, 2022, and December 3,
2021, properly named Moving Defendants as respondents. Plaintiff’s opposition adds
that “Plaintiff filed a further administrative charge with DFEH on April 7,
2023. And obtained a right-to sue letter[.]” (Opposition, at p.  4:28-5:1.) By Plaintiff’s admission, Plaintiff
did not obtain a right-to-sue letter from the Department of Fair Employment and
Housing (“DFEH”) until after April 7, 2023, which occurred after Plaintiff
filed this FEHA action on March 29, 2023. 
 
Therefore, Plaintiff did not exhaust his administrative
claims for FEHA-based causes of action prior to filing this action because he
had not yet obtained a right-to-sue letter from DFEH. “DFEH
had up to one year from the filing of the administrative claim to complete its
investigation and issue a ‘right-to-sue’ letter (Gov. Code, § 12965, subd.
(c)(1)(A)), and a lawsuit alleging FEHA claims had to be filed within one year
of the issuance of the ‘right-to-sue’ letter. (Gov. Code, §§ 12960, subd.
(f)(1)(B), 12965, subd. (c)(1)(C).).” (Ramirez v. Charter
Communications, Inc. (2022) 75 Cal.App.5th 365, 374.) The operative
Complaint is silent as to when Plaintiff obtained a right-to-sue letter from
the DFEH and merely asserts in a conclusory manner “Plaintiff has exhausted all
administrative remedies necessary and has timely brought this action.” (Compl.,
¶ 20.) 
 
Moreover, the filing of an EEOC charge does not satisfy the
administrative exhaustion requirement for FEHA-based actions:
 
[U]nder
the federal statute it implements (42 U.S.C. § 2000e–5(f)(1)), an EEOC
right-to-sue notice satisfies the requirement of exhaustion of administrative
remedies only for purposes of an action based on Title VII.
Inasmuch as Martin elected to base her action not on Title VII but on the Fair
Employment and Housing Act the EEOC right-to-sue notice technically did not
satisfy the jurisdictional requirement that Martin have exhausted her
administrative remedies as to the asserted violations of the California statute.



(Martin v. Lockheed Missiles & Space Co. (1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1718, 1726 (Martin)
 [italics original].) 
 
The appellate court found similarly in Foroudi v. Aerospace Corporation (2020) 57 Cal.App.5th
992: “All of Foroudi's arguments related to the EEOC charge and right-to-sue
notice suffer the same fatal flaw: the exhaustion of EEOC remedies does not
satisfy the exhaustion requirements for state law claims.” (Id. a p.
1001; see also Reynoso v. County of Ventura (C.D. Cal., Mar.
8, 2022, No. 2:19-CV-05687-KES) 2022 WL 2092909, at *10 [“In contrast, the
County has cited Martin, a case from the California
Court of Appeal, holding that FEHA exhaustion requires a DFEH right-to-sue
letter, even if the plaintiff has an EEOC right-to-sue letter on the same claim”].)
In deciding the inverse, whether a right-to-sue letter from the DFEH but not
the EEOC entitles the plaintiff to pursue claims under Title VII, the appellate
court stated, “we see no reason for a
rule other than Martin to apply” and found
that plaintiff could not pursue Title VII-based claims. (Roman v. County of Los Angeles (2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 316, 326.) 
 
Here, Moving Defendants demurrer to Plaintiff’s first, second,
and third causes of action for harassment in violation of Gov. Code § 12940(j),
twelfth cause of action for aiding and abetting discrimination in violation of
FEHA (Gov. Code § 12940(i) and fourteenth cause of action for IIED. The first,
second, and twelfth causes of action are premised on statutory FEHA violations
and Plaintiff fails to show he obtained a FEHA right-to-sue letter prior to the
filing of this action. “We agree that exhaustion of the FEHA administrative remedy is a precondition to
bringing a civil suit on a statutory cause of action.” (Rojo v. Kliger (1990) 52 Cal.3d 65, 83 [italics
original].) Accordingly,
the MJOP to the first, second, and twelfth causes of action is granted without
leave to amend as Plaintiff fails to show he exhausted his administrative
remedies under FEHA[2]. 
 
“[A]lthough an employee must exhaust the FEHA administrative remedy before bringing suit
on a cause of action under the act or seeking the relief provided therein, exhaustion is not required before filing a
civil action for damages alleging nonstatutory causes
of action.” (Rojo, supra, 52
Cal.3d at p. 88.) “An employee, of course, may elect to waive the statutory
cause of action and remedies, and proceed directly to court on the common law
claims [citation]; alternatively, the employee may pursue both the administrative and the judicial avenues,
either sequentially [citations] or simultaneously, in the latter case amending
his or her complaint to join the FEHA
cause of action once the Department has issued the right-to-sue letter [.]” (Id.
at pp. 144-145.) 
 
In the Complaint, the IIED claim is premised
on discriminatory and harassing conduct under the FEHA. Accordingly, the IIED
claim also fails because it is derivative of the FEHA claims. “By engaging in
the above-described conduct, Defendants engaged in extreme and outrageous
conduct with the intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the probability
of causing, emotional distress.” (Compl., ¶ 236.) However, the court grants the
MJOP as to the IIED claim with leave to amend as it is a nonstatutory cause of
action capable of amendment. 
 
Conclusion
 
Moving Defendants’ MJOP is granted without leave to amend as
to the first, second, third, and twelfth causes of action. The MJOP is granted as
to the fourteenth cause of action with 10 days leave to amend. The Court sets
an OSC Re Amended Complaint for August 2, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Moving Defendants
to give notice.
