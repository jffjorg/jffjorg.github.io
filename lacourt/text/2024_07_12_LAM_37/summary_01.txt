English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion for judgment on the pleadings (MJOP) as to the first, second, third, and twelfth causes of action without leave to amend, as the plaintiff failed to exhaust administrative remedies under the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA). The court also grants the MJOP as to the fourteenth cause of action with 10 days leave to amend, as it is a non-statutory cause of action. The court sets an OSC Re Amended Complaint for August 2, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. to allow the plaintiff to amend its complaint.
