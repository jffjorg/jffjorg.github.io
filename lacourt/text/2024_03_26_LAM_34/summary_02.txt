And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on several motions filed by Mira Jeon Kim. The ruling grants in part Mira Jeon Kim's motions to compel responses to Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Production, ordering Jan Bidasha to serve responses without objections within 30 days. However, the judge denies Mira Jeon Kim's motion for judgment on the pleadings, finding that the issues raised are unripe and may be raised again after judgment is entered in a related case. The judge also denies Mira Jeon Kim's request for monetary sanctions.
