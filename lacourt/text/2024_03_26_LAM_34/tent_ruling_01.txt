        On
February 28, 2024, the Court quashed deposition subpoenas served by Defendant
LA Valley Management, LLC on various entities related to Plaintiff. 
 
        On

and Quash Defendant David Carlin’s Deposition Notice of Shawn Conger Love
(“Motion to Quash Re Love”); and (2) Motion to Stay and Quash Defendant David
Carlin’s Notice of Deposition of Marsha Spencer and Request for Production of

quash. 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal
Standard
 
“If a subpoena
requires the attendance of a witness or the production of books, documents,
electronically stored information, or other things before a court, or at the
trial of an issue therein, or at the taking of a deposition, the court, upon
motion reasonably made by any person described in subdivision (b), or upon the
court’s own motion after giving counsel notice and an opportunity to be heard,
may make an order quashing the subpoena entirely, modifying it, or directing
compliance with it upon those terms or conditions as the court shall declare,
including protective orders. In addition, the court may make any other order as
may be appropriate to protect the person from unreasonable or oppressive
demands, including unreasonable violations of the right of privacy of the
person.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.1, subd. (a).)
 
“Before, during, or after a deposition, any party, any deponent, or any
other affected natural person or organization may promptly move for a protective
order. The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under
Section 2016.040.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.420, subd. (a).)
 
“The court, for good cause shown, may make any order that justice
requires to protect any party, deponent, or other natural person or
organization from unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression, or undue
burden and expense.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2025.420, subd. (b).)
 
Courts have considerable discretion in granting and crafting protective
orders. (Raymond Handling Concepts Corp.
v. Super. Ct. (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 584, 588.)
 
II.      
Discussion
 
Plaintiff, in propria persona, moves the Court to quash: (1) the
deposition notice issued by Defendant on Shawn Conger Love; and (2) the
deposition notice and request for production of documents issued by Defendant
on Marsha Spencer. (Motion to Quash Re Love, p. 4:14–17; Motion to Quash Re Spencer,
p. 4:2–7.)
 
Plaintiff argues: (1) that discovery is closed; (2) that this is a
violation of Plaintiff’s privacy; and (3) that these individuals do not possess
any relevant or admissible evidence related to Plaintiff’s claim. (Motion to
Quash Re Love, p. 2:5–21; Motion to Quash Re Spencer, p. 2:3–17.)
 
        Defendant opposes the Motion, arguing:
(1) that the deponents have relevant information; and (2) that Plaintiff
implicitly waived her right to privacy and may not preclude discovery.
(Opposition to Motion to Quash Re Love, pp. 2:19, 4:7–8, 5:1; Opposition to
Motion to Quash Re Spencer, pp. 3:25, 5:3–4.)
 
        Plaintiff has the better arguments here.

 
“Except as
otherwise provided in this chapter, any party shall be entitled as a matter of
right to complete discovery proceedings on or before the 30th day, and to have
motions concerning discovery heard on or before the 15th day, before the date
initially set for the trial of the action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (a).)
 
“Except
as provided in Section 2024.050, a continuance or postponement of the trial
date does not operate to reopen discovery proceedings.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2024.020, subd. (b).)
 
“When the last
day to perform or complete any act provided for in this title falls on a
Saturday, Sunday, or holiday as specified in Section 10, the time limit is
extended until the next court day closer to the trial date.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2016.060.)
 
On February 16, 2022, the Court initially set trial in this matter for
April 3, 2023. On February 28, 2023, the Court continued trial to August 14,
2023. On July 13, 2023, the Court continued trial to January 22, 2024. On
November 7, 2023, the Court continued trial to March 25, 2024 — and the Court
ordered that “[a]ll discovery cutoff dates are determined by the new trial
date.” (Minute Order dated November 7, 2023, p. 6.) On February 28, 2024, the
Court continued trial to April 29, 2024 — and ordered that “[d]iscovery is not
re-opened.”
 
Thus, discovery proceedings were required to have been completed on
February 26, 2024 and motions concerning discovery were required to have been
heard on March 11, 2024. 
 
        Defendant admits that these depositions
have not occurred. (Opposition to Motion to Quash Re Love, p. 2:13–17;
Opposition to Motion to Quash Re Spencer, pp. 2:27–3:6.) The present hearing is
being held on March 26, 2024. As discovery wasto  have been completed on February 26, 2024 and
any motions to compel such discovery were to have been heard by March 11, 2024,
further depositions would be untimely. Therefore, the deposition notices should
be quashed. 
 
        Furthermore, the request for production
of documents served on Marsha Spencer appears to be overbroad and violative of
Plaintiff’s privacy. (Motion to Quash Re Spencer, Exh. A, p. 5.) The reasoning
here is the same as that previously discussed by the Court regarding Defendant
LA Valley Management’s deposition subpoenas. (Minute Order dated February 28,
2024, pp. 5–6.)
 
Finally,
Plaintiff has been litigating this matter in propria persona. To the pro per litigant, “interrogatories,
requests for admissions, law and motion proceedings, and the like” are
“baffling devices.” (Bruno v. Super. Ct. (1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 1359,
1363, quoting Burley v. Stein (1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 752, 755, fn. 3.) “Providing access to justice for
self-represented litigants is a priority for California courts.”¿ (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 10.960(b).) The Court has not been presented with sufficient
evidence to find that Plaintiff waived her right to privacy.

Re Love is GRANTED.
