Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge rules that the Motion to Quash the Deposition Notice of Shawn Conger Love and the Motion to Quash the Deposition Notice of Marsha Spencer and Request for Production of Documents are both granted. The judge finds that discovery proceedings were required to have been completed on February 26, 2024, and motions concerning discovery were required to have been heard on March 11, 2024. Since the depositions have not occurred and the discovery deadline has passed, the deposition notices should be quashed. Additionally, the judge finds that the request for production of documents served on Marsha Spencer appears to be overbroad and violative of Plaintiff's privacy. The judge notes that providing access to justice for self-represented litigants is a priority for California courts and that the Court has not been presented with sufficient evidence to find that Plaintiff waived her right to privacy.
