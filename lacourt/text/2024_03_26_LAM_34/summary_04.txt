And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to determine good faith settlement filed by the defendants LNP Everland, Inc., The H Realty, Eui S. Chang, and Christina Kwon. The motion was opposed by the defendant Emotional Health Association. The court found that the proposed settlement of $9,000.00 between the plaintiff Sean McDowell and the settling defendants was not supported by sufficient evidence and did not pass the Tech-Bilt factors. The court was concerned that the settling defendants may be trying to settle their liability for a disproportionately low amount of money and that both the plaintiff and non-settling defendant may be severely prejudiced by the proposed settlement.
