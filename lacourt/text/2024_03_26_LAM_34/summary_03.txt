And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the demurrers filed by the defendants, Edwin Haratonians, Adrineh Asatourian, and Jason Boutros, to the second and third causes of action in the plaintiff, Maurice Maalouf's, Second Amended Complaint. The demurrers were filed in response to allegations of fraud and deceit in the healthcare industry, including claims that the defendants engaged in a scheme to defraud the federal and state government Medicare and Medicaid programs.

The court found that the pleadings are sufficient to state a cause of action under the federal False Claims Act and the California False Claims Act, and that the allegations of fraud and deceit are not impermissibly speculative. The court also disagreed with the defendants' arguments that the pleadings lack specificity and that the plaintiff's allegations are not well-pled.

The court denied the demurrers and overruled the joinder in demurrers, allowing the case to proceed to the next stage of litigation.
