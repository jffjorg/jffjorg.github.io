[1]             “Following the outbreak of COVID-19
in March 2020, the Judicial Council of California adopted an emergency rule
that extended the deadline to bring a civil action to trial under section
583.310.” (State ex rel. Sills v. Gharib-Danesh (2023) 88 Cal.App.5th
824, 840.) Emergency rule 10(a) provides: “Notwithstanding any other law,
including ... section 583.310, for all civil actions filed on or before April
6, 2020, the time in which to bring the action to trial is extended by six months
for a total time of five years and six months.” (Emergency rule 10(a); see Ables
v. A. Ghazale Brothers, Inc. (2022) 74 Cal.App.5th 823, 825.)  Because of common usage, the Court refers to
the requirement that the case be brought to trial or face mandatory dismissal
as the “five-year” deadline.
 


[2]             Plaintiffs also contend they were
ready for trial in Department 58 prior to December 27, 2023 and but for
Defendants moving the matter to Long Cause, the matter would have been ready
for trial.
