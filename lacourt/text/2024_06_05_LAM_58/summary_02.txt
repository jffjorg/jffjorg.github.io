And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the defendants' motion to dismiss the case for failure to bring it to trial within the five-year period. The court finds that the delay was due to circumstances beyond the plaintiffs' control, including the unavailability of long cause courtrooms. The court tolls the deadline to bring the case to trial to February 10, 2025. The court also notes that the parties have exercised reasonable diligence in prosecuting the case and that the delay was not due to the plaintiffs' own conduct.
