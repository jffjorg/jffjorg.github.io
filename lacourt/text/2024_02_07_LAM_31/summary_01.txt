And here is the English summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Judge grants the motion for an order allowing service of Defendant Johnny Hickey by publication in the Boston Globe and Los Angeles Times newspapers. The Plaintiff, Josue Valdez, has been unable to serve the Defendant despite diligent efforts. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant is a necessary party to the action and that the Defendant is responsible for fraudulently inducing the Plaintiff to transfer $30,000. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff is entitled to an order allowing service of the Defendant by publication based on the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 415.50 and that service by publication is proper considering the Defendant may live and/or frequent Boston, Massachusetts, and the alleged actions took place in the county of Los Angeles.
