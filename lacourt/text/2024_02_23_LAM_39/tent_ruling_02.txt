 Case Number:  BC703537    Hearing Date:   February 23, 2024    Dept:  39 Felix Lopez, et
al. v. Kathleen Williams McBride
Case No. BC703537
Petition to
Confirm Arbitration Award
 
            The Court
ordered the parties to proceed to arbitration. 
(See Court’s Minute Order, dated June 9, 2023.)  Following the arbitration, the arbitrator
found in favor of Defendant.  Now,
Defendant seeks the following relief: (1) Confirmation of the 2023 arbitration
award; (2) Judgment in favor of Defendant, and against Plaintiffs, in the
amount of the attorneys’ fees awarded ($106,792.84); (3) Interest on the
judgment at the statutory rate of 10% since December 9, 2023; and (4)
Attorneys’ fees and costs associated with the instant petition.  
 
A party may seek a court judgment confirming an arbitration award by
filing and serving a petition at least 10 days, but no more than four years
after the arbitrator serves the arbitration award.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1288, 1288.4.)  The Court must confirm the award unless an
opposing party demonstrates good cause to correct or vacate the arbitration
award, or to dismiss the proceedings. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1286.)  If the
Court confirms the award, the Court enters an enforceable judgment with the
same force and effect as a judgment in a civil action.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1287.4.)  
 
Plaintiffs argue that the
arbitrator failed to decide all necessary questions to determine the
controversy.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
1283.4.)  The arbitrator must determine
which issues are necessary to determine. 
(Morris v. Zuckerman (1968) 69 Cal.2d 686, 690.)  A party that challenges an arbitration award
on this basis must meet the heavy burden to rebut the presumption that the
arbitrator resolved all issues submitted to the arbitrator.  (Rodrigues v. Keller (1980) 113
Cal.App.3d 838, 841.)  In this case, Plaintiffs
argue that the arbitrator erred because the arbitrator did not afford due
weight to “the abundant evidence that Plaintiffs adduced in the course of the
arbitration proceedings.”  (See
Opposition to Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award, p. 6.)  Thus, Plaintiffs’ argument is that the
arbitrator erred, not that the arbitrator failed to determine all necessary
issues.  The Court cannot refuse to
confirm an arbitrator’s award based on an error.  (Moncharsh v. Heily & Blase (1992)
3 Cal.4th 1, 28.)  Likewise, Plaintiffs’ argument that the
arbitrator failed to decide all necessary issues because the arbitrator did not
permit Plaintiffs to add a cause of action for negligent interference with
contractual relationships is simply an argument that the arbitrator erred, and
is therefore improper.  
 
The Court finds that Defendant is entitled to attorney’s fees and costs
associated with this petition.  The Court
authorizes attorneys’ fees in the amount of $11,700 based upon 18 hours at a
reasonable billing rate of $650 plus a filing fee of $60.
