Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Fredy Wembe's ex parte application to continue discovery and take additional depositions in his employment action against Defendant Target Stores, Inc., et al. The Court grants the application in part and denies it in part.

The Court authorizes Plaintiff's counsel to take two additional depositions after the discovery cutoff, specifically of Hillary Olsen and Guillermo Escareno. The Court also orders Defendant's counsel to provide the last known contact information for these witnesses unless Defendant's counsel agrees to accept service on their behalf.

The Court denies Plaintiff's motion for contact information for Fidel Vivas and Joshua Portillo, finding that there is no good cause to take their depositions after the discovery cutoff.

The Court sets deadlines for Plaintiff's counsel to file a notice stating which two depositions she intends to take and for Defendant's counsel to provide the last known contact information for the witnesses.

The Court also advances and vacates the final status conference and trial dates and advances and continues the hearing on Defendant's motion for summary judgment.
