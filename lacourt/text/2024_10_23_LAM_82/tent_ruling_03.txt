[1] Because this
declaration responds to Petitioner’s extra-record evidence, the court will
consider it, though the court would reach the same decision even without this
declaration.    
 


[2] Similarly, the
“Notice of Additional Local Counsel” was not dated, and the proof of service
suffers from the same defects as the one accompanying Petitioner’s purported pro
hac vice application. 
 


[3] This opinion was rendered
by Attorney General Xavier Bacerra to the Honorable Zackery P. Morazzini, the
Director and Chief Administrative Law Judge of the Officer of Administrative
Hearings.  “Opinions of the Attorney
General, while not binding, are entitled to great weight.  In the absence of controlling authority,
these opinions are persuasive . . . .”  (Napa
Valley Educators’ Assn. v. Napa Valley Unified School Dist. (1987) 194
Cal.App.3d 243, 251.)    


[4] In fact, the documents contained in Exhibit 21 were provided in
discovery to Petitioner’s then counsel, R.F., on April 21, 2022.  (Rhee Decl. ¶ 12.)  The court need not rely on this declaration
in order to rule on this petition.  It is
Petitioner’s burden to demonstrate that the evidence was produced after the
discovery cut-off, and he fails to do so.
