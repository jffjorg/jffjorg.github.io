```

Summary:

The judge denies the petition for writ of mandate brought by Ara J. Najarian, a member of the City Council, challenging the City Council's decision to select Elen Asatryan as the next mayor. The judge finds that the petition is barred by the doctrine of laches, as Najarian waited almost three months into Asatryan's one-year term before filing the petition. Additionally, the judge concludes that the City Council had the authority to select someone other than Najarian as mayor, and that Najarian is not entitled to a writ of mandate. The judge also finds that the petition is not a proper quo warranto action, as Najarian did not seek leave from the Attorney General to sue in quo warranto.
