v.
                                                                    Hearing:
October 23, 2024
                                                                        Location:
Stanley Mosk Courthouse
                                                                                    Department:
82                                     
City of Long Beach                                                          Judge:
Stephen I. Goorvitch
                        
 
            Petitioners Riverpark Coalition and LA Waterkeeper
(collectively, “Petitioners”) filed a petition seeking a writ of mandate to set
aside an approval of a project by the City of Long Beach (“Respondent”).  The court (Beckloff, J.) granted the petition
and ordered the Real Parties in Interest—Artesia Acquisition Company, LLC
(“Artesia”), Insite Property Group (“Insite”), and the Jeanne Eve McDonald
Revocable Trust (the “Trust”)—to pay attorneys’ fees, per Code of Civil
Procedure section 1021.5, and costs in the total amount of $469,267.19.  In June 2024, Artesia paid $517,581.46, which
includes post-judgment interest, in full satisfaction of the judgment.  Now, Artesia seeks an order requiring the
Trust to pay half this amount.  
 
            Counsel
for Artesia did not serve the City of Long Beach with this motion.  The City is entitled to notice because how
the court apportions the judgment may impact the City.  Indeed, after the court decides the instant
motion, Artesia may seek contribution from the City, and that motion would be
governed by the order on the instant motion. 

 
Therefore, the court has no
tentative order on this motion.
