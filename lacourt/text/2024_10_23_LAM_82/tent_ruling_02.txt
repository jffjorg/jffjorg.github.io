[Tentative] Order Granting Petitioner’s 
Motion to Augment the Administrative
Record
 
[Tentative] Order Denying Petition for
Writ of Mandate
            
INTRODUCTION 
 
             Petitioner John
Edward Humiston, M.D. (“Petitioner”) petitions for a writ of administrative
mandate directing Respondent Medical Board of California (the “Board” or
“Respondent”) to set aside a final administrative decision revoking
Petitioner’s medical license.  Petitioner’s
medical license was revoked for gross negligence, specifically: (1) Petitioner
mishandled the treatment of a patient on an antidepressant and benzodiazepine; (2) Petitioner injected a patient with her own filtrated
urine mixed with lidocaine without obtaining written informed consent; and (3)
Petitioner issued permanent vaccine exemptions to four pediatric patients without
appropriate cause and without following the required medical guidance.  Now, Petitioner challenges the decision on
both due process and substantive grounds. 
Petitioner also moves to augment the
administrative record with various emails and other documents.  The court grants the motion to augment and
denies the petition for writ of mandate. 
  
 
BACKGROUND 
 
A.        Petitioner’s
Care and Treatment of Patient A            
 
From November 2017 through February
2018, Petitioner treated Patient A, a 54-year-old man, with a long history of
taking psychiatric medications, including Cymbalta, Clonazepam, and Trazodone,
to treat depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder.   (AR 2774-2777.)   The
psychiatric medications had been prescribed by Patient A’s treating
psychiatrist, whom he last visited in October 2017.  (Ibid.)  Petitioner treated Patient A with the NeuroRecover
treatment program with the goal of discontinuing Patient A’s use of psychiatric
medications.  (Ibid.)  The NeuroRecover program consists of
intravenous treatments containing combinations of amino acids and vitamins.  (Ibid.) 
Patient A had poor results with the NeuroRecover program and from being abruptly
taken off his psychiatric medications, and he went to an emergency room in
March 2018 with his chief complaints being depression, anxiety, insomnia, and suicidal
ideations. (AR 2778-2779.)
 


 
B.        Petitioner’s
Care and Treatment of Patient B  
 
From February to March 2018,
Petitioner treated Patient B, who was Patient A’s wife, with antigen immune
therapy for allergy symptom relief. (AR 2780-2781.)  This treatment consists of intramuscular
injections of the patient’s own urine, which had been filtered to remove
bacteria and then mixed with lidocaine.  (AR
2780-2781.)  Antigen immune therapy is a
form of “alternative medicine,” and there was no “informed consent” in Patient
B’s medical records showing that Petitioner had informed Patient B of the
risks, possible side effects, or other possible treatment alternatives.  (AR 2780-2781.)
 
C.        Petitioner
Provides Vaccination Exemptions for Patients C, D, E, and F 
 
Between 2015 and 2018, Petitioner
treated Patients C, D, E, and F, who were school age children enrolled in the
San Diego Unified School District.  (AR 2781-2789.)
 Petitioner signed permanent vaccination
exemption forms for these patients so that they could attend school without
first obtaining vaccinations required by the State of California for entry into
school.  (AR 2784-2789.) Petitioner did
not document any accepted medical reasons why Patients C, D, E, and F qualified
for these vaccination exemptions, which would permit the patients to forego
vaccinations for polio, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, measles, mumps,
rubella, haemophilus influenza type B, hepatitis B, and varicella. (AR 2781, 2785-2788.)
 
D.        Petitioner’s
Disciplinary History  
 
Petitioner has prior disciplinary
history.  Specifically, on January 24,
2019, pursuant to a Stipulated Settlement and Decision, Petitioner’s medical
license was publicly reprimanded for his gross negligence in the treatment of
one patient, who was Petitioner’s family member, and his repeated negligent
acts in the care and treatment of the family member and one other patient. (AR 1343-1354,
2767.)  Pursuant to paragraph 9 of the
Stipulated Settlement and Disciplinary Order, all allegations in the prior
accusation are deemed true, correct, and fully admitted by Petitioner. (AR 1345,
2767.)  
 
E.         The
Accusation 
 
On December 16, 2020, the Executive
Director of the Board (“Complainant”) filed an accusation against Petitioner
seeking revocation of his medical license (“Accusation”).  (AR 2767.) 
Petitioner timely filed a Notice of Defense on December 30, 2020, at
that time, represented by attorney Robert Frank.  (AR 1077-1079.)  The Complainant subsequently filed first,
second, and third amended accusations. 
The third amended accusation sought revocation or suspension of
Petitioner’s medical license based on three causes for discipline related to
his care and treatment of Patients A, B, C, D, E, and F: (1) gross negligence
for his care and treatment of Patients A, C, D, E, and F; (2) repeated
negligent acts for his care and treatment of Patients A, B, C, D, E, and F; and
(3) failure to maintain adequate and accurate medical records with regard to
Patient B.  (AR 2767.)  
 


 
F.         Administrative
Hearing and Decision 
 
Administrative proceedings related
to the Accusation were held in 2022 before the Office of Administrative
Hearings (“OAH”).  (AR 2765.)  On July 14, 2022, Petitioner filed a “Respondent’s
Notice of Substitution of Counsel” with OAH, indicating that Frank was
withdrawing as counsel of record and that out-of-state attorney John J.
Richardson was entering an appearance as “substitute counsel.”  (AR 1178-1179.)  Petitioner and Richardson appeared at the
Prehearing and Mandatory Settlement Conferences (“PHC/MSC”), held before an administrative
law judge (the “ALJ”) at OAH, on July 15, 2022.  (AR 1136, 1180.)  On July 19, 2022, the ALJ that oversaw the
PHC/MSC issued an order stating, in relevant part: “Mr. Richardson is not
licensed to practice law in the State of California.  [Complainant’s counsel] objected and stated
she would be filing a motion objecting to his appearance as respondent’s
attorney.  As such, Mr. Richardson stated
he would take steps to resolve this issue.” 
(AR 1180-81.)  As analyzed in the
Discussion section below, there is no evidence that Richardson ever filed with
the OAH an application for pro hac vice admission or other motion
authorizing Richardson to represent Petitioner, as his attorney, in the
administrative proceedings.  The ALJ did
not discuss, or rule upon, a pro hac vice application or similar motion
in the hearing transcript or administrative decision.   
 
The
administrative hearing on the Accusation was held on September 13 through 16,
2022, and December 19, 2022, with ALJ Debra D. Nye-Perkins presiding.  (AR 2765.) 
At the start of each hearing day, ALJ Nye-Perkins confirmed on the
record that Richardson was present with Petitioner and that Petitioner was
representing himself, as Richardson was not licensed to practice law in
California. (AR 46-47, 248, 500, 796, 919-920.) 
The ALJ stated on the record that Richardson was attending the hearing
as an advisor to Petitioner, but she did not permit him to represent Petitioner,
examine witnesses or present other evidence, or make written or oral
arguments.  (See e.g. AR 248-249,
500.)  
 
The
evidence presented at the hearing included, but was not limited to, medical
records for the six patients, written reports of Complainant’s expert
witnesses, Petitioner’s written summaries of care for the patients, and a
transcript of Petitioner’s interview with Board investigators.  (See AR 2766-2804.)  Complainant also offered the expert testimonies
of Cynthia Watson, M.D., who testified regarding Petitioner’s treatment of
Patients A and B, and Dean Blumberg, M.D., who testified regarding Petitioner’s
treatment of Patients C, D, E, and F. (AR 73-209, 922-996, 250-367.)  Petitioner testified on his own behalf
regarding his treatment of the six patients and had four former and current
patients testify about their medical treatment with Petitioner.  Petitioner did not present any expert
testimony in defense.  (See AR 2766-2804.)

 
On
January 12, 2023, ALJ Nye-Perkins issued a 53-page proposed decision which found
clear and convincing evidence in support of all three causes for discipline
alleged in the Third Amended Accusation. (AR 2565-2617.)  The ALJ found that revocation of Petitioner’s
medical license was the appropriate discipline. 
(Ibid.)  The Board adopted
the proposed decision as its Decision and Order on February 6, 2023. (AR 2764.)
 This writ petition followed.  
 


 
STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
Under Code of
Civil Procedure section 1094.5(b), the pertinent issues are whether the
respondent has proceeded without jurisdiction, whether there was a fair trial,
and whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion.  An abuse of discretion is established if the
agency has not proceeded in the manner required by law, the decision is not
supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by the
evidence.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1094.5(b).)
 
The court
exercises its independent judgment on the record, including with respect to
fact findings made by the Board.  (Sandarg v. Dental Board of California (2010)
184 Cal.App.4th 1434, 1440.)  Under the
independent judgment test, “the trial court not only examines the
administrative record for errors of law, but also exercises its independent
judgment upon the evidence disclosed in a limited trial de novo.”  (Bixby v. Pierno (1971) 4 Cal.3d 130,
143.)  The court may draw its own
reasonable inferences from the evidence and make its determinations as to the
credibility of witnesses.  (Morrison v. Housing Authority of the City of
Los Angeles Board of Commissioners (2003) 107 Cal. App. 4th 860, 868.)  “In exercising its independent judgment, a
trial court must afford a strong presumption of correctness concerning the
administrative findings, and the party challenging the administrative decision
bears the burden of convincing the court that the administrative findings are
contrary to the weight of the evidence.” 
(Fukuda v. City of Angels
(1999) 20 Cal. 4th 805, 817.)
 
At the agency
level, the standard of proof to revoke a professional license is
clear and convincing evidence.  (See Lone Star Sec. & Video, Inc. v. Bureau
of Sec. and Investigative Services (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 445, 454.)   “Clear and convincing evidence” reflects “a
high probability of the truth of the facts” asserted. (Mattco Forge, Inc. v.
Arthur Young & Co. (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 820, 847–848.)  The Board applied a clear and convincing
standard in this case.  (AR 2605.)  The Court of Appeal has held that “ a trial court
reviewing an administrative agency's findings under the independent judgment
standard of review in section 1094.5 must …
account for the standard of proof required and applied in the underlying
proceeding.”  (Li v. Sup. Ct. (2021)
69 Cal.App.5th 836, 844.)  Accordingly, in
this ruling, the court uses the phrase “weight of the evidence” to refer to
sufficient evidence to support a finding taking into account the clear and
convincing evidence standard of proof applicable at the agency level.
 
The court
exercises independent judgment on questions of law arising in mandate
proceedings.  (See Christensen v. Lightbourne (2017) 15 Cal.App.5th 1239, 1251.)  “A challenge
to the procedural fairness of the administrative hearing is reviewed de novo on
appeal because the ultimate determination of procedural fairness amounts to a
question of law.”  (Nasha L.L.C. v. City of Los Angeles (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 470,
482.)  
 
EVIDENTIARY ISSUES 
            
            A.        Request for
Judicial Notice 
            
            Petitioner
seeks judicial notice of certain prior decisions by the Medical Board of
California.  Respondents do not oppose
the request for judicial notice.  The
request for judicial notice is granted per Evidence Code section 452(c). 
            B.        Motion to Augment 
 
            Petitioner
moves to augment the administrative record with certain emails produced by
Respondent in discovery, a pro hac vice application, and a Notice of
Association of Counsel from attorney J.R., among other documents.  (See Archibald Decl. ¶ 8, Exh. A; see
also Opposition to Motion to Augment 3, fn. 1 and AR 1-38, 893-913.)  Respondents argue that the motion is
untimely, but the court continued the hearing and permitted Respondents to file
an opposition.  Therefore, the court
reaches the merits of the motion.  
 
Where the
issue on administrative mandamus is whether the administrative hearing was
procedurally fair, the trial court may consider evidence not presented at the
administrative hearing if the evidence addresses the petitioners [sic] claim
that he or she was denied due process or a fair hearing at that hearing. 
 
(Nasha v. City of Los Angeles (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 470,
485, citations and internal quotations omitted.)  The evidence may be relevant to the issue
whether Petitioner received a fair trial, viz., whether J.R. ever
submitted a pro hac vice application that the ALJ denied.  Accordingly, the court grants the motion and considers
the extra-record evidence only for this purpose.  
 
DISCUSSION 
 
            A.        Petitioner Received a Fair Trial
 
Petitioner
contends that he was denied a fair trial because: (1) J.R.’s purported pro
hac vice application was improperly denied; (2) The ALJ did not issue a
written decision or order explaining the grounds for denying J.R.’s purported pro
hac vice application was ever issued; 
(3) The ALJ failed
to prevent the Complainant’s counsel from asking improper leading questions of
the Complainant’s experts; (4) The ALJ allowed the admission of certain
evidence disclosed after the discovery cutoff; and (5) The ALJ denied
Petitioner’s request for a continuance after J.R. suffered a heart attack, depriving
Petitioner of “what limited assistance he had been allowed.”  (Opening Brief (“OB”) 9-12; Reply 4-7; and
Suppl. Reply 2-6.)      
 
Generally, a fair procedure requires notice reasonably calculated to
apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and an opportunity to
present their objections.  (See Doe v. University of Southern California
(2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 221, 240.)  Procedural errors,
“even if proved, are subject to a harmless error analysis.”  (Hinrichs
v. County of Orange (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 921, 928.)
 
                        1.         There is no record that J.R. ever
submitted a pro hac vice application 
 
The
certified administrative record does not contain evidence that J.R. ever filed
an application to appear pro hac vice. 
There is no file-stamped copy of an application within the
administrative record, and Petitioner presents no conformed copy with his
motion to augment the record.  There is
no discussion of a pro hac vice application in the certified hearing
transcripts.  (See AR 39-892, 914-1056.)  The ALJ did not discuss any pro hac vice application
in the administrative decision or any other written ruling in the record.  (See 2764-2817.)  Although Petitioner claims that the ALJ
denied his application, he presents no evidence to this effect.  The court even granted Petitioner leave to
conduct discovery with respect to this issue, to no avail.  (See Court Order dated April 24, 2024.)   
 
Instead,
Petitioner submits a copy of an undated and unsigned application to appear pro
hac vice in the administrative proceedings before the Board.  (AR 25-30; Archibald Decl. Exh. A.)  The fact that this document is neither dated
nor signed suggests that it was not filed. 
The certificate of service was not signed under penalty of perjury,
which is required.  (See Cal. Code of
Regs., tit. 1, § 1008.)  The certificate
of service does not state that J.R. served the application on the Board, the
OAH, or the assigned ALJ.  (AR 30.)  Further, Respondents’ counsel states that she
never received the application, and the court credits her testimony on this
issue.  (Declaration of Deputy Attorney
General Christine A. Rhee filed July 29, 2024 (“Rhee Decl.”) ¶¶ 10-11.)[1]  To the extent the presumption of proper
mailing in Evidence Code section 641 even applies in these circumstances, the
presumption has been rebutted.[2]  
 
Petitioner’s
argument appears to be based on a fallacy. 
Petitioner’s argument essentially is the ALJ must have made an
“improper[]-off-the-record determination” merely because J.R. said he would
“take steps” to resolve the issue, and there is an unsigned pro hac vice
application from J.R.’s file.  To the
contrary, it is far more likely that the absence of a ruling means that J.R.
never submitted the application, which is supported by the certified
administrative record.  Indeed,
Petitioner never explains how the ALJ’s purported off-the-record ruling was
communicated to J.R. and Petitioner, e.g., Petitioner does not present
an email from the ALJ; Petitioner does not advance any declaration stating that
there was an off-the-record conversation at which the ALJ denied the
application, etc.  Tellingly,
Petitioner does not present a declaration from J.R. or his local counsel,
Suzanne H. Mindlin, stating—under penalty of perjury—that this pro hac vice  application was filed and that they received
some communication from the ALJ denying the application.  
  
Petitioner
focuses on certain emails between J.R. and Deputy Attorney General Christine Rhee
regarding J.R.’s request to represent Petitioner, as well as emails from the
OAH staff showing that J.R. was permitted to participate in the mandatory settlement
conference even though he was not authorized to appear before OAH.  (OB 3-5; see AR 1-24, 33-38.)  Rhee was the Complaint’s attorney, not a
representative of OAH.  Regardless, none
of the emails demonstrates that J.R. ever submitted a pro hac vice
application to the OAH or the Board.  The
mere fact that J.R. was allowed to participate in the settlement conference
does not prove that he submitted a pro hac vice application.  A law license is not necessarily required to
participate in a settlement conference.       
            Finally, Petitioner failed to preserve
this issue for review.  “Before seeking
judicial review a party must show that he has made a full presentation to the
administrative agency upon all issues of the case ….”  (Edgren v. Regents of University of California (1984) 158 Cal.App.3d
515, 520.)  “Judicial review in an
administrative mandamus action brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
1094.5 is
limited to issues raised in the proceedings before the administrative agency.  Therefore, a trial court cannot properly
grant relief based on a legal theory not presented at the administrative
proceeding.”  (Dobos v. Voluntary Plan
Administrators, Inc. (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 678, 688, citations omitted.)  As discussed, there is no record that J.R.
ever submitted a pro hac vice application or that the ALJ ever denied
such an application.  Even accepting
Petitioner’s theory that there was an improper-off-the-record determination, at
no point did Petitioner object or otherwise make a record on this issue when
the ALJ referenced J.R.’s lack of authorization to practice law in
California.  (See AR 46-47, 248, 500,
796, 919-920.)  
 
In
fact, J.R. likely never submitted the unsigned pro hac vice application
because out-of-state lawyers are not permitted to appear before the Board.  Petitioner relies on California Rules of
Court, rule 9.40, that rule permits pro hac vice admission to appear “in a
court of this state.”  (See Cal. Rules
Court, rule 9.40(a).)  However, the Board
is not a court of this state; it is a quasi-judicial tribunal created by
statute.  (Gov. Code § 11370.2.)  The Administrative Procedures Act “does not,
by itself, authorize a party to a proceeding conducted by the Office of Administrative
Hearings to be represented by a person who is not an active member of the State
Bar.”  (100 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 19 (2017.)[3]  Petitioner identifies no express statutory
authorization for pro hac vice admission before the Board.  Instead, he argues that he had a due process
right to be represented by legal counsel in the
administrative proceedings.  This was not
an absolute right.  (See Borror v.
Dept. of Investment (1971) 15 Cal.App.3d 531, 540-544.)  Although Petitioner had a right to be
represented by a California-licensed attorney hired at his own expense, per
Government Code section 11509, he was not entitled to representation by an
attorney who was not licensed or otherwise permitted to practice law in
California.  (See Bus. & Prof.
Code § 6125; see also Golba v. Dick’s Sporting Goods, Inc. (2015) 238
Cal.App.4th 1251, 1261-62.)
 
Based upon the foregoing, Petitioner has not satisfied
his burden of demonstrating that J.R. ever submitted an application for pro
hac vice admission.  The court rejects
Petitioner’s speculation that the ALJ denied the application off-the-record—by
way of an unspecified communication to J.R.—merely because J.R. said he would
“take steps” to resolve the issue and there is an unsigned copy of an
application from his file that does not even bear a file stamp.  Even if the pro hac vice application
was submitted, the court finds no error in its denial, since out-of-state
lawyers are not permitted to practice before the Board.  Therefore, the petition is denied on this
basis.    
 


 
2.          
Leading questions are not a basis for a new trial
 
            Petitioner
contends that the ALJ prejudicially abused her discretion by permitting the
Complainant’s counsel to ask “improper leading questions” of one of the Board’s
experts, Dr. Cynthia Watson.  (OB
11:6-14.)  Petitioner appears to refer to
questioning of Dr. Watson with regard to progress notes and other medical
records documenting Petitioner’s NeuroRecover treatment of Patient A.  (See OB 5:14-23, citing AR
117-123.)  The transcript shows that
Complainant’s counsel asked some leading questions of Dr. Watson, and, over
Petitioner’s objection, the ALJ gave Complainant’s counsel “a little bit of
leeway” in the interest of time for certain questions. (AR 123.)  
 
            This
is not a basis for a new trial.  The
Board’s proceedings are not governed by the rules of evidence.  (See Traxler v. Board of Medical Examiners
(1933) 135 Cal.App. 37, 40-41.)  Even if
so, a trial court is may allow leading questions under certain circumstances,
especially in bench trials.  (See People
v. Williams (2008) 43 Cal.4th 584, 631; see also Evid. Code § 767.)  Finally, Petitioner does not establish
prejudice.
 
[I]t is well-settled that the improper admission or
rejection of evidence at an administrative hearing does not provide grounds for
reversal unless the error has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.  In other words, it must be reasonably probable
a more favorable result would have been reached absent the error.
 
(Thornbrough
v. Western Placer Unified School Dist. (2013) 223 Cal.App.4th 169, 200,
citations and internal quotations omitted.)  Even assuming the ALJ improperly permitted
some leading questions, Petitioner has failed to explain how the outcome of the
case would have been different if the alleged error had not been made.  Accordingly, Petitioner does not prove a prejudicial
abuse of discretion or a denial of a fair trial.  
 
3.         There is no record that evidence was
disclosed after the discovery cut-off 
 
Petitioner contends that the admission of evidence disclosed
after the discovery deadline in the PHC Order constituted prejudicial abuse of
discretion.  (OB 11- 12.)  As support, Petitioner cites to his objection
to the admission of the Complainant’s Exhibit 21, which include the redacted
and unredacted vaccination exemption forms Petitioner signed for Patients C, D,
E, and F.  (See AR 284-285, 2624-2638.)  Pursuant to the PHC Order, the discovery
deadline was August 10, 2022.  (AR
1185.)  Petitioner cites no evidence in
the record that the documents contained in Exhibit 21 were first provided to
him after August 10, 2022.[4]  Nor does Petitioner show that he was
prejudiced by any late disclosure.  The authenticity
of Exhibit 21, which includes vaccination exemptions signed by Petitioner, is
not subject to reasonable dispute.   Finally, Petitioner never sought a continuance
on this basis, which would have been the remedy for any late disclosure.  (See AR 284-285.)  Therefore, the petition is denied on this
ground.    
            4.         The ALJ did not abuse her discretion in
denying a continuance             
 
Finally,
Petitioner contends that he was deprived a fair trial when the ALJ denied his
oral motion to continue the final day of the administrative hearing because of
a serious health condition of J.R.  (OB
12.)  On December 5, 2022, J.R. emailed
Deputy Attorney General Rhee and informed her that he had suffered a heart
attack that required a medical operation; he had been advised by his doctor to
avoid stress for a few weeks; and he was concerned that attending the
administrative hearing on December 19, 2022, could jeopardize his health.  For those reasons, J.R. requested that the
Complainant stipulate to continue the hearing to January or February 2023.  (AR 893.) 
On December 6, 2022, Rhee informed J.R. that the Complainant would not
stipulate to a continuance because J.R. was not counsel-of-record.  (AR 906.) 

 
Petitioner
raised this issue with the ALJ on December 19, 2022, which was the final day of
the hearing.  Petitioner orally moved for
a continuance on the grounds that his ability to consult with J.R. was impacted
“because of his health condition, which was made known to Ms. Rhee weeks
ago.”  (AR 920.)  The ALJ denied the motion on the grounds
that, while Petitioner was “consulting” with J.R., he was representing himself
in the administrative proceedings and, as a result, J.R.’s participation was
not essential to the proceedings.  (AR
921.)  
 
Government
Code section 11524 governs Petitioner’s request for a continuance and provides,
in pertinent part, as follows: 
 
(a) The
agency may grant continuances. When an administrative law judge of the Office
of Administrative Hearings has been assigned to the hearing, no continuance may
be granted except by him or her or by the presiding judge of the appropriate
regional office of the Office of Administrative Hearings, for good cause shown.
 
(b) When
seeking a continuance, a party shall apply for the continuance within 10
working days following the time the party discovered or reasonably should have
discovered the event or occurrence which establishes the good cause for the
continuance….
 
(c) In
the event that an application for a continuance by a party is denied by an
administrative law judge of the Office of Administrative Hearings, and the
party seeks judicial review thereof, the party shall, within 10 working days of
the denial, make application for appropriate judicial relief in the superior
court or be barred from judicial review thereof as a matter of
jurisdiction….
 
(Gov. Code § 11524, emphasis added.)  
 
            Here,
Petitioner moved for a continuance on December 19, 2022, which was more than 10
days after he learned of J.R.’s heart attack. 
Petitioner also did not seek judicial review of the denial of the motion
within 10 working days.  Accordingly, for
both reasons, Petitioner is procedurally barred from challenging the ALJ’s
denial of the continuance motion.  In the
alternative, Petitioner does not demonstrate any prejudicial abuse of
discretion in the ALJ’s decision to deny a continuance.  As discussed, J.R. was not Petitioner’s
counsel, and Petitioner does not demonstrate, with a discussion of the record,
that there is any reasonable possibility the case would have been different had
J.R. been available to advise Petitioner. 
Therefore, the petition is denied on this ground.
 
            B.        The Weight of the Evidence Supports the
Administrative Findings     
 
In this
administrative writ proceeding, Petitioner bears the burden of proof to
demonstrate, by citation to the administrative record, that the weight of the
evidence does not support the administrative findings.  (Strumsky
v. San Diego County Employees Retirement Assn. (1974) 11 Cal.3d 28, 32; Steele v. Los Angeles County Civil Service Commission (1958) 166
Cal.App.2d 129, 137.)  Significantly, Petitioner “must identify (with
citations to the record) the factual findings made by the board that he or she
is challenging and demonstrate (with citations to the record) why those factual
findings were against the weight of the evidence.”  (Shenouda
v. Veterinary Medical Bd. (2018)
27 Cal.App.5th 500, 513.)  A
reviewing court “will not act as counsel for either party to an appeal and will
not assume the task of initiating and prosecuting a search of the record for
any purpose of discovering errors not pointed out in the briefs.” (Fox v. Erickson (1950) 99 Cal.App.2d
740, 742.)  “When an appellant fails to
raise a point, or asserts it but fails to support it with reasoned argument and
citations to authority, we treat the point as waived.”  (Nelson v. Avondale HOA (2009) 172
Cal.App.4th 857, 862-863.)
 
Here,
in his writ briefing, Petitioner does not challenge nearly all the
administrative findings and legal conclusions in the final administrative
decision.  (See AR 2764-2817.)  Nor could Petitioner successfully do so.  Based on extensive expert testimony of Dr.
Watson and supporting medical records, the Board found that Petitioner
committed gross negligence “for failing to gradually reduce Patient A’s
antidepressant and benzodiazepine use over several weeks, failing to recognize
that Patient A was suffering rebound withdrawal syndrome, and failing to
provide appropriate treatment after Patient A’s symptoms returned.”  (AR 2813.) 
Based on expert testimony of Dr. Blumberg and supporting medical
records, the Board found that Petitioner committed gross negligence by issuing
vaccination exemptions to Patients C, D, E, and F for “unsupported reasons”
and/or failing to document proper contraindications supporting the exemptions.  (Ibid.) 
The Board also found that Petitioner committed repeated negligent acts
for the care and treatment of Patients A, C, D, E, and F, as noted above, and
for inadequate record keeping for Patient B. (AR 2813-2814.)  
 
These
findings are supported by extensive testimony and written reports of two
qualified expert witnesses, as well as the medical records of the six patients,
Petitioner’s written summaries of care, and the transcript of Petitioner’s
interview with the Board.  (See e.g. AR
73-209, 922-996, 250-367, 1405-1409, 1876-1880.)  In contrast, Petitioner did not present any
expert testimony in defense.  (See AR
2766-2804.)  The Board weighed the
credibility of Dr. Watson, Dr. Blumberg, and Petitioner, and determined that
the experts were more reliable than Petitioner in that they “testified credibly
and in a forthright manner with sound reasoning underlying their opinions,” had
extensive knowledge regarding the relevant standard of care, and were qualified
in their respective fields. (AR 2809-2810.)
 


 
Petitioner
argues that Dr. Watson and Dr. Blumberg did not accurately define the phrase
“standard of care.”  (OB 6-7, fn. 6, 7
and OB 14:16-22.)  Petitioner also argues
that Dr. Watson was not a qualified expert because “she … could not articulate
her own opinions without substantial assistance.”  (OB 14:16-22, citing AR 117-118,
141-142.)  Exercising its independent
judgment on the record, the court finds these arguments unpersuasive.  When fully considered, the hearing
transcripts and expert reports show that Dr. Watson and Dr. Blumberg understood
the applicable standards of care, both with respect to gross negligence and
simple negligence.  (See e.g. AR 1405-1409,
1876-1880 [reports]; AR 140-143, 201, 274, 308-309 [hearing transcripts]; see
also Gore v. Board of Medical Quality Assurance (1980) 110 Cal.App 3d 184,
197–98 [defining gross negligence and extreme departure from standard of care
and contrasting with ordinary negligence]; and Mann v. Cracchiolo (1985)
38 Cal.3d 18, 36 [defining standard of care].) 
Dr. Watson’s report and expert testimony also refute Petitioner’s
contention that she could not articulate her expert opinion without
“substantial assistance” from Complainant’s counsel.  (AR 1405-1409, 140-143, 201.)  Finally, contrary to Petitioner’s assertion,
Dr. Blumberg credibly explained why he found an extreme departure from the
standard of care with respect to Patient F, including because there is no
condition or circumstance that would justify the issuance of a permanent
vaccine exemption for all childhood vaccines. 
(See AR 2812, 308-313.)  
 
Based on the
foregoing, the court concludes that the weight of the evidence supports the
administrative findings.  Therefore, the
petition for writ of mandate is denied on this basis.    
 
C.        The Propriety of the Penalty
 
Petitioner
contends that license revocation was an excessive penalty because it was “not
necessary to protect the public nor was it calculated toward Dr. Humiston’s
rehabilitation.”  (OB 15:8-12; see
also OB 13:4-14:5.)  The court has limited authority to reconsider the penalty.  “The propriety of a penalty imposed by an
administrative agency is a matter vested in the discretion of the agency, and
its decision may not be disturbed unless there has been a manifest abuse of
discretion.”  (Williamson v. Board of Medical Quality Assurance (1990) 217
Cal.App.3d 1343, 1347.)  The court may
not exercise its own judgment or substitute its own discretion for that of the
Board.  (See Bryce v. Board of
Medical Quality Assurance (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 1471, 1474.) “If reasonable minds may
differ with regard to the appropriate disciplinary action, there is no abuse of
discretion.” (County of Los Angeles v.
Civil Service Commission (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 620, 634.)
 
In evaluating the
propriety of the penalty, the court must consider the purpose of the State
Medical Practice Act, which is “to
assure the high quality of medical practice; in other words, to keep
unqualified and undesirable persons and those guilty of unprofessional conduct
out of the medical profession.”  (Shea v. Board of Medical Examiners (1978)
81 Cal.App.3d 564, 574.)  
 
The revocation or
suspension of a license is not penal, but rather, the Legislature has provided
for such to protect the life, health and welfare of the people at large and to
set up a plan whereby those who practice medicine will have the qualifications
which will 


 
prevent, as far as
possible, the evils which could result from ignorance or incompetency or a lack
of honesty and integrity. 
 
(Furnish v. Board
of Medical Examiners (1957) 149 Cal.App.2d 326, 331.)  
 
Petitioner does
not show any manifest abuse of discretion in the Board’s selection of
penalty.  In determining the penalty, the
Board considered its Disciplinary Guidelines, which recommended a minimum of
five years of probation to a maximum of revocation for Petitioner. (AR 2808-2809,
1394.)  The Board found that Petitioner
engaged in serious acts of professional misconduct, particularly with respect
to the extreme departures from the standard of care in his treatment of
Patients A, C, D, E, and F.  The Board
considered Petitioner’s disciplinary history with the Board, his failure to
take responsibility for his negligent acts in either the instant case or his
prior disciplinary case, and his lack of willingness to undertake Board-ordered
rehabilitation, as evidenced by his testimony that he had no intention of
moving back to California. (AR 2814- 2815.)  Because Petitioner had no intention of living
in California again, he “would not be able to abide by any probationary terms,”
which was an issue  because Petitioner
“owns and operates medical clinics” in California.  (Ibid.)  Although Petitioner cites several statements
suggesting that he admitted to incomplete medical records, Petitioner has not
provided a comprehensive discussion of the record and has not shown, by record
citation, that he has taken responsibility for the more serious acts of gross
negligence found by the Board with respect to Patients A, C, D, E, and F.  (See OB 14:4-15, citing AR 677-688,
693, 737-738, 584-585, 716-717.)  Therefore,
the court finds that the penalty of revocation does not constitute a manifest
abuse of discretion.
