And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is about a motion filed by Artesia Acquisition Company, LLC (Artesia) seeking an order requiring the Jeanne Eve McDonald Revocable Trust (the Trust) to pay half of the amount Artesia paid ($517,581.46) to satisfy a judgment. The judgment was a result of a writ of mandate granted to Riverpark Coalition and LA Waterkeeper (Petitioners) to set aside an approval of a project by the City of Long Beach (Respondent). The court ordered the Real Parties in Interest, including Artesia, to pay attorneys' fees and costs in the total amount of $469,267.19. Artesia paid the full amount, but now seeks to have the Trust pay half. The Judge notes that the City of Long Beach is entitled to notice of the motion because it may be impacted by the court's decision on how to apportion the judgment amount. The Judge has not made a tentative ruling on the motion.
