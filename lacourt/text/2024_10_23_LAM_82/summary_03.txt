```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge will consider the Petitioner's declaration, which responds to extra-record evidence, although the court would reach the same decision without this declaration. The judge also notes that the proof of service for the Notice of Additional Local Counsel suffers from defects, similar to those found in the Petitioner's purported pro hac vice application. The judge cites an opinion by the Attorney General, which is entitled to great weight, to support the court's decision. Additionally, the judge notes that the documents contained in Exhibit 21 were provided in discovery to the Petitioner's then counsel and does not need to rely on the Petitioner's declaration to rule on the petition.
