Case Number: 20STCV40739
Judge: [Unknown]
Hearing Date: November 7, 2024
Department: E
Trial Date: March 3, 2025

Case Name: Rodolfo Zarate Blanco v. Kirstie Lee Walker; AT&T Corporation; Pacific Bell Telephone Company; and Does 1-10

Tentative Ruling:

**Motion to Quash/Motion for Protective Order**

* Moving Party: Defendants Pacific Bell Telephone Company and Kirstie Lee Walker
* Responding Party: Plaintiff Rodolfo Zarate Blanco

**Relief Requested**

* Quash the deposition notice and stay the deposition of Pacific Bell Telephone Company employee Tim States
* Obtain a protective order to limit the scope of the deposition and document production to questions and documents related to issues of causation, such as speed, damage to the vehicles, injuries (received and perceived), and conversations at the scene about the nature of the impact and injuries
* Monetary sanctions against Mr. Raymond Feldman, Esq. and the Law Offices of John C. Ye, APLC in the amount of $1,810.00

**Arguments**

* Defendants argue that the deposition of Tim States should be limited to issues of causation, as any questions related to liability for the accident or negligent entrustment, hiring, or retention are irrelevant and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence
* Defendants claim that the admission of liability filed on June 13, 2023, does not admit that Plaintiff was in the vehicle
* Plaintiff argues that the admission of liability concedes that Plaintiff was a passenger in the truck when Defendants rearended it

**Good Cause**

* The Court finds that Defendants have not demonstrated good cause for the relief requested, as the motion does not specify which categories of documents requested in the deposition notice fall within the scope of the proposed protective order
* The Court notes that the moving papers do not provide any legal authority for the proposition that the Court is bound by a previous minute order pertaining to discovery propounded on a different individual

**Facts**

* The accident occurred on November 1, 2018
* Plaintiff alleges that he was a passenger in a vehicle that was struck by Defendants
* Defendants admit to liability for the accident, but do not admit that the accident caused each of the injuries Plaintiff alleges were caused by the accident
* The deposition notice seeks to produce 12 categories of documents, including employee personnel files, cellphone records, and driver's licenses
* The parties have had a mediation scheduled for November 5, 2024, which has been on calendar since July 10, 2023
