And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court will hear argument on Plaintiff Guiseppe Fiorella's motion to vacate the dismissal of their complaint against Defendant City of Glendale. The motion is based on CCP ยง 473(b), which allows for relief from default judgments or dismissals due to attorney fault. Plaintiff's counsel mistakenly calendared the 5/13/2024 Case Management Conference and Order to Show Cause for 9/13/2024 instead of 5/13/2024, which led to the dismissal of the complaint.

The Court notes that one of the requirements for relief under CCP ยง 473(b) is the attorney affidavit of fault, and that the Keshishian Declaration did not contain a proof of service, which appears to be a fatal defect for Plaintiff's motion. The Court will also expect Plaintiff to address the additional service issues pointed out in the "Procedural Analysis" section and whether or not this application was in proper form.
