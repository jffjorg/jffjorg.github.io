And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a Judge regarding a future Court Hearing. The case is a Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty cause of action filed by Plaintiff Wendy Lucia Garcia Islas against Defendant American Honda Motor Co. and Level Up Motors Operating, LLC. The Defendant filed a motion to compel arbitration on February 29, 2024, citing previous cases such as Felisilda v. FCA LLC. However, the court finds that the Defendant's contention of equitable estoppel is unavailing and denies the motion to compel arbitration. The court has reviewed several previous cases, including Ford Motor Warranty Cases, Kielar v. Superior Court of Placer County, Montemayor v. Ford Motor Co., Yeh v. Superior Court of Contra Costa Ctny., and Davis v. Nissan North America Inc., and finds that they are better reasoned than Felisilda v. FCA LLC. The Defendant is ordered to give notice of the court's decision.
