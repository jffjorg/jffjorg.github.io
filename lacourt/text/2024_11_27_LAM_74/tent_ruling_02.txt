 Case Number:  21STCV33318    Hearing Date:   November 27, 2024    Dept:  74 Torres v.
Marapao
Defendant Sydney Marapao’s Motion
for Attorneys’ Fees.
 
BACKGROUND  
            Plaintiff
David Torres, Jr (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against defendant Sydney Marapao
(Defendant) alleging fraud and breach of contract.  Defendant filed a cross-complaint primarily
alleging, in relevant part, breach of a promissory note.  Both the complaint and cross-complaint
disputed the purchase of Gemini Home Health, Inc. 
            On
March 8, 2024, Judgement was entered against Plaintiff on the Complaint and for
Defendant on the cross-complaint. 
            On
May 13, 2024, Defendant filed his unopposed motion for attorneys’ fees against cross-defendant
Rex Rodriguez. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD 
The
California Code of Civil Procedure provides for attorneys’ fees to the
prevailing party in a contract action only if the contract included an
attorneys’ fees provision.  (Cal. Civ.
Proc. § 1717.)  The “prevailing party” is
the party who obtained grater relief in the action.  (Cal. Civ. Proc. § 1717(b)(1).)
            Verified
billing invoices are prima facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and
services listed were necessarily incurred.  (See Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167
Cal.App.3d 677, 682.)  Counsel has the
burden of providing the reasonable number of hours devoted to the litigation,
through declarations, or redacted or unredacted timesheets or billing
records.  (Concepcion v. Amscan
Holdings, Inc. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 1309, 1325.)  “[T]he verified time statements of the
attorneys, as officers of the court, are entitled to credence in the absence of
a clear indication the records are erroneous.” (Horsford v. Board of
Trustees of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 396.)  
The
determination of reasonable amount of attorney fees is within the sound
discretion of trial courts.  (PLCM
Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.)
 
DISCUSSION
            Defendant
is entitled to attorney fees based on the Attorneys’ Fees and Costs provision
of the Promissory Note.  The provision
states, in relevant part:
Promissors agree that if this Note is placed in the hands of
an attorney for collection, Promissors shall pay reasonable costs and
attorneys’ fees.  
 
Defendant was the prevailing
party.  (Richardson Decl., Ex. “A.”)  Defendant alleges that the claims under the
complaint were “part and parcel” to the cross-complaint.  Rodriguez does not dispute Defendant’s
allegation. 
            Defendant
requests a total of $95,615.00 in attorneys’ fees for two attorneys.  Attorney Abe Marapao’s hourly rate is $500.00,
and he spent 99.20 hours handling the matter. 
(Marapao Decl., ¶¶ 5, 7.) 
Additionally, Marapao paid an appearance attorney to cover an appearance
and attorney Cameron Gilbert to assist in preparing demurrers in the matter,
for a total of an additional $2,185.00. 
(Marapao Decl., ¶ 7.)  Defendant
also hired attorney Danton Richardson. Richardson’s hourly rate is $400.00 an
hour and he spent 114.1 hours handling the matter.  (Richardson Decl., ¶ 7, 9.)  Both Marapao and Richardson include their billing
records as exhibits in support of Marapao’s motion.  (Mot., Ex. “C”, Ex. “D.”)  Rodriguez has not opposed the award of
attorneys’ fees.  The court finds the
amounts reasonable. 
            
CONCLUSION
            The
court grants defendant’s motion for attorneys’ fees in the amount of $95,615. 
            Defendant
to give notice.
