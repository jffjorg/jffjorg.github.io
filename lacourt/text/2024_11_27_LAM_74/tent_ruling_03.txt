 Case Number:  23STCV29722    Hearing Date:   November 27, 2024    Dept:  74 Defendant American Honda Motor Co.’s
Motion to Compel Arbitration
 
BACKGROUND  
            This
motion arises out of a Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty cause of action. 
            Plaintiff
Wendy Lucia Garcia Islas (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against defendant
American Honda Motor Company (AHM) and Level Up Motors Operating, LLC. 
AHM
filed this motion to compel arbitration on February 29, 2024. AMH aims to
compel arbitration under the Court of Appeal, Third District’s decision in Felisilda
v. FCA LLC (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 486 (Felisilda). Based on Ford
Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324 rev. granted S279969 (July
19, 2023); Kielar v. Superior Court of Placer County (2023) 94
Cal.App.5th 614 rev. granted S281937 (Oct. 25, 2023); Montemayor v. Ford
Motor Co. (2023) 92 Cal.App.5th 958 rev. granted S281237 (Sept. 20, 2023); Yeh
v. Superior Court of Contra Costa Ctny. (2023) 95 Cal.App.5th 264 rev.
granted S282228 (Nov. 15, 2023); and Davis v. Nissan North America Inc
(2024) 100 Cal.App.5th 825 rev. granted S284697 (May 29, 2024) – all of which
the court deems better reasoned than Felisilda v. FCA US LLC (2020) 53
Cal.App.5th 486 – the court finds AHM’s equitable estoppel contention
unavailing. (Auto Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court of Santa Clara County
(1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 455.)
            The
court denies the motion to compel arbitration.
            Defendant shall give notice.
