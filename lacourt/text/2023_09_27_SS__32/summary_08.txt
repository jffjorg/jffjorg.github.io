And here is the English text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion to compel answer at deposition and an order for manner of resuming deposition. The motion was brought by the Plaintiff, Martha Cruz Aguilar Cardenas, against the Defendant, Jonathan Anthony Ayala. The issue arose during a remote videotaped deposition of the Defendant on April 24, 2023, when technical difficulties caused the connection to freeze multiple times. The Plaintiff moves for an order compelling the Defendant to complete the deposition in person and to provide a nonverbal answer by placing an "x" on a map to indicate where the accident occurred.

The Judge has considered the relevant laws and statutes, including Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.610, 2025.420, and 2025.310, as well as the case of Emerson Electric Co. v. Superior Court (1997). The Court finds good cause to order the Defendant to appear at a deposition in person at a location mutually agreeable to the parties, citing the potential for unwarranted annoyance and undue burden and expense if the deposition were to continue remotely. The Court grants the Plaintiff's motion to compel and orders the Defendant to complete the deposition in person and to provide a nonverbal answer regarding the placement on the map of the location of the accident.
