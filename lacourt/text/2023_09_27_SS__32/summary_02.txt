And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge is considering the motion to dismiss filed by LADWP and has tentatively ruled that the injury allegedly caused by LADWP did not occur on "unimproved public property" as required by Government Code § 831.2. The judge notes that the Plaintiffs' Complaint alleges that the injury occurred in "man-made pools with water supplied by pipe", which suggests that the property was not in its natural state. The judge also points out that LADWP may still have immunity under Government Code § 855.4(a) or (b) and will consider this further. Finally, the judge notes that Brown's Supply does not have standing to oppose LADWP's motion and therefore its arguments will not be considered.
