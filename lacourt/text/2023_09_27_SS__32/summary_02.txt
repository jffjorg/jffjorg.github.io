And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge is considering the motion to dismiss filed by LADWP and has tentatively ruled that the injury allegedly caused by LADWP did not occur on "unimproved public property" as required by Government Code § 831.2. The judge notes that the Plaintiffs' Complaint alleges that the injury occurred in "man-made pools with water supplied by pipe", which suggests that the property was not in its natural state. The judge also points out that LADWP may still have immunity under Government Code § 855.4(a) or (b) and will consider this further. Finally, the judge notes that Brown's Supply does not have standing to oppose LADWP's motion and therefore its arguments will not be considered.

## English Summary

The judge is considering a motion for summary judgment filed by LADWP, who is seeking to avoid liability for an injury. 

LADWP argues that they are immune from liability under Government Code § 831.2, which protects public entities from liability for injuries caused by natural conditions on unimproved public property. 

However, the judge notes that the plaintiff's complaint alleges the injury occurred in "man-made pools," suggesting that the property may not be considered "unimproved" and thus, LADWP may not be entitled to immunity under § 831.2.

The judge also acknowledges LADWP's argument for immunity under other sections of the Government Code, but does not explicitly rule on that point in this tentative ruling.

And here is the English text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the issue of whether LADWP and Brown's Supply are entitled to immunity from liability for an alleged injury that occurred in "man-made pools with water supplied by pipe". The judge notes that the Plaintiffs claim the injury occurred in these pools, rather than on "unimproved public property", which would be subject to absolute immunity under Government Code section 831.2. The judge also references Government Code section 855.4, which provides for immunity in certain circumstances. The judge concludes that consideration of Brown's Supply's arguments does not change the Court's decisions and that LADWP may qualify for immunity under either section 831.2 or 855.4.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a court case involving the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) and multiple plaintiffs. The plaintiffs allege that they were injured in man-made pools with water supplied by pipe, which is not considered "unimproved public property" under Government Code § 831.2. The LADWP argues that it is immune from liability under this section, as well as under section 855.4(a) or (b). The judge notes that the plaintiffs' complaint does not support a claim of liability against the LADWP, as the injury did not occur on unimproved public property. Additionally, the judge finds that Brown's Supply, which opposes the LADWP's motion, does not have standing to do so. The judge's ruling is based on previous case law, including City of Santa Cruz, Goddard v. Department of Fish and Wildlife, and County of San Mateo v. Superior Court.
