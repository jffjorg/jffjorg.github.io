[1] Government Code
§ 831.2 states,
“Neither a public entity nor a public employee is liable for an injury caused
by a natural condition of any unimproved public property, including but not
limited to any natural condition of any lake, stream, bay, river or
beach.”  “The immunity is absolute.”  (City of Santa Cruz,
supra, 198 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004; see also Goddard v. Department of Fish and
Wildlife (2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 350, 360 [Immunity under section 831.2 is “absolute and
applies regardless of whether the public entity had knowledge of the dangerous
condition or failed to give warning.”].) A property is not “unimproved” if
there is some form of physical change in the condition of the property. (County of San
Mateo v. Superior Court (2017) 13 Cal.App.5th 724, 732; see Alana M. v. State of California (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 1482,
1491 [“[t]here is no evidence of any artificial physical change in the
condition of the tree that injured Alana or of the land within 24 feet of the
tree.”].)
 
Here,
Plaintiffs allege throughout their Complaint that the injury took place in
“man-made pools with water supplied by pipe.” (Complaint ¶ 19.) Therefore,
based on the face of the complaint, the injury does not appear to have taken
place on “unimproved public property.” 
 


[2] A
defendant may qualify for immunity under either section 855.4(a) or (b). (Greenwood,
supra, 89 Cal.App.5th at 865.)

argues that Brown’s Supply does not have standing to oppose LADWP’s motion. Consideration
of Brown’s Supply’s arguments does not change the Court’s decisions herein.
