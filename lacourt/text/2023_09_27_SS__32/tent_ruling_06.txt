MOTION
 
Defendant The Colony Royal Oaks Homeowner’s Association (“Defendant”)
demurs to the first amended complaint filed by Plaintiffs Tatyana Goldshteyn
and Dina Goldshteyn (“Plaintiffs”). The demurrer is opposed.
 
BACKGROUND
 
            The first
amended complaint (FAC) alleges that on September 2, 2020, a tree owned,
maintained, and controlled by Defendant impacted Plaintiffs’ vehicle and caused
a collision. The FAC alleges causes of action for negligence and premises
liability and was brought against the City of Los Angeles, County of Los
Angeles, and Does 1 to 50. On May 26, 2023, Plaintiffs added Defendant to the
FAC as Doe 1. 
 
            Defendant
now demurs arguing that the negligence and premises liability causes of action
fail to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and are
uncertain. Plaintiffs oppose. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
“The primary function of a pleading is to give the other
party notice so that it may prepare its case [citation], and a defect in a
pleading that otherwise properly notifies a party cannot be said to affect
substantial rights.” (Harris v. City of Santa Monica (2013) 56 Cal.4th
203, 240.) “A demurrer tests
the legal sufficiency of the factual allegations in a complaint.” (Ivanoff
v. Bank of America, N.A. (2017)
9 Cal.App.5th 719, 725.) It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form
or content of the opposing party's pleading (complaint, answer or
cross-complaint).  (Code Civ. Proc. §§
422.10, 589; see Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th
968, 994.)  It is not the function of the
demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for purposes of
the ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are assumed to
be true.  (Donabedian, 116
Cal.App.4th at 994.)
 
A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the
face of the pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading that
are judicially noticeable.  (Blank v.
Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian, supra, 116 Cal.App.4th
at 994.)  No other extrinsic evidence can
be considered.  (Ion Equip. Corp. v.
Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 881 [error for court to consider facts
asserted in memorandum supporting demurrer]; see also Afuso v. United States
Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862 [disapproved on other
grounds in Moradi-Shalal v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d
287] [error to consider contents of release not part of court record].) A
demurrer can be utilized where the “face of the complaint” itself is incomplete
or discloses some defense that would bar recovery.  (Guardian North Bay, Inc. v. Superior
Court (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 963, 971-72.) 

 
            Finally,
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41 requires that “[b]efore
filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party shall meet and
confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is
subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be
reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).) The parties are to meet and confer at least
five days before the date the responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41, subd. (a)(2).) Thereafter, the demurring party shall file and serve a
declaration detailing their meet and confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41, subd. (a)(3).)
 
MEET AND CONFER
 
            According
to the declaration of Lawrence Walter, counsel for Defendant did not attempt to
meet and confer in person or by telephone as required, but rather sent an email
to Plaintiff’s counsel. In any event, “[a] determination by the court that the
meet and confer process was insufficient shall not be grounds to overrule or
sustain a demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a)(4).)
 
ANALYSIS
 
Negligence
and Premises Liability 
 
“The elements of
a cause of action for negligence are well established. They are (a) a legal
duty to use due care; (b) a breach of such legal duty; [and] (c) the breach as
the¿proximate or legal cause of the resulting injury.” (Ladd v. County of
San Mateo (1996) 12 Cal.4th 913, 917, internal quotations omitted.) “The
first element, duty, may be imposed by law, be assumed by the defendant, or
exist by virtue of a special relationship.” (Doe v. United States Youth
Soccer Assn., Inc. (2017) 8 Cal.App.5th 1118, 1128, internal quotations
omitted.) “[T]he existence of a duty is a question of law for the court.” (Ky.
Fried Chicken of Cal. v. Superior Court (1997) 14 Cal.4th 814, 819.) 
 
The elements of premises liability are duty, breach, causation of the
injury, and damages. (Ortega v. Kmart Corp. (2001) 26 Cal. 4th 1200,
1205.)¿¿ 
 
“The owner of premises is under a duty to exercise ordinary care in
the management of such premises in order to avoid exposing persons to an
unreasonable risk of harm. A failure to fulfill this duty is negligence.” (Brooks
v. Eugene Burger Management Corp. (1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 1611, 1619.)¿“[P]roperty
owners are liable for injuries on land they own, possess, or control. But . . .
the phrase own, possess, or control is stated in the alternative. A defendant
need not own, possess and control property in order to be held liable; control
alone is sufficient.” (Alcaraz v. Vece (1997) 14 Cal.4th1149, 1162.)
Additionally, this duty applies to natural conditions on the land. (Sprecher v. Adamson Companies (1981) 30 Cal.3d 358, 371.)
 
The FAC alleges: 
 
On September 2, 2020, Plaintiff TATYANA
GOLDSHTEYN operated a certain 2019 Toyota Camry on Sepulveda Blvd. at or near
Valley Meadow Rd. in Sherman Oaks, CA 91436. At the previously alleged time and
place, Plaintiff, DINA GOLDSHTEYN was a passenger in Plaintiff, TATYANA
GOLDSHTEYN's vehicle. At the previously alleged time and place, when Plaintiff
was driving on Sepulveda Blvd., a large tree, owned, maintained, controlled by
Defendants, CITY OF LOS ANGELES, COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES, and DOES I to 50,
inclusive, impacted Plaintiffs vehicle causing the subject collision. As a
proximate result of the negligence of Defendants CITY OF LOS ANGELES, COUNTY OF
LOS ANGELES, and DOES 1-50, inclusive, and each of them, and the resulting
incident, Plaintiffs were rendered sick, sore, lame, hurt, injured and were
damaged. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants, and each of them, negligently
created and/or otherwise gave rise to the dangerous condition of public
property and/or had actual and/or constructive knowledge of the existence of
the dangerous condition, namely a defective and poorly maintained tree existing
over a public roadway. Plaintiffs additionally allege, that Defendants knew or,
in the exercise of reasonable care and diligence, should have known that an
injury, such as the one sustained by Plaintiffs, would occur as a result of the
dangerous condition existing on public property. 
 
Here, Plaintiffs have set forth sufficient facts to state a claim for negligence
and premises liability. The FAC alleges Doe 1 (as well as the City and County
of Los Angeles) owned, maintained, and controlled the tree, which impacted
Plaintiffs’ vehicle, and as a proximate result of Doe 1’s negligence,
Plaintiffs were injured. The FAC further alleges that each defendant
negligently created the dangerous condition and had actual or constructive
knowledge of it. The FAC sufficiently alleges facts constituting the causes of
action for negligence and premises liability. Defendant’s primary argument is
that the Homeowner’s Association is located in Encino and the incident is
alleged to have occurred in Sherman Oaks. However, it is not the function of a
demurrer to resolve the truthfulness of the complaint, and all factual
allegations are assumed to be true. It is sufficient that Plaintiffs have
alleged facts to constitute the alleged causes of action. 
 
Uncertainty 
 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 430.10(f) provides that a pleading is uncertain if it is ambiguous and
unintelligible. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10(f).) “A demurrer for uncertainty is
strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain,
because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury
v. Maly’s of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) “The
objection of uncertainty does not go to the failure to allege sufficient
facts.” (Brea v. McGlashan (1934) 3 Cal.App.2d 454, 459.)  “It goes
to the doubt as to what the pleader means by the facts alleged.” (Id.)
“Such a demurrer should not be sustained where the allegations of the complaint
are sufficiently clear to apprise the defendant of the issues which he is to
meet.” (People v. Lim (1941) 18 Cal.2d 872, 882.)      
 
Here, Plaintiffs have alleged
that a tree fell on their car while driving on Sepulveda Blvd. at
or near Valley Meadow Rd. in Sherman Oaks, CA 91436. Based on the FAC,
Defendant can reasonably infer that Plaintiffs are alleging that Defendant
owned, maintained, or controlled the tree. Therefore, one can reasonable
determine what the complaint is alleging and where the incident allegedly took
place, as the FAC states generally two cross-streets. The FAC is therefore not
fatally uncertain.
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Accordingly,
Defendant’s demurrer to the complaint is OVERRULED.
 
            Defendant
shall file a responsive pleading within 30 days.
 
            Defendant
shall give notice of the Court’s order and file a proof of service of such.
