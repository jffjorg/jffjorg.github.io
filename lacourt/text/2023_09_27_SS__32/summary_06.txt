And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling addresses a demurrer filed by the defendant, The Colony Royal Oaks Homeowner's Association, to the first amended complaint (FAC) filed by plaintiffs Tatyana Goldshteyn and Dina Goldshteyn. The demurrer argues that the FAC fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and is uncertain. The court finds that the FAC sufficiently alleges facts to state a claim for negligence and premises liability, and that the demurrer is overruled. The court also finds that the meet and confer requirement did not occur, but notes that this does not affect the ruling on the demurrer.
