And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling addresses a demurrer filed by the defendant, The Colony Royal Oaks Homeowner's Association, to the first amended complaint (FAC) filed by plaintiffs Tatyana Goldshteyn and Dina Goldshteyn. The demurrer argues that the FAC fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and is uncertain. The court finds that the FAC sufficiently alleges facts to state a claim for negligence and premises liability, and that the demurrer is overruled. The court also finds that the meet and confer requirement did not occur, but notes that this does not affect the ruling on the demurrer.

This tentative ruling is for a hearing on September 27, 2023, in Department 32. The case number is 21STCV31722. The defendant, The Colony Royal Oaks Homeowner’s Association, has demurred to the first amended complaint filed by the plaintiffs, Tatyana Goldshteyn and Dina Goldshteyn. The demurrer is disputed.

The background of the case is that on September 2, 2020, a tree owned, maintained, and controlled by the Defendant impacted Plaintiffs’ vehicle and caused a collision. The first amended complaint alleges causes of action for negligence and premises liability and was brought against the City of Los Angeles, County of Los Angeles, and Does 1 to 50. On May 26, 2023, Plaintiffs added Defendant to the FAC as Doe 1.

The legal standard for a demurrer is that it tests the legal sufficiency of the factual allegations in a complaint and raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or content of the opposing party's pleading. It is not the function of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the complaint, and for purposes of the ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are assumed to be true.

The ruling is that Defendant’s demurrer to the complaint is OVERRULED. Defendant shall file a responsive pleading within 30 days and give notice of the Court’s order.

The judge encourages the parties to meet and confer concerning this tentative ruling to determine if a resolution may be reached. If the parties are unable to reach a resolution and a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling, the party must send an email to the Court at sscdept32@lacourt.org indicating that party’s intention to submit. If the Court does not receive an email indicating the parties are submitting on this tentative ruling and there are no appearances at the hearing, the Court may place the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.
