## English Summary

The judge tentatively ruled to deny the defendant, John T. Tsai's, motion for summary judgment. Tsai argued he shouldn't be held liable because he doesn't own the property where the plaintiff, Sanjuanita Rios, allegedly tripped and fell. 

However, the judge determined that ownership isn't the only factor in determining liability for premises liability.  Control over the property is also crucial.  Since Tsai failed to provide evidence showing he didn't have control over the property, the judge denied his motion for summary judgment.  The case will proceed to trial.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for summary judgment filed by defendant John T. Tsai. The motion was filed in a case where plaintiff Sanjuanita Rios sued Tsai and 1815 E. Workman, LLC for negligence and premises liability. The incident in question occurred on March 28, 2019, when Rios allegedly tripped over a concealed speedbump on the property owned by 1815 E. Workman, LLC.

Tsai argued that he was entitled to summary judgment because he did not own the property where the incident occurred. However, he failed to present evidence regarding a lack of control over the property. The judge ruled that control of the property is a separate basis for liability than ownership or possession, and therefore, Tsai's motion for summary judgment was denied.

The judge also denied Tsai's request for sanctions. The case will proceed to trial, and the parties will need to prepare for a hearing on September 27, 2023.
