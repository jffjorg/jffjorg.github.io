The plaintiff alleges that she tripped over a concealed speedbump on property owned by the defendants and was injured. The defendant, John T. Tsai, moved for summary judgment, arguing that there are no triable issues of fact since he does not own the subject property.

The court also denied the defendant's request for sanctions.
