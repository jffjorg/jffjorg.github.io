And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by the defendant, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, to advance the hearing dates on three motions to compel supplemental responses from the plaintiff, Lewis Edward Thompson. The defendant has moved to advance the hearing dates because the parties have an October 3, 2023 mediation date, pending motions to compel set to be heard on March 11, 2024, and an injury of defense counsel which limits his ability to endure a full trial day. The court has reviewed the motions to compel and is amenable to hearing any opposition and reply orally at the hearing. The court is advancing the hearing on the motions to compel to October 13, 2023, and setting new deadlines for opposition and reply. The court has also vacated the hearings on the motions currently set for March 11, 2024, and September 28, 2023.
