And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by the defendant, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, to advance the hearing dates on three motions to compel supplemental responses from the plaintiff, Lewis Edward Thompson. The defendant has moved to advance the hearing dates because the parties have an October 3, 2023 mediation date, pending motions to compel set to be heard on March 11, 2024, and an injury of defense counsel which limits his ability to endure a full trial day. The court has reviewed the motions to compel and is amenable to hearing any opposition and reply orally at the hearing. The court is advancing the hearing on the motions to compel to October 13, 2023, and setting new deadlines for opposition and reply. The court has also vacated the hearings on the motions currently set for March 11, 2024, and September 28, 2023.

## English Summary  

This is the Judge's tentative ruling on a motion filed by the Defendant, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro), to advance the hearing dates for three motions to compel. These motions seek supplemental responses from Plaintiff, Lewis Edward Thompson, regarding document requests, interrogatories (form and special). 

Previously, the parties had stipulated to continue the trial date to April 2024, but the stipulation was rejected because the Court found insufficient cause.  Metro seeks to have the motions to compel heard before or shortly after a scheduled mediation in October.

The Judge is open to hearing the motions at the scheduled hearing on September 27th. However, if the parties agree, they can proceed with oral argument at that time. If not, the hearing is advanced to October 13th, 2023.  


The Judge emphasizes that all parties should make every effort to resolve the issues through meeting and conferring.
