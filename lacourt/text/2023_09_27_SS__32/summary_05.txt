And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion to compel production of documents from the plaintiff. The plaintiff failed to produce documents in response to the defendant's demands, despite serving verified responses on April 21, 2023. The court finds that the plaintiff did not act with substantial justification and therefore orders sanctions in the amount of $430 against the plaintiff and their counsel. The court orders the plaintiff to produce the responsive documents within 15 days and requires the plaintiff and their counsel to pay the sanctions to the defendant's counsel within 15 days.
