## English Summary

This tentative ruling summarizes a judge's consideration of a motion filed by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) to dismiss parts of a lawsuit filed by the parents of a deceased boy, Dutch Benjamin Abbott. 

The parents claim LADWP is liable for their son's death because he contracted a deadly amoebic infection after coming into contact with contaminated water at a man-made pond owned and operated by LADWP. 

The judge agrees with LADWP's argument that a specific legal protection (California Government Code section 855.4) shields LADWP from liability in this case. The judge explains that this protection applies to decisions regarding public health matters, and in this instance, LADWP's decisions regarding the water in the pond fall under this protection.

However, the judge acknowledges that the plaintiffs haven't clearly stated a specific mandatory duty LADWP allegedly violated. The judge grants LADWP's motion to dismiss the first two causes of action, but allows the plaintiffs to amend their complaint to potentially address this issue within 30 days.

English text:
The tentative ruling in the case 19STCV38052, scheduled for hearing on September 27, 2023 in Dept. 32, addresses the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings filed by the Defendant, City of Los Angeles, acting by and through the Department of Water and Power. The motion concerns the first and second causes of action in the complaint filed by the Plaintiffs, Jason Abbott and Roxanne Abbott, alleging statutory liability/dangerous condition on public property and statutory liability/breach of mandatory duties, respectively.

The standard for ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings is that under the state of the pleadings, together with matters that may be judicially noticed, it appears that a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The court has denied LADWP’s requests for judicial notice and granted Plaintiffs’ requests for judicial notice.

The court has determined that both causes of action are barred by California Government Code section 855.4, and therefore need not reach LADWP’s other arguments. The court has granted Plaintiffs leave to amend the complaint within 30 days, noting that it is not sufficient to merely allege a mandatory duty, but rather Plaintiffs must allege with particularity that the LADWP’s decision to act or not act in response to the public health issue was pursuant to a specific mandatory duty.
