And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the motion to compel arbitration filed by American Honda Motor Company, Inc. (Defendant). The motion is denied. The judge finds that the arbitration provision in the Retail Installment Sales Contract (RISC) is valid and enforceable, but the nonsignatory manufacturer cannot invoke the arbitration provision. The judge also finds that the claims brought by the plaintiffs do not arise out of the sales contract, but rather out of the manufacturer's warranty, and therefore the nonsignatory manufacturer cannot compel arbitration. The judge declines to reach the issue of arbitrability, which is the question of whether the dispute is suitable for resolution through arbitration.
