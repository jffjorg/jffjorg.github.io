  MOTION TO STRIKE
 
 



 


 
I.       INTRODUCTION
This case
arises out of an employment dispute between Plaintiff Jason Weeks (“Plaintiff”)
and Defendants Pure Imagination Holdings, LLC, Pure Imagination Studios Inc.,
Pure Imagination Labs, LLC, The Bridge XRC, LLC, and Joshua Wexler
(“Wexler”)(collectively “Defendants”). Plaintiff alleges he was hired by
Defendants in October 2020 as a Senior Developer. (See First Amended Complaint
(“FAC”), ¶ 18.) In September
2021, Plaintiff alleges Wexler and Andrew Tucker (“Mr. Tucker”) [not a party to
this litigation] “verbally and implied through their conduct, on behalf of
Defendants, agreed with Plaintiff on increased pay and a stake in PURE
HOLDINGS” “[i]n exchange for immediately assuming the role and responsibilities
of Vice President of Technology.” (See id. at ¶ 20.) Plaintiff further
alleges Defendants also agreed to reimburse Plaintiff for the approximately fifty
thousand dollars in work-related expenses Plaintiff incurred during his three-year
tenure. (See id. at ¶ 32.) Plaintiff alleges he quit his employment with
Defendants in June 2023 after “it became apparent that the Defendants did not
intend on honoring the agreement” [to increase Plaintiff’s pay and give
Plaintiff a stake in Pure Imagination Holdings, LLC]. (See id. at ¶ 29.)
On August 16,
2024, the Court overruled in part and sustained in part Defendants’ Demurrer
and granted Defendants’ Motion to Strike. 
On September
20, 2024, Plaintiff filed his FAC.
Defendants
now demurrer to Plaintiff’s first through fourth causes of action. Defendants
also seek to strike Plaintiff’s requested attorney’s fees in his sixth cause of
action and in his prayer for relief.

III.    LEGAL
STANDARD
A demurrer is a pleading used to test
the legal sufficiency of other pleadings. It raises issues of law, not
fact, regarding the form or content of the opposing party’s pleading
(complaint, answer or cross-complaint). (See Code Civ. Proc. §§
422.10, 589(a); see Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116
Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)[1] It
is not the function of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the
complaint; and for purposes of the ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in
the complaint are assumed to be true. (See Donabedian, 116 Cal.App.4th
at 994.) 
“We treat the demurrer as admitting all
material facts properly pleaded but not contentions, deductions or conclusions
of fact or law. We accept the factual allegations of the complaint as true and
also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.” (Mitchell v.
California Dept. of Pub. Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007, citation
omitted.) “[T]he facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true, however
improbable they may be. (Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co.
(1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604.) Allegations are to be liberally construed. (See
Code Civ. Proc. § 452.) A demurrer may be brought if insufficient facts are
stated to support the cause of action asserted. (See Code Civ. Proc. §
430.10(e).)  
“A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a
complaint as a matter of law.” (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010)
183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.) “[T]he court gives the complaint a reasonable
interpretation, and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded.” (Id.) In testing the sufficiency of the
complaint, the court must assume the truth of (1) the properly pleaded factual
allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably inferred from those expressly
pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (See Blank v. Kirwan (1985)
39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence
or other extrinsic matters. (See SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984)
153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) No other extrinsic evidence can be considered. (See
Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 881 [error for court
to consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting demurrer]; see also Afuso
v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862
[disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos.
(1988) 46 Cal.3d 287] [error to consider contents of release not part of court
record].) Accordingly, “[w]hether the plaintiff will be able to prove the
pleaded facts is irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer.” (Stevens v.
Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 605, 609-10.) 
A demurrer can only be sustained when
it disposes of an entire cause of action. (See Poizner v. Fremont
General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of Hawaiian
Gardens Redev. Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.) Leave to
amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. (See Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The
burden is on the complainant to show the Court a pleading can be amended
successfully. (Id.) However, “[i]f there is any reasonable possibility
that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to sustain a
demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245.)  
IV.     MEET AND CONFER
Before
filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party shall meet
and confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference with the party
who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of
determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a),
emphasis added.) A declaration must be filed with a demurrer regarding the
results of the meet and confer process. (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a)(3).)
         Defendants
filed a declaration attesting to the parties’ telephonic meet and confer efforts.
(See Declaration of Ronnie Arenas filed November 6, 2024, ¶ 3, Ex. 1.) The
Court finds the parties’ meet and confer efforts sufficient.  
V.      ANALYSIS  
A.           
Plaintiff Has Stated a Cause of Action for Breach
of Contract
 The essential elements of a contract
are: “(1) Parties capable of contracting; (2) Their consent; (3) A lawful
object; and (4) A sufficient cause or consideration.” (Code of Civ. Proc. §
1550.) “The standard elements of a claim for breach of contract are: ‘(1) the
contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3)
defendant’s breach, and (4) damage to plaintiff therefrom.’” (Wall Street
Network, Ltd. v. New York Times Co. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1171, 1178.) 
Defendants argue Plaintiff’s FAC now
contains facts wherein “Plaintiff admits that no agreement was in place, as
Defendants’ lawyers needed to provide a document in order for such an agreement
to be effective.” (Demurrer, pg. 12., citing FAC, ¶¶ 23, 24, 27, and 28.) “[T]he
Parties’ express reservation of critical terms for a future time, after lawyers
drafted essential documentation, demonstrates “there is no meeting of the minds
of the parties while they are merely negotiating as to the terms of the
agreement to be entered into.” (Demurrer, pp. 13-14, citation omitted.) 
Plaintiff did not oppose. 
The Court is again unpersuaded by
Defendants’ argument. The additional facts in Plaintiff’s FAC are not a
departure from the allegations in his Complaint. In his Complaint, Plaintiff
alleged “[w]henever Plaintiff asked JOSHUA and Andrew Tucker for his pay
increase and documentation of Plaintiff’s stake in PURE HOLDINGS, Plaintiff
would be assured that the documentation was in progress.” (Complaint, ¶ 22.) In
Plaintiff’s FAC, Plaintiff merely reiterates Defendants’ assurances that the
agreement was in place but not memorialized in writing. (See FAC, ¶¶ 24
(“…JOSHUA again assured Plaintiff that the documentation of Plaintiff’s stake in
PURE HOLDINGS was still being worked on…”); 25 (“…Andrew explained to Plaintiff
that Plaintiff’s stake in PURE HOLDINGS would derive from a 20% stake that
JOSHUA and Andrew owned and were giving up in PURE HOLDINGS to share with
Plaintiff.”); 27 (“…Plaintiff was assured on several different occasions…that
Plaintiff was a stakeholder in PURE HOLDINGS and that the documentation was
being worked on by the lawyers.”); and 28 (“The most recent occasion that
Plaintiff was assured that Plaintiff was a stakeholder in PURE HOLDINGS was in
the early summer or late spring of 2023…”).)
Plaintiff has not, contrary to
Defendants’ argument, “admit[ed] that no agreement was in place, as Defendants’
lawyers needed to provide a document in order for such an agreement to be
effective.” The Court’s ruling on Defendants’ previous Demurrer still stands. Plaintiff
has pled sufficient facts to support the elements of a claim for breach of
contract. 
Accordingly, the Court OVERRULES Defendants’ Demurrer as to
Plaintiff’s first cause of action for breach of contract. 
B.           
Plaintiff Has Stated Causes of Action for
Actionable Deceit (Code Civ. Proc. § 1709), Fraud in Contract Formation (Code
Civ. Proc. § 1572), and Intentional Misrepresentation (Code Civ. Proc. § 1710)
“The
elements of fraud, which give rise to the tort action for deceit, are (1) a
misrepresentation, (2) with knowledge of its falsity, (3) with the intent to
induce another's reliance on the misrepresentation, (4) justifiable reliance,
and (5) resulting damage.” (Conroy v. Regents of Univ. of Cal. (2009) 45
Cal.4th 1244, 1255.) 
“[F]raud
must be specifically pleaded. This means: (1) general pleading of the legal
conclusion of fraud is insufficient; and (2) every element of the cause of
action for fraud must be alleged in full, factually and specifically, and the
policy of liberal construction of pleading will not usually be invoked to
sustain a pleading that is defective in any material respect.” (Wilhelm v.
Pray, Price, Williams & Russell (1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 1324, 1331.) In
addition, a cause of action of fraud against a corporation requires a plaintiff
to allege the names of persons who made the allegedly fraudulent
representations, their authority to speak, to whom they spoke, what they said
or wrote, and when. (See Tarmann v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.
(1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153, 157-58.)
Nonperformance
alone does not prove a defendant’s intent not to perform. (See Tenzer v.
Superscope, Inc. (1985) 39 Cal.3d 18, 31 (“[I]f plaintiff adduces no
further evidence of fraudulent intent than proof of nonperformance of an oral
promise, he will never reach a jury.”).) However, a plaintiff can infer
fraudulent intent from circumstantial evidence, such as “as defendant's
insolvency, his hasty repudiation of the promise, his failure even to attempt
performance, or his continued assurances after it was clear he would not
perform.” (Tenzer, 39 Cal.3d at 30.)
Defendants
argue Plaintiff’s fraud causes of action fail because they have not been
alleged with the requisite specificity. (See Demurrer, pg. 15.)
Specifically, Defendants argue Plaintiff failed to allege a specific
misrepresentation, failed to allege Defendants’ knowledge or intent not to
perform, failed to allege justifiable reliance, and failed to allege more than
speculative damages. (See Demurrer, pp. 15-19.) 
The
Court finds Plaintiff has sufficiently plead his causes of action based on
Defendants’ alleged fraud. Plaintiff’s FAC specifically pleads Defendants’
misrepresentations by adding multiple dates, names, and other details about
those misrepresentations, identifies Defendants’ repeated assurances without
further action (from which fraudulent intent can be inferred), Plaintiff’s
justifiable reliance on Defendants’ repeated representations, and damages
($50,000.00 in expenses, stock, and a pay raise). Taken together, these
allegations are sufficient to support Plaintiff’s causes of action for fraud.      
Accordingly, the Court OVERRULES Defendants’ Demurrer as to Plaintiff’s
second, third, and fourth causes of action for actionable deceit, fraud in contract
formation, and intentional misrepresentation. 
VI.        
MOTION TO STRIKE
The court may, upon a motion, or at any time in
its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false,
or improper matter inserted in any pleading. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 436(a).)
The court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in
conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.
(See id. at § 436(b).) The grounds for a motion to strike are that the pleading
has irrelevant, false or improper matter, or has not been drawn or filed in
conformity with laws. (See id. at § 436.) The grounds for moving to strike must
appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice. (See id. at §
437.)
Defendants move to strike Plaintiff’s prayer for
relief “[f]or an award of reasonable attorney’s fees pursuant to California
Labor Code § 218.5” and Plaintiff’s requested attorney’s fees, also based on
Labor Code § 218.5, contained in his sixth cause of action. (See Demurrer,
pg. 20.)
Plaintiff did not
oppose. 
First, Defendants’
Motion is procedurally deficient. A motion to strike must be filed separately
and “must quote in full the portions sought to be stricken except where the
motion is to strike an entire paragraph, cause of action, count, or defense.
Specifications in a notice must be numbered consecutively.” (Rules of Court,
rule 3.1322(a).) Defendants placed their Motion at the end of their Demurrer
and did not properly set forth the portions of Plaintiff’s FAC that they wish
to be stricken.
The Court will
nonetheless rule on Defendants’ Motion in the interest of judicial efficiency. “A party
is entitled to an award of¿attorney¿fees¿if there
is a specific authorization therefor by statute or private agreement.” (Beverly Hills Properties v.
Marcolino (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d Supp. 7, 10.) Plaintiff’s request for
attorney fees is based on Labor Code § 218.5. Labor Code § 218.5 allows reasonable
attorney’s fees and costs “[i]n any action brought for the nonpayment of wages,
fringe benefits, or health and welfare or pension fund contributions.” (Lab.
Code § 218.5.) This action isn’t a wage and hour lawsuit nor has Plaintiff asserted
any violations of the Labor Code. Thus, Plaintiff cannot recover attorney’s
fees via Labor Code § 218.5. 
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS WITH LEAVE TO
AMEND Defendants’ Motion to Strike as to Plaintiff’s
prayer for relief for attorney’s fees and Plaintiff’s requested attorney’s fees
contained in his sixth cause of action.

VII.    
CONCLUSION
         
Based on the foregoing analysis, the Court OVERRULES Defendants’ Demurrer.
The Court also GRANTS WITH LEAVE TO AMEND
Defendants’ Motion to Strike as to Plaintiff’s
prayer for relief for attorney’s fees and Plaintiff’s requested attorney’s fees
contained in his sixth cause of action.
If Plaintiff wishes to file a second amended
complaint that addresses his request for attorney’s fees, which is the only
subject for which he has leave to amend, he shall do so on or before February 7,
2025. 
         IT
IS SO ORDERED.
DATED:     January 21, 2025
