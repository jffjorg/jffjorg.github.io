  Case Number:  20STCV09612    Hearing Date:   January 16, 2024    Dept:  74 Glenn Feldman
v. Fraser Ross, et al.
 
Plaintiff’s
Glenn Feldman’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production
of Documents (Set Two) from Defendant KitRoss Apparel Los Angeles, LLC
 
The court considered the moving papers and reply. The
court will exercise its discretion and consider the untimely opposition.
BACKGROUND
            This action arises from
a contractual dispute.
            On March 9, 2020,
Plaintiff Glenn Feldman (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against Defendant Kitross
Apparel Los Angeles, LLC (Defendant) and others. In the complaint, Plaintiff
alleged the following causes of action: intentional misrepresentation, negligent
misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of implied covenant of good
faith and fair dealing, constructive trust, accounting, and fraudulent
conversion.
            On August 16, 2023,
Plaintiff propounded requests for production (set two) (RFPs) on Defendant.
            On September 19, 2023,
Defendant served responses to the RFPs at issue. Plaintiff was dissatisfied.
            The parties met and
conferred to no avail.
            On December 5, 2023,
Plaintiff filed this motion to compel further responses to RFP Nos. 78-112,
115-198, and 200-210.
            On January 4, 2024,
Defendant served Plaintiff with further responses and produced responsive
documents.
LEGAL STANDARD
            A propounding party may move for an
order compelling a further response to a demand for inspection if the
propounding party deems that an answer or statement of compliance is evasive or
incomplete, or that an objection is “without merit or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a).) Such a
motion must set forth specific facts showing good cause for the discovery
sought and be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2031.310, subd. (b), 2031.210, subd. (b).) ¿  
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff seeks further responses to
RFP Nos. 78-112, 115-198, and 200-210. As a preliminary matter, the court finds Plaintiff has
demonstrated good cause for this motion and the parties have sufficiently met
and conferred. Given Defendant’s supplemental responses and document production
on January 4, the court finds this motion moot. However, sanctions
are warranted under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310, subdivision (h).
In its untimely opposition, Defendant has not persuaded the court that substantial
justification existed for the delayed responses and production. Moreover,
Plaintiff’s counsels’ hourly rates are reasonable and they have substantiated
their request for attorney fees. (Kay Decl., ¶ 8.) 
CONCLUSION
              Based on the foregoing, the court finds
Plaintiff’s motion to compel further discovery responses moot. The court grants
Plaintiff’s counsel’s request for sanctions. Defendant shall pay Plaintiff’s
counsel $2,925 ($1,575 + $1,350) by February 16, 2024.
            Plaintiff shall give notice.
