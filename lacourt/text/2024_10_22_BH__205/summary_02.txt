**Significant Statements**

* "It is baffling to this Court that the parties cannot agree on deposition scheduling on depositions noticed more than nine months ago, in January 2024."
* "Focus cannot 'game' the system by serving deposition notices with dates earlier than it offered to KSFB when KSFB noticed the depositions of Focus' witnesses months earlier."
* "In the interest of moving this case along and to avoid further gamesmanship, the Court will order that Focus make Mr. Chang available on the dates it previously provided to Plaintiff (November 21 or 22)."
* "The Court admonishes the parties to cooperate in discovery, as there have been far too many discovery motions in this case."
