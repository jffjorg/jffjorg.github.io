And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to vacate the trial date and to file a cross-complaint. The court finds that the defendant has been aware of the case and the pending trial date for over a year but has taken no steps to seek leave to file a cross-complaint. Instead, the defendant has taken meritless actions to try to delay the trial, including filing an untimely challenge to the court and pursuing a baseless appeal. The court finds that the defendant's request is made in bad faith, to prejudice the plaintiff and cause further expense and delay in resolving the matter.
