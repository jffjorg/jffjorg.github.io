And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike brought by the defendant, AvantGarde Senior Living, against the second amended complaint filed by plaintiff, Wesley Su. The court has found that the defendant's demurrer is OVERRULED, meaning that the plaintiff's allegations in the second amended complaint are sufficient to state a cause of action for elder abuse.

The court has also granted the defendant's motion to strike, in part, striking the request for treble damages under Civil Code section 3345. However, the court has denied the motion to strike the request for attorney's fees and punitive damages.

The court's ruling is based on the allegations in the second amended complaint, which include claims that the defendant recklessly neglected the care and treatment of the plaintiff's decedent, resulting in injuries and death. The court has found that these allegations are sufficient to plead a claim for elder abuse and that the defendant's conduct was reckless and arose to the level of recklessness.

The court's ruling is tentative, meaning that it is subject to change after further briefing and argument by the parties.
