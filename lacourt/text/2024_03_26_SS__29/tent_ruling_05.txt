 Case Number:  21STCV44157    Hearing Date:   March 26, 2024    Dept:  29 Defendant’s Motion to Compel the Deposition of Plaintiff
 
Tentative
The motion is granted.
Background
On
December 2, 2021, Plaintiff Michelle Clyoine Sampson (“Plaintiff”) filed her
complaint against Ereka Mamasig (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 60, asserting
causes of action for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence arising out
an accident occurring on March 17, 2020, in Long Beach.  Defendant filed an answer on October 11,
2022.
On May
10, 2023, Plaintiff appeared for her deposition.  The deposition was suspended after approximately
40 minutes as Plaintiff stated that she was in severe pain and could not continue
to testify.  (Mosier Decl., ¶ 5 &
Exh. C.)  Attempts to reschedule the
remainder of the deposition were not successful.  (Id., ¶¶ 6-7.)
On
November 3, 2023, the Court granted the motion of Plaintiff’s counsel to be
relieved.  Plaintiff is now representing
herself.
On November
21, 2023, Defendant noticed Plaintiff’s continued deposition for January 8,
2024.  (Id., ¶ 9 & Exh. G.)  The notice, however, was electronically
served on Plaintiff’s former counsel.  (Id.,
Exh. G.)
On December
22, 2023, Defendant noticed Plaintiff’s continued deposition for January 31,
2024.  (Id., ¶ 11 & Exh. H.)  The notice was mailed to Plaintiff’s address
on January 2 and also personally served on Plaintiff on January 9.  (Id., Exh. H.)
Plaintiff
did not appear for her deposition on January 31.  (Id., ¶ 12 & Exh. I.)
On February 16, 2024, Defendant filed this
motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff. Defendant served Plaintiff by
mail.
No opposition has been filed.
Legal Standard
“Any party may obtain discovery … by taking in California the oral
deposition of any person, including any party to the action.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.)  Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.210
through 2025.280 provide the requirements for (among other things) what must be
included in a deposition notice, when and where depositions may be taken, and
how and when the notice must be served.  
“The service of a deposition notice … is effective to require any
deponent who is a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent,
or employee of a party to attend and to testify, as well as to produce any
document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing for inspection
and copying.”  (Id., § 2025.280,
subd. (a).)
Section 2025.410, subdivision (a), requires any party to serve a
written objection at least three days before the deposition if the party
contends that a deposition notice does not comply with the provisions of
sections 2025.210 through 2025.280.
Section 2025.450 provides: “If, after service of a deposition
notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or
employee of a party, or
a person designated by an organization that is a party under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid
objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to
proceed with it, or to produce for¿inspection any document, electronically
stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the
party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance
and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice.”  (Id.,  §
2025.450, subd. (a).)  Any such motion to compel must show good
cause for the production of documents and, when a deponent has failed to
appear, the motion must be accompanied “by a declaration stating that the
petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.”  (Id., § 2025.450, subd. (b).)  
Generally, a party may be deposed only
once.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.610,
subd. (a).)  “[F]or good cause shown, the
court may grant leave to take a subsequent deposition, and the parties, with
the consent of any deponent who is not a party, may stipulate that a subsequent
deposition be taken.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.610, subd. (b).)
Discussion
Plaintiff
previously appeared for her deposition, but the deposition was suspended after approximately
only forty minutes due to a medical condition of Plaintiff.  (Mosier Decl., ¶ 5 & Exh. C.)  Defendant now noticed an additional session
of Plaintiff’s deposition, but Plaintiff did not appear.  (Id., ¶¶ 6-7 11-12 & Exhs. H, I.)
 
Defendant
has shown good cause for the order requested, regardless of whether Defendant’s
request is viewed as seeking an order to complete Plaintiff’s first deposition
or an order for leave to take a second deposition.
The only
concern that the Court has is with the April 4 proposed date for deposition.  That is only nine days from the hearing date,
and Defendant will need to give notice of this ruling to Plaintiff through mail
service.  The Court will order Plaintiff
to appear for her deposition on or after April 15, 2024.
Accordingly,
Defendant’s motion is granted, subject to a minor modification of the date for
the deposition.
Conclusion
 
The Court
GRANTS Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff to appear for and testify at
deposition.
 
The
Court ORDERS Plaintiff to appear for and testify at deposition on April __,
2024, at 10 am at Lexitas/AdvancedOne, 17752 Sky Park Circle, Suite 100,
Irvine, California 92614.
 
Moving party is ORDERED to give notice.
