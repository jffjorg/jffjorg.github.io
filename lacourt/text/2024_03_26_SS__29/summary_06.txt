And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the petition to approve a minor's compromise for Matteo Devita, a 13-year-old. The judge excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and the guardian ad litem, and allows counsel to appear by telephone or video conference. The judge has reviewed the petition and identified several deficiencies that must be addressed before it can be approved. These deficiencies include errors in the petition and proposed order, a lack of supporting documentation, and failure to comply with California rules of court. As a result, the judge is denying the petition without prejudice, allowing the petitioner to submit a new petition that addresses these deficiencies.
