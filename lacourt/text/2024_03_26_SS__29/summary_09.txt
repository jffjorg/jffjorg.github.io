And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Numark's motion to compel the deposition of Jennie Levin without prejudice, citing procedural grounds. Numark failed to serve Jennie Levin with a deposition subpoena and also failed to personally serve her with the motion papers. The judge has also denied both parties' requests for sanctions. The judge orders Numark to give notice of the denial.
