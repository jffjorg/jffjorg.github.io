And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court granted the plaintiff's motion to continue trial. The plaintiff, Robert Bishop, III, is scheduled to undergo neck fusion surgery on April 3, 2024, and has a high risk of paralysis if he does not have the surgery immediately. The recovery time is expected to be 6-12 months. The court found that the plaintiff has established good cause for the requested continuance based on his medical condition. The defendants, Salvador Penatovar and KS Trans Service, opposed the motion but did not present any evidence that the requested continuance would cause them to suffer any unfair or undue prejudice. The trial date is continued to early October 2024.
