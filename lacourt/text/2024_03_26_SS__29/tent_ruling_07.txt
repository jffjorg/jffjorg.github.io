 Case Number:  22STCV16157    Hearing Date:   March 26, 2024    Dept:  29 Defendant’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special
Interrogatories (Set Two)
Defendant’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production (Set
Two)
 
Tentative
The Court will hear from counsel.
In addition to other issues that counsel may wish to address,
the Court would like to hear from counsel on the following issue: were Plaintiff’s
further responses to the discovery (served on or about February 23, 2024)
signed by counsel and verified by Plaintiff?
The Court’s tentative ruling is that the motions are granted
in part and denied in part.
Background
This
matter arises from an alleged slip and fall on May 18, 2020, at an Albertson’s
store on Crenshaw Boulevard in Los Angeles.  On May 16, 2022,
Plaintiff Anthony Renee Beamon (“Plaintiff”) filed the Complaint in this action
against Defendants Albertsons Safeway, LLC, Albertson’s LLC, Manager Precious,
and Does 1 through 50, asserting causes of action for general negligence and
premises liability. 
On
August 10, 2022, Defendant Albertsons LLC (erroneously sued as Albertsons
Safeway, LLC and as Albertson’s LLC) (“Defendant”) filed its Answer to the
Complaint.
On
February 20, 2024, Defendant filed a cross-complaint for indemnity against
Source Refrigeration and HVAC, Inc., Coolsys, Inc., and Roes 1 through 10.
As it
relates to the matters set for hearing on March 26, 2024, Defendant served Plaintiff
with discovery on September 12, 2023, including Special Interrogatories (Set Two)
and Requests for Production (Set Two). 
(Johnson Decls., ¶ 3 & Exhs. 1.) 
Plaintiff requested, and Defendant granted, a series of extensions of
time to respond to the discovery, up to November 14, 2023.  (Id., ¶¶ 4-6 & Exhs. 2-4.)  Plaintiff still failed to serve timely
responses to the discovery requests.  (Id.,
¶ 7.)
On November
28, 2023, Plaintiff served responses.  (Id.,
¶ 7 & Exhs. 5.)  Defendant contends
that these responses are not code compliant. 
Following additional correspondence, the dispute was not resolved.  
On January
30, 2024, Defendant filed these two motions: a motion to compel further
responses to Special Interrogatories (Set Two) and a motion to compel further responses
to Requests for Production (Set Two).  Defendant
also requests sanctions in both motions. 
Plaintiff filed oppositions on March 13, and Defendant filed replies on March
19.
While
the motion was pending, Plaintiff served supplemental responses to the discovery
requests.
Legal Standard
“On receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding
party may move for an order compelling a further response if the propounding
party deems that any of the following apply: (1) An answer to a particular
interrogatory is evasive or incomplete. (2) An exercise of the option to
produce documents under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required
specification of those documents is inadequate. (3) An objection to an
interrogatory is without merit or too general.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a).)
Notice of a motion to compel further responses must be given
“within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental
verified response, or on or before any specific later date to which the
propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing.” (Id.,
subd. (c).)
A motion to compel further responses must be accompanied by a meet-and-confer
declaration and a separate statement or, in the discretion of the Court, a
“concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute.” (Id.,
subd. (b)(1) & (b)(2); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345.)
“The court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel a further response to interrogatories, unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (d).)
“On receipt of a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, the demanding party may move for an order compelling
further response to the demand if the demanding party deems that any of the
following apply: (1) A statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete.  (2) A representation of
inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.  (3) An objection in the response is without
merit or too general.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.310, subd. (a).)
Notice of a motion to compel further responses must be given
“within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental
verified response, or on or before any specific later date to which the
propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing.” (Id.,
subd. (c).)
A motion to compel further responses must set forth specific
facts showing good cause for the discovery and must be accompanied by a meet-and-confer
declaration and a separate statement or, in the discretion of the Court, a
“concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute.” (Id.,
subd. (b)(1)-(3); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345.)
“[T]he court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel further response to a demand, unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (h).)
In Chapter 7 of the
Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision (a)
provides, in pertinent part, that the court may impose a monetary sanction ordering
that any person “engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any
attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” A “misuse of
the discovery process” includes (among other things) failing to respond or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery; making, without substantial
justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an evasive
response to a discovery request; disobeying a court order to provide discovery;
and making or opposing, unsuccessfully, a motion to compel without substantial
justification. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d)-(h).)
Discussion
In its motions, Defendant moves to compel further responses to
Special Interrogatories Nos. 13-24, 27-28, 30, 32, 34-37, 40-51, 58-62, 65, 67,
73-79, 85-90, 98-99, 115, and 116 and to Requests for Production Nos. 26-29,
36-44, 46, 48-53, 58, 60, 61, 67, and 68.
While these motions were pending, Plaintiff served
supplemental responses to the discovery requests.
In its reply papers, Defendant contends that even as
supplemented, the following discovery responses are not code compliant: Special
Interrogatories Nos. 13, 22, 36, 40, 46, 49-51, 58-62, 74, and 115, and
Requests for Production Nos. 29, 37-40, 41, 44, 49, and 61.  The Court proceeds based on the assumption
that it is only as to these discovery requests for which a ruling is sought.
Special Interrogatory Nos. 13, 22, 40, 46
These responses are factual and code compliant.  The motion to compel is denied.
Special Interrogatory Nos. 36, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62,
74, 115.
These responses are not complete, straightforward, sufficient,
or code compliant.  The motion to compel
is granted.
Special Interrogatory Nos. 49-51
These responses, in which Plaintiff states that he does not
have knowledge sufficient to respond, are code compliant.  The motion to compel is denied.
Request for Production Nos. 29, 40, 41, 44, 49, 61
These responses are complete and code compliant: Plaintiff
states that he has produced all responsive documents.  The motion to compel is denied.
Request for Production Nos. 37, 38, 39
These responses, in which Plaintiff states that he is unable
to comply, are not code compliant.  (See
Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.320).  The motion
to compel is granted.
Sanctions
Defendant’s requests for sanctions are granted in part.  Taking into consideration all of the relevant
fact and circumstances, including that the motions to compel are granted in
part and denied in part, and the economies of scale associated with preparing
parallel motions, the Court sets sanctions on the motion to compel further
responses to special interrogatories in the amount of $810, calculated based on
three hours of attorney time, multiplied by counsel’s reasonable billing rate
of $250 per hour, plus the $60 filing fee, and sets sanctions on the motion to
compel further responses to special interrogatories in the amount of $560,
calculated based on two hours of attorney time, multiplied by counsel’s reasonable
billing rate of $250 per hour, plus the $60 filing fee,.
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Defendant’s
motions to compel.
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff to provide verified, written, code
compliant responses, without objection to Special Interrogatories Nos. 36, 58,
59, 60, 61, 62, 74, and 115 within 21 days of notice of the ruling.
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff to provide verified, written, code
compliant responses, without objection to Requests for Production Nos. 37, 38, and
39 within 21 days of notice of the ruling.
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff and counsel of record the Law
Offices of Jacob Emrani, jointly and severally, to pay monetary sanctions to
Defendant under the Civil Discovery Act in the total amount of $1,370 within 30
days of notice of the ruling.
The Court DENIES the motions in all other respects.
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
