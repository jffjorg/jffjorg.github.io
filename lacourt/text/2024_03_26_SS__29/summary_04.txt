Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion of Defendant Susan Reichert for a determination that her settlement with Plaintiff Anne-Marie Kent is a good faith settlement under California Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6. The settlement amount is $50,000, which is within the policy limits of Defendant Reichert. The judge has considered the Tech-Bilt factors and finds that the settlement agreement is reasonable in light of the settling party's proportionate liability. The Kelterborns, the other defendants, have opposed the motion, but the judge has concluded that they have not met their ultimate burden of persuasion.
