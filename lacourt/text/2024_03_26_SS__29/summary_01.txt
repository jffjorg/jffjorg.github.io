And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to substitute Brenda Wells as the plaintiff in place of her deceased husband, Richard Wells. Richard Wells died on August 13, 2023, and his widow, Brenda Wells, seeks to substitute as the plaintiff in this slip and fall case. The Court has determined that Brenda Wells' declaration does not meet all the mandatory requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure section 377.32, so the motion is denied without prejudice on procedural grounds. The Court notes that judgment was entered after Richard Wells' death, and Brenda Wells may have grounds to set aside the judgment if she is properly substituted into the case.
