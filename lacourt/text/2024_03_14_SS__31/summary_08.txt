And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel further responses from the defendant. The plaintiffs, Darel Kimhi and Chana Avtzon, have filed a motion to compel the defendant, Nicholas Sterner, to provide further responses to their special interrogatories. However, the judge has determined that the motion is premature because the parties have not participated in an informal discovery conference (IDC) prior to the hearing. The IDC is currently scheduled for March 27, 2024. The judge orders the parties to participate in the IDC as required by the court's standing order. The moving party is also ordered to continue the hearing on motions to compel further discovery responses three weeks after the IDC. If the parties are unable to resolve all outstanding issues at the IDC, they must submit a joint statement of items in dispute at least two weeks prior to the continued hearing date. The judge encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement and warns that if all parties do not submit or appear at the hearing, the court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the court.
