The Judge, Hon. Michelle C. Kim, has issued a Tentative Ruling in the case of Marina Ruiz and Jazmin Guzman vs. Fernando Cazares, et al. The case involves a motion to compel plaintiff Marina Ruiz to respond to discovery requests propounded by defendant Fernando Cazares.

The defendant seeks an order compelling the plaintiff to respond and also seeks sanctions.

The Judge has also awarded sanctions to the defendant in the amount of $225, which includes attorney's fees and costs.

The Judge notes that the defendant is the only party that propounded the discovery at issue, and therefore limits the order to the evidence provided. The Judge also awards sanctions against the plaintiff and her counsel in the amount of $620, which includes attorney's fees and costs.
