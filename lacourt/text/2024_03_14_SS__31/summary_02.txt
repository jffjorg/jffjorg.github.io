```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendants' unopposed motion for terminating sanctions against the plaintiff, Patricio Harris and Cheuk Ying Lam. The plaintiff failed to serve verified discovery responses in compliance with the court's November 2023 order, despite being in pro per and aware of the discovery obligations. The court finds that the plaintiff's failure was willful and that lesser sanctions would not curb the abuse. As a result, the court has dismissed the plaintiff's action against the defendant, Uber Technologies.
