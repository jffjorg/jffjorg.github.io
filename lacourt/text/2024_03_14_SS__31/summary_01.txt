And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of granting a default judgment against Mozafar Babaie in the amount of $250. The plaintiff, Augustin Ramos, filed a request for default judgment after being injured during a haircut at Great Cuts Beauty Salon, where Babaie allegedly cut off a portion of Ramos's upper right ear. The plaintiff initially sought $45,000 in general damages for pain and suffering, but failed to provide evidence to support this claim. On the second request, the plaintiff submitted three photographs of his ear, which show a superficial and barely visible injury. Despite this, the judge reduced the amount sought from $45,000 to $250 due to the lack of support. The judge conditionally granted the default judgment, requiring the plaintiff to file a proper proposed order using JUD-100 within 10 days.
