And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA), filed a motion to strike the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint (FAC) on February 2, 2024, arguing that the plaintiff did not have leave to file the amended complaint. However, the judge notes that the plaintiff filed the FAC on January 4, 2024, without seeking leave, and that the FAC was subsequently stricken on January 8, 2024. As the FAC was stricken, LACMTA's motion is now moot and taken off-calendar. The judge orders that the moving party give notice of this ruling. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if a party intends to submit to the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the case number and other required information.
