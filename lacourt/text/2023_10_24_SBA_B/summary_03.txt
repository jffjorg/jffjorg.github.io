And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Gary Y. Tanaka, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Rancho Palos Verdes Estates LLC v. Robert R. Maxwell, et al. The case involves a dispute over adjacent real property in Rancho Palos Verdes Estates, where Defendants' property is encroaching into the property line of Plaintiff's property.

The judge has sustained without leave to amend the demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint, which means that the Complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. Specifically, the judge has found that the Complaint fails to allege any facts to meet the element of "defendant's intentional, reckless, or negligent entry onto the property" in the first cause of action for trespass. The judge has also found that the Complaint fails to state facts sufficient to meet the elements of a nuisance and negligence cause of action.

The judge has also granted the motion to strike certain irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in the pleading, but this is moot since the demurrer has been sustained.

The judge has ordered that the ruling be given notice to the parties.
