Significant Statements:
  - "Doomsday" sanctions are reserved for parties who commit willful, repeated, violations of court orders.
  - "Generally, [a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction."

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Gary Y. Tanaka, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Eunmin Kim v. Andrew Lwin, et al. The case involves a dispute over allegations of sexual harassment, eviction, and other conduct by the Defendant against the Plaintiff, who was a tenant. The Defendant has moved for terminating sanctions and monetary sanctions against the Plaintiff, alleging that the Plaintiff and Plaintiff's counsel disobeyed a court order. However, the Judge has denied the motion, finding that the Plaintiff did not willfully disobey the court order and that the motion was not timely filed. The Judge also notes that the Defendant failed to provide notice of a previous court order, which makes it difficult to determine whether the Plaintiff complied with the order. Overall, the Judge finds that it is not appropriate to impose terminating sanctions against the Plaintiff and denies the motion.
