And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to continue the trial date of November 14, 2023. The defendant argued that they needed more time to prepare for trial because their previous attorney became ill and a new attorney has not had time to review the case. The judge found that the defendant had not shown good cause for the continuance and that the motion was essentially a request for reconsideration of the judge's previous ruling. The judge also noted that the defendant's argument that the continuance would help the plaintiff complete their discovery was not persuasive. Finally, the judge denied the motion without prejudice, allowing the defendant to re-file the motion if circumstances change. The judge also ordered that the final status conference and motion to bifurcate, previously set for November 7 and 8, 2023, be continued to November 13, 2023.
