And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted Defendant's motion to stay proceedings pending appeal. The Defendant argues that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) preempts Code Civ. Proc., section 1294(a), which provides that an order dismissing or denying a petition to compel arbitration is not automatically stayed during the pendency of an appeal. The Judge finds that the FAA does not conflict with section 1294(a) and that the section is not preempted. The Judge also finds that the Court has the discretion to stay proceedings in the interests of justice and to promote judicial efficiency, and that a stay would conserve judicial resources if the Defendant prevails on appeal. Therefore, the Court will stay the matter pending the outcome of the appeal.
