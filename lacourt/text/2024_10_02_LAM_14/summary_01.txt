Summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment or adjudication due to the excessive length and unusability of the separate statements submitted by both parties. The defendants' 401-page separate statement does not comply with California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1350, which requires that a separate statement only include material facts related to the motion. The judge finds that the separate statements are unusable due to their length, and that the parties have failed to provide the court with a usable separate statement. The judge will not go searching through the voluminous record to reach a ruling.
