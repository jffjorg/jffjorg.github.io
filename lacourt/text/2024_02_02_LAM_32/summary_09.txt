And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by the defendant, Stillwater Insurance Company, to file a cross-complaint to adjudicate its liability for indemnification. The plaintiff, Poonam Dua, opposes the motion, arguing that the defendant failed to assert the claim at the time of its answer and that the statute only allows for the amendment of an existing cross-complaint, not the belated filing of a new one.

The judge concludes that the statute explicitly permits the late filing of a cross-complaint and that the defendant has not established sufficient bad faith to justify denial of the motion. The judge finds that the defendant's failure to assert the claim earlier was due to the fact that it did not need to, as the issue of liability could have been resolved in the plaintiff's claims. The judge grants the defendant's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint, allowing the defendant to assert its claim to recover the amount it paid to the plaintiff.
