And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendants' motion to compel arbitration in the case of The Crème Shop Inc. v. Russ August & Kabat et al. The case involves a dispute over the validity of an arbitration agreement between the parties. The defendants argue that the agreement is valid and should be enforced, while the plaintiff argues that the entire engagement agreement is void due to violation of Rules of Professional Conduct.

The Judge finds that the defendants have provided sufficient proof of an arbitration agreement, and that the agreement is not invalid due to a violation of public policy. The Judge also finds that the claims asserted in the complaint are arbitrable, and that the delegation clause in the agreement should be enforced.

As a result, the Judge grants the defendants' motion to compel arbitration, and stays the case in its entirety pending the outcome of the arbitration.
