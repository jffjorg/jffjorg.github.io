     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion for assignment of
  payment rights 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On July 29, 2022, Plaintiff Linkage
Financial Group, Inc. filed this action against Defendants Double Hi Express
Tours, Inc. (Double Hi) and Hai Jie Wong (Wong), asserting causes of action for
(1) breach of contract, (2) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and
fair dealing, and (3) money lent. 
            On November 2, 2022, the Court
granted default judgment for Plaintiff against both Defendants in the total
amount of $614,423.47. 
            On December 22, 2023, Plaintiff
filed the instant motion for assignment of payment rights. Defendants have not
filed an opposition. 
LEGAL STANDARD
“[U]pon application of the judgment
creditor on noticed motion, the court may order the judgment debtor to assign
to the judgment creditor . . . all or part of a right to payment due or to
become due . . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 708.510(a).) “A right to payment may be
assigned pursuant to this article only to the extent necessary to satisfy the
money judgment.” (Id., subd. (d).) “When an application is made pursuant
to Section 708.510 or thereafter, the judgment creditor may apply to the court
for an order restraining the judgment debtor from assigning or otherwise
disposing of the right to payment that is sought to be assigned.” (Id.,
§ 708.520(a).)
DISCUSSION
            On March 23, 2023, the parties
entered into a settlement and forbearance agreement to settle the judgment and
other outstanding loans. (Chen Decl. ¶ 9.) Defendants made two installment
payments under the agreement but have not made any payments since. (Id.,
¶ 12.) Defendants have expressed that they are unable to make any further payments.
(Id., ¶ 13.) Crediting the two installment payments and accounting for
interest, the balance owed as of November 14, 2023 is $627,431.43. (Lin Decl. ¶
6.) 
Plaintiff’s investigation revealed that
Defendant Wong controls the companies M Coach USA, Inc. and M Coach, Inc. (Chen
Decl. ¶ 15, Ex. 4.) Plaintiff’s investigation further revealed that Defendant
Double Hi lends its primary assets, tour buses, to M Coach USA for minimal consideration
and that M Coach USA retains the vast majority of profits earned. (Id.,
¶¶ 16-17.) This suggests to Plaintiff that Defendants are intentionally diverting
assets to prevent them from being used to satisfy the judgment. (Id., ¶ 21.)
Defendant Wong appeared at a debtor examination on December 12, 2023, admitting
that M Coach USA’s finances are commingled with that of Defendant Double Hi and
that revenue is generated through M Coach USA using assets of Double Hi. (Id.,
¶ 22.) Wong promised to provide a workable solution by December 19, 2023, but
the parties have not agreed on one. (Id., ¶ 23.)    
            Based on the above facts, Plaintiff
is entitled to an assignment of all payments from M Coach USA to Defendants. Defendants
do not oppose the motion and therefore concede that an assignment is warranted.

 
 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion for assignment of
payment rights is GRANTED as to payments by M Coach USA, Inc. to Double Hi
Express Tours, Inc. or Hai Jie Wong.
