And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion by plaintiff Robert Howard to file a second amended complaint. The motion is in response to the arbitrator's decision to strike certain allegations from the arbitration demand and identify four "Non-Arbitrable Disputes". The plaintiff seeks to file an amended complaint to assert claims related to these non-arbitrable claims before they become time-barred. The defendant, Joseph Duerr, opposes the motion, arguing that the plaintiff cannot amend the complaint while a stay is in effect. The court rules that the motion is denied, citing the lack of authority for amending a complaint while a stay is in place.
