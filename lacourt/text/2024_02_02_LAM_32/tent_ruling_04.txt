ANDRE NESBIT,
                        Plaintiff,
            v.
 
CHIPOTLE, 
                        Defendant.
  


 
  Case No.:  23STCV11201
  Hearing Date:  February 2, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant’s motion to set aside default
  and recall writ of execution 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On May 18, 2023, Plaintiff Andre
Nesbit filed this action against Defendant Chipotle, alleging negligence per
se. Plaintiff alleges that he faced racially discriminatory treatment when
attempting to place an order at a Chipotle restaurant. 
            After multiple rejected proofs of
service, Plaintiff filed a proof of service on October 26, 2023, which was
accepted. The October 26 filing purports to have effectuated personal service
of the summons and complaint on Defendant through an unnamed “Agent Authorized
to Accept Service” on July 13, 2023. The proof of service is signed by an
individual named Eugene Foy, who is not a registered process server. 
            On November 20, 2023, the Court
granted default judgment for Plaintiff against Defendant in the amount of
$25,000. A writ of execution was issued on December 28, 2023 in the amount of
$25,040.    
            On January 12, 2024, Defendant filed
the instant motion to set aside the default and recall the writ of execution.
Plaintiff filed his opposition on January 18, 2024. Defendant filed its reply
on January 26, 2024. On January 26 and 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed an amended response
and second amended response in opposition to the motion, which are improper and
will not be considered. 
LEGAL STANDARD
“The court may, upon motion of the injured
party, or its own motion, correct clerical mistakes in its judgment or orders
as entered, so as to conform to the judgment or order directed, and may, on
motion of either party after notice to the other party, set aside any void
judgment or order.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473(d).) Additionally, “[w]hen service
of a summons has not resulted in actual notice to a party in time to defend the
action and a default or default judgment has been entered against him or her in
the action, he or she may serve and file a notice of motion to set aside the
default or default judgment and for leave to defend the action.” (Id., §
473.5.) 
Because the law favors resolution on the
merits, doubts are resolved in favor of the party requesting relief, and only “slight
evidence” is needed to justify relief. (Caldwell v. Methodist Hospital
(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1521, 1524.) “[C]ourts have often granted relief pursuant
to the discretionary relief provision of section 473 if no prejudice to the
opposing party will ensue.” (Comunidad en Accion v. Los Angeles City Council
(2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1132-1133.)
DISCUSSION
“[A] default judgment entered against a
defendant who was not served with a summons in the manner prescribed by statute
is void.” (Ellard v. Conway (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 540, 544.) “Under
section 473, subdivision (d), the court may set aside a default judgment which
is valid on its face, but void, as a matter of law, due to improper service.” (Ibid.)
A corporation may be served by delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to:
(a) the designated agent for service of process; or (b) the
president, chief executive officer, or other head of the corporation, a vice
president, a secretary or assistant secretary, a treasurer or assistant
treasurer, a controller or chief financial officer, a general manager, or a
person authorized by the corporation to receive service of process. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 416.10.) 
The October 26, 2023 proof of service
claims personal service on Defendant by delivering the summons and complaint to
an unnamed African-American male at a Chipotle restaurant located at 601 W. 7th
St., Los Angeles, CA 90017. The service was purportedly effectuated on July 13,
2023 at 12:00pm. 
Defendant’s agent for service of process is
CSC – Lawyers Incorporating Service, located in Sacramento, California. (Green
Decl. ¶ 5.) There is no indication that the unnamed individual identified in
the proof of service was a person authorized to accept service on behalf of Defendant.
(See Code Civ. Proc., § 416.10.) Moreover, surveillance footage from the
restaurant location revealed that there was no African-American male cashier
working that day and that there was no attempted service at all upon any employee.
(Green Decl. ¶ 30.) Defendant did not discover the lawsuit until January 8,
2024. (Id., ¶ 7.) 
Plaintiff does not dispute Defendant’s
evidence, which shows that service was not performed in the manner required by statute
and was in fact not performed at all. In his opposition, Plaintiff argues that
service was performed in multiple ways and attaches two of the
previously-rejected proofs of service. As discussed above, the only proof of
service accepted by the Court was the one filed on October 26, 2023. The proofs
attached to Plaintiff’s opposition are invalid on their face because they indicate
that Plaintiff served the summons and complaint himself rather than utilizing a
nonparty.  
The Court finds that the proof of service
and Plaintiff’s contentions are not credible and that Defendant was not
properly served. Therefore, the judgment is void and must be set aside. (See
Code Civ. Proc., § 473(d); Ellard, supra, 94 Cal.App.4th at p. 544.) Additionally,
the facts established above demonstrate that Defendant lacked actual notice of
the lawsuit, which is an independent ground for relief. (See Code Civ. Proc., §
473.5.) 
CONCLUSION
            Defendant’s motion to set aside
default and recall writ of execution is GRANTED.
