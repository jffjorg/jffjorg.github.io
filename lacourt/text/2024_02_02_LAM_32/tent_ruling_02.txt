     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion for leave to file
  second amended complaint 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On June 29, 2022, Plaintiff Robert
Howard, through his conservator Cynthia Finerty, filed the operative First
Amended Complaint against Defendants Joseph Duerr (“Duerr”) and Realty Advisors
and Asset Managers, Inc. (“RAAM”).  
Plaintiff is the settlor and sole
beneficiary of a trust holding substantial assets. Plaintiff, personally and through
the trust and an LLC, owns various commercial properties throughout California.
Pursuant to a property management agreement in 2007 (“2007 Agreement”),
Plaintiff retained RAAM to manage his and his LLC’s properties. Plaintiff
alleges that the Agreement was designed to take advantage of him and allow
Defendants to embezzle his money. 
The 2007 Agreement contains an arbitration
provision covering any claims arising out of the Agreement. Accordingly,
Defendants moved to compel arbitration, which the Court granted on August 24,
2022, also staying the case in its entirety. Plaintiffs commenced arbitration
on January 9, 2023. On July 13, 2023, the arbitrator denied Plaintiffs’ motion to
dismiss the arbitration but struck certain allegations from the arbitration
demand as non-arbitrable. 
On November 9, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the
instant motion for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint to assert claims
related to the non-arbitrable claims before they become time-barred. Defendants
filed their opposition on January 22, 2024. Plaintiffs filed their reply on
January 26, 2024.  
LEGAL STANDARD
The court may, in furtherance of justice,
and on such terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading. (Code
Civ. Proc, §§ 473, subd. (a), 576.) Courts must apply a policy of liberality in
permitting amendments at any stage of the proceeding, including during trial,
when no prejudice to the opposing party is shown. (Duchrow v. Forrest
(2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1359, 1377.) In determining the extent of prejudice to
the opposing party, the court must consider various factors, such as whether
the amendment would delay trial or increase the discovery burden. (Demetriades
v. Yelp, Inc. (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 294, 306.)
DISCUSSION
            The arbitrator identified four “Non-Arbitrable
Disputes” from Plaintiffs’ arbitration demand: (1) “the alleged improper
payment of monies to Respondents for unlicensed investment advisory, securities
broker-dealer, legal, and accounting services provided to Claimants;” (2) “the
alleged improper payment of monies to Respondents for services rendered to
Claimants under the 2015 Agreement;” (3) “the alleged improper payment of
monies to Respondents for actions taken on behalf of Claimants by Duerr as
trustee of the Trust;” and (4) “the alleged improper payment of monies to
Respondents for actions taken on behalf of Claimants under the Duerr POA.” (Wallen
Decl., Ex. 1, p. 10.) The arbitrator found that these alleged acts were “materially
separate and distinct from the services to be rendered and payments to be made
under the 2007 Agreement” and therefore not covered by the arbitration clause
in the 2007 Agreement. (Ibid.) 
            Plaintiffs seek to file an SAC to
assert claims and allegations related to the Non-Arbitrable Issues (See Mtn.
3:22-4:14.) Plaintiffs also seek to add Defendant Duerr’s son, Christopher Duerr,
as a defendant. Plaintiffs contend that the amendment is proper despite the current
stay because “[i]f the issue which is the controversy subject to arbitration is
severable, the stay may be with respect to that issue only.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1281.4.) Plaintiffs argue that the Non-Arbitrable Disputes were indeed
severed by the arbitrator’s decision. Plaintiffs argue that, although they
would be entitled to do so under Section 1281.4, they are not seeking to lift
the stay to immediately litigate the Non-Arbitrable Disputes. Instead, Plaintiffs
only seek to assert the claims before they become time-barred. Plaintiffs argue
that Defendants will not be prejudiced because no trial date has been set and the
stay will remain in effect. 
            However, Plaintiffs cite no
authority for the proposition that they may amend a complaint while a stay is
in effect. Section 1281.4 does not entitle Plaintiff to file an amended complaint
while a stay is in effect. Section 1281.4 authorizes a court to stay litigation
upon compelling arbitration. It does not authorize the parties to take any
action, including amend a complaint, once a stay is in place. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiffs’ motion for leave to
amend is DENIED.
