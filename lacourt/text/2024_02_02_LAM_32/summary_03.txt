And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion for assignment of payment rights to the extent necessary to satisfy the money judgment. The plaintiff is entitled to an assignment of all payments from M Coach USA to the defendants, as the defendants do not oppose the motion and concede that an assignment is warranted. The court's decision is based on the facts that the defendants have not made payments since the settlement and forbearance agreement, and that the defendants are intentionally diverting assets to prevent them from being used to satisfy the judgment. The court has also taken into account the parties' agreement to settle the judgment and other outstanding loans, as well as the defendants' failure to make payments as agreed. The court's ruling is in accordance with California Code of Civil Procedure, Section 708.510(a), which allows the court to order the judgment debtor to assign to the judgment creditor all or part of a right to payment due or to become due.
