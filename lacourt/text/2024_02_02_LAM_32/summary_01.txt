And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiffs' motion to compel the depositions of Diego Gonzalez and Elena Padilla, and to compel defendants to participate in trial preparation. The court grants the motion to compel depositions, finding that Gonzalez failed to appear for deposition and subsequently stopped communicating with plaintiffs, and that Padilla's deposition was not taken due to bankruptcy proceedings. The court also finds that defendants are required to participate in discovery, even if they are currently pro per. However, the court denies the motion to compel defendants to participate in trial preparation, finding that there is no authority or need for such an order. The court orders that the depositions be taken as previously scheduled, and that defendants participate in discovery as required by law.
