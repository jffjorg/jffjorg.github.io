And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendant, Chipotle, and granted its motion to set aside the default judgment and recall the writ of execution. The judge found that the defendant was not properly served with the summons and complaint, as the proof of service was not credible and did not meet the requirements of the applicable statute. The judge also found that the defendant lacked actual notice of the lawsuit, which is an independent ground for relief. As a result, the judge concluded that the default judgment was void and must be set aside.
