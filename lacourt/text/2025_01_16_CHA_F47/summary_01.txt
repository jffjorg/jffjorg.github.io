And here is a summary of the judge's reasoning in English:

The judge grants the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff's claims for negligent infliction of personal injuries, loss of consortium, and wrongful death are based on the defendant's alleged failure to ensure proper traffic controls at an intersection where a construction project was underway. However, the judge finds that the plaintiff has failed to present any evidence that the defendant's actions or inactions caused or contributed to the accident.

The judge notes that the plaintiff's own witness, the driver of the vehicle in which the decedent was a passenger, testified that her view of oncoming traffic was not obstructed and that she saw the other vehicle involved in the accident at all times before the collision. The judge also finds that the construction project and road maintenance did not create a visual obstruction that would have prevented the driver from seeing the other vehicle.

The judge concludes that the plaintiff has not presented any evidence that connects the defendant's services at the intersection to the accident, and that the plaintiff's claims are therefore barred. The judge also denies the plaintiff's request for a continuance, finding that additional evidence or discovery would not change the outcome of the case.
