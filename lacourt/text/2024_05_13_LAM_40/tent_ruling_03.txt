  Mutualista De San Jose’s Demurrer to Complaint



 
I. Background
A. Pleadings
Pursuant to a December 6, 2023
Complaint, Plaintiff Rafael Davila Madrigal, aka Rafael Davila, individually
and doing business as 4 Wheel Auto Dismantler, and dba 4 Wheel Truck & Van
Dismantlers (Davila Madrigal), and Alicia Brisila Davila (Brisila Davila)—both
in pro per (collectively, the Davila Parties)—sue Defendants Union Mutualista
De San Jose (Union Mutualista), Paulino Lopez (Lopez) as President of Union
Mutualista, Rafael Barraza as President of Union Mutualista (Barraza), and Does
1 through 20.
(The Court refers to Plaintiffs
Davila Madrigal and Brisila Davila as the “Davila Parties” for ease of
reference where the parties stand both as plaintiffs and defendants, and where
the Plaintiffs in the lead action share this surname.)
The Complaint alleges claims of (1)
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED) and (2) Breach of Unfair
Business Practices Act, § 17200.
The claims arise from allegations
that the Davila Parties leased commercial premises from Defendants for the
purpose of operating a car dismantling business and that Defendants engaged in
conduct amounting to IIED and unfair business practices by: (1) increasing the
Davila Parties’ monthly rent from $2,000 to $2,500 and then from $2,500 to
$5,000 per month, with the dates of those increases not specifically alleged,
for the purpose of vacating the property quickly for sale; and (2) demanding
that the Davila Parties vacate the premises with only a month’s notice despite
being on notice that the Davila Parties needed more time to remove heavy
equipment from the premises, including the relocating of the Davila Parties’
car parts, heavy machinery, containers, recycling equipment and machinery,
multi-dismantling machinery and equipment, vehicles, trucks, and car rim
crushers, etc.
B. Related Case
On December 28, 2023, the Davila
Parties—in pro per—filed a notice of related case identifying 23LBUD02282, Union
Mutualista De San Jose v. Davila Madrigal, et al. (the Unlawful Detainer or
UD Action), and 23STCV29782, Davila Madrigal, et al. v. Union Mutualista De
San Jose, et al. (this, the Civil Action) as related cases.
On January 4, 2024, Department S13
of the South District, Deukmejian Court, granted a motion for summary
adjudication filed by Union Mutualista in relation to the second cause of
action in the UD Action.
On January 12, 2024, the Court
related these actions, made the Civil Action the lead case, and assigned the
two actions to this Court for all purposes.
On February 15, 2024, Union
Mutualista filed an ex parte application seeking entry of judgment in the UD
Action following its successful motion for summary adjudication.
On February 20, 2024, the Court
entered the proposed judgment in the UD Action.
C. Demurrer Before
the Court
On January 30, 2024, after this
Court related the UD Action and the Civil Action but before Union Mutualista
filed its ex parte application—Union Mutualista filed a demurrer in the Civil
Action as against Plaintiffs’ Complaint. The demurrer principally argues that
the Complaint’s claims in the Civil Action arise from conduct protected by the
litigation privilege—i.e., filing the UD Action and raising the rent on the
commercial property once the lease had terminated—which is not actionable
conduct.
The demurrer attaches proof of
service showing service of the demurrer on Rafael Davila Madrigal and Alicia
Brisila Davila by regular mail.
No opposition appears in the
record.
Union Mutualista’s demurrer is now
before the Court.
 
II. Requests for Judicial Notice
Per Union Mutualista’s request, the
Court takes judicial notice of the January 4, 2024, summary adjudication
minutes and the January 8, 2024, proposed order relating to the January 4th
order. (Demurrer, RJN, p. 2, Exs. 1-2.)
 
III. Demurrer
A.
Legal Standard
A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.
(Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747; see Code Civ. Proc., §
430.10, subd. (e).)
To
sufficiently allege a cause of action, a complaint must allege all the ultimate
facts—that is, the facts needed to establish each element of the cause of
action pleaded. (Committee on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods
Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 212, superseded by statute as stated in Branick
v. Downey Savings & Loan Assn. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 235, 242.) “[E]ach
evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need
not be alleged.” (C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012)
53 Cal.4th 861, 872.)
In
testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth
of all material facts properly pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist.
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-67.) Courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006)
144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228, disapproved on other grounds, Jones v. Lodge at
Torrey Pines Partnership (2008) 42 Cal.4th 1158, 1162.) A demurrer,
however, “does not admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or
law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.) 
B.
Court’s Determination
1. Demurrer,
Complaint, First Cause of Action, Emotional Distress: SUSTAINED, with
leave to amend.
The Court finds in favor of Union
Mutualista.
To determine the nature of a cause
of action, California courts look at the facts alleged, not its label. (See,
e.g., Saunders v. Cariss (1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 905, 908.) Here, the
first cause of action alleged in Plaintiffs’ pro per Complaint is “emotional
distress,” which appears to connote an intentional infliction of emotional
distress (IIED) claim. (See, e.g., Complaint, ¶ 27 [“… extreme and outrageous …”].)

The Complaint’s IIED claim is
premised on two grounds. The first is that, in order to sell the property that
Plaintiffs are leasing from Union Mutualista, Union Mutualista raised
Plaintiffs’ rent on the commercial property after Plaintiff’s lease ended
(holdover tenants paying rent from month to month), with rent raised from
$2,000 to $2,500 and then from $2,500 to $5,000. The second is that Union
Mutualista filed the UD action for the same reason, i.e., to force a quick
vacatur of the property for sale purposes. (Complaint, ¶¶ 25-26.)
Union Mutualista argues that the
filing of the UD Action is protected by the litigation privilege, and the Court
agrees.
The litigation privilege applies to
IIED claims. (Action Apartment Assn., Inc. v. City of Santa Monica
(2007) 41 Cal.4th 1232, 1242.)
The litigation privilege also
applies to the filing of an unlawful detainer action. (Birkner v. Lam
(2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 275, 281.)
Thus, to the extent that the IIED
claim relies on the filing of the UD Action as actionable conduct, such a claim
is deficient as a matter of law, particularly where the UD Action was resolved
in Union Mutualista’s favor. (Complaint, ¶ 25.)
Union Mutualista also argues that
the raised rent allegations do not support an IIED claim where it is not clear
from the face of the Complaint why raising the rent was a prohibited action in
relation to Plaintiffs’ commercial lease. The Court agrees.
The Complaint fails to allege, for
example, whether rent increases were prohibited by the parties’ agreements or
local ordinance. Indeed, the Complaint instead alleges that when Union
Mutualista increased rent on the property, Plaintiffs’ lease agreement had expired,
i.e., they were holdover tenants. (Complaint, ¶ 11.) Moreover, the Complaint
alleges that Plaintiffs accepted the rent increase and did not dispute it. (Complaint,
¶ 12.) Thus, no basis is alleged for why the rent increases were prohibited and
such contention is merely a legal conclusion.
The Complaint does allege that the
purpose of raising rent and filing the UD Action was to pressure Plaintiffs to
vacate the property so that Union Mutualista could sell it quickly. (Complaint,
¶¶ 13-20.) However, given that the Complaint alleges that Plaintiffs were
holdover tenants, it is not clear from the face of the Complaint whether Union
Mutualista’s desire to quickly sell the property amounts to actionable conduct
given that Plaintiffs appear to have only been month-to-month tenants at the
commercial property.
Union Mutualista’s demurrer is thus
SUSTAINED, with leave to amend.
2. Demurrer,
Complaint, Second Cause of Action, Unfair Business Practices: SUSTAINED,
with leave to amend.
The second cause of action for
unfair business practices is based on the same facts as the first cause of
action for IIED. (Complaint, ¶ 31.) To state a claim under the Business and Professions
Code section 17200, a party must identify an unfair business practice. And “[a]lthough
the unfair competition law's scope is sweeping, it is not unlimited.” (Cel-Tech
Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. (1999) 20
Cal.4th 163, 182].) Nor may a party avoid the bar of the litigation privilege
by alleging an action under section 17200 where the conduct is the same. (Ibid.)
 As explained above, no specific explanation why
the conduct of defendants was wrongful has been identified. For this reason,
the Court adopts its IIED discussion to SUSTAIN Union Mutualista’s demurrer to
the derivative claim of unfair business practices.
IV. Conclusion
Defendant Union Mutualista De San
Jose’s Demurrer to Complaint is SUSTAINED, with leave to amend within 20 days
of this Order. Failure to timely do so may result in dismissal of the action.
