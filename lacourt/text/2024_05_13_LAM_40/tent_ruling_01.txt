 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Plaintiffs’ Motion
  to Compel Further Discovery Responses from Defendant, and Request for
  Sanctions – First Set of Request for Production of Documents.



 
I. Background
A. Pleadings
Plaintiffs Jorge Hernandez Camacho
and Sara Martinez sue Defendants Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., Inc. (Toyota USA)
and Does 1 through 10 pursuant to a May 18, 2023, Complaint alleging claims of
(1) Violation of the Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty, (2)
Violation of the Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Implied Warranty, and (3)
Violation of the Song-Beverly Act Section 1793.2.
The claims arise from the following
allegations. On February 16, 2019, Plaintiffs purchased a 2019 Toyota Corolla
(the Vehicle), pursuant to which Toyota USA and Plaintiffs entered express and
implied warranties. According to those warranties, Toyota USA would conform any
defects that arose in the Vehicle within the warranty period within a
reasonable number of attempts or instead repurchase or replace the Vehicle.
However, the Vehicle later manifested defects and nonconformities within the
applicable warranty period, which Toyota USA was unable to repair or conform to
warranty after a reasonable number of attempts, with Toyota USA also refusing
to repurchase or replace the Vehicle.
B. Motion Before the
Court
On February 5, 2024,
Plaintiffs filed a motion to compel further responses to certain requests in
Plaintiffs’ first set of production discovery served on Toyota USA (RPDs, Set
One). Plaintiffs’ motion attaches a separate statement.
On May 6, 2024,
Plaintiffs filed a notice of non-opposition that noticed Toyota USA’s failure
to file an opposition to Plaintiffs’ motion.
On May 7, 2024, Toyota
USA filed an ex parte application for an order allowing Toyota USA to file an
opposition to Plaintiffs’ motion.
That same day,
Plaintiffs filed an opposition to Toyota USA’s ex parte application.
On May 8, 2024, Toyota
USA filed a reply to Plaintiffs’ opposition.
That same day, the Court
granted Toyota USA’s ex parte application, which allowed Toyota USA to file an
opposition by May 8, 2024, at midnight, and Plaintiffs to file a reply by May
10, 2024, at noon.
On May 9, 2024—one
court day late—Toyota USA filed an opposition to Plaintiff’s motion. The
opposition fails to attach a separate statement.
On May 10, 2024,
Plaintiffs filed a reply to Toyota USA’s opposition.
Plaintiffs’ motion is
now before the Court.
 
II. Motion to Compel Further
Production and Request for Sanctions
A.
Admonishment
The
Court notes that Toyota USA and counsel repeatedly citing unpublished,
uncitable California opinions in its opposition papers, contrary to the Rules
of Court. (Opp’n, p. 12; see Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.1115(a), (b).) Such authority
will not be considered.
B.
Motion to Compel Further Production: GRANTED, in part.
1. Legal Standard
A
motion to compel a further response is used when a party gives unsatisfactory
answers or makes untenable objections to interrogatories, demands to produce,
or requests for admission. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a); Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)
To
request further production, a movant must establish: (1) good cause for the
production (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1); Sinaiko, supra,
at p. 403); and (2) that a further response is needed because (a) the
responding party’s statement of compliance with the demand to produce is
incomplete Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(1)), (b) the responding
party’s representation that it is unable to comply is inadequate, complete, or
evasive (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(2)), (c) the responding party’s
objection in the response is without merit or is too general (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.310, subd. (a)(3); Catalina Island Yacht Club v. Superior Court
(2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1127), or (d) if the responding party objected to
the production of ESI on the ground that it is not reasonably accessible the
movant can show that the (i) ESI is reasonably accessible or (ii) there is good
cause for production of the ESI regardless of its accessibility (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (e)).
2. Court’s Determination

The Court finds in favor of Plaintiffs,
in part.
The Court notes that it considers
the opposition though it was filed late because the reply fails to address any
prejudice arising from the late service of the opposition. (Arambula v.
Union Carbide Corp. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 333, 343; see Carlton v.
Quint (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 690, 697; Reedy v. Bussell (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 1272, 1288.) However, the Court strongly encourages counsel for the
defendants to be more careful in calendaring, given that this Opposition was
filed after the due date was already long past and should have been prepared
and ready to go in the event the Court granted the ex parte to file a late Opposition.
The Court will not condone repeated violations of the rules.
a. RPDs, Set
One, Nos. 18, 20, 21, 24-27, 29-32, 37-41, and 45-46
Critical to the Court’s ruling is
an understanding of the evidence presented by Toyota USA in connection with its
opposition.
Toyota USA attaches excerpts of Plaintiff
Jorge Hernandez Camacho’s deposition transcript. The transcript reflects that
Plaintiff Hernandez Camacho has testified to the following effect:
(1) Plaintiff Hernandez Camacho apparently
only presented the subject vehicle to an authorized dealership for repair a
single time (see Mot., Ex. D, 142:8-10, 145:8-11);
(2) The visit to the authorized
dealership for repair was spurred by Toyota USA issuing an interim recall
notice, which Plaintiffs received, and which prompted Plaintiff Hernandez
Camacho to present the vehicle for repair (Mot, Ex. C, 86:22-25);
(3) Plaintiff Hernandez Camacho had
no complaints or issues with the subject vehicle prior to presenting the
vehicle to an authorized dealership in response to the interim recall notice
(Mot., Ex. C, 85:23-86:1 & Ex. D, 142:8-11);
(4) Prior to and after the visit to
the authorized dealership for repair, Plaintiff Hernandez Camacho did not
experience any issues with the vehicle’s airbags, seal belt pretensioners,
stalling, or low pressure—i.e., the issues raised in the interim recall notice
(Mot., Ex. D, 142:12-143:21); and
(5) Plaintiff Hernandez Camacho had
no complaints or issues with the subject vehicle after presenting the vehicle
to an authorized dealership in response to the interim recall notice (Mot., Ex.
D, 145:8-11).
The Song-Beverly Act “give[s]
recourse to the buyer of a new automobile that suffers from the same defect
repeatedly, or is out of service for cumulative repairs for an extended
period.” (Krotin v. Porsche Cars North America, Inc. (1995) 38
Cal.App.4th 294, 301 (Krotin).)
Here, the evidence presented by
Toyota USA and cited above shows that Plaintiff Hernandez Camacho only
presented the Vehicle for a single repair visit to a Toyota and that Plaintiff
Hernandez Camacho did not have any complaints regarding the vehicle’s condition
before or after presenting the vehicle for repair in response to the interim
call notice. If this is correct, then no relief  appears to be available under the SBA based on
“the buyer of a new automobile … suffer[ing] from the same defect repeatedly.”
(Ibid.)
As for whether the vehicle was “out
of service for cumulative repairs for an extended period of time” (ibid.),
the Court notes that the majority of the discovery at issue here does not
appear geared toward this question. (Mot., Separate Statement, RPDs, Set One, Nos.
18, 20, 21, 24-27, 29-32, 37-41, and 45-46.) Instead, those production requests
are geared toward discovering information pertinent to overall defects in
Toyota Corollas of the same year. Moreover, the opposition papers argue that
the four-month repair visit in this case—exceeding the 30-day limit (Civ. Code,
§ 1793.2, subd. (b)—was a result of parts unavailability. (Mot., p. 5, citing
Mot., Ex. D, 146:11-147:2.) These circumstances connote a “[d]elay caused by
conditions beyond the control of the manufacturer or its representatives,” seemingly
amounting to circumstances that may “extend th[e] 30-day requirement” for
reasonable repairs. (Civ. Code, § 1793.2, subd. (b).) Last, a single visit to a
repair facility in response to a recall notice does not appear to support an
SBA claim here. (See, Gutierrez v. Carmax Auto Superstores (2018) 19
Cal.App.5th 1234, 1248 [In allegedly-defective-lamp case not arising from the
SBA, “the existence of a safety recall does not adequately allege a substantial
safety hazard existed”].) 
Neither
does the reply rebut the opposition’s characterization of Plaintiff Hernandez
Camacho’s deposition testimony, which is fatal for the discovery here. This is
because information is relevant only if it might reasonably help a party
evaluate a case, prepare for trial, or facilitate a settlement. (See TBG
Ins. Servs. v. Superior Court (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 443, 448.) It is not
clear here how responses to RPDs, Set One, Nos. 18, 20, 21, 24-27, 29-32,
37-41, and 45-46 will assist Plaintiffs in evaluating the case, preparing for
trial, or facilitating a settlement. This is because a threshold determination
for discovery in SBA actions is whether more than one repair occurred (here,
only one occurred) and whether the vehicle was out of service for an
unreasonable amount of time (seemingly not the case here based on the need for
extra time to receive the pars to be installed in the vehicle in response to
the recall).
It is worth noting that the opposition
papers characterize the subject vehicle as being solely used by Plaintiff
Hernandez Camacho. (Mot., pp. 1, 3.) However, no direct evidence attached to
the opposition papers supports that argument. On the other hand, Plaintiffs’
reply does not refute the opposition’s framing of Plaintiff Hernandez Camacho
as the sole driver of the vehicle, which would make him the sole person who
would be aware of problems arising from the operation of the vehicle. 
Separately, even if Sara Martinez
also drove the subject vehicle, Plaintiffs’ reply does not dispute the
deposition testimony presented by Toyota USA, as discussed above. Indeed,
Plaintiffs merely argue that “whether … there is any ‘basis for Plaintiffs’
Song-Beverly Claims’ is not what is before the Court in this Motion” and that
“Defendant can make these arguments in a motion for summary judgement should it
go to the trouble to file one,” for which reasons “the Court should not
consider this argument as it has no applicability to the instant Motion.”
(Reply, p. 2.) This argument fails because the intent of Toyota USA’s
opposition is not to summarily dispose of this action in a discovery motion,
but rather, to highlight that the information requested by Plaintiffs is
irrelevant where Plaintiff Hernandez Camacho has given damaging testimony that appears
to take this action outside of the SBA’s ambit.
Neither does the reply attach
evidence showing that the vehicle was presented for repair to authorized Toyota
USA dealerships more than once, which the Court could have considered for the
first time on reply for good cause, i.e., the need to rebut the opposition’s
deposition evidence. (Nordstrom Com. Cases (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 576, 583 [courts
generally need not accept arguments raised for the first time on reply without
good cause explanation as to why points were not raised earlier].)
Last, the
Court notes that RPDs, Set One, Nos. 39-41 are overbroad. Requests No. 39 and
41 are not confined to repair codes germane to the issues for which the vehicle
was presented for repair (the recalls). Request No. 40 requests all customer
complaints from 2019 to the present, which is discovery not limited to vehicles
of the same year, make, and model as the subject vehicle or to vehicles with
similar components even if not the same year, make, and model.
For these
reasons—lack of relevance, and in parts, overbreadth—Plaintiffs’ motion is
DENIED as to compelling further responses to RPDs, Set One, Nos. 18, 20, 21,
24-27, 29-32, 37-41, and 45-46.
b. RPDs, Set
One, Nos. 15, 17
However, the Court GRANTS
Plaintiff’s motion as to RPDs, Set One, Nos. 15 and 17.
These production requests are
relevant to showing the applicable warranties on the Vehicle and the repair
manual for the subject vehicle. Such information is eminently relevant where
the pleadings allege breach of various warranties for lack of proper repair and
where the four-month repair may still support an SBA claim.
Toyota USA’s objections to these
production requests are unavailing. As for equal availability (RPDs, Set One,
Nos. 15, 17), the Court rejects this objection. The Code does not provide a
wholesale exception for “equal availability.” Instead, the proper test is found
in Code of Civil Procedure section 2019.030, which permits limitations to
discovery where the “discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or
duplicative, or is obtainable from some other source that is more convenient,
less burdensome, or less expensive.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2019.030, subd.
(a)(1).) Here, Toyota made an insufficient showing that these documents can be
obtained from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or
less expensive. This is because even though Toyota USA refers Plaintiff to its
website in response to both these production requests, such a referral is not
any more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive where Toyota USA’s
responses merely refer Plaintiffs to “Toyota.com” or to the public domain in
search for this information.
For these reasons, Plaintiffs’
motion is GRANTED as to compelling further responses to RPDs, Set One, Nos. 15
and 17.
C. Request for Sanctions: DENIED.
The Court DENIES sanctions for two
reasons. First, Plaintiff’s motion was only granted in small part, specifically
as to two production requests alone. Second, given that Toyota USA was for the
most part justified in opposing these requests, the imposition of sanctions
would not be commensurate to the results of this motion. 
III. Conclusion
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel
Further Discovery Responses from Defendant, and Request for Sanctions – First
Set of Request for Production of Documents is:
(1) GRANTED as to compelling
further responses to RPDs, Set One, Nos. 18, 20, 21, 24-27, 29-32, 37-41, and
45-46 from Defendant Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., Inc.;
(1) DENIED as to compelling further
responses to RPDs, Set One, Nos. 15 and 17 from Defendant Toyota Motor Sales
U.S.A., Inc.; and
(3) DENIED as to sanctions.
Defendant Toyota Motor Sales
U.S.A., Inc. is ORDERED to provide further responses to RPDs, Set One, Nos. 15
and 17 within fourteen days of this order.
