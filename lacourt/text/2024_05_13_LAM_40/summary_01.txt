English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants in part the motion to compel further discovery responses from defendant Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., Inc. regarding the first set of requests for production of documents (RPDs, Set One, Nos. 18, 20, 21, 24-27, 29-32, 37-41, and 45-46). The court finds that these requests are irrelevant and overbroad.

However, the court grants the motion as to RPDs, Set One, Nos. 15 and 17, which are relevant to showing the applicable warranties on the vehicle and the repair manual for the subject vehicle.

The court denies the request for sanctions, as the motion was only granted in small part, and the defendant was justified in opposing these requests.
