And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendants' motion to compel arbitration of the dispute between the parties. The court finds that the defendants have met their burden to show the existence of agreements to arbitrate the controversy, and the plaintiff has not shown that the agreements are unenforceable or invalid. The court orders the parties to arbitrate the claims alleged in the plaintiff's complaint, and the court action is stayed pending the completion of arbitration. The court sets an order to show cause for hearing on May 21, 2024, to ensure that the arbitration is completed in a timely manner.
