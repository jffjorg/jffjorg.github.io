[Tentative]
  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion to compel further
  responses to requests for production of documents
 



 
Motion to
Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production of Documents
Plaintiff Roya Ranjbari (“Plaintiff”) filed the pending motion to
compel further responses to requests for production of documents on February
16, 2022, moving the court for an order (1) compelling defendant Liberty Mutual
Fire Insurance Company (“Defendant”) to provide further responses to
Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, and (2) awarding
sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant. 
On January 18, 2023, the court issued an order granting Defendant’s
motion to stay proceedings pending appeal and ordered that this action is
stayed pending completion of Plaintiff’s appeal of the court’s May 10, 2022
order denying the petition to set aside or vacate the arbitration award.  In the Joint Status Conference Report filed
on July 21, 2023, the parties informed the court that the appeal was still
pending and that they anticipate that oral argument will not be scheduled
before January 2024. 
Pursuant to the court’s January 18, 2023 order staying this action,
the court orders that the hearing on plaintiff Roya Ranjbari’s motion to compel
further responses to requests for production of documents, filed on February
16, 2022, is vacated, subject to being rescheduled if the stay is lifted. 
The court orders Plaintiff to give notice of this order.  
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  October 23, 2023
