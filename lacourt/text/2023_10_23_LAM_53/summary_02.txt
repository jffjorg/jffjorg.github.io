And here is a summary in English text of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Gladys Hampton v. Department of Motor Vehicles. The defendant has filed a demurrer to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint, arguing that it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The judge has sustained the demurrer, finding that the plaintiff has not alleged facts establishing a physical or mental disability, as required by the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA). The court has also found that the plaintiff has not alleged facts establishing an adverse employment action, and that the claims of harassment and retaliation are insufficient. The judge has granted the plaintiff 20 days to file a Second Amended Complaint that cures the deficiencies identified in the ruling.
