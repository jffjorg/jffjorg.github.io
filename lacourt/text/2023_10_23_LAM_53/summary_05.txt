The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving an arbitration agreement and a class action waiver. The agreement provides that its enforcement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), and the court finds that the FAA applies. The judge notes that the plaintiff does not dispute the applicability of the FAA. The judge intends to enforce the arbitration agreement and dismiss the class actions. The ruling is based on the arbitration agreement and the case Victrola 89, LLC v. Jaman Properties 8 LLC (2020), which holds that when an agreement provides for enforcement under the FAA, the FAA governs a party's motion to compel arbitration.
