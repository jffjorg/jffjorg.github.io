The first arbitration agreement that is the subject of this motion provides
that some of its provisions are to be enforced or submitted pursuant to the
Federal Arbitration Act.  (Ambriz Decl.,
Ex. A, pp. 1-2, ¶¶ 4 [“the Employer may lawfully seek enforcement of this
Agreement and the Class Action Waiver under the Federal Arbitration Act and
seek dismissal of such class, collective or representative actions or claims”],
7 [arbitration will be binding under the Federal Arbitration Act].)  The court therefore finds that the Federal
Arbitration Act applies, and Plaintiff does not dispute the applicability
thereof.  (Victrola 89, LLC v. Jaman Properties 8 LLC (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 337, 346 [“when an agreement provides that its
‘enforcement’ shall be governed by the FAA, the FAA governs a party’s motion to
compel arbitration”].)
