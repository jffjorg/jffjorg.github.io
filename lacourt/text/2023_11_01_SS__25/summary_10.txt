And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Petition to Compel Arbitration filed by Sandra Cohen, the petitioner, against Xsiavosh Asrabadi and Bahreh Qmarsi, the respondents. The petition seeks an order compelling the respondents to arbitrate a controversy arising from a California Residential Purchase Agreement entered into by the parties in August 2020.

The judge has found that the petition is unclear regarding the form of relief requested and has denied the petition without prejudice. The petitioner was ordered to file supplemental papers clarifying whether she is moving for an order compelling arbitration or whether she wishes to proceed with mediation. However, the petitioner failed to timely provide these supplemental papers.

The judge has also found that the petitioner has presented a valid arbitration agreement and has shown that it has attempted to mediate the dispute, but the respondents have not been responsive. Nevertheless, the petition is denied without prejudice, and the parties are directed to proceed with mediation and arbitration in accordance with the terms of the agreement.
