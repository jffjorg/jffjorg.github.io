And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Creditors Adjustment Bureau, Inc. v. Ronnie M Perez. The plaintiff, Creditors Adjustment Bureau, has filed two motions to compel responses to its discovery requests, which were propounded on May 4, 2023. The defendant, Ronnie M Perez, failed to respond to these requests, and no opposition was filed to the motions.

The judge has GRANTED both motions to compel responses. The defendant is ORDERED to provide code-compliant and objection-free responses to the discovery requests within 20 days from the notice of the ruling. The plaintiff's request for sanctions is also GRANTED. The defendant is ORDERED to pay sanctions in the amount of $822.75 within 30 days from the notice of the ruling.

The judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure and California Rules of Court, which require parties to respond to discovery requests in a timely manner. The judge found that the defendant failed to respond to the discovery requests and therefore waived its objections to the requests. The judge also found that the plaintiff's motions are substantively similar and will be heard at a single hearing, and therefore reduced the total number of hours requested by the plaintiff's counsel for each motion to 1.5 hours.
