And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion to vacate the judgment rendered on July 10, 2023. The Plaintiff seeks to set aside and vacate the judgment and have the Court enter a new and different judgment. However, the judge finds that the Plaintiff's motion is a disguised motion for reconsideration, not a proper motion for relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 663. The judge also notes that the action was previously dismissed with prejudice on November 22, 2022, and that the Plaintiff has failed to comply with California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1113. The judge concludes that the Plaintiff has not shown any grounds for relief under section 663 and that the motion is therefore denied.
