The FAC  alleges that Yoselin Gaxiola had a policy of insurance with Plaintiff, covering  the damages that are the subject of this action. Plaintiff paid the claim to  the insured as required by the policy. Plaintiff now seeks subrogation of its  payment from Defendant in the amount of $17,981.84.    On May 17, 2023, default judgments were entered against  Defendants.    On July 21, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to set  aside judgment, set aside default, and dismiss. On September 20, 2023, the  Court continued the hearing to November 1, 2023. To date, no opposition has  been filed.   MOVING PARTY  POSITION   On May 17, 2023, a default judgment was entered in favor of  Plaintiff and against Defendants in the amount of $20,875.09. Subsequently,  upon Plaintiff serving notice of the entry of judgment, the parties met and  conferred, thereafter agreeing upon a settlement of the matter. Plaintiff now  seeks to set aside the judgment and entry of default entered in this matter and  then dismiss the matter with prejudice  OPPOSITION   None. REPLY   None.   ANALYSIS   I.          Motion to Set Aside/Vacate Judgment A.                 Legal Standard  Code of Civil Procedure, section 187 states: “[w]hen jurisdiction is, by the Constitution or this  Code, or by any other statute, conferred on a Court or judicial officer, all  the means necessary to carry it into effect are also given; and in the exercise  of this jurisdiction, if the course of proceeding be not specifically pointed  out by this Code or the statute, any suitable process or mode of proceeding may  be adopted which may appear most conformable to the spirit of this code.”  “Section 187 contemplates amending a judgment by  noticed motion. [Citations.] The court is not required to hold an evidentiary  hearing on a motion to amend a judgment, but may rule on the motion based  solely on declarations and other written evidence. [Citation.]” (Highland  Springs Conference & Training Center v. City of Banning (2016) 244  Cal.App.4th 267, 280.) “In the interests of justice, the ‘‘‘greatest  liberality is to be encouraged’’’ in the allowance of amendments brought  pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 187. [Citation.]” (Wells Fargo  Bank, N.A. v. Weinberg (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 1, 7.)    B.                  Analysis   On May 17, 2023, a default  judgment was entered in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendants in the amount  of $20,875.09. Subsequently, upon Plaintiff serving notice of the entry of  judgment, the parties met and conferred, thereafter agreeing upon a settlement  of the matter. (Reese Decl. ¶¶ 3-5.) Plaintiff requests that the Court set  aside the judgment and entry of default entered in this matter and then dismiss  the matter with prejudice. “In the exercise of equitable jurisdiction the court  undoubtedly has broad discretionary powers to take whatever action is necessary  in the interests of justice in order that its decrees will not fail to  accomplish their purpose.” (Del Riccio v. Superior Court of Cal., in and for  Los Angeles County (1952) 115 Cal.App.2d 29, 31.) The Court finds that setting  aside default and dismissing the case is in the interests of justice. “The  strong policy favoring settlement  of litigation supports [this] conclusion.” (In re Marriage of Assemi  (1994) 7 Cal.4th 896, 910.)   III.       Conclusion    For the  foregoing reasons, Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company’s  Motion to Set Aside/Vacate the Default Judgment entered on 05/14/2023 is GRANTED.  The action is dismissed with prejudice.   Moving party is ordered to  give notice
