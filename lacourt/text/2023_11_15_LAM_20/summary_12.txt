And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendant, 701 Pacific, LLC, and a motion to strike filed by the defendants Ned Bassin, Rosalind S. Bassin, and The Bassin Family Trust. The demurrer was filed in response to the plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint, which alleges eight causes of action, including negligence, breach of warranty of habitability, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The defendant argued that the complaint was a sham, that only the plaintiffs specified in the lease have standing, and that the action is collaterally estopped due to a previous stipulated judgment in an unlawful detainer action.

The judge rejected all of the defendant's arguments, finding that the complaint was not a sham, that the waiver of the written consent requirement was alleged, and that the stipulated judgment did not specifically address the plaintiffs' habitability claims. The judge also denied the motion to strike the complaint's references to punitive damages, finding that the plaintiffs had alleged sufficient facts to indicate malice with regard to the defendants' intentional failure to do repairs at the subject premises.

The judge ordered the defendant to file an answer within 20 days and granted the request for judicial notice. The judge also encouraged counsel to submit on the tentative ruling and to appear remotely via LACourtConnect due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
