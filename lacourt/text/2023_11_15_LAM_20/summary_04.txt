And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case, denying the Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The Plaintiff, Deborah Ticey, alleges that she was sexually assaulted as a minor while attending elementary school in 1979-1980. The Defendant, LAUSD, argues that the Plaintiff's claims rely on the retroactive elimination of the government claims requirement by A.B. 218, which is unconstitutional. However, the Judge finds that A.B. 218 does not violate the California Constitution and serves a public purpose by exposing and holding perpetrators of childhood sexual assault responsible. The Judge grants the Requests for Judicial Notice and denies the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings.
