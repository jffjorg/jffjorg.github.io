And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling in a lemon law action where Plaintiff Miguel Hernandez seeks to compel the deposition of Defendant General Motors, LLC's PMK (person or entity providing deposition). The defendant argued that the motion was untimely filed, but the judge found this argument lacks merit due to the circumstances. The judge granted the motion as to certain categories of testimony and documents, including information about vehicle repairs, TSBs, recalls, repurchase, and warranty policies. The judge narrowed the scope of the deposition to only include information related to the subject vehicle and its defects. The judge denied the motion as to certain categories of testimony and documents deemed overbroad and overburdensome. The PMK deposition is scheduled to take place within 30 days, and counsel are encouraged to submit on the tentative or appear by LACourtConnect due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
