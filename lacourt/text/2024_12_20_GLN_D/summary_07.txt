And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has sustained the demurrer filed by defendants David Heislop and Renne Heislop to the complaint filed by plaintiff Avalon Promenade Inc. for unlawful detainer. The plaintiff is a corporation that has been declared in forfeiture by the Franchise Tax Board for failure to pay California state taxes. The defendants have filed a request for judicial notice, which has been granted, showing that on April 2, 2024, the status of the plaintiff was changed from "Active" to "Forfeited—FTB". The plaintiff has failed to submit any further papers to the Court to effect reinstatement of its corporate status, and the Court has therefore sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.
