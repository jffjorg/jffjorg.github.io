As for the summary text:

This tentative ruling concerns the motion to strike the complaint filed by Cole Harris as Successor Trustee of the Harris Family Irrevocable Trust Dated 11/8/11 against Oakhurst Opportunity Lending Fund I, LP. The complaint seeks to quiet title and remove mortgage loans from the subject property in San Marino. The defendant argues that the complaint is unverified and improperly filed, as it was brought by a non-attorney representative of the trust. The court grants the motion to strike the complaint and permits the plaintiff one opportunity to amend the complaint to correct the error. The court also finds that the plaintiff's attempt to bring the action in propria persona is improper, as the interests of the trust must be represented by an attorney. The demurrer is deemed moot in light of the granting of the motion to strike.
