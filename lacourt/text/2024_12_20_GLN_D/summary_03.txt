And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel responses to document requests. The motion was filed by the plaintiff, Brian McShea, against the defendant, Derek Horton. The plaintiff sought to compel the defendant to respond to document requests that were served on August 25, 2024. The defendant failed to serve a proper verified response, and the plaintiff filed a motion to compel responses.

The judge has found that the defendant's failure to respond to the document requests waived any objections they may have had to the requests, and the plaintiff is entitled to sanctions. The judge has awarded the plaintiff $1,250.00 in attorney's fees and costs, plus filing fees of $60.00. The judge has also ordered the defendant to pay the sanctions within 30 days.

The judge has also ruled that the motion to compel responses is moot, as the defendant has since served a proper verified response to the document requests. However, the judge has awarded sanctions to the plaintiff because of the defendant's failure to comply with the discovery requests in a timely manner.
