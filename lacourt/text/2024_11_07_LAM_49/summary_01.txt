And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint filed by the defendants. The defendants demurred to the four causes of action in the complaint, including elder financial abuse, wrongful foreclosure, breach of fiduciary duty, and quiet title. The judge sustained the demurrer in full, except for the First and Second Causes of Action, which were granted 30 days leave to amend. The judge denied leave to amend the Third and Fifth Causes of Action.

The judge's ruling was based on the facts alleged in the complaint, which included the refinancing of the SPS mortgage, the foreclosure of the property, and the recording of the notice of trustee's sale. The judge found that the complaint failed to plead sufficient facts to support the causes of action, particularly with respect to the alleged agency relationship between the Lending Star and Coastal Capital defendants.

The judge also noted that the plaintiff's allegations of elder financial abuse were based on conclusory statements and failed to plead specific facts sufficient to support a cause of action. The judge further found that the quiet title cause of action failed against certain defendants and that the breach of fiduciary duty cause of action was not pled with sufficient particularity.

The judge ordered the plaintiff to file a Third Amended Complaint within 30 days, consistent with this ruling, and ordered the defendants to give notice, unless waived.
