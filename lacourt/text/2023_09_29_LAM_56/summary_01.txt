And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion for summary judgment filed by the defendant, Lisa Marie Vernola Salas, on behalf of the Estate of Luigi Antonio Vernola. The plaintiff, Gracie Smith, is seeking to enforce a letter agreement, dated October 14, 2018, which states that Decedent Luigi Antonio Vernola promised to transfer certain properties to Smith upon his death.

The court has reviewed the evidence and finds that there are no triable issues of material fact regarding the invalidity of the 2018 Letter as a contract for the posthumous transfer of Decedent's property. The court concludes that the plaintiff does not present any evidence to raise a factual dispute over the conclusive presumption of fraud.

Therefore, the court grants the motion and finds that the plaintiff's breach of contract claim is not enforceable. The court orders the moving party to give notice of this ruling and sets a hearing date for December 11, 2023.
