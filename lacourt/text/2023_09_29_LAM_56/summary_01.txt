Here is an English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has considered the motion for summary judgment filed by Lisa Marie Vernola Salas, the defendant and Co-Special Administrator of Luigi Antonio Vernola's estate. The motion is based on the argument that there are no triable issues of material fact regarding the validity of the 2018 Letter, which is the basis of Gracie Smith's claim for breach of contract. The judge has found that the 2018 Letter is not enforceable as a contract for the posthumous transfer of Luigi Antonio Vernola's property, as it was drafted by Gracie Smith and does not meet the requirements of a valid contract. The judge has also found that Gracie Smith has not provided sufficient evidence to raise a factual dispute about the nature of her relationship with Luigi Antonio Vernola or her entitlement to the properties referred to in the 2018 Letter. Therefore, the judge has granted the motion for summary judgment, finding that there are no triable issues of material fact regarding the invalidity of the 2018 Letter as a contract. The plaintiff, Gracie Smith, has not presented sufficient evidence to support her claim for breach of contract, and the defendant, Lisa Marie Vernola Salas, is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

---

This tentative ruling is for a hearing on September 29, 2023, regarding case number 22STCV11799. The case concerns a dispute over the assets of Luigi Antonio Vernola (Decedent). Plaintiff Gracie Smith filed a complaint alleging breach of contract, based on a 2018 Letter in which Decedent promised to bequeath real property to Plaintiff. The motion for summary judgment was filed by Defendant Lisa Marie Vernola Salas, as authorized Co-Special Administrator on behalf of the Estate of Luigi Antonio Vernola, claiming that there are no triable issues of material fact that Plaintiff may not prevail on her breach of contract claim.

The 2018 Letter includes a paragraph stating that certain properties would be transferred to Plaintiff upon Decedent’s death. Plaintiff filed a creditor's claim for the properties referenced in the 2018 Agreement on December 16, 2021, which Moving Defendant denied on January 10, 2022.

The Court has considered the moving, opposition and reply papers. The Court overruled some of the objections to the declarations and sustained others.

The Court finds that there are no triable issues of material fact regarding the invalidity of the 2018 Letter as a contract for the posthumous transfer of Decedent's property. Therefore, the Court grants the motion for summary judgment.
