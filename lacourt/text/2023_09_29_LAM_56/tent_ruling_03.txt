  CASE NO.: 23STCP01780
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: MOTION FOR DEFAULT
 
Date: September 29, 2023
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56



 
MOVING
PARTY:  Petitioner
 
The
Court has considered the moving papers. 
No opposition papers were filed. 
Any opposition papers were required to have been filed and served at
least nine court days before the hearing under California Code of Civil
Procedure (“CCP”) section 1005, subdivision (b).
 
BACKGROUND
            On May 24, 2023, Petitioner filed a complaint to enforce
a mechanic’s lien (the “Complaint”).  On
August 21, 2023, Petitioner filed a motion for default (the “Motion”). 
 
            Neither the Complaint nor the Motion show that Petitioner has executed or
recorded a valid mechanic’s lien.  (See
CCP §§ 8410-8416, 8460-8461.)  Nor
has Petitioner filed a proof of service reflecting service of the
Complaint.  The Court therefore DENIES
the Motion. 
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar. 
 
        Dated this 29th day of September 2023
