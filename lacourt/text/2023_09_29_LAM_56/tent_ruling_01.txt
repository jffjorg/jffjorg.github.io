MOVING
PARTY: Defendant Lisa Marie Vernola Salas, as authorized Co-Special
Administrator on behalf of the Estate of Luigi Antonio Vernola (“Moving
Defendant”) 
 
RESPONDING
PARTY: Plaintiff 
 
The
Court has considered the moving, opposition and reply papers.
 
BACKGROUND
This
action arises out of a dispute over the assets of Decedent Luigi Antonio
Varnola (“Decedent”).  Plaintiff’s
complaint (the “Complaint”) alleges: (1) breach of contract.  In relevant part, the Complaint alleges: On
or around October 14, 2018, Decedent and Plaintiff signed a letter from
Plaintiff to Decedent (the “2018 Letter”) in which Decedent promised to
bequeath parcels of real property to Plaintiff. 
(See Complaint, Exhibit A.) 
The 2018 Letter includes a paragraph that states that certain properties
would be transferred to Plaintiff upon Decedent’s death.  (See id.)  Plaintiff filed a creditor’s claim asserting
rights to the properties referenced in the 2018 Agreement on December 16, 2021,
which Moving Defendant denied on January 10, 2022.  (See Complaint at 2, Exhibit A.) 
 
On
February 9, 2023, Moving Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment (the
“Motion”) on the grounds that there are no triable issues of material fact that
Plaintiff may not prevail on her breach of contract claim.  
 
EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
            Moving Defendant’s objections to the Declaration of
Gracie Smith (“Smith Decl.”) numbers 1-3 and 5-9 are OVERRULED.  Objection NUMBER 4 to the Smith Declaration
is SUSTAINED. 
 
Moving
Defendant’s objections to the Declaration of Christopher P. Brandlin (“Brandlin
Decl.”) numbers 1 and 2 are OVERRULED. 
Moving Defendant’s objections to the Brandlin Declaration numbers 3-7
are SUSTAINED. 
 
DISCUSSION
The function of a motion for summary judgment or
adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing party cannot
show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an order of
summary dismissal without the need for trial.  (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.)  California Code of Civil Procedure
(“CCP”) section 437c, subdivision (c) requires the trial judge to grant summary
judgment if all the evidence submitted, and all inferences reasonably deducible
from the evidence and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that
there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law. 
(Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp.
(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)
 
As to each claim as framed by the complaint, the
defendant moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial burden of proof
by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to establish a defense.  (CCP § 437c, subd. (p)(2); Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.)  Courts
liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary
judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that
party.  (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
 
Once the defendant has met that burden, the burden
shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more material
facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.  To establish a triable issue of material
fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial responsive
evidence.  (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166.) 
 
Relevant
Evidence
When he died, Decedent had been married to Joan
Vernola (“Joan”) for over 55 years.  (See
UMF 1, 11.)[1]  Decedent and Joan had never separated or
divorced before Decedent’s death.  (UMF
12.)  Smith never registered as
Decedent’s domestic partner.  (UMF
20.)  Decedent and Joan did not have a
prenuptial agreement.  (UMF 22.)  The assets that Plaintiff contends Decedent
promised her were all acquired with community property funds during Decedent’s
marriage to Joan.  (UMF 23.)  Joan was neither aware of nor consented to the
property transfers referred to in the 2018 Letter.  (UMF 24.) 
Plaintiff co-authored the 2018 Letter. 
(See UMF 17.)  
 
Plaintiff presents evidence that she was in a
relationship with Decedent and had been living with him since 2015.  (Smith Decl. ¶ 3.)  Plaintiff declares that Decedent told her that
he was legally separated from Joan.  (Id.)  Plaintiff declares that Decedent wished to
transfer her the properties referred to in the 2018 Letter because of the
business assistance she provided him during their relationship.  (See Smith Decl. ¶ 10.) 
 
Breach
of Contract
The elements of a claim for
breach of contract are: (1) the contract; (2) the plaintiff’s performance or
excuse for nonperformance; (3) the defendant’s breach; and (4) damage to
plaintiff therefrom.  (Wall Street
Network, Ltd. v. New York Times Co. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1171,
1178.)  
 
Where a marriage is
invalid due to some legal infirmity, an innocent party may be entitled to
relief under the putative spouse doctrine. 
(In re Marriage of Tejeda (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 973, 979.)  Under the equitable putative spouse doctrine,
a person's reasonable, good faith belief that his or her marriage is valid
entitles that person to the benefits of marriage, even if the marriage is not,
in fact, valid.  (Id. at
980.)  Improper transfer of community
property is not void ab initio, but merely voidable at the instance of the
aggrieved spouse.  (Marvin v. Marvin
(1976) 18 Cal.3d 660, 673.)
 
Under Probate Code section 21380, there is a conclusive
presumption that a provision of an instrument making a donative transfer to the
person who drafted the instrument.  (See
Probate Code § 21380, subds. (a)(1), (c).) 

 
Moving Defendant argues
that the 2018 Letter is not enforceable because Joan did not consent to the
transfer of community property and because any posthumous property transfers
are presumptively void under Probate Code section 21380.  Plaintiff contends that she is entitled to
the properties detailed in the 2018 Letter because she was Decedent’s putative
spouse.  
 
While Plaintiff is
generally correct that non-married domestic partners may enter into agreements
regarding the disposition of their property, Plaintiff provides no evidence to
raise a factual dispute that she believed she was in a marriage with Decedent,
that Plaintiff and Decedent were never registered domestic partners, or that
the properties referred to in the 2018 Letter were purchased with community
property in which she was a member of the community.  Absent this evidence, Plaintiff provides no
grounds for the 2018 Letter to be enforceable, even if there is a dispute over
the nature of Decedent’s personal relationship with Plaintiff.
 
 
 
Further, Plaintiff does
not dispute that she drafted the 2018 Letter—as a result, the Plaintiff does
not present any evidence to raise a factual dispute over the conclusive
presumption of fraud.  
 
Based on the foregoing,
the Court finds that there are no triable issues of material fact regarding the
invalidity of the 2018 Letter as a contract for the posthumous transfer of
Decedent’s property.  The Court therefore
GRANTS the Motion.  
 
            Moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
 
Parties

department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
