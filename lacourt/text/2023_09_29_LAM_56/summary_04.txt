And here is a summary of the English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendant, Joe Bartolome. The plaintiff, Steeve Choe, alleges negligence and breach of fiduciary duty against the defendant. The defendant claims that the complaint fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action.

The judge has reviewed the moving and opposition papers and has considered the legal standard for evaluating a demurrer. The judge has determined that the complaint fails to adequately allege the elements of a cause of action for both negligence and breach of fiduciary duty.

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the first cause of action, which is based on alleged breach of contract, and has given the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint. The judge has also sustained the demurrer to the second cause of action, which is based on alleged breach of fiduciary duty, and has given the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint.

The judge has ordered the moving party to give notice of this ruling and has instructed the parties to submit their intentions regarding the tentative ruling.
