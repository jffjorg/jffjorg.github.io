dba Pacoima Adult Day Care erroneously sued and served as GMA Management Group,
Inc. dba Pacoima Adult Day Care

RULING: The motion is granted as set forth below.  
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
On 6/7/21, Plaintiff Phyllis R. Ginolfi, by and through
her Conservator, Christin C. Solis (Plaintiff) filed this action against Right
Choice In-Home Care, Inc. (Right Choice) and HDL, Inc. dba Pacoima Adult Day
Care erroneously sued and served as GMA Management Group, Inc. dba Pacoima
Adult Day Care (HDL) for dependent adult/elder abuse and negligence.  On 3/15/23, Plaintiff filed a Doe Amendment
naming Defendant Keolis Transit America, Inc. as Doe 1 (Keolis).
 
Plaintiff alleges that she fell at HDL’s facility on
8/20/19 and suffered a broken leg as a result. 
In August 2019, Dustin Stothoff (Stothoff), was Plaintiff’s home
caregiver.  Stothoff received Plaintiff
on the day of the alleged incident after she was dropped off at home.  Plaintiff produced a written statement
drafted by Stothoff which HDL believes Plaintiff will rely on to support her
theory of how the incident occurred.
 
On 10/2/23, Stothoff was personally served with a
subpoena for personal appearance at a deposition and a notice of taking his
deposition on 10/27/23.  (D’Andrea Decl.
¶3, Ex.A, B).  Stothoff cashed the
witness fee check on 10/31/23 and then failed to appear for his
deposition.  (Id. ¶¶4-5, Ex.C).  Stothoff has failed to return any of the
phone calls inquiring about his failure to appear.  (Id. ¶6).  
 
On 12/8/23, HDL filed and served the instant motion on
counsel for Plaintiff, Right Choice and Keolis. 
On 12/13/23, the motion was personally served on Stothoff.  The motion seeks an order compelling
non-party witness Dustin Stothoff to appear for his deposition on 1/23/24.  Stothoff has not opposed or otherwise
responded to the motion.  
 
 
 
ANALYSIS
   
The Court notes that the notice
of motion indicates that the motion is made pursuant to CCP 2025.450 which
applies when a party deponent fails to appear for a properly noticed
deposition.  However, the memorandum of
points and authorities correctly cites and relies on CCP 1987.1 which applies
when a non-party witness fails to comply with a deposition subpoena.  
 
Pursuant to CCP 1987.1(a), the
Court may order Stothoff to comply with the depositions subpoena.  Additionally, Stothoff may be punished for
contempt for the disobedience of the deposition subpoena without the necessity
of a prior court order directing compliance. 
CCP 2020.240.  Stothoff is also
subject to the forfeiture of $500 and may be ordered to pay all damages sustained
by HDL by the failure to appear.  See
CCP 2020.240; CCP 1992.  
 
In the alternative to
compelling his appearance at deposition, the motion requests that the Court
hold Stothoff in contempt for his failure to appear at the deposition pursuant
to the subpoena or order him to pay HDL $500.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Dustin Stothoff is ordered to appear
for his deposition on 1/23/24.
