And here is a summary in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by HDL, Inc. (dba Pacoima Adult Day Care) to compel the deposition of non-party witness Dustin Stothoff. The motion was filed on December 8, 2023, and seeks an order compelling Stothoff to appear for his deposition on January 23, 2024. Stothoff failed to appear for his deposition on October 27, 2023, and has since failed to respond to the motion.

The court notes that Stothoff received a subpoena for his deposition and a notice of taking his deposition on October 2, 2023. He was personally served with the subpoena on October 27, 2023, but failed to appear for his deposition. The court finds that Stothoff has failed to comply with the deposition subpoena and may be punished for contempt for his disobedience.

The court orders Stothoff to appear for his deposition on January 23, 2024. In the alternative, the court may hold Stothoff in contempt for his failure to appear at the deposition or order him to pay $500.
