Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by JW Brands LLC, as to the 1st cause of action for fraud and the 3rd cause of action for quantum meruit. The motion is denied as to the remaining causes of action (breach of written contract, account stated, and open book account). The judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure section 438(i), which requires that a party who moves for judgment on the pleadings and is granted leave to amend, must file an amended pleading within a certain time period. Since the plaintiffs failed to file an amended complaint, the judge has granted judgment in favor of JW Brands LLC on the two causes of action that were previously granted.
