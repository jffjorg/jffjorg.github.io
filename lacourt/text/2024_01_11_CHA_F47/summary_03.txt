The judge has ruled that the demurrer filed by the defendant, Lief Organics, LLC, is placed off calendar.

However, before the hearing date, the plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint, which renders the demurrer moot. The judge notes that the parties had attempted to meet and confer regarding the issues with the complaint, but were unsuccessful.
