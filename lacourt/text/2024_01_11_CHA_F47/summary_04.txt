And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants. The demurrer is sustained and the motion to strike is granted. The plaintiff's claims of breach of contract, breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and fraud are dismissed due to the plaintiff's failure to adequately plead his claims. The plaintiff has failed to provide sufficient facts to establish his claims, and the court cannot determine the parties to the contract, its terms and/or whether the alleged conduct by defendants constitutes a breach of same. The court also finds that the fraud cause of action is not pled with the requisite factual specificity. The court grants the defendants' motion to strike certain allegations in the complaint and gives the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint.
