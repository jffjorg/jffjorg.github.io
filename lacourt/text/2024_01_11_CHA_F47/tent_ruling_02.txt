SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of an agreement between Defendant
024 Management Services, Inc. (024 Management), Defendant JW Brands LLC (JW
Brands) and Plaintiffs Chris Lacroix (Lacroix) and Martin Willerford
(Willerford) (collectively, Plaintiffs). 
(Complaint, Ex.A).  Plaintiffs
allege that in or about 2020, Plaintiffs and Defendants entered a written
agreement whereby Defendants hired Plaintiffs to operate a division of its
business, Plaintiffs would provide services, pricing and terms, and Defendants
would pay for said products.  (Complaint
¶6, p.3).  Plaintiffs further allege that
they provided a loan of startup capital to Defendants.  (Id. and Ex.A thereto).  Plaintiffs allege that Defendants breached
the agreement by preventing Plaintiffs from providing services and refusing to
return the startup loan funds. 
(Complaint ¶12, p.4).
 
On 1/10/22, Plaintiffs filed this action against 024
Management, JW Brands, Michael Wayman (Wayman), Tim McCandless (McCandless) and
Derek Markstein (Markstein) for: (1) Fraud, 
(2) Breach of Written Contract, (3) Quantum Meruit, (4)
Account Stated and (5) Open Book Account. 
On 10/4/22, JW Brands and Markstein filed separate answers to the
complaint.  On 10/10/22, default was
entered against 024 Management and on 10/11/22, default was entered against
McCandless and Wayman.  
 
After meet and confer efforts failed to resolve the
issues JWBrands and Markstein had with the complaint, on 5/18/23, Markstein and
JW Brands filed separate motions for judgment on the pleadings which both sought
orders granting judgment on the entirety of Plaintiffs’ complaint and the fraud
and quantum meruit causes of action. 
Plaintiffs opposed the motions and JWBrands and Markstein filed a reply
to the opposition.  
 
On 7/14/23, this Court granted Markstein’s motion for
judgment on the pleadings as to the entire complaint and granted JWBrands’
motion for judgment on the pleadings only as to the 1st cause of
action for Frand and 3rd cause of action for Quantum Meruit.  (See 7/14/23 Minute Order, p.4).  Plaintiffs were given 20 days leave to amend
which was extended by agreement of the parties. 
(Id.; Bowen Decl. ¶¶3-5; Opposition, p.1:27-p.2:9).  Plaintiffs failed to file an amended
complaint by the agreed upon deadline. 
(Bowen Decl. ¶5; Opposition, generally; eCourt, generally – no First
Amended Complaint has been filed).  
 
On 11/17/23, JWBrands filed and served the instant motion
seeking an order granting judgment in its favor.  On 11/20/23, Plaintiffs filed a request for
dismissal as to the entire complaint against Markstein.  On 12/6/23, Plaintiffs filed an opposition to
the instant motion.  No reply to the
opposition has been filed.    
 
ANALYSIS
 
CCP 438(i) provides, in relevant part:  
 
(1) Where a motion for judgment on
the pleadings is granted with leave to amend, the court shall not enter a
judgment in favor of a party until the following proceedings are had:
 
. .
.
 
(B) If no amended pleading is
filed, then the party shall move for entry of judgment in its favor.
 
In the opposition, Plaintiffs state that they do not
oppose the motion as to the fraud and quantum meruit causes of action.  (See Opposition, p.1:21-22,
p.3:10-21).  However, Plaintiffs do
oppose the motion as to any of the other causes of action.  (Id. p.1:22-24).
 
Since the Court previously only granted judgment on the
pleadings, with leave to amend, as to the 1st cause of action for
Fraud and 3rd cause of action for Quantum Meruit as to JWBrands,
JWBrands is only entitled to judgment in its favor on those claims after
Plaintiffs failed to amend their complaint. 
JWBrands has not provided any authority which would entitle it to have
judgment entered in its favor on the causes of action the Court did not grant
the prior motion for judgment on the pleading. 

 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted as to the 1st cause of
action for Fraud and 3rd cause of action for Quantum Meruit and is
denied as to the 2nd, 4th and 5th causes of
action.
