SUMMARY
OF ACTION
In
February 2022 Rade Raicevic was involved in an automobile collision with Menua
Simonyan.  On March 1, 2022, Raicevic
settled with Simonyan’s insurance company for $500, executing a full release of
all claims as part of that agreement.  It
is undisputed that Raicevic signed the agreement and received the settlement
funds.  In November 2023 Raicevic sued
Simonyan for damages allegedly caused by the same accident.  Simonyan answered, asserting, among others,
the settlement and release agreement as an affirmative defense.
 
In
October 2024, Simonyan brought this motion to enforce the settlement agreement
and order Raicevic to return the settlement funds pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 664.6.  Raicevic, who
is self-represented, opposes the motion on the ground that he agreed to settle
for $50,000, not for $500, and that the settlement was procured by deceit.
 
ANALYSIS
“If parties to pending litigation stipulate,
in a writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or
orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the
court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the
settlement.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 664.6,
subd. (a), italics added.)  Because the
settlement agreement at issue here was reached approximately 20 months before
this action was filed, the settlement was not reached as part of pending
litigation and defendant can not use it to enforce the agreement.  (Kirby v. Southern California Edison Co.
(2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 840, 843-845.) 
Simonyan’s motion is therefore improper.
 
 
ORDER
Defendant’s motion to enter judgment under Code of
Civil Procedure section 664.6 is denied without prejudice to seeking relief by
any other procedurally appropriate means.
 
Defendant Menua Simonyan to give notice.
