And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted the Defendant's motion to compel responses to Special Interrogatories, Set Two. The Plaintiff, Juan Ayala, has failed to serve responses to the interrogatories despite multiple deadline extensions and meet and confer attempts. The Court finds that the Plaintiff has not shown a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve the issues before filing the motion. The Court orders the Plaintiff to serve code-compliant, objection-free responses to the special interrogatories within 20 days of the date of this order. Additionally, the Court awards the Defendant $500.00 in sanctions against the Plaintiff and their counsel.
