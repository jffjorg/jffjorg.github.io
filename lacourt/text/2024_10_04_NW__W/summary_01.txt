And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for relief from the waiver of a jury trial. The plaintiff, Otoniel Martinez, had waived his right to a jury trial by failing to timely pay the jury fee. However, the plaintiff argues that he believed the jury fee was paid when the complaint was filed in March 2020, and it was only later that he discovered the error. The court finds that the plaintiff did waive his right to a jury trial, but grants the motion for relief because the plaintiff has demonstrated preparedness for a jury trial and there is no prejudice to the court or the defendants. The court also notes that it is well-established that when doubt exists as to relief, the court must resolve that doubt in favor of the party seeking jury trial.
