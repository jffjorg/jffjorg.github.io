for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a

protection for work product. . . .  The
party making the demand may move for an order compelling response to the
demand.”  (CCP § 2031.300(a)–(b).)
 
A. Defendant Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.’s
Motions
 
Defendant Wells Fargo moves compel
responses to FIs, SIs and RPDs and to deem RFAs admitted against Plaintiff. Defendant
served the subject discovery on May 24, 2024. Responses were due on June 25,
2024. In opposition, Plaintiff represents that Plaintiff recently obtained
counsel and has been working to respond to Defendant’s discovery requests. In
reply, Defendant asserts that Plaintiff served some sort of responses, but they
do not appear to be the correct responses to Defendant’s discovery as they
contain the wrong number responses relative to the number of requests. 
 
The Court will continue the motions to
allow Plaintiff to serve responses. The motions are CONTINUED to November 25,
2024 at 9:00 am. Plaintiff to serve responses and file a declaration stating
responses have been served no later than November 20, 2024.
 
B. Donnelly Defendants’ Motions
 
Defendants Edward J.
Donnelly III, Chantal L Donnelly and Donnelly Family Trust moves compel responses to FIs, SIs
and RPDs and to deem RFAs admitted against Plaintiff. Defendant served the
subject discovery on May 17, 2024. After granting Plaintiff’s former counsel an
extension, responses were due on July 19, 2024. In opposition, Plaintiff
represents that Plaintiff recently obtained counsel and has been working to
respond to Defendant’s discovery requests. In reply, Defendants assert the
Court already continued these motions to allow Plaintiff to retain counsel and
serve responses and requests that the Court decline to provide additional time.

 
The Court will continue the motions to
allow Plaintiff to serve responses. The motions are CONTINUED to November 25,
2024 at 9:00 am. Plaintiff to serve responses and file a declaration stating
responses have been served no later than November 20, 2024.
