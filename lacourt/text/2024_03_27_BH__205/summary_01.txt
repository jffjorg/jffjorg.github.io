And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer and motion to strike filed by Defendant Ernesto Morales. The case arises from a failed bid by Plaintiff Aaron Celious' company Maroon Society Inc. for two government projects. Morales argues that the Plaintiff lacks standing to sue on his claim under the California Unfair Competition Law (UCL) and that the Plaintiff's tortious interference claims fail to allege that Morales was aware of an economic relationship between Plaintiff and Maroon or between Plaintiff and the City.

The judge has struck the Plaintiff's claims against Morales for negligent interference with prospective advantage, UCL and punitive damages, and the requests for relief associated with the UCL claim. However, the judge has overruled Morales' demurrer to the intentional interference claim, finding that the Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged each of the elements of the claim.

The judge has denied Morales' motion to strike the Plaintiff's request for legal costs. The case will proceed with the intentional interference claim remaining against Morales.
