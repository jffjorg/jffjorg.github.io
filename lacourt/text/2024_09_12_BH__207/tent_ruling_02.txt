[1] “The entry of a default terminates a defendant's
rights to take any further affirmative steps in the litigation until either its
default is set aside or a default judgment is entered.”  (Devlin v. Kearny Mesa AMC/Jeep/Renault,
Inc. (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 381, 385.) 
Further, the entry of default “[c]uts off the defendant's right to file
pleadings and motions (other than a motion to set aside default under § 473),
and it also cuts off the defendant's right to notices and the service of
pleadings or papers.”  (Bailey v.
Citibank, N.A. (2021) 66 Cal.App.5th 335, 347.)  


[2] “The concept of justiciability involves the
intertwined criteria of ripeness and standing. Standing derives from the
principle that every action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in
interest.  A party lacks standing if it
does not have an actual and substantial interest in, or would not be benefited
or harmed by, the ultimate outcome of an action.  Standing is a function not just of a party's
stake in a case, but the degree of vigor or intensity with which the presents
its arguments. Ripeness refers to the requirements of a current controversy.
According to the Supreme Court, an action not founded upon an actual
controversy between the parties to it, and brought for the purpose of securing
a determination of a point of law will not be entertained. A controversy
becomes ripe once it reaches, but has not passed, the point that the facts have
sufficiently congealed to permit an intelligent and useful decision to be
made.”  (City of Santa Monica v.
Stewart (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 43, 59 [cleaned up].)

probable validity of their claims, the Court need not address the remaining
elements.
