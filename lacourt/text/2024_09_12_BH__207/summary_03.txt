And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the unopposed motion to consolidate the two cases, Estrada v. Baly and Khan v. Baly, which were filed separately but arise from the same three-way automobile collision. The cases were related on July 2, 2024, and are pending in Department 207. The judge finds that consolidation is warranted because the cases involve the same common questions of law and fact, and consolidation will avoid unnecessary costs and delay. The judge orders that the cases are consolidated for all purposes, with Estrada v. Baly designated as the lead case.
