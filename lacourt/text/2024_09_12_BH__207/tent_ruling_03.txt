MOTION
 
On January 19, 2024, Plaintiff Robert Estrada (“Estrada”) filed a
complaint for damages (negligence) in 24SMCV00280 against Defendants Attila
Peter Baly and Optimal Technology, LLC (“Defendants”).   
 
On the same date, Plaintiff Wajeeh Khan (“Khan”), represented by the
same counsel as Estrada, filed a complaint for damages (negligence) in
24SMCV00281 against the same Defendants. 

 
Both actions allegedly arise from the same three-way automobile
collision, the Defendants in both cases are identical, and the plaintiffs are
represented by the same counsel.  The
cases were related on July 2, 2024 and are pending in Department 207.  
 
Defendants now move to consolidate the two actions for all
purposes.  The motion is unopposed.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Procedural Requirements
 
            Per Local Rules, rule 3.3(g), “Cases
may not be consolidated unless they are in the same department.  A motion to consolidate two or more cases may
be noticed and heard after the cases, initially filed in different departments,
have been related into a single department, or if the cases were already
assigned to that department.”  (Super.
Ct. L.A. County, Local Rules, rule 3.3(g)(1).) 
Once the Court relates the cases, the Court may consolidate the actions
and order a joint trial on matters that “involve[e] a common question of law or
fact.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1048, subd.
(a).)
 
            Both cases were related on July 2,
2024, and are currently pending before the same department.  Therefore,
there are no procedural hurdles to consolidation.
 
            Substantive
Requirements
 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 1048, subdivision (a) provides:
 
When actions involving a
common question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may order a
joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the actions; it
may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such orders concerning
proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.
            
            Both
cases involve the same three-way vehicle collision and the same causes of
action alleged against the same two defendants. 
Further, both plaintiffs are represented by the same counsel.  Thus, there will inevitably be common
questions of law and fact.  
 
            As
such, the Court finds that consolidation is warranted.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court grants Defendants’ unopposed motion to
consolidate Estrada v. Baly (Super. Ct. L.A. County, 2024, No.
24SMCV00280) with Khan v. Baly (Super. Ct. L.A. County, 2024, No.
24SMCV00281).    
 
The Court further orders that the cases are consolidated for all
purposes and Estrada v. Baly (Super. Ct. L.A. County, 2024, No.
24SMCV00280) is designated as the lead case per California Rules of Court, rule
3.350(b).  The Court further orders that
all proceedings and hearing dates in Khan v. Baly (Super. Ct. L.A.
County, 2024, No. 24SMCV00281) are vacated.
 
            Defendants shall provide notice of
the Court’s ruling and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
