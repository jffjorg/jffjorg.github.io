And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court's tentative ruling addresses the concept of justiciability, which involves the intertwined criteria of ripeness and standing. The court notes that the entry of a default terminates a defendant's rights to take further affirmative steps in the litigation, including the right to file pleadings and motions, except for a motion to set aside default. The court also finds that the plaintiffs failed to establish the probable validity of their claims, and therefore need not address the remaining elements. The ruling suggests that the court will not entertain an action that is not founded on an actual controversy between the parties and brought for the purpose of securing a determination of a point of law.
