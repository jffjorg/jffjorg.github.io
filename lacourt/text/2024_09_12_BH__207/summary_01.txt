And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion for a writ of attachment and has determined that the motion should be denied without prejudice. The court finds that the plaintiffs have not provided sufficient evidence to establish the probable validity of their breach of contract claim. Specifically, the court finds that the statute of frauds renders the oral contracts for the purchase of fractional trust deeds unenforceable. The court also finds that the defendants lack standing to oppose the application. As a result, the court denies the motion for a writ of attachment without prejudice.
