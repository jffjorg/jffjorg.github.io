BACKGROUND
This is a medical malpractice action. Plaintiff Deborah
Amelon filed the complaint against defendants Dr. Solymanijam, M.D. and
Consultants for Lung Diseases Medical Group, Inc., erroneously sued and served
as Consultants for Lung Disease Medical Group, Inc. on May 5, 2023. Plaintiff
alleges that in January and February 2015, defendant treated plaintiff for
chest soreness and related complaints, including ordering and interpreting a CT
angiogram of plaintiff’s chest, a Nuclear Medicine Ventilation and Perfusion
Scan. Plaintiff alleges defendant erroneously diagnosed plaintiff with
pulmonary emboli when plaintiff did not have pulmonary emboli. As a result,
plaintiff was treated for pulmonary emboli for almost five months. Plaintiff
alleges she suffered severe and permanent injury as well as emotional and
mental distress as a result of the misdiagnosis.
Defendant Robin Solymanijam, M.D. (defendant) filed the
instant motions on July 18, 2024. No opposition has been received.
LEGAL STANDARD
A plaintiff may propound interrogatories without leave of
court at any time 10 days after the service of the summons on, or appearance
by, the party to whom the demand is directed, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd.
(b).)
The party whom the request is propounded upon is required
to respond within 30 days after service of a demand, but the parties are
allowed to informally agree to an extension and confirm any such agreement in
writing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.270,
subd. (a) - (b).)
Where there has been no timely response to interrogatories,
the demanding party may seek an order compelling a response. (Code Civ. Proc. §
2030.290, subd. (b).) If a party fails to timely respond to interrogatories,
the party to whom the request is directed waives any right to exercise the
option to produce writings under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.230, and
waives any objection, including one based on privilege or on the protection for
work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)
DISCUSSION
Defendant served Judicial Council Form Interrogatories, Set
One and Special Interrogatories, Set One on April 12, 2024, via email.
(Steinberg Decl., ¶¶ 5, 6; Exhs. A, B.) Plaintiff’s responses were due May 14,
2024. Defenant’s counsel followed up with plaintiff’s counsel regarding the
responses to no avail. (Steinberg Decl., ¶¶ 8, 9; Exhs. D, E.) Plaintiff has
not provided verified responses. As defendant served
discovery properly and plaintiff has failed to provide verified responses, the
court orders plaintiff to provide verified responses to form and special
interrogatories.
Based on the foregoing, the court GRANTS defendant’s
motions to compel responses to form and special interrogatories. The court
orders plaintiff to serve verified responses by December 23, 2004.
