And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's application for default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff, Alfredo Talavera Huirache, is seeking default judgment against the defendants, U.S. Fleet Disposal Inc., Skyfleet Used Auto & Truck Sales, and Rajesh Sharma, for breach of contract, fraud, conversion, and declaratory relief. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants failed to make promised repairs to a 2012 Ford F-750 truck that he purchased from Skyfleet in October 2020. The plaintiff claims that the defendants promised to repair the truck's front and rear brakes, ABS sensor, and key switch, but failed to do so. The plaintiff filed a complaint on March 14, 2023, and the defendants were served on March 24, 2023. The plaintiff submitted an application for default judgment on September 21, 2023. The judge denied the application because the plaintiff failed to include the requested amount of $111,685 on the mandatory CIV-100 form and because the amount requested exceeds the amount requested in the complaint. The judge also noted that the plaintiff failed to comply with the legal standard for seeking a default judgment.
