And here is the English text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the City of Baldwin Park's motion for an automatic stay of proceedings. The motion is continued to be heard concurrently with the Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on January 17, 2024. The City argues that the issue of the November 2016 assessment's compliance with ICRMA's bylaws is similar to the issue in a pending appeal in City of Redondo Beach v. Independent Cities Risk Management Authority, and therefore, the stay is necessary. However, the Judge finds that the doctrine of waiver and estoppel are applicable, and the City's request for a stay to be premature. The Judge will continue the City's motion to be heard with ICRMA's motion for summary judgment, as the issue of waiver requires a review of the material facts and is addressed by ICRMA's separate motion for summary judgment.
