And here is the English text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the City of Baldwin Park's motion for an automatic stay of proceedings. The motion is continued to be heard concurrently with the Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on January 17, 2024. The City argues that the issue of the November 2016 assessment's compliance with ICRMA's bylaws is similar to the issue in a pending appeal in City of Redondo Beach v. Independent Cities Risk Management Authority, and therefore, the stay is necessary. However, the Judge finds that the doctrine of waiver and estoppel are applicable, and the City's request for a stay to be premature. The Judge will continue the City's motion to be heard with ICRMA's motion for summary judgment, as the issue of waiver requires a review of the material facts and is addressed by ICRMA's separate motion for summary judgment.

## English Summary

This is a legal dispute between the Independent Cities Risk Management Authority (ICRMA) and the City of Baldwin Park. ICRMA, a self-insurance pool for cities, is suing the City of Baldwin Park for unpaid exit fees and assessments. The City of Baldwin Park has requested a delay in the proceedings while a similar case involving ICRMA and the City of Redondo Beach is being appealed. The judge has decided to postpone the City's request for a stay of proceedings until after ICRMA's motion for summary judgment is heard. The judge believes that the issue of whether the City of Baldwin Park waived any potential challenges to the assessments is crucial to the case and needs to be addressed in the context of the summary judgment motion.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the City of Baldwin Park's motion for an automatic stay of proceedings and has decided to continue the motion to be heard concurrently with the Independent Cities Risk Management Authority's motion for summary judgment on January 17, 2024. The City moved for a stay pending the resolution of an appeal in a separate but similar action, City of Redondo Beach v. Independent Cities Risk Management Authority. The Court found that the doctrine of waiver and estoppel may be applicable in this case, and therefore, the City's request for a stay is premature. The Court will continue to hear the City's motion to be heard concurrently with ICRMA's motion for summary judgment.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Independent Cities Risk Management Authority (ICRMA) vs. City of Baldwin Park. The City has filed a motion for an automatic stay of proceedings due to an appeal pending in a separate but similar action. However, the Judge has decided to continue the motion to be heard concurrently with ICRMA's motion for summary judgment on January 17, 2024. The Judge found that the issue of waiver requires a review of the material facts and is addressed by ICRMA's separate motion for summary judgment, making the City's request for a stay premature. The case involves a breach of contract action arising from a municipal insurance agreement, and the Judge has determined that the doctrine of waiver and estoppel are applicable. The City had argued that the November 2016 assessment was not conducted in accordance with ICRMA's bylaws, but the Judge found that this argument fails as the assessment is not a contract and instead constitutes ICRMA's performance of its obligations pursuant to the joint powers agreement. The Judge has also found that the City may still be liable if ICRMA can establish that the City waived any defects with the assessment.

- "Even if the November 2016 assessment was not conducted in accordance with ICRMA’s bylaws, the City may still be liable if ICRMA can establish the City waived any defects with the assessment."

The tentative ruling by the Judge states that the Defendant City of Baldwin Park's Motion for an Automatic Stay of Proceedings is CONTINUED to be heard concurrently with the Plaintiff Independent Cities Risk Management Authority's Motion for Summary Judgment on January 17, 2024. This is a breach of contract action arising from a municipal insurance agreement, where the Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant refused to pay invoiced amounts after terminating its membership with ICRMA. The Defendant argues that it cannot be held liable for breach of contract because the November 2016 assessment was not conducted in accordance with ICRMA’s bylaws. However, the Court finds that even if the November 2016 assessment was not conducted in accordance with ICRMA’s bylaws, the City may still be liable if ICRMA can establish the City waived any defects with the assessment. The issue of waiver requires a review of the material facts and is addressed by ICRMA’s separate motion for summary judgment, therefore, the Court finds the City’s request for a stay to be premature.
