 Case Number:  23PSCV00756    Hearing Date:   September 28, 2023    Dept:  G Plaintiff Alfredo Talavera Huirache’s Application for
Default Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Alfredo Talavera Huirache’s Application for
Default Judgment is DENIED without
prejudice.
BACKGROUND
This
is an action for contractual fraud. In October 2020, Defendant U.S. Fleet
Disposal Inc. (U.S. Fleet) transferred ownership of a 2012 Ford F-750 truck to Defendant
Skyfleet Used Auto & Truck Sales (Skyfleet). In the same month, Plaintiff Alfredo
Talavera Huirache purchased the truck from Skyfleet for $41,000 with a $30,000
down payment. During the sale of the truck, Talavera Huirache alleges the
salesperson for U.S. Fleet and Skyfleet promised that the front and rear brakes
of the truck would be repaired along with the truck’s ABS sensor and key switch.
From
November 2021 to April 2022, Talavera Huirache alleges U.S. Fleet and Skyfleet
failed to make the promised repairs. In January 2023, Talavera Huirache spoke with
Defendant Rajesh Sharma who told Talavera Huirache to leave the truck with them
at U.S. Fleet’s City of Industry office and personally promised to ensure the
brakes were repaired. Talavera Huirache then alleges that Sharma failed to
return phone calls and that all defendants failed to make the promised repairs
or return Talavera Huirache’s truck.
On March
14, 2023, Talavera Huirache filed a complaint against U.S. Fleet, Skyfleet,
Sharma, and Does 1-50, alleging the following causes of action: (1) breach of
contract, (2) fraud, (3) conversion, and (4) declaratory relief. On March 24, Talavera
Huirache’s process server personally served U.S. Fleet, Skyfleet, and Sharma in
the City of Industry.
On May
10, 2023, default was entered against U.S. Fleet, Skyfleet, and Sharma. On September
21, Talavera Huirche submitted the present application for default judgment.
A OSC
Re: Default Judgment is set for September 28, 2023.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
Talavera
Huirache seeks default judgment against U.S. Fleet, Skyfleet, and Sharma. While
Talavera Huirache’s declaration and proposed judgment appear to request
$111,685, Talavera Huirache failed to include this amount or any amount on the
mandatory CIV-100 form. (See Holloway v. Quetel (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th
1425, 1432 [“A party seeking a default judgment on declarations must use
mandatory form CIV–100.”].) Additionally, Talavera Huirache cannot recover the
amount requested as it is more than the $100,000 requested in the Complaint. (See
Greenup v. Rodman (1986) 42 Cal.3d 822, 826 [holding a party may not obtain
damages in a default judgment that exceed the amount requested in the complaint].)
Accordingly,
the court DENIES Talavera Huirache’s application for default judgment.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Talavera
Huirache’s application for default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
