Default Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Mediterranean Shipping Co.’s Application for
Default Judgment is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
This
is a breach of contract action. In March 2015, Plaintiff Mediterranean Shipping
Co. (Mediterranean) and Defendant JB Power Inc. (JB Power) entered into a
Uniform Intermodal Interchange and Facilities Access Agreement. Subsequently, Mediterranean
alleges JB Power breached the agreement and damages Mediterranean in the sum of
$98,345.
On April
20, 2023, Mediterranean filed a complaint against JB Power and Does 1-10 for a
single count of breach of contract. On May 6, Mediterranean’s process server
personally served JB Power in Baldwin Park.
On August
7, 2023, default was entered against JB Power and Mediterranean submitted the
present application for default judgment.
A case
management conference is set for September 28, 2023.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
Mediterranean
seeks default judgment against JB Power in the total amount of $106,803.45,
including $98,345 in damages, $6,714.16 in interest, $1,200 in attorney fees,
and $544.29 in costs. Because the court finds Mediterranean has submitted
sufficient evidence, the court GRANTS their application for default
judgment.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Mediterranean’s
application for default judgment is GRANTED.
