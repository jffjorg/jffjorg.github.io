Here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting the Loos' motion to reopen discovery for the limited purpose of taking the depositions of the person(s) most knowledgeable for Defendants First American Title Company and LC Equity Group Inc. The Loos' prior counsel was unable to depose these defendants due to various reasons, including shoulder injuries and health problems. The court finds that the purposes of discovery, including to assist the parties and the trier of fact in ascertaining the truth, to encourage settlement, to expedite and facilitate preparation and trial, to prevent delay, and to safeguard against surprise, weigh in favor of allowing the Loos to depose these defendants. The court also finds that the reopening of discovery will not delay the Defendants' ability to prepare for trial, as the trial date was previously set for January 2024.

**English Summary:**

This tentative ruling deals with a motion by the plaintiffs, represented by the Loo family, to reopen discovery in a legal case involving quiet title and other claims. The case involves allegations of fraud and forgery related to loan applications.

The court finds that the plaintiffs have good cause to reopen discovery to depose two specific companies, First American Title and LC Equity Group, despite the fact that the trial date is approaching. The court acknowledges that the plaintiffs' previous counsel faced health issues that delayed the depositions but ultimately finds that the need to clarify the roles of these companies in the alleged fraudulent activities outweighs the potential for delay.

The ruling grants the plaintiffs' motion to reopen discovery for a limited purpose and sets conditions to minimize any further disruption to the trial schedule.

Summary:
The judge grants the plaintiffs' motion to reopen discovery for a limited purpose, specifically to take depositions of the defendants most knowledgeable about the alleged fraudulent activities. The plaintiffs' prior counsel was unable to take the depositions earlier due to health issues, and the defendants argue that the plaintiffs were not diligent in seeking the depositions. However, the judge finds that the purposes of discovery are still relevant in this case, and that reopening discovery will not delay the trial or prejudice the defendants. The judge orders the plaintiffs to be allowed to take the depositions and sets a deadline for the defendants to serve additional discovery requests.
