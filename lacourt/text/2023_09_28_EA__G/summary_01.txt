Here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting the Loos' motion to reopen discovery for the limited purpose of taking the depositions of the person(s) most knowledgeable for Defendants First American Title Company and LC Equity Group Inc. The Loos' prior counsel was unable to depose these defendants due to various reasons, including shoulder injuries and health problems. The court finds that the purposes of discovery, including to assist the parties and the trier of fact in ascertaining the truth, to encourage settlement, to expedite and facilitate preparation and trial, to prevent delay, and to safeguard against surprise, weigh in favor of allowing the Loos to depose these defendants. The court also finds that the reopening of discovery will not delay the Defendants' ability to prepare for trial, as the trial date was previously set for January 2024.
