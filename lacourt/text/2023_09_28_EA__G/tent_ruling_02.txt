 Case Number:  21PSCV00526    Hearing Date:   September 28, 2023    Dept:  G Defendant City of Baldwin Park’s Motion for an  Automatic Stay of Proceedings Respondent: Plaintiff  Independent Cities Risk Management Authority TENTATIVE RULING Defendant City of Baldwin Park’s Motion for an  Automatic Stay of Proceedings is CONTINUED to be heard concurrently with  Plaintiff Independent Cities Risk Management Authority’s Motion for Summary  Judgment on January 17, 2024. BACKGROUND This  is a breach of contract action arising from a municipal insurance agreement.  Plaintiff Independent Cities Risk Management Authority (ICRMA) is a joint  powers authority formed for purposes of self-insurance pooling among its  members. ICRMA required members to pay for deficiencies in funding for certain  liability program years and gave members the option of paying the assessment  over a ten-year period. At the time of this assessment, Defendant City of  Baldwin Park (the City) was a member of the ICRMA. The City elected to make  installment payments and tendered the first two payments in 2018 and 2019. On  July 1, 2019, the City terminated its membership with ICRMA. Pursuant to ICRMA’s  bylaws, ICRMA then invoiced the City for $114,935 in exit fees due August 16,  2019; $57,468 in exit fees due August 12, 2020; and $131,234.84 in assessment  payments due August 12, 2020. ICRMA alleges the City refused to pay the  invoiced amounts. On  June 24, 2021, ICRMA filed a complaint against the City and Does 1-50, alleging  (1) breach of contract and (2) declaratory relief. On June  28, 2023, the City filed an ex parte application for an order shortening the time to hear  a motion for an automatic stay of proceedings. On June 29, the court granted the  City’s motion and set a hearing for the motion to stay proceedings on August  16. On August 16, the court continued the hearing in order for parties to  submit additional briefing. A  hearing on the motion is set for September 28, 2023. A hearing on a motion for  summary judgment is set for January 17, 2024, with a mandatory settlement  conference on February 8 and a post-mediation status conference/trial setting  conference on February 26. ANALYSIS The  City moves for an automatic stay of the present action because of an appeal  pending in a separate but similar action. For the following reasons, the court CONTINUES the City’s motion. Legal Standard “Trial  courts generally have the inherent power to stay proceedings in the interests  of justice and to promote judicial efficiency.” (Freiberg v. City of  Mission Viejo (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1484, 1489.) They also have inherent  powers to manage and fashion procedures to control litigation and ensure the  orderly administration of justice.  (Cottle v. Superior Court (1992) 3  Cal.App.4th 1367, 1376-79; see also Code Civ. Proc., § 128, subd. (a)(3)  and (a)(5).) Discussion Here,  the City moves for a stay pending the resolution of an appeal in City of  Redondo Beach v. Independent Cities Risk Management Authority, Case No. BC674909  (Redondo Beach case). The City argues that case involves the same issues  as this action, including whether ICRMA had the authority to issue the November  2016 assessment to its members and (2) whether the November 2016 assessment was  calculated in accordance with ICRMA’s governance documents. In opposition, ICRMA  argues the City has waived any challenge to the November 2016 assessment by  voting for the assessment and by agreeing to pay the assessment. In response,  the City argues the doctrine of waiver is not applicable because ICRMA’s actions  were voided by the November 2016 assessment’s alleged noncompliance with  ICRMA’s governing documents. Both  parties agree that the binding agreement in this case is the Joint Exercise of  Powers Agreement for Insurance and Risk Management Purposes. (City Suppl.  Brief, p. 8:3-5; ICRMA Supp. Brief, p. 3:12-26.) The agreement creates the  ICRMA for the purposes of developing and designing risk management programs for  its membership and vests ICRMA with the authority to establish bylaws for its  risk management programs. (City Suppl. Brief, Ex. 3., art. 2, 9.) In this case,  the City argues it cannot be held liable for breach of contract because the  November 2016 assessment was not conducted in accordance with ICRMA’s bylaws. In  other words, the City argues ICRMA’s alleged failure to satisfy the conditions  of its governing documents excuses the City’s nonperformance. (See Mainieri  v. Magnuson (1954) 126 Cal.App.2d 426, 429 [failure to perform condition  precedent can excuse performance dependent on that condition].) “[A]  contract entered into by a governmental entity without the requisite  constitutional or statutory authority is void and unenforceable.” (Air  Quality Products, Inc. v. State of California (1979) 96 Cal.App.3d 340, 349.)  While the City relies on this rule in its argument, it does not argue the ICRMA  lacked authority to issue assessments that bind its members. (City Suppl.  Brief, p. 6:26-7:28.) Instead, it uses this rule to argue the November 2016  assessment itself is void because it did not comply with ICRMA’s bylaws. (City  Suppl. Brief, p. 7:18-28.) But this argument fails as the November 2016  assessment is not a contract and instead constitutes ICRMA’s performance of its  obligations pursuant to the joint powers agreement. This is an important  distinction as issues involving the performance of contractual obligations can  be waived in contrast with a contract that is void. (Compare Spellman v.  Dixon (1967) 256 Cal.App.2d 1, 4 [“[A] contracting party may waive  provisions placed in a contract solely for his benefit.”], with Tufeld  Corporation v. Beverly Hills Gateway, L.P. (2022) 86 Cal.App.5th 12, 27  [“[I]f a contract is void and not merely voidable, the equitable defenses of  estoppel, laches, and waiver do not apply.”].) Because  this case involves ICRMA’s contractual obligations pursuant to the joint powers  agreement as opposed to the validity of the joint powers agreement itself, the court  finds the doctrine of waiver and estoppel are applicable. Thus, even if the  November 2016 assessment was not conducted in accordance with ICRMA’s bylaws, the  City may still be liable if ICRMA can establish the City waived any defects  with the assessment. Because the issue of waiver requires a review of the  material facts and is addressed by ICRMA’s separate motion for summary  judgment, the court finds the City’s request for a stay to be premature. Accordingly,  the court will CONTINUE the City’s motion to be heard concurrently with  ICRMA’s motion for summary judgment. CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, the  City’s motion is CONTINUED to be heard concurrently with ICRMA’s motion  for summary judgment on January 17, 2024.
