And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc.'s Motion for Summary Judgment in this case. The plaintiff, Angela Reyes, brought an action against Kaiser and others alleging medical negligence and managed care negligence. However, Kaiser has established that it is a health care service plan under the Knox-Keene Act, which means it did not owe the plaintiff a duty of care for medical treatment and cannot be held vicariously liable for the alleged negligence of the other defendants. As the plaintiff did not file an opposition, the court has determined that there are no triable issues of material fact and has granted Kaiser's motion for summary judgment.
