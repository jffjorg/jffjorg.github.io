JOSE GUADALUPE SOTO-
RODRIGUEZ, et al. 
 
  
        
  vs.
 
AKG TRADING (USA) INC., et al. 
  


 Case
  No.:  23STCV08440  
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  November 12, 2024




 
On 4/17/2023,
Plaintiffs Jose Guadalupe-Soto Rodriguez and Sara Sanchez (collectively,
Plaintiffs) filed suit against 39 Defendants, alleging: (1) negligence; (2)
strict liability—warning defect; (3) strict liability—design defect; (4)
fraudulent concealment; (5) breach of implied warranties; and (6) loss of
consortium.  
 
            Now,
Defendant Mohawk Industries, Inc. (Defendant) moves to strike portions
of the SAC. 
 
Discussion 
 
            Defendant
argues that Plaintiffs have violated this Court ‘s instruction for the second
time by including allegations related to “One Quartz” and “One Quartz Surfaces”
against Defendant in their second amended complaint without seeking leave of
court.
 
            On
January 24, 2024, this Court explicitly directed Plaintiffs’ counsel Mr.
Metzger that Plaintiffs would need to seek leave of court to amend their
complaint if they would be identifying any additional products against
Defendant.
 
            Despite
this instruction, Plaintiffs added an additional product, “One Quartz,” against
Defendant in their first amended complaint without seeking leave of court. This
led Defendant to file yet another Motion to Strike, requesting the Court strike
the additional product identified, which the Court granted.
 
            Now,
Plaintiffs have nevertheless violated the Court’s instruction for the second
time and identified “One Quartz” and “One Quartz Surfaces” against Defendant in
their second amended complaint without seeking leave of court. 
 
California
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324(d) clearly states that “An amendment to a pleading
must not be made by alterations on the face of a pleading except by permission
of the court.” Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint was filed as a result of
Defendant Arriaga USA, Inc.’s demurrer, which was sustained by the Court on
July 26, 2024, giving Plaintiffs 15 days leave to amend. (Kavarian Decl. ¶ 10).
The Court’s order did not provide permission for Plaintiffs to amend the
complaint as it relates to Defendant, but only Defendant Arriaga USA, Inc.
Paragraphs 549-551 were never included in Plaintiffs original or first amended
complaint.
 
Defendant did
not request monetary sanctions in connection with its motion. For this reason,
the Court declines to sanction Plaintiff’s counsel at this time. However,
should Plaintiff violate this Court’s clear directive moving forward, it may
impose sanctions. 
 
Defendant’s
motion to strike is granted. 
 
 
It is so ordered.
