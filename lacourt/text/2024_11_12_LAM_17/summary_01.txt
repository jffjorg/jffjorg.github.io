The Plaintiffs, Jose Guadalupe Soto-Rodriguez and Sara Sanchez, filed a second amended complaint that included additional products without seeking leave of court, in violation of the judge's previous instruction. The judge granted the motion to strike, citing California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324(d), which requires permission to make amendments to a pleading. The judge also declined to impose monetary sanctions on the Plaintiffs' counsel at this time, but warned that future violations of the court's instructions may result in sanctions.
