Construction Corporation v. JM Creative Investments LLC, et al.,

Case
No. 23PSCV01611


ORDER
ON DEFAULT JUDGMENT APPLICATION
Plaintiff Granvista Construction
Corporation’s Application for Default Judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
 
Background
Plaintiff
Granvista
Construction Corporation (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows:
On May 16, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a written agreement
with JM Creative Investments LLC (“JM Creative”), Alan Robertson (“Robertson”),
Peninsula Retail Partners V LLC (“Peninsula”), Brett Del Valle (“Del Valle”)
and NES Investment LLC (“NES”), wherein Plaintiff agreed to perform various
tenant improvement work at the property located at 2200 S. Azusa Avenue in West
Covina (“property”) in exchange for $346,399.00. Additional change orders were
issued with the work Plaintiff performed. Plaintiff is still owed $25,919.18.
On
June 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint, asserting causes of
action against JM Creative, Roberston, Peninsula, Del Valle, NES, Ploutos Inc.
(“Ploutos”), and Does 1-20 for:
1.       Breach
of Contract;
2.       Common
Counts;
3.       Unjust
Enrichment; and 
4.       Quantum
Meruit.
On
August 22, 2023, the Clerk entered default against NES. On October 31, 2023,
Plaintiff dismissed “all Defendants other than NES INVESTMENTS LLC,” without
prejudice.

Pending
before the Court is Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment.


Discussion
Plaintiff’s
Application for Default Judgment is denied without prejudice. The
following defects are noted:
Alvaro
Garcia (“Garcia”) attests that he is limiting interest “to begin on February 1,
2023 when all of the extra work was completed and billed for.” (Garcia
Decl., ¶ 9)C) [Emphasis added].) Plaintiff subsequently attests that he has
attached all billing statements sent to NES as Exhibit “F” and attests that
“Plaintiff does not have any billing statement other than what is attached.” (Id.,
¶¶ 11 and 12.) Plaintiff has not provided the Court with a copy of the February
1, 2023 billing statement as part of Exhibit F. Plaintiff is directed to
provide that billing statement. Plaintiff is also directed to provide the Court
with a statement of account, to the extent that one exists.
Accordingly, the Court denies Plaintiff’s application without prejudice
and directs Plaintiff to submit a new default judgment application that
addresses the aforementioned defects.
