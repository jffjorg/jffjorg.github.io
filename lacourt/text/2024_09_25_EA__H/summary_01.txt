And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the plaintiff's application for default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff is required to provide the court with a copy of the February 1, 2023 billing statement and a statement of account. The court notes that the plaintiff's application is defective and must be resubmitted with the necessary documentation. The court's decision is based on the plaintiff's failure to provide the required information, including the February 1, 2023 billing statement, which is necessary to determine the amount owed by the defendant, NES.
