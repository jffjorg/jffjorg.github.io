DD Partners, LLC v. Davis, et al.MOTION
TO DEEM REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION ADMITTED; 
REQUEST
FOR SANCTIONS
(CCP
§ 2033.280)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
            
Plaintiff DD PARTNERS, LLC’S Motion
to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted and Request for Sanctions is GRANTED.
DEFENDANT ARTHUR DAVIS IS ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $436.26 TO PLAINTIFF’S
COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
On February 14, 2024, Plaintiff DD Partners, LLC
(“Plaintiff”) served Requests for Admissions on Defendant Arthur Davis
(“Defendant Davis”). (Motion, Shahar
Decl., Exh. A.) To date, Defendant has not served verified responses to the
Requests for Admission. (Id. at ¶4.) Plaintiff filed the instant Motion
to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted (“the Motion”) on March 15, 2024. No
opposition has been filed to date. 
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to deem requests for admission can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280.) Further, the motion can be brought at any time after the
responding party fails to provide the responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.)
Due to Defendant Davis’ failure to timely serve verified responses and
resultant waiver of objections, Plaintiff is entitled to an order deeming the
Requests for Admission admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.) 
 
The Court is required to award sanctions under the moving
statute. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) While properly noticed, the
sanctions sought are excessive. Under a lodestar calculation, sanctions are
granted against Defendant Davis in the amount of $436.26 based on one hour of
attorney time billed at $425.00 per hour, plus costs of $11.26. (Motion, Shahar
Decl., ¶6.)
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff DD PARTNERS, LLC’S Motion to Deem Requests for
Admission Admitted and Request for Sanctions is GRANTED. DEFENDANT ARTHUR DAVIS
IS ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $436.26 TO PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’
SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
