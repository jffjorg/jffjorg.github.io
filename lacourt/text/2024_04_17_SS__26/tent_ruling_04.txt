ANALYSIS:
 
On December 1, 2023, Plaintiff Clifford Johnson
(“Plaintiff”) served Special Interrogatories, Set One, on Defendants ISP2 Del
Mar, LLC (“Defendant ISP2”) and RAR2 Villa Marina Center CA SPE, Inc. (Motions, Mehrban Decl., Exh. A.) Despite a
meet-and-confer effort extending the deadline to serve verified responses
without objections, Defendants have not served responses. (Id. at ¶¶4-5
and Exh. B.) Plaintiff filed the instant Motions to Compel Responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions, on February 27, 2024. Defendants
filed untimely oppositions on April 5, 2024. 
 
The oppositions do not dispute that Defendants received the
meet and confer letter or have yet to serve verified responses after the
extended deadline of February 22, 2024. They simply contend that supplemental
responses with verifications will be provided. In fact, the oppositions are not
even supported by any legal authority or declarations. 
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to compel initial responses can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290.) Further, the motion can be brought any time after the responding
party fails to provide the responses. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290.) Based on Defendants’ failure to respond
to the propounded discovery, Plaintiff is entitled to an order compelling them
to serve verified responses to the discovery requests without objections. 
 
Defendants’ failure to timely respond constitutes a misuse
of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) Sanctions
are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030
and have been properly noticed. Sanctions are awarded against Defendants and
counsel of record in the amount of $500.00 per motion based on one hour of
attorney time billed at $500.00 per hour. (Motions, Mehrban Decl., ¶6.)
