And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendants' motion to dismiss the representative PAGA claims. The defendants had argued that the representative claims should be dismissed because the individual claims were subject to arbitration, and therefore the plaintiff lost standing to pursue the representative claims in court. However, the court has held that an individual does not lose standing to pursue representative PAGA claims in court when their individual claims are subject to arbitration. The court's decision is based on its previous ruling in July 2023, which held that individual PAGA claims are not affected by the arbitration of individual claims. The court has deferred its decision on whether to dismiss the representative claims until the California Supreme Court issued its decision in Adolph v. Uber, which was released in July 2023. The defendants are required to notice the plaintiff of the tentative ruling, and the parties may submit further arguments on the tentative ruling if they wish.

## English Summary

This tentative ruling by Judge Maurice A. Leiter addresses Defendants' motion to dismiss the representative Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) claims filed by Plaintiff Karina Lepe Tenorio. 

The Court previously granted Defendants' motion to compel Plaintiff's individual PAGA claims to arbitration.  However, the Court deferred its ruling on the representative claims pending a decision from the California Supreme Court in *Adolph v. Uber*.  In light of the Supreme Court's decision, which held that an individual does not lose standing to pursue representative PAGA claims in court even if their individual claims are subject to arbitration, the Court denies Defendants' motion to dismiss the representative PAGA claims.

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to dismiss the representative PAGA (Private Attorneys General Act) claims in the case of Karina Lepe Tenorio vs. Joya Food Enterprises, Inc. The plaintiff had filed a PAGA action against the defendants on July 30, 2021.

Based on this decision, the judge has denied the defendants' motion to dismiss the representative PAGA claims. The parties have been informed that if they wish to submit on the tentative ruling, they must email the courtroom by 8:00 am on the day of the hearing.
