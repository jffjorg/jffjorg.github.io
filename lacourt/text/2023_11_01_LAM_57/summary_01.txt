And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is regarding a dispute between lawyers and their respective law firms over a co-counseling agreement with a client. The plaintiffs, Horton Law Firm, APC and Laura L. Horton, allege that the defendants, Helen Kim Law, APC and Helen U. Kim, breached the agreement by refusing to pay their 50% share of the costs incurred in a previous case. The court granted the plaintiffs' motion to compel the defendants to provide further responses to discovery requests, specifically requests Nos. 7, 8, and 9, which seek information related to the defendants' alter ego liability. The court found that the plaintiffs had demonstrated good cause for the discovery and that the defendants' objections lacked substantial justification. Therefore, the court is sanctioning the defendants in the amount of $3,095, which reflects the attorney's fees incurred in connection with this discovery motion.
