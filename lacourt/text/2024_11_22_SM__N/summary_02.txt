And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion of the defendants (Tara Barauskas, Robert Connell, Durinda Abraham, Kyong Chang, Alan Wittert, and Community Corporation of Santa Monica) for attorney fees in the amount of $27,565.50. The defendants incurred these fees while litigating the plaintiff's (Kathleen A. Kenne) appeal of the court's order granting terminating sanctions. The court finds that the defendants are entitled to fees under Civil Code section 1942.5, which provides for attorney fees in cases of retaliatory eviction. The court reduces the amount of fees from the initial request of $106,788.00 based on the reasonableness of the hourly rate and the amount of work performed.
