And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories. The court finds that the responses received from the plaintiff were evasive and that the objections raised were meritless. The court orders the plaintiff to provide substantive responses to the form interrogatories. The defendants' motion is granted, and the court requests that defense counsel provide calculations for the requested sanctions prior to imposing sanctions on the plaintiff.
