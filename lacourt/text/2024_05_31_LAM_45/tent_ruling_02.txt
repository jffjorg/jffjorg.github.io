Background
Plaintiff
Lafayette Apt. Associates, L.P. (hereinafter “Plaintiff” or “Lafayette”) filed
this action on September 2, 2021 against Kristine Rose J. Robles, Kristian
Apple J. Robles, Roselle Poblete, and Derek Keane (“Keane”) (collectively,
“Defendants”), alleging the following causes of action: (1) Breach of Contract;
and (2) account stated. The complaint alleges that the parties entered into a
lease agreement in May 2019 for the premises located at 401 S. Lafayette Park
Place, Unit 206, Los Angeles, CA 90057. (Compl. at pg. 3; Exh. 1.) Defendants
allegedly breached the agreement on May 1, 2020 by failing to pay rent. (Id.
at pg. 3, ¶ BC-2.) Defendants allegedly owe to date a total of $39,802.47 in
past due rent. (Id. at ¶ BC-4.)
On December 6,
2022, Keane filed a Cross-Complaint on December 6, 2022 against Lafayette and
his co-defendants, alleging the following causes of action: (1) Retaliatory
Eviction; and (2) Contribution. The Cross-Complaint alleges Lafayette
unlawfully evicted Keane, who is alleged to be a third-party beneficiary
residential occupant of the subject premises, based on his inability to pay
under the then-applicable Civil Code § 1942.5(d). (Cross-Compl. ¶ 9.) Keane
alleges the eviction was wrongful since the three-day notice overstated the
amount that was actually due. (Id. at ¶ 10.) The eviction was also
wrongful because the occupants were protected by Civil Code § 1511, as their
ability to pay rent starting in March 2020 was attributable to governmental
regulations. (Id. at ¶ 11.) Further, Keane alleges the eviction violated
the City and County Covid eviction moratoria, the Tenant Relief Act of 2020 and
the Tenant Protection Act of 2019. (Id. at ¶ 12.)
On February 6,
2023, Keane filed the instant motion for summary judgment directed at
Plaintiff’s complaint.[1]
On April 11,
2024, Plaintiff filed its opposition to the instant motion. Thereafter, on
April 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed its untimely supplemental opposition papers. 
On April 17,
2024, Keane filed his reply. 
On April 25,
2024, the court continued the hearing pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §
437c(h) to May 31, 2024 in order to accommodate the taking of Keane’s
deposition. The court instructed Plaintiff to file its supplemental opposition
papers on or before May 17, 2024. Keane was permitted to file a supplemental
reply on or before May 27, 2014.
On May 17, 2024,
Plaintiff filed its second supplemental opposition papers. 
As of May 28,
2024, no supplemental reply has been received. 
 
Legal
Standard
The function of a motion for summary
judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing
party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an
order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) In
analyzing motions for summary judgment, courts must apply a three-step
analysis: “(1) identify the issues framed by the pleadings; (2) determine
whether the moving party has negated the opponent's claims; and (3) determine
whether the opposition has demonstrated the existence of a triable, material
factual issue.” (Hinesley v. Oakshade
Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.)
            As
to each claim as framed by the complaint, the defendant moving for summary
judgment must satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to negate
an essential element, or to establish a defense. (Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.)
Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing
summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that
party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006)
39 Cal.4th 384, 389.) A motion for summary judgment must be denied where the
moving party's evidence does not prove all material facts, even in the absence
of any opposition (Leyva v. Sup. Ct. (1985)
164 Cal.App.3d 462, 475) or where the opposition is weak (Salesguevara v. Wyeth Labs., Inc. (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 379, 384,
387).
 
Evidentiary
Objections
Plaintiff objects to various portions
of Keane’s declaration. The court rules as follows. Objection No. 1 is
sustained in part as to the phrase “left as the additional adult occupant of
the premises” on the ground that it is an improper legal conclusion. Objection
Nos. 2-3 are sustained on the ground that the cited declaration statements are
improper legal argument. 
            April 17, 2024, Keane objected to various portions
of the evidence submitted by Plaintiff in support of its opposition.  The court overrules these objections in their
entirety.
 
Judicial
Notice
            Keane requests the court to take
judicial notice of the Los Angeles Rent Stabilizations Ordinance of 1979. The
request is granted pursuant to Evidence Code § 452(c).
 
Discussion
A.   
Procedural Issues
Plaintiff first
argues that the instant motion for summary judgment is moot based on the filing
of the First Amended Complaint, which had been submitted on December 8, 2023.
(See Second Suppl. Opposition at pg. 10, relying on (State Compensation Ins.
Fund v. Superior Court (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1124, 1131.) This argument
presumes that the First Amended Complaint was properly filed. Rather, it was
filed without leave of court. Presently, a motion for leave to amend is set to
be heard on June 16, 2024. Until a decision is issued regarding that motion,
the initial complaint remains the operative pleadings in this action because it
has not been superseded by an amended complaint. 
Second, Plaintiff
argues that the instant motion should be denied pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure § 437c(i) because of Keane’s failure to answer questions asked of him
during his deposition on May 1, 2024. (See Second Suppl. Opposition at pp.
10-18.) 
Under Code of
Civil Procedure § 437c(i), where a continuance has been afforded pursuant to
Section 437c(h) and it has been determined that the party seeking summary
judgment has unreasonably failed to allow the discovery to be conducted, then the
court may either continue the motion to allow for the discovery to be conducted
or to deny the motion. 
Previously, the
court granted Plaintiff’s ex parte application to compel Keane’s second
deposition. (See March 19, 2024 Minute Order.) When the instant motion first
came for a hearing, it was discovered that Keane has been uncooperative by
refusing to participate in his deposition. (Suppl. Opposition filed on April
16, 2024 at pg. 4; Williamson Suppl. Decl. ¶¶ 5-7.) For this reason, the court
continued the hearing on the instant motion due to Plaintiff’s continuing need
to complete Keane’s deposition. (See April 25, 2024 Minute Order.) 
On May 1, 2024,
the parties proceeded with Keane’s third deposition, but as represented by
Plaintiff, Keane continued to be uncooperative by either giving evasive
responses or not responding to questions at all. (Second Suppl. Opposition at
pg. 12.) For instance, Keane evaded either answering whether he was a guest at
the subject property or providing an explanation for his arrangement with the
co-defendant to live in the subject property. (Second Suppl. Opposition at pp.
14-16; Williamson Suppl. Decl. ¶ 15, Exh. 16 at pp. 30:12-33:21, 35:5-41:6.) 
Also, throughout
the deposition, Keane refused to answer many questions posed by Plaintiff’s
counsel due to relevance. This is improper. (Stewart v. Colonial Western
Agency, Inc. (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 1006, 1014 [“irrelevance alone is an
insufficient ground to justify preventing a witness from answering a question
posed at a deposition.”].) Upon review of the deposition transcript, it did not
appear that Keane was asked to answer any questions that implicated a
privilege, privacy, or legal contention. (Id. at 1014-15; Rifkind v.
Superior Court (1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 1255, 1259 [questions of legal
contention seek answers that “state all facts, list all witnesses and identify
all documents that support or pertain to a particular contention in that party’s
pleadings” and are reserved for interrogatories].) 
Under these
circumstances, the Court finds that Keane has “unreasonably failed to allow the
discovery to be conducted,” and based on his repeated refusal to answer
deposition questions and evasive answers, a second continuance would be futile
without an order pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 2025.480. (See Code Civ.
Proc. § 437c(i).) Thus, on this ground, the motion is properly denied. 
B.    
Merits
Even assuming
that the motion should not be denied under Code of Civil Procedure § 437c(i),
the court finds that there are triable issues of material fact that Keane was a
party to the lease agreement. 
Here, Keane
moves for summary adjudication of the first cause of action for breach of
contract and the second cause of action for account stated on the ground that
he was not a party to lease and that there were no prior transactions between
the parties. (Motion at pp. 2-5.) In support of this argument, Keane relies on
the lease agreement and the rental application for the subject property.
(Motion, Keane Decl., Exhs. A-B.) It is evident that Keane’s signature is
missing from the lease agreement. On this basis, the court finds that Keane has
met his burden in showing that there are no triable issues of material fact
that he was a tenant of the subject property. Thus, the burden now shifts to
Plaintiff to show that there is a triable issue of material fact. 
In opposition,
Plaintiff relies on the following evidence. Within the deposition of Roselie
Poblete, she attests that Keane was only allowed to move into the subject
property after a signing a lease contract together with the other co-defendants.
(Second Suppl. Opposition, Exh. 4, Poblete Depo. at pp. 11:19-12:6, 15:15-16:11.)
This evidence creates the inference that Keane was tenant under the lease
agreement. Furthermore, based on the correspondence Keane had sent to
Plaintiff’s representative on May 26, 2020, it appears that Keane subleased the
subject property from the co-defendants, and he was approved to move in based
on his rental application and Defendant Roselie Poblete representation that she
rental payments would come from her. (Second Suppl. Opposition at pg. 20, Exh.
9.) This further strengthens the inference that Keane had permission to occupy
the subject property. Because Keane has refused to cooperate during his various
depositions, there remains a triable issue of material fact as to whether Keane
was a tenant or a sublessee during his occupancy of the subject property.  Nevertheless, because this evidence shows
that Keane had a right to occupy the subject property but continued to remain
in possession without Plaintiff’s consent after May 27. 2020, there is a
triable issue of fact as to whether a holdover tenancy was created, which
lasted for ten months. (Id. at pp. 22-23, Exhs. 4 Poblete Depo at pp.
28:5-10, 31:16-18; Exhs. 9, 10, 12, 14, 15.) 
Accordingly,
there are several triable issues of fact regarding the circumstances of Keane’s
occupancy of the subject property that preclude summary judgment.
 
Based on the foregoing, the court denies Keane’s motion for summary
judgment
 
It is so
ordered.
