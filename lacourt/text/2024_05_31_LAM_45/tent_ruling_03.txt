Background
Plaintiff CR&R,
Incorporated filed this action on March 2, 2022 against defendant Robert
O’Neill, individually and dba Simple Dumpsters, alleging causes of action for
(1) Common Count for Account Stated; (2) Common Count for Open Book Account;
(3) Common Count for Services Rendered; and (4) Quantum Meruit. The Complaint
alleges the following. On February 1, 2019, Plaintiff entered into an Asset
Purchase Agreement, acquiring the assets of United Pacific Waste (UPW). (Compl.
¶ 7.) UPW previously entered into a contract to prove waste disposal services
to Defendant. (Id.) Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement,
Plaintiff to agreed to continue proving waste disposal services to Defendant. (Id.
at ¶ 8.) Defendant paid for the services rendered but stopped paying on June
15, 2020, resulting in an unpaid outstanding balance due to Plaintiff. (Id.
at ¶¶ 9-12.)
On April 30,
2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to compel Defendant’s deposition.
On May 17, 2024,
Defendant filed his opposition papers. 
On May 23, 2024,
Plaintiff filed its reply. 
 
Legal
Standard
Code of Civil Procedure § 2025.450(a)
states: “If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an
officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person
designated by an organization that is a party under Section 2025.230, without
having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.”
The motion must be accompanied by a
declaration showing a reasonable and good faith attempt to informally resolve
each issue presented or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and
produce the requested documents or things, the motion must be accompanied by a
declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire
about the nonappearance. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.450(b)(2).)
 
Discussion
            Meet
and Confer
            Based
on the declaration submitted by Defendant’s counsel, the Court finds that Plaintiff
has sufficiently met and conferred in compliance with Code of Civil
Procedure § 2025.450(b)(2).) (Beam Decl. ¶¶ 9-11, Exhs. 11-16.)

 
Merit
of the Motion
            Here,
Plaintiff moves to compel Defendant’s deposition. After extensive back and
forth, the parties eventually agreed to schedule Defendant’s deposition for
January 11, 2024, but neither Defendant nor his counsel appeared for the
scheduled deposition. (Beam Decl. ¶¶ 7-8, Exh. 6-10.) When Plaintiff’s counsel
attempted to inquire as to Defendant’s failure to appear, his counsel did not
provide a specific reason. (Beam Decl. ¶ 9, Exh. 11.) 
            In
opposition, Defendant argues that the motion is premature and does not comply
with Section 2025.450 because his deposition had been re-noticed on April 23,
2024 for May 21, 2024 and the instant motion was filed on April 30, 2024.
(Opposition at pp. 2-3.) These arguments are not persuasive because it
overlooks the fact that Defendant failed to appear for his properly scheduled
January 11, 2024 deposition hearing. Thus, the instant motion is procedurally
proper, notwithstanding the fact that Plaintiff attempted to re-notice the
deposition. Therefore, under the circumstances, the court finds that there is
ground to compel Defendant’s deposition based on his failure to appear to his
January 11, 2024 deposition hearing. 
Accordingly, the
Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s deposition. Defendant’s
deposition shall take place on the date, time, and location set forth above.
 
Request for Monetary Sanctions
            Plaintiff requests $5,015 in
monetary sanctions against Defendant and his counsel of record, jointly and
severally. Plaintiff’s counsels’ hourly rates are $350 for Counsel Gregory Beam
and $300 for Counsel Paul Breen. (Beam Decl. ¶ 12.) Counsel Beam attests having
spent 3.1 hours on the instant motion and that Counsel Breen has spent 5.9
hours on the instant motion. (Ibid.) Counsel Beam further anticipates an
additional 6 hours in reviewing the opposition, preparing the reply, and
attending the hearing. (Ibid.) 
            Under the circumstances, the court
finds that sanctions are warranted under Code of Civil Procedure §
2025.450(g)(1) because Defendant has not shown that the imposition of sanctions
would be unjust or that he acted with substantial justification. While the
hourly rates requested are reasonable, the amount in sanctions is not because
the instant motion concerns an uncomplicated discovery issue that does not
justify the amounts sought. However, the court recognizes the substantial delay
and costs Defendant created in failing to cooperate in discovery without
sufficient justification. The court finds that reducing Plaintiff’s time spent
on the motion in half is reasonable. As for Plaintiff’s anticipated hours,
based on the limited scope of the opposition and the likelihood that
appearances will be conducted remotely, the court reduces the anticipated hours
from six to two. Therefore, Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions against
Defendant and his attorney of record, jointly and severally, reduced to
$2,187.50, inclusive of the $60 filed fee. 
            Accordingly, the court GRANTS
Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions against Defendant and his counsel of
record, jointly and severally, in the reduced amount of $2,187.50. The court
orders Defendant and his counsel of record to pay this amount within 20 days of
the date of this motion to Plaintiff’s counsel. 
It is so
ordered.
