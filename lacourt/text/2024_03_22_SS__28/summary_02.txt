And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case, denying the plaintiff's motion to compel DirectTV to produce its person most knowledgeable for deposition. The plaintiff had argued that the deposition of Daniel Hernandez, who was produced by DirectTV as its person most knowledgeable, was terminated prematurely because Hernandez did not have the necessary knowledge to answer the plaintiff's questions. The judge found that the plaintiff did not sufficiently meet and confer with DirectTV before filing the motion, as required by the California Code of Civil Procedure. The judge ordered the parties to meet and confer to resolve the issue informally, and if the plaintiff can show that it has made a good faith effort to meet and confer, it may file a new motion.
