The Court also found that the Plaintiff did not carry the burden of showing that the communication sought to be suppressed falls within the parameters of the attorney-client privilege. The Court weighed the need for the limited discovery against the Plaintiff's privacy rights and concluded that the subpoena is not overbroad and does not violate the Plaintiff's privacy rights.
