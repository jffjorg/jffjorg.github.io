Summary in English text:

The tentative ruling concerns a motion by Counsel, Russell & Lazarus, Marc Lazarus, and Jorge F. Ramirez, to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff, Federico Hernandez. The motion is unopposed. The Court finds that the reason for withdrawal, a breakdown in the attorney-client working relationship, is valid. However, the proposed order is incomplete and contains errors, so Counsel must file and serve an updated proposed order. The Court conditionally grants the motion pending the updated proposed order and requires Counsel to provide notice of the ruling.
