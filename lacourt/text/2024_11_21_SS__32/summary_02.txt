And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants Palisades Homeowners Association #3's motion for summary adjudication on its cross-complaint against Adam and Amanda Gruen. The cross-complaint alleges that the Gruens owe a contractual duty to defend and indemnify the HOA against the Plaintiffs' claims. The HOA argues that the Gruens' ownership of the pit bull that attacked the Plaintiffs' children is a breach of their duty of care and that they are liable for any damages caused by their pet.

The court finds that the HOA has the obligation to defend and indemnify the Gruens against the Plaintiffs' claims and that the duty to defend arises immediately upon a proper tender of defense by the indemnitee. The court also finds that the duty to defend continues until the underlying lawsuit is concluded or until it has been shown that there is no potential for coverage.

The court grants the motion for summary adjudication and orders the moving party to provide notice of this ruling and file a proof of service of such.
