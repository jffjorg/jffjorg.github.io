[1] Section
583.130 states: “[i]t is the policy of the state that a plaintiff shall proceed
with reasonable diligence in the prosecution of an action but that all parties
shall cooperate in bringing the action to trial or other disposition. Except as
otherwise provided by statute or by rule of court adopted pursuant to statute,
the policy favoring the right of parties to make stipulations in their own
interests and the policy favoring trial or other disposition of an action on
the merits are generally to be preferred over the policy that requires
dismissal for failure to proceed with reasonable diligence in the prosecution
of an action in construing the provisions of this chapter.


[2]
Plaintiff’s counsel had asserted there was a breakdown in attorney-client
communication.
