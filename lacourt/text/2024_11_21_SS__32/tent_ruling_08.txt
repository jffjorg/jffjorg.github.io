MOTION
 
On September 15, 2023, Plaintiff Moses Eduardo Garcia (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan
Transportation Authority (“Defendant”) asserting a cause of action for
dangerous condition of public property under Government Code sections 835,
840.2, 840.4, and negligence under Government Code section 815 et seq. 
 
Defendant now demurs to the complaint arguing that it fails to state sufficient
facts and does so without sufficient particularity. No opposition was filed. 
 
On October 8, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s counsel’s motion to
be relieved, after Counsel asserted that Plaintiff had been released from
custody and was personally served the moving papers. (Min. Order, 10/8/24.) The
Order Relieving Counsel was mailed to Plaintiff’s address on October 21, 2024,
and proof of service was filed on October 22, 2024. Therefore, Plaintiff is
currently self-represented. 
 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
The primary function of a pleading is to give the other party notice
so that it may prepare its case [citation], and a defect in a pleading that
otherwise properly notifies a party cannot be said to affect substantial
rights.” (Harris v. City of Santa Monica (2013) 56 Cal.4th 203, 240.) “A demurrer tests the
legal sufficiency of the factual allegations in a complaint.” (Ivanoff v.
Bank of America, N.A. (2017)
9 Cal.App.5th 719, 725.) It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form
or content of the opposing party's pleading (complaint, answer or
cross-complaint).  (Code Civ. Proc. §§
422.10, 589; see Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th
968, 994.)  It is not the function of the
demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for purposes of
the ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are assumed to
be true.  (Donabedian, 116
Cal.App.4th at 994.)
 
A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the
face of the pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading that
are judicially noticeable.  (Blank v.
Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian, supra, 116 Cal.App.4th
at 994.)  No other extrinsic evidence can
be considered.  (Ion Equip. Corp. v.
Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 881 [error for court to consider facts
asserted in memorandum supporting demurrer]; see also Afuso v. United States
Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862 [disapproved on other
grounds in Moradi-Shalal v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d
287] [error to consider contents of release not part of court record].) A
demurrer can be utilized where the “face of the complaint” itself is incomplete
or discloses some defense that would bar recovery.  (Guardian North Bay, Inc. v. Superior
Court (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 963, 971-72.) 

 
 
MEET
AND CONFER
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41 requires that “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this
chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone
with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the
purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve
the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd.
(a).) The parties are to meet and confer at least five days before the date the
responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(2).)
Thereafter, the demurring party shall file and serve a declaration detailing
their meet and confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(3).)
 
Defendant’s counsel, Eitan
Yehoshua, declares the following: “Before filing the instant demurrer I called
Plaintiff at the number provided by former counsel in the Order Granting
Counsel's Motion to be Relieved- (213) 408-5752. A woman answered the phone and
advised me that I have the wrong telephone number. On October 23, 2024, I
conducted a Los Angeles County inmate search which revealed that Plaintiff is
currently serving a criminal sentence. Accordingly, a meet and confer on this
matter was not possible.” (Yehoshua Decl. ¶ 2-3.)
 
Even if a meet and confer was
not possible, “[a] determination by the court that the meet and confer process
was insufficient shall not be grounds to overrule or sustain a demurrer.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 430.41 (a)(4).)
 
ANALYSIS
 
Government Code section 815 provides that “[a] public entity is not
liable for an injury, whether such injury arises out of an act or omission of
the public entity or a public employee or any other person” except as provided
by statute. (Gov. Code, § 815, subd. (a); see Hoff v. Vacaville Unified
School Dist. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 925, 932.) “[D]irect tort liability of
public entities must be based on a specific statute declaring them to be
liable, or at least creating some specific duty of care, and not on the general
tort provisions of Civil Code section 1714. Otherwise, the general rule of
immunity for public entities would be largely eroded by the routine application
of general tort principles.” (Eastburn v. Regional Fire Protection Authority
(2003) 31 Cal.4th 1175, 1183.) Consequently, “public
entities may be liable only if a statute declares them to be liable.”  (Tuthill
v. City of San Buenaventura (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 1081, 1088 (emphasis in
the original). It has been recognized that it is impermissible to sue a public
entity for common law negligence. (Torres v. Department of Corrections and
Rehabilitation (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 844, 850.)   
 
Moreover, to state a cause of action [for government tort
liability] every fact essential to the existence of statutory liability must be
pleaded with particularity, including the existence of a statutory duty.” 
(Searcy v. Hemet Unified School Dist. (1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 792,
802.) 
 
Government Code section 835 states:¿“Except as provided by statute, a public entity is
liable for injury caused by a dangerous condition of its property if the
plaintiff establishes that the property was in a dangerous condition at the
time of the injury, that the injury was proximately caused by the dangerous
condition, that the dangerous condition created a reasonably foreseeable risk
of the kind of injury which was incurred, and either:¿ 
 
(a) A
negligent or wrongful act or omission of an employee of the public entity
within the scope of his employment created the dangerous condition; or¿¿ 
 
(b) The
public entity had actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition
under Section 835.2
a sufficient time prior to the injury to have taken measures to protect against
the dangerous condition.”¿¿ 
 
 As an initial matter, the Court on
its own motion takes judicial notice that Defendant is a public entity as
defined by the California Government Code.  (Gov. Code § 811.2 [“’Public
entity includes . . . a county city, district, public authority,
public agency, and any other political subdivision or public corporation in the
State.”].)
 
Here, the
complaint alleges that Plaintiff was injured at Defendant’s metro station. The
complaint further alleges:
 
“On February 5, 2023, Plaintiff was a pedestrian
on the PREMISES when he fell and or was situated near, on, onto, or within the
surrounding train tracks. At that same time and place, defendants, and each of
them, drove, managed, engineered, operated, conducted, maintained, and/or
entrusted DEFENDANT’S TRAIN such that the same was caused to and did then and
there strike Plaintiff’s person and body which resulted in several and various
severe injuries to Plaintiff, including an amputated leg.”
(Complaint ¶ 11.) 
 
The first cause of action also alleges the
following:
 
“Prior to February 5, 2023, an employee, or
employees of Defendants, and each of them, negligently designed, built,
constructed and/or maintained the PREMISES such that the platform, landing,
pedestrian waiting and loading area, and surrounding entering and exiting train
tracks were in a dangerous condition and exceeded reasonable design guidelines
and practices.” (Complaint ¶ 15.) 
 
The second cause of action alleges the following: 
 
“On or about February 5, 2023, an employee, or
employees of Defendants, and ROES 11 through 20, and each of them, negligently,
recklessly, and unlawfully conducted, engineered, drove, owned and operated
DEFENDANT’S TRAIN such that said train came into contact with the body and
person of Plaintiff on the train tracks abutting, adjacent to, and surrounding
the PREMISES, despite the conductors, operators, engineers, drivers and
operators of DEFNDANT’S TRAIN having sufficient time to stop, halt, pause and
avoid Plaintiff’s person and body had such conductors, engineers, drivers, and
operators exercised due care and proper safety guidelines, procedures and
policies thereto.” 
(Complaint ¶ 29.) 
 
 
Neither cause of
action is sufficiently pled. The first cause of action does not describe what
constituted the dangerous condition. The second cause of action, which appears
to be based on the train operator’s failure to stop the train before hitting
Plaintiff, only cites to Government Code section 815 et seq. Because the
complaint does not tie the allegations to a specific statute, it is not plead
with particularity. Accordingly, the demurrer is sustained. 
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court SUSTAINS the demurrer, with leave to amend. Any
amended complaint must be filed and served within 30 days.
 
Defendant shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
