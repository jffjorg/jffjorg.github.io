And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant William M. Lengyel's Motion for Reconsideration of the order dismissing the case. The case involves Plaintiff Justin Beimforde, dba Justin Beimforde Real Estate Broker, Inc., who alleges that Defendant Lengyel breached the Listing Agreements for the sale of a property located at 22040 Placeritos Blvd., Santa Clarita. The Judge denies the motion for reconsideration, finding that the Plaintiff has not provided new or different facts or circumstances to support the motion. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff's arguments against the merits of the order dismissing the case are unpersuasive, and that the Plaintiff's disagreement with the order is not a new fact that warrants reconsideration.
