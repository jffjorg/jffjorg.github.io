  Case Number:  23STCV14415    Hearing Date:   August 16, 2024    Dept:  55 Tentative Ruling 23STCV14415
 
NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:
Defendant William M. Lengyel’s Motion for Reconsideration
 
BACKGROUND
In this case, JUSTIN BEIMFORDE, dba JUSTIN BEIMFORDE
REAL ESTATE BROKER, INC. (“Plaintiff”) alleges that WILLIAM LENGYEL (“Defendant”)
engaged Plaintiff as the exclusive agent for the sale of Defendant’s vested interest
in the property located at 22040 Placeritos Blvd., Santa Clarita (“Property”) pursuant
to two contracts called, “Exclusive Right to Represent Owner for Sale or Lease
of Real Property” (“Listing Agreements”). Plaintiff alleges that Defendant
breached the Listing Agreements. 
Plaintiff filed his Complaint in pro per in June 2023
and litigated the case in pro per until he substituted in counsel on May 29, 2024.
Plaintiff appeared in court in pro per for three continued case management
conferences between December 2023 and April 2024. 
Defendant filed and served a motion to dismiss the
case on March 21, 2024, arguing that the Complaint in this case is based on the
same listing agreements as Plaintiff’s prior lawsuit for declaratory relief (21STLC03615)
against Defendant, which resulted in a final judgment (the “First Action”). On
June 5, 2024, two days before the scheduled hearing on the motion to dismiss, the
Court denied Plaintiff’s ex parte application to continue the hearing and
for leave to file a late opposition, finding that Plaintiff had not provided good
cause for the relief sought. On June 7, 2024, the Court granted Defendant’s motion
to dismiss the case.
Plaintiff now seeks reconsideration of the order
dismissing the case. Defendant opposes the motion.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
Code of Civil Procedure Section 1008 provides that a
party may move for reconsideration of an order “based upon new or different
facts, circumstances, or law.” Code Civ. P. § 1008(a). The moving party must
state such new or different facts, circumstances, or law in an affidavit, see
id., “which it could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered and
produced at the time of the prior motion.... 
A motion for reconsideration will be denied absent a strong showing of
diligence.” Forrest v. Dept. Of Corps. (2007) 150 Cal. App. 4th 183,
202, disapproved on other grounds by Shalant
v. Girardi (2011) 51 Cal. 4th 1164, 1172. See also Baldwin v. Home Sav.
of Am. (1997) 59 Cal. App. 4th 1192, 1199 (noting that 1992
amendment to CCP §1008 tightened diligence requirements). 
Disagreement with a ruling is not a new fact that will
support the granting of a motion for reconsideration. Gilberd v.  AC Transit (1995) 32 Cal. App. 4th 1494,
1500.  A new fact that is collateral to
the merits, such as counsel’s desire to argue further, does not warrant
reconsideration. Id., 32 Cal. App. 4th at 1500; Garcia v. Hejmadi
(1997) 58 Cal. App. 4th 674, 690. Counsel’s unsworn assertions or arguments are
not evidence and will not support a finding of fact.  DiCola v. White Bros. Performance Products,
Inc. (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 666, 682; see also Ev. C. §500
(general burden of proof on party asserting claim or defense).
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
The Court grants Plaintiff’s Request for Judicial Notice
of 11 court documents.
ANALYSIS
Plaintiff seeks reconsideration of the Court’s order based
on what he terms “new and different facts and circumstances.” As discussed below,
his purported new and different facts and circumstances are events that
Plaintiff has known about for years or mere disagreements with the Court’s
ruling.
Plaintiff contends that Defendant asked Plaintiff to
file the First Action in 2021, and that he only learned that Defendant had
breached the Listing Agreements in or around March 2022. He also acknowledges
that the judgment in the First Action was entered in June 2023, right around
when he filed this case and after he learned of the alleged breaches of the
Listing Agreements. Plaintiff’s description of the alleged facts giving rise to
the First Action and this case is not a new fact or circumstance that warrants
reconsideration. Plaintiff knew about all these events well before Defendant
filed the motion to dismiss. Indeed, he knew about them when he filed this
case. Furthermore, Plaintiff has not provided any cogent and persuasive
explanation for why he failed to present these facts earlier. 
Plaintiff further argues that Court’s order dismissing
the case on res judicata grounds is factually and legally erroneous. Plaintiff
contends that the order is based on the erroneous conclusion that the First
Action included a breach of contract claim, but this is flatly untrue as the
Court order concludes that this case, which is based on the same Listing Agreements
as the First Action, is barred on res judicata grounds even though the cases
involve different causes of action. Plaintiff also contends that he did not
seek compensatory relief in the First Action because he was unaware of any alleged
breach at the time he filed the First Action, but this is unpersuasive given
that he states elsewhere in his declaration that he knew about the alleged
breach in March 2022, well before the judgment in the First Action in June
2023. 
Plaintiff also contends that case law militates
against the Court’s order on the motion to dismiss. But the cases cited are
from 2002 and 2010, well before the filing of the motion to dismiss. They
certainly do not amount to new law. Plaintiff also takes issue with the statute
cited in Defendant’s notice of hearing on the motion, but this is of no matter
because the Court did not rely on that statute in its ruling. All of Plaintiff’s
arguments against the merits of the Court’s order also fail because disagreeing
with the Court’s ruling does not support a motion for reconsideration.
For all these reasons, the motion for reconsideration
is DENIED.
