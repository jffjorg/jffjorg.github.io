Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff, Cesar Cruz, has alleged four causes of action against the defendants, Tina Odjaghian Law Group, et al., for breach of contract, fraud, general negligence, and intentional tort. However, the judge has found that the plaintiff's complaint is uncertain and fails to state a claim for each of these causes of action.

Specifically, the judge has found that the plaintiff's complaint does not allege with sufficient specificity the terms of the alleged contract, and fails to plead the existence of a written or oral contract. The judge has also found that the plaintiff's allegations of fraud are conclusory and fail to plead the necessary elements of a fraud cause of action.

The judge has given the plaintiff 20 days to amend his complaint to cure these defects. The defendants' demurrer to each of the four causes of action has been sustained, and the case will proceed with the amended complaint.

English summary:
The tentative ruling is for a case numbered 23STCV12365, with a hearing date of September 25, 2023, in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles. The plaintiff, Cesar Cruz, brought a complaint against the Tina Odjaghian Law Group, Tina Odjaghian, Wil Fabian, and Elizabeth Fabian. The defendants filed an unopposed demurrer to the complaint, and the court sustained it with 20 days leave to amend. The demurrer was based on uncertainty and failure to state a claim for the first through fourth causes of action. The court applied the legal standard that a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint, and all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed to be true. The court found that the complaint was uncertain and failed to state a claim for breach of contract, fraud, general negligence, and intentional tort. The court provided specific reasons for each cause of action, citing relevant case law and statutes. Ultimately, the court concluded that the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's first, second, third, and fourth causes of action in his complaint is sustained with 20 days leave to amend. The moving party is required to give notice.

**Court:** Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles

**Parties:**

* **Plaintiff:** Cesar Cruz (pro per)
* **Defendants:** Tina Odjaghian Law Group, Tina Odjaghian, Wil Fabian, Elizabeth Fabian

**Summary:**

The Judge has ruled that the Defendant's demurrer to Plaintiff Cesar Cruz's complaint is **sustained with 20 days leave to amend.** This means the Court found flaws in Cruz's complaint that prevent it from properly proceeding, but gave him time to fix those flaws.

**Reasons for Sustaining Demurrer:**

The Judge found Cruz's complaint **uncertain** in several ways, making it difficult for the Defendants to understand the claims against them. Specifically, Cruz failed to:

* **Clearly state the terms of the alleged contract:** He mentioned a retainer agreement but did not specify its contents.
* **Identify specific acts or omissions:** He listed various potential torts but did not explain how they applied to the Defendants.
* **Provide supporting evidence:**  He referenced attachments that were not included in the complaint.

**Causes of Action:**

The Judge addressed four causes of action raised by Cruz:

* **Breach of Contract:** The complaint failed to adequately describe the contract, Cruz's performance, and the Defendants' breach.
* **Fraud:** Cruz failed to specify the representations made, when and how they were made, and how he relied on them to his detriment.
* **General Negligence:** The complaint did not clearly establish a legal duty owed by the Defendants, breach of that duty, causation, or damages suffered.
* **Intentional Tort:** Cruz listed various intentional torts without explaining which one applied and providing supporting facts.

**Next Steps:**

Cruz has 20 days to amend his complaint, addressing the issues raised by the Judge.
