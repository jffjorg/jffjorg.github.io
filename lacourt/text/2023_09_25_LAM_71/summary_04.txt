Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff, Cesar Cruz, has alleged four causes of action against the defendants, Tina Odjaghian Law Group, et al., for breach of contract, fraud, general negligence, and intentional tort. However, the judge has found that the plaintiff's complaint is uncertain and fails to state a claim for each of these causes of action.

Specifically, the judge has found that the plaintiff's complaint does not allege with sufficient specificity the terms of the alleged contract, and fails to plead the existence of a written or oral contract. The judge has also found that the plaintiff's allegations of fraud are conclusory and fail to plead the necessary elements of a fraud cause of action.

The judge has given the plaintiff 20 days to amend his complaint to cure these defects. The defendants' demurrer to each of the four causes of action has been sustained, and the case will proceed with the amended complaint.
