 Case Number:  BC663601    Hearing Date:   September 25, 2023    Dept:  71             Plaintiff,
Kip Pierce, applies ex parte for an order specially setting his November 13,
2023 and November 15, 2023 motions for reconsideration of the Court’s order of
April 27, 2022, (denying his request to “reopen” his case).  The Court denies the application on the
grounds that Judgment was entered in this matter on April 26, 2019, such that
the Court now lacks jurisdiction to grant the requested relief.
