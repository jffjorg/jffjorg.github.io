And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is to deny the motion for attorney's fees filed by Defendant Bag Fund, LLC. The motion is based on Civil Code Section 1717, which allows a party to recover reasonable attorney's fees and costs if they are specifically provided for in a contract. However, Defendant's motion fails to explain what contract and action it is referring to that supports its request for attorney's fees. The Judge is not convinced that there is a valid basis for awarding attorney's fees without more information about the underlying contract and action.
