  Case Number:  21STCV43055    Hearing Date:   October 23, 2023    Dept:  57  The Court's tentative decision is to deny the motion for attorney's fees filed by Defendant Bag Fund, LLC.  The motion is based on Civil Code Section 1717, which  provides that " [i]n any action on a contract where the contract specifically provides that attorney's fees and costs,
which are incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the
prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract shall
be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees in addition to other costs. "  Defendant's motion does not explain what is the contract and action thereupon that supports its request for attorney's fees under Section 1717.  Presumably, there was a contract in the underlying action that led to the judgment that the Plaintiff in this action sought to vacate.  But the motion makes no reference to that contract.
