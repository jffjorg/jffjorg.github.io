BACKGROUND
 
On December 10, 2020, Plaintiff Ron A.
Rosen Jonfaza (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants 1875/1925
Century Park East Company (“Century Park”), Watt Properties, Inc. (“Watt
Properties”), Pocrass & De Los Reyes, LLP (“Pocrass & De Los Reyes”),
James Pocrass (“Pocrass”), Michael Devore (“Devore”), Abrams & Taheri LLP (“Abrams
& Taheri”), and Does 1 to 50 alleging two causes of action: (1) general negligence;
and (2) premises liability.
 
On June 6, 2024, the action was
reassigned to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B at Van Nuys
Courthouse East, effective June 24, 2024.
 
On October 17, 2024, Pocrass & De Los Reyes, Pocrass, and Devore
(collectively “Defendants”) filed the instant motions to compel Plaintiff’s
further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories,
Set One, and Request for Production of Documents, Set One (“Discovery
Motions”). Defendants also request sanctions.
 
Plaintiff did not file an opposition.
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Defendants’ Discovery Motions are
GRANTED.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
Interrogatories
 
Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 2030.300 provides,
in pertinent part, that “[o]n receipt of a response to interrogatories, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response if the
propounding party deems that any of the following apply: (1) An answer to a
particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete. (2) An exercise of the
option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the
required specification of those documents is inadequate. (3) An objection to an
interrogatory is without merit or too general.” (CCP § 2030.300(a).) 
 
Unless notice of a motion to compel
further responses is given within 45 days of the service of the verified
response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific
later date to which the propounding party and the responding party have agreed
in writing, the propounding party waives any right to compel a further
response. (CCP § 2030.300(c).) 
 
Request for Production of Documents
 
CCP § 2031.310 provides, in pertinent part,
that “[o]n receipt of a response to demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling, the demanding party may move for an order compelling further response
to the demand if the demanding party deems that any of the following apply: (1)
A statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete. (2) A representation
of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive. (3) An objection
in the response is without merit or too general.” (CCP § 2031.310(a).)
 
Unless notice of a motion to compel
further responses is given within 45 days of the service of the verified
response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific
later date to which the propounding party and the responding party have agreed
in writing, the propounding party waives any right to compel a further
response. (CCP § 2031.310(c).) 
 
Under California law, the objecting party has the burden
of justifying its objections when the propounding party requests that the Court
order further responses. (Coy v. Superior Court (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210,
220-221.) Further, under CCP § 2023.010, it is a misuse of discovery to make
unmerited objections. (CCP § 2023.010(e).) 
 
DISCUSSION
Meet and Confer
Requirement
A motion to compel further responses shall be accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration. (CCP § 2030.300(b); CCP § 2031.310(b).) Defendants
initially propounded Discovery Motions upon Plaintiff on June 26, 2024. (Marchi
Decl. ¶ 2; Exh. 1 [service]; Exh. 2 [discovery requests].) After various
extensions agreed upon by both parties, Plaintiff served Defendants with
responses to their Discovery Motions on September 26, 2024. (Ibid. at ¶
7; Exh, 12 [service of responses]; Exh. 13 [responses].) However, these
responses objected to Defendants’ discovery requests in their entirety. (Ibid.
at ¶ 7; Exh. 13.)
 
On October 3, 2024, Defendants sent a meet and confer
email to Plaintiff’s counsel, noting the objections and requesting that
Plaintiff provide substantive, verified, and amended responses by October 10,
2024. (Ibid. at ¶ 8; Exh. 15 [October 3, 2024, email].) On October 10,
2024, Plaintiff’s counsel called and requested an extension. (Ibid. at ¶
9.) Defendants denied this request, noting that, due to previous extensions,
Plaintiff had 106 days to provide substantive responses. (Ibid. at ¶¶ 9
and 11; Exh. 17 [October 10, 2024, email regarding counsels’ telephone conversation].)
 
To date, Defendants have not received Plaintiff’s
supplemental responses to discovery or proof of service thereof. (Ibid. at
¶ 15.) Therefore, Defendants satisfy the meet and confer requirements of CCP §§
2030.300(b) and 2031.310(b).
 
Form Interrogatories, Set One
Defendants move to compel Plaintiff’s further responses
to Form Interrogatories, Set One, in its entirety.
Defendants’ motion is granted.
 
Here, Plaintiff provided the same boilerplate objection
to each and every one of Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories. The identical
objections state as follow:
“Objection. Responding Party objects to this
interrogatory as it seeks irrelevant 
matter not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery
of admissible evidence  in
the subject lawsuit.”
(Marchi Decl. Exh. 13 [Plaintiff’s responses].)
 
Form interrogatories were created and approved by the
Judicial Council to allow discovery into information regarding an individual’s
general background information. A party responding to these interrogatories
owes a duty to respond in good faith as best as possible. (Deyo v. Kilbourne
(1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 783.)
Here, Plaintiff failed to respond in a substantive
manner. Therefore, Plaintiff is ordered to provide verified, objection-free,
supplemental responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, in its entirety.
Special Interrogatories, Set One
Defendants move to compel Plaintiff’s further responses
to Special Interrogatories, Set One, in its entirety.
Defendants’ motion is granted.
Here, Plaintiff provided the same boilerplate objection
to each and every one of Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories. The
identical objections state as follow:
“Objection. Responding Party objects to this
interrogatory as it seeks irrelevant 
matter not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery
of admissible evidence  in
the subject lawsuit. This request is overly broad and unduly burdensome in 
scope and remote in its time span as to be excessively
burdensome, oppressing, 
and harassing. Greyhound Corp. v. Superior Court
(1961) 56 Cal.2d 355.”
(Marchi Decl. Exh. 13 [Plaintiff’s responses].)
 
Here, Plaintiff failed to respond in a substantive
manner. Therefore, Plaintiff is ordered to provide verified, objection-free,
supplemental responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, in its entirety.
Request for Production of Documents, Set One
Defendants move to compel Plaintiff’s further responses
to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, in its entirety.
Defendants’ motion is granted.
Here, Plaintiff provided the same boilerplate objection
to each and every one of Plaintiff’s Request for Production of
Documents. The identical objections state as follow:
“Objection. This request is improper because
it fails to designate 
documents by specifically describing each
individual item or by reasonably 
particularizing each category of item in
contravention of Code of Civil Procedure 
§2031.030(c)(1). This request is overly broad
and unduly burdensome in scope 
and remote in its time span as to be excessively
burdensome, oppressing, and 
harassing. Greyhound Corp. V. Superior
Court (1961) 56 Cal.2d 355. This request 
is vague, ambiguous, and overbroad which
calls into speculation what this 
request means or is referring to. This
request is objected to on the grounds that 
it seeks documents that are protected by the
anticipation of litigation privilege, 
attorney/client privilege, and/or
work-product rule. See e.g. Payless Drug Stores,
Inc. v. Superior Court (1976) 54
Cal.App.3d 988; Rodriguez v. McDonnell Douglas 
Corp., (1978) Cal.App.3d 626,
647-648; Nacht & Lewis Architects, Inc. v. Superior 
Court, (1996) 47 Cal.App.4th
214. Subject to and without waiving said 
objections, Responding Party responds as
follows: The documents requested are
equally available to Defendants.”
 
(Marchi Decl. Exh. 13 [Plaintiff’s responses].)
 
Defendants’ requests for production of documents are, by
and large, specific and related to the underlying incident. Additionally, they
are not equally available to Defendants as Plaintiff claims. Many of them
relate to Plaintiff’s alleged injuries, economic damages, and contentions of
that nature.
Plaintiff failed to respond in a substantive manner.
Therefore, Plaintiff is ordered to provide verified, objection-free,
supplemental responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, in its
entirety.
Monetary
Sanctions
 
“The court may impose a
monetary sanction against a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process, or any attorney advising that conduct” under CCP § 2023.030(a). A
court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone
Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th
771, 791.)
 
Here,
Plaintiff failed to substantively respond to Defendants’ Discovery Motions
without substantial justification, constituting a misuse of the discovery
process. In fact, Plaintiff’s universal boilerplate objections to Defendants’
Discovery Motions have the practical effect of not responding at all.
Therefore, monetary sanctions are appropriate.
 
Form Interrogatories, Set One
 
Defendants request monetary sanctions in the
amount of $1,184.00 for their motion to compel Plaintiff’s further responses to
Form Interrogatories, Set One, representing 6.4 hours of work at an hourly rate
of $185.00 (Marchi Decl. ¶¶ 16-19.) The Court reduces monetary sanctions to $925.00,
representing five hours of work at an hourly rate of $185.00, as Plaintiff did
not file an opposition.
 
Special Interrogatories, Set One
 
Defendants request monetary sanctions in the
amount of $1,591.00 for their motion to compel Plaintiff’s further responses to
Special Interrogatories, Set One, representing 8.6 hours of work at an hourly
rate of $185.00 (Marchi Decl. ¶¶ 16-19.) The Court reduces monetary sanctions
to $1,295.00, representing seven hours of work at an hourly rate of $185.00, as
Plaintiff did not file an opposition.
 
Request for Production of Documents, Set One
 
Defendants request monetary sanctions in the
amount of $2,201.50 for their motion to compel Plaintiff’s further responses to
Request for Production of Documents, Set One, representing 11.9 hours of work
at an hourly rate of $185.00 (Marchi Decl. ¶¶ 16-19.) The Court reduces
monetary sanctions to $1,295.00, representing seven hours of work at an hourly
rate of $185.00, seeing as Plaintiff did not file an opposition and the motion
is largely identical to Defendants’ other motions to compel further.
 
Total Sanctions
 
Pursuant to CCP § 2023.050, Defendants also
request sanctions in the amount of $1,000.00 since Plaintiff delayed discovery
responses for 106 days before serving boilerplate objections to Defendants’
Discovery Motions in their entirety. (Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Further
Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, Marchi Decl. ¶ 19.) 
 
CCP § 2023.050 provides, in pertinent part,
that “a court shall impose a one-thousand dollar ($1,000) sanction, payable to
the requesting party, upon a party, person, or attorney if, upon reviewing a
request for sanction made pursuant to Section 2023.040, the court finds any of
the following: (1) The party, person, or attorney did not respond in good faith
to a request for the production of documents made pursuant to Section 2020.010,
2020.410, 2020.510, or 2025.210, or to an inspection demand made pursuant to
Section 2031.010.” (CCP § 2023.050(a)(1).)
 
Here, Plaintiff did not respond in good faith
to Defendants’ request for production of documents and inspection demand made
pursuant to CCP § 2031.010. Therefore, the Court grants Defendants’ request for
sanctions in the amount of $1,000.00 pursuant to CCP § 2023.050.
 
In total, for Plaintiff’s failure to
substantively respond to Defendants’ Discovery Motions, Plaintiff and
Plaintiff’s counsel, jointly and severally, is ordered to pay defense counsel
sanctions in the sum amount of $5,540.00.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Based on the foregoing, Defendants’ Discovery Motions are
GRANTED.
 
The Court ORDERS that Plaintiff provides verified, complete
and code-compliant responses, without objections, to Defendant’s Form
Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for
Production of Documents, Set One, in their entirety, within 20 days of this
hearing. 
 
Additionally, Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel, jointly
and severally, are ordered to pay $5,540.00 in monetary sanctions to defense
counsel within 20 days of this hearing.
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
