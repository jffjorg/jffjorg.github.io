And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Todd B. Becker, Esq. for Plaintiff Haoxian Lai. The motion is granted due to an irreconcilable breakdown of the attorney-client relationship and the potential for Counsel to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct or the State Bar Act by continuing to represent the Plaintiff. The judge finds that the Plaintiff will not be prejudiced by Counsel's relief, as they have adequate time to find alternative representation. The effective date of the order relieving Counsel is set for proof of service of the signed order being filed with the court.
