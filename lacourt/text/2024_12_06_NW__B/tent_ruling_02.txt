BACKGROUND
 
This action
arises from the alleged February 2020 assault of Plaintiff Haoxian Lai
(“Plaintiff”) by Defendant Ip Shun Lee (“Lee”). On February 18, 2022, Plaintiff
brought suit against Defendants Lee, Fung Ying Yeung (“Yeung”), Ka Sing Chiang
(“Chiang”),  and Does 1 to 50
(collectively “Defendants”) alleging three causes of action: (1) premises
liability; (1) intentional tort (as to Lee); (2) general negligence (as to
Yeung and Chiang); and (3) premises liability (as to Yeung and Chiang.)
 
On
June 6, 2024, this action was reassigned to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in
Department B at Van Nuys Courthouse East, effective June 24, 2024. 
 
On November
7, 2024, Todd B. Becker, Esq. (“Counsel”) filed the instant unopposed Motion to
be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff.
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
The Court GRANTS the Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel filed by Todd B. Becker, Esq.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
The
court may order that an attorney be changed or substituted at any time before
or after judgment or final determination upon request by either client or
attorney and after notice from one to the other. (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §
284(2).) “The determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as
counsel lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi
& Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128,
1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as
counsel must be made on Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and
Motion) (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (CRC Rule
3.1362(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (CRC Rule 3.1362(e)).  The
proposed order must specify all hearing dates scheduled in the action or
proceeding, including the date of trial, if known. (CRC Rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Further, the requisite forms must be
served on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the
case. (CRC Rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay the effective date of
the order relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed
order on the client has been filed with the court. (CRC Rule
3.1362(e).) The Court has discretion on whether to allow an attorney to
withdraw, and a motion to withdraw will not be granted where withdrawal would
prejudice the client. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904,
915.)  

 
DISCUSSION
Counsel declares that there has been
an irreconcilable breakdown of the attorney-client relationship. (MC-052 Item
2.) Counsel also represents that continued representation of Plaintiff may
cause Counsel to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct or the State Bar
Act. (Ibid.)
Counsel has filed and served Plaintiff
with the required documents under CRC Rule 3.1362. Plaintif will not be
prejudiced by Counsel’s relief as they have adequate time to find alternative
representation. Therefore, Counsel’s motion to be relieved is granted.
CONCLUSION
 
The Court GRANTS the Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel filed by Todd B. Becker, Esq., effective upon proof of
service of the signed Order being filed with the court.  
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice. 
Cout to sign the proposed order.
