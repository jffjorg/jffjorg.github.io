And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling in the case of Swayze v. Daniells, case number 22SMCV01819, denies the defendant's motion to compel the deposition of the plaintiff and seek sanctions. The defendant had moved to depose the plaintiff, but the plaintiff had postponed the deposition twice due to COVID and childcare issues. On the agreed-upon date of December 19, 2023, the plaintiff appeared remotely via cell phone camera for the deposition, but the defendant's counsel refused to proceed due to the plaintiff's remote appearance. The judge notes that the defendant did not explain why the plaintiff's use of a cell phone made it impossible to conduct the deposition, and that there is no evidence of bad faith. The parties are ordered to present an agreed-upon date for the deposition to proceed within 30 days at the hearing of this motion.
