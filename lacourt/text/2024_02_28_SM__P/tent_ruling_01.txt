Swayze v.
Daniells, Case No. 22SMCV01819
Hearing Date
February 28, 2024
Defendant
Daniells’ Motion to Compel Deposition of Plaintiff and for Sanctions
 
In this auto
accident case defendant seeks to depose plaintiff. Defendant moved the
deposition once. Plaintiff then postponed twice, once due to COVID and once due
to childcare issues. The parties had an IDC, at which they agreed to take the
depo December 19, 2023. That day, plaintiff appeared remotely via cell phone
camera. Defendant’s counsel refused to proceed; the notice specified appearance
via laptop or desktop computer. See Morovati decl., Exhibit G, H “[t]he
use of a smartphone to conduct the deposition is not permitted.” Defendant
moves to compel Swayze’s deposition and seeks sanctions.
 
Cal. Code of Civ.
Proc. §2025.450(a) states if a party fails to appear for a noticed deposition without
serving valid objections, the serving party can move to compel the deponent’s
attendance and testimony.
 
Swayze appeared for
deposition on December 19. Daniells does not explain why her use of a cell
phone made it impossible to conduct the deposition. There is no bad faith;
plaintiff postponed twice, then appeared via cell phone. Defendant postponed
once. 
 
The motion is
DENIED. The parties are to present the court with an agreed-upon date for the
deposition to proceed within 30 days at the hearing of this motion.
