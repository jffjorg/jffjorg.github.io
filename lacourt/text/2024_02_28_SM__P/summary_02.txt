And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Jane Doe v. Edward Bass Films et al. The defendant, Edward Bass, has filed a demurrer to the first amended complaint (FAC) alleging that the complaint is uncertain. The judge agrees that the complaint is uncertain and sustains the demurrer with a 10-day leave to amend. The judge rules that the plaintiff must amend the complaint to include specific factual allegations for each cause of action, rather than conclusory statements. The judge also denies the defendant's request for judicial notice of certain documents and allegations, as they are not relevant to the demurrer and do not provide a basis for judicial notice.
