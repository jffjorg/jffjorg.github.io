And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions in limine filed by the plaintiff and defendant. The plaintiff's motion seeks to bar Honda from presenting evidence of its dispute resolution program, which is not certified by the Department of Consumer Affairs. The judge denies this motion, finding that Honda's program may still offer a safe harbor from non-willful civil penalties, and that the burden of establishing noncompliance rests with the plaintiff, not the defendant.

The judge also rules on the relevance and admissibility of evidence concerning defects or nonconformities that were repaired on a single presentation. Honda argues that the plaintiff's theory of liability impermissibly aggregates minor and allegedly repaired concerns to create a claim. The judge agrees with Honda, finding that the plaintiff's approach would essentially require a manufacturer to guarantee defect-free products, which is not the intention of the Song-Beverly Act. The judge grants Honda's motion and denies the plaintiff's motion on this issue.
