English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies the Motion to Set Aside and/or Vacate Judgment filed by the Defendant, Mohamed Aboselim. The Court finds that the Motion was untimely filed, as it was filed on December 21, 2023, after the 180-day deadline to file such a motion. Even if the Court had reached the merits of the Motion, the Court would still deny it, as the Defendant failed to appear at trial and waived his arguments about fraud and abuse of process. The Court also finds that the evidence submitted by the Defendant is insufficient to show that fraud or abuse of process occurred.
