And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to Requests for Production, Set One, with respect to RFPs 39, 40, 44, 45, 48, and 50. The defendant, Care Unlimited Health Services, Inc., failed to provide sufficient responses to these requests, and the court finds that they are relevant to the case. The court has ordered the defendant to provide further verified responses without objection (if applicable) and responsive documents within twenty (20) days of the date of the ruling.

The court has also awarded the plaintiff sanctions in the amount of $1,500, to be paid by the defendant and its counsel jointly. The court finds that the defendant's failure to provide timely and sufficient responses to the requests for production was unreasonable and warrants the imposition of sanctions.

The court's ruling is based on the Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.310, 2016.040, 2017.010, and 2031.240(c)(1), as well as previous cases such as Gonzalez v. Sup.Ct. (1995) 33 CA4th 1539, 1546; Lipton v. Sup.Ct. (1996) 48 CA4th 1599, 1611; Stewart v. Colonial Western Agency, Inc. (2001) 87 CA4th 1006, 1013; Obregon v.
