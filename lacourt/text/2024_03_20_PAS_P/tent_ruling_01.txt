[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER GRANTING IN PART PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO
  REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION FROM DEFENDANT CARE UNLIMITED
 
Date: March 20, 2024
Time:  8:30 a.m.
Dept.:  P



 
          I.
       INTRODUCTION
          This case concerns the death
of Victor Lucchesi, who died at the age of 75 while a resident of skilled
nursing facility (SNF) Care Unlimited Health Services (Care Unlimited). His
daughter, Debra L. Bachman, sues individually and as trustee of the trust set
up by her parents. She alleges that her father suffered from Parkinson’s
disease, suffered a stroke in 2018, and required full care. Care Unlimited
provided care for Mr. Lucchesi from 2020 until his death in 2022. Bachman
alleges that the care her father received was inadequate, as the nurses were
not properly trained, her father had several setbacks, and his medication was
not properly or promptly administered. 
          The complaint contains seven causes of
action: (1) elder neglect, (2) negligence, (3) wrongful death, (4) negligent
hiring and supervision, (5) violation of consumer legal remedies act, (6) intentional
misrepresentation and (7) negligent misrepresentation. 
Plaintiff filed the instant motion to compel further
responses on October 27, 2023 as to Requests for Production, Set One. Plaintiff
filed a notice that no opposition was received on March 11, 2024. Two hours
later, also on March 11, 2024, Counsel for Defendants filed a declaration
attempting to address the status of Defendants’ responses. 
At issue is the sufficiency of Care Unlimited’s compliance
with Requests for Production Nos.  2, 11,
21, 23-27, 39, 40, 44-46, and 48-50 propounded as Requests for Production, Set
One on April 13, 2023. For the reasons that follow, the motion is granted in
part.  
 
II.       LEGAL
STANDARD
          A party
responding to requests for inspection must either provide a statement of
compliance, represent that it lacks the ability to comply, or object. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2031.210.) When a party propounding demands for inspection deems
responses to the responses to be incomplete or evasive, or deems objections to
be without merit, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
further responses. Such a motion must set forth facts showing good cause for
the discovery, be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration, and include a
separate statement. The motion must also be made within 45 days of verified
responses or supplemental responses, or on or before any specific later date
the parties have agreed to in writing. (Code Civ. Proc. §2031.310(a)-(c).)
          Code Civ. Proc. Section 2031.310(h) provides for the
imposition of monetary sanctions against any party who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes such a motion unless the court finds that the one subject to sanction
acted with substantial justification, or that other circumstances make the
imposition of sanctions unjust.
 
III.     ANALYSIS
          A. Meet and Confer
Code
Civ. Proc. §2031.310(b) mandates that a motion to compel further responses be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040. Code Civ.
Proc. §2016.040 details what this requirement entails: “A meet and confer
declaration in support of a motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and
good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the
motion.”
Counsel
for Plaintiff, Rewa Ousman, declares that after receiving Defendant Care
Unlimited’s response on May 31, 2023, she sent a meet and confer letter on July
7, 2023. (Ousman Decl. ¶ 7, Exh. E.) Counsel then met telephonically on July
19, 2023.  They agreed that the deadline
to file a motion to compel further responses was extended, and the deficiencies
in the responses were discussed. (Ousman Decl. ¶ 8.)  
Ousman
then provided clarification as to what documents Plaintiff was seeking, via an
email sent on July 28, 2023. She received no response. (Ousman Decl. ¶ 9, Exh.
G.) Plaintiff’s counsel granted several extensions in which to provide
supplemental responses to the discovery requests. (Ousman Decl. ¶¶ 10-17.) On
October 13, 2023, the date of the last extension, no supplementals were
received. (Ousman Decl. ¶ 18.) Defendant’s counsel emailed on October 17 that
he would send the supplementals by October 19, 2023. (Ousman Decl. ¶ 19.)
Supplementals were provided October 19, 2023. (Ousman Decl. ¶ 20.)
Ousman
declares that the October 19, 2023 production had no documents attached, and
several documents counsel had discussed were not provided. (Ousman Decl. ¶ 21.)
Defendant’s counsel responded by providing a link to the documents; but he did
not clarify regarding the missing documents that counsel had discussed
(personnel records). (Ousman Decl. ¶ 22, Exh. R.) Ousman then filed this motion
to compel.
Ousman’s
declaration is sufficient for meet and confer purposes.

          C. Analysis 
          i. Relevance
Code
Civ. Proc. Section 2017.010 permits a party to “obtain discovery regarding any
matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter . . . if the
matter is either itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated
to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (CCP § 2017.010.) According
to a leading treatise, “For discovery purposes, information should be regarded
as ‘relevant’ to the subject matter if it might reasonably assist a party in evaluating
the case, preparing for trial, or facilitating settlement. (Gonzalez
v. Sup.Ct.  (1995) 33 CA4th 1539,
1546 (citing text); Lipton v. Sup.Ct. (1996) 48 CA4th 1599, 1611 (citing
text); Stewart v. Colonial Western Agency, Inc. (2001) 87 CA4th 1006,
1013 (citing text)]” (Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure
Before Trial (The Rutter Group June 2022), ¶8:66.1.) 
As Plaintiff
notes, the scope of discovery is broad by design. (Memorandum of Points and
Authorities p.14: 21, p. 18:1-2.) The discovery requests here seek information regarding
Care Unlimited’s policies and procedures as they relate to the specific care
Victor Lucchesi received; reports to the California Department of Public Health
(which oversees and certifies SNFs); and personnel files of people who cared
for Mr. Lucchesi, among others. This information is relevant to Plaintiff’s
causes of action arising out of the care Defendant provided to Mr. Lucchesi,
under the broad and narrow definition of relevance.
Accordingly,
the information sought by the discovery requests at issue is relevant. The
relevancy objection is overruled.
 
 
          ii. Impropriety of Defendant’s Responses
In
his motion, Bachman’s counsel urges that a number of Defendant’s responses are
improper, specifically RFPs Nos. 2, 11, 21, 23-27 and 46. (Memorandum of Points
and Authorities p. 9: 10-11.) Specifically, she urges that boilerplate
objections are not proper and that statements of compliance are required. (Id.)
These arguments are well-taken. (See CCP § 2031.220; Korea Data Sys. Co. v.
Super. Ct. (1997) 51 Cal.App.4th 1513, 1517; West Pico Furniture Co. of
L.A. (1961) 56 Cal.2d 407, 417.) Care Unlimited’s responses fail to list all
the documents in their possession that meet the discovery request criteria. (Memorandum
of Points and Authorities p. 11: 13- p. 13:13.)
          Additionally, Bachman argues that Care
Unlimited’s responses to RFP 21, 23 and 46 are non-complaint, as Care Unlimited
responded that it would provide “all relevant nonprivileged items responsive to
the request that is in its possession, custody and control” and this
qualification does not comport with CCP Section 2031.220. (Memorandum of Points
and Authorities p.10: 3-4.) Bachman urges that this response leaves open the
possibility that other documents exist that Care Unlimited has decided are
irrelevant or privileged. The Court agrees, and orders Care Unlimited to
produce a privilege log to the extent that the privilege objection is still
being asserted. As discussed above, all of the RFPs are relevant.
          To the extent that Care Unlimited is still asserting objections
as to overbreadth, burden, oppression and harassment, the Court notes that the
standard for overbreadth is to be ambiguous to the point of being
unintelligible, which is not met here. (Obregon v. Superior Court (1998)
67 Cal.App.4th 424, 431.) Additionally, the statement of ‘burden’ alone is not
enough to assert an overly burdensome objection to production. (West Pico
Furniture Co. of L.A. (1961) 56 Cal.2d 407, 417.) To the extent that Care
Unlimited believes the requests to be requesting information outside of the
scope of the lawsuit, the Court encourages parties to meet and confer further on
this point of contention. 
          Care Unlimited is still apparently asserting a privacy
objection to RFPs 39 and 40.   Bachman urges that Care Unlimited, as the
party asserting the privacy objection, must first establish that the
information sought is indeed private and do the interest balancing. Bachman
urges that personnel information as to who undertook her father’s care is not
protected by privacy interest as these employees may be possible witnesses to
the causes of action. (Memorandum of Points and Authorities p.13: 14-15.) Bachman
urges that private information of these employees, such as social security
numbers and other personal information, may be redacted from the files. (See
Lopez v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246
Cal.App.4th 566, 598.)
          Care Unlimited also asserted several objections that apply
to the admissibility of evidence, which is not applicable at the discovery
phase. (See EC § 1101 [character evidence], EC § 1151 [subsequent remedial
measures], Memorandum of Points and Authorities p. 19: 22- p. 21: 25.)
Accordingly, these objections are overruled.
Lastly,
to the extent that the Court considers the possibility that Defendant is still
asserting attorney-client or work product privilege valid objections to RFP 49,
the Court agrees with Bachman that Defendant needs to produce a privilege log.
(See CCP § 2031.240(c)(1), Memorandum of Points and Authorities p.22: 1-10.)
Defendant
did not file a timely opposition to the motion to compel.  Instead, Care Unlimited’s counsel Fang Li
filed a declaration on March 11, 2024. In it, he declares that he was engaged
in trial in San Diego when the opposition was due. (Li Decl. ¶ 3.) He declares
that the opposition due date was not properly calendared “for some reason.” (Li
Decl. ¶¶ 2,3.) He insists that half of RFPs at issue were answered fully,
either by the initial May 31, 2023 production or the supplemental October 19,
2023 production. (Li Decl. ¶¶ 5-19.) Specifically, Li urges that RFPs 2, 11, 23,
24, 25, 26, 27, 46, 49 were answered completely, and that Care Unlimited is not
withholding any documents in response to these discovery requests. He signs
this declaration under penalty of perjury.
However,
with respect to RFPs 39, 40, 44, 45, 48 and 50, Li urges “Care Unlimited
intends to produce these records prior to the hearing on March 20, 2024.” (Li
Decl. ¶¶ 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20.) The Court notes that there is nothing filed
with the Court by either side indicating that Care Unlimited served these
supplemental records.
Accordingly,
the Court compels a further response to RFPs 39 ,40 ,44 ,45, 48 and 50.
D.
Sanctions
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.310, subdivision (h) and 2030.300 subdivision (d), requires the
imposition of sanctions against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further response unless
the court finds the imposition of a sanction to be unjust or that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification. 
Bachman
asks for monetary sanctions against Defendant Care Unlimited in connection with
making the motion. In support, Bachman provides the
declaration of her attorney, Rewa Ousman. (Ousman Declaration.) Ousman declares
that her hourly rate is $350. (Ousman Decl. ¶ 25.) She declares that she has
spent 12 hours on the motion and anticipates spending 2 hours preparing for and
appearing at the hearing. She spent $60.00 on the filing fee. Accordingly, the
total expenses incurred are $4,960. However, Plaintiff only requests a monetary
sanction of $1,500.
The
Court finds that the amount of sanctions requested by Plaintiff is reasonable. The
Court finds that the hourly rate is reasonable. 
Accordingly,
the Court awards total sanctions of $1,500.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
V.       CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
          Plaintiff Bachman’s
motion to compel further responses to Requests for Production, Set One is GRANTED
with respect to RFPs 39, 40, 44, 45, 48 and 50.  Further verified responses
without objection (if applicable) and responsive documents are to be served and
produced within twenty (20) days of today’s date.
The associated request for sanctions is GRANTED
against Care Unlimited and its counsel jointly in the amount of $1,500. 
Sanctions are to be paid to Plaintiff within thirty (30) days of today’s
date.   
Bachman is ordered to give notice.
