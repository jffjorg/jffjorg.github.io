And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to grant the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Attorney Ronnivashti Whitehead on behalf of Christina Aragon. The motion was filed due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, which has made it impossible for the attorney to continue representing the client. The judge has found that granting the motion is appropriate because no prejudice to the client is anticipated. The judge has ordered the attorney to provide notice to the client and the parties.
