And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling in a wrongful death case where the defendant, Josh Adam Klinghoffer, is seeking to stay the civil proceedings pending the outcome of his criminal charges for vehicular manslaughter. The plaintiff, Ashley Sanchez, argues that staying proceedings would hinder discovery and delay the lawsuit. The court considers the Avant! factors, including the interests of the parties, the convenience of the court, and the interests of the public. The court finds that staying discovery directed at the defendant pending the final determination of the criminal action is appropriate to safeguard the defendant's Fifth Amendment rights. The court grants the motion to stay in part, but declines to stay all proceedings.
