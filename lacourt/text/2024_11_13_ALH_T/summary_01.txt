And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to grant the defendant's motion to bifurcate the trial in this personal injury case. The case arises from injuries sustained by the plaintiff when they were struck in the head by a hose during a house fire. The defendant argues that bifurcation would promote economy, efficiency, and the ends of justice, particularly by allowing the court to address the issue of its immunity from liability separately and first. The plaintiff agrees with the defendant on bifurcation and the court finds that it is appropriate to grant the motion. The court concludes that bifurcation would allow for a more efficient trial process, avoid wasting court time, and promote settlement of the remaining issues.
