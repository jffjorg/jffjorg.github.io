And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the motion to strike the request for punitive/exemplary damages and treble damages under Civil Code section 3346 from the complaint filed by Plaintiffs Boris and Janetta Chernega against Defendants Armen and Karine Gasparian. The judge has granted the motion in part, striking the request for punitive damages, but denied it in part, allowing the Plaintiffs to plead treble damages. The judge found that the complaint failed to allege specific facts to support the elements of punitive damages, and that the Plaintiffs' contention is based on inference, not specific fact pleading. The judge also found that the Defendants failed to provide legal authority to support their contention that intent is a pleading element of treble damages under Civil Code section 3346.
