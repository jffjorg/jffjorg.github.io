And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is ruling on motions for protective orders filed by Kasra and Nasser Mizban regarding special interrogatories and requests for admission propounded by Gabriel Sanchez. The judge denies the motions, finding that Kasra and Nasser have not shown good cause for a protective order.

Regarding the special interrogatories, the judge finds that Gabriel Sanchez has shown good cause for Kasra to answer the interrogatories, which are reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The judge also finds that the interrogatories are not excessive or overly burdensome to answer.

Regarding the requests for admission, the judge finds that Nasser has not shown good cause for a protective order because he has not shown that the RFAs are burdensome to answer, duplicative of other discovery, or propounded for the purpose of harassment. The judge also finds that Nasser has already served responses to the RFAs and that the pending claims are not dependent on Kasra's competence or fitness to drive, or Nasser's awareness of the same.
