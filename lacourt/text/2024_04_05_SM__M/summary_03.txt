And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's motion to compel the Defendant's deposition and production of documents. The Defendant, Daryll Robertson, failed to appear at his scheduled deposition on January 29, 2024, despite being properly served with a deposition notice and attempts by the deposition officer to contact him. The Plaintiff's counsel also mailed the Defendant a letter providing the deposition Zoom link and contact information. As a result, the motion is granted, and the Defendant is ordered to appear at his deposition and produce documents as noticed within 10 days. Sanctions of $1,200.00, inclusive of costs, are also imposed against the Defendant, to be paid within 30 days.
