And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Singer v. Related Cal. Urban Housing, et al. (Case No. 19SMCV01614). The motion, filed by Plaintiff Singer, seeks to compel further responses to a deposition subpoena served on non-party deponent Related Management Company, L.P. The subpoena requested production of six categories of documents related to the curtain wall and window systems at The Waverly.

The judge finds that Related Management's response and production were insufficient. Specifically, the company failed to provide the required affidavit as part of their production, and the produced documents were incomplete. The judge notes that Plaintiff's counsel has demonstrated that responsive documents must exist, given the extensive communications between Related Management and various parties about the water intrusion issues.

Accordingly, the judge grants the motion and orders further responses to be produced within 10 days.
