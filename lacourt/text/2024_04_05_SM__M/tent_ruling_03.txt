Properties LLC, v. Robertson, et al.
CASE NO.:                22SMCV01065
MOTION:                  Motion
to Compel the Defendant’s Deposition
HEARING DATE:   4/5/2024

 
Legal
Standard
 
Service of a proper deposition
notice obligates a party or “party-affiliated” witness (officer, director,
managing agent or employee of party) to attend and testify, as well as produce
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing for
inspection and copying. (CCP § 2025.280(a).) If, after service of a deposition
notice, a party deponent fails to appear, testify, or produce documents or
tangible things for inspection without having served a valid objection under
CCP § 2025.410, the deposing party may move for an order compelling attendance,
testimony, and production. (CCP § 2025.450(a).) The motion must be accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration, or, when a party deponent fails to attend the
deposition, the motion must also be accompanied by a declaration stating that
the moving party has contacted the party deponent to inquire about the
nonappearance. (CCP § 2025.450(b)(2).) 
 
A motion to compel production
of documents described in a deposition notice must be accompanied by a showing
of good cause. (CCP § 2025.450(b)(1).) In other words, the moving party must
provide evidence (generally in the form of declarations) showing specific facts
justifying inspection of the documents described in the notice. Courts
liberally construe good cause in favor of discovery where facts show the
documents are necessary for trial preparation.
 
The motion to compel must be
“made no later than 60 days after the completion of the record of the
deposition.” (CCP § 2025.480(b).) This time limit also applies to motions based
on a deposition subpoena for production of documents or a business records subpoena.
The 60-day time limit runs from the date objections are served because the
deposition record is then complete. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co.
(2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1164, 1192.) 
 
Analysis
 
Plaintiff DM Properties LLC moves
to compel the deposition of Defendant Daryll Robertson along with the
associated production of documents. Plaintiff served Defendant with a notice of
deposition, and Defendant subsequently failed to appear on January 29, 2024. (Kakoian
Decl. ¶2, Ex. A.) 
 
Prior to the deposition, Plaintiff's
counsel worked with the deposition officer, Jorge Fernandez of
Atkinson-Baker/Veritext, to provide Defendant with the deposition Zoom link.
(Kakoian Decl., ¶ 3.) On January 4, 2024, Mr. Fernandez attempted to contact
Defendant by phone to obtain his email address but had to leave a message.
(Id., ¶4, Ex. B) On January 23, 2024, Plaintiff's counsel mailed Defendant a
letter providing the deposition Zoom link and Mr. Fernandez's contact
information in case Defendant preferred to receive the link by email. (Id., ¶5,
Ex. C.) On January 29, 2024, Defendant failed to appear for his properly
noticed deposition. (Id., ¶ 6.) Plaintiff's counsel and other parties waited
until 10:17 a.m. before concluding the deposition due to Defendant's
non-appearance. (Id., ex. D.) Defendant has also failed to produce any
documents responsive to the request for production attached to the deposition
notice. (Id., ¶7.)
 
Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED.
Defendant is ordered to appear at his deposition and produce documents as
noticed within 10 days. Sanctions are imposed in the noticed amount of
$1,200.00, inclusive of costs, against Defendant. Sanctions are to be paid within
30 days.
