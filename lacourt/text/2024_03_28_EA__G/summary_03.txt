And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Hong Jun Wang, has filed an ex parte application for the entry of judgment pursuant to a stipulated settlement agreement. The settlement agreement was entered into on September 26, 2023, and was between Wang, Junming Zeng, and Southwestern Saint Paul University (SSPU). The agreement required Zeng and SSPU to pay Wang $100,000 by January 1, 2024. However, Zeng failed to make the payment, and Wang's counsel sent a notice of default on January 2, 2024. Since Zeng and SSPU failed to make the payment, Wang is entitled to the entry of judgment against them in the amount of $100,000, plus costs of $660. The court grants Wang's ex parte application and orders the entry of judgment in the amount of $101,320.
