for Default Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Ally Bank’s Application
for Default Judgment is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
This
is a collections action. In January 2023, Defendant Yolanda Escobar purchased a
used 2020 Toyota Camry from Envision WC CDJR Auto LLC (Envision) pursuant to a
retail installment sales contract. Subsequently, Envision assigned its interest
in the retail installment sales contract to Plaintiff Ally Bank. In February
2023, Ally Bank alleges Escobar failed to make payments that were due and
currently owes an outstanding balance of $31,958.93.
On
September 15, 2023, Ally Bank filed a complaint against Escobar and Does 1-10,
alleging the following causes of action: (1) claim and delivery of personal
property and (2) money due. On November 14, Ally Bank’s process server
personally served Escobar in Los Angeles.
On
December 26, 2023, Ally Bank filed an application for a writ of possession. On
March 7, 2024, default was entered against Escobar and Ally Bank submitted the
present application for default judgment.
A
hearing on Ally Bank’s application for a writ of possession is set for March
28, 2024, along with a case management conference.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
Ally
Bank seeks default judgment against Escobar in the amount of $31,958.93 in
damages. Because the court finds Ally Bank has submitted sufficient evidence,
the court GRANTS their application for default judgment.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Ally
Bank’s application for default judgment is GRANTED.
