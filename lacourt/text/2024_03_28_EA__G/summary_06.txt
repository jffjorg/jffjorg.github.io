Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Associated Pomona Teachers (APT) to the complaint filed by Pomona Unified School District (PUSD). The court has stayed the present action pending the resolution of PUSD's breach of contract claims before the Public Employment Relations Board (PERB). The court finds that APT's alleged refusal to reimburse PUSD for release time costs could constitute an unfair practice under the Educational Employment Relations Act (EERA) and therefore, the PERB has jurisdiction over the matter. The court will sustain APT's demurrer and grant PUSD leave to amend the Complaint with allegations regarding its claims before the PERB.
