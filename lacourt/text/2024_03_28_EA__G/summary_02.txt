And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling in a lemon law action case (23PSCV00321) between Elizabeth Turriaga, the plaintiff, and General Motors, LLC, the defendant. The case involves a 2017 Cadillac CTS purchased by Turriaga in 2018, which allegedly exhibited transmission defects. The defendant filed a demurrer and motion to strike, arguing that the plaintiff's complaint does not state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action. The court ruled that the defendant's demurrer is sustained in part, with leave to amend, as to the fifth cause of action for concealment, and overruled as moot as to all other causes of action. The court also deemed the motion to strike punitive damages moot. The plaintiff's First Amended Complaint alleged breach of express warranty, breach of implied warranty, concealment, and violations of the Consumer Legal Remedies Act and the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act. The court found that the plaintiff's concealment claim was insufficiently pled and granted the defendant 10 days to amend.
