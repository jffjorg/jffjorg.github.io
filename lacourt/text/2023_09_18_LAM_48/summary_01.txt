And here is the English summary:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents. The defendant had propounded three requests: (1) all communications between the plaintiff and any person about COVID-19 in 2020, (2) all communications between the plaintiff and any health care provider about COVID-19 in 2020, and (3) all documents reflecting any investigation the plaintiff conducted in 2020 about COVID-19. The court finds that these requests are overbroad and burdensome, and that the defendant has not shown good cause to justify the discovery sought. The motion is denied for all three requests. The parties are required to send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit on the tentative ruling, and if all parties submit, no appearances before the court are required unless there is a companion hearing.
