(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a))
  - "Responsive documents would include information from March 4, 2020, when Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in California, to December 31, 2020, and whether (for instance) [Plaintiff] educated himself on the municipal, county, state or federal guidelines to quarantine and return to the workplace."

And here is the English summary:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents. The defendant had propounded three requests: (1) all communications between the plaintiff and any person about COVID-19 in 2020, (2) all communications between the plaintiff and any health care provider about COVID-19 in 2020, and (3) all documents reflecting any investigation the plaintiff conducted in 2020 about COVID-19. The court finds that these requests are overbroad and burdensome, and that the defendant has not shown good cause to justify the discovery sought. The motion is denied for all three requests. The parties are required to send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit on the tentative ruling, and if all parties submit, no appearances before the court are required unless there is a companion hearing.

## English Summary

The judge has denied Defendant Santa Clarita Studios Corp.'s motion to compel further responses to three specific requests for documents (RFPs) from Plaintiff Oscar Valle. The judge found that the RFPs were overly broad and could potentially encompass a large amount of irrelevant information, including private medical records and daily communications about COVID-19 during the pandemic.

Defendant argued that they needed this information to understand the extent of Plaintiff's alleged COVID-19 diagnosis and its impact on his ability to perform his job. However, the judge determined that the phrasing of the RFPs was too broad and could require Plaintiff to disclose information that is not relevant to the case.

**English Text Summary of the Tentative Ruling:**

Judge Thomas D. Long issued a tentative ruling *denying* Santa Clarita Studios Corp.'s motion to compel Oscar Valle to provide further responses to their Requests for Production (RFP) numbers 20, 21, and 22.  The RFPs all related to Valle's communications and investigations regarding COVID-19 in 2020. The judge found that all three requests, as originally written, were overly broad and burdensome.  While the Defendant attempted to narrow the scope of the requests in their motion, the judge ruled based on the original wording.  Specifically, RFP No. 20 asked for *all* communications about COVID-19 in 2020, which the judge deemed too broad given the widespread discussions about the pandemic. RFP No. 21 asked for all communications with healthcare providers about COVID-19 in 2020, which the judge found could include private medical records unrelated to the claimed disability. RFP No. 22 asked for all documents reflecting any investigation Valle conducted about COVID-19 in 2020, which the judge also found overly broad and burdensome, potentially encompassing a vast amount of information. The judge's tentative ruling is that the motion to compel is denied, and the Defendant must notify the other parties of the ruling. The parties can submit on the tentative ruling by email, and if all do so, no court appearance is required.
