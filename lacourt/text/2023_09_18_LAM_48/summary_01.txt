  - "Responsive documents would include information from March 4, 2020, when Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in California, to December 31, 2020, and whether (for instance) [Plaintiff] educated himself on the municipal, county, state or federal guidelines to quarantine and return to the workplace."

And here is the English summary:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents. The defendant had propounded three requests: (1) all communications between the plaintiff and any person about COVID-19 in 2020, (2) all communications between the plaintiff and any health care provider about COVID-19 in 2020, and (3) all documents reflecting any investigation the plaintiff conducted in 2020 about COVID-19. The court finds that these requests are overbroad and burdensome, and that the defendant has not shown good cause to justify the discovery sought. The motion is denied for all three requests. The parties are required to send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit on the tentative ruling, and if all parties submit, no appearances before the court are required unless there is a companion hearing.

## English Summary

The judge has denied Defendant Santa Clarita Studios Corp.'s motion to compel further responses to three specific requests for documents (RFPs) from Plaintiff Oscar Valle. The judge found that the RFPs were overly broad and could potentially encompass a large amount of irrelevant information, including private medical records and daily communications about COVID-19 during the pandemic.

Defendant argued that they needed this information to understand the extent of Plaintiff's alleged COVID-19 diagnosis and its impact on his ability to perform his job. However, the judge determined that the phrasing of the RFPs was too broad and could require Plaintiff to disclose information that is not relevant to the case.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents. The defendant had requested communications and documents related to COVID-19, but the judge found that the requests were overbroad and burdensome. The requests, as phrased, could include private medical records and communications from long before the plaintiff's diagnosis and alleged disability. The judge ruled that the requests were not tailored to the specific issues in the case and would impose an undue burden on the plaintiff. The motion is denied for RFP Nos. 20, 21, and 22.
