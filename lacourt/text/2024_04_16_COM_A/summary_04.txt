And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants in part and denies in part the Defendants' motion to strike portions of the Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint. The motion to strike the prayer for attorney's fees is denied. The motion to strike the prayer and related allegations for punitive damages is granted. The court strikes the paragraphs alleging punitive damages and related claims. The Plaintiffs' failure to allege an intent to injure and the lack of allegations supporting corporate ratification of the alleged conduct render the claims for punitive damages unsupported. The court denies leave to amend the complaint to cure the deficiencies in the allegations.
