And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a lawsuit arising from a two-vehicle accident. The defendant, Ardeshir Nejati, has moved to compel the plaintiffs, Coral Langarica, Jocelyn Ramon, and Samantha Ochoa, to respond to initial written discovery requests. The plaintiffs failed to file an opposition to the motions, and the defendant has requested that the court compel the plaintiffs to respond to the discovery requests. The court has granted the defendant's motions to compel the plaintiffs to respond to form and special interrogatories and request for production of documents. The court has denied the plaintiffs' motion for responses to requests for admission. The court has imposed sanctions of $480 each on the three plaintiffs and their counsel, jointly and severally, for their failure to respond to discovery requests. The court has ordered the plaintiffs to provide verified responses to the discovery requests within 10 days.
