And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion for imposition of monetary sanctions. The defendant, Wily Oris Barrios, contends that the 18th cause of action, alleging a denial of pre-move out inspection, is frivolous. The plaintiff, Evelin Quintero, alleges that the defendant breached a lease-to-buy agreement and failed to comply with statutory obligations. The plaintiff also alleges that the defendant's transfer of ownership of the property before the scheduled pre-move out inspection is invalid. The defendant argues that the court should take judicial notice of the recorded deed, which purportedly transfers ownership of the property, but the judge finds that the defendant's testimony and deposition evidence controvert the "legal effect" of the deed. The judge concludes that the defendant has not proffered evidence that the plaintiff asserted the 18th cause of action "primarily" for an improper purpose, such as to harass or cause unnecessary delay, and therefore denies the defendant's motion for imposition of monetary sanctions.
