 Case Number:  21STCV25909    Hearing Date:   February 7, 2024    Dept:  39 Lori Conn v. Tracy
Green, et al.
Case No.
21STCV25909
Motion to Compel
 
            The Court
posts this tentative order on Friday, February 2, 2024, in advance of the
hearing.  The Court provides notice: If
Tracy Green does not appear at the hearing, she shall waive the right to be
heard and the Court will issue this order. 

 
            Plaintiff
filed this legal malpractice action against Tracy Green, Esq. and her law firm,
Green & Associates, on July 14, 2021. Plaintiff alleged that “[she] had a
meritorious and valuable medical malpractice cause of action” against Dr. John
P. Beauclair, M.D., among others, but Ms. Green “negligently failed to file a
Complaint in the Superior Court of Los Angeles on behalf of Plaintiff within
the applicable statute of limitations.” Defendants were served via substituted
service, care of Ms. Green’s secretary, on July 27, 2021. No answer or
responsive pleading was filed, and a default judgment was entered on June 23,
2022. 
 
Plaintiff’s counsel noticed a
judgment debtor examination for April 7, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. The application and
order for appearance and examination was personally served upon Ms. Green on
February 28, 2023, but she did not appear at 8:30 a.m. as ordered by the Court.
The Court second-called the matter at 9:14 a.m., but Ms. Green still did not
appear. Nor did Ms. Green contact the Court’s clerk to alert him that she was
delayed in making her appearance. 
Therefore, the Court issued and held a bench warrant, and continued the
judgment debtor examination to May 22, 2023. 
The Court also issued an Order to Show Cause why the Court should not
refer Green to the California State Bar Association for failing to appear, as
ordered by the Court.
 
Green appeared on May 22, 2023, and
the judgment debtor examination proceeded. 
Green agreed to provide additional information, as noted in the
transcript of the examination, and the Court retained jurisdiction for this
reason.  On January 16, 2024, Plaintiff
filed a motion to compel Green to provide the additional information.  Plaintiff also seeks $10,000 in discovery
sanctions, as well as a bench warrant to require Ms. Green to appear and a
referral to the California State Bar Association.              
 
The Court orders as follows:
 
1.         The
Court grants the motion to compel and orders Tracy Green to provide the
additional information, as noted in the “blank” spaces in the transcript,
within thirty (30) days.
 
2.         The
Court denies the request for sanctions, as the request does not identify any
statutory basis for doing so.  
 
3.         The
Court denies the motion for a bench warrant and a referral to the California
State Bar Association without prejudice. 

 
4.         The
Court sets a compliance hearing for April 10, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.  The Court orders Plaintiff’s counsel to file
a status report on or before March 6, 2024, informing the Court whether Ms.
Green has complied with this order.  If
Green fails to comply with this order, absent good cause, the Court will
consider referring her to the California State Bar Association and/or contempt
proceedings, if appropriate.
 
5.         The
Court sets a non-appearance case review for March 11, 2024, at 1:30 p.m.  
 
6.         Plaintiff’s
counsel shall provide notice and file proof of such with the Court.
