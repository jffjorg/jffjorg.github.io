And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Tabibiazar v. Fadia, Case No. 23SMCV04829. The case involves a dispute between the plaintiff, Tabibiazar and Yahsar, and the defendants, Fadia, Nikamal, Arbabha, Pantoja, and House of Seven Gables Real Estate, regarding a retaining wall and the alleged growth of roots from the defendants' tree into the plaintiffs' property.

The court has sustained the plaintiff's demurrer to the second, third, and fourth causes of action (COAs) in Fadia's cross-complaint, finding that Fadia's allegations are insufficient to state a claim. The court has also granted the plaintiff's motion to strike Fadia's request for punitive damages, attorney's fees, and injunctive relief, finding that these requests lack legal support.

The court has overruled the defendants' demurrer to the twelfth and fourteenth COAs in the plaintiff's FAC, finding that the allegations are sufficient to state a claim. The court has also granted the plaintiff's motion to strike the defendants' request for declaratory relief, finding that the pleading does not set forth facts showing the existence of an actual controversy.

The court has ordered the moving parties to answer within 10 court days.
