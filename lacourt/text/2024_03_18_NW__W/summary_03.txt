And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is that the defendant's demurrer to the complaint is sustained with leave to amend, and the defendant's motion to strike is granted with leave to amend. The court ruled that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against the defendant, and that the plaintiff's allegations about the defendant's fiduciary duties are misstated. The court also ruled that the plaintiff's demand for punitive damages is alleged in conclusory fashion without any facts, let alone a factual showing of willful, malicious, fraudulent, oppressive or consciously indifferent conduct. The court granted the defendant 20 days to amend the complaint.
