And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the Plaintiffs' motion to compel further responses to their requests for production of documents. The Plaintiffs alleged that the Defendant, General Motors LLC, had failed to provide code-compliant discovery responses, specifically with regards to documents relating to policies and procedures for handling vehicle replacement and repurchase requests, and documents relating to the Defendant's vehicle repair and warranty codes issued for the subject vehicle.

The court found that the Defendant had failed to provide complete and adequate responses to the Plaintiffs' requests, and that the Plaintiffs had made a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of the issues presented in the motion.

The court ordered the Defendant to produce documents responsive to the Plaintiffs' requests, and to provide a privilege log if they believe any of the requested documents contain privileged or confidential information.

The Plaintiffs had also requested monetary sanctions against the Defendant and its counsel for the Defendant's failure to provide code-compliant discovery responses. However, the court denied the request for sanctions, finding that there was substantial justification for the Defendant's actions.
