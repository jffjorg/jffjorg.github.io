And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the complaint. The plaintiff, David Fassnacht, filed the original complaint on August 29, 2022, against defendants John Wordin, Life Aid Holdings, Inc., and Life Aid Research Institute, alleging fraudulent inducement, fraud, and breach of contract. The plaintiff seeks to amend the complaint to clarify potential ambiguities and insufficiencies, including clarifying the three agreements allegedly breached by defendants and pleading two new breach of contract causes of action that were inadvertently left out.

The Judge found that the plaintiff has fulfilled the requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324(a) and (b), and has submitted a supporting declaration that sets forth the effect of the amendment, why the amendment is necessary and proper, when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered, and why the request for amendment was not made earlier. The Judge granted the motion, allowing the plaintiff to file the first amended complaint.
