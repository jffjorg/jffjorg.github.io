And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for trial setting preference. The plaintiff, Eva Cruz, is over 70 years old and has a substantial interest in the action. However, the judge finds that the plaintiff's motion is insufficient because it lacks sufficient evidence to support a finding that her health necessitates trial preference to prevent prejudicing her interest in the litigation. The judge notes that the relevant standard under California Code of Civil Procedure section 36, subdivision (a) accommodates a wide range of circumstances, but the plaintiff's declaration fails to demonstrate any prejudice she would suffer if preference is unavailable. As a result, the judge has denied the motion.
