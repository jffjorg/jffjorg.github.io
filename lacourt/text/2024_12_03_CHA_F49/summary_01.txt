As for the summary text, here is a brief summary:

The judge has granted Ford Motor Company's motion for summary adjudication on the First, Fourth, and Seventh Causes of Action in the case. The First Cause of Action alleges that Ford Motor Company failed to provide a refund or replacement for a defective vehicle, but the judge finds that the vehicle does not qualify as a "new motor vehicle" under the Song-Beverly Act and therefore is not covered by the implied warranty. The Fourth Cause of Action alleges that Ford Motor Company breached the implied warranty of merchantability, but the judge finds that Ford Motor Company did not issue a new warranty at the time of the sale and therefore is not liable. The Seventh Cause of Action alleges that Ford Motor Company concealed the defects of the vehicle, but the judge finds that Ford Motor Company did not have a duty to disclose the information and therefore is not liable.
