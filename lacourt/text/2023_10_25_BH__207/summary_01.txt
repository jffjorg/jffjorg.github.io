And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to compel arbitration of the dispute between the parties. The judge finds that the arbitration provision in the engagement letter is valid and enforceable, and that the dispute is within the scope of the arbitration provision. The judge also finds that the arbitration provision is not procedurally unconscionable, despite the fact that the parties did not negotiate the terms of the engagement letter. The judge further finds that the provision's reference to the Judicate West arbitration rules does not create a "surprise" or "oppression" that would render the provision unconscionable. Finally, the judge finds that the plaintiff has not shown that the arbitration provision is substantively unconscionable, and that the defendant's motion to compel arbitration should be granted. The judge orders the action stayed pending the resolution of the parties' arbitration proceeding, and sets a status conference to monitor the progress of the arbitration.
