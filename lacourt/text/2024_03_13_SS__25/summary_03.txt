The court has reviewed the parties' stipulation and finds that it complies with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. The stipulation provides that the parties agreed to settle the matter for a principal sum of $10,184.11, with Defendant's insurance carrier making an initial payment of $7,184.11 by March 1, 2023. Defendant failed to make any monthly payments under the stipulation, putting him in default. The court finds that the settlement agreement is valid and enforceable, and that Plaintiff's motion to vacate dismissal and enter judgment is granted. Judgment is entered for Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of $3,500.00, which represents the principal amount of $10,184.11 less the payment made by Defendant's insurance carrier, plus court costs totaling $500.00.
