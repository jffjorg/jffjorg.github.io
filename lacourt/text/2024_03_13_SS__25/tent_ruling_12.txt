BACKGROUND
 
On August 11, 2023, Petitioner Richard Todd Sherman
(“Petitioner”) filed the instant Petition to Declare Mobile Home Abandoned
(“Petition”) against Respondents Robert M. Bloeser (“Respondent” or “Bloeser”)
and the Estate of Robert M. Bloeser (“Bloeser Estate”) (collectively
“Respondents”).  Pursuant to Civil Code § 798.61,
Petitioner seeks a declaration that the mobilehome located at 19120
Nordhoff St. 16 Dover, Northridge, CA 91324 described as a 1968 Hillcrest
mobilehome, Decal Number LBE1629, Serial No. 1225A and 1225B, Label/Insignia
Numbers A226191 and A226192 (“Mobilehome”) is abandoned. 
 
On September 19, 2023, Petitioner requested entry of
default against Respondent Bloeser. The Clerk entered default the same day. 
 
On December 13, 2023, the Court on its own motion
continued the hearing to January 29, 2024. 
 
On January 29, 2024, the Court on its own motion continued
the hearing to February 27, 2024, after noting several deficiencies with the Petition.
The Court ordered Petitioner to file supplemental briefings that address
whether the Mobilehome falls within the meaning of “abandoned” as defined by
Civil Code 798.61(a). Petitioner was also ordered to provide support for its
request for storage, attorney’s fees, and cost as well as provide a supporting
declaration and exhibits for the petition. 
 
On February 23, 2024, the Court granted Petitioner’s February
8, 2023, request for continuance of the hearing date to March 13, 2024. 
 
On February 21, 2024, Petitioner filed a supplemental
declaration in support of the Petition.
 
No opposition has been filed.

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard & Discussion 
As a general matter, the Court noted
several deficiencies with the instant petition in its prior order and ordered
Petitioner to file supplemental briefing addressing those deficiencies. Here,
Petitioner has filed a supplemental declaration from Catherine Woods which
addresses many of the issues previously noted. 
A.         Determination
of “Abandoned Mobilehome” —Civ. Code § 798.61(a)(1) 
 
Pursuant to Civil Code, section
798.61, subdivision (a)(1), an “‘abandoned mobilehome’ means a mobilehome about
which all of the following are true: 
 
(A) It is located in a mobilehome park on a site for which
no rent has been paid to the management for the preceding 60 days. 
 
(B) It is unoccupied. 
                                                                                                                                         
(C) A reasonable person would
believe it to be abandoned. 
 
(D) It is not permanently affixed
to the land.” 
 
(Civ. Code, §
798.61(a)(1)(A)-(D).)
 
Petitioner seeks a declaration that
the Mobilehome is abandoned. (Pet. p. 4.) The Petition alleges that the
Mobilehome is located at a mobilehome site for which no rent has been paid since
March 2022. (Id. ¶ 7.) Petitioner reasonably believes that the
mobilehome has been abandoned.” (Id.) 
 
Petitioner provides the Court with
a supplemental declaration of Northridge Mobile Home Park’s resident manager,
Catherine Woods. Ms. Woods declares that Respondent is the registered owner of
the Mobilehome located at 16 Dover, Northridge, CA 91324. (Catherine Woods Suppl.
Decl. ¶ 3; Exh. 1.) Pursuant to a written rental agreement, Respondents were
required to pay $790.00 in rent per month for the Mobilehome. (Id. ¶ 4;
Exh. 2.) The Mobilehome is not permanently affixed to the land on which it is
situated. (Id. ¶ 7.) Ms. Woods states that Respondent passed away around
February 2022. (Id. ¶ 5.)  Since
March 2022, Respondents have not paid rent for the Mobilehome. (Id. ¶ 6.)
Ms. Woods additionally states that a reasonable person would believe the Mobilehome
to be abandoned because since Respondent’s passing, no person has occupied the
Mobilehome nor is there any knowledge of any relatives or potential heirs.  (Id. ¶ 5.)
 
Here, the Court finds that based on
Petitioner’s supplemental declaration, Petitioner provides evidence that satisfies
the statutory definition of an “abandoned mobilehome”. Thus, the Petition satisfies
the requirements under Civil Code § 798.61(a).
 
B.         Notice of Belief of Abandonment—Civ.
Code § 798.61(b)
 
Civil
Code, section 798.61, subdivision (b) requires: 
 
After determining a mobilehome in a
mobilehome park to be an abandoned mobilehome, the management shall post a
notice of belief of abandonment on the mobilehome for not less than 30 days,
and shall deposit copies of the notice in the United States mail, postage
prepaid, addressed to the homeowner at the last known address and to any known
registered owner, if different from the homeowner, and to any known holder of a
security interest in the abandoned mobilehome. This notice shall be mailed by
registered or certified mail with a return receipt requested. 
 
(Civ. Code, §
798.61(b).)
 
On May 08, 2023, a 30-day Notice of Belief
of Abandonment was posted on the Mobilehome.  (Woods Suppl. Decl. ¶ 8, Ex.
4.)  On the same day, the Notice was mailed via certified mail, return
receipt requested, to Respondents at 19120 Nordhoff St. 16 Dover,
Northridge, CA 91324.  (05-08-23 Proofs of Service – Woods Decl. ¶ 8-9; Exh.
5.) 
 
Thus, the Court finds that Petitioner
has satisfied the requirements under § 798.61(b) with admissible evidence.
 
C.        Petition for Judicial Declaration—Civ. Code § 798.61(c) 
 
Civil Code section 798.61,
subdivision (c)(1) states that:
 
Thirty or more days following posting pursuant to
subdivision (b), the management may file a petition in the superior court in
the county in which the mobilehome park is located, for a judicial declaration
of abandonment of the mobilehome. A proceeding under this subdivision is a
limited civil case. Copies of the petition shall be served upon the homeowner,
any known registered owner, and any known person having a lien or security
interest of record in the mobilehome by posting a copy on the mobilehome and mailing
copies to those persons at their last known addresses by registered or
certified mail with a return receipt requested in the United States mail,
postage prepaid.
 
(Civ. Code, § 798.61(c).)

 
On August 11, 2023, more than 30 days
after posting and serving the Notice of Belief of Abandonment, Petitioner filed
the instant Petition. Petitioner has submitted proof of service indicating that Respondents were
served with a copy of the Petition by both certified mail and by posting on the
Mobilehome. (09/15/23 Proof of Service (not Summons and Complaint); Woods Suppl.
Decl. ¶ 11.) Ms. Woods additionally states in her supplemental declaration that
no response to the Petition has been filed within fifteen (15) days after
service of the Petition. (Woods Suppl. Decl. ¶ 16.)
 
On September 19, 2023, the Clerk entered default against
Respondent. (09/19/23 Request for Entry of Default.) Thus, the
Court finds that the services requirement has been satisfied. 
 
D.        Charges, Attorney’s Fees, and Costs 
 
Civil Code section 798.61,
subdivision (d)(2) provides that: 
 
If, at the hearing, the petitioner shows by a
preponderance of the evidence that the criteria for an abandoned mobilehome has
been satisfied and no party establishes an interest therein at the hearing and
tenders all past due rent and other charges, the court shall enter a judgment
of abandonment, determine the amount of charges to which the petitioner is
entitled, and award attorney's fees and costs to the petitioner. 
 
(Civ. Code, § 798.61(d)(2).)
 
            The Court finds that Petitioner has shown
by a preponderance of evidence that the criteria for an abandoned mobilehome have
been satisfied. Further, the Court notes that no other party has established an
interest in the Mobilehome as evidenced by Respondent’s default and lack of
opposition to the Petition.
 
Here, Petitioner seeks “rent, utilities and other
charges of $26.33 and daily damages, according to proof, from and after
September 1, 2023,” and reasonable attorney’s fees. (Pet. p. 4.) Specifically,
in Petitioner’s separate filed declaration, Petitioner seeks rent, utilities,
and other charges due and owing from March 2022, through and including August
2023, totaling $13,946.00. (Woods Suppl. Decl. ¶ 17.) Petitioner additionally
seeks daily damages accrued between September 01, 2023, to October 24, 2023, totaling
$1,421.82, in addition to attorney’s fees in the amount of $851.03, and costs in the
amount of $461.63. (Id. ¶¶ 18-20; Exh. 7.) Petitioner’s
request is GRANTED. Petitioner is awarded a total of $16,680.48 for the
following: $13,946.00 in rent, utilities, and other charges due
and owing from March 2022, through and including August 2023, $1,421.82 in
daily damages accrued between September 01, 2023, an October 24, 2023, plus $851.03
in attorney’s fees, and $461.63 in costs. 
 
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS the
Petition and awards Petitioner $16,680.48. 
             
III.       Conclusion 
            
            Petitioner Richard Todd
Sherman’s Petition to Declare Mobilehome Abandoned is GRANTED. 
                        
The Court also GRANTS Petitioner’s
request for rent, utilities, and other charges due and owing in the amount of
$13,946.00, daily damages in the amount of $1421.82, $851.03 in attorney’s
fees, and costs of suit in the amount of $461.63, for a total of $16,680.48. 
 
Counsel for Petitioner is directed
to electronically submit to the Court a Proposed Judgment for Abandonment,
consistent with this Court’s Ruling, within 10 days.
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
