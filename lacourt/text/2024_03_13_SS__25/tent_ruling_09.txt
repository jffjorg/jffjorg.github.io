Peterson (“David”) and Lori N. Peterson (“Lori”) (collectively “Petersons”  or “Defendants”), and Ryan Beck (“Beck”) for breach of contract. The Complaint  is based on two Bond Application/Indemnity Agreements between Plaintiff and  Petersons (“Agreement 1”) and Plaintiff and Beck (“Agreement 2”) On September 30, 2022, the Petersons filed a Demurrer and Motion to  Strike the Complaint. On October 24, 2022, Plaintiff filed opposition to the  Demurrer and Motion to Strike. On October 31, 2022, the Petersons filed replies  to both oppositions. On October 26, 2022, pursuant to Plaintiff’s request, the Court  entered default against Defendant Beck. On November 07, 2022, the Court overruled the Petersons’ Demurrer and  denied the Motion to Strike, and ordered Defendants to file an Answer to the  complaint within ten days’ notice of the Court’s order. Defendants filed their Answer to Plaintiff’s Complaint on November  17, 2022.  On November 22, 2022, Defendants filed a Cross Complaint against Mr.  Beck for 1) fraud and deceit, 2) intentional misrepresentation, and 3)  fraudulent misrepresentation.  On July 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Summary Judgment  against the Petersons. On September 29, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Notice of No  Opposition to the Motion for Summary Judgment. The Court granted Plaintiff’s  Motion for Summary Judgment on October 05, 2023.  On October 05, 2023, Plaintiff filed Notice of Ruling indicating that  Defendants have been served with a copy of the Court’s Order.  On December 12, 2023, the Court entered default judgment against  Defendant Beck. On December 12, 2023, the Court entered summary judgment against the  Petersons in favor of Plaintiff in the amount of $ 15,140.00 plus accrued  interest at the statutory rate of 10% per annum in the amount of $5,940.48 for  a total amount of $21,080.48. Plaintiff filed notice of entry of judgment on  December 18, 2023. On December 22, 2023, Plaintiff filed its Memorandum of Cost  (Summary).  On January 16, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to be Deemed  Prevailing Party against the Petersons for an Award for Attorney’s Fees. No opposition has been filed.  MOVING PARTY  POSITION                Plaintiff prays for the Court to enter an  award of attorney’s fees of $9,817.00 and recoverable court costs of $1,357.91,  for a total amount of $11,174.91 against the Petersons deeming Plaintiff as the  prevailing party pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1032,1033.5, and Civil  Code § 1717, and the provisions in the parties’ indemnity agreement.   OPPOSITION               No  opposition has been filed.    REPLY               No reply  has been filed.       ANALYSIS   I.          Legal  Standard  A prevailing  party in an action is entitled to recover costs, including attorney’s fees, as  a matter of right.  (See Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1032(a)(4), 1032(b),  1033.5.)  Attorney’s fees are allowable as costs  when authorized by contract, statute, or law.  (Code Civ. Proc. §  1033.5(a)(10).)    In a breach of contract action, attorney’s fees shall be  awarded when a contract provides that one of the parties or the prevailing  party shall be awarded attorney’s fees in an action on that contract.  (See  Civ. Code § 1717.)  A prevailing party is “the party with a net monetary  recovery, a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered, a defendant where  neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief, and a defendant as against  those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against that defendant.”  (Code  of Civ. Proc. § 1032(a)(4).)   “A notice of  motion to claim attorney's fees for services up to and including the rendition  of judgment in the trial court . . . must be served and filed within the time  for filing a notice of appeal under . . . rules 8.822 and 8.823 in a limited  civil case.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1702(b)(1).)  In a limited civil  case, a notice of appeal must be filed on or before the earliest of 30 days  after service of a document entitled “Notice of Entry” of judgment or 90 days  after the entry of judgment. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.822(a)(1).)    The fee setting inquiry in  California ordinarily begins with the “lodestar” method, i.e., the number of  hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.  A  computation of time spent on a case and the reasonable value of that time is  fundamental to a determination of an appropriate attorneys’ fee award.   The lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on factors specific to the  case, to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services  provided.  (Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49.)  Such  an approach anchors the trial court’s analysis to an objective determination of  the value of the attorney’s services, ensuring that the amount awarded is not  arbitrary.  (Id. at p. 48, fn. 23.)  After the trial court has  performed the lodestar calculations, it shall consider whether the total award  so calculated under all of the circumstances of the case is more than a  reasonable amount and, if so, shall reduce the section 1717 award so that it is  a reasonable figure.  (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th  1084, 1095-1096.)    As explained in Graciano v.  Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154:    “[T]he lodestar is the basic fee for comparable legal  services in the community; it may be adjusted by the court based on factors  including, as relevant herein, (1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions  involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which  the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4)  the contingent nature of the fee award. [Citation.] The purpose of such  adjustment is to fix a fee at the fair market value for the particular action.  In effect, the court determines, retrospectively, whether the litigation  involved a contingent risk or required extraordinary legal skill justifying  augmentation of the unadorned lodestar in order to approximate the fair market  rate for such services. . .. This approach anchors the trial court's analysis  to an objective determination of the value of the attorney's services, ensuring  that the amount awarded is not arbitrary.” [Internal citations and internal  quotation marks omitted.]    (Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144  Cal.App.4th 140.) “It is well established that the determination of what  constitutes reasonable attorney fees is committed to the discretion of the  trial court, whose decision cannot be reversed in the absence of an abuse of  discretion. [Citations.]  The value of legal services performed in a case  is a matter in which the trial court has its own expertise. . .. The trial  court makes its determination after consideration of a number of factors,  including the nature of the litigation, its difficulty, the amount involved,  the skill required in its handling, the skill employed, the attention given,  the success or failure, and other circumstances in the case.   [Citations.]”  (Melnyk v. Robledo (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618,  623624.)      No specific findings reflecting  the court’s calculations are required.  The record need only show that the  attorney fees were awarded according to the “lodestar” or “touchstone”  approach. The court’s focus in evaluating the facts should be to provide a fee  award reasonably designed to completely compensate attorneys for the services  provided.  The starting point for this determination is the attorney’s  time records. (Horsford v. Board of Trustees of Calif. State Univ.  (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 395-397 [verified time records entitled to credence  absent clear indication they are erroneous].)  However, California case  law permits fee awards in the absence of detailed time sheets. (Sommers v. Erb (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1644, 1651; Dunk v. Ford Motor Co.  (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1794, 1810; Nightingale v. Hyundai Motor America  (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 103.)  An experienced trial judge is able to  assess the value of the professional services rendered in his or her  court.  (Id.; Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49; Wershba  v. Apple Computer, Inc. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 224, 255.)    II.        Discussion    As a preliminary matter, the Court  notes that the Motion is timely filed.    CRC rule 3.1702(b)(1) states in  relevant part that “A notice of motion to claim attorney’s fees for services up  to and including the rendition of judgment in the trial court . . . must be  served and filed within the time for filing a notice of appeal under . . .  rules 8.822 and 8.823 in a limited civil case.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule  3.1702(b)(1).) In a limited civil case, a notice of appeal must be filed on or  before the earliest of 30 days after service of a document entitled “Notice of  Entry” of judgment or 90 days after the entry of judgment. (Cal. Rules of  Court, rule 8.822(a)(1).)     Here, Petitioner served Notice of  Entry of Judgement on December 18, 2023. (12/18/23 Notice of Entry of Judgment.).  Here, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion on January 16, 2024, less than 30 days  from when it served its Notice of Entry of Judgment on the Petersons. Therefore,  the Court considers the motion timely filed under CRC rule 3.1702(b)(1).    The Court finds  Plaintiff to be the prevailing party in the instant case. Here, the Court granted Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary  Judgment against the Petersons on October 05, 2023. (10/05/23 Minute Order.)  The Court entered summary judgment against the Petersons in favor of Plaintiff  on December 12, 2023. (12/12/23 Judgment Pursuant to Summary Judgment.) As part  of the judgment, the Court also awarded “attorneys’ fees to be determined by  memorandum of costs and motion, as provided by law.” (Id.) Thus, as the  prevailing party, Plaintiff is entitled to attorney’s fees and cost.    Here, Plaintiff provides the  Court with the declaration of its counsel and copy of the Indemnity Agreement  entered between the parties. (Amber N. Kim Decl.; Exh. 1.) The agreement  provides the following language,    2. To indemnify Surety against all losses,  liabilities, costs, damages, attorneys’ and consultants’ fees and expenses the  Surety may incur or has incurred due to the execution and issuance of the bond  on, before or after this date including any modifications, renewals or  extensions of the bond or the enforcement of the terms of this indemnity  agreement.”    (Mot. p. 3; Kim Decl. ¶ 4; Exh. 1 ¶ 2.) (Emphasis added) Thus,  the Court finds that the provision in the Indemnity Agreement allows Plaintiff to  recover attorney’s fees and costs.    Plaintiff requests $9,817.00 in  attorney’s fees. (Id. ¶ 13.)  Plaintiff’s Counsel submits a detailed billing statement to the Court  reflecting the time spent and work performed. (Id.)  Counselor Kim states she bills between $275.00-$325.00 per hour as an associate  with seven years of experience. (Id. ¶ 12.)  Michael K. Murray, a partner at Plaintiff’s Counsel’s firm, charges  $300.00-$375.00 per hour based on his thirteen (13) years of experience. (Id.) Lanak & Hanna, P.C.’s paralegals,  billed between $185.00 and $205.00 per hour.      No opposition has been filed by Defendant to contest Plaintiff’s  arguments.   In determining the reasonable amount of  attorney’s fees, the Court considers the complexity of the tasks, number of hours  expended on each task, and other necessary factors. The Court finds  Plaintiff’s counsel’s billing rate to be reasonable. Having reviewed the  billing statement submitted by Plaintiff’s counsel, the Court finds that the  hours expended are not excessive considering the circumstances in this case.  Given that no opposition or reply papers have been filed, the Court need not  grant an additional $487.50 in fees requested by Plaintiff’s counsel.    The Court grants Plaintiff’s Motion for  Attorney’s Fees in the amount of $9,817.00.     Additionally, the Court reviewed Plaintiff’s Memorandum of Costs  and finds that $1,357.91 in costs is reasonable (12-22-23 Memorandum of Costs).  Thus, Plaintiff’s request for costs is GRANTED for $1,357.91.    Accordingly,  the Court grants Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees and Costs in the amount  of $11,174.91.     III.       Conclusion                           Petitioner American  Contractors Indemnity Company’s Motion to be Deemed Prevailing Party for and  Attorney’s Fees is GRANTED.   Attorney’s Fees in the amount of $9,817.00 and Costs in the  amount of $1,357.91 for a total amount of $11,174.91 are awarded to Plaintiff  and against Defendants David S. Peterson and Lori N. Peterson.  Plaintiff is ordered to Submit an Amended Proposed form of Judgment within 10-days.   Moving party is  ordered to give notice.
