BACKGROUND
 
On January 03, 2020, Plaintiff State Farm Mutual
Automobile Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) filed a subrogation claim against Defendant
Jose Hurtado (“Defendant”). 
 
Defendant filed his answer to Plaintiff’s Complaint on
April 13, 2020. 
 
On January 18, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Settlement
indicating that a conditional settlement had been reached by the parties. 
 
On May 25, 2023, Plaintiff filed a joint stipulation
between itself and Defendant indicating that the parties had reached a
settlement in the case for $10,184.11 and requested the case dismissed without
prejudice. 
 
            On May 31, 2023, the Court ordered
the dismissal of the case without prejudice pursuant to the Stipulation for
Dismissal with the Court retaining jurisdiction pursuant CCP § 664.6. 
 
            On January 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal and Enter Judgment. 
                        
No opposition has been filed. 
 
MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
Plaintiff prays for the Court to set aside
the dismissal entered on May 31, 2023, and enter judgment against Defendant in
the sum of $3,500.00 for the following: the principal amount of $10,184.11
less $7,184.11 in payments made by Defendant’s insurance carrier, plus court
cost totaling $500.00 consisting of: $370.00 complaint filing fee, $89.50
service of process fee, and $60.00 motion fee (the agreement caps cost at $500.00).
Plaintiff argues that Defendant failed to make any monthly payments under the
stipulation, thus putting him in default. Around December 19, 2023, Plaintiff
mailed a default letter to Defendant regarding the missed payments as required
by the Agreement. Since notifying Defendant about the default, Plaintiff
alleges that Defendant has failed to bring payments current. Thus, because of
the payment default, Plaintiff brings the instant motion.

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard
 Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6
(“CCP § 664.6”) states: “If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a
writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If
requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to
enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (a) [emphasis added].) For
purposes of the statute, “a writing is signed by a party if it is signed by any
of the following [among other individuals]: (1) ¶ The party. (2) ¶ An attorney
who represents the party.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (b) [emphasis
added].) 
 
“On a motion to enforce, the court
must determine whether the settlement agreement is valid and binding.
[Citation.] The court assesses whether the material terms of the settlement
were reasonably well-defined and certain, and whether the parties expressly
acknowledged that they understood and agreed to be bound by those terms. [In
re Marriage of Assemi (1994) 7 Cal.4th 896, 911.]” (Estate of
Jones (2022) 82 Cal.App.5th 948, 952.) 
 
The court may
interpret the terms and conditions of a settlement (Fiore v. Alvord
(1985) 182 Cal.App.3d 561, 566), but the court may not create material terms of
a settlement, as opposed to deciding what terms the parties themselves have
previously agreed upon (Weddington Productions, Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60
Cal.App.4th 793, 810). 
 
II.        Discussion 
 
A.
Retention of Jurisdiction
            
“‘[V]oluntary dismissal of an action or special
proceeding terminates the court’s jurisdiction over the matter.’ (Conservatorship
of Martha P. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 857, 867.) ‘If requested by the
parties,’ however, ‘the [trial] court may retain jurisdiction over the parties
to enforce [a] settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.’ (§ 664.6, italics added.)” (Mesa RHF Partners, L.P. v. City of
Los Angeles (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 913, 917.) “‘Because of its summary
nature, strict compliance with the requirements of section 664.6 is
prerequisite to invoking the power of the court to impose a settlement
agreement.’” (Id. (quoting Sully-Miller Contracting Co. v.
Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 30, 37).)
 
“A request for the trial court to retain jurisdiction
under section 664.6 ‘must conform to the same three requirements which the
Legislature and the courts have deemed necessary for section 664.6 enforcement
of the settlement itself: the request must be made (1) during the pendency of
the case, not after the case has been dismissed in its entirety, (2) by the
parties themselves, and (3) either in a writing signed by the parties or orally
before the court.’” (Id. (quoting Wackeen v. Malis (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th
429, 440).) “The ‘request must be express, not implied from other language, and
it must be clear and unambiguous.’” (Id. (quoting Wackeen, supra,
97 Cal.App.4th at 440).)
 
Here,
the parties signed a stipulation containing the parties’ agreement for the
Court to retain jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure §664.6 to enforce
the terms of the Stipulation and enter judgment in the event of default. (05-25-23
Stipulation.) Before dismissing the action, the parties signed the Stipulation
and submitted it to the Court. (Id.
at p. 3.) On May 31, 2023, the Court dismissed the entire case without
prejudice, according to the Stipulation, and expressly stated that it “shall
retain jurisdiction pursuant to CCP § 664.6.” (05-31-23 Order for Dismissal.)
Therefore, the Court finds that the Stipulation complies with the requirements
under CCP § 664.6, and it has retained jurisdiction to enter judgment pursuant
to the parties’ Stipulation in this action.
 
B.
Entry of Judgment 
 
The Settlement
Agreement, filed on May 25, 2023, provides that the parties agreed to settle
the matter for a principal sum of $10,184.11, with Defendant’s insurance
carrier making an initial payment of $7,184.11 by March 01, 2023. (Harlan M.
Reese, Esq. Decl. ¶ 2, Exh. A.) Defendant would subsequently make monthly
payments of $100.00 beginning on the first of each month, until paid in full. (Id.)
Plaintiff provides the Court with the declaration of its counsel who avers that
Defendant’s insurance carrier made a one-time payment of $7,184.11. (Id. ¶ 4.) Defendant subsequently failed
to make any monthly payments under the stipulation, thus putting him into default.
(Id. ¶ 5.) Pursuant to the Agreement,
around December 19, 2023, Plaintiff mailed Defendant a default letter regarding
the missed payments. (Id. ¶ 6;
Exh. B.) Per the Agreement, if no payment correcting the default was made
within fourteen (14) days of issuing a default letter, Plaintiff was entitled
to file a motion vacating the dismissal and have judgment entered. (Id. ¶ 7.) Accordingly, due to
Defendant’s failure to comply with the Settlement Agreement, Plaintiff
requested that a judgment of $3,500.00 be entered against Defendant. (Id. ¶ 8.)
The Court
finds the Settlement Agreement valid and enforceable under CCP § 664.6. Here,
Plaintiff provides evidence that Defendant made no payments or cured the
default after Plaintiff sent notice. (Id. ¶¶
5-7.) Therefore, since a valid and signed settlement agreement between the
parties was breached, and the Court retains jurisdiction to enter judgment, the
motion satisfies the requirements under CCP § 664.6.
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Vacate Dismissal and
Enter Judgment is GRANTED. Dismissal entered on May 31, 2023, is vacated.
Judgment is entered for Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of $3,500.00
for the following: the principal amount of $10,184.11 less $7,184.11
in payments made by Defendant’s insurance carrier, plus court cost totaling $500.00
consisting of: $370.00 complaint filing fee, $89.50 service of process fee, and
$60.00 motion fee (the agreement caps cost at $500.00).
 
III.       Conclusion 
            
Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Auto Insurance Co.’s Motion
to Vacate Dismissal Entered on 05/31/2023 and Enter Judgment is GRANTED.
 
Judgment is entered for Plaintiff and against Defendant in
the amount of $3,500.00.
 
Counsel for Plaintiff is ordered to electronically submit
