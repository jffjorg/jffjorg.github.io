Motion filed on 8/8/24.
 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiffs Steffanie Stelnick; Todd
Stelnick and Southern California Real Estate Management, Inc.
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendants Tamar House; Ryan House;
Southern California Property Management Company, Inc.; Team House Real Estate,
Inc. and Cornerstone Realty Advisors, Inc.
NOTICE: ok
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order granting Plaintiffs
leave to file a Third Amended Complaint. 

 
RULING: The motion is granted.  Plaintiffs are ordered to separately file
their Third Amended Complaint.
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiffs Steffanie Stelnick,
Todd Stelnick, and Southern California Real Estate Management, Inc.’s (SCREM)
(collectively, Plaintiffs) claim that Defendants Ryan House and Tamar House
(collectively, the Houses) have breached a Settlement Agreement that ended a
prior lawsuit.  Plaintiffs contend that
the Houses have repeatedly breached the Settlement Agreement by engaging in
competing activity in violation of a non-compete clauses in the Settlement
Agreement.  The Settlement Agreement
provides that the Houses will owe liquidated damages of $54,000 per
violation.   
 
On 2/1/23, Plaintiffs filed this action against the
Houses and Southern California Property Management Company, Inc. (SCPMC) for:
(1) Breach of Contract and (2) Trademark Infringement (15 U.S.C. 1114(1)).  The operative Second Amended Complaint, filed
on 3/24/23, which includes the same two causes of action against the Houses,
also names Team House Real Estate, Inc. (Team House) and Cornerstone Realty
Advisors, Inc. (Cornerstone) (collectively, Defendants) as defendants. 
 
On 8/2/24, Plaintiffs substituted in their current
counsel, Richard Marcus.  After
Defendants refused to consent to Plaintiffs filing the proposed Third Amended
Complaint, on 8/8/24, Plaintiffs filed and served the instant motion seeking an
order granting them leave to file a Third Amended Complaint which eliminates
the cause of action for Trademark Infringement and adds six new causes of
action for: (1) Intentional Misrepresentation (2nd cause of action),
(2) Negligent Misrepresentation (3rd cause of action), (3)
Misappropriation of Trade Secrets (4th cause of action), (4)
Intentional Interference With Contractual Relations (5th cause of
action), (5) Intentional Interference With Prospective Advantage (6th
cause of action) and (6) Negligent Interference With Prospective Advantage (7th
cause of action).  Defendants have
opposed the motion and Plaintiffs have filed a reply to the opposition.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
“The court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any
terms as may be proper, allow, a party to amend any pleading.”  CCP 473(a)(1); See also CCP 576.  Judicial policy favors resolving all disputed
matters between the parties in the same action. 
Therefore, the court’s discretion will usually be exercised liberally to
allow an amendment to pleadings.  See
Nestle (1972) 6 C3d 920, 939; Mabie (1998) 61 CA4th 581, 596; Howard
(2010) 184 CA4th 1422, 1428. 
 
The policy favoring amendments is so strong that denial
of leave to amend is rarely justified. 
It has been held that “[i]f the motion to amend is timely made and the
granting of the motion will not prejudice the opposing party, it is error to
refuse permission to amend and where the refusal also results in a party being
deprived of the right to assert a meritorious cause of action or a meritorious
defense, it is not only error but an abuse of discretion.”  Morgan (1959) 172 CA2d 527, 530; See
also Mabie, supra; Bettencourt (2012) 205 CA4th 1103,
1111.  
 
Further, usually, the court will not consider the
validity of the proposed amendment in determining whether to grant a motion for
leave to amend.  After leave to amend is
granted, the opposing party will have the opportunity to attack the validity of
the amended pleading by way of demurrer and/or motion to strike.  See Kittredge Sports Co. (1989)
213 CA3d 1045, 1048; Atkinson (2003) 109 CA4th 739, 760.
 
If delay in seeking leave to amend did not mislead or
prejudice the other side, it is an abuse of discretion to deny leave to amend.  See Higgins (1981) 123 CA3d
558, 564-565; Berman (1997) 56 CA4th 936, 945.  
 
Plaintiffs’ counsel has not directly set forth in his
declaration when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were
discovered and/or why the request for amendment was not made earlier as
required.  See CRC 3.1324(b)(3),
(4); (Marcus Decl., generally).  It
appears that the only explanation is that Plaintiffs’ new counsel discovered
the need for the proposed new causes of action upon his substituting in as
Plaintiffs’ counsel.  (See Marcus
Decl. ¶14; Reply, p.3:13-21).  The Court
finds that the judicial policy of liberally allowing amendments to pleadings,
outweighs such procedural deficiency.  
 
Defendants concede that the proposed new causes of action
are not based on any new facts.  (See
Opposition, p.6:2-3).  Given that this
case was filed less than 2-years ago and initial trial date is almost 3 months
away, Defendants have failed to establish that they will be unduly prejudiced
by the granting of the instant motion.  
 
The Court finds that any prejudice to Defendants can be
resolved by continuing the trial date to allow Defendants to file a demurrer
and/or motion to strike the new claims and allowing time to conduct any
necessary additional discovery. 
Puzzlingly, despite making demurrer-like arguments in the opposition to
the instant motion, Defendants argue against a trial continuance, if the
instant motion is granted.  (See
Opposition, p.7:24-p.14:22). 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted. 
Plaintiffs are ordered to separately file their Third Amended Complaint
which is attached to the motion as Exhibit A.
 
At the hearing, the Court will discuss with counsel the
need for a trial continuance and the length of such a continuance.  
 
The Court notes that Plaintiff’s counsel has failed to
properly electronically bookmark the exhibits attached to the motion as
required by CRC 3.1110(f)(4).  Counsel
for the parties are warned that failure to comply with this rule in the future
may result in matters being continued so that papers can be re-filed in
compliance, papers not being considered and/or the imposition of
sanctions.
