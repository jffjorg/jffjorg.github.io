RULING: The motion is granted as set forth
below.  
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiff Tyler Rayne’s
(Plaintiff) claim that Defendants/Cross-Defendants Ignat (Ignat) and Daria (Daria)
Stepanenko, husband and wife, forged a grant deed conveying Plaintiff’s
one-half interest in their deceased mother’s residential property to Ignat.  Thereafter, Ignat gave
Defendant/Cross-Complainant Jack Shut (Shut) a deed of trust to secure a
$247,000.00 mortgage against the property. 

 
In his complaint, Plaintiff alleges that his and Ignat’s
mother, Yelena Stepanenko (Yelena) acquired the fee simple title interest in
the subject residential real property in Canoga Park (commonly known as 23774
Burton Street, Los Angeles, California 91304) (the Property) via a Grant Deed
recorded on 9/27/13. (Complaint ¶16; Shut’s Request for Judicial Notice (RJN),
Ex. 1, 9/27/13 Grant Deed).  After a
series of conveyances in 2019, title to the Property vested in Yelena, as
Trustee of the Yelena Stepanenko Revocable Trust Dated September 17, 2015
(Yelena Trust) and Plaintiff by way of a Quitclaim Deed recorded on 9/25/19.  (RJN, Ex.2-5, 9/18/15 Grant Deed, 5/10/19
Grant Deed, 7/19/19 Grant Deed, 9/24/19 Quitclaim Deed).  
 
Yelena died on 5/18/21. 
(RJN, Ex.6).
 
Plaintiff alleges that “Defendant IGNAT STEPANENKO
unlawfully converted the Subject Property and the funds that he received as a
result of the Trust Deed in the amount of two-hundred thousand dollars
($200,000) as the borrower without Plaintiff’s knowledge, authorization or
consent.”  (Complaint, ¶ 64).  Plaintiff further alleges that “Defendants
caused a false Grant Deed to be recorded purporting to have been executed on
November 19, 2021 by Plaintiff, a single man, and further purporting to grant
all of his interest in the Real Property to Defendant IGNAT STEPANENKO, a
married man as his sole and separate property.” (Complaint ¶65).  This Grant Deed, recorded on 11/23/21,
conveyed the fee simple interest in the Property from both Ignat, as Successor
Trustee of the Yelena Trust, and Plaintiff to Ignat alone. (RJN, Ex.7, 11/23/21
Grant Deed; Complaint ¶19).   Plaintiff contends that his signature on this
Grant Deed is a forgery.  (Complaint
¶¶21-24).  
 
On 11/23/21, a Deed of Trust in favor of beneficiary Shut
was recorded to secure a $200,000.00 loan from Shut to Ignat.  (RJN, Ex.8, 11/23/21 Deed of Trust).  
 
By way of his complaint filed on 4/1/22, Plaintiff seeks
to void the 11/23/21 Grant Deed and  Deed
of Trust.  (Complaint ¶¶28-29).
 
On 6/30/22, Shut filed an answer to Plaintiff’s complaint
and a cross-complaint which seeks to affirm the validity of the 11/23/21 Deed
of Trust as a lien against the Property or in the alternative to establish an
equitable lien for the amount Shut’s loan proceeds paid off existing liens on
the Property, as well as reforming an erroneous legal description in the
11/21/22 Grant Deed and Deed of Trust.  (See
6/30/22 Cross-Complaint, generally).
 
Having failed to respond to either the complaint or
cross-complaint, Ignat and Daria’s defaults on both pleadings have been
entered.  (See Default entered
5/27/22 on Complaint; Default entered 11/23/22 on Cross-Complaint).
 
On 8/7/23, Shut caused Daria to be personally served with
a Deposition Subpoena For Personal Appearance And Production Of Documents And
Things (Subpoena) at the Property which Shut contends is Ignat and Daria’s
residence.  (Leonhardt Decl., Ex.9,
Subpoena).  The Subpoena ordered Daria’s
appearance for deposition on 9/1/23.  Id.    
 
Pursuant to CCP 2025.220(b), on 8/15/23, Shut’s counsel
served a Notice of Deposition for the Subpoena served on Daria to the parties
in the action.  (Leonhardt Decl., Ex.10,
Notice of Deposition).  
 
On 9/1/23, Daria failed to appear for her
deposition.  (Leonhardt Decl. ¶16, Ex.11,
Affidavit Of Certified Shorthand Reporter Re Nonappearance Of Witness of
Witness, dated 9/1/23).  Daria failed to
contact Shut’s counsel to request rescheduling of the deposition.  (Id. at ¶16).
 
On 10/16/23, Shut’s counsel sent Daria a meet and confer
letter addressing her non-compliance with the Subpoena.  (Leonhardt Decl., Ex.12, Letter to Daria,
dated 10/16.23).  Shut’s counsel received
no response.   (Leonhardt Decl. ¶17).
 
Therefore, on 2/13/24, Shut filed and served on the other
parties who have appeared in this action a motion seeking an order to show
cause re contempt and for sanctions against defaulted Defendant/Cross-Defendant
Daria Stepanenko for her refusal to comply with a Deposition Subpoena for
Personal Appearance and Production of Documents and Things, and for an award of
sanctions in the amount of $3,304.00 against Daria Stepanenko.  On 2/16/24, Shut filed a proof of service
indicating the motion was served by U.S. Mail on Ignat and Daria on 2/16/24.
 
On 7/19/24, the Court placed the motion filed on 2/13/24 off
calendar due to insufficient notice.  (See
7/19/24 Minute Order).
 
On 7/24/24, Shut filed and served on the other parties
who have appeared in this action the instant motion seeking an order to show
cause re contempt and for sanctions against defaulted Defendant/Cross-Defendant
Daria Stepanenko for her refusal to comply with a Deposition Subpoena for
Personal Appearance and Production of Documents and Things, and for an award of
sanctions in the amount of $3,304.00 against Daria Stepanenko.  Specifically, Shut requests that the Court
order Daria to immediately comply in appearing for deposition by a date certain
or be subject to imprisonment.  (See
Motion, p.1:27-p.2:1).  On 7/27/24, Shut
personally served the above motion on Daria. 
(See Proof of Service filed 8/7/24).      
 
No opposition or other response to the motion has been
filed.
 
ANALYSIS   
 
Shut’s Request for Judicial Notice (RJN) is granted.
 
An indirect contempt proceeding is commenced by the
filing of an affidavit and a request for an order to show cause.  Cedars-Sinai Imaging Medical Group
(2000) 83 CA4th 1281, 1286 citing CCP 1211(a). 
It has been held that after notice to the opposing party’s counsel, if
the court is satisfied with the sufficiency of the affidavit, it must sign an
Order to Show Cause re Contempt in which the date and time of the hearing are
set forth.  Id. citing CCP 1212.
 
Since Daria is in default and not represented by counsel,
Shut properly personally served her with notice of the 9/4/24 hearing on this
matter.  (See Proof of Service
filed 8/7/24). 
 
The attendance and testimony of a deponent who is not a
party to the action, as well as the production by the deponent of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing for inspection and
copying, requires the service on the deponent of a deposition subpoena.  CCP  2025.280(b); See also Terry
(2009) 175 CA4th 352, 357.
 
A deponent who disobeys a deposition subpoena may be
punished for contempt, without the necessity of a prior court order directing
compliance by the witness or any showing of good cause.  CCP 1209(a)(10), CCP 1991, CCP 1991.1, CCP 2020.240,
CCP 2023.030(e). “Disobedience to a subpoena, or a refusal to be sworn, or to
answer as a witness, or to subscribe an affidavit or deposition when required,
may be punished as a contempt by the court issuing the subpoena.” CCP 1991.
“‘Disobedience’ means a conscious refusal to attend the deposition. It must be
shown that the witness had knowledge of the subpoena, the ability to comply
with it, and deliberately failed to do so.” Weil & Brown, California Practice
Guide Civil Procedure Before Trial Ch. 8E-6, ¶ 8:535.
 
A person found guilty of contempt is subject to a fine
(up to $1,000) or imprisonment (up to 5 days), or both.  CCP 1218(a); See People v. Gonzalez
(1996) 12 C4th 804, 816.  A court may  also impose civil contempt sanctions: i.e.,
imprisonment until the party complies (or as a practical matter, agrees to
comply).  CCP 1219(a).
 
Monetary sanctions may also be imposed on non-parties who
disobey the discovery process.  Temple
Community Hospital (1999) 20 C4th 464, 476-477; Sears, Roebuck & Co.
(2005) 131 CA4th 1342, 1350-1351; CCP 2023.010(d), (g), (i); CCP 2023.030(a).
 
Here, Shut has incurred fees and costs in the amount of $3,304.00
in relation to Daria’s failed deposition and the instant motion.  (Leonhardt Decl. ¶¶19-21).  
 
CONCLUSION
 
The Court finds the declaration of attorney Donald E.
Leonhardt sufficient to support the issuance of an Order to Show Cause Re
Contempt and Sanctions against Daria.  Therefore,
the Court will issue/sign an Order to Show Cause as to why Daria Stepanenko aka
Darya Malomuzh should not be held in contempt for failing to comply with the Deposition
Subpoena for Personal Appearance served on 8/7/23 and why monetary sanctions
should not be imposed against Daria Stepanenko aka Darya Malomuzh.    
 
Shut must personally serve Daria Stepanenko with the affidavit
filed in support of this motion and the Order to Show Cause.  See Cedars-Sinai Imaging Medical
Group (2000) 83 CA4th 1281, 1286-1287
