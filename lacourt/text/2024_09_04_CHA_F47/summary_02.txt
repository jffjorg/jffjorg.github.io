And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge grants Plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a Third Amended Complaint, which eliminates the cause of action for Trademark Infringement and adds six new causes of action. The Judge finds that the policy favoring amendments to pleadings outweighs any procedural deficiencies in Plaintiffs' motion. The Judge also finds that any prejudice to Defendants can be resolved by continuing the trial date to allow Defendants to file a demurrer and/or motion to strike the new claims and allowing time to conduct any necessary additional discovery.
