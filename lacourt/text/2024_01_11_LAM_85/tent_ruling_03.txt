 Case Number:  23STCV02582    Hearing Date:   January 11, 2024    Dept:  85 
Med-Plus Pharmacy, Inc, dba
Med-Plus Pharmacy, LTC, v. Anaheim Healthcare Center, LLC et al, 23STCV02582
Tentative decision on applications
for right to attach orders: granted in part




 
 
            
            Plaintiff
Med-Plus Pharmacy, LLC, formerly Med-Plus Pharmacy, Inc, doing business as
Med-Plus Pharmacy, LTC (“Med-Plus”) applies for right to attach orders against (1)
Defendant Community Care Rehab Center, LLC (“Community”) for $297,542.88 and
(2) Defendant Villa Rancho Bernardo Health Care, LLC (“Villa Rancho”) for $499,980.48.
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply, and
renders the following tentative decision. 
            
            A. Statement of the Case
            1.
Complaint
            Plaintiff Med-Plus filed the
Complaint on February 6, 2023 against Defendants Anaheim Healthcare
Center (“Anaheim”), Bartlett Care Center,
LLC (“Bartlett”), Citrus Nursing Center, College
Vista, LLC, Country Oaks Partners, LLC, Community; F. & B. Healthcare,
Garden Park Care Center, LLC, Gibraltar Convalescent Hospital, Inc. (“Gibraltar”),
Gordon Lane Healthcare, LLC, Heritage Manor Healthcare, LLC, Inland Medical
Enterprises, Inc., MJB Partners, LLC, Monterey Park Convalescent Hospital, Inc.,
Paramount Convalescent Group, Inc., Park Regency Care, LLC, PC Care, LLC,
Puente Partners, LLC, Riverside Equities, LLC, Sierra View Care Holdings, LLC,
Sun Mar Healthcare, Inc., Villa Rancho, and Wyngate Nursing Center.  The Complaint alleges a single cause of
action for breach of written contract for each Defendant except Gibraltar, for
which it alleges two.  The Complaint
alleges in pertinent part as follows.
            Defendants are all affiliates of Sun
Mar Management Services (“Sun Mar”), and its CEO is the authorized
representative of each Defendant.  Med-Plus
signed a Pharmacy Service Agreement (“Agreement”) with each Defendant, and two
with Gibraltar for two different convalescent hospitals, whereby it agreed to
provide the listed pharmacy services at the listed rates and prices.  Med-Plus agreed to bill for these services
monthly, and each Defendant agreed to pay each invoice within 90 days of its
receipt.  A Defendant’s failure to pay
the invoice on time would cause the invoice to accrue interest on the unpaid
balance at the maximum rate under California law.  
            If a Defendant terminated its
Agreement without cause, it would be responsible for payment of all amounts due
to Med-Plus for the remainder of the Agreement’s term.  In any action over non-payment of amounts
owed, the prevailing party would be entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees and
costs.  
            In July 2021, Med-Plus and
Defendants entered into written amendments for each Agreement (“Amendment”)
that changed the per diem rates, the drugs that Med-Plus would provide, and the
pricing of antibiotics and other medications that Med-Plus already provided
under each Agreement.
            In May 2022, each Defendant breached
its Agreement by failing to pay the February 2022 invoice.  Defendants subsequently failed to pay the
invoices for March through August 2022, and some Defendants also failed to pay
an invoice for September 2022.  Because
all of these invoices are over 90 days overdue, Med-Plus is entitled to
interest thereon at the maximum rate.
            The original termination date for
each Agreement ranged from October to December 2024.
In
September 2022, Defendants terminated their Agreements without cause.  Med-Plus is entitled to recover all lost
profits it would have earned through the remainder of each Agreement’s term.  
            For each Defendant, Med-Plus seeks the
sum of all unpaid invoices, interest at the maximum rate under California law, lost
profits through the end of that Agreement’s term according to proof, and
attorney’s fees and costs.
            
            2.
Course of Proceedings
            On February 16, 2023,
Defendants signed and filed a joint Notice and Acknowledgment of Receipt.
            On March 1, 2023,
Med-Plus served all Defendants with a “Proof of Service Re: Notice and
Acknowledgment of Receipt” by electronic and first-class mail.  
            On March 30, 2023, all
Defendants filed a joint Answer.
            On May 19, 2023, the
court denied an ex parte application for a temporary protective order against
Anaheim and all Defendants because Med-Plus failed to file a proper application
and failed to show that an emergency existed justifying ex parte relief.
            On June 29, 2023, the
court denied Med-Plus’s applications for right to attach orders against Anaheim
for $606,439.75 and Bartlett for $334,587.99.
            On January 2, 2024, the
parties stipulated to amend the Complaint to reflect that Med-Plus was now a
limited liability company.  The court ordered
the amendment on January 4, 2024.
            
            B.
Applicable Law
            Attachment
is a prejudgment remedy providing for the seizure of one or more of the
defendant’s assets to aid in the collection of a money demand pending the
outcome of the trial of the action.  See
Whitehouse v. Six Corporation, (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 527, 533.  In 1972, and in a 1977 comprehensive
revision, the Legislature enacted attachment legislation (CCP §481.010 et
seq.) that meets the due process requirements set forth in Randone v.
Appellate Department, (1971) 5 Cal.3d 536. 
See Western Steel & Ship Repair v. RMI, (12986) 176
Cal.App.3d 1108, 1115.  As the attachment
statutes are purely the creation of the Legislature, they are strictly
construed.  Vershbow v. Reiner,
(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 879, 882.




            A
writ of attachment may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for
money, each of which is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the
total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount
not less than five hundred dollars ($500). 
CCP §483.010(a).  A claim is
“readily ascertainable” where the amount due may be clearly ascertained from
the contract and calculated by evidence; the fact that damages are unliquidated
is not determinative.  CIT
Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v. Super DVD, Inc., (“CIT”) (2004)
115 Cal.App.4th 537, 540-41 (attachment appropriate for claim based on rent
calculation for lease of commercial equipment).
            All
property within California of a corporation, association, or partnership is
subject to attachment if there is a method of levy for the property.  CCP §487.010(a), (b).  While a trustee is a natural person, a trust
is not.  Therefore, a trust’s property is
subject to attachment on the same basis as a corporation or partnership.  Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn &
Rossi v. Wilson, supra, 197 Cal.App.3d at 4.
            The
plaintiff may apply for a right to attach order by noticing a hearing for the
order and serving the defendant with summons and complaint, notice of the
application, and supporting papers any time after filing the complaint.  CCP §484.010. 
Notice of the application must be given pursuant to CCP section 1005,
sixteen court days before the hearing.  See
ibid.
            The
notice of the application and the application may be made on Judicial Council
forms (Optional Forms AT-105, 115).  The
application must be supported by an affidavit showing that the plaintiff on the
facts presented would be entitled to a judgment on the claim upon which the
attachment is based.  CCP §484.030.  
             Where the defendant is a corporation, a
general reference to “all corporate property which is subject to attachment
pursuant to subdivision (a) of Code of Civil Procedure Section 487.010” is
sufficient.  CCP §484.020(e).  Where the defendant is a partnership or other
unincorporated association, a reference to “all property of the partnership or
other unincorporated association which is subject to attachment pursuant to
subdivision (b) of Code of Civil Procedure Section 487.010” is sufficient.  CCP §484.020(e).  A specific description of property is not
required for corporations and partnerships as they generally have no exempt
property.  Bank of America v. Salinas
Nissan, Inc., (“Bank of America”) (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 268.
            A
defendant who opposes issuance of the order must file and serve a notice of
opposition and supporting affidavit as required by CCP section 484.060 not
later than five court days prior to the date set for hearing.  CCP §484.050(e).  The notice of opposition may be made on a
Judicial Council form (Optional Form AT-155). 

            The
plaintiff may file and serve a reply two court days prior to the date set for
the hearing.  CCP §484.060(c). 
            At
the hearing, the court determines whether the plaintiff should receive a right
to attach order and whether any property which the plaintiff seeks to attach is
exempt from attachment.  The defendant
may appear the hearing.  CCP
§484.050(h).  The court generally will
evaluate the attachment application based solely on the pleadings and
supporting affidavits without taking additional evidence.  Bank of America, supra, 207
Cal.App.3d at 273. A verified complaint may be used in lieu of or in addition
to an affidavit if it states evidentiary facts. 
CCP §482.040.  The plaintiff has
the burden of proof, and the court is not required to accept as true any
affidavit even if it is undisputed.  See
Bank of America, supra, at 271, 273.



            The
court may issue a right to attach order (Optional Form AT-120) if the plaintiff
shows all of the following: (1) the claim on which the attachment is based is
one on which an attachment may be issued (CCP §484.090(a)(1)); (2) the
plaintiff has established the probable validity of the claim (CCP
§484.090(a)(2)); (3) attachment is sought for no purpose other than the
recovery on the subject claim (CCP §484.090(a)(3); and (4) the amount to be
secured by the attachment is greater than zero (CCP §484.090(a)(4)). 
            A
claim has “probable validity” where it is more likely than not that the
plaintiff will recover on that claim. 
CCP §481.190.  In determining this
issue, the court must consider the relative merits of the positions of the
respective parties.  Kemp Bros.
Construction, Inc. v. Titan Electric Corp., (“Kemp”) (2007) 146
Cal.App.4th 1474, 1484.  The court does
not determine whether the claim is actually valid; that determination will be
made at trial and is not affected by the decision on the application for the
order.  CCP §484.050(b).
            Except
in unlawful detainer actions, the amount to be secured by the attachment is the
sum of (1) the amount of the defendant’s indebtedness claimed by the plaintiff,
and (2) any additional amount included by the court for estimate of costs and
any allowable attorneys’ fees under CCP section 482.110.  CCP §483.015(a); Goldstein v. Barak
Construction, (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 845, 852.  This amount must be reduced by the sum of (1)
the amount of indebtedness that the defendant has in a money judgment against
plaintiff, (2) the amount claimed in a cross-complaint or affirmative defense
and shown would be subject to attachment against the plaintiff, and (3) the
value of any security interest held by the plaintiff in the defendant’s
property, together with the amount by which the acts of the plaintiff (or a
prior holder of the security interest) have decreased that security interest’s
value.  CCP §483.015(b); see also
CCP §483.010(b) (“an attachment may not be issued on a claim which is secured
by any interest in real property arising from agreement, statute, or other rule
of law…However, an attachment may be issued where the claim was originally so
secured but, without any act of the plaintiff or the person to whom the
security was given, the security has become valueless or has decreased in value
to less than the amount then owing on the claim).  A defendant claiming that the amount to be
secured should be reduced because of a cross-claim or affirmative defense must
make a prima facie showing that the claim would result in an attachment
against the plaintiff.
            Before
the issuance of a writ of attachment, the plaintiff is required to file an
undertaking to pay the defendant any amount the defendant may recover for any
wrongful attachment by the plaintiff in the action.  CCP §489.210. 
The undertaking ordinarily is $10,000. CCP §489.220.  If the defendant objects, the court may
increase the amount of undertaking to the amount determined as the probable
recovery for wrongful attachment.  CCP
§489.220.  The court also has inherent
authority to increase the amount of the undertaking sua sponte.  North Hollywood Marble Co. v. Superior
Court, (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 683, 691.
            
            C. Statement of Facts
            1. Med-Plus’s Evidence[1]
            a. The Agreements
            Neil Farage (“Farage”) is Med-Plus’s
current Vice-President of Operations and was its Chief Operating Officer
(“COO”) until March 2020.  Farage Decl.,
¶2.[2]  In that capacity, he negotiated and wrote the
first drafts of the Agreements.  Farage
Decl., ¶2.  A Med-Plus account executive
then revised, negotiated, and executed the final Agreement with each Defendant.  Farage Decl., ¶3.  
            On August 29, 2019, Farage
negotiated and signed the Agreements at issue in this application (“Community
Agreement” and “Villa Rancho Agreement”) at the Sun Mar offices.  Farage Community Decl., ¶4, Ex. A; Farage Villa
Rancho Decl., ¶4, Ex. A.  The Community
Agreement was entered into as of November 1, 2019, and the Villa Rancho
Agreement was entered into as of December 1, 2019.  Id. 
Pursuant to the Agreements, Med-Plus
agreed to provide various pharmacy services to each Defendant.  Id. 

            The Agreements charged a “per diem”
rate per resident.  Id.  They then added fees for different medications
and for each attempt to provide certain services to residents.  Id.  Med-Plus agreed to first bill Medi-Cal, Medicare,
or the patient’s private insurer for the amount owed and would only bill the
facility for the balance not covered by the payors.  Id. 

            Payment for Med-Plus’s services
would be due 90 days after that Defendant received an invoice from Med-Plus.  Farage Community Decl., ¶¶ 4, 8, Ex. A;
Farage Villa Rancho Decl., ¶¶ 4, 8, Ex. A. 
Under Agreement section 3.5a, the Defendants were required to notify
Med-Plus in writing of any dispute as to any of the patient days, skilled care,
non-covered products, or supplies and quantity not allowed.  Ex. A. 
Med-Plus would have access to any reasonable and necessary documents
that would tend to sustain its claim. 
Ex. A.  When a Defendant disputed
the amounts for non-covered products or supplies, it was required to promptly
furnish any information to Med-Plus to enable it to exhaust all attempts to
obtain reimbursement within the time allowed by the paying agency.  Ex. A. 

            No claim or disputed amounts from
either party could arise more than 30 days after the invoice’s billing date.  Ex. A. 
The parties agreed to resolve such a dispute within 30 days of when it
arose.  Ex. A.  Depending on whether the disputed claim was
sustained, either the Defendant must pay the bill in full or Med-Plus must issue
a credit.  Ex. A. 
            In June 2021, Sun Mar President
Nathan Ure (“Ure”) asked Farage for better pricing on some of the drugs
Med-Plus sold to Defendants.  Farage
Decl., ¶5.  On July 21, 2021, the parties
signed the Amendment decreasing the per diem rate, adding new drugs, and adjusting
the prices for existing drugs under the original Agreements.  Farage Decl., ¶5, Ex. B.
            Farage oversaw the preparation of
invoices for Defendants, whom Med-Plus billed monthly.  Farage Decl., ¶7.  Under his supervision, Med-Plus employees prepared
the invoices and transmitted them by email. 
Farage Decl., ¶7.  Invoices
included patient names, prescription numbers, and descriptions of specific
medications and products ultimately furnished to patients.  Farage Decl.,
¶7.  Although Med-Plus sent the invoices
to each Defendant, Sun Mars sent payment checks for all Agreements in a single
envelope each month.  Farage Decl., ¶7. 

 
            b. Community
            Community did not pay any of Med-Plus’
invoices for February to August 2022. 
Farage Community Decl., ¶8.
            The invoices for Community list the
charges by category.  Farage Community
Decl., ¶8, Ex. C.  They show that the amount
due for services rendered was $35,405.82
in February 2022, $29,453.40 in March 2022, $45,233.07 in April 2022, $37,518.03
in May 2022, $54,100.03 in June 2022, $49,038.13 in July 2022, and $47,381.42
in August 2022.  Farage Community Decl.,
¶8, Ex. C.  After credits, the total
amount owed is $297,542.88.  Farage Community
Decl., ¶8.
            Neither Sun-Mar nor Community has
ever complained to Med-Plus as to the unpaid invoices or the products and services
Med-Plus provided as shown on those invoices. 
 Farage Community Decl., ¶9.  They also have not explained why the invoices
remain unpaid.  Farage Community Decl.,
¶9.  
 
            c. Villa Rancho
            Villa Rancho did not pay any of Med-Plus’
invoices from February to August 2022. 
Farage Villa Rancho Decl., ¶8.
            The invoices for Villa Rancho list
the charges by category.  Farage Villa
Rancho Decl., ¶8, Ex. C.  They show that
the amount due for services rendered was $90,392.13 in February 2022, $85,468.02
in March 2022, $57,548.30 in April 2022, $61,014.12 in May 2022, $68,906.18 in
June 2022, $70,369.36 in July 2022, and $66,453.35 in August 2022.  Farage Villa Rancho Decl., ¶8, Ex. C.  After credits,
the total amount owed is $499,980.48. 
Farage Villa Rancho Decl., ¶8.  
            Neither Sun-Mar nor Villa Rancho has
ever complained to Med-Plus as to the unpaid invoices or the products and
services Med-Plus provided as shown on those invoices.   Farage Villa Rancho Decl., ¶9.  They also have not explained why the invoices
remain unpaid.  Farage Villa Rancho
Decl., ¶9.  
 
            2. Defendants’ Evidence[3]
            a. Med-Plus’ Billing History
            Community houses 162 patient beds
and averages about 90% occupancy.  Mader
Decl., ¶2.  Villa Rancho houses 299
patient beds and averages about 94% occupancy. 
Rhead Decl., ¶2.
            Both facilities timely paid the
amount they owed Med-Plus through most of their business relationship.  Mader Decl., ¶3; Rhead Decl., ¶3.  Med-Plus prepared invoices every month that
reflected the goods and services it provided. 
Mader Decl., ¶3; Rhead Decl., ¶3. 
These invoices typically included hundreds of pages of back-up
documentation with the types and amounts of services provided to each
patient.  Mader Decl., ¶3; Rhead Decl., ¶3.  
            Med-Plus did not include back-up
documentation for Community’s August 2022 invoice or Villa Rancho’s invoices
from March through August 2022.  Mader
Decl., ¶3; Rhead Decl., ¶3.  For those
months, Med-Plus provided only a one-page summary invoice.  Mader Decl., ¶3; Rhead Decl., ¶3.   
 
            b. Rebates
            Because Defendants buy their
pharmaceutical goods in bulk, they qualify for rebates from drug manufacturers
to offset the cost of the medications.  Dehghanmanesh
Decl., ¶2.  To receive these rebates, they
had to submit medication claims provided by Med-Plus.  Dehghanmanesh Decl., ¶3.  Defendants submitted medication claims from
Med-Plus beginning in March 2019, which included claims starting in September
2018.  Dehghanmanesh Decl., ¶5.  Defendants received rebates for every month
they submitted claims through 2021. 
Dehghanmanesh Decl., ¶¶ 6-7.
            On December 10, 2021, Ure announced
in an email to Sun Mar and Med-Plus employees that it was his last day as a Sun
Mar employee.  Dehghanmanesh Decl., ¶10,
Ex. 1.  
            Starting in January 2022, Defendants’
medication claims for January through May 2022 were all rejected as duplicate
claims.  Dehghanmanesh Decl., ¶¶
7-8.  
            On May 13, 2022, Dehghanmanesh emailed
several Med-Plus employees that Sun Mar’s claims for January, February, and
March had been rejected as duplicates because another party had already claimed
the rebate.  Dehghanmanesh Decl., ¶10,
Ex. 1.  Dehghanmanesh asked if Med-Plus
was that party.  Dehghanmanesh Decl., ¶10,
Ex. 1.  Med-Plus replied that day that it
had been sending data to “Nathan” and never had any issue of duplication
before.  Dehghanmanesh Decl., ¶10, Ex.
1.  It would continue to submit the data after
the end of the business day on the 23rd of each month.  Dehghanmanesh Decl., ¶10, Ex. 1.  
            On July 19, 2022, Med-Plus asked Dehghanmanesh
to confirm when Sun Mar would pay the invoices for February or March 2022.  Dehghanmanesh Decl., ¶11, Ex. 2.  Dehghanmanesh replied the checks were ready,
but he would not send them until the rebate issue was resolved.  Dehghanmanesh Decl., ¶11, Ex. 2.  He asserted that everything indicated that Med-Plus
had received the rebate money.  Dehghanmanesh
Decl., ¶11, Ex. 2.  
            On July 21, 2022, Dehghanmanesh again
told Med-Plus that Sun Mar’s medication claims for the first five months of
2022 had been rejected as duplicates.  Dehghanmanesh
Decl., ¶10, Ex. 1.  Empirian Health, the
company submitting these claims for Sun Mar, had confirmed Med-Plus was
submitting those claims.  Dehghanmanesh
Decl., ¶10, Ex. 1.  Dehghanmanesh
attached a few examples of duplicate claims from January through March
2022.  Dehghanmanesh Decl., ¶10, Ex.
1.  
 
            c. Previous Right to Attach
Applications
            On June 29, 2023, the court denied
Med-Plus’s applications for right to attach orders against Defendants Anaheim
and Bartlett.  Brucker Decl., Ex. 1.  The memoranda for the applications were
deficient under CRC 3.1113(a) for failure to cite relevant law.  Ex. 1, p. 6. 
Med-Plus also did not discuss the services provided or how the invoices
were calculated.  Ex. 1, p. 6.  
            As to whether the damages were
ascertainable, Defendants argued that one-page invoices were insufficient.  Ex. 1, p. 8. 
Med-Plus provided hundreds of pages of back-up documentation with most
invoices, but it failed to do so for select months.   Ex. 1,
p. 8.  The court held that the lack of
backup detail did not render the damages for those months unascertainable.  June 2023 Decision at 9.  
            However, section 3.5a of the
Agreement allows Defendants to dispute any of the patient days, skilled care,
non-covered products, or supplies and quantity on an invoice within 30 days of
its billing date.  Ex. 1, p. 9.  This implies that Med-Plus was required to
provide sufficient information to enable Defendants to review individual
charges.  Ex. 1, p. 9.  The one-page summary of costs by category provided
by Med-Plus was insufficient for such review. 
Ex. 1, p. 9.  Because invoices for
any month that Med-Plus did not provide supporting pages never became due,
these damages were unascertainable.  Ex.
1, p. 9.  
            Defendants also argued that they were
entitled to offset based on the rebates Med-Plus had misappropriated.  June 2023 Decision at 7.  The court noted that an offset claim must be supported
by sufficient evidence to prove a prima facie case of attachment.  Ex. 1, p. 7.  Because Defendants offered no evidence as to
the value of the rebates, they could not use them to offset the amount subject
to attachment.  Ex. 1, p. 7.  
            As to probability of success on the
merits, Defendants argued Med-Plus failed to provide proof that they received
the invoices at issue.  Ex. 1, p. 10.  However, Anaheim and Bartlett both stated
that Med-Plus prepared invoices every month that reflected the goods and
services it provided.  Ex. 1, p. 10.  Defendants admitted to receipt of these
invoices every month, albeit sometimes without the usual backup documentation.  Ex. 1, p. 10. 
Med-Plus had therefore demonstrated a probability of success on the
merits.
 
            E. Analysis
            Plaintiff
Med-Plus applies for right to attach orders against Defendant Community for
$297,542.88 and Villa Rancho for $499,980.48.
 
            1.
A Claim Based on a Contract and on Which Attachment May Be Based 
            A
writ of attachment may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for
money, each of which is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the
total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount
not less than five hundred dollars ($500).  CCP §483.010(a).  
            Med-Plus’s
claims are for breach of contract based on the Agreements with Community and Villa
Rancho.  Farage Community Decl., ¶4, Ex.
A; Farage Villa Rancho Decl., ¶4, Ex. A. 
The contract claims are claims on which attachment may be based. 
             
            2.
An Amount Due That is Fixed and Readily Ascertainable  
            A
claim is “readily ascertainable” where the damages may be readily ascertained
by reference to the contract and the basis of the calculation appears to be
reasonable and definite.  CIT, supra, 115 Cal.App.4th at
540-41.  The fact that the damages are unliquidated is not
determinative.  Id.  But the contract must furnish a standard
by which the amount may be ascertained and there must be a basis by which the
damages can be determined by proof.  Id. (citations omitted). 
            Community’s invoices show that the net amount due for
services rendered was $35,405.82 in
February 2022, $29,453.40 in March 2022, $45,233.07 in April 2022, $37,518.03
in May 2022, $54,100.03 in June 2022, $49,038.13 in July 2022, and $47,381.42
in August 2022.  Farage Community Decl.,
¶8, Ex. C.  
            Villa Rancho’s invoices show that
the amount due for services rendered was $90,392.13 in February 2022,
$85,468.02 in March 2022, $57,548.30 in April 2022, $61,014.12 in May 2022,
$68,906.18 in June 2022, $70,369.36 in July 2022, and $66,453.35 in August
2022.  Farage Villa Rancho Decl., ¶8, Ex.
C.   
            The amount owed by Community under
the invoices totals $35,405.82 +
$29,453.40 + $45,233.07 + $37,518.03 + $54,100.03 + $49,038.13 + $47,381.42 =
$298,119.90.  The amount owed by Villa
Rancho under the invoices totals $90,392.13 + $85,468.02 + $57,548.30 +
$61,014.12 + $68,906.18 + $70,369.36 + $66,453.35 = $500,151.46.  
Med-Plus asserts that after credits, the total amount
owed is $297,542.88 for Community and $499,980.48 for Villa Rancho.  Farage Community Decl., ¶8; Farage Villa
Rancho Decl., ¶8.  
 
            Lack
of Invoice Backup Detail
            The
invoices Med-Plus provides include only one page of expenses by category.  Farage
Community Decl., Ex. C; Farage Villa Rancho Decl., Ex. C.  Med-Plus states that the invoices it
sent to Defendants included patient
names, prescription numbers, and descriptions of specific medications and
products ultimately furnished to patients. 
Farage Decl., ¶7.  Defendants respond that, although Med-Plus usually provided
this information, it failed to do so for Community’s August 2022 invoice
and for Villa Rancho’s invoices from March through August 2022.  Mader Decl., ¶3; Rhead Decl., ¶3.  Med-Plus fails to provide any evidence refuting
this.
            Section
3.5a of the Agreement allows Defendants to dispute any of the patient days,
skilled care, non-covered products, or supplies and quantity on an invoice
within 30 days of its billing date. 
Farage Community Decl., ¶¶ 4, 8, Ex. A; Farage Villa Rancho Decl., ¶¶ 4,
8, Ex. A.  This implies that Med-Plus
needed to provide sufficient information to enable Defendants to review the
charges.  While the hundreds of pages
Med-Plus usually sent might provide that, the one-page summary does not.  This court previously ruled for Med-Plus’s
right to attach applications against Defendants Anaheim and Bartlett that an
invoice never became due if Med-Plus failed to provide the supporting
pages.  Brucker Decl., Ex. 1, p. 9.  The same ruling applies here.
            The damages
sought for Community’s August 2022 invoice and Villa Rancho’s invoices from
March through August 2022 are disallowed for purposes of attachment.  The readily ascertainable damages are $250,161.46
for Community ($297,542.88 - $47,381.42) and $90,221.15 for Villa Rancho ($499,980.48
- ($85,468.02 + $57,548.30 + $61,014.12 + $68,906.18 + $70,369.36 + $66,453.35).
 
            3.
Probability of Success 
            A
claim has “probable validity” where it is more likely than not that the
plaintiff will recover on that claim.  CCP §481.190.  In determining
this issue, the court must consider the relative merits of the positions of the
respective parties.  Kemp, supra, 146 Cal.App.4th at
1484.  The court does not determine whether the claim is actually valid;
that determination will be made at trial and is not affected by the decision on
the application for the order.  CCP §484.050(b). 
            Under
the Agreements, payment for Med-Plus’s services was due 90 days after a
Defendant received an invoice for those services.  Farage Community Decl., ¶¶ 4, 8, Ex. A;
Farage Villa Rancho Decl., ¶¶ 4, 8, Ex. A. 
Farage asserts that he oversaw the preparation of invoices for
Defendants, whom Med-Plus billed monthly. 
Farage Decl., ¶7.  Under his
supervision, Med-Plus employees prepared the invoices and transmitted them by
email.  Farage Decl., ¶7.  Despite this, neither Community nor Villa
Rancho paid any of Med-Plus’ invoices from February to August 2022.  Farage Decl., ¶8.
 
            Implied
Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing
            On May 13, 2022, Sun
Mar asked if Med-Plus had filed for rebates in Sun Mar’s stead.  Dehghanmanesh Decl., ¶10, Ex. 1.  In July 2022, Sun Mar said it was ready to
pay some of the invoices but refused to do so until the rebate issue was
resolved.  Dehghanmanesh Decl., ¶11, Ex.
2.  On July 21, 2022, Dehghanmanesh again
told Med-Plus that Sun Mar’s medication claims for the first five months of
2022 had been rejected as duplicates. 
Dehghanmanesh Decl., ¶10, Ex. 1. 
Empirian Health, the company that submitted these claims for Sun Mar,
had confirmed Med-Plus was submitting those claims.  Dehghanmanesh Decl., ¶10, Ex. 1.  Dehghanmanesh attached a few examples of
duplicate claims from January through March 2022.  Dehghanmanesh Decl., ¶10, Ex. 1.  
            The
court previously held Defendants could not use the rebates to offset the amount
subject to attachment without evidence as to their value.  Mem. at 8; Brucker Decl., Ex. 1, p. 7.  A defendant may raise a claim of offset for
any indebtedness of the plaintiff to the defendant raised in a cross-complaint
or affirmative defense in an answer.  CCP
§483.015(b)(2), (3).  The defendant’s
offset claim under CCP section 483.015(b)(2) or (3) must be supported by
sufficient evidence to prove a prima facie case of attachment in its own
right. Lydig Construction, Inc. v. Martinez Steel, (“Lydig”)
(2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 937, 945; Pos-A-Traction, Inc. v. Kelly Springfield,
(C.D. Cal. 1999) 112 F.Supp.2d 1178, 1183.
To avoid this
valuation problem, Defendants argue that part of the Agreement’s benefits included
Sun Mar’s ability to claim rebates by buying pharmaceutical goods in bulk.  Opp. at 6; Dehghanmanesh
Decl., ¶2.  When Med-Plus claimed
the rebates for itself, it deprived Defendants of one benefit of the Agreement
which breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair
dealing.  Opp. at 6-7.
            To establish
a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, the non-breaching
party must show: (1) a contract between the parties; (2) the non-breaching
party fulfilled all obligations under the contract; (3) any conditions
precedent for the breaching party’s performance occurred or were excused; (4)
the breaching party did not act fairly or in good faith and prevented plaintiff
from receiving the benefits of the contract; and (5) the non-breaching party
was harmed.  Herskowitz v. Apple Inc., (N.D. Cal. 2013) 940
F.Supp.2d 1131. 
The breach of the implied
covenant is a breach of contract.  Under Alder
v. Drudis, (1947) 30 Cal. 2d 372, 381-82. 
After the other party’s breach of contract, the offended party may
choose to treat the breach as a repudiation ending the contract and sue for the
profits he would have realized if he had not been prevented from
performing.  Defendants contend that Med-Plus’s
breach excused Defendants from having to pay under the Agreement.  Opp. at 7.
            This
argument is dependent in part on whether Defendants performed their own obligations
under the Agreement.  See Herskowitz v. Apple Inc., supra,
940 F.Supp.2d at 1131.  As Med-Plus has attachment claims of $250,161.46
for Community and $90,221.15 for Villa Rancho that are fully supported by
invoice backup detail, it appears that Defendants cannot do so.  Additionally, Defendants do not fully support
their right to the rebates.  While
Defendants certainly are aided by the parties’ practice of allowing Defendants
to receive the rebates, this is not sufficient. 
As Med-Plus argues (Reply at 4-5), Defendants fail to present any
contractual right to the rebates.  The
implied covenant is limited to assuring compliance with the express terms of
the contract and cannot be extended to create new obligations.  Gibson v. Government Employees Ins. Co.,
(1984) 162 Cal.App.3d 441, 448.  In
addition, Defendants fail to present evidence of the pharmaceutical
manufacturer’s rebate offer and to whom it applies, as well any law pertaining
to rebates.  Finally, Defendants fail to show that Med-Plus actually took the
rebates for itself.  Reply at 7.
Defendants may prevail in
whole or in part at trial on the rebate issue. 
However, they fail to
demonstrate a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing that would
permit termination of their Agreements and obviate attachment.  Med-Plus has demonstrated a probability of
success on the merits.
 
            4.
Attachment Sought for a Proper Purpose¿ 
            Attachment
must not be sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon
which attachment is based.¿ CCP §484.090(a)(3). 
Med-Plus seeks attachment for a proper purpose.[4]
 
            E. Conclusion
            The
applications for right to attach orders are granted in the amount of
$250,161.46 for Community and $90,221.15 for Villa Rancho.  Med-Plus has failed to submit proposed right
to attach orders and must do so within two court days or it will be
waived.  
            No writ shall issue for either
Defendant until Med-Plus files an undertaking for each.  The
undertaking ordinarily is $10,000. CCP §489.220.  If the defendant objects, the court may
increase the amount of undertaking to the amount determined as the probable
recovery for wrongful attachment.  CCP
§489.220.  Defendants request that the undertaking be $1,000,000 per
Defendant.  They assert that because a
writ of attachment could lead to the closure of the nursing facilities, the
damages from wrongful attachment are in the millions.  Opp. at 9. 

Defendants
misunderstand the undertaking required by CCP section 489.220, which is an
undertaking protecting a defendant from the damages of a wrongful
attachment.  Such damages generally consist
of the loss of bank interest for attached funds and the attorney fees necessary
to set the attachment aside, not speculative consequential damages from lost
use of funds.   Defendants provide no
evidence on the proper issues.  Nor do
they provide evidence that Community and Villa Rancho are in such a risky
financial position that attachment of $250,161.46 for Community
and $90,221.15 for Villa Rancho would lead to their shutdown.  The undertaking is $10,000 for
each Defendant.
