            [1] Smith
seeks judicial notice of (1) the Board’s August 11, 2022 decision (“2022
Decision”) made after Smith I vacated the 2020 decision (Rifat Decl.,
¶4, Ex. A); (2) Judge Beckloff’s final decision in Smith I, dated
February 28, 2022 (Rifat Decl., ¶5, Ex. B); (3) the peremptory writ of mandate issued
in Smith I on February 28, 2022 (Rifat Decl., ¶6, Ex. C); and (4) the Board’s
return to the peremptory writ of mandamus in Smith I, dated June 9, 2022
(Rifat Decl., ¶7, Ex. D).  In reply,
Smith seeks judicial notice of (1) the proposed judgment in Smith v. Medical
Board of California, (“Smith II”), Case No. 22STCP03155 (Rifat Supp.
Decl., ¶3, Ex. E); and (2) a transcript of proceedings before the Board on July
22, 2022 that was part of the administrative record in Smith II (Rifat
Supp. Decl., ¶4, Ex. F).  
            The requests to judicially notice
Exhibits A-E are granted.  Evid. Code §§
452 (c)-(d).  The request to judicially
notice Exhibit F is denied.  The hearing
transcript from the administrative record in Smith II is not an official
act of the legislative, executive, or judicial department of the state and is
not part of the record for this action.  


[2]
As used in the Medical Practice Act, the Division of Medical Quality refers to
the Board.  B&P Code §2002.


[3]
The 2022 Decision reduced to two the number of patients considered for the 2019
Accusation.


[4]
Patient A testified that a UCSD pain medicine physician said that she had
enough fentanyl in her intrathecal therapy pump to “kill all the people in the
emergency room.” AR 11082.


[5] The Board’s opposition distinguishes Conant
as a case concerning a federal enforcement policy under which a doctor’s
controlled substances registration could be revoked if he or she recommended
medical marijuana to a patient.  Smith’s
probation condition proscribes his medical advice to another medical provider,
which is entirely different.  Opp. at
14-15.


[6]
Smith also is prohibited from
performing any patient treatment involving the use, management, or surgical
procedure related to intrathecal pumps. 
AR 9859-860.  This term is not at
issue in Smith’s First Amendment argument. 



[7] The
Board argues without evidence that it was unaware of these dangerous
sub-standard practices when it imposed its disciplinary penalty in the 2020
Decision.  Not until the hearing on the
2020 Accusation, including Smith’s
defense of the case, did the Board have a full understanding of the
serious deficiencies in Smith’s practice of intrathecal therapy.  Opp. at 17.
