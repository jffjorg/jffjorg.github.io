English-text summary:

The tentative decision denies the plaintiff's application for a right to attach order against the defendants. The plaintiff, Alex Nerush, seeks to attach orders to secure a debt of $59,000,000 owed by Naum Shekhter. The defendants are Naum, his wife Margarita, 2156 Stratford, LLC, and the NMS Family Living Trust. The case involves a dispute over loans and investments made by Naum to Nerush. Naum failed to document the loans and investments, and Nerush seeks to attach orders to secure the debt. The court finds that the plaintiff's application is procedurally defective and denies it.
