And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving Med-Plus and Sun Mar. The judge has overruled all of the defendant's written objections to a declaration made by Farage. Med-Plus had requested judicial notice of all prior pleadings and records in the action, but failed to make this request in a separate document and also failed to file a copy of the material for which it sought judicial notice. The judge notes that it is always free to review prior filings in the action, and therefore does not need to take judicial notice of a document in the court file.

The judge also notes that most, but not all, of Med-Plus's written evidentiary objections are overruled. The clerk is directed to scan and electronically file the court's rulings.

The defendant claimed an exemption from attachment due to senior liens on their property and receivables, but failed to discuss this issue in their memorandum. The judge notes that a senior lien is not a statutory exemption and does not prevent attachment.
