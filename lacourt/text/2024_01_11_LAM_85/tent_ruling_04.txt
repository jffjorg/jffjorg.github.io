            [1] All of
Defendants’ written objections to the Farage declaration are overruled.  In its supporting memoranda, Med-Plus
requests judicial notice of all prior pleadings and records in this
action.  Mem. at 4, n. 1.  Med-Plus failed to make this request in a
separate document.  CRC 3.1113(l).  It also failed to file a copy of the material
for which it sought judicial notice.  CRC
3.1306(c).  In any event, the court need
not judicially notice a document in the court file of the case at hand because
it is always free to review prior filings in the action.


            [2] If not
otherwise specified, the cited evidence is common to both applications.


            [3] Sun
Mar Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) Adrian Dehghanmanesh (“Dehghanmanesh”)
submits three declarations in support of the opposition.  The opposition only cites to a Dehghanmanesh
declaration filed “in Support of Defendants’ Joint Opposition.”  Opp. at 2-3, 6.  Unless otherwise stated, citations to “Dehghanmanesh
Decl.” are to this declaration.  The
other two declarations include UCC filings for each Defendant.  Dehghanmanesh Community Decl., Exs. 1-2; Dehghanmanesh
Villa Rancho Decl., Ex. 1.  Defendants do
not explain the relevance of these documents, but they apparently concern lien
priority.
            Most, but not all, of Med-Plus’s written evidentiary
objections are overruled.  The clerk is
directed to scan and electronically file the court’s rulings.

Although Defendants claim an exemption and provide evidence that their property
and receivables are subject to senior liens, they fail to discuss the issue in
their memorandum.  Additionally, a senior
lien is not a statutory exemption and does not prevent attachment.
