And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Smith's requests to judicially notice various documents and events, including the Board's August 2022 decision, Judge Beckloff's final decision in Smith I, the peremptory writ of mandate issued in Smith I, and the Board's return to the peremptory writ of mandamus in Smith I. However, the judge has denied Smith's request to judicially notice a transcript of proceedings before the Board on July 22, 2022, as it is not an official act of the state and is not part of the record for this action.

The judge has also noted that the Board's opposition distinguished a previous case, Conant, as it concerned a federal enforcement policy, whereas Smith's probation condition prohibits him from providing medical advice to another medical provider, which is a different scenario.

Additionally, the judge has pointed out that the Board's argument that it was unaware of Smith's dangerous practices when it imposed its disciplinary penalty in 2020 is unsupported by evidence.
