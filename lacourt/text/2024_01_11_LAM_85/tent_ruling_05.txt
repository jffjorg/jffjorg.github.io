Alex Nerush v. Naum Shekhter
et al, 23STCV23854
Tentative decision on applications
for right to attach orders: denied




 
            
            
            Plaintiff
Alex Nerush (“Nerush”) applies for right to attach orders against Defendants Naum
Shekhter (“Naum”), Margarita Shekhter (“Margarita”), 2156 Stratford, LLC, a
California limited liability company (“Stratford CA”), and Naum and Margarita as
trustees of the NMS Family Living Trust (“Trust”) in the amount of $59,000,000.

            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, oppositions, and combined
reply,[1] and
renders the following tentative decision. 
 
            A. Statement of the Case
            1.
Complaint
            Plaintiff
Nerush commenced this action on September 29, 2023 against Defendants Naum and
Margarita, individually and as trustees of the Trust, Vera Shekhter (“Vera”),
Adam Shekhter (“Adam”), Alan Shekhter (“Alan”), Alexander Shekhter (“Alexander”),
NMS Properties, Inc. (“NMS”), WS Communities, LLC (“WS”), and Stratford CA.  The verified Complaint alleges breach of
contract, common count for money lent, and fraudulent conveyances in pertinent
part as follows.
            Naum
is a successful real estate developer.  Naum
and Nerush are half-brothers.  Vera is
Naum’s mother.  Adam, Alan, and Alexander
are Naum and Margarita’s children.  
            In
2009, Naum began asking Nerush to loan him money to support investments in
various real estate projects.  Between
August 2009 and October 2010, Nerush loaned Naum $8,995,000 (“Initial Loans”).  Naum prepared and drafted promissory notes
for these loans but never executed them.
            Naum
then solicited Nerush to invest in various projects.  From December 2010 to December 2014, Nerush
invested $19,000,000 (“Investments”).  Naum
never documented Nerush’s Investments.
            In
2016, Naum offered to convert Nerush’s Initial Loans and Investments into a
single loan due and payable in five years. 
As of May 1, 2016, Naum acknowledged in writing that he owed Nerush
$55,000,000 in loans, Investments (now “Additional Loans”), and interest.  In May 2016, Naum provided a draft of an Amended  and 
Restated  Master Promissory Note (“Amended
Note”).  This Amended Note listed Initial
Loans of $8,995,000.  Naum later provided
a summary of all loans showing that as of December 6, 2014, the loans total $28,552,380.31
plus accrued interest.
            The
parties never executed the Amended Note. 
On April 25, 2016, Naum emailed Nerush that beginning May 1, 2016, the
total loan would be $55,248,000 with compound interest at a 10% rate.  The principal and accrued interest would be
payable on April 30, 2021, subject to an option to extend for an additional
five years.  If Naum exercised this
option, the compound interest rate during the additional five years would be
12%.  Naum would use his interest in his
partnership to secure this loan.
            Nerush
never agreed to the five-year extension. 
He never received the security Naum promised him.  As of February 2021, Naum had not paid
anything on the loan.  After Nerush
complained, Naum agreed to start paying off the loan in monthly installments.  From February 2021 to October 2022, Naum paid
Nerush $3,100,000.  Naum still owes over
$100,000,000.
            Naum
transferred portions of the investments to the other Defendants without
consideration in exchange.  These
transfers were an attempt to prevent Nerush from collecting on Naum’s debt.
            Nerush
seeks $100,000,000 in compensatory damages, nullification of any transfers or
conveyances from Naum to the other Defendants as necessary to satisfy Nerush’s
claims, and costs of suit.
 
            2.
Course of Proceedings
            On November 22, 2023,
Nerush served Naum, individually and as trustee of the Trust, Vera, and
Margarita with the Complaint, Summons, and moving papers by substitute service,
effective December 2, 2023.  Nerush also
personally served Stratford CA and NMS with these documents.
            On January 3, 2024,
Department 57 (Hon. Michael Small) rejected requests for entry of default as to
Naum, Stratford CA, NMS, and Margarita because the names on the declarations of
mailing did not match the names on the Summons and Complaint.  Department 57 did enter default judgment as
to Vera.
 
            B.
Applicable Law
            Attachment
is a prejudgment remedy providing for the seizure of one or more of the
defendant’s assets to aid in the collection of a money demand pending the
outcome of the trial of the action.  See
Whitehouse v. Six Corporation, (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 527, 533.  In 1972, and in a 1977 comprehensive
revision, the Legislature enacted attachment legislation (CCP §481.010 et
seq.) that meets the due process requirements set forth in Randone v.
Appellate Department, (1971) 5 Cal.3d 536. 
See Western Steel & Ship Repair v. RMI, (12986) 176
Cal.App.3d 1108, 1115.  As the attachment
statutes are purely the creation of the Legislature, they are strictly
construed.  Vershbow v. Reiner,
(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 879, 882.




            A
writ of attachment may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for
money, each of which is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the
total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount
not less than five hundred dollars ($500). 
CCP §483.010(a).  A claim is
“readily ascertainable” where the amount due may be clearly ascertained from
the contract and calculated by evidence; the fact that damages are unliquidated
is not determinative.  CIT
Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v. Super DVD, Inc., (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th
537, 540-41 (attachment appropriate for claim based on rent calculation for
lease of commercial equipment).
            All
property within California of a corporation, association, or partnership is
subject to attachment if there is a method of levy for the property.  CCP §487.010(a), (b).  While a trustee is a natural person, a trust
is not.  Therefore, a trust’s property is
subject to attachment on the same basis as a corporation or partnership.  Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn &
Rossi v. Wilson, supra, 197 Cal.App.3d at 4.
            If
the action is against a defendant who is a natural person, an attachment may be
issued only on a commercial claim which arises out of the defendant’s conduct
of a trade, business, or profession.  CCP
§483.010(c).  Consumer transactions
cannot form a basis for attachment.   CCP
§483.010(c); Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn & Rossi v. Wilson,
(1987) 197 Cal.App.3d 1, 4 (action involving trust property was a commercial,
not a consumer, transaction).
            The
plaintiff may apply for a right to attach order by noticing a hearing for the
order and serving the defendant with summons and complaint, notice of the
application, and supporting papers any time after filing the complaint.  CCP §484.010. 
Notice of the application must be given pursuant to CCP section 1005,
sixteen court days before the hearing.  See
ibid.
            The
notice of the application and the application may be made on Judicial Council
forms (Optional Forms AT-105, 115).  The
application must be supported by an affidavit showing that the plaintiff on the
facts presented would be entitled to a judgment on the claim upon which the
attachment is based.  CCP §484.030.  
            Where
the defendant is a corporation, a general reference to “all corporate property
which is subject to attachment pursuant to subdivision (a) of Code of Civil
Procedure Section 487.010” is sufficient. 
CCP §484.020(e).  Where the
defendant is a partnership or other unincorporated association, a reference to
“all property of the partnership or other unincorporated association which is
subject to attachment pursuant to subdivision (b) of Code of Civil Procedure
Section 487.010” is sufficient.  CCP
§484.020(e).  A specific description of
property is not required for corporations and partnerships as they generally
have no exempt property.  Bank of
America v. Salinas Nissan, Inc., (“Bank of America”) (1989) 207
Cal.App.3d 260, 268.
            Where
the defendant is a natural person, the description of the property must be
reasonably adequate to permit the defendant to identify the specific property
sought to be attached.  CCP §484.020(e).  Although the property must be specifically
described, the plaintiff may target for attachment everything the individual
defendant owns.  Bank of America v.
Salinas Nissan, Inc., (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 268.
            A
defendant who opposes issuance of the order must file and serve a notice of
opposition and supporting affidavit as required by CCP section 484.060 not
later than five court days prior to the date set for hearing.  CCP §484.050(e).  The notice of opposition may be made on a
Judicial Council form (Optional Form AT-155). 

            The
plaintiff may file and serve a reply two court days prior to the date set for
the hearing.  CCP §484.060(c). 
            At
the hearing, the court determines whether the plaintiff should receive a right
to attach order and whether any property which the plaintiff seeks to attach is
exempt from attachment.  The defendant
may appear the hearing.  CCP
§484.050(h).  The court generally will
evaluate the attachment application based solely on the pleadings and
supporting affidavits without taking additional evidence.  Bank of America, supra, 207
Cal.App.3d at 273. A verified complaint may be used in lieu of or in addition
to an affidavit if it states evidentiary facts. 
CCP §482.040.  The plaintiff has
the burden of proof, and the court is not required to accept as true any
affidavit even if it is undisputed.  See
Bank of America, supra, at 271, 273.



            The
court may issue a right to attach order (Optional Form AT-120) if the plaintiff
shows all of the following: (1) the claim on which the attachment is based is
one on which an attachment may be issued (CCP §484.090(a)(1)); (2) the
plaintiff has established the probable validity of the claim (CCP
§484.090(a)(2)); (3) attachment is sought for no purpose other than the
recovery on the subject claim (CCP §484.090(a)(3); and (4) the amount to be
secured by the attachment is greater than zero (CCP §484.090(a)(4)). 
            A
claim has “probable validity” where it is more likely than not that the
plaintiff will recover on that claim. 
CCP §481.190.  In determining this
issue, the court must consider the relative merits of the positions of the
respective parties.  Kemp Bros.
Construction, Inc. v. Titan Electric Corp., (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1474,
1484.  The court does not determine
whether the claim is actually valid; that determination will be made at trial
and is not affected by the decision on the application for the order.  CCP §484.050(b).
            Except
in unlawful detainer actions, the amount to be secured by the attachment is the
sum of (1) the amount of the defendant’s indebtedness claimed by the plaintiff,
and (2) any additional amount included by the court for estimate of costs and
any allowable attorneys’ fees under CCP section 482.110.  CCP §483.015(a); Goldstein v. Barak
Construction, (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 845, 852.  This amount must be reduced by the sum of (1)
the amount of indebtedness that the defendant has in a money judgment against
plaintiff, (2) the amount claimed in a cross-complaint or affirmative defense
and shown would be subject to attachment against the plaintiff, and (3) the
value of any security interest held by the plaintiff in the defendant’s
property, together with the amount by which the acts of the plaintiff (or a
prior holder of the security interest) have decreased that security interest’s
value.  CCP §483.015(b).  A defendant claiming that the amount to be
secured should be reduced because of a cross-claim or affirmative defense must
make a prima facie showing that the claim would result in an attachment
against the plaintiff.
            Before
the issuance of a writ of attachment, the plaintiff is required to file an
undertaking to pay the defendant any amount the defendant may recover for any
wrongful attachment by the plaintiff in the action.  CCP §489.210. 
The undertaking ordinarily is $10,000. CCP §489.220.  If the defendant objects, the court may
increase the amount of undertaking to the amount determined as the probable
recovery for wrongful attachment.  CCP
§489.220.  The court also has inherent authority
to increase the amount of the undertaking sua sponte.  North Hollywood Marble Co. v. Superior
Court, (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 683, 691.

Statement of Facts
            1.
Nerush’s Evidence[2]
            a.
Loan History
            Real
estate developer Naum is Nerush’s half-brother. 
Nerush Decl., ¶2.  Naum has done
business over the last 30 years through various entities.  Nerush Decl., ¶2.  One of them is NMS, a corporation organized
under California law with its principal place of business in Los Angeles.  Nerush Decl., ¶2.  Naum is NMS’s founder and Chief Executive
Officer.  Nerush Decl., ¶2, Ex. 1.  Through NMS, Naum has developed numerous
multi-family residential real estate projects in Santa Monica and West Los
Angeles.  Nerush Decl., ¶3.
            In
2009, Naum began to solicit Nerush to support investment in various
projects.  Nerush Decl., ¶4.  Naum promised to document Nerush’s loans.  Nerush Decl., ¶4.  In reliance on these promises, Nerush loaned
Naum $8,995,000 between August 2009 and October 2010.  Nerush Decl., ¶4.  Naum drafted various promissory notes for
these Initial Loans, but they were never executed.  Nerush Decl., ¶4.  
            Beginning
December 2010, Naum solicited Nerush to invest in various projects with
Naum.  Nerush Decl., ¶5.  From December 2010 to December 2014, Nerush
invested $19,000,000.  Nerush Decl.,
¶5.  Naum never documented Nerush’s Investments
despite promises to do so.  Nerush Decl.,
¶5.  
            In
2016, Naum offered to convert Nerush’s Initial Loans and Investments into a
single loan payable in five years.  Nerush
Decl., ¶6.  On April 19, 2016, Naum
acknowledged in writing that he owed Nerush $55,000,000 in loans, investments,
and interest as of May 1, 2016.  Nerush
Decl., ¶6, Ex. 2.  
            In
May 2016, Naum provided a draft of an Amended Note identifying Naum as the
borrower.  Nerush Decl., ¶7, Ex. 3.  The recitals stated that Nerush had loaned
Naum a collective $8,995,000 in the various Initial Loans reflected in Schedule
1 to the Amended Note.  Nerush Decl., ¶7,
Ex. 3.  A Master Promissory Note dated
March 28, 2012 reflected those loans. 
Nerush Decl., ¶7, Ex. 3.  
The second recital asserted that Nerush made Additional Loans
as reflected in Schedule 2, but the aggregate amount of these loans remained
blank in the recital.  Nerush Decl., ¶7,
Ex. 3.
            The
third recital explained that Naum and Nerush now agreed to add the accrued and
unpaid interest on both the Initial and Additional Loans to the principal.  Nerush Decl., ¶7, Ex. 3.  However, the recital left blank the space for
accrued interest on the Initial and Additional Loans.  Nerush Decl., ¶7, Ex. 3.  
            Shortly
thereafter, Naum sent Nerush a summary of all the loans Nerush had made.  Nerush Decl., ¶8, Ex. 4.  This summary showed that the principal of the
Initial Loans totaled $8,995,000.  Nerush
Decl., ¶8, Ex. 4.  After a loan on
December 6, 2014, the principal of the Additional Loans totaled $19,557,380.31.  Nerush Decl., ¶8, Ex. 4.  The principal of all loans totaled $28,552,380.31.  Nerush Decl., ¶8.  
On April 25, 2016, Naum emailed Nerush that beginning May 1,
2016, the total loan balance would be $55,248,000 with compound interest at a
10% rate.  Nerush Decl., ¶9, Ex. 5.  The principal and accrued interest would be
payable on April 30, 2021, subject to an option to extend for an additional
five years.  Nerush Decl., ¶9, Ex.
5.  The compound interest rate during the
additional five years would increase to 12%. 
Nerush Decl., ¶9, Ex. 5.  The loan
would be secured by a partnership interest. 
Nerush Decl., ¶9, Ex. 5.  
            The
Amended Note was never executed because Nerush never agreed to the five-year
extension and because he never received any security for Naum’s obligations.  Nerush Decl., ¶10.  
            Nerush
complained to Naum about his failure to pay any of the amounts owed under the
loans.  Nerush Decl., ¶11.  On February 4, 2021, Naum emailed NMS Controller
Kurt Lietz instructions to wire $100,000 per month to Nerush, including a
$200,000 wire to reflect both January and February 2021.  Nerush Decl., ¶11, Ex. 6.  In accordance with his promise to begin
paying off the loans, Naum paid Nerush $3,100,000 from February 2021 to October
2022.  Nerush Decl., ¶12.
 
            b.
Damages
            Based
on a 10% interest rate, the $8,995,000 in Initial Loans has accrued $12,287,402
in interest as of October 11, 2023.  Nerush
Decl., ¶13.  Based on the same rate, the $19,557,380.31
in Additional Loans has accrued $34,135,281 in interest as of the same
date.  Nerush Decl., ¶13.  The sum of the principal and accrued interest
on all Loans totals $62,687,661.31.  Nerush
Decl., ¶13.  
            After
subtracting the $3,100,000 Naum repaid and the $540,535 in interest credits
based on these repayments, the outstanding balance totals $59,047,126.31.  Nerush Decl., ¶13.  This is conservative when compared to Naum’s April
2016 assertion that he owed Nerush $55,123,000. 
Nerush Decl., ¶13.  
 
            c.
Defendants’ Assets
            Naum
and Margarita live next door to Nerush at 2156 Stratford Circle, Los Angeles,
CA 90049 (“Residence”).  Nerush Decl.,
¶14.  Nerush estimates the value of the
Residence as between $15,000,000 and $25,000,000.  Nerush Decl., ¶14.  Naum has told Nerush about a current deed of
trust against the Residence in the approximate amount of $12,000,000.  Nerush Decl., ¶14.  
            In
2004, Margarita as Stratford CA’s manager executed a grant deed conveying the
Residence to 2156 Stratford, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
(“Stratford DE”).  Nerush Decl., ¶14, Ex.
7.  Stratford DE is the current
titleholder for the Residence.  Nerush
Decl., ¶14.  If the Residence is sold,
the funds from the sale in excess of the amount owed on the deed of trust
should be subject to a writ of attachment. 
Nerush Decl., ¶14.  It is the only
major asset in which Naum still has an interest.  Nerush Decl., ¶14.  
            Nerush
has personally seen that the Residence contains valuable art and
furnishings.  Nerush Decl., ¶15.  Naum and Margarita also both own expensive
watches, jewelry, and purses.  Nerush
Decl., ¶15.  
 
            2.
Defendants’ Evidence
            All
transactions relevant to this action were conducted by NMS, not by Naum in a
personal capacity.  Naum Decl., ¶3.  Naum communicated with Nerush about these investments
and loans solely on NMS’ behalf.  Naum
Decl., ¶4.  Naum always used his NMS email
address instead of his personal one to discuss the investments and loans with
Nerush.  Naum Decl., ¶4.  
            NMS
and Nerush never reached an agreement to convert the Investments to loans.  Naum Decl., ¶4.  Nerush and NMS have engaged in various
settlement discussions about the Investments at issue.  Naum Decl., ¶5.
            Stratford
CA holds title to the Residence and conducts no other business.  Margarita Decl., ¶3.  It acquired the Residence several years
before the Initial Loans and Investments. 
Margarita Decl., ¶3.  It did not
use a loan or investment from Nerush to make this acquisition.  Margarita Decl., ¶3.  Stratford CA has never procured a loan or
investment from Nerush.  Margarita Decl.,
¶3.  A $59 million writ of attachment
would cause irreparable damage to Stratford CA because it could not pay its
obligations to third parties.  Margarita
Decl., ¶4.
 
            D. Analysis
            Plaintiff
Nerush applies for right to attach orders against Naum, Margarita, Stratford CA,
and Naum and Margarita in their capacity as trustees of the Trust in the amount
of $59,000,000.
            An
application for a right to attach order is a law and motion matter.  CRC 3.1103(a)(2).  All law and motion matters require a
memorandum of points and authorities detailing the basis for the motion.  CRC 3.1113(a).  The absence of a memorandum may be construed
as an admission that the motion is not meritorious.  CRC 3.1113(a).
            Nerush
failed to file a supporting memorandum of points and authorities with its
applications.  It merely attached identical
declarations and exhibits to each one.  Nerush
also failed to file and serve a Notice of Application for a Right to Attach
Order for each Defendant that separately names that Defendant.   The applications are denied as procedurally
defective.
