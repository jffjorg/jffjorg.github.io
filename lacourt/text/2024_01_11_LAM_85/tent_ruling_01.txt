  Case Number:  22STCP00574    Hearing Date:   January 11, 2024    Dept:  85 
 
David James Smith, M.D.
v. Medical Board of California, 22STCP00574

Tentative decision on petition
for writ of mandate:   denied



 
 
 
            Petitioner
David James Smith, M.D. (“Smith”) seeks mandamus directing Respondent Medical
Board of California (“Board”) to set aside its disciplinary action against his license.  
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply, and
renders the following tentative decision. 
            
            A.
Statement of the Case
            1.
Petition
            Petitioner
Smith commenced this proceeding on February 17, 2022.  The operative pleading is the verified First
Amended Petition (“FAP”), filed on March 23, 2022, and alleging four
causes of action for administrative mandamus. 
The FAP alleges in pertinent part as follows.
            On
August 25, 2020, the Board issued a decision to discipline Smith’s license (“2020
Decision”), placing Smith on probation and prohibiting him from performing any
patient care or treatment involving intrathecal therapy until he completed a
Clinical Competence Assessment Program. 
Smith complied with the terms of this probation, and the Board again permitted
him to provide the intrathecal therapy modality.
            On
November 12, 2020, Smith filed a petition challenging the 2020 Decision in Smith
v. Board of California, (“Smith I”), Case No. 20STCP03757.  
On December 22, 2020, the Board filed another accusation against
Smith (“2020 Accusation”).  The 2020
Accusation concerned allegations virtually identical to those in the 2020
Decision.
            On
December 22, 2021, the Board issued a decision (“2021 Decision”) incorporating the
2020 Decision and adding to its discipline. 
The 2021 Decision was based on the same issues and period of medical
care as the 2020 Decision.  The 2021
Decision again placed Smith on probation, prohibited him from performing any
patient care or treatment involving intrathecal pumps, and from advising any
medical provider on such treatment, for the duration of his probation.  
            On
January 24, 2022, the court in Smith I set aside the 2020 Decision because
the Board had improperly excluded testimony from Smith’s expert on the standard
of care.  
            Smith
alleges that the 2021 Decision is void as a matter of law because Smith I
set aside the underlying 2020 Decision. 
It also was not based on clear and convincing evidence to a reasonable medical
certainty.   Further, the discipline imposed constitutes
administrative double jeopardy; Smith fully complied with the terms of his
probation under the 2020 Decision and there was no cause for further
discipline.  The prohibition on advising other
professionals on intrathecal therapy treatment also infringed Smith’s constitutional
right to free speech. 
            Additionally,
the 2021 Decision purports to resolve a dispute on the standard of care for
pain medicine which arose after Smith’s treatment of patients in this case.  The 2021 Decision also imposes opioid prescription
guidelines that are inapplicable to pain management specialists treating
patients suffering from chronic, intractable pain, and the Board engaged in
underground rulemaking when it adopted those guidelines as the standard of
care.
            Smith seeks (1) a writ of mandate vacating
the 2021 Decision; (2) a writ of mandate prohibiting the Board from imposing
prior restraint of professional speech on physicians when it does not satisfy a
compelling government interest by the least restrictive means; (3) a temporary
restraining order, preliminary injunction, and permanent injunction enjoining
the Board from imposing dosing guidelines, either directly or by disciplinary orders
related to intrathecal therapy; (4) a declaration that imposition of such
guidelines violates state law and regulations; (5) a stay of the 2021 Decision
pending the outcome of these proceedings; and (6) attorney’s fees and costs.
 
            2.
Course of Proceedings
            On
February 22, 2022, Smith served the Board with the Petition and Summons by
substitute service, effective March 4, 2022.
            On
March 23, 2022, Smith filed the FAP.  He subsequently
served the Board on March 25, 2022.
            On
May 17, 2022, the Board filed an Answer to the FAP.
            On
May 25, 2022, the court related this case to Smith I.
 
B. Standard of Review
            CCP
section 1094.5 is the administrative mandamus provision which structures the
procedure for judicial review of adjudicatory decisions rendered by
administrative agencies.  Topanga
Ass’n for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles, (“Topanga”)
(1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 514-15.  
            CCP
section 1094.5 does not in its face specify which cases are subject to
independent review, leaving that issue to the courts.  Fukuda v. City of Angels, (“Fukuda”)
(1999) 20 Cal.4th 805, 811.  In cases
reviewing decisions which affect a vested, fundamental right the trial court
exercises independent judgment on the evidence.  Bixby v. Pierno, (“Bixby”)
(1971) 4 Cal.3d 130, 143; see CCP
§1094.5(c).  An administrative decision imposing
discipline on a professional licensee is decided under the independent judgment
standard.  Griffiths v. Superior Court, (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 757,
767. 

            Under
the independent judgment test, “the trial court not only examines the
administrative record for errors of law but also exercises its independent
judgment upon the evidence disclosed in a limited trial de novo.”  Bixby, supra, 4 Cal.3d at 143.  The court must draw its own reasonable
inferences from the evidence and make its own credibility determinations.  Morrison v. Housing Authority of the City
of Los Angeles Board of Commissioners, (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 860,
868.  In short, the court substitutes its
judgment for the agency’s regarding the basic facts of what happened, when,
why, and the credibility of witnesses.  Guymon
v. Board of Accountancy, (1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 1010, 1013-16.
            “In
exercising its independent judgment, a trial court must afford a strong
presumption of correctness concerning the administrative findings, and the
party challenging the administrative decision bears the burden of convincing
the court that the administrative findings are contrary to the weight of the
evidence.”  Fukuda, supra, 20 Cal.4th at 817.  Unless it can be demonstrated by petitioner
that the agency’s actions are not grounded upon any reasonable basis in law or
any substantial basis in fact, the courts should not interfere with the
agency’s discretion or substitute their wisdom for that of the agency.  Bixby, supra, 4 Cal.3d 130, 150-51;
Bank of America v. State Water Resources Control Board, (1974) 42
Cal.App.3d 198, 208.
            The
agency’s decision must be based on the evidence presented at the hearing.  Board of Medical Quality Assurance v.
Superior Court, (1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 860, 862.  The hearing officer is only required to issue
findings that give enough explanation so that parties may determine whether,
and upon what basis, to review the decision. Topanga, supra, 11
Cal.3d 506, 514-15.  Implicit in section
1094.5 is a requirement that the agency set forth findings to bridge the
analytic gap between the raw evidence and ultimate decision or order.  Id. at 115.
            An
agency is presumed to have regularly performed its official duties (Evid. Code
§664), and the petitioner therefore has the burden of proof.  Steele v. Los Angeles County Civil Service
Commission, (1958) 166 Cal.App.2d 129, 137. 
“[T]he burden of proof falls upon the party attacking the administrative
decision to demonstrate wherein the proceedings were unfair, in excess of
jurisdiction or showed prejudicial abuse of discretion.  Afford v. Pierno, (1972) 27 Cal.App.3d
682, 691. 
The standard of proof in administrative proceeding is
relevant on mandamus review.  Li v. Superior Court (Sacramento County),
(2021) 69 Cal.App.5th 836, 844. 
Where the administrative burden of proof is clear and convincing
evidence, the trial court must account for that standard of proof when
exercising its independent judgment on the sufficiency of the evidence.  Id. at 865.   The trial court must apply the
principles of deference and presumptive correctness in the context of whether
the findings are supported by clear and convincing evidence rather than a mere
preponderance of the evidence.  Id.
            
            C. Governing Law[1]
            1. Medical
Practice Act
Protection of the public shall be the highest priority for
the Board, Division of Medical Quality,[2] Board
of Podiatric Medicine, and administrative law judges of the Medical Quality
Hearing Panel in exercising their disciplinary authority.  Business & Professions Code (“B&P
Code”) §§ 2001.1, 2229(a).  In exercising
such authority, an ALJ or the Division of Medical Quality shall, wherever
possible, take action that is calculated to aid in the rehabilitation of the
licensee, or where, due to a lack of continuing education or other reasons,
restriction on scope of practice is indicated, to order restrictions as are
indicated by the evidence.  B&P Code §2229(b).  
            The legislative intent
is for the Division of Medical Quality, Board of Podiatric Medicine, and enforcement
program to seek out licensees who have demonstrated deficiencies in competency
and take action.  B&P Code §2229(c).  Priority shall be given to the measures that
will remove those deficiencies, including further education, restrictions from
practice, and other means.  Id.  Where rehabilitation and protection are
inconsistent, protection shall be paramount. 
Id.
The Board shall take action against any licensee who is
charged with unprofessional conduct. 
Unprofessional conduct includes, but is not limited to, (b) gross negligence;
(c) repeated negligent acts, defined as two or more negligent acts or
omissions.  An initial negligent act or
omission followed by a separate and distinct departure from the applicable
standard of care shall constitute repeated negligent acts; (d) incompetence;
and (f) any action or conduct that would have warranted the denial of a certificate.  This subdivision shall only apply to a
certificate holder who is the subject of an investigation by the Board.  B&P Code §2234.
The object of Board
discipline is not to punish the physician, but to protect the life, health, and
welfare of the people at large and set up a plan whereby those who practice
medicine will have the qualifications which will prevent, as far as possible,
the evils which could result.  Pirouzian
v. Superior Court, (2016) 1 Cal. App. 5th 438, 446.  In other words, the purpose of discipline is
to make the physician a better physician. 
Id.
                                     
            D. Statement of Facts
            1. The 2019 Accusation
            On April 27, 2018, the Board’s
Executive Director (“Complainant”) filed an Accusation against Smith.  AR 8467. 
The Complainant filed a First Amended Accusation on February 13,
2019.  AR 3144.  (The Accusation and First Amended Accusation
are collectively referred to herein as the “2019 Accusation”.)
            The 2019 Accusation
alleged Smith had initiated excessive doses of pain medication via both
intrathecal pump and high dose systemic oral opioid drug therapy for five
patients.  AR 3148.  The 2019 Accusation alleged in part that, on
October 9, 2012, Smith initiated an excessive dose of fentanyl for Patient A.  AR 3151. 
He failed to initiate intrathecal therapy in an inpatient or outpatient
setting to observe whether Patient A had a safe response to the
medication.  AR 3151-52.  Smith also failed to properly program
medication information into Patient A's intrathecal pump, including the
starting and final concentration of medication and other reported values of
concentration and doses.  AR 3152.  The 2019 Accusation made allegations of
excessive pain medicant for Patients B-E, none of which involved intrathecal
therapy.  AR 3153-162.
            
a. The 2020 Decision
On June 25, 2020, ALJ
Vallera Johnson issued a 100-page proposed decision after an administrative
hearing on the 2019 Accusation.  AR 3302-401.  The ALJ’s proposed decision discussed Patient
A’s care from May 2011 to 2017 (AR 3316), Patient B’s care from May 2011 to
November 2013 (AR 3338), Patient C’s care from May 2011 to June 2012 (AR 3363),
Patient D’s care from December 2011 to July 2021 (AR 3369), and Patient E’s
care from April to October 2013 (AR 3375). 

            Based on his misconduct with
these five patients, the ALJ’s proposed decision revoked Smith’s license,
stayed the revocation, and placed Smith on a seven-year probation subject to
certain terms and conditions.  AR 3388-401.  The conditions included enrollment in a Clinical
Competence Assessment Program approved in advance by the Board or its
designee.  AR 3909.  Smith was required to complete the program
within six months of enrollment unless the Board or its designee agreed to an
extension.  AR 3909.  Until Smith provided the Board with proof of
completion of the program, he could not order, prescribe, dispense, administer,
furnish, or possess Schedule II-IV drugs. 
AR 3910.  He also could not
perform any care or treatment with patients involving the use, management, or
any surgical procedures related to intrathecal pumps.  AR 3910. 

            On August 25, 2020, the Board
adopted the proposed decision as the 2020 Decision, effective September 24,
2020.  AR 3818.  
 
            b. Smith I
            On November 19, 2020,
Smith filed a petition for a writ of mandate to compel the Board to set aside
the 2020 Decision.  Rifat Decl., ¶6, Ex.
C.  On January 24, 2022, Judge Beckloff
issued a final decision granting the petition in Smith I on fair trial
grounds with respect to three patients. 
Rifat Decl., ¶7, Ex. D, pp. 5-19. 
The court set aside the 2020 Decision but noted that nothing in its
decision would limit or control the discretion legally vested in the
Board.  Rifat Decl., ¶7, Ex. D.  
            On February 28, 2022,
Judge Beckloff entered judgment in Smith I.  Rifat Decl., ¶5, Ex. B.  The Board’s proposed judgment would have set
aside the 2020 Decision without prejudice and remanded the matter to the Board
for reconsideration pursuant to CCP section 1094.5(f).  Rifat Decl., ¶5, Ex. B.  The court struck language from the proposed
judgment including “without prejudice” and the reference to remand and reconsideration
by the Board, with the note “Objections considered.”  Rifat Decl., ¶5, Ex. B.  On April 18, 2022, the clerk issued a writ of
mandate compelling the Board to set aside the 2020 Decision.  Rifat Decl., ¶6, Ex. C.
            On June 9, 2022, the
Board filed and served a return to the writ in Smith I.  Rifat Decl., ¶7, Ex. D.  The return included a Board order issued
earlier that day which vacated and set aside the 2020 Decision.  Rifat Decl., ¶7, Ex. D, p. 4.   The order stated that the Board would
reconsider Smith’s case on July 22, 2022 in a manner consistent with the Smith
I decision.  Rifat Decl., ¶7, Ex. D,
p. 4.
 
            c.
The 2022 Decision
            On
August 11, 2022, the Board issued the 2022 Decision, retroactively effective from
September 24, 2020.  Rifat Decl., ¶4, Ex.
A, pp. 2-98.  The 2022 Decision is
entitled “Decision after Superior Court Remand.”  Rifat Decl., ¶4, Ex. A, p. 2.  The Board reviewed the record and the court’s
decision in Smith I before issuing the 2022 Decision.  Rifat Decl., ¶4, Ex. A, p. 4.  The 2022 Decision revoked Smith’s license,
stayed the revocation, and placed him on probation for five years retroactive
to September 24, 2020.  Rifat Decl., ¶4,
Ex. A, p. 86.  The probation was subject
to the same terms and conditions as the 2020 Decision.  Rifat Decl., ¶4, Ex. A, pp. 86-98.  Smith would receive full credit for the period
of probation already served and for any term of probation satisfied before Smith
I was remanded to the Board.  Rifat
Decl., ¶4, Ex. A, p. 86.  The 2022
Decision attached the 2020 Decision.  Rifat
Decl., ¶4, Ex. A, pp. 101-201.  
 
            d.
Smith II
            On
August 26, 2022, Smith filed a petition for a writ of mandate to compel the
Board to set aside the 2022 Decision.  Rifat
Supp. Decl., ¶3, Ex. E.  On
December 12, 2023, this court denied the petition in Smith II.  Rifat Supp. Decl., ¶3, Ex. E.  The court concluded in part that the Board’s
June 2022 order to consider the appropriate penalty was a non-adoption of the
ALJ’s proposed penalty for the 2020 Decision. 
Rifat Supp. Decl., ¶3, Ex. E, p. 15. 
It was not a reconsideration of the penalty, but an initial consideration
of the penalty after such non-adoption.  Rifat
Supp. Decl., ¶3, Ex. E, p. 15.  
 
2. The 2020
Accusation
            On December 22, 2020,
the Complainant filed the 2020 Accusation against Smith’s license.  AR 12, 39. 
The 2020 Accusation alleged gross negligence as to Patient A based on
treatment in 2016, Patient B based on treatment in 2015, and C based on
treatment in 2018.  AR 19, 27, 34.
            ALJ Abraham Levy heard
the matter in October 2021.  Pertinent
testimony is as follows.
 
            a. Mark Wallace, M.D.
            Mark
Wallace, M.D. (“Wallace”) testified as a Board expert.  He has reviewed ten cases for the Board in
the past 20 years.  AR 10034.  The standard of care is how a reasonable and
prudent physician would provide care, based on their knowledge and skill in the
time period in question.  AR 10034-35. 
 
            (1).
Programming the Intrathecal Pump 
            Failure
to program a pump to correctly reflect the concentration of the drug, in
milligrams per milliliter (“mg/ml”), can overdose the patient.  AR 10049. 
When these patients end up in other institutions, like emergency rooms, the
staff may determine the drug needs to be refilled to avoid withdrawal and
consult the drug’s concentration.  AR
10049.  If the concentration is listed as
ten mg/ml when it is actually only 1 mg/ml, the institution will overdose the
patient when they refill the drug with a concentration of 10 mg/ml.  AR 10049.
 
            (2).
Excessive Dosage            
Nothing in Patient A’s progress notes explains why Smith
increased the rate of fentanyl pumped. 
AR 10083.             Smith increased Patient A’s fentanyl dosage even when her
pain score was low and she was improving in her activities of daily living (“ADL”).  AR 10886-87. 
If Smith sought to reduce the pain score to zero, that was unrealistic
and is never the goal in pain management. 
AR 10887-88.  The goal is to
balance pain level with an improvement in patient function.  AR 10888. 
Trying to lower the pain level to zero increases the risk to the patient
through the excessive use of medication. 
AR 10888.  The physician should
try to keep the dose of the drug to a minimum. 
AR 10888.
At one point, Smith lowered Patient A’s daily fentanyl dose
from 13.7 mg per day to 6.87 mg per day. AR 10103.  He recognized his mistake in the entry of the
fentanyl concentration.  AR 10103.  By the end of 2017, however, he had increased
the rates again.  AR 10103.  Wallace could not explain why there was such
a huge increase.  AR 10103.  
These fentanyl dosages were excessive and beyond what
Wallace had ever seen in an intrathecal pump before.  AR 10096. 
Fentanyl is 100 times more powerful than morphine and 7.5 mg is enough
to put somebody down for cardiac anesthesia. 
AR 10096. The Polyanalgesic Consensus Conference’s (“PACC”) guidelines
have never recognized a fentanyl concentration of more than 5 mg/ml as within
the standard of care.  AR 10302-03.  Patients should also start at the lowest
concentration possible and work their way up. 
AR 10303.  In contrast, the
patients in this case started with concentrations of 25 or 17 mg/ml.  AR 10303.
The excessively high dosages for both Patients A and B
reflected an extreme departure from the standard of care.  AR 10103-04, 10149.  As of the end of 2017, Smith’s programming of
Patient A’s pump was also an extreme departure from the standard of care
because the listed drug concentrations did not reflect what actually was in the
pump.  AR 10104.  The 2015-2016 records for Patient B show that
Smith incorrectly programmed drug concentrations for her pump, and this was
also an extreme departure from the standard of care.   AR 10149.
 
            (3).
Ketamine
            Smith
used ketamine in one of the intrathecal pumps. 
AR 10077.  This was below the
standard of care because animal studies have confirmed that ketamine is toxic.  AR 10077-78. 
It results in vacuolization, or punched-out lesions, in the spinal cord.  AR 10078. 
The case reports rarely reflect that ketamine is even used, so there are
no long-term studies on it.  AR 10079.
            Wallace
has reviewed the articles that Smith’s expert witness, Jack M. Berger, M.D.
(“Berger”), cited in disagreeing with Wallace on the effects of ketamine on the
spine.  AR 10911-12.  Berger concluded that the prescription of
ketamine was part of the treatment, and that the amount did not pose a hazard
of neurosis or as a neurotoxin.  AR
10912.  None of the articles cited by
Berger support this conclusion, and one actually supported Wallace’s
opinion.  AR 10913.
 
            (3).
Psychological Evaluation
Physicians that provide intrathecal therapy generally agree
that psychological evaluation is necessary before either a pump trial or
permanent implantation.  AR
10076-77.  Smith should have patients
undergo psychological evaluation before a pump trial.  AR 10075. 
Intrathecal therapy is a highly invasive and expensive therapy, and it
requires a lot of healthcare reliance by the patient.  AR 10066. 
The physician “marries” the patient. 
AR 10066.  If a physician wants to
begin such an invasive and expensive therapy, he should first ensure the
patient has psychosocial stability based on controlled depression and anxiety.  AR 10066, 10075-76.  
The purpose of psychological evaluation is to provide the
implanter with the details of the patient’s psychological status.  AR 10870. 
Detail is required because the psychiatrist is not the practitioner who
will manage the patient’s intrathecal therapy. 
AR 10871.  The physician who will
manage it needs to know all the psychological issues the patient has.  AR 10871. 
The physician should also ask whether the patient has any other
psychiatric illnesses and make sure the patient has realistic expectations and
the social support system to get to the visits. 
AR 10066.  Smith’s failure to do
so constituted an extreme departure from the standard of care.  AR 10077.
It also is a departure from the standard of care to use a
patient’s unwillingness to manage oral medications as a reason to move forward
with intrathecal therapy.  AR 10194.
Between hearing days, Wallace learned about a scribbled note
with psychological clearance for Patient B. 
AR 10869.  This note was
inadequate to satisfy the standard of care. 
AR 10870.  Patient B needed a psychological
evaluation, not a clearance.  AR
10869-70.  An evaluation is not just a
“yes” or “no” as to whether the patient can obtain an intrathecal pump.  AR 10870. 

            Nothing
in Patient C’s medical record suggests that Smith even considered a patient psychological
evaluation.  AR 10179.  Although Patient C never had a pump
installed, it was still a departure from the standard of care to consider intrathecal
therapy without slowing down for a psychological evaluation.  AR 10179.
            Patient
C also wrote in a letter that she has a lot of stress which Wallace opined was
psychologically driven.  AR 10180.  Patient C needed a biopsychosocial approach to
her pain instead of focusing on intrathecal therapy, which is invasive and
expensive.  AR 10180.  Pushing her into intrathecal therapy was an
extreme departure from the standard of care. 
AR 10180.  
 
            b.
Berger
            The
PACC guidelines are not standards of care. 
AR 11207.  Physicians can use
their own experience and judgment to go outside those guidelines if appropriate
because they are familiar with what they are doing.  AR 11207. 
No one can really judge their decision as long as they document the
appropriateness of the decision in their thought process.  AR 11207. 

            A
patient uses an intrathecal pump to alleviate the necessity to take pain
medications.  AR 11228.  That medication could contribute to the
patient’s emotional discord or impair the patient’s cognitive ability.  AR 11228. 
Because of this, there is no standard of care requirement for a
psychiatric or psychological evaluation before a pump trial.  AR 11228, 11245.  
            The
standard of care does not require a psychological evaluation before permanent
implantation of a pump unless the physician suspects the patient is incapable
of understanding the procedure or consenting to it.  AR 11245, 11385.  If Smith had suspected that based on his
initial screening of the patient, the standard of care would have required him
to reach out to a psychiatrist for evaluation. 
AR 11386-87.
            The
ketamine in Patient A’s pump was present for over a year without any adverse
effect.  AR 11336.  The absence of harm to some extent supports
the conclusion that it was safe to use for that specific patient if it was
adding a benefit.  AR 11336.  Patient A had complex regional pain syndrome,
and ketamine is useful when treating it. 
AR 11342.  It was appropriate to
use ketamine at least on a trial basis to see if it would provide additional
benefit.  AR 11342.  Berger would only reduce the ketamine if he
saw some level of harm associated with its use rather than the other drugs in
the pump.  AR 11337.  The use of ketamine ultimately was a non-issue
because it did not cause injury to Patient A. 
AR 11341.
            Fentanyl
is very soluble, and you can have very high concentrations in the pump such as
25 mg/ml without a problem of precipitation. 
AR 11369.  Patients A and B did
not suffer harm from the dose levels of fentanyl administered through the
intrathecal pump, aside from one incident with Patient A.  AR 11369. 
This suggests that Smith’s treatment of both patients was within the
standard of care.  AR 11369.
            Berger
had Smith’s help in preparing his expert reports for this case.  AR 11409. 
Berger generally tries to find notes to dispute accusations made by the
Board’s expert.  AR 11409.  When there are a lot of records, he needs
help finding those notes.  AR 11409-410.  There was a lot of discussion and a lot to
prepare in this case.  AR 11410.  Smith found the notes that helped Berger
prepare his report.  AR 11410.  Although Berger typed the report himself, he
may have cited language from Smith’s notes. 
AR 11410.  Nevertheless, Berger
would not have submitted the report if he did not agree with everything it
said.  AR 11410.
 
            c.
Smith
            Medtronic,
the company from whom Smith buys intrathecal pumps, said that he is probably
the largest private implanter in San Diego. 
AR 10793-94.  
            Intrathecally
delivered drugs have a greater effect at smaller doses than intravenously
delivered drugs.  AR 10779.  When asked if toxic drugs have a different
effect on the spine when introduced intrathecally instead of intravenously,
Smith replied that was beyond his level of knowledge.  AR 10779. 

            Smith
rejected Wallace’s assertion that his dosing levels of intrathecal fentanyl
were excessive and below the standard of care. 
AR 10990-91.  If the Board permits
him to work on intrathecal pumps in the future, he will not decrease the
dosage.  AR 10991.  He also rejected Wallace’s opinion as to the
use of intrathecal ketamine in pumps.  AR
10991.  If the Board permits him to work with
intrathecal pumps, he will continue to use ketamine in those pumps.  AR 10991.
            Smith
contested Wallace’s assertion that his failure to obtain a psychological
evaluation for Patients A-C fell below the standard of care.  AR 10991-92. 
Smith did get psychological clearance for Patients A and B.  AR 10992. 
Psychological evaluations are not required, but he has gotten them for
every patient in the last 4-5 years if the trial pump was successful.  AR 10992.
            He
has been restricted from using intrathecal pumps for a little bit more than a
year.  AR 11041.  The Board has communicated directly with
Smith to tell him he can probably return to treating patients with intrathecal
pumps within the next couple of weeks. 
AR 11041.
 
d. Smith’s Closing Argument
            Smith’s
counsel argued against discipline prohibiting him from advising on the use of
intrathecal pumps.  AR 11495.  For example, if Smith wanted to teach, such
discipline could keep him from teaching about the use of intrathecal pain
pumps.  AR 11495.  This raises serious First Amendment issues
relative to the desired probation term. 
AR 11495.
 
            3. The ALJ’s Proposed Decision
            On November 9, 2021, ALJ
Levy issued a proposed decision for the 2020 Accusation.  AR 9773-860. 
The proposed decision concluded Smith had departed from standards of
care through his (1) use of ketamine and excessive use of fentanyl in intrathecal
therapy, (2) failure to obtain psychological evaluations for Patients A-B
before proceeding with pump implantation or for Patient C before scheduling her
for a trial pump, and (3) failure to correctly program the pumps for two of the
patients.  AR 9774.  He also failed to maintain adequate records
and engaged in unprofessional conduct. 
AR 9774.  To protect the public,
the proposed decision prohibited Smith from performing intrathecal therapy or advising
other medical providers regarding intrathecal therapy.  AR 9774. 
This prohibition would run concurrently with the probation imposed under
the 2020 Decision.  AR 9774.  
            The proposed decision referred
to the 2020 Decision and identified the performance of intrathecal therapy
procedures as an issue in both the 2020 Decision and the instant matter.  AR 9775-76.
 
            a. Patient A
            Patient A had suffered from depression since
she was an adolescent.  AR 9779.  Patient A’s signed intake documents from
December 2016 included a patient authorization form permitting Smith to obtain
psychotherapy notes from Patient A’s clinical psychologist.  AR 9779. 
Smith never obtained those notes. 
AR 9779. 
            A May 2, 2017 operative
procedure report documented that Patient A had undergone psychological testing
and was cleared to proceed with the pump trial. 
AR 9780.  This report did not
identify who conducted the testing or when. 
AR 9781.  Smith testified that he
talked to Patient A’s psychiatrist after the pump trial, not before.  AR 9781. 
The ALJ concluded that the operative procedure report was
inaccurate.  AR 9781.  
            Smith surgically
implanted the intrathecal tube on June 13, 2017.  AR 9782. 
Between that date and August 2017, the pump’s programmed drug
concentration was higher than the actual concentration.  AR 9782. 
Wallace testified that if a third-party doctor had interrogated the pump
during this time, he could have prescribed a drug that would have caused
Patient A to overdose.  AR 9783.  On August 30, 2017, Smith corrected the
initial concentration and current pump rate programmed into the pump, but he
did not note the corrections in Patient A’s records.  AR 9783, 9787.
            Although Patient A’s
pain levels often decreased from June to August 2017, Smith often increased the
fentanyl dosage without explanation.  AR
9783-86.  By the end of 2017, Smith had
increased the fentanyl dosage 14 times despite improvement in her reported pain
levels.  AR 9790.  The rate of intrathecal ketamine remained
constant throughout.  AR 9790.
            On March 2, 2018,
Patient A experienced excruciating pain when she put her full weight on her
right leg.  AR 9791.  At the University of California San Diego
Medical Center (“UCSD”), several doctors noted she was on a on a very
high-dosage intrathecal therapy opioid regimen and was opioid tolerant.  AR 9791-92. 
They fine-tuned pain management during her hospital stay with the
administration of opioids and ketamine. 
AR 9792.
            Less than an hour after
her March 30, 2018 refill at Smith’s office, Patient A suffered from acute drug
overdose.  AR 9792.  Her husband called 911, and EMTs administered
Narcan to revive her.  AR 9793.  She was admitted to UCSD for observation,
where one physician determined that a small amount of fentanyl had been
subcutaneously deposited during the refill. 
AR 9793.  Because her intrathecal
therapy dosages were incredibly high, a risk of overdose and death was present
with every refill.  AR 9793.  The hospital pain management physician told Patient
A that she had enough fentanyl in her pump to kill everyone in the emergency
room.  AR 9793-94.
 
            (1). Wallace 
            Wallace identified four
ways in which Smith departed from applicable standards of care in his treatment
of Patient A.  AR 9799.  Smith incorrectly programmed Patient A’s
initial drug concentrations, failed to have her undergo psychological
evaluation to see if she was an appropriate candidate for intrathecal therapy,
administered excessively high dosages of fentanyl, and administered ketamine in
the pump.  AR 9799.
            As to the programming
error, inaccurate concentrations can lead to an overdose or underdose if
another institution must refill the pump. 
AR 9799.  Because the error would
have led to overdose and harm in Patient A’s case, this was an extreme
departure from the standard of care.  AR
9799.  
            The standard of care
requires psychological evaluation of any patients identified for intrathecal
therapy.  AR 9799.  This evaluation identifies any psychosocial
barriers that might prevent a successful outcome.  AR 9799-800. 
The PACC guidelines recommend this, and other intrathecal therapy
specialists widely accept it as necessary. 
AR 9800.  Intrathecal therapy is a
highly invasive and expensive therapy, and it requires a lot of healthcare
reliance by the patient.  AR 9800.  The physician “marries” the patient.  AR 9800.  He therefore should first ensure the patient
will be reliable, be psychosocially stable, and have realistic expectations as
to the outcome.  AR 9800.  
            Nothing in Patient A’s records
suggested she underwent psychological testing. 
AR 9800.  Wallace dismissed
Smith’s statement in the May 2, 2017 operative procedure report that she had
psychological testing.  AR 9800.  Patient A’s depression by itself was not a
contraindication for intrathecal therapy. 
AR 9800.  However, Patient A’s
reported depression, her management thereof through medication, and her
mother’s mental health history made it important that Patient A undergo psychological
evaluation before even the pump trial.  AR
9800-01.  The failure to conduct this
evaluation was an extreme departure from the standard of care.  AR 9800. 

            For intrathecal dosages,
the standard of care requires use of small dosages in intrathecal therapy
because the drug is targeted for delivery in the spinal cord.  AR 9801. 
Fentanyl is also 100 times more potent than morphine, and a small amount
outside the pump can pose a risk to the patient.  AR 9801. 
The dosages of fentanyl used for Patient A reflect an extreme departure
from the standard of care.  AR 9801.  Wallace has never seen anyone administer the
dosages at issue here via intrathecal pump, and treatment should not start with
fentanyl as the driver drug.  AR
9801.  This excessive dosage caused harm
on March 30, 2018, when a small amount administered outside the pump pocket
caused Patient A to overdose.  AR
9801-03.  
            Although there is no
known upper limit to intrathecal use, there is still a limit based on clinical
judgment.  AR 9802.  Smith’s decision to start Patient A on a high
amount of fentanyl and titrate her further up without explanation raises doubts
as to his clinical judgment.  AR
9802-03.  Patient A never had the chance
to see if a lower dosage would have improved her pain level and allowed her to
better function.  AR 9802-9803.  
            For the use of ketamine,
the standard of care requires that the physician uses safe drugs for intrathecal
therapy.   AR 9803.  The safety of ketamine is not a “gray area” because
it is toxic to the spinal cord.  AR
9803-04.  One study expressed concern for
the long-term effects of its use in intrathecal therapy.  AR
9804.  It cited a postmortem of a cancer
patient who underwent ketamine intrathecal therapy and had holes in his spinal
cord.  AR 9804.  Its toxicity to dogs and sheep prompted the
Food and Drug Administration to suspend clinical trials in humans.  AR 9804. 
Wallace was aware of only two case reports where ketamine was used in
intrathecal therapy, and both were cancer patients where more aggressive pain
management treatments may be warranted. 
AR 9805.  A study cited in Berger’s
report supports the conclusion that there are long-term safety concerns with
ketamine use in intrathecal therapy.  AR
9805.  None of the other articles Berger
cites mention ketamine.  AR 9806.
            The Centers for Medicare
& Medicaid Services (“CMS”) has authorized ketamine’s use in intrathecal
therapy via local coverage determination (“LCD”).  AR 9805. 
However, the LCD does not establish the standard of care.  AR 9805. 
The use of ketamine in intrathecal therapy represents an extreme
departure from the standard of care.  AR
9804.
 
            (2). Berger
            Berger has performed
medical-legal evaluations and has served as a consultant for the Board.  AR 9806. 
He has coauthored many published papers and abstracts on pain management
through 2021.  AR 9807.  He has served as a consultant for the
Board.  AR 9806.  He was one of the earliest implanters of
intrathecal pumps in the 1980s and has implanted 40-50 pumps, three or four of
them with ketamine.  AR 9807.
            Berger asserted that
Smith’s programming error was a simple departure from the standard of care, not
an extreme one.  AR 9808.  His report states the dosage discrepancies
were small and would not have caused harm to Patient A.  AR 9812. 

Berger asserted that
Smith did not deviate from the standard of care as to the other three
issues.  AR 9808.  There is disagreement in the pain management
community as to whether a psychological evaluation is necessary before intrathecal
therapy.  AR 9808.  Smith did not need one for Patient A before
the trial pump.  AR 9808.  Berger conceded the standard of care may
require a psychological evaluation based on a patient’s presentation.  AR 9808. 
If so, the physician still decides what to do with this information.  AR 9808. 
He does not need it to “clear” the patient for intrathecal therapy.  AR 9808.
            Berger’s report noted that
Patient A was under the care of a psychiatrist and a therapist.  AR 9808. 
This suggests that Berger believed that any need for a psychological
evaluation was obviated.  AR 9808.  No documentation supports that Patient A had
such care and Berger admitted that his understanding that Patient A was under
the care of a psychiatrist and a psychologist from his conversation with
Smith.  AR 9808-09.
            For fentanyl dosages,
PACC’s 2017 guidelines state that the patient’s physician and good clinical judgment
should guide individual patient care.  AR
9809.  As long as the physician documents
his reasoning for the dosage, his judgment cannot be questioned.  AR 9809. 
Physicians can go beyond consensus guidelines because it is appropriate,
and they are familiar with what they are doing. 
AR 9809.
            Physicians use clinical
judgment when they find the appropriate dosage level based on the patient’s
response to the current dose.  AR
9810.  They start with one or two drugs
and slowly increase the dosage or number of drugs as they monitor the
patient.  AR 9810.  If the patient does not respond to one drug,
the physician may replace the drug or add a second one.  AR 9810.
            Smith correctly treated Patient
A through a pump trial of fentanyl.  AR
9810.  Based on her response, he then
decided to implant the intrathecal pump with a similar concentration.  AR 9810. 
Smith slowly increased the dosage to find the best possible relief
without side effects.  AR 9811.  He knew the concentrations were high, but he
monitored Patient A carefully.  AR
9811.  He saw her regularly and adjusted
her dosage based on her description of her condition and her consent to the
increase.  AR 9811.  The dosage gave significant pain relief and
allowed Patient A to return to ADLs.  AR
9811.
            Finding the appropriate
fentanyl dosage is not an exact science and there is no maximum dose of
fentanyl for intrathecal therapy.  AR
9810.  The maximum dosage in intrathecal
therapy is the dose that provides relief without side effects.  AR 9810. 
Intrathecal therapy delivers the medication into the intrathecal sac so that
it contacts the spinal cord.  AR
9810.  This reduces the impact on the
body’s system compared to delivery of the drug systematically.  AR 9810. 

For ketamine, Berger
opined that its use in intrathecal therapy should not be strictly
prohibited.  AR 9811.  Studies disagree on whether it is neurotoxic
in low dosages, and Berger does not believe it is.  AR 9812. 
Ketamine enhanced fentanyl’s effect for Patient A without requiring a
higher dosage of fentanyl.  AR
9811-12.  This combined therapy provided
the best relief with minimal side effects. 
AR 9812.
            Berger recognized that
there is debate regarding ketamine’s neurotoxicity at low doses.  AR 9812. 
His report was not as certain as his testimony about whether the use of
ketamine is within the standard of care. 
AR 9812.  He wrote that Smith’s use
of ketamine at low dosages “does not appear” to have departed from the standard
of care.  AR 9812.  This contrasts sharply with the certainty he
expressed in his testimony.  AR 9812.
 
            b. Patient B
            When Smith first saw
Patient B, she had been under the care of a psychiatrist for many years.  AR 9813. 
Her medical history included schizophrenia, a history of opioid abuse,
anxiety, depression, spinal
injury, and traumatic brain injury secondary to domestic abuse.  AR 9813. 
Smith knew Patient B likely engaged in opioid abuse and overdosed based
on her response to Narcan.  AR 9814.  Despite this, he did not discuss with Patient
B whether she should undergo psychological evaluation before considering her
for a pump trial.  AR 9814.
            Smith implanted an
intrathecal pump in Patient B on December 17, 2015.  AR 9817. 
Smith submitted a barely legible handwritten note as evidence.  AR 9817. 
He asserted that this note was written by Laurence Saben, M.D. (“Saben”)
and that it cleared Patient B for the procedure.  AR 9817. 
This note was not in Saben’s records for Patient B.  AR 9817. 
Nor is it among the records for Patient B initially submitted by Smith
as Patient B’s complete records.  AR
9818.
            Smith increased Patient
B’s fentanyl dosage across multiple visits in 2016.  AR 9819-20. 
During a March 2017 refill, Smith added ketamine to the medication
formula without explanation.  AR
9823.  Smith concedes that he programmed
the pump incorrectly on that date.  AR
9823.
            On August 10, 2017,
Smith signed a letter discharging Patient B from this care, effective the same
day.  AR 9824.
 
            (1). Wallace
            Wallace identified the
same departures from the standard of care as with Patient A.  AR 9824. 
The programming error was an extreme departure from the standard of
care.  AR 9824.  It likely would have led to drug overdose if
someone had used the drug concentrations programmed into the pump.  AR 9824.
            The standard of care
required Patient B to undergo psychological evaluation before Smith selected
her for intrathecal therapy.  AR
9824-25.  Her mental health history and
her history of drug use made this especially important.  AR 9825. 
She had previously overdosed and had a history of opioid abuse.  AR 9825. 
She had traumatic brain injury with cognitive impairment, severe mental
health disturbances, schizophrenia, and major depression.  AR 9825. 
She complained during her pump trial of swelling, paralysis, and
worsening of her schizoaffective symptoms. 
AR 9825.
            Intrathecal therapy only
succeeds if the patient has such mental health conditions under control.  AR 9825. 
Based on Patient B’s history, Smith needed hand-to-hand participation of
a therapist to even consider intrathecal therapy.  AR 9826. 
He also should have determined whether Patient B was even
psychologically able to have a pump.  AR
9826.
            Nothing in the record
suggested that Saben evaluated Patient B before the trial or pump
implantation.  AR 9826.  Assuming Saben wrote the note, a psychological
evaluation is required, not just a clearance to proceed with the intrathecal
therapy.  AR 9825-26.  The evaluation should provide information
about the physical and mental aspects of the patient’s pain.  AR 9825. The note does not provide the
information Smith needed to assess Patient B’s psychosocial state and decide
whether to proceed with her intrathecal therapy.  AR 9825-26. 
The failure to subject Patient B to psychological evaluation was an
extreme departure from the
standard of care.  AR 9825.  
            For the fentanyl dosage,
Wallace reiterated the doses exceeded those for cardiac anesthesia and were
extreme for intrathecal therapy.  AR
9827.  The starting daily rate of 1.997
mg was very high and unjustified, and the rate increase to 7 mg per day was
also high.  AR 9827.  As for ketamine, Wallace again asserted that its
use in intrathecal therapy is an extreme departure from the standard of
care.  AR 9827.
 
            (2). Berger
            Berger again asserted that
Smith’s programming error was only a standard departure from the standard of
care.  AR 9829.  The difference in concentration was not so
extreme as to make a huge difference in the pump output.  AR 9829. 
As with Patient A, Berger asserted the other three issues do not reflect
a departure from the standard of care. 
AR 9827-28.  
            Because Patient B’s
medical records twice note she had both a psychiatrist and a therapist, Smith
did not need a psychological evaluation before the pump trial.  AR 9828. 
Active mental illness is not a contraindication for intrathecal therapy.  AR 9828. 
The pain management doctor himself judges whether a patient is an
appropriate candidate based on their interactions and the patient’s answers to
questions the doctor chooses.  AR
9828.  
            Berger recognized the
importance of psychological evaluation for some patients before intrathecal
therapy.  AR 9828.  Paradoxically, he also minimized the
importance of psychological evaluation for any patient.  AR 9828.
            Smith exercised sound clinical
judgment in fentanyl dosing.  AR
9828.  He closely monitored and followed
Patient B.  AR 9828.  Her pain levels improved, she was able to do
her ADLs, and she even transitioned to an independent living facility.  AR 9828.
            For the use of ketamine
in intrathecal therapy, Berger reiterated the same arguments that it does not
breach the standard of care as for Patient A. 
AR 9829.
 
            c. Patient C
            On March 20, 2018,
Patient C asked to discuss a treatment plan for her back and knee pain.  AR 9830. 
The medication regimen she used to address her back and knee pain was
completely ineffective.  AR 9830.  Smith changed her prescription to an
opioid.  AR 9830.  As Smith left the exam room, Patient C said that
the new medication would not be effective. 
AR 9830.  She said her only
options were to overtake medications or commit suicide.  AR 9830. 
Whether Smith ever learned about these comments was unclear.  AR 9831.
            Smith recommended an
intrathecal pump trial for April 24, 2018. 
AR 9831.  Smith did not document
discussing with Patient C her threat of suicide, or the need to obtain a psychological
evaluation before the trial.  AR 9831.
            On April 6, Patient C
returned and asked for a refill of her medication.  AR 9831. 
She said that she overused the medication because it was
ineffective.  AR 9831.  This was 13 days before her medication should
have run out, and the second time she had run out early.  AR 9831. 
Smith informed Patient C that her option was to undergo the intrathecal
pump trial on April 9, 2018.  AR
9831.  Patient C agreed.  AR
9831.  
            On April 18, Patient C
told Smith she did not want to go through with the pump trial because the
possible complications outweighed the benefits. 
AR 9831.  Smith refused to
prescribe more oral medication because she was non-compliant with the treatment
plan.  AR 9832.   
            Wallace testified that
Smith’s failure to obtain a psychological evaluation was an extreme departure
from the standard of care.  AR 9832.  Patient C exhibited several red flags.  AR 9832. 
She was on high doses of opioids with little pain control, and she was non-compliant
with the prescribed opioid use.  AR
9832.  Smith was pushing her into intrathecal
therapy.  AR 9832.
            Berger reiterated that
the standard of care does not require a psychological evaluation.  AR 9833. 
Smith also did not pressure Patient C into having the pump.  AR 9833. 
She had time to consider whether it was appropriate for her.  AR 9833.
 
            d. Smith
            Smith testified that Patients
A-C all tried many pain therapy modalities before intrathecal therapy.  AR 9834. 
He does not rush his patients to intrathecal therapy and the trial pump
is simple and minimally invasive.  AR
9834.  It allows him to adjust the
dosages whereas a permanent pump is better for fine tuning drugs.  AR 9834.
            Smith agreed that
implanting a pump is akin to marrying the patient and raises the patient’s
dependency on the physician.  AR
9834.  The process is a collaboration.  AR 9834. 
He talks to his patients to see if he should increase the rate.  AR 9834. 
He does if the patient is improving without any red flags.  AR 9834.
            Patient A’s overdose
happened because a drop of fentanyl entered her system subcutaneously during
the refill, which is rare.  AR 9835.  The extra drop caused a change or decrease in
Patient A’s consciousness, but she did not lose consciousness.  AR 9835. 
(Hospital records confirm that Patient A did lose consciousness.  AR 9835.) 
Patient A wanted to continue intrathecal therapy even after this
incident.  AR 9835.  She remains Smith’s patient to this day.  AR 9835.
            Smith disagreed with Wallace’s
assertion that trial pump therapy caused Patient A’s opioid dependence and
withdrawal.  AR 9836.  Her dependency was caused by her fentanyl
patches and oral medication.  AR 9836.
            Smith felt that Patient
B was an excellent candidate for a pump because it allowed for the delivery of
pain medication without taking oral medications with possible abuse.  AR 9839. 
He recognized that Patient B presented a challenge, and he obtained a
psychological clearance from Saban.  AR
936-37.
For the use of
ketamine, his own research did not reveal its spinal cord toxicity in 2015 and
2016.  AR 9838.
            Smith has complied with
the terms of his probation.  AR
9839.  He completed the Clinical
Competence Assessment Program
required by the probation terms of the 2020 Decision.  AR 9840. 
He can now perform surgical procedures related to intrathecal pumps.  AR 9840. 

 
            e. The Parties’ Closing Arguments
            Complainant’s counsel
argued that Wallace is a leading expert in intrathecal therapy and has
published extensively in the field, while Berger’s intrathecal therapy
experience is limited.  AR 9841.  Berger has never published on the
subject.  AR 9841.  Berger’s testimony also raised doubt as to
his credibility because actual harm is not required to demonstrate an extreme
departure from the standard of care.  AR
9841.  Complainant requested the Board to
prohibit Smith from practicing intrathecal therapy during the remainder of his
probation imposed by the 2020 Decision. 
9841.  
            Smith’s counsel
responded that there is no consensus as to fentanyl dosages and the evidence is
not clear as to the standard of care.  AR
9841.  He monitored Patients A and B and
adjusted their doses based on their responses to current doses.  AR 9841. 
He talked to Patient A’s psychiatrist and simply failed to document
it.  AR 9842.  There is no evidence that Patient B is schizophrenic.  AR 9842. 
CMS permits the use of ketamine in intrathecal therapy.  AR 9842. 
The programming error was a simple departure from the standard of care,
not an extreme one.  AR 9842.  Smith also argued that no purpose would be
served by imposing discipline as he is already on probation and revocation of
his license would not serve any purpose either. 
AR 9842.  
            Complainant replied that,
while there is no known upper limit for fentanyl dosing in intrathecal therapy,
Wallace did not rely only on the consensus guidelines for his opinion on the
fentanyl dosages.  AR 9842-43.  Smith also did not want to accept
responsibility for the programming errors, which were an extreme departure from
the standard of care because they could have led to incorrect dosing of the
patients.  AR 9843.  This action was not a do-over of the
discipline under the 2020 Decision; the only shared issue between the cases was
the programming error.  AR 9843. 
 
            f. Evaluation of Evidence
            (1). First and Second Causes
            The 2020 Accusation’s
first and second causes allege gross and simple negligence for Patients A-B and
gross negligence for Patient C.  AR
9844-45.  To the extent that Smith
committed acts of gross negligence for Patients A-B, he also committed repeated
negligent acts.  AR 3692, 9844.  
            The 2020 Accusation
alleges gross negligence based on Smith’s failure to obtain psychological
evaluations before implantation of intrathecal pumps in Patients A-B and before
scheduling Patient C for a pump trial. 
AR 9844.  Wallace’s assertion that
this was an extreme departure from the standard of care is persuasive.  AR 9844. 
He testified the standard of care requires such evaluation before
implantation of a pump or use of a trial pump. 
AR 9844.  This allows the doctor
to ensure the patient has both the psychosocial stability to follow up with
care and realistic expectations of the goals of pain management.  AR 9844.
            All three patients had
mental health issues that required an evaluation before any intrathecal therapy.    AR 9844. 
Patient A suffered from, and was undergoing treatment for,
depression.  AR 9844.  Patient B had a history of serious mental
illness and had overdosed on methadone. 
AR 9844.  Patient C had
history of anxiety and sleep problems, had overused
opioid pain medications, was opioid dependent, and threatened to kill herself
if Smith did not refill her medication.  AR 9844-45. 
Smith did not obtain psychological evaluations for any of these
patients.  AR 9845.  
No evidence
substantiates the assertion that Saben wrote the scribbled note about Patient
B.  AR 9845.  Even if he did, the note was worthless
because it does not contain information to identify Patient B’s psychosocial
state.  AR 9845.  Smith asserted that Patient C did not need psychological
evaluation before intrathecal therapy because she did not proceed with the
trial.  AR 9846.  This ignores the standard of care, which
Wallace stated requires a psychological evaluation before proceeding with intrathecal
therapy.  AR 9846.  
            Wallace’s testimony was
more persuasive than Berger’s testimony that the dosages of fentanyl for Patients
A and B were excessive.  AR 9846.  Wallace had more extensive experience as an intrathecal
therapy practitioner, and he was familiar with the current state of relevant
research.  AR 9846.  Nothing in Berger’s CV suggested that he
performs or has published on intrathecal therapy and his experience in the
practice is limited.  AR 9847.  
            Wallace testified that
the standard of care requires small dosages because the drugs are delivered
directly into the spinal cord.  AR
9847.  A small amount outside the pump
can be dangerous, and Patient A’s overdose proves that.  AR 9847. 
Wallace has never seen the levels of fentanyl administered to Patients A
and B used in any other intrathecal pump. 
AR 9847.  The doses were akin to
those in cardiac anesthesia.  AR
9847.  
            Wallace also testified that
Smith’s clinical judgment was lacking. 
AR 9847.  Smith never explained
why he started Patients A-B on those dosages and increased them even when the
patients showed good improvement.  AR
9847.  Berger testified that no one can
question a pain management doctor’s decision if he documents the
appropriateness of the dosage level in his thought process, but Smith never did
so.  AR 9847-48.
            As for ketamine,
Wallace’s testimony that its use was an extreme departure from the standard of
care was persuasive.  AR 9848.  He based this opinion on his extensive and up
to date knowledge of studies and case reports in this area.  AR 9848. 
Even a study Berger cited supports this conclusion.  AR 9848. 

            Wallace’s testimony was
again more persuasive on whether the failure to correctly program the pumps
constitutes a normal or extreme departure from the standard of care.  AR 9848. 
This failure could have caused another physician to either overdose or
underdose the patient based on the inaccurate concentration levels.  AR 9848. 
Contrary to Berger’s testimony, actual patient harm is not a
prerequisite to finding a departure is extreme. 
AR 9849.  
 
            (2). Third, Fourth, and Fifth Causes
            The third cause for
discipline alleged committed repeated acts of clearly excessive prescribing
drugs or treatment to Patients A-B.  AR
9849.  Wallace’s testimony that Smith
excessively prescribed fentanyl was more persuasive than Berger’s testimony
that he did not.  AR 9849.  Smith’s failure to document the reason for
the dosages supports this conclusion.  AR
9849.  
            The fourth cause for
discipline alleged a failure to maintain adequate and accurate records for
Patients A-B.  AR 9849.  Smith failed to document the reasons for the
selected dosages of fentanyl and ketamine. 
AR 9849.  He did not document why
he reduced Patient B’s fentanyl dose rate by half.  AR 9849-50. 
His documented programming of both pumps was also inaccurate.  AR 9850.
            The fifth cause for
discipline alleged unprofessional
conduct.  AR 9850.  The findings for the other causes support a
conclusion that Smith committed unprofessional conduct.  AR 9850.
 
            g. Discipline
            License revocation is
not necessary to ensure public protection. 
AR 9858.  A probationary period to
run concurrently with Smith’s existing probation, with the added prohibition on
intrathecal therapy practice, would ensure public protection.  AR 9858. 

            Smith’s misconduct was
serious and exposed Patients A-B to actual harm, particularly when Patient A
overdosed during her refill.  AR 9858.  He excessively administered fentanyl to both
patients and increased the dosage even when they reported improvements in pain
levels and function.  AR 9858.  He also administered ketamine, which may be
neurotoxic, and did so without documenting the reason.  AR 9858. 
He never obtained psychological evaluations for his three patients
despite evidence that all three suffered from problems that raised concerns as
to psychological stability.  AR
9858.  His programming errors regarding
drug concentration in the pumps alone also would warrant serious
discipline.  AR 9859.  
            Several mitigation
factors existed.  AR 9859.  Smith complied fully with the terms of his
probation, including monitoring and his completion of a Clinical
Competence Assessment Program.  AR 9859. 
He credibly asserted that he is committed to improved recordkeeping and
has made changes to his practice to prevent future programming errors.  AR 9859. 
Smith also was attentive and closely followed Patients A-C during their
treatment.  AR 9859.
            The ALJ’s proposed decision
revoked Smith’s license, stayed the revocation, and placed him on probation for
the same duration as under the 2020 Decision. 
AR 9859.  In addition to the existing
probation terms, Smith was prohibited from performing any patient treatment involving
the use, management, or surgical procedure related to intrathecal pumps.  AR 9859-60. 
He also was prohibited from advising any medical provider on the care or
treatment of patients involving the use, management or any surgical procedure
related to intrathecal pumps.  AR
9860.  
 
            4. The 2021 Decision
            The Board adopted the
ALJ’s proposed decision as the 2021 Decision on December 22, 2021, with an
effective date of January 21, 2022.  AR
9772.
On January 12, 2022,
Smith file a petition for reconsideration of the 2021 Decision.  AR 3709. 
The Board denied the petition for reconsideration by operation of
law.  AR 9866.
 
E. Analysis
Petitioner Smith argues that (1) the Board’s 2021 Decision
amends the 2020 Decision that was set aside and is void, (2) the Board abused
its discretion where it imposed an unconstitutional gag order and imposed an
illogical practice restriction, and (3) these restrictions were not supported
by the weight of the evidence.
 
1. The
Board’s 2021 Decision is a Stand-Alone Decision
Smith argues that the
2021 Decision based its conclusions on his fitness to practice medicine and
terms of discipline on the 2020 Decision which Judge Beckloff set aside.   The 2021 Decision expressly made its
duration and effectiveness concurrent with the 2020 Decision.  When the 2020 Decision was set aside, all
discipline under that Decision necessarily ended as a matter of law, including
the discipline grafted onto it by the 2021 Decision.  Therefore, the 2021 Decision is void as a
matter of law and must be vacated.  Smith’s
counsel warned the Board about the potential for such a result at the hearing on
the 2020 Accusation, particularly since the 2020 Decision was before this court
for review at the time.  Pet. Op. Br. at
6; Reply at 3-4.
Smith acknowledges
that there is an apparent absence of authority on the question of what happens
to a disciplinary decision that appends itself to a prior decision.  He analogizes the Board’s decisions to the
legal framework for civil judgments.  If
the Board’s 2020 Decision is treated as a judgment and the 2021 Decision is
treated as an amendment of that judgment, the Board’s error becomes legally
apparent.  Vacating a judgment leaves
“the case ‘at large’ for further proceedings as if it had never been tried, and
as if no judgment had ever been rendered.” 
9 Witkin, California Procedure, (5th ed. 2008), §869; see Weisenburg
v. Cragholm, (1971) 5 Cal. 3d 892, 896.
By analogy, when Judge
Beckloff set aside the 2020 Decision, it was as if that Decision had never been
made.  Therefore, the 2021 Decision, which
relied upon and was appended to the 2020 Decision, likewise had never been made.  Pet. Op. Br. at 6-7.  While this court in Smith II viewed (without
conclusively finding) the 2022 Decision as effectively a decision after
non-adoption of the 2020 Decision, the 2022 Decision did not mention or revive
the 2021 Decision.  Consequently, the
2021 Decision must be set aside.  Reply
at 5.
Smith’s analogy is defective.  First, the 2020 Decision was not a civil
judgment; it was an administrative decision not governed by the law of procedure
for civil actions.  There is no reason to
believe that the law concerning judgments has any bearing on the analysis of
the 2020, 2021, and 2022 Decisions.
Second, and more important, the 2021 Decision never
purported to be an amendment to the 2020 Decision.  The 2021 Decision was made after a hearing on
the 2020 Accusation and its allegations concerning Smith’s treatment of three patients,
whereas the 2020 Decision was made after a hearing on the 2019 Accusation its
allegations concerning the treatment of five different patients.[3]  The 2020 Decision specifically concerned
Smith’s overprescription of pain
medication to his chronic pain patients. 
In contrast, the Board’s 2021 Decision describes the nature of Smith’s
misconduct concerning his intrathecal therapy for the three patients at issue.
While Smith is correct that the 2021 Decision ordered that
the probation imposed would run concurrently with the probation imposed in the
2020 Decision, and that the 2020 Decision was set aside in Smith I, the
Board imposed probation and a prohibition of intrathecal therapy in the 2021
Decision because Smith’s conduct represented a danger to patients based upon the
evidence in this case.  In ordering the practice restriction, the ALJ
emphasized that Patient A had suffered actual
harm where she lost consciousness after her intrathecal therapy pump was filled
with a high dosage of fentanyl at Smith’s clinic and had to be revived by
paramedics with Narcan and taken by ambulance to UCSD’s Emergency Department.[4]  Opp. at 13.
The 2021 Decision summarized Smith’s prior discipline from the
2020 Decision as a seven-year probation effective August 25, 2020, with terms
including a prohibition from performing intrathecal pain procedures until Smith
had completed a clinical competence course.  AR 9775. 
The 2021 Decision noted that Smith testified at hearing that he
“completed the clinical competence assessment course and can now perform
surgical procedures related to intrathecal pumps.” AR 9840.  Nothing in these references made the 2021
Decision an amendment of the 2020 Decision. 
Opp. at 14.
Nor did the 2021 Decision tie Smith’s probation term to the
2020 Decision.  Rather, the 2021 Decision
tied the probation to Smith’s Administrative Case No. 800-2015-013651, which at
the time was a seven-year probation.  AR
9859.  The 2020 Decision was set aside in
Smith I, but the 2022 Decision placed Smith on probation for Case No.
800-2015-013651 for five years retroactive to September 24, 2020.  Rifat Decl., ¶4, Ex. A, p. 86-98.  The 2022 Decision and its five-year probation
was upheld in Smith II.  Thus,
Smith’s probation in Case No. 800-2015-013651 is five years and the concurrent
probation from the 2021 Decision (Case No. 800-2018-042234) is for the same
period, ending on September 24, 2025.  See
Ex. A, pp. 86-98; AR 9859.
In sum, the 2021 Decision – which concerned different
patients and different misconduct than the 2020 Decision -- merely cited the
prior discipline in the 2020 Decision and incorporated the probation in Case
No. 800-2015-013651, which started as seven years but was reduced to five
years.  This is an incorporation by
reference, not a “symbiotic appendage” that died when the 2020 Decision was set
aside.  See Reply at 3.  The 2021 Decision stands alone, and its
period of probation and disciplinary order are legally enforceable.  See Opp. at 14.
 
2. The 2021 Decision Does Not Impose an Unconstitutional
Gag Order and Was a Legitimate Exercise of the Board’s Authority
Smith notes that the 2021 Decision added a probationary
term that prohibits him from performing intrathecal therapy, including a
restriction on advising medical providers:
 
“[Smith]
is prohibited from . . . advising any medical provider on the care or treatment
of patients involving the use, management, or any surgical procedure related to
intrathecal pumps for the duration of his probation [resulting from the 2020
Decision].”  AR 9859-60.  
 
Smith argues that
this gag order is plainly unconstitutional and requires that the 2021 Decision
be set aside.  Smith’s counsel warned the
Board about making such an order: “I think there’s some serious constitutional,
particularly First Amendment issues, relative to that desired probation
term.”  AR 11495.  
Smith relies on the
Ninth Circuit case of Conant v. Walters, (“Conant”) (9th Cir.
2002) 309 F.3d 629.  Pet. Op. Br. at 7.  In Conant, California and Arizona had
passed medical marijuana initiative authorizing the use of marijuana for
seriously ill patients and protecting physicians who recommended it.  Id. at 632.  In response, the federal government adopted a
policy that a doctor’s recommendation of the use of “medical marijuana” was not
in the public interest as reflected by the federal Controlled Substances Act
and any doctor who made such a recommendation could have his or her registration
to prescribe controlled substances revoked. 
Id.  The Department of
Justice and Department of Health & Humas Services later sent a letter to
national, state, and local physician associations cautioning that physicians
who “intentionally provide their patients with oral or written statements in
order to enable them to obtain controlled substances in violation of federal
law . . .  risk revocation of their DEA
prescription authority.”  Id. at
633.   The trial court issued an injunction
against the federal government either investigating or revoking a physician’s
registration to issue controlled substances where the government’s action is based
solely the physician’s recommendation of the use of medical marijuana.  Id. at 632.
In upholding the
district court’s injunction, the Ninth Circuit stated that the government
policy struck at the core First Amendment interests of doctors and patients, whom
have an imperative need for confidence and trust.  Id. at 636.  An integral component of the practice of
medicine is the communication between a doctor and a patient, and physicians
must be able to speak frankly and openly to patients as reflected by the common
law doctor-patient privilege.  Id.  Being a member of a regulated profession does
not result in a surrender of First Amendment rights.  To the contrary, professional speech may be
entitled to “the strongest protection our Constitution has to offer.”  Id. at 637 (citations omitted).
The government
policy sought to punish doctors based on the content of their communications
with patients.  Id. at 637.   It did
not merely prohibit the discussion of marijuana; it condemned a particular
viewpoint about marijuana, and the condemnation of particular views is
especially troubling in the First Amendment context.  Id. 
“When the government targets not subject matter but particular views
taken by speakers on a subject, the violation of the First Amendment is all the
more blatant.’….Indeed, even content-based restrictions on speech are
‘presumptively invalid.’”  Id.
(citations omitted).
To survive First
Amendment scrutiny, the government’s policy must have narrow specificity, but
the government was unable to articulate exactly what speech was
proscribed.  Id. at 639.  Whether a doctor patient discussion of
medical marijuana constitutes a “recommendation” depends on how the patient
interprets the doctor’s words, which is not permissible under the First
Amendment.  Id. (citations
omitted).  The court stated that its
decision is consistent with principles of federalism that leave states as the
primary regulators of professional conduct. 
Id. (citations omitted).
Relying on Conant,
Smith concludes that, if restrictions on physician-patient communications are
an unconstitutional infringement on speech, certainly the 2021 Decision’s
restriction on his ability to advise medical providers on the intrathecal
therapy modality is unconstitutional.  The
2021 Decision does not merely restrict Smith from providing treatment
recommendations to patients as in Conant and lacks narrow specificity
because it prohibits him from “advising any medical provider” about the
modality.  The 2021 Decision’s discipline
was not based on evidence of incompetent advice to other medical providers.  The scope of this gag order is breathtaking
because it not only precludes Smith from providing treatment recommendation to
patients but also from referring his intrathecal therapy patients to other
physicians to ensure the continuity of their care.  It further prohibits Smith from advising
those referral physicians about the history of a patient’s intrathecal therapy
treatment and its rationale.  It also prohibits
Smith from teaching about a modality that he has used for more than three
decades and from publishing any case studies or other research concerning the
modality.  Pet. Op. Br. at 8-9.[5]
Smith adds that the
Supreme Court more recently issued an instructive decision in National
Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra, (“NIFLA”) (2018) 585
U.S. ___, 138 S. Ct. 2361.  In NIFLA,
the Supreme Court, considered a First Amendment challenge to the California
Reproductive Freedom, Accountability, Comprehensive Care, and Transparency Act
(“FACT Act”), which regulated pro-life centers that offer pregnancy-related
services.  Id. at
2365.  Licensed clinics were required notify women that California provides free or
low-cost services, including abortions, and give them a phone number.  Unlicensed clinics were required to notify
women that California had not licensed the clinics to provide medical services.
 Id.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed the denial of a
preliminary injunction against enforcement of the FACT Act, concluding that the
licensed notice survived a lower level of scrutiny applicable to the regulation
of “professional speech” and that the unlicensed notice survived any level of
scrutiny.  Id.
The Supreme Court noted
that First Amendment precedent distinguishes between content-based and
content-neutral regulations of speech.  Id.
at 2371.  As a general matter, content-based
laws “are presumptively unconstitutional” and may be justified only if narrowly
tailored to serve compelling state interests.  Id. (citation omitted).  The licensed notice was a content-based
regulation, requiring a particular message.  Id.  Although the licensed notice was
content-based, the Ninth Circuit did not apply strict scrutiny because it
concluded that the notice regulates “professional speech.”  Id. at 2371.  The high court has not recognized
professional speech as a separate category of speech.  Speech is not unprotected merely because it
is uttered by professionals.  Id.
at 2371-72.  The Court’s precedents have afforded
less protection to professional speech only in two categories: (a) laws that
require professionals to disclose factual, non-controversial information in
their commercial speech and (b) the regulation of professional conduct even
though that conduct incidentally involves speech.  Id at 2372.  The required notice was not limited to
“purely factual and uncontroversial information about" services.  Nor was it a regulation of professional
conduct that incidentally burdens speech; it applied to all interactions
between a covered facility and its patients, regardless of whether a medical
procedure is ever sought.  Id.  The unlicensed notice also unduly burdened
protected speech.  Id. at
2377.  Constraints on physician speech can
extend “no broader than reasonably necessary.” 
Id. (citations omitted). 

Smith argues that the
probation term restraining him from advising any medical provider on the care
or treatment of patients related to intrathecal pumps is constitutionally
infirm and of such overbreadth as to be dangerous for his patients who cannot
even be told about the intrathecal therapy modality’s availability in
connection with a referral to another pain management provider.  The Board had the ability to thoughtfully
craft its discipline of Smith.  If it had
wanted to, the Board could simply have prohibited him from providing intrathecal
therapy, at least temporarily until assured of his competence in the modality
as it had done in the 2020 Decision. 
Given the binary outcome options given to the court by CPP section
1094.5(f) -- i.e., either to set aside the 2021 Decision or deny the
writ -- the Board’s overstep is fatal to its discipline.  CCP section 1094.5(f) offers no alternative
but to set aside the 2021 Decision.  Pet.
Op. Br. at 10.
The Board relies
(Opp. at 15) on Pickup v. Brown,
(“Pickup”) (9th Cir. 2014) 740 F.3d 1208, 1221, which held
that a state law banning mental health providers from engaging in sexual
orientation change efforts with patients under 18 did not violate free speech
rights of doctors or patients.  The law regulated
professional speech for which First Amendment protections are somewhat
diminished and the law did not require heightened scrutiny.  Id. at 1227-28.   At one
end of a continuum, the First Amendment protection of a professional is
greatest where he or she advocates a treatment that the medical establishment
considers outside the mainstream, or even dangerous.  Id. at 1227.  At the midpoint of the continuum, within the
confines of the professional relationship, the First Amendment tolerates a
substantial amount of speech regulation within the professional-client
relationship that it would not tolerate outside of it.  Id. at 1228.  The law in question was at the other end of
the continuum, regulation of professional conduct, where the state’s power is
greatest even though such regulation may have an incidental effect on speech.  Id. at 1229.  The law at issue regulated conduct, did
nothing to prevent licensed therapists from discussing the pros and cons of
sexual orientation change with patients and simply prevented mental health
providers from engaging in it with minors. 
Id.  This limited reach was
lawful even though the treatment is performed through speech alone.  Id. at 1230. 
            Based
on Pickup, the Board argues that its 2021 Decision’s restriction
regulates “professional conduct”, and any burden it imposes on Smith’s speech
is incidental. The restriction is rationally related to a legitimate Board
interest in fulfilling its duty under B&P Code section 2229, which provides
that “[t]he Board has legal authority to place
restrictions on a licensee’s scope of practice”, “order restrictions as
are indicated by the evidence”, and “seek out those licensees who have
demonstrated deficiencies in competency and then take those actions as are
indicated…including further education, restrictions from practice…that will remove those deficiencies.” (emphasis added).  Opp. at 15.
            The
Board argues that it is restricting a doctor on probation for negligent medical
practice from advising medical
providers (including nurses and physician assistants) on the care or
treatment of patients for a specific
area of medical practice where serious deficiencies in his knowledge have been
established, and the practice restriction has been narrowly tailored to the evidence.  Two physicians, Dr. Thompson and Dr. Rouff, testified
for Smith. Both stated they managed intrathecal therapy pumps under Smith’s
direct supervision at his clinic.  AR
11119-24,11158-60.  Both stated that they
followed Smith’s treatment plan for intrathecal therapy pumps, and that he
advised them on drug formulas, concentrations, calculations, and dosage levels
of intrathecal fentanyl.  Id.  Dr. Thompson also testified that nurses frequently
received instruction from Smith on the maintenance and filling of intrathecal
therapy pumps at his clinic.  AR
11125-29.  This testimony shows that the
Board’s restriction against advising other medical providers is rationally
related to fulfilling its mandated duty of public protection.  Opp. at 15-16.
            Smith’s
provision of intrathecal therapy is contrary to applicable standards of
care.  This was established by Wallace’s
testimony, and he is a leading expert in this specialized area of medicine.
Smith doubled down on his sub-standard practice when he testified that he would
not change his dosage levels of intrathecal therapy fentanyl or his use of
ketamine in intrathecal therapy pumps if permitted by the Board to continue the
practice of intrathecal therapy.  Because
of its statutory duty of public protection, the Board has no choice but to
prohibit him from advising other medical providers on intrathecal therapy.  The Board cannot ignore the risk that will
imperil the safety of patients if Smith continues to perform intrathecal
therapy indirectly through
nurses, physician assistants, or other doctors employed at his clinic.  Opp. at 16.
The court agrees with the Board that it may
impose subject matter restrictions on Smith’s professional speech.  NIFLA noted that First Amendment
precedent distinguishes between content-based and content-neutral regulations
of speech and that content-based laws are presumptively unconstitutional and
may be justified only if narrowly tailored to serve compelling state interests.
 138 S. Ct. at 2371.  (citation omitted).  The high court added that speech is not
unprotected merely because it is uttered by professionals (id. at
2371-72), but the Court’s precedents have afforded less protection to
professional speech in two categories: (a) laws that require professionals to
disclose factual, non-controversial information in their commercial speech and
(b) the regulation of professional conduct even though that conduct
incidentally involves speech.  Id
at 2372.  
The Board is
authorized to impose restrictions on Smith’s practice under B&P Code
section 2229.  The probation term restricting Smith from advising
another medical provider about intrathecal therapy is a subject matter-based
restriction and is based on Smith’s lack of competence with respect to intrathecal
therapy.  The restriction is part of the
regulation of professional conduct where the state’s power is greatest, even
though such regulation may have an incidental effect on speech.  See Pickup, supra, 740 F.3d at
1229.  

However, constraints
on physician speech can extend “no broader than reasonably necessary.”  NIFLA, supra, 138 S. Ct. at
2377 (citations omitted).  Conant
stated that the violation of the First Amendment is blatant when the government
regulates particular views taken by speakers on a subject.  309 F.3d at 637 (citations omitted).  To survive First Amendment scrutiny, the
government’s policy must have narrow specificity.  Id. at 639.  The First Amendment protection of a
professional is greatest where he or she advocates a treatment that the medical
establishment considers outside the mainstream, or even dangerous.  Pickup, supra, 740 F.3d at
1227.  
When properly interpreted, the probation restriction on
Smith’s professional speech is narrowly tailored.  The restriction prohibits Smith from advising any medical
provider on the care or treatment of patients involving the use, management or
any surgical procedure related to intrathecal pumps.  AR 9860.[6]  The 2021 Decision concluded that “[p]ublic
protection would be served if during the duration of his probation under Case
No. 800-2015-013651 [Smith] is prohibited from performing intrathecal therapy
or consulting with other providers regarding intrathecal therapy.”  The term “consult” in the medical world has a
common meaning of a consultation between medical providers about a particular
patient’s ongoing or future care.  
The court interprets
the probation restriction against “advising” medical providers to mean that
Smith cannot consult with other medical providers about ongoing or future
intrathecal therapy for a particular patient. 
This interpretation fits well within the continuum referred to by Pickup
and addresses the Board’s
concern that Smith not continue to perform intrathecal therapy indirectly through nurses, physician
assistants, or other doctors employed at his clinic.  Smith is
not proscribed, however, from referring a patient to another provider for
intrathecal therapy.  Contrary to Smith’s
belief, the restriction also does prevent him from informing referral
physicians about the history of a patient’s intrathecal therapy treatment.  Nor does it prohibit Smith from teaching
about intrathecal therapy or publishing case studies or other research
concerning the modality.
To the extent that
the prohibition could be interpreted more broadly, the court should interpret
its scope to be narrowly tailored consistent with Smith’s First Amendment
rights as articulated in NIFLA, Conant, and Pickup.  As
interpreted, the restriction does not violate the First Amendment.
 
3. The 2021 Disciplinary Decision
Is Supported by the Weight of the Evidence 
It is well settled that the purpose of license discipline is
to protect the public, not to punish the licensee.  See
B&P Code §2229(a)-(c);
Camacho v. Youde, (1979) 95 Cal.App.3d 161, 164.  The propriety of a
penalty imposed by an administrative agency is a matter in the discretion of
the agency, and its decision may not be disturbed unless there has been a
manifest abuse of discretion.  Lake v. Civil Service Commission,
(1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 224, 228; Borden v. Division of Medical Quality,
(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 874, 884.  The policy
consideration underlying this allocation of authority is the expertise of the
administrative agency.  Cadilla v. Board of Medical Examiners, (1972) 26 Cal.App.3d
961.  “‘[T]he object of the
Board’s discipline ‘is not to punish’ the physician, but ‘rather, ‘to protect
the life, health and welfare of the people at large and to set up a plan
whereby those who practice medicine will have the qualifications which will
prevent, as far as possible, the evils which could result…In short, the purpose
of discipline is to make the [physician] a better physician.’”  Pirouzian v. Superior Court, (2016) 1
Cal. App. 5th 438, 446 (citations omitted); 

“Although the Department's discretion with respect to the
penalty is broad, it does not have absolute and unlimited power. It is
bound to exercise legal discretion.…The discretion intended, however, is not a
capricious or arbitrary discretion, but an impartial discretion, guided and
controlled in its exercise by fixed legal principles.  Harris v.
Alcoholic Bev. Etc. Appeals Bd., (1965) 62 Cal. 2d 589, 594-95 (acts over
eight-day period of serving beer to minors, serving wine to investigators, and
serving beer to intoxicated person, although imputed to the licensee, were not
of nature requiring license revocation). 
See also Magit v.
Board of Medical Examiners, (1961) 57 Cal. 2d 74, 88 (in determining whether agency abused its
discretion, trial court must consider all the circumstances, including that
revocation of medical license would prevent medical doctor from being gainfully
occupied in his profession).
Where the administrative burden of proof is clear and
convincing evidence, the trial court must account for that standard of proof
when exercising its independent judgment on the sufficiency of the
evidence.  Li v. Superior Court
(Sacramento County), supra, 69 Cal.App.5th at 865.   The trial court must apply the
principles of deference and presumptive correctness in the context of whether
the findings are supported by clear and convincing evidence rather than a mere
preponderance of the evidence.  Id.
The court may not substitute its judgment on the proper
penalty in place of the discretion of the administrative agency.  Nightingale v.
State Personnel Board, (1972) 7 Cal.3d 507, 515; Deegan v. City
of Mountain View, (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 37, 45. 
“If reasonable minds may differ as to the propriety of the penalty
imposed, there has been no abuse of discretion. 
It is only in the exceptional case, when it is shown that reasonable
minds cannot differ on the propriety of the penalty, that an abuse of discretion
is shown.”  Id. at 46-47
(citations omitted).
Smith notes that the
2021 Decision was based on care provided to Patients A-C between 2015 and
2018.  AR 9777-95 (Patient A); AR 9812-23
(Patient B); AR 9829-31 (Patient C).  The
2020 Decision was likewise based on care provided to patients between 2015 and
2018, or well-before that period.  AR 3316-21
(Patient A between 2011-2017); AR 3338-63 (Patient B between 2011-2013); AR 3363
(Patient C between 2008-2012), AR 3369 (Patient D between 2011-2012); AR 3375
(Patient E between April-October 2013). 
Both the 2021 and 2020 Decisions evaluated Smith’s competency and
quality of care in treating patients with the intrathecal therapy modality, and
the 2020 Decision discipline included a probation restriction prohibiting Smith
from performing any care or treatment with patients involving intrathecal pumps
until after successful completion of Clinical Competence Assessment Program had
been provided to the Board.  AR 3910.
Smith argues that he
satisfied the 2020 Decision’s competence assessment requirement and was permitted
to again provide the intrathecal therapy modality.  Smith called his Board probation officer to
testify at the hearing on the 2020 Accusation, and he confirmed Smith’s compliance
with his probation.  AR 11169-74.  The Board acknowledged the restoration of Smith’s
right to perform intrathecal therapy after a determination of competency in the
2021 Decision: Smith “has fully complied with the terms of his probation, he completed
a clinical competency course, and has been subject to monitoring.”  AR 9775-76, 9859 (emphasis added).  Pet. Op. Br. at 10-11.
Despite this, the
Board purported to restore its ban on Smith’s ability to provide patients with intrathecal
therapy care in the 2021 Decision, imposed through a permanent restriction
during probation.  AR 9858-59.  This ban was based on evidence from Smith’s
practice before the Board restored his ability to treat patients with
the intrathecal therapy modality.  AR 9859.  The chronology of the Board’s actions is:  (a) in 2020, the Board took away Smith’s
faculty to provide intrathecal therapy treatment until he had completed a
clinical competency program as a term of his probation based on treatment
provided to patients between 2011 and 2018; (b) Smith completed the clinical
competency program; (c) the Board restored Smith’s ability to provide
intrathecal therapy treatment; and (d) in the 2021 Decision, the Board again
took away Smith’s faculty to provide intrathecal therapy treatment until the
end of his probation based on treatment provided to patients between 2015 and
2018.  Pet. Op. Br. at 12; Reply at 7.
Despite its findings
of restored competency, despite evaluating Smith’s competency during the same
period of care, and despite having already disciplined Smith based on his use
of the intrathecal therapy modality for the same period, the Board again
disciplined him in the 2021 Decision. 
This is capricious and dangerous. 
Any physician who treated his patients under a misapprehension or
misapplication of professional standards could endure years of repeated
accusations and discipline simply by the Board serially selecting one or a
group of patients at a time to prosecute each accusation.  This is not what the Medical Practice Act
contemplates.  As a result, the 2021
Decision’s intrathecal therapy ban is punishment, not discipline, and the 2021
Decision must be set aside as lacking clear and convincing evidence to a
reasonable degree of certainty.  Pet. Op.
Br. at 11-12.
Smith’s argument of potential abuse is a fair one.  The Complainant could piecemeal a physician’s
treatment of a number of patients over a single period into a series of
accusations, seeking greater and greater discipline in a circumstance that should
be a single accusation.  This potential
for abuse is real, and multiple accusations should be subject to scrutiny.
But that is not what happened in Smith’s two cases.  He is correct that the 2021 Decision
concerned the treatment of three patients between the years 2015 and 2018.  He is also correct that the 2020 Decision
concerned the treatment of five patients between the years 2011 and 2017.  It is also accurate to note the 2020 Decision
imposed a temporary restriction
on Smith’s ability to practice intrathecal therapy whereas the 2021 Decision
imposed a restriction for the duration of his probation.
However, the 2019 Accusation underlying the 2020 Decision
and the 2020 Accusation underlying the 2021 Decision did not involve the same intrathecal therapy issues
during the same period of medical care.  Comparing
the two records shows that the intrathecal therapy deficiencies in front of the
Board for the 2021 Decision were fundamentally different and significantly more
serious than in the 2019 Accusation.  
The 2019 Accusation and the 2020 Decision were predominantly
based on violations of over-prescribing oral pain medication.  AR 3144.  The 2019 Accusation alleged intrathecal
therapy violations for only one of the five patients, Patient A, and mostly
centered around a single office visit in 2012 for which Smith failed to
properly program medication information into Patient A’s pump.  AR 3151-52. 
This was not a primary allegation, and the 2019 Accusation did not allege any violations concerning
psychological evaluations, use of intrathecal ketamine, or routine use of
excessively high doses of intrathecal fentanyl. 
Allegations in connection with intrathecal therapy were made for the
first time in the 2020 Accusation and addressed by the Board in the 2021
Decision.[7] 
The Board also argues that Smith’s chronology is
misleading.  He implies that his
probation monitor’s testimony is proof that he again was permitted to provide
the intrathecal therapy modality.  Smith testified
that he had received direct communication from the Board that he would be able
to resume intrathecal therapy “in the next couple of weeks.”  AR 11041.  No other evidence was provided at the hearing
to support this claim.  The probation
monitor testified only that she had received an email from Smith that he had
completed the clinical competency program.  AR 11170. 
The probation monitor did not know whether in fact he had completed the
program because she had not yet received a final report from the program.  Id.
 Opp. at 17-18.
The court assumes that Smith has completed the clinical
competency program (see rejected RJN Ex. F), but that does not make him
competent.  Smith’s competency in
intrathecal therapy is best evaluated by his testimony in which he rejected
Wallace’s assertion that his dosing levels of intrathecal fentanyl were
excessive and fell below the standard of care. 
AR 10990-91.  He testified that, if
the Board permits him to work on intrathecal pumps in the future, he will not
decrease the dosage.  AR 10991.  He also rejected Wallace’s opinion as to the
use of intrathecal ketamine in pumps.  AR
10991.  If the Board permits him to work
with intrathecal pumps, he will continue to use ketamine in those pumps.  AR 10991. 
The 2021 Decision was based in part on the fact that Smith’s testimony
shows that he will continue a dangerous and harmful brand of intrathecal
therapy in the absence of a practice restriction.  
Smith fail to show the Board’s 2021 Decision to impose a
practice restriction lacked clear and convincing evidence and was capricious.  The 2021 Decision is based upon evidentiary
findings of dangerous conduct which warrant a greater practice restriction than
imposed in the 2020 Decision.  Smith fails
to show that the practice restriction is not justified by substantial evidence.  
 
F. Conclusion
The Petition is denied. 
The Board’s counsel is ordered to prepare a proposed judgment, serve it
on Smith’s counsel for approval as to form, wait ten days after service for any
objections, meet and confer if there are objections, and then submit the
proposed judgment along with a declaration stating the existence/non-existence
of any unresolved objections.  An OSC re:
judgment is set for February 13, 2024 at 1:30 p.m.
