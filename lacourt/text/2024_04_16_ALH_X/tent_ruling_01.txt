RELIEF
REQUESTED 
 
             Defendant demurrers to Plaintiff’s
complaint. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
             This case arises out of Plaintiff John Doe’s
(“Plaintiff”) claim that he was the victim of childhood sexual assault during
1972 and 1973. Plaintiff filed this complaint pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 340.1 on July 29, 2022. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
             
Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s complaint is OVERRULED. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
A general
demurrer may be taken to a complaint where “[t]he pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action.” (Code of Civ. Proc. § 430.10(e).) A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the
complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn
v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal. App. 4th 740, 747.) In a demurrer proceeding, the
defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or by proper judicial
notice.  (Code Civ. Proc. section
430.30(a).)  A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or
other extrinsic matters.  (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153
Cal. App. 3d 902, 905.)  The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is
whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action.  (Hahn v.
Mirda, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
 
Additionally, a
special demurrer to a complaint may be brought on the ground the pleading is
uncertain, ambiguous, or unintelligible. Code Civ. Proc section 430.10(f); Beresford Neighborhood Assn. v. City of
San Mateo (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1180, 1191.) A demurrer based
on uncertainty is disfavored and will be strictly construed even when the
pleading is uncertain in some respects. (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993) 14
Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) A demurrers based on uncertainty are “granted only if
the pleading is so incomprehensible that a defendant cannot reasonably
respond.” (Lickiss v. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (2012) 208
Cal.App.4th 1125, 1135.) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Claim Presentation and
Constitutional Challenge to Section 340.1
 
            Defendant argues that Paintiff’s
claims fail because he has failed to make a claim as required by the Government
Claims Act and any statutory exemption violates the California Constitution’s
prohibition on unlawful gifts. 
 
“Under the Government Claims Act,
personal injury claims against public entities generally must be presented to
the entity within six months of accrual of the injury. [Citation.] Absent an
applicable exception, ‘failure to timely present a claim for money or damages
to a public entity bars a plaintiff from filing a lawsuit against that entity.’
” (Coats v. New Haven Unified School District (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 415,
420.)
 
            At the time Plaintiff filed this
action, Code of Civil Procedure former section 340.1, subdivision (q),
provided: “Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any claim for damages
described in paragraphs (1) through (3, inclusive, of subdivision (a) that has
not been litigated to finality and that would otherwise be barred as of January
1, 2020, because the applicable statute of limitations, claim presentation
deadline, or any other time limit had expired, is revived, and these claims may
be commenced within three years of January 1, 2020.” Further, Government Code
section 905, subdivision (m), provides an exception for the claim presentation
requirements for “[c]laims made pursuant to Section 340.1 of the Code of
Civil Procedure for the recovery of damages suffered as a result of
childhood sexual assault.”
 
            Defendants,
citing a slew of cases from the 19th century and early 20th century, contend
that the statutory exception to the claim presentation requirement is an
unlawful gift because Plaintiff, having failed to make a claim at the
appropriate time, no longer has an enforceable claim. The issue then, is
whether section 340.1, in conjunction with Government Code section 905, is an
unlawful gift of public funds.
 
“ ‘Section 6 of article XVI of the California Constitution provides
that the Legislature has no power “to make any gift or authorize the making of
any gift, of any public money or thing of value to any individual, municipal or
other corporation ....” The term “gift” in the constitutional provision
“includes all appropriations of public money for which there is no authority or
enforceable claim,” even if there is a moral or equitable obligation.’ ” (In
re William M.W. (2019) 43 Cal.App.5th 573, 594.)
 
In Bourn v. Hart (1892) 93 Cal.321, 326, a case cited by Defendant, the petitioner had
sought to enforce an act of legislation that specifically stated he would
personally be the recipient of funds. The Court held “[a] legislative
appropriation made to an individual in payment of a claim for damages on
account of personal injuries sustained by him while in its service, and for
which the state is not responsible, either upon general principles of law or by
reason of some previous statute creating such liability, is a gift, within the
meaning of the constitution.” (Id. at p. 328.)
 
            In Powell
v. Phelan (1903) 138 Cal. 271, 273, the legislature had sought to
retroactively provide jurors who had served 
on criminal trials access to payment. The Court held that such an act
was an unlawful gift. (Ibid.) “It is for the purpose of giving to
certain jurors who have served in criminal cases since March 28, 1895,
money to which they were not entitled under the law. They do not sustain any
contractual relation to the city and county. There is no legal liability in any
manner upon the part of the city and county to pay them.” (Id. at p.
273-74.) 
 
            Defendant
correctly notes that “a claim presentation requirement constitutes an element of
any cause of action subject to the act.” (California-American Water Co. v.
Marina Coast Water Dist.(2022) 86 Cal.App.5th 1272, 1287.) However,
Defendant’s argument that section 340.1 violates the California Constitution is
unavailing. In the cases cited by Defendant, the legislature had passed an act
requiring issuance of funds in circumstances where there had previously been no
grounds for enforceable claims. In Powell, supra, the Court noted that
the funds were a result of neither a contract nor legal liability. (138 Cal. At
pp. 273-74.) 
 
However, here, there is a basis for
liability. Section 340.1 does not create a new basis for liability but rather
impacts parts of a preexisting basis for liability. Further, as stated by the
Court in Coats, supra, “the Legislature made clear its intent to revive
causes of action previously barred by government claims presentation
requirements.” (46 Cal.App.5th 415, 428.) “The present case, of course,
involves revival of a cause of action barred by a claim presentation
requirement, not a statute of limitations. But we are aware of no reason
the Legislature should be any less able to revive claims in this context, as it
expressly did in Assembly Bill 218[.]” (Ibid.) Although the issue before
the court in Coats was a different constitutional challenge, the Court
upheld the legislature’s ability to revive claims barred by the claim
presentation requirement, which is applicable here.
 
Defendant’s arguments that section
340.1 constitute an unlawful gift are rejected, and Defendant’s demurrer on
those grounds are overruled.
 
Duplicative Cause of Action
 
Defendant also contends that
Plaintiff’s fourth cause of action is duplicative. 
 
            In Palm
Springs Villas II Homeowners Assn., Inc v. Parth (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th
268, 290, the Court, citing Rodriguez v. Campbell Industries (1978) 87
Cal.App.3d 494, 501, stated that duplicative causes of action were grounds for
sustaining a demurrer. In Rodriguez, supra, the Court sustained a
demurrer for a cause of action that “combine[d] all the preceding causes, alleging they
are joint and concurrent causes of plaintiffs' damages.” (877 Cal.App.3d at p.
498.) The Rodriguez Court held that the deficient cause of action
“contain[ed], by necessary implication, all of the allegations of each of the
preceding four alleged causes and thus adds nothing to the complaint by way of
fact or theory of recovery.” (Id. at p. 501.)
 
            Plaintiff’s
fourth cause of action alleges that Defendants and their employees failed to
comply with their requirements as mandated reporters. (Complaint ¶¶ 49-51.) Plaintiff’s fourth cause of action presents a
factually distinct basis for his claims and is thus not so duplicative as to
add “nothing to the complaint by way of fact or theory of recovery.” (Rodriguez,
supra, 87 Cal.App.3d at p. 501.) 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s complaint is OVERRULED.   Defendant is ordered to file an ANSWER within
10 days’ notice of this ruling.
 
 
            Plaintiff
to give notice.
