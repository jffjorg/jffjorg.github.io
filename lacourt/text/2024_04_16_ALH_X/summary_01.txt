Here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling in a case between John Doe, the plaintiff, and Doe #1, the defendant. The case revolves around Doe's claim that he was a victim of childhood sexual assault in 1972 and 1973. The defendant has demurred to the complaint, arguing that the plaintiff failed to present his claim within the required timeframe and that the statutory exception to the claim presentation requirement is an unlawful gift. The court has overruled the demurrer and ordered the defendant to file an answer within 10 days. The court held that section 340.1 of the Code of Civil Procedure does not create a new basis for liability but rather impacts parts of a preexisting basis for liability.
