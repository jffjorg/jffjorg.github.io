And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Plaintiffs Denise Fuller and Cedris Bunnn Jr. against Defendants Henry Boorstin and William Boorstin. The demurrer is sustained, with 20 days' leave to amend, on the grounds that certain affirmative defenses filed by the Defendants fail to state facts sufficient to constitute a defense or are uncertain. The Judge found that several of the affirmative defenses, including those for waiver and estoppel, laches, unclean hands, breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing, violation of Civil Code statutes, offset, and failure to fulfill obligations under an alleged contract, do not plead sufficient facts to support their claims. The Judge requires the Defendants to provide additional facts to support their defenses.
