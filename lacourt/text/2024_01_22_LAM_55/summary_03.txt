And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has denied the motion to quash service of summons filed by SBE Ent Holdings, LLC (Defendant) on the grounds that the court has personal jurisdiction over it. The court found that the defendant has significant contacts with California, including being the guarantor under the 2011 guarantee agreement and conducting business in the state for several years prior to 2021. The court also considered the 2021 settlement agreement between the parties, which states that the defendant is the guarantor under the guarantee agreement and subjects it to the jurisdiction of California courts. The court concluded that exercising jurisdiction over the defendant is reasonable and therefore denied the motion to quash.
