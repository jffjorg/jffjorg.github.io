Summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction. The plaintiffs, John Gallagher and Juliana Gallagher, sought to prevent the transfer of ownership interest in the subject property, alleging that they were denied the opportunity to bid at the foreclosure sale and that the sale was void due to a lack of notice. The defendants, Wilshire Investment Group, LLC and Brentwood Real Estate Group, argued that they were bona fide purchasers of the property and that the plaintiffs' claims were barred.

The judge found that the evidence showed that Wilshire was a bona fide purchaser, having paid value for the property without notice of any adverse interest or irregularity in the sale proceedings. The judge also found that the plaintiffs had not demonstrated a likelihood of prevailing on the merits of their claims, as the evidence did not show that the defendants had notice of the plaintiffs' claims prior to the sale.

The judge declined to rule on the defendants' objections to the declarations of John Gallagher, as the evidence was not material to the ruling. The case will proceed to further discovery and a trial on the merits of the plaintiffs' claims.
