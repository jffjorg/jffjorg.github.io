(“Plaintiffs”)  RESPONDING PARTY: none NOTICE: ok    RELIEF  REQUESTED: An  order from this Court granting Plaintiffs leave to file their Amendment to the  Complaint to add two additional plaintiffs Anahi Ramirez-Bernal and Alejandro  Lopez.   TENTATIVE  RULING: The  motion is GRANTED.   BACKGROUND   On July 26, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their Complaint against Defendants Canyon Country Mobile Home Estates, LLC, and  J&H Asset Property MGT., Inc., and Does 1-50 (collectively, “Defendants”),  alleging the following causes of action: (1)  nuisance; (2) breach of contract; (3) breach of the covenant of good faith and  fair dealing; (4) negligence; (5) breach of statutes; (6) breach of warranty of  habitability; (7) breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment; (8) breach of unfair  competition law; and (9) declaratory and injunctive relief. The Complaint  alleges that Plaintiffs, who are current and former residents and/or owners of mobilehomes  located in Canyon County Mobile Home Estates, a mobile home park situated at  16274 Vasquez Canyon Rd. Canyon Country, CA 91351 (the “Park”), have suffered  damages due to Defendants’ alleged failure to properly manage and maintain the  Park.    On November 9, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the instant Motion for  Order Granting Leave to File Amendment to the Complaint (the “Motion”). Subsequently,  on April 2, 2024, Plaintiffs submitted their Reply and Notice of  Non-Opposition.   No opposing papers have been received by the Court.   ANALYSIS   Under Code of Civil Procedure  section 473 subdivision (a), “ The court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any  terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading or proceeding by  adding or striking out the name of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the  name of a party, or a mistake in any other respect; and may, upon like terms,  enlarge the time for answer or demurrer. The court may likewise, in its  discretion, after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may be  just, an amendment to any pleading or proceeding in other particulars; and may  upon like terms allow an answer to be made after the time limited by this  code.”   Additionally, Code of Civil  Procedure section 576 provides, “Any judge, at any time before or after commencement of trial,  in the furtherance of justice, and upon such terms as may be proper, may allow  the amendment of any pleading or pretrial conference order."   A.     Leave to  File Amendment to the Complaint   The court, in the interest of justice  and under proper terms, may permit a party to amend any pleading. (Code Civ.  Proc., sections 473, 576.) Judicial policy favors resolution of all disputed  matters between the parties and, therefore, leave to amend is generally  liberally granted. (Howard v. County of San Diego (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th  1422, 1428.) Ordinarily, the court will not consider the validity of the  proposed amended pleading in ruling on a motion for leave since grounds for a  demurrer or motion to strike are premature. (Kittredge Sports Co. v.  Superior Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1048.)   The application for leave to amend  should be made as soon as the need to amend is discovered. (See Cal. Rules of  Court, Rule 3.1324(b)(3)-(4) [separate declaration accompanying the motion must  specify when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered  and why the request for amendment was not made earlier].) The closer the trial  date, the stronger the showing required for leave to amend. (See Duchrow v.  Forrest (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1359, 1377-78.) If the party seeking the  amendment has been dilatory, and the delay has prejudiced the opposing party,  the court has the discretion to deny leave to amend. (Hirsa v. Superior  Court (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 486, 490.) Prejudice exists where the amendment  would unreasonably delay trial, resulting in added costs of preparation and  increased discovery burdens, or result in loss of critical evidence. (Miles  v. City of Los Angeles (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 728, 739; P&D  Consultants, Inc. v. City of Carlsbad (2010) 190 Cal.App.4th 1332, 1345; Solit  v. Tokai Bank, Ltd. New York Branch (1999) 68 Cal.App.4th 1435, 1448; Magpali  v. Farmers Group, Inc. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471, 486-488.   Here, Plaintiffs seek the  Court’s permission to amend their Complaint to include two additional  plaintiffs Ahahi Ramirez-Bernal and Alejandro Lopez (the “Potential  Plaintiffs”). (Mem. of P. & A., at 3.) Plaintiffs present that these two  Potential Plaintiffs contacted Plaintiffs’ counsel’s law firm with the  intention to be added to the action after learning of the filing of the  Complaint. (Paris Decl., ¶ 5.)   Furthermore, Plaintiffs’  counsel’s declaration states that the Potential Plaintiffs’ claims are the same  or similar to those made by the Plaintiffs in this action as they arise from  the same alleged failure of Defendants to maintain the Park. (Paris Decl., ¶  6.) Plaintiffs’ counsel has met and conferred with Defendants’ counsel  regarding the subject of the instant Motion and proposed stipulation to amend  the Complaint. However, Plaintiffs could not agree to Defendants’ proposed  revisions to their stipulation, necessitating the filing of the Motion. (Id.,  ¶¶ 5-10.)   Plaintiffs contend  that there is no unreasonable delay in filing the Motion. (Mem. of P. & A.,  at 5.)   The Court agrees.  Here, the original Complaint was filed on July 26, 2023. After being contacted  by the Potential Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs’ counsel has made efforts to meet and  confer Defendants’ counsel since October 4, 2023. (Paris Decl., ¶ 7.) Given the  failure to reach a stipulation, Plaintiffs filed the instant Motion on November  9, 2023, less than three months after the filing of the original Complaint.  Consequently, the Court determines that there is no unreasonable delay in  bringing the Motion.     Plaintiffs argue that granting the motion  would not result in prejudice to the Defendants as they will have sufficient  time to conduct any necessary discovery regarding the two Potential Plaintiffs  prior to the trial. (Paris Decl., ¶¶ 5-6.) Given the current stage of the  proceedings and no trial dates having been set, the Court identifies no basis  for prejudice towards Defendants. On the contrary, the amendment will serve the  interests of justice and preclude multiple similar actions involving identical  issues of fact and law.   Therefore,  the unopposed Motion for Order Granting Leave to File Amendment to the  Complaint is GRANTED.   CONCLUSION   Plaintiffs’  Motion is GRANTED.    The  Court orders Plaintiffs to file the Amendment to Complaint within 10 days.   Moving  party to provide notice.
