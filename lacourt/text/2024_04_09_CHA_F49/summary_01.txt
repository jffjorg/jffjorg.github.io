And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion for leave to file an amendment to the complaint to add two additional plaintiffs, Ahahi Ramirez-Bernal and Alejandro Lopez. The judge finds that there is no unreasonable delay in bringing the motion, as the original complaint was filed on July 26, 2023, and the motion was filed on November 9, 2023. The judge also determines that granting the motion will not result in prejudice to the defendants, as they will have sufficient time to conduct any necessary discovery regarding the two additional plaintiffs prior to the trial. The judge orders the plaintiffs to file the amended complaint within 10 days.
