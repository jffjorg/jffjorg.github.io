And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Defendant's motion to continue the trial, which was set for November 6, 2024. The new trial date is set for early July 2025. The motion was filed due to Defendant's timely-filed motion for summary judgment, which is set for hearing on May 27, 2025. The judge finds that Defendant has a right to have its timely-filed motion for summary judgment heard before trial, and that the continuance is necessary to allow for this to occur. The judge also notes that Plaintiff's concerns about prejudice from delay are understood, but that the right of Defendant to have its motion heard before trial takes precedence.
