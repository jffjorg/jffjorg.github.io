Background
On March 21,
2022, Walter E. Jones and Yahne Coleman (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a
complaint against Six Flags Magic Mountain, Inc., Six Flags Magic Mountain
Limited Partnership, and Does 1 through 10. Plaintiffs assert that they were violently
attacked while attending an event at an amusement park on June 29, 2021.
On May 3, 2022,
Plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint (“FAC”). In the FAC, Plaintiffs name
as defendants Six Flags Theme Parks Inc., Six Flags Entertainment Corporation,
and Does 1 through 10 and assert causes of action for (1) premises liability,
(2) negligence in training, retention, and supervision, and (3) negligent
infliction of emotional distress. 
On May 27, 2022,
Plaintiffs amended the FAC to name Magic Mountain, LLC as Doe 1. 
On March 27,
2023, Magic Mountain, LLC (“Defendant”) filed its answer.
On February 28, 2024, Defendant filed this
motion for summary judgment. 
No opposition has been filed.
Legal Standard
“The purpose
of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut
through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their
allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil
Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), “requires the trial judge to grant
summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably
deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or
evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of
the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the
issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether
there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the
pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67,
citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367,
381-382.)
As to each
cause of action as framed by the complaint, a defendant moving for summary
judgment or summary adjudication must satisfy the initial burden of proof by
presenting facts to show “that one or more elements of the cause of action ...
cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of
action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra,
25 Cal.4th at pp. 850-851; Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Once the defendant has met that burden, the burden
shifts to the plaintiff to show that a “triable issue of one or more material
facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp.
850-851.)
A plaintiff or
cross-complainant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication must
satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to show “that there is
no defense to a cause of action if that party has proved each element of the
cause of action entitling the party to judgment on the cause of action.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) Once the plaintiff or cross-complainant has
met that burden, the burden shift to the defendant or cross-defendant to show
that a “triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of
action or a defense thereto.” (Ibid.)
The party
opposing a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication may not simply
“rely upon the allegations or denials of its pleadings” but must instead “set
forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subds. (p)(1) & (p)(2). To establish a triable
issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial
responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151,
166.)
Courts
“liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary
judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore
v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
Discussion
Plaintiffs attended a private party event at Six
Flags Magic Mountain amusement park on June 29, 2021, arriving at approximately
9 pm. (Defendant’s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts [“DSUMF”], No. 2.)
Plaintiffs and two of Plaintiffs’ friends were, according to Plaintiffs,
attacked by another group of approximately five park guests. (DSUMF, No. 5; Defendant’s
Exhibit C [“Jones Depo.”] at 144:7-21, 148:8-10, 148:23-149:15; Defendant’s Exhibit
D [“Coleman Depo.”], at 53:24-54:5, 55:4-11.) According to the Park’s security
log, security received a call about a fight at 11:55 pm, security was
dispatched at 11:57 pm, and when security arrived at 11:58 the fight had
already stopped. (DSUMF, No. 6.) 
In their FAC, Plaintiffs assert three causes of
action: (1) premises liability (negligence); (2) negligence in hiring,
training, retention, and supervision; and (3) negligent infliction of emotional
distress. 
Defendant moves for summary judgment, arguing
that as to the three causes of action, all of which sound in negligence, (1)
Defendant had no duty to prevent third-party criminal assaults against
Plaintiffs; (2) Defendant did not breach any duty; and (3) any breach of duty
by Defendant was not a substantial factor in causing the assault and the resulting
harm to Plaintiffs.
Beginning with the first cause of action, the basic elements of
negligence and for premises liability are the same: (1) the existence of a
legal duty; (2) breach of
that duty; (3) causation; and (4) resulting damages. (Brown v. USA
Taekwondo (2021) 11 Cal.5th 204, 213; Kesner v. Superior Court (2016) 1 Cal.5th 1132, 1158; Castellon v. U.S. Bancorp
(2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 994, 998.) The existence and scope of duty are legal questions
for the court.¿¿(Brown, supra, 11 Cal.5th at p. 213; Annocki¿v.
Peterson Enterprises, LLC¿(2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 32, 36.)
Pursuant to Civil Code section 1714,
subdivision (a), “Everyone is responsible ... for an injury occasioned to
another by his or her want of ordinary care or skill in the management of his
or her property or person ....” This statute establishes the default rule that
each person has a duty “to exercise, in his or her activities, reasonable care
for the safety of others.” (Brown, supra, at pp. 213-214.)
Those who own,
possess, or control property generally have a duty to exercise ordinary care in
managing the property to avoid exposing others to an unreasonable risk of harm.
(Annocki, supra, 232 Cal.App.4th at p. 37.) If a dangerous condition exists, the
property owner is “under a duty to exercise ordinary care either to make the
condition reasonably safe for their [customers’] use or to give a warning
adequate to enable them to avoid the harm.” (Bridgman v. Safeway Stores,
Inc. (1960) 53 Cal.2d 443, 446.) Although a business owner “is not an insurer of the safety of its
patrons, the owner does owe them a duty to exercise reasonable care in keeping
the premises reasonably safe.” (Ortega v. Kmart Corp. (2001) 26 Cal.4th
1200, 1205.) 
A business owner owes “a duty to undertake
“reasonable steps to secure common areas against foreseeable criminal acts of
third parties that [were] likely to occur in the absence of such precautionary
measures” and to take such “appropriate action as is reasonable under the
circumstances to protect patrons.” (Delgado v. Trax Bar & Grill (2005)
36 Cal.4th 224, 244.)
In the second cause of action, Plaintiffs assert that Defendant was
negligent in hiring, retaining, supervising, or training. “California case law
recognizes the theory that an employer can be liable to a third person for
negligently hiring, supervising, or retaining an unfit employee.” (Doe v.
Capital Cities (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1038, 1054; accord Evan F. v.
Hughson United Methodist Church (1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 828, 836.) The
elements of the tort are that (1) defendant hired an employee; (2) the employee
was or became unfit to perform the work for which they were fired; (3)
defendant knew or should have known that the employee was or became unfit and
that this unfitness created a particular risk to others; (4) that the employee’s
unfitness harmed plaintiffs; and (5) that the defendant’s negligence in hiring,
supervising, training, or retaining the employee was a substantial factor in
causing plaintiffs’ harm. (See Phillips v. TLC Plumbing (2009) 172
Cal.App.4th 1133, 1139; Mendoza v. City of Los Angeles (1998) 66
Cal.App.4th 1333, 1339; Federico v. Superior Court¿(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th
1207, 1213-1214; CACI No. 426.)  
In the third cause of
action, Plaintiffs assert that Defendant negligently inflicted emotional distress,
but in this context, there is no separate cause of action
for negligent infliction of emotional distress. “Negligent infliction of emotional distress is not an
independent tort, but the tort of negligence, to which traditional elements of
duty, breach of duty, causation, and damages apply.” (Downey v. City of
Riverside (2024) 16 Cal.5th 539, 547 [quoting Burgess v. Super. Ct.
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1064, 1072].) When a plaintiff has suffered physical injuries
caused by the negligence of the defendant, the cause of action is for
negligence, and the plaintiff can recover not only for the physical injuries
but also for the emotional distress associated with the incident.  
Here, Plaintiffs assert that Defendant’s negligence,
and/or its negligent hiring, retention, training, and supervision of Defendant’s
employees, allowed or otherwise was a substantial factor in bringing about the
assault that occurred and Plaintiffs’ resulting injuries. (See FAC, ¶¶ 14,
23-24, 27-28, 31, 35.) But Defendant has presented evidence that it had
adequate and properly trained security personnel present at the event, including
roving guards posted throughout the park, and that Los Angeles County Sheriff’s
Deputies were posted in the parking lot and also patrolled the premises during
the event. (DSUMF, No. 4 & supporting evidence.) According to the evidence in
the record, Defendant’s security personnel responded within three minutes of
the first report of the fight. (DSUMF, No. 6.) 
This evidence
is sufficient for Defendant to satisfy its initial burden of proof on summary
judgment of presenting facts to show “that one or more elements of the cause of
action ... cannot be established.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) This
shifts the burden to plaintiff to show that a “triable issue of one or more
material facts exists as to the cause of action.” (Ibid.) Plaintiffs have
not filed any opposition, and so they have not met their burden of establishing
that there are triable issues as to any breach of duty by Defendant.
Therefore, Defendant’s motion
for summary judgment is granted.
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion for summary
judgment.
Moving Party is to give notice.
