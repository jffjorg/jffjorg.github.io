23STCV23227
Defendant’s Motion for Terminating Sanctions
Tentative
The motion is denied without prejudice on
procedural grounds.
Background
On September 26,
2023, Kameron Jackson (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against The Kroger Co. dba
Ralphs, asserting causes of action for premises liability and negligence arising
out of slip and fall on September 5, 2022. 
 
On October 27,
2023, Ralphs Grocery Company dba Ralphs (erroneously
sued as The Kroger Co. dba Ralphs) (“Defendant”) filed an answer.
 
On May 29, 2024, the Court (the Hon. Michelle C. Kim) granted
Defendant’s motions to compel Plaintiff to provide initial responses to form
interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production.  The Court also ordered Plaintiff to pay monetary
sanctions. 
 
On June 24, 2024, the case was transferred to Department
29 of the Spring Street Courthouse.  
 
On July 8, 2024, Defendant
filed a motion for terminating and other sanctions.  The motion was initially set for
hearing in Department 31 on September 12 but was then reset by moving party for
hearing in Department 29 on October 9.  
 
On September 11,
2024, Defendant filed a new motion for terminating and other sanctions.  The motion was set for hearing in Department
29 on October 9.  
 
No opposition has
been filed. 
Legal Standard
When a plaintiff fails to obey an order compelling answers to
interrogatories, “the court may make those orders that
are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction,
or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010).  In lieu of or in addition to,
that sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)
When a plaintiff fails to obey an order compelling responses to
requests for production, “the court may
make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction,
an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).  In lieu of or in
addition to, that sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, section 2023.030 provides
for monetary, evidence, issue, and terminating sanctions for any “misuse of the
discovery process,” “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter governing any
particular discovery method or any other provision of this title.”  A “misuse of
the discovery process” is defined to include (among other things) failing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery; making, without
substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an
evasive response to a discovery request; disobeying a court order to provide
discovery; and making or opposing, unsuccessfully, a motion to compel without
substantial justification. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d)-(h).)
The Civil Discovery Act provides for an escalating and
“incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions
and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Lopez v. Watchtower
Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th
566, 604.) Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to and commensurate
with the misconduct, and they “should not exceed that which is required to
protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Doppes
v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) “If a lesser
sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted: continuing
misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until
the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.” (Ibid.; see also,
e.g., Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th
262, 279-280.) 
Terminating sanctions should be used sparingly. (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992; R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999)
75 Cal. App. 4th 486, 496.) “Although in extreme cases a court has the
authority to order a terminating sanction as a first measure, a terminating
sanction should generally not be imposed until the court has attempted less
severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly
shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective.” (Lopez, supra, 246
Cal.App.4th at p. 604.)  But where discovery violations are
“willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the
trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) Repeated and willful violations of discovery orders
that prejudice the opposing party may warrant a terminating sanction. (Creed-21
v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702; Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390; Biles
v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327; Lang v.
Hachman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246; Collisson X Kaplan
v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622.)
The
primary purpose of discovery sanctions is to obtain compliance with the Civil
Discovery Act and the Court’s orders. It is not to punish. (Newland v.
Super. Ct. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613; Ghanooni v. Super
Shuttle of Los Angeles (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) A discovery
sanction should not create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a
better position than it would have been if the opposing party had simply
complied with its obligations under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery
Act. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1164,
1194; see also 2 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure
Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023), ¶¶ 8:2214-2220.)
A
“terminating sanction issued solely because of a failure to pay a monetary
discovery sanction is never justified.” 
(Newland, supra, 40 Cal.App.4th at p. 615.) 
Discussion
The
Court must deny the motion for procedural reasons.
First, the initial motion, filed on
July 8, 2024, was initially set for hearing in
Department 31 on September 12 and was then reset by moving party for hearing in
Department 29 on October 9.  But there is
no proof of service or other evidence in the record showing that Defendant ever
gave notice to Plaintiff of the new hearing date, time, and location.
 
Second,
in the second motion, filed on September 11, 2024, the correct hearing date,
time, and location is included in the caption, but the body of the notice of
motion and motion lists the incorrect hearing location (Department 31, rather
than Department 29.)  A party must
strictly comply with the notice requirements for all motions, including
sanctions motions.
 
Third,
there is an issue with regard to the electronic service of the notice of ruling
(which underlies the request for further sanctions) as well as the electronic
service of the motion.  The complaint
identifies the email address for Plaintiff’s counsel as kelly@kingery-law.com. 
The notice of ruling, as well as the motion filed on September 11, 2024,
were served on kelly@kingery.law – close to, but not the same as, the
email address on the complaint.  The
Court cannot conclude that service to the latter email address is sufficient.
 
The
Court also notes that after this motion was filed, Plaintiff’s counsel filed a
change of address.  The notice identifies
the email address for electronic service on Plaintiff’s counsel as service@kingery.law.
 
Accordingly, the Court must deny the
motion without prejudice for procedural issues relating to service.
 
Finally,
the Court notes that although the denial is without prejudice, it is unclear
whether Defendant has presented sufficient evidence for terminating
sanctions.  For terminating sanctions, a party
must generally present evidence of repeated and willful misuse of the discovery
process, as well as evidence that less severe sanctions have not (or likely will not) lead to
compliance with the discovery rules.  It
is unclear whether there is a showing here of a history or pattern of willful abuse or
repeated violations that have not been (or cannot be) cured by lesser
sanctions.  And, of course, a discovery
sanction should not create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a
better position than it would have been if the opposing party had simply
complied with its obligations under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery
Act. (Rutledge, supra, 238 Cal.App.4th at p. 1194.)  
 
The motion is denied without
prejudice for procedural reasons.
 
Conclusion
The
Court DENIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE Defendant’s motion for terminating and other
sanctions.  
Moving Party is ordered to give notice.
