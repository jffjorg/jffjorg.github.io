And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel plaintiff Soheil Sahimi to respond to written discovery. The defendants, Leonard Scheiner and Leonard Joseph Scheiner, III, had filed three motions to compel plaintiff to respond to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production. The plaintiff failed to respond to the written discovery, and the defendants are seeking an order compelling the plaintiff to respond and seeking monetary sanctions.

The judge has granted the motions to compel, ordering the plaintiff to provide written, code-compliant, verified responses to the defendants' discovery requests within 15 days of notice. The judge has also denied the defendants' requests for sanctions, as the plaintiff did not oppose the motion to compel.

The judge's ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure, which provides that a party must respond to written discovery within 30 days of service, and that a party who fails to respond may be subject to a monetary sanction. The judge has applied these rules to the facts of the case, finding that the plaintiff failed to respond to the defendants' discovery requests and that the defendants are entitled to an order compelling the plaintiff to respond.
