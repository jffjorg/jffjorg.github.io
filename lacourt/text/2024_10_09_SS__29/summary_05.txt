And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment in the case of Jones v. Six Flags Magic Mountain. The plaintiffs, Walter E. Jones and Yahne Coleman, had filed a complaint against the defendant, Magic Mountain, LLC, alleging that they were violently attacked while attending a private party event at the amusement park on June 29, 2021. The plaintiffs asserted three causes of action: premises liability, negligence in hiring, retaining, supervising, and training, and negligent infliction of emotional distress.

The defendant argued that it had no duty to prevent third-party criminal assaults, that it did not breach any duty, and that any breach of duty was not a substantial factor in causing the assault and resulting harm to the plaintiffs. The judge found that the defendant had presented sufficient evidence to satisfy its initial burden of proof on summary judgment, showing that it had adequate and properly trained security personnel present at the event, including roving guards and Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputies.

The judge also found that the plaintiffs had not filed any opposition to the motion for summary judgment, and therefore had not met their burden of establishing that there were triable issues as to any breach of duty by the defendant. As a result, the judge granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment, ending the case without a trial.
