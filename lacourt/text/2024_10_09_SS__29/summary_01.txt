Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for a protective order in part and denied it in part. The deposition will be taken remotely, and both parties will be allowed to attend remotely. The plaintiff will also be allowed to send a representative to attend the deposition in person to monitor and observe the proceedings.

The judge has denied the defendant's request for sanctions, finding that the plaintiff acted with substantial justification in offering a reasonable compromise to avoid the need for the motion. However, the judge has granted the plaintiff's request for sanctions against the defendant and his counsel, ordering them to pay $1,250 in sanctions.

The judge has also set the terms for the deposition, requiring that the plaintiff provide a link for the deposition at least 24 hours in advance, and that the parties attend remotely. The judge has denied the defendant's request to exclude the plaintiff from attending the deposition in person, finding that the plaintiff has a right to attend depositions absent a showing of good cause.
