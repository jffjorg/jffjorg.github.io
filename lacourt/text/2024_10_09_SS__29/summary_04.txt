Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the motion to continue the trial date and reopen discovery in part. The motion was filed by the plaintiff, Molly Jean Sliwoski, who is seeking compensation for injuries she sustained when a bench collapsed at a hotel owned by the defendant, Extended Stay America. The plaintiff has been unable to complete some of the discovery necessary for the trial due to the relief of her previous counsel and the limited time available for discovery. The court finds that some of the discovery that the plaintiff has identified is highly relevant and will promote the purposes of pre-trial discovery.

The court also finds that the good cause has been shown to reopen discovery in part and to order a brief additional continuance of the trial. The continuance is necessary to allow the plaintiff to complete the discovery necessary for the trial, and the court concludes that the prejudice to the defendant from the continuance is moderate in degree.

The court grants the motion to continue the trial date to a date on or after January 17, 2025, and reopens fact discovery in part, limited to discovery directed to the medical professionals who treated the plaintiff. The court also reopens expert discovery and resets all discovery deadlines based on the new trial date. The court denies the motion to reopen other fact discovery.
