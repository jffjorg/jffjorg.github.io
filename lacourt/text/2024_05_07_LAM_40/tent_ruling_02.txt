 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Defendant
  LaserAway, LLC’s Motion to Compel Arbitration.



 
I. Background
A. Pleadings
Plaintiff Chelsea Eckland sues Defendants LaserAway LLC and Does 1 to 50
pursuant to a March 24, 2023 Complaint alleging claims of (1) Violation of
Labor Code § 1102.5, (2) Harassment, (4) Retaliation, (4) Failure to Prevent
Harassment, Discrimination, and/or Retaliation, (5) Failure to Pay Minimum or
Contractual Wages, (6) Failure to Provide Accurate Wage Statement, and (7)
Adverse Action in Violation of Public Policy.
The claims arise from allegations that during Plaintiff’s employment with
LaserAway—an aesthetic dermatology company offering cosmetic medical services
such as tattoo removal, hair removal, skin rejuvenation services, and skincare
products—LaserAway CEO, Scott Heckman, LaserAway Vice President of Human
Resources, Shannon Young, and other LaserAway employees engaged in conduct that
amount to violations of the Fair Employment and Housing Act, the Labor Code,
and public policy. That conduct included use of discriminatory and harassing
language—e.g., slurs related to black people and women—and retaliation against
Plaintiff based on her complaints of the constant and derogatory comments and
demeaning treatment of employees by Defendants’ management, involving the HR
Department in particular. The adverse actions alleged in the Complaint are
retaliation in the form of Plaintiff’s ostracization from company events and
socialization, LaserAway’s refusal to give Plaintiff an annual pay raise and
bonus that had been awarded to Plaintiff every year prior to 2022, and a
demotion in duties and position for Plaintiff.
B. First Motion to
Compel Arbitration
On September 19, 2023,
LaserAway filed a motion to compel arbitration of Plaintiff’s claims.
LaserAway’s motion primarily relied on a purported December 11, 2018, agreement
between the parties, with cursory reliance on a purported December 18, 2018,
agreement between the parties.
On November 7, 2023,
Plaintiff opposed LaserAway’s motion.
On November 14, 2023,
LaserAway replied to the opposition, for the first time raising an electronic
December 10, 2018, arbitration agreement between the parties.
On November 21, 2023,
the Court requested further briefing as to how the delegation clause in the
December 11, 2018, agreement to arbitrate affected a determination on
LaserAway’s motion.
On December 15, 2023,
LaserAway filed its supplemental briefing.
Later that day,
Plaintiff Eckland filed her supplemental briefing.
On January 2, 2024,
LaserAway’s motion came before the Court, at which time the Court heard oral
argument and took the matter under submission.
On January 8, 2024, the
Court ruled on LaserAway’s motion, denying relief as based on the December 11
and 18, 2018 agreements. The ruling noted that the Court would not consider
LaserAway’s reply arguments relating to the December 10, 2018, arbitration
agreement because that agreement was raised for the first time on reply.
C. Motion Before the
Court
On March 15, 2024,
LaserAway filed a second motion to compel arbitration of Plaintiff’s claims in
this action. LaserAway’s motion exclusively relies on the purported December
10, 2018, agreement between the parties.
On March 18, 2024,
LaserAway filed an errata notice relating to its evidence.
On April 24, 2024,
Plaintiff Eckland filed an opposition to LaserAway’s motion.
On April 30, 2024,
LaserAway filed a reply to Plaintiff Eckland’s opposition.
LaserAway’s second
motion to compel arbitration is now before the Court.
 
II. Requests for Judicial Notice
A. LaserAway’s Motion Request
for Judicial Notice
Per LaserAway’s request, the Court
takes judicial notice of the Complaint in this action and the JAMS Employment
Arbitration Rules. (Mot., RJN, pp. 2-3, Exs. A-B; see Evid. Code, §§ 452,
subds. (d), (h), 453, subds. (a)-(b).)
B. LaserAway’s Reply Request for
Judicial Notice
Per LaserAway’s request, the Court
takes judicial notice of LaserAway’s Answer in this action. (Reply, RJN, p. 2,
Ex. A; see Evid. Code, §§ 452, subd. (d), 453, subds. (a)-(b).)
 
III. Evidentiary Objections
A. LaserAway’s Reply Objections
to Opposition Evidence
Objection Nos. 1-6, 9 [¶¶ 3, 3-4,
5, 6, 8, 10, 13]: OVERRULED.
Objection Nos. 7-8 [¶¶ 11-12]:
SUSTAINED.
 
IV. Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay or Dismiss
Action: GRANTED.
A. Legal Standard
The Federal
Arbitration Act (“FAA”), while a federal statute, applies in California courts
and requires state courts to enforce arbitration agreements as required by the
federal common law developed under the FAA. (See Southland Corp. v. Keating
(1984) 465 U.S. 1, 15-16 (Southland Corp.); Broughton v. Cigna
Healthplans (1999) 21 Cal.4th 1066, 1074-78, superseded by statute on
another ground as stated in Ferguson v. Corinthian Colleges, Inc. (9th
Cir. 2013) 733 F.3d 928, 937.).) The FAA preempts and invalidates state law and
state judicial decisions that disfavor arbitration or require arbitration
provisions to pass higher scrutiny. (Southland Corp., supra, at
p. 12; Perry v. Thomas (1987) 482 U.S. 483, 490.) If the parties
designate the FAA applies, then California arbitration law is preempted. (See,
e.g., Rodriguez v. American Techs., Inc. (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 1110,
1121-1122.) However, courts have found that where the FAA is found not to
apply, the California Arbitration Act (Code Civ. Proc. § 1280 et seq.) applies.
(See Valencia v. Smyth (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 153, 178 (Valencia).)
 A
court’s inquiry is limited to a determination of (1) whether a valid
arbitration agreement exists and (2) whether the arbitration agreement covers
the dispute. (9 U.S.C. § 4; Chiron Corp. v. Ortho Diagnostics Systems, Inc.
(9th Cir. 2000) 207 F.3d 1126, 1130; Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc.
(2002) 537 U.S. 79, 84; see Simula, Inc. v. Autoliv, Inc. (9th Cir.
1999) 175 F.3d 716, 720 [if the finding is affirmative on both counts the FAA
requires the Court to enforce the arbitration agreement in accordance with its
terms]; see Omar v. Ralphs Grocery Co. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 955, 961
[In determining the enforceability of an arbitration agreement, the court first
considers “two ‘gateway issues’ of arbitrability: (1) whether there was an
agreement to arbitrate between the parties, and (2) whether the agreement
covered the dispute at issue”] Lacayo v. Cataline Restaurant Group Inc.
(2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 244, 257 (Lacayo) [Where moving party meets
initial burden, “the party opposing arbitration must prove by a preponderance
of the evidence any defense to the petition”].)
 Moreover,
the general rule is that the FAA governs all agreements to arbitrate in
contracts “involving interstate commerce.” (Higgins v. Superior Court
(2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1238, 1247.) The term “involving” commerce “is broad and
is indeed the functional equivalent of “affecting’ commerce.” (Allied-Bruce
Terminix Companies, Inc. v. Dobson (1995) 513 U.S. 265, 273-274.) The U.S.
Supreme Court has held that this broad interpretation includes employment
contracts. (See Circuit City Stores v. Adams (2001) 532 U.S. 105, 106.)
The defendant bears the burden of proving applicability of the FAA by showing
that its activities constitute interstate commerce. (Hoover v. Am. Income
Life Ins. Co. (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 1193, 1207.) Failure to demonstrate
that the employment agreement affects interstate commerce renders the FAA
inapplicable. (See Lane v. Francis Capital Management LLC (2014) 224
Cal.App.4th 676, 687-688 (Lane); Woolls v. Superior Court (2005)
127 Cal.App.4th 197, 212.)
Even
where the FAA governs the interpretation of arbitration clauses, California law
governs whether an arbitration agreement has been formed in the first instance.
(Baker v. Osborne Development Corp. (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 884,
893.) 

B. Analysis
1. Whether
Arbitration Agreement Exists
a. Relevant
Law
“Parties are not required to
arbitrate their disagreements unless they have agreed to do so. [Citation.] A
contract to arbitrate will not be inferred absent a ‘clear agreement.’
[Citation.] When determining whether a valid contract to arbitrate exists, we
apply ordinary state law principles that govern contract formation. [Citation]
In California, a ‘clear agreement’ to arbitrate may be either express or
implied in fact. [Citation.]” (Davis v. Nordstrom, Inc. (9th Cir. 2014)
755 F.3d 1089, 1092-93 [applying California law].)
b. Parties’
Arguments
In its motion, LaserAway contends
that Plaintiff electronically signed an arbitration agreement with LaserAway on
December 10, 2018, and that the electronic signature is properly verified.
(Mot., pp. 9-10, 15-17, citing Mot., Mault Decl., Ex. A.)
In opposition, Plaintiff challenges
the verification of the electronic signature attributed to Plaintiff Eckland on
the December 10, 2018, arbitration agreement. (Opp’n, pp. 10-11.)
In reply, LaserAway reiterates its
arguments from the moving papers while responding to the opposition. For
example, LaserAway argues that Plaintiff Eckland does not dispute that she
completed the electronic onboarding process, including electronically accepting
the arbitration agreement, instead simply arguing that she was not the only
person who could have had access to the December 10, 2018, arbitration
agreement. LaserAway argues that its evidence satisfies the relevant electronic
signature standard in California state courts.
c. Court’s
Determination
The Court finds in favor of
Defendant LaserAway on this issue.
The burden of persuasion is always
on the moving party to prove the existence of an arbitration agreement with the
opposing party by a preponderance of the evidence. (Gamboa v. Northeast
Community Clinic (2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 158, 164-165 (Gamboa), citations
omitted.) However, the burden of production may shift in a three-step process.
(Id. at p. 165.) First, the moving party bears the burden of producing
prima facie evidence of a written agreement to arbitrate the controversy, which
can be met by the moving party by attaching a copy of the arbitration agreement
purporting to bear the opposing party’s signature. (Ibid., citations
omitted.) If this burden is met, the burden shifts to the opposing party to
produce evidence to challenge the authenticity of the agreement, which can be
met by “testify[ing] under oath or declar[ing] under penalty of perjury that
the party never saw or does not remember seeing the agreement, or that the
party never signed or does not remember signing the agreement.” (Ibid.,
citations omitted.) If the opposing party meets its burden of producing
evidence, then in the third step, the moving party must establish with
admissible evidence a valid arbitration agreement between the parties. (Ibid.)
The burden of proving the agreement by a preponderance of the evidence remains
with the moving party. (Id. at pp. 165-166, citations omitted.)
Here, LaserAway meets its initial
burden of production by producing a copy of the December 10, 2018, arbitration
agreement, as purportedly electronically signed by Plaintiff Eckland using
LaserAway’s online portal, mylaseraway LMS (for ease of reference, the LMS
system). (Mot., Errata Notice, Napier Decl., ¶¶ 1-3, 5-6.)
In turn, Plaintiff Eckland meets
her responsive burden of production by providing a sworn declaration indicating
that she does not recall signing the December 10, 2018, arbitration agreement
during her onboarding process. (Oppn, Eckland Decl., ¶ 5.)
Thus, LaserAway must show by a
preponderance of the evidence that a valid arbitration agreement exists between
the parties. (Gamboa, supra, 72 Cal.App.5th at pp. 165-166.)
The primary dispute between the
parties is whether the electronic signature attributed to Plaintiff Eckland on
the December 10, 2018, arbitration agreement is properly verified. California
case law has held that an electronic signature was properly authenticated when
a declarant “detailed [the company’s] security precautions regarding
transmission and use of an applicant’s unique username and password, as well as
the steps an applicant would have to take to place his or her name on the
signature line of the employment agreement …,” such that “[b]ased on this
procedure, [the declarant] concluded that the ‘name [of the employee] could
have only been placed on the signature pages of the employment agreement … by
someone using [the employee’s] unique user name and password,’” and that “
[g]iven this process for signing documents and protecting the privacy of the
information with unique and private user names and passwords, the electronic
signature was made by [the employee] on the employment agreement … at the date,
time, and IP address listed on the documents.” (Espejo v. Southern
California Permanente Medical Group (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 1047, 1062 (Espejo).)
Here, the LaserAway security
precautions for signatures on LaserAway’s arbitration agreement are set out in
the declaration of Darrel Napier, Chief Technology Officer. The employee is
given a link to create a unique login ID and password, which is used to access
the arbitration agreement and sign the same on the LMS system. LaserAway’s
Chief Technology Officer is not authorized to use Plaintiff Eckland’s account
because access is limited to people who have the correct login ID and password.
(Mot., Errata Notice, Napier Decl., ¶ 3.) While the Eckland declaration
explains that she does not recall signing the December 10, 2018, arbitration
agreement, the Eckland declaration does describe Plaintiff’s use of the LMS
system. (Opp’n, Eckland Decl., ¶¶ 5-8 [detailing Plaintiff Eckland’s
multi-stage access of the LMS system].)
On balance, the Court is satisfied
that the evidence before the Court shows by the preponderance of the evidence
that LaserAway’s business records, as confirmed by its CTO, show that an
individual using Plaintiff Eckland’s unique login ID and password signed the
December 10, 2018, arbitration agreement on the LMS system. The Court notes
that it has sustained objections to the Eckland declaration where it makes
representations as to LaserAway’s access to Plaintiff Eckland’s LMS account or
LaserAway’s state of affairs, for which reason those arguments do not change
the Court’s determination. (Opp’n, Eckland Decl., ¶¶ 11-12; see Section III
discussion supra.)
2. FAA
Applies
The Court notes that the applicable
legal standards are those related to the Federal Arbitration Act, as provided
by the December 10, 2018, arbitration agreement. (Mot., Errata Notice, Napier
Decl., Ex. A.) The opposition does not challenge the interstate commerce
arguments in the moving papers, where interstate commerce is a necessary
component of FAA applicability. (See Mot., pp. 9, 13.) The Court is thus
satisfied that interstate commerce is at issue here.
3. Delegation
and Waiver
a. Relevant
Law
i. Delegation
Courts must defer “questions of
arbitrability” to the arbitrator where the parties have “clearly and
unmistakably” agreed that the arbitrator will decide those issues. (Howsam
v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. (2002) 537 U.S. 79, 84; Rent-A-Center,
West, Inc. v. Jackson (2010) 561 U.S. 63, 69-70; Aanderud v. Superior
Court (Vivint Solar Developer, LLC) (2017) 13 Cal.App.5th 880, 893 [clause
clearly and unmistakably referred issues of arbitrability to arbitrator and
clause incorporated JAMS Rules which provide for jurisdictional issues to be
determined by arbitrator]; Brennan v. Opus Bank (9th Cir. 2015) 796 F.3d
1125, 1132-1133 [incorporation of AAA rules into arbitration provision of
employment agreement constituted clear and unmistakable evidence of parties’ intent
to delegate questions of arbitrability, including whether clause was
unconscionable, to arbitrator].)
A broadly worded arbitration clause,
such as “all disputes arising from or related to this contract,” may show such
agreement. (Green Tree Fin’l Corp. v. Bazzle (2003) 539 U.S. 444,
451-452 [arbitrator to decide whether contract permitted classwide arbitration
where parties had agreed to arbitrate “[a]ll disputes, claims, or controversies
arising from or relating to this contract or the relationships which result
from this contract”]; but cf. Nelson v. Dual Diagnosis Treatment Ctr., Inc.
(2022) 77 Cal.App.5th 643, 656 [broad form arbitration clause (“all disputes
arising out of or related to”) alone insufficient to prove contractual intent
that issues of arbitrability shall be delegated to arbitrator].)
ii. Waiver
Under both state and federal law,
“no single test delineates the nature of the conduct that will constitute a
waiver of arbitration.” (Gloster v. Sonic Automotive, Inc. (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th
438, 447-448, internal quotations omitted.)
A party seeking to prove a waiver
may do so by showing “(1) knowledge of an existing right to compel arbitration;
(2) acts inconsistent with that existing right; and (3) prejudice to the party
opposing arbitration resulting from such inconsistent acts.” (Richards v.
Ernst & Young, LLP (9th Cir. 2013) 744 F.3d 1072, 1074 (internal quotes
omitted); Martin v. Yasuda (9th Cir. 2016) 829 F.3d 1118, 1124-1125; Guess?,
Inc. v. Superior Court (Kirkland) (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 553, 557.)
b. Parties’
Arguments
In its moving papers, LaserAway
argues that questions of arbitrability—including interpretation, applicability,
enforceability, or formation of the arbitration agreement—should be decided by
the arbitrator based on two grounds: (1) the language of the December 10, 2018,
arbitration agreement; and (2) the December 10, 2018, arbitration agreement’s
incorporation of the JAMS rules, which delegate threshold questions of
arbitrability to the arbitrator. (Mot., pp. 13-15.)
In opposition, Plaintiff Eckland
argues that LaserAway has waived any delegation in the December 10, 2018,
arbitration agreement by failing to raise the issue of delegation clauses in
the first motion to compel arbitration. Plaintiff Eckland also argues that there
is no clear and unmistakable agreement to delegate threshold arbitrability
questions because the December 10, 2018, arbitration agreement contains two
clauses permitting a court to make determinations relating to the agreement,
i.e., the representative actions, and the resolution of dispute sections. The
authority cited by Plaintiff appears to relate to California law as opposed to
the FAA.
In reply, LaserAway argues that it
has not waived the right to arbitrate. LaserAway also argues that the December
10, 2018, arbitration agreement’s reference to court determinations involves
determinations as to representative claims, whereas here Plaintiff brings
individual claims. LaserAway cites FAA authority holding that even where an
arbitration agreement does not apply to representative claims, a delegation
clause that relates to individual claims shows an unmistakable intent to
delegate.
c. Court’s
Determination
The Court finds in favor of
LaserAway.
To the extent that Plaintiff argues
that LaserAway’s motion is a renewed motion for consideration of the first
motion to compel arbitration, such an argument is not clear on the face of the
opposition papers.
As far as waiver, the Court
determines that no waiver occurred here. The essence of the opposition’s waiver
argument is that this motion was filed over 11 months after the Complaint was
filed and that the December 10, 2018, arbitration agreement could have been
raised in the first motion to compel arbitration. However, LaserAway’s
involvement in this action has been primarily focused on compelling arbitration
through a court order, and the failure to raise the December 10, 2018,
agreement in the first motion to compel arbitration does not appear dispositive
where fully fleshed-out briefing on the subject (see, e.g., § 1008) is not
before the Court. Plaintiff Eckland otherwise argues that LaserAway seeks to benefit
from both court and arbitration proceedings, where LaserAway only moves for
arbitration when Plaintiff seeks discovery, a delay tactic. However, these
representations, supported by Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration, are sparse on
detail as to how LaserAway has invoked the litigation machinery in this action
beyond arbitration issues. (Opp’n, Valdez Decl., ¶¶ 1-4 [detailing discovery
expectations but no procedural history].)
Moving to delegation, there are two
grounds to find a clear and unmistakable delegation to the arbitrator. First,
the plain language of the December 10, 2018, arbitration agreement reserves
certain questions for the arbitrator, including scope of the agreement
(interpretation, applicability) and defenses (enforceability). (Mot., Mault Decl.,
Ex. A, p. 4 [“The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any
dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or
formation of this Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all or
any part of this Agreement is void or voidable”].) Second, the December 10,
2018, arbitration agreement incorporates the JAMS rules, which delegate
threshold questions of arbitrability to the arbitrator. (Id., pp. 3-4
[December 10, 2018, arbitration agreement, JAMS rule incorporated]; Mot., p.
14, quoting Comprehensive Arbitrations Rules and Procedures (Jun. 1,
2021) JAMS <https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/>
Rule 11, subd. (b) [as of May 7, 2024] [“Jurisdictional and arbitrability
disputes, including disputes over the formation, existence, validity,
interpretation or scope of the agreement under which Arbitration is sought, and
who are proper Parties to the Arbitration, shall be submitted to and ruled on
by the Arbitrator. The Arbitrator has the authority to determine jurisdiction
and arbitrability issues as a preliminary matter.”].)
Thus, the Court determines that
questions of scope of the December 10, 2018, arbitration agreement, and
defenses to the enforcement of the December 10, 2018, arbitration agreement
must be referred to the arbitrator.
4. Disposition
LaserAway’s motion is GRANTED. 
V. Conclusion
Defendant LaserAway, LLC’s Motion
to Compel Arbitration is GRANTED.
The Court STAYS this action pending
the arbitrator’s determination of whether this action should properly proceed
in arbitration. If the arbitrator determines Plaintiff’s claims should be
litigated in arbitration, this action will be stayed until arbitration is had
in accordance with this or until such earlier time as the Court specifies. (9
U.S.C., § 3; Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.4.)
