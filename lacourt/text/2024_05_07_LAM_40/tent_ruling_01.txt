THE LAW FIRM OF FOX AND FOX, A GENERAL PARTNERSHIP COMPOSED OF
  FRANK O. FOX AND CLAIRE S. FOX, 
                        Plaintiff,
            v.
DAVID J. ITZIKMAN, an individual AND DOES 1 - 10, inclusive,
                        Defendants.


 Case No.:          20STCV30117
 Hearing Date:   5/7/24
 Trial Date:        N/A
 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Defendant David J.
  Itzikman’s Motion to Strike Plaintiff’s Costs Memorandum or, in the
  Alternative, to Tax Costs.



 
I. Background
A. Pleadings
On August 10, 2020,
Plaintiff The Law Firm of Fox and Fox (Fox & Fox) initiated this action by filing
a Complaint alleging claims of (1) Breach of Contract and (2) Common Counts
against Defendants David J. Itzikman and Does 1 through 10.
The claims arose from
allegations that Fox & Fox “represented Defendant [Itzikman] in the
dissolution of marriage matter, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, Case
Number BD 646 625. Defendant [Itzikman] owed the sum of $61,169.44, in fees and
costs, as of August 3, 2020.”
B. Default Judgment
and Set Aside
On October 14, 2020,
Fox & Fox filed a proof of service purporting to reflect personal service
of the summons and Complaint on Defendant Itzikman.
On December 8, 2020, based
on a failure to file a responsive pleading to the Complaint, Fox & Fox
secured an entry of default against Defendant Itzikman.
On December 15, 2020,
Fox & Fox requested default judgment.
On December 17, 2020,
Defendant Itzikman filed an Answer.
On February 7, 2021,
the Court granted default judgment.
On June 17, 2021, the
Clerk issued a writ of execution.
On June 28, 2021,
Defendant Itzikman filed a motion to set aside the default and default judgment
against him and to quash the writ of execution on the ground that the judgment
was void for lack of any service on Defendant Itzikman. Itzikman argued that service
had not been effected on him personally as reflected in the proof of service,
but rather, had been effected on a third person at Defendant Itzikman’s former
place of business in Los Angeles County, at a time when Defendant Itzikman was
physically present in San Diego County where his then-usual place of business
was located.
On July 8, 2021, Fox
& Fox filed an opposition to Defendant Itzikman’s motion to set aside.
On August 20, 2021, the
Court granted Defendant Itzikman’s motion to set aside the default and default
judgment and to quash the writ of execution.
The record fails to
reflect a proof of service for service of the summons and Complaint other than
the October 14, 2020, proof of service.
C. Motion to Deem
Truth of Admission Requests Admitted
On February 28, 2023,
Fox & Fox filed a motion to deem admitted the truth of matters in certain
requests for admission served on Defendant Itzikman. The motion also requested
sanctions.
On July 31, 2023, after
full briefing by both sets of parties, the Court denied Fox & Fox’s motion,
reasoning that Itzikman had served Code-compliant responses on July 13, 2023,
and that sanctions were not awardable where counsel was representing his own law
firm.
D. Motions in Limine
On September 8, 2023,
Fox & Fox filed a single motion in limine.
On September 19, 2023,
Defendant Itzikman filed an opposition to the motion in limine.
On September 25, 2023,
Fox & Fox filed a reply to the opposition.
The motion was denied at
the Final Status Conference on or around October 6, 2023.
E. Trial and
Judgment
In November 2023, a non-jury
trial was held in this action.
On January 11, 2024,
the Court posted a final statement of decision after trial, which found in
favor of Fox & Fox as to the Complaint’s two causes of action as against
Defendant Itzikman, for compensatory damages of $57,974.79.
That same day, the
Court entered judgment to this effect, and the Clerk gave notice of entry of
judgment.
F. Motion Before the
Court
On January 30, 2024, Fox
& Fox filed a memorandum of costs seeking $1,882.49 in costs.
On February 13, 2024,
Defendant Itzikman filed a motion to strike or tax costs from Fox & Fox’s
memorandum of costs.
On April 22, 2024, Fox
& Fox filed an opposition to Defendant Itzikman’s motion.
On April 29, 2024,
Defendant Itzikman replied to Fox & Fox’s opposition.
Defendant Itzikman’s
motion is now before the Court.
 
II. Motion to Strike or Tax Costs: GRANTED, in
part.
A. Timeliness
The Court briefly notes that while
the moving papers challenge the timeliness of the costs memorandum, the
opposition argues and the reply concedes that the memo was timely filed and served.
The Court therefore does not
further discuss this issue.
B. Legal Standard
In general, the “prevailing party”
is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs for suit in any action or
proceeding. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (b); Santisas v. Goodin
(1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 606; Scott Co. Of Calif. v. Blount, Inc. (1999)
20 Cal.4th 1103, 1108.) Assuming the “prevailing party” requirements are met,
the trial court has no discretion to order each party to bear his or her own
costs of suit. (Michell v. Olick (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1194, 1198; Nelson
v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 129.) The term “prevailing party”
for costs purposes is defined by statute to include:  
(1) The party with a net monetary
recovery;  
(2) A defendant who is dismissed
from the action;  
(3) A defendant where neither
plaintiff nor defendant recovers anything; and  
(4) A defendant as against those
plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against that defendant.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd.
(a)(4).)
 Allowable costs under Code of
Civil Procedure section 1033.5 must be reasonably necessary to the conduct of
the litigation, rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation,
and must be reasonable in amount. An item not specifically allowable under
Section 1033.5(a) nor prohibited under subdivision (b) may nevertheless be
recoverable in the discretion of the court if they meet the above requirements
(i.e., reasonably necessary and reasonable in amount). If the items appearing
in a cost bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking
to tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or necessary. (Ladas v.
California State Automotive Assoc. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 773-774 (Ladas).)
Moreover, a verified memorandum of costs is prima facie evidence that the
costs, expenses, and services therein listed were necessarily incurred. (Rappenecker
v. Sea-Land Serv., Inc. (1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 256, 266.) A party seeking to
tax costs must provide evidence to rebut this prima facie showing. (Jones v.
Dumrichob (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1258, 1266 (Jones), superseded by
statute on other grounds in Code Civ. Proc., § 998, subd. (c)(1) [whether costs
permissible from filing of complaint or from date of 998 offer].) Mere
statements unsupported by facts are insufficient to rebut the prima facie
showing that costs were necessarily incurred. (Jones, supra, at
p. 1266.) On the other hand, if the items are properly objected to, they
are put in issue and the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as
costs. (Ibid.)
Whether a cost item was reasonably
necessary to the litigation presents a question of fact for the trial court and
its decision is reviewed for abuse of discretion. (Ladas, supra, 19
Cal.App.4th at p. 774.) Because the right to costs is governed strictly by
statute, a court has no discretion to award costs not statutorily authorized. (Ibid.)
Discretion is abused only when, in its exercise, the court “exceeds the bounds
of reason, all of the circumstances being considered.” (Lincoln, supra,
39 Cal.App.4th at p. 105.) 
C. Analysis
1. Item
No. 7, Service of Process
a. Parties’
Arguments
Defendant Itzikman challenges
service of process costs of $710.12 as (1) excessive, (2) unreasonable beyond
$65 for initial service, (3) unreasonable in whole because service was never
effected on Itzikman, who filed an Answer before being served, with the proof
of service in the record being incorrect as to service on Itzikman, and (4)
unreasonable based on this Court ordering a vacatur of the default against
Itzikman, which was void for lack of proper service.
In opposition, Fox & Fox
provides an itemized list of costs amounting to a total of $1,012.85, all but
$133.12 of which relate to service of subpoenas on third parties and costs for
courier services to drop off documents with or pick up documents from the Court
between October 2023 and March 2024. The $133.12 in costs relate to the October
9, 2020, service of the summons and Complaint by purported personal service on
Defendant Itzikman.
In reply, Defendant Itzikman argues
that courier costs are not compensable. Defendant Itzikman further argues that
costs related to the October 9, 2020, service are not compensable where that
service was void insofar as personal service was never effected on Defendant
Itzikman himself—i.e., the basis for this Court’s set aside order.
b. Court’s
Determination
The Court determines that the
$133.12 in “service of process” costs were properly challenged by Defendant
Itzikman and are not compensable. While the October 14, 2020, proof of service
reflects personal service of the summons and Complaint on Defendant Itzikman,
this Court has found merit to the proposition that such personal service never
took place because service was effected on a third party at a former place of
business of Defendant Itzikman at a time when Itzikman was not present. (See 6/28/21
Motion; 8/20/21 Minutes.) 
The Court, however, finds that
costs related to service of third-party subpoenas and courier costs are
reasonable pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivisions
(a)(4), and (c)(4), i.e., “[i]tems not mentioned in … section [1033.5,
subdivision (a)] and items assessed upon application may be allowed or denied
in the court’s discretion.” Third party subpoenas are a valid method of
discovery, the use of which is important in civil litigation. The delivery or
pickup of documents with or from the Court is reasonably necessary to the
conduct of litigation. And here, Fox & Fox provide itemized receipts
showing that these costs were incurred. (Opp’n, pp. 6-7 at ¶¶ b.-i., citing
Opp’n, Exs. P-V, X.) Under these circumstances, the Court finds that these
costs are proper.
The Court thus GRANTS Defendant Itzikman’s
motion as to taxing “service of process” costs, in part, in the amount of
$133.12.
2. Item
No. 1, Filing and Motion Fees, [a] Motion to Continue Trial, [b] Motion in
Limine, and [c] Default Judgment
a. Parties’
Arguments
Defendant Itzikman challenges three
sets of filing and motion costs: (1) Fox and Fox’s costs related to a motion to
continue trial in this action; (2) Fox & Fox’s RFA’s motion and motion in
limine costs; and (3) Fox & Fox’s costs related to entry of default
judgment in this action. Defendant Itzikman argues that costs related to the
motion to continue trial should be denied where Defendant would have stipulated
to a trial continuance, that costs related to the admission requests motion and
the motion in limine should be denied where those motions were denied by this
Court, and that costs related to default judgment should be taxed based on lack
of proper service.
In opposition, Fox & Fox
provides an itemized list of filing and motion costs amounting to a total of
$655. Fox & Fox specifically argues that it asked for a stipulation to
continue trial and that Defendant Itzikman refused, leading to Fox & Fox’s motion
to continue trial.
In reply, Defendant Itzikman
reiterates arguments relating to these three points.
b. Court’s
Determination
The Court determines that costs
related to default and the writ of execution that followed are not recoverable
because they were premised on defective service, as discussed above. The Court
thus GRANTS Defendant Itzikman’s motion, in part, as to taxing “filing and
motion” costs in the amount of $259.32, comprised of the costs listed on pages four
to six of Fox & Fox’s opposition at paragraphs a. to e. and g.
However, the Court determines that the
other filing and service costs are proper. The trial continuance, admission
requests, and in limine motions were reasonably incurred in connection with
advancing this litigation. As for trial continuance, the record is conflicting
as to which party is “at fault” for the failure to stipulate to a trial
continuance, for which reason those costs were not properly put at issue. Exhibit
K, relating to an ex parte application in March 2023, is consistent with the request
for trial continuance made on March 20, 2023, pursuant to an ex parte by
Plaintiff which was opposed by Defendant.
As for the admission requests
motion, even if that motion was denied, it was only denied because Defendant
Itzikman filed late responses to the admission requests, thus mooting Fox &
Fox’s motion, with sanctions being denied as to Code of Civil Procedure
sections 2023 and 2033, not section 1032. As for the motion in limine, like
with the admission requests motion, Plaintiff fails to show that the motion was
not reasonable or necessary. The mere fact that the motion was denied alone is
not enough to meet this burden.
3. Item
No. 14, Fees for Electronic Filing or Service
a. Parties’
Arguments
Defendant Itzikman challenges the
$517.37 sought by Fox & Fox in electronic filing or service costs on the
ground that Fox & Fox has failed to provide any itemization of this cost
item or to explain how it was necessarily incurred.
In opposition, Fox & Fox
provides a list of the costs related to electronic filing or service, which
amount to total expenditures of $674.51.
In reply, Defendant Itzikman does
not directly address electronic filing costs.
b. Court’s
Determination
Defendant Itzikman’s motion has
merit in arguing that the electronic filing or service costs for default
judgment should not be awarded, i.e., costs in the amount of $12.17. (See
Opp’n, p. 8, at ¶¶ a.-b.)
However, the Court determines that
the remaining electronic filing and service costs—amounting to $652.17—are
supported by sufficient evidence to be allowed as costs pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 1033.5.
Consequently, the full $517.37 in electronic
filing or service costs sought by Plaintiff are reasonable.
4. Item
No. 14, Fees for Electronic Filing or Service
Pursuant to the above, the Court
TAXES the January 30, 2024, memorandum of costs in the amount of $392.44.
Fox & Fox is AWARDED $1,490.05
in costs. 
III. Conclusion
Defendant David J. Itzikman’s
Motion to Strike Plaintiff’s Costs Memorandum or, in the Alternative, to Tax
Costs is GRANTED, in part.
Plaintiff The Law Firm
of Fox and Fox’s January 30, 2023, memorandum of costs is TAXED in the amount
of $392.44.
Fox & Fox is AWARDED $1,490.05
in costs.
Plaintiff may submit a Proposed
Amended Judgment only adding in the costs awarded.
