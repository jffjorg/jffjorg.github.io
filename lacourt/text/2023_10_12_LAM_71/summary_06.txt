And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion of Joseph A. Maleki, Plaintiff's Counsel, to be relieved as counsel. The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and the motion should be granted if there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. The court finds that Counsel has submitted all necessary forms and has provided a declaration stating that Plaintiff did not voluntarily consent to Counsel's request to be relieved. The court orders that Counsel will be relieved upon filing proof of service on the client of the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel.
