CRC Violations
CRC, Rule 3.1350(d) provides: “When multiple causes of
action, issues or defenses are presented for summary adjudication in one
motion, each cause of action, issue or defense to which the motion is directed
must have a separate section heading indicating the issue number and specifying
the issue. The headings must be followed by two columns.”  (CRC,
Rule 3.1350(d); see CRC, Rule 3.1350(h)
[illustrating format for separate statements in a motion for summary judgment
and summary adjudication].)
Defendant’s separate statement is in violation of CRC,
Rule 3.1350(d) because it fails to identify each cause of action in
its separate statement for its motion in the alternative for summary
adjudication.  However, Defendant’s separate
statement comports with the requirements for summary judgment.  Therefore, the Court will consider
Defendant’s motion for summary judgment but not Defendant’s motion for summary
adjudication.
 
Procedural
Background
          Plaintiff
filed its initial complaint in this action on July 7, 2017, against Defendant.  On August 8, 2018, Hooman Nissani (“Hooman”)
and Ebrahim Nissani (“Ebrahim”) filed an initial complaint in LASC Case
No. BC717180 Hooman Nissani et al. vs. Broadway Federal
Bank FSB (“Nissani Action”). against Defendant.  On August 21, 2019, Hooman and Ebrahim filed
a first amended complaint in the Nissani Action.  On August 21, 2019, Plaintiff filed the
operative FAC in this case alleging five causes of action: (1) breach of
contract; (2) negligent misrepresentation; (3) breach of implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealing; (4) accounting; and (5) violation of Civil Code
§1785.1 et seq.  On July 21, 2023, this
Court granted parties’ stipulation for consolidations of cases, directing all
future documents to be filed in the instant case initiated by Slauson, BC667915.  On September 28,
2023, Ebrahim was dismissed as a Plaintiff from the instant action.
          Defendant
filed the instant motion on July 12, 2023. 
Plaintiff filed its opposition on September 28, 2023.  Defendant filed its reply on October 5, 2023.

 
          Motion
for Summary Judgment
Legal Standard
A
motion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the papers submitted show
that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving
party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.  (C.C.P. §437c(c).)
“Once
the defendant . . . has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . .
. to show that a triable issue of one or more material
facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.”  (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 849.)  “The plaintiff . . . may not rely upon the
mere allegations or denials of his ‘pleadings to show that a triable issue of
material fact exists but, instead, must ‘set forth the specific facts showing
that a triable issue of material fact exists as to that cause of action or a
defense thereto.”  (Id.)  “If plaintiff cannot do so, summary judgment
should be granted.”  (Avivi v. Centro
Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 463, 467.)
 
Breach of Contract (1st COA)
To allege a cause of action for breach of contract, Plaintiff
must plead the contract, plaintiff’s performance or excuse for non-performance,
defendant’s breach, and damage to plaintiff therefrom.  (Acoustics, Inc. v. Trepte Construction Co.
(1971) 14 Cal.App.3d 887, 913.)  Although
a written contract is usually pleaded by alleging its making and attaching a
copy which is incorporated by reference, a written contract can also be pleaded
by alleging the making and the substance of the relevant terms.  (Construction Protective Services, Inc. v.
TIG Specialty Insurance Co. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 189, 198-199; Perry v.
Robertson (1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 333, 341.)
Defendant submitted evidence that it did not breach the contract
with Plaintiff.  Specifically, Defendant
submitted evidence that at the time the Loan was paid off by Plaintiff, Plaintiff
had failed to make Monthly Payments under the Loan for the months of June and
July 2016, and the Loan was past due. 
(Defendant’s Disputed Separate Statement of Fact [“D-DSSF”] 28; Decl. of
Taylor ¶24(e), Exhs. 4, 5, 6, 7.) 
Defendant submitted evidence that it made numerous demands to both Plaintiff
and the Guarantors to cure the past due amounts in default but Plaintiff did
not cure these defaults until the payoff of the Loan.  (D-DSSF 28.). Defendant met its burden to
demonstrate it did not breach its contract with Plaintiff, shifting the burden
to Plaintiff to raise a triable issue of material fact.
Plaintiff met its burden to raise a triable issue of
material fact as to whether the contract was breached.  Specifically, Plaintiff submitted evidence of
Hooman’s declaration that Plaintiff made all required payments timely to
Plaintiff pursuant to the terms and conditions of the loan agreement dated
April 17, 2009.  (Plaintiff’s Disputed
Separate Statement of Fact [“P-DSSF”] 28; Decl. of Nissani ¶6.)
          Accordingly,
Defendant’s motion for summary judgment is denied. 
 
Conclusion
Defendant’s motion for summary
judgment is denied.
Defendant’s motion in the
alternative for summary adjudication is denied on the basis its separate
statement of fact is in violation of CRC, Rule 3.1350(d) and (h).
Moving Party to give notice.
