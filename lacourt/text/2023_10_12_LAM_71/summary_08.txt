And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Broadway Federal Bank, FSB's (currently known as City First Bank) motion for summary judgment, which sought to establish that there were no triable issues of material fact and that the bank was entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. The judge has also denied the bank's alternative motion for summary adjudication, citing a violation of California Rules of Court Rule 3.1350(d) and (h) in the bank's separate statement of fact.

The judge found that the bank had met its burden to demonstrate that it did not breach its contract with Plaintiff Slauson Gas Station, LLC, but that Plaintiff had raised a triable issue of material fact as to whether the contract was breached. The judge also noted that Plaintiff had submitted evidence that Hooman Nissani, a guarantor, had declared that Slauson Gas Station, LLC had made all required payments timely to the bank pursuant to the terms and conditions of the loan agreement.

The judge's ruling is tentative and will be subject to revision after further review of the parties' submissions.
