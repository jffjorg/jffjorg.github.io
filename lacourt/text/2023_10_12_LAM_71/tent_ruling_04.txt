 Hearing Date:  October 12, 2023



 
Defendants
Ratner Riverside Investment, LLC’s and Shaya Stauber’s petition to confirm the final
arbitration award is granted.  The Court
declines to award Defendants’ requested pre-award interest or post-judgment
interest.
 
          Defendants
Ratner Riverside Investment, LLC [erroneously sued as Ratner Riverside
Investment] (“Ratner”) and Shaya Stauber (“Stauber”) (collectively, “Defendants”)
request the Court confirm the final arbitration award in this matter and enter
a judgment confirming the award.  (Notice
of Motion, pg. 2; C.C.P. §§1285, 1286, 1287.4, 1290.2.)
 
Background
This case arises out of multiple commercial
tenancies concerning the real property located at 4001 W. Riverside Drive, Unit
E, Burbank, California 91505 and 171 N. Maple Drive, Unit A, Burbank,
California 91505.  (Complaint ¶1.)  Plaintiffs Metro Entertainment, Inc. (“Metro
Entertainment”) and Gold Star Hospitality, LLC (“Gold Star”) (collectively,
“Plaintiffs”) have been tenants at the respective subject properties.  (See Complaint ¶¶1, 9.)  
All matters were put before an arbitrator. The
Arbitration hearing occurred on April 7, 10, and 20, 2023, before Arbitrator Richard
E. Rico (Ret.).  (Motion, pg. 4; Decl. of
Partida ¶2, Exh. 1.)  On April 24, 2023, Judge
Rico issued an interim arbitration award in favor of Stauber and Ratner.  (Motion, pg. 4; Decl. of Partida ¶2, Exh.
1.)  
Defendants filed the instant motion on August
10, 2023.  Plaintiffs filed their
opposition on September 29, 2023.  Defendants
filed their reply on October 4, 2023. 
Defendants argue in their reply that Plaintiffs’ opposition is untimely
per C.C.P. §190.6., and Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. v. Bernard
(2010) 106 Cal.App.4th 60, 64.  The
Court, in its discretion, considers Plaintiff’s opposition.
 
Arbitration Award
C.C.P. §1285 provides that a party to arbitration may
petition the court to confirm an arbitration award.  C.C.P. §1286 provides: “If a petition or
response under this chapter is duly served and filed, the court shall confirm
the [arbitration] award as made . . . unless in accordance with this chapter it
corrects the award and confirms it as corrected, vacates the award or dismisses
the proceeding.”
Absent a timely filed petition to correct or vacate the
award, the court must render a judgment confirming the arbitrator’s award.  (Weinberg v. Safeco Insurance Co.
(2004) 114 Cal.App.4th 1075, 1083-1084; Valsan Partners Limited v. Calcor
Space Facility, Inc. (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 809, 818.)
The specific grounds upon which an arbitrator’s award may
be vacated are set forth in C.C.P. §1286.2.  Except for such grounds, arbitration awards
are immune from judicial review.  (See
Moncharsh v. Heily & Blase (1992) 3 Cal.4th 1, 10-11 [limiting grounds for
judicial review effectuates the parties’ agreement that the award be final and
also reflects that arbitrators need not follow the law and may base their
decisions on “broad principles of justice and equity . . . paths neither marked
nor traceable by judicial review”].)  Generally,
errors of law committed by the arbitrator are not grounds for challenging the
arbitration award.  (Id. at pg.
11.)  The sufficiency of evidence of the
evidence to support the award is immaterial and courts cannot review the same.  (See Morris v. Zuckerman (1968) 69
Cal.2d. 686, 691.)  Courts cannot pass
upon the validity of the arbitrator’s reasoning and cannot substitute its
judgment for that of the arbitrator.  (See
Moncharsh, 3 Cal.4th at pg. 11.)
          Defendants
argue Stauber is entitled to pre-award interest on the sum of $44,890.33 from
the date of the final arbitration award through the date of entry of judgment
at a rate of ten percent per annum, pursuant to Civil Code §3289 and California
Constitution art. XV, §1, for a total of $748.17.  (Motion, pg. 6.)  Defendants argue Ratner is entitled to a
pre-award interest on the sum of $30,338.68, for a total of $505.64.  (Motion, pg. 6.).  Defendants argue they are also entitled to
post-judgment interest at a rate of ten percent per annum on all uncollected
amounts pursuant to C.C.P. §685.010, and to reasonable attorneys’ fees and
other costs expended by Stauber and Ratner’s counsel in their efforts to
enforce this Judgment, pursuant to C.C.P. §685.040, subject to proof.
On April 24, 2023, Arbitrator Hon. Judge Richard Rico
(ret.) issued the following award in this matter: “Ratner is liable for the
damage claimed by Metro of $2,700.”  (Decl.
of Partida, Exh. 1 at pg. 8.)  On June
30, 2023, Judge Rico awarded attorney’s fees as follows: “Respondents are
entitled to judgment in their favor as follows: Against Gold Star for
$44,940.82; Against Metro for $30,343.17.” 
(Decl. of Partida, Exh. 2 at pg. 6.) 
The amount of attorney’s fees awarded to Ratner against Metro
Entertainment included a reduction for the award of $2,700.00 in damages
awarded to Metro Entertainment.  (Decl.
of Partida, Exh. 2 at pg. 6.)  No
judgment exists and Judge Rico did not award any other damages. Therefore, any
award of “post-award interest” is inappropriate and unsupported by law.
Accordingly, Defendants’ motion is to confirm the
arbitration award against Gold Star for $44,940.82, and against Metro
Entertainment for $30,343.17 is granted. 
The Court declines to award Defendants’ requested pre-award interest or
post-judgment interest.
 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, Defendants’ motion is to confirm
the arbitration award against Gold Star for $44,940.82, and against Metro
Entertainment for $30,343.17 is granted. 
The Court declines to award Defendants’ requested pre-award interest or
post-judgment interest.
Moving Party to give notice.
