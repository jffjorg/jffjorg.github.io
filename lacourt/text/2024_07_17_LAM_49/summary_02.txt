Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Cogenics Consulting Group's motion to transfer the venue from Los Angeles County to Alameda County. The judge found that Plaintiff Aids Healthcare Foundation has demonstrated that the contract for the implementation and installation of the software was to be performed at Plaintiff's headquarters in Los Angeles, and therefore, the venue is proper in Los Angeles County. The judge also found that Defendant has failed to meet its burden to demonstrate that the venue is not proper under any of the statutory grounds.

The judge has also denied Defendant Planful's joinder to the motion to transfer venue, as Defendant Planful's joinder was untimely and ineffective.

The judge has struck the Substitution of Attorney filed by Defendant Cogenics Consulting Group, as it was improper and did not comply with California law.

The judge has declined to award attorney's fees to either party, finding that both parties acted with substantial justification.

The judge has scheduled a hearing on the tentative ruling for July 17, 2024, and has invited any interested parties to submit on the tentative ruling by email.
