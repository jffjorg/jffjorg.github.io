And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's request for punitive damages. The plaintiff, Saul Olmos, alleges that he was injured while working for the defendant, Home Express Delivery Service, and was terminated during his medical leave. The plaintiff claims that the defendant's conduct was malicious and oppressive, but the judge finds that he has failed to allege sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages. The judge also finds that the plaintiff has not alleged specific facts of fraud, oppression, or malice perpetrated by an officer, director, or managing agent of the defendant. Therefore, the motion to strike is granted without leave to amend. The judge orders the defendant to file an answer to the First Amended Complaint, as modified by this ruling, within 21 days.
