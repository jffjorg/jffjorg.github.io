The Judge's tentative ruling is that the two cases, Lim v. 977 S. Westmoreland Ave Apartments and Lee v. Lim, are ordered related. The cases arise from the same nucleus of facts, involving the same parties and landlord-tenant relationship. The Plaintiff, Soowan Lee, filed a notice of related case indicating that the two cases are related. The Judge found that the cases meet the requirements under California Rule of Court 3.300, including involving the same parties, arising from the same or substantially identical transactions, and requiring the determination of the same or substantially identical questions of law or fact. The Judge also noted that the cases involve overlapping parties and the same landlord tenant relationship during the same time period. Therefore, the Judge ordered the cases to be related and assigned to Department 58.
