Procedural Requirements 
 
            If all the
related cases have been filed in one superior court, as it is here, “[w]here
the cases listed in the notice are unlimited civil cases, the judge who has the
earliest filed case must determine whether the cases should be ordered related
and assigned to his or her department.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.300(h)(1)(A).) 
 
As 18STUD04768 is the earliest case
having been filed in 2018; however, Department 58 shall determine whether the
cases are related because the earlier case is an unlawful detainer case in a
limited department. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.300(h)(1)(B).)
 
            The notice
of related case must be filed in all pending cases listed in the notice and
must be served on all parties in those cases. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.300(d).) No notice of related cases was filed in the18STUD04768 action,
although this case was resolved by stipulated judgment in 2018 and is thus, not
pending. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.300(d).)
 
            A party may
respond to a notice of related cases within five days of service on the
party. (Cal. Rule of Court 3.300(g).) No objections were
filed to the notice of related cases.  
 
            The notices of related cases are
procedurally proper. 
 
Substantive Requirements 
 
            The inquiry
on a notice of related cases is whether the cases at issue (1) involve the same
parties and are based on the same or similar claims; (2) arise from the same or
substantially identical transactions, incidents, or events requiring the
determination of the same or substantially identical questions of law or fact;
(3) involve claims against, title to, possession of, or damages to the same
property; or (4) are likely for other reasons to require substantial
duplication of judicial resources if heard by different judges. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.300(a)(1)-(4).) 
 
            The
cases arise from the same nucleus of facts. Here, the Complaints contain overlapping
legal issues that are based on the same nucleolus of facts arising from the
parties’ landlord tenant relationship. 
            
            In the 18STUD04768 action, Plaintiff
Soowan Lee brings this unlawful detainer action for the real property located
at 977 S. Westmoreland Ave, Apt. 7, Los Angeles, 90006. Plaintiff seeks damages
in amount less than $10,000. 
 
            In 20STCV13441, Plaintiffs Chang
Lim, Justin Lim, and Sean Lim filed a Complaint against Defendants 977
Westmoreland Ave Apartments and Soowan Lee. The Complaint contains claims for
various habitability issues arising from Plaintiffs’ tenancy at 977 S.
Westmoreland Ave, Apt. 7, Los Angeles, 90006
 
The
cases involve overlapping parties and the same landlord tenant relationship
during the same time period. Therefore, the Court finds the cases are related
under California Rule of Court 3.300, subd. (a).  
 
            Defendant Soowan Lee to
give notice.
