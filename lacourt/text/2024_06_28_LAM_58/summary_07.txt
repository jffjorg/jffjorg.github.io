And here is the English text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is based on the Plaintiff's objection to the Defendants' request for judicial notice, neither exhibit was admitted in the arbitration proceeding. The Judge notes that issue preclusion or collateral estoppel applies only to issues that were actually litigated and decided in the first action, not to issues that could have been but were not decided. However, at the demurrer stage, the Judge cannot conclude that the entire Complaint is barred. The Complaint and the Statement of Claims in the Arbitration involve the same adverse employment action - the Plaintiff's constructive termination - which resulted in loss of earnings and employment benefits. However, the Plaintiff also claims to have suffered humiliation, emotional distress, and mental pain and anguish, which may not be the same injuries as those claimed in the harassment based on specific, distinct conduct. The Judge references the case of Skrbina, which analyzed causes of action for a motion for summary judgment, and applies the same "primary rights" analysis here for res judicata purposes.
