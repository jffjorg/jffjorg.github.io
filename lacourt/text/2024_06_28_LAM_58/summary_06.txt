And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the demurrer to the complaint is overruled. The defendants argued that the new complaint is barred by res judicata, as the same claims were already adjudicated in a previous arbitration proceeding. However, the judge found that the two proceedings involve different causes of action, as the claims in the new complaint arise from different facts and circumstances than the previous arbitration proceeding. Specifically, the claims in the new complaint relate to disability discrimination and harassment, whereas the previous arbitration proceeding related to sex discrimination and harassment. The judge concluded that the demurrer fails because the defendants have not satisfied the first element of res judicata, which requires that the same causes of action are involved in both proceedings.
