[1]           Based on Plaintiff’s
objection to Defendants’ request for judicial notice, neither exhibit was
admitted in the arbitration proceeding. 


[2]           In contrast, issue preclusion
or collateral estoppel applies only to issues that were actually litigated and
decided in the first action (Mata v. City of
Los Angeles (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 141, 148-149), not
to issues that could have been but were not decided.


[3]           While there is appears to
be apparent overlap on the injury sustained, the Court cannot conclude at the
demurrer stage that the entire Complaint is barred. For example, both the
Complaint here and the Statement of Claims in the Arbitration involve same
adverse employment action – Plaintiff’s constructive termination – which
presumably resulted in “loss of earnings and employment benefits”. (Compl., ¶
26 [Plaintiff had no choice but to resign on or around April 15, 2021]; Def.’s
RJN Ex. C [Statement of Claims, ¶ 23].) However, Plaintiff also states she
“suffered humiliation, emotional distress, and mental pain and anguish”; it is
not clear that these are the same injuries where there are claims for
harassment based on specific, distinct conduct.
 [4]           Although this
discussion in Skrbina occurred in the context of determining
causes of action for a motion for summary judgment, the analysis applies here
for res judicata purposes because the court had to determine causes of action
using the same “primary rights” analysis.
