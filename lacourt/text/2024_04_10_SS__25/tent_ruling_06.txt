BACKGROUND
 
On
December 16, 2022, Anastacio To Vasquez (“Plaintiff”), filed two causes of action
for negligence and negligence per se against Defendant Zhanarbek Sapakov (“Defendant”).
 
Defendant

On

Verified Responses to Defendant’s Interrogatories, Set One; Compel Plaintiff’s
Verified Responses to Defendant’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set
One; and Requests for Monetary Sanctions against Plaintiff in the Amount of

MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
            Defendant
prays for an order from the Court compelling Plaintiff to respond, without
objection, to Defendant’s Request for Production (“RFPs”) and Form
Interrogatories which was served on Plaintiff on September 05, 2023. Defendant
makes this motion on the grounds that Plaintiff has failed to serve timely
responses to the above-described request for production of documents and form
interrogatories. Defendant additionally prays for $661.65 in monetary sanctions
to be issued against Plaintiff for each motion based on 3 hours of attorney
time spent at a rate of $200.00 per hour plus $61.65 in filing fees.
 
OPPOSITION
 
             No opposition has been filed. 
 
REPLY
 
             No reply has been filed.
 
ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal Standard  
A party must respond to
interrogatories and requests for production of documents within 30 days after
service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subd. (a).) If a party to whom interrogatories or requests for production of
documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the requesting party
may move for an order compelling responses to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).) The party also
waives the right to make any objections, including one based on privilege or
work-product protection. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a); Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel
responses to interrogatories or production of documents other than the cut-off
on hearing discovery motions 15 days before trial. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2024.020, subd. (a), 2030.290; Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) No meet and confer
efforts are required before filing a motion to compel responses to the
discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290; Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) 
 
II.        Discussion
A.
Motion to Compel Responses to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories and RFPs
 
As
a preliminary matter, the Court notes that Defendant files two motions seeking
to compel responses to his RFPs and Form Interrogatories from the Plaintiff.
Since Defendant has paid the filing fees for both motions, argues the same facts,
and has provided Plaintiff with proper notice, the Court’s order will address
the merits of both motions below. 
 
Defendant
provides the declaration of his counsel who stated that on June 02, 2023, Defendant
served both his Form Interrogatories and RFPs on Plaintiff’s counsel. (Arnold
J. Alban Decl. ¶ 2; Exh. A.) Responses to Defendant’s discovery request were
due by July 05, 2023. Counsel declares that on June 20, 2023, Plaintiff’s
counsel emailed him to inform counsel that their office no longer represented Plaintiff.
(Id.) Plaintiff became self-represented on April 14, 2023. (Id.) On
September 05, 2023, Defendant served both his Form Interrogatories and RFPs on Plaintiff.
(Id. ¶ 3; Exh. B.) Responses were due on October 09, 2023. (Id.)
Counsel avers that Plaintiff’s responses have not been forthcoming despite counsel’s
inquiry on the status of the discovery responses on November 16, 2023. (Id.)
Counsel avers that no responses to Defendant’s discovery request have been received
nor has an extension been requested. (Id.)
 
Here,
the Court finds that more than 30 days have lapsed since Defendant served his
discovery requests on Plaintiff. Defendant
has provided evidence indicating that Plaintiff has not provided responses to
both of Defendant’s discovery requests and that no extension has either been
sought or given. Thus, since more than thirty (30) days have lapsed
since Defendant served both his RFPs and Form Interrogatories, and no responses
have been received, Defendant is therefore entitled to pursue the instant
motion.  
 
Accordingly, the
Court GRANTS Defendant’s Motion to: Compel Plaintiff’s Verified
Responses to Defendant’s Interrogatories, Set One and Compel Plaintiff’s
Verified Responses to Defendant’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set One.
 
B.
Sanctions
 
Code of Civil Procedure § 2023.030(a)
provides, in pertinent part, that the court may impose a monetary sanction on a
party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process to pay the reasonable
expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone because of that
conduct.  Misuse of discovery includes “failing to respond or submit to an
authorized method of discovery.”  (Code Civ. Proc. §¿2023.010(d)). 
 
The Court finds Plaintiff’s failure
to respond to Defendant’s discovery requests, a misuse of the discovery
process. Defendant has successfully argued the motion and without evidence to
the contrary, the Court cannot find that Plaintiff acted with substantial
justification in failing to respond to Defendant’s discovery requests. Thus, the
Court must impose monetary sanctions on Plaintiff for his failure to respond to
the discovery requests that necessitated the instant motions. 
 
Plaintiff
seeks $661.65 in monetary sanctions to be issued against the Plaintiff, for each
motion, for the sum of $61.65 in court costs, one (1) hour in time spent
drafting the motion at a rate of $200.00 per hour, plus two (2) hours in reviewing
opposition papers, preparing a reply, and appearance fees. (Alban Decl. ¶ 6.) The Court does not find the
amount to be reasonable given the simplicity and similarities of the Motions
and the lack of opposition and reply. Accordingly, the Court grants sanctions
in the amount $523.30 total for both motions for: two (2) hours combined for
time spent drafting the motion and for the appearance at a rate of $200.00 per
hour, plus $123.30 in court fees.
