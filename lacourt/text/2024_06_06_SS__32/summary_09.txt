And here is the English-text summary:

The court's tentative ruling is regarding the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Alivia Abreu, counsel for Karla Cecibeth Cruz, the plaintiff. The motion is based on a breakdown in communication between Counsel and the Plaintiff. The court finds that this is a valid reason for withdrawal. However, Counsel has not included all necessary information in the proposed order, such as dates, times, and locations of future proceedings. The court orders Counsel to file an amended proposed order within 5 calendar days of the hearing and serves the signed order within 10 days of the date of the order. The court conditionally grants the motion pending Counsel's compliance with these requirements.
