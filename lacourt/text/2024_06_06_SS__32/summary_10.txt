The tentative ruling denies the motions to compel further responses to special interrogatories and requests for production of documents, set one, brought by plaintiffs Shannon Tymkiw and Bradley Wheeler against defendant Sarah Coplen. The court finds that the plaintiffs failed to schedule an informal discovery conference (IDC) and did not respond to the defendant's arguments regarding amended responses and lack of sufficient meet and confer efforts. The court also notes that the plaintiffs failed to provide notice of the court's orders and file a proof of service.
