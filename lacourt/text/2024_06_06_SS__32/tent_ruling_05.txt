RULING
 



DEPT:


32




HEARING DATE:


June
  6, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


21STCV25360




MOTIONS:  


(1)
  Motion for Order Deeming Admitted Truth of Facts
(2)
  Motion to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set Two




MOVING PARTY:


Defendant Alice Chan




OPPOSING PARTY:


Unopposed 



 
BACKGROUND
 
 Defendant Alice Chan (“Defendant”) now moves
for an order to deem admitted Requests for Admission, Set Two and to compel verified
responses to Special Interrogatories, Set Two,
propounded on Plaintiff Marquise Gaines (“Plaintiff”). No opposition has been
filed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Requests
for Admission
 
Where there has
been no timely response to a request for admission under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction.¿ (Code of Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)¿ The party who failed to respond waives any
objections to the demand, unless the court grants that party relief from the
waiver, upon a showing that the party (1) has subsequently served a
substantially compliant response, and (2) that the party’s failure to respond
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.¿ (Code of Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subds. (a)(1)-(2).)¿ The court “shall” grant a motion to
deem admitted requests for admissions, “unless it finds that the party to whom
the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on
the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in
substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”¿ (Code of Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subd. (c).)¿ 
 
Where a party
fails to provide a timely response to requests for admission, “[i]t is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”¿
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
 
Interrogatories
 
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to
serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
responses. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290 (b).) Failure to timely respond waives
all objections, including privilege and work product, unless “[t]he party has
subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance” and “[t]he
party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290 (a)(1),
(a)(2).) The statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel where no
responses have been served and no meet and confer is required when a party does
not respond to discovery requests. All that need be shown in the moving papers
is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the opposing party,
that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been
served. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902,
905-906.)  
 
If a motion to
compel responses is filed, the Court shall impose a monetary sanction against
the losing party “unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290 (c).) Further, “[t]he
court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files
a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was
filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery
was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1348(a). 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Here, Defendant asserts that she served Requests for
Admission, Set Two and Special Interrogatories, Set Two on Plaintiff on December
27, 2023. (Chen Decl. ¶ 2, Exh. A.) The responses were due on January 30, 2024.
(Id. ¶ 3.) Plaintiff has not responded and has not filed an opposition to this
motion. Therefore, the motion to deem admitted and motion to compel are
granted.   
 
Although
Defendant has not requested monetary sanctions, sanctions are mandatory for the
motion to deem admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(c).) Therefore, the Court
awards $60 in monetary sanctions against Plaintiff for the filing fee. 
 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s Motion to deem Request for
Admissions, Set Two admitted is GRANTED. Defendant’s Motion to Compel Special
Interrogatories, Set Two is GRANTED. Plaintiff Marquise Gaines shall serve verified responses without objections within 10
days. 
 
The Court grants monetary sanctions against Plaintiff in
the amount of $60.00. Said
monetary sanctions are to be paid to counsel for Defendant within 30 days of
the date of this order. 
 
Defendant shall
provide notice of the Court’s order and file a proof of service of such.
