And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court grants in part the motion to continue trial. The Court finds good cause to continue trial, as the Defendant has filed a summary judgment motion and the Plaintiff does not oppose a continuance. The final status conference is continued to July 14, 2025, and the new trial date is set for July 28, 2025. The Court also grants the motion to continue trial, with all discovery and pre-trial motion cut-off dates to be in accordance with the new trial date.
