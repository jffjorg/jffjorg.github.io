And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court will hold a hearing to discuss the status of discovery in the case between Nandini Mehta and Netflix, Inc. and David B. McLean. The case involves an employment action filed by Mehta against the defendants, and the court has previously denied her motion to compel the production of unredacted documents. The court has also stated that if Mehta indicates a desire to pursue a motion to compel further, the court will appoint a discovery referee to determine the defendants' claim of privilege as to certain documents. The defendants have indicated that they reached an agreement with Mehta's counsel on the selection of a discovery referee, but have not yet submitted a proposed order to the court. Mehta's counsel was relieved on July 23, 2024, and Mehta is now self-represented. The court will hear from the parties regarding the issues before making a final ruling.
