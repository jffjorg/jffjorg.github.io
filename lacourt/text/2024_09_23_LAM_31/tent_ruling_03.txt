MOTIONS
TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL



 
MOVING PARTY:               Leslie
Ann Boyce, Law Offices of Leslie Ann Boyce
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
 
On September 3, 2024, Leslie Ann Boyce, counsel for Defendants
and Cross-Complainants, Azealia Banks and Lasagna Girl, LLC, filed these Motions
to be Relieved as Counsel.  The hearings
were scheduled for October 15, 2024 and October 16, 2024.
 
On September 10, 2024, Ms. Boyce filed an ex parte
application to shorten time for the hearing of the motions to be relieved.  On September 11, 2024, the ex parte
application was granted.  The hearings
were advanced and rescheduled to September 23, 2024.
 
The motions are unopposed.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARDS 
 
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and motion to be directed to
the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general terms and without
compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a
motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of
filing a consent under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the Declaration
in Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-052));
(3) service of the notice of motion and motion and declaration on all other
parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order relieving
counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as
Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). 
 
The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw,
and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the
client, and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice.  (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  
 
III.       DISCUSSION 
 
Leslie Ann Boyce seeks to be relieved as counsel of record
for Defendants/Cross-Complainants for the following reasons: “Upon discharging
counsel, client failed to execute and return substitution forms prepared by
counsel; subsequently client has failed to communicate with counsel.”  Additionally, “Irreconcilable differences
have arisen between the client and the attorney, making it unreasonably
difficult to carry out the employment effectively.”  (Forms MC-052.)   
 
Absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s
request for withdrawal should be granted.  (People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d
398, 406.)
 
Upon review, the court finds the Motions comply with California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  
 
IV.       CONCLUSION         
            The
unopposed Motions are granted and effective upon the filing of the proof of
service of this signed order upon Defendants/Cross-Complainants. 
            Counsel to
give notice.
