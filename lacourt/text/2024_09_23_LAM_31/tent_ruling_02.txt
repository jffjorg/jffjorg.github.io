HEARING
RE: DISCOVERY REFEREE
 
STATUS
CONFERENCE RE: PLAINTIFF’S NEW COUNSEL



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
Nandini Mehta
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendants Netflix,
Inc. and David B. McLean
 
 
On July 13, 2021, Plaintiff Nandini Mehta filed this
employment action against Defendants, Netflix, Inc. (“Netflix”), and David B.
McLean (“McLean”), arising from her alleged wrongful termination from
employment with Netflix.  
 
On October 21, 2023, in
response to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set Two,
Defendants made a supplemental production of documents which were redacted in
part or in whole, on the basis of privilege.  Pursuant to Plaintiff’s
request, on December 8, 2023, Defendants served a privilege log.  The
privilege log identified 199 different documents. Plaintiff further requested
Defendants to produce unredacted copies of the at-issue documents. Defendants
refused as to 198 of the documents.  Meet and confer efforts did not
resolve the dispute.  
 
            On February
5, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Compel Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
§ 2031.285(d)(1).  Plaintiff sought an order compelling Defendants to
produce unredacted copies of the 198 documents from Defendants’ supplemental
production.  On May 7, 2024, the court
denied Plaintiff’s motion without prejudice. 
The court also stated: “If Plaintiff indicates the desire to pursue a
motion to compel further, the court, on its own motion, will appoint a
discovery referee for the limited purpose of determining the Defendants’ claim
of privilege as to the 198 documents.”
 
            On May 9,
2024, Plaintiff filed this Motion to Compel Further Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure § 2031.310.  Plaintiff seeks to
compel defendants to produce unredacted copies of all (198) documents included
in Defendants’ privilege log.
 
            On May 22,
2024, Defendants filed a Status Report Regarding Discovery Referee indicating
that the parties reached agreement on a discovery referee and would be
submitting a proposed order with their selection shortly.  However, to date, the proposed order has not
been submitted to the court. 
 
            On July 23,
2024, Plaintiff’s counsel was relieved as counsel.  Plaintiff is currently self-represented.
 
It is not clear whether Plaintiff is still seeking
production of the unredacted documents or whether the appointment of a
discovery referee is still necessary.  
 
The court
will hear from the parties regarding the foregoing issues.
