And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion filed by Plaintiff Liza Porras to compel Defendant Ralphs Grocery Company to provide a verified response to Special Interrogatory No. 35 without objection. The judge found that Defendant's objections to the special interrogatory did not need to be verified and were complete and timely when served. The judge also noted that the motion did not comply with the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 and California Rules of Court section 3.1345. The judge denied the motion and declined to award sanctions to the plaintiff.
