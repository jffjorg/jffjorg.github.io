And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant to provide a verified response to Special Interrogatory No.35 without objection. The plaintiff had requested an order compelling the defendant to provide a verified response and sanctions in the amount of $2,861.65. The judge found that the defendant's objections to the special interrogatory did not need to be verified and were timely when served. The judge also noted that the plaintiff's contention that the defendant waived its objections by failing to serve a timely response was without merit. Additionally, the judge found that the plaintiff's motion did not require a separate statement, as the defendant had served a timely response consisting solely of objections.
