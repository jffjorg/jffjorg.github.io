And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a hearing scheduled for October 25, 2023, regarding Plaintiff Royal United Group, LLC's request for entry of default judgment. The Plaintiff filed a complaint on November 29, 2022, against various defendants, including The Testate and Intestate Successors of Ernest Brown, The Testate and Intestate Successors of Erline Brown, and All Persons Unknown Claiming Any Legal or Equitable Right, Title, Estate, Lien, or Interest in the Property Described in the Complaint Adverse to the Plaintiff's Title, or Any Cloud on Plaintiff's Title Thereto.

The Court previously issued Orders for Publication regarding the various defendants and entered default on August 28, 2023. The Plaintiff then filed various documents, including requests for court judgment and dismissal, amended request for judicial notice, brief case summary, declarations, exhibits, witness list, and proposed judgment. On October 18, 2023, the Clerk's Office dismissed without prejudice Does 1 through 100 from the Complaint.

The Court holds that it cannot enter default judgment on a cause of action to quiet title and instead must hold an evidentiary hearing on the matter. The Court will schedule an in-court prove-up for November (date not specified), 2023. The Plaintiff's Request for Default Judgment is therefore DENIED without prejudice.
