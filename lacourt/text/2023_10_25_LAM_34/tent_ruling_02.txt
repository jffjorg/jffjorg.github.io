BACKGROUND:
 
On July 28, 2021, Family Choice Private Duty Agency, Inc.
(“FCPDA”) filed its Complaint against Kamerron Easton (“Easton”) and James P.
Ashby (“Ashby”) on causes of action for breach of contract, breach of covenant
of good faith and fair dealing, and commons counts. 
 
On October 15, 2021, Easton, who is an attorney
litigating in propria persona, filed his Cross-Complaint against FCPDA
and Shellydale Princess Gray (“Gray”).
 
On October 22, 2021, Easton filed his Answer to the
Complaint. 
 
On February 8, 2022, the Court sustained in part FCPDA
and Gray’s Demurrer to the Cross-Complaint. Specifically, the Court sustained
the Demurrer to the first and sixth causes of action in the Cross-Complaint,
for breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing and intentional
infliction of emotional distress, respectively. 
 
On March 10, 2022, FCPDA and Gray filed their Answer to
the Cross-Complaint. 
 
On May 6, 2022, FCPDA and Gray filed their Amended Answer
to the Cross-Complaint. 
 
On October 7, 2022, Ashby filed his Answer to the
Complaint. 
 
On July 21, 2023, Ashby filed: (1) Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories and Request for Sanctions
(“FROGs Motion”); (2) Motion to Compel Responses to Request for Production of
Documents and for Sanctions (“RPDs Motion”); and (3) Motion to Compel Responses
to Request for Admissions and Request for Sanctions (“RFAs Motion”). In support
of each of these motions, Ashby concurrently filed Declaration of William F.
Clark. 
 
No oppositions or other responses were filed regarding the three
discovery motions. 

 
ANALYSIS:
 
        For clarity and
ease of analysis, the Court concurrently considers the FROGs Motion and RPDs
Motion. The Court then considers the RFAs Motion. 
 
I.         
FROGs Motion
and RPDs Motion
 
A.      Legal Standard
 
California Code of Civil Procedure requires a
response from the party to whom form interrogatories, special interrogatories,
and demand requests are propounded within 30 days after service of the
requests, unless the time is extended by agreement of the parties. (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.260, subd. (a), 2030.270, subd. (a), 2031.260, subd. (a),
2031.270, subd. (a).) If a party fails to serve timely responses, "the
party making the demand may move for an order compelling response to the
demand.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (b).) By failing to respond, the
offending party waives any objection to the demand. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (a).)
 
For a motion to compel, all a propounding
party must show is that it properly served its discovery requests, that the
time to respond has expired, and that the party to whom the requests were
directed failed to provide a timely response. (See Leach v. Super. Ct.
(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905, 906.) Indeed, "[o]nce [a party] 'fail[ed]
to serve a timely response,' the trial court had authority to grant [opposing
party's] motion to compel responses." (Sinaiko Healthcare Counseling,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 405.)
 
The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel motions for
interrogatories or requests for production, unless the Court finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails
to obey an order compelling answers, the court may make those orders that are
just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In
lieu of or in addition to that sanction, the court may impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c).)
 
B.      Discussion
 
Ashby moves the Court to compel
FCPDA to serve responses to the form interrogatories (“FROGs”) and requests for
production of documents (“RPDs”) that Ashby propounded on December 29, 2022 and
April 19, 2023, respectively. (FROGs Motion, pp. 2:6–12, 3:20–21 and Exh. A, p.
9; RPDs Motion, pp. 2:7–14, 3:20–21 and Exh. A, p. 3.) According to Ashby’s
Counsel, FCPDA has not responded to these discovery requests. (FROGs Motion,
Decl. Clark, ¶ 6; RPDs Motion, Decl. Clark, ¶ 6.)
 
FCPDA has not opposed this motion. There
is no evidence before the Court that would indicate FCPDA responded to these
discovery requests. 
 
The Court GRANTS the FROGs Motion and the RPDs Motion. FCPDA shall
provide initial responses to the FROGs and RPDs within 14 days of the issuance
of this Order.
 
C.      Sanctions
 
For each of these motions, Ashby requests monetary sanctions. 
 
FCPDA failed to serve a timely response to the FROGs and RPDs. Thus,
the Court must normally impose a monetary sanction on FCPDA. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c).)
 
Ashby’s Counsel declares: (1) that their hourly rate is $500.00 per
hour; (2) that they anticipate spending 5.6 hours on the FROGs Motion and 6.0
hours on the RPDs Motion; and (3) that they spent $60.00 per motion in costs
for the filing fee. (FROGs Motion, Decl. Clark, ¶ 7; RPDs Motion, Decl. Clark,
¶ 7.)
 
Counsel states that he is “an attorney specializing in business litigation
for over forty (40) years.”  (Clark Declaration,
¶ 7.)  He requests sanctions for 1.1
hours “in dictating letters and telephone calls regarding outstanding discovery”
for the motion to compel form interrogatories or  1.2 hours for “in dictating letters and
telephone calls regarding outstanding discovery” for the Motion to Compel Requests
for Production of Documents  (Id.)  He also “estimate[s] travel and hearing time
for the Motion, to be a minimum of three (3) hours” for each motion.  (Id.) 

 
However, the motions should not have taken an attorney with 40  years’ experience only a fraction of the time
claimed.  Each motion was 3 pages long, contained
no original research, and was clearly cut-and-pasted from previous discovery motions.  Further, the hours claimed for the hearings
are both duplicative and ridiculous. 
Counsel will not be spending 3 hours to attend each (simultaneously
held) motion hearing; further, counsel can attend these hearings virtually, so
that the total time for both motions would be less than 10 minutes.  
 
“If . .
. the Court were required to award a reasonable fee when an outrageously
unreasonable one has been asked for, claimants would be encouraged to make
unreasonable demands, knowing that the only unfavorable consequence of such
misconduct would be reduction of their fee to what they should have asked in
the first place. To discourage such greed, a severer reaction is needful.”  (Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d
621, 635 [cleaned up].)   “A fee request
that appears unreasonably inflated is a special circumstance permitting the trial court to
reduce the award or deny one altogether.” (Chavez v. City of Los Angeles
(2010) 47 Cal.4th 970, 990; Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122,
1137; Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 635.)

 
The Court declines to award sanctions. 

 
D.      Conclusion
 
The FROGs Motion and the RPDs Motion are GRANTED. FCPDA shall provide
initial responses to the FROGs and RPDs within 14 days of the issuance of this
Order.
 
The Court declines to award sanctions. 

 
II.       RFAs Motion
 
A.      Legal
Standard
 
California Code of Civil Procedure requires a
response from the party to whom the request for admissions is directed within
30 days after service of the request for admissions. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.250, subd. (a).)
 
If the party fails to serve a timely response,
“the party to whom the requests for admission are directed waives any objection
to the requests.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).)
 
The requesting party may then “move for an
order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters
specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for monetary sanction
under Chapter 7.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)
 
A court will deem requests admitted, “unless
it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed
has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the
requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.
It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
 
B.      Discussion
 
Ashby moves the Court to direct FCPDA to respond to the
Requests for Admission (“RFAs”) that Ashby propounded on December 29, 2022 or,
in the alternative, deem admitted the truth of the matters specified in the
RFAs. (RFAs Motion, pp. 2:7–13, 3:21–24 and Exh. A, p. 5.) Ashby’s Counsel
declares that no responses were served. (RFAs Motion, Decl. Clark, ¶ 6.)
 
FCPDA has not opposed the motion, and there is no evidence before the
Court that would indicate FCPDA responded to the RFAs. 
 
The Court GRANTS the RFAs Motion. The RFAs are DEEMED ADMITTED. 
 
C.      Sanctions
 
Ashby requests monetary sanctions. 
 
FCPDA failed to serve a timely response to the RFAs. Thus, the Court
must normally impose a monetary sanction on Defendant. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subd. (c).)
 
Ashby’s Counsel declares: (1) that their hourly rate is $500.00 per
hour; (2) that they anticipate spending 6.2 hours on this motion; and (3) that
they spent $60.00 in costs for the filing fee. (RFAs Motion, Decl. Clark, ¶ 7.)
 
Counsel states that he is “an attorney specializing in business litigation
for over forty (40) years.”  (Clark Declaration,
¶ 7.)  He requests sanctions for 1.4
hours “in dictating letters and telephone calls regarding outstanding discovery.”
(Id.)  He also “estimate[s] travel
and hearing time for the Motion, to be a minimum of three (3) hours” for each
motion.  (Id.)  
 
However, this motion should not have taken an attorney with 40  years’ experience only a fraction of the time
claimed.  The motion was 3 pages long, contained
no original research, and was clearly cut-and-pasted from previous discovery motions.  Further, the hours claimed for the hearing on
this motion are both duplicative and ridiculous.  Counsel will not be spending 3 hours to
attend the hearing on this motion (which will be held simultaneously with the
two other motions to compel); further, counsel can attend these hearings virtually,
so that the total time for all three motions would be less than 10 minutes. 
 
“If . . . the Court were
required to award a reasonable fee when an outrageously unreasonable one has
been asked for, claimants would be encouraged to make unreasonable demands,
knowing that the only unfavorable consequence of such misconduct would be
reduction of their fee to what they should have asked in the first place. To
discourage such greed, a severer reaction is needful.”  (Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d
621, 635 [cleaned up].)   “A fee request
that appears unreasonably inflated is a special circumstance permitting the
trial court to reduce the award or deny one altogether.” (Chavez v. City of
Los Angeles (2010) 47 Cal.4th 970, 990; Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24
Cal.4th 1122, 1137; Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 635.)
 
The Court declines to award sanctions. 

 
 
D.      Conclusion
 
The RFAs Motion is GRANTED. The RFAs are DEEMED ADMITTED. The request for
sanctions is DENIED.
