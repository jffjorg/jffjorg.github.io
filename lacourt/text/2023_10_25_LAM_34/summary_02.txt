Significant Statements:
- "If ... the Court were required to award a reasonable fee when an outrageously unreasonable one has been asked for, claimants would be encouraged to make unreasonable demands, knowing that the only unfavorable consequence of such misconduct would be reduction of their fee to what they should have asked in the first place. To discourage such greed, a severer reaction is needful." (Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 635 [cleaned up])
- "A fee request that appears unreasonably inflated is a special circumstance permitting the trial court to reduce the award or deny one altogether." (Chavez v. City of Los Angeles (2010) 47 Cal.4th 970, 990; Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1137; Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 635)

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted the motions to compel filed by Defendant James P. Ashby, requiring Family Choice Private Duty Agency, Inc. (FCPDA) to provide initial responses to the form interrogatories and requests for production of documents within 14 days. The Court has also deemed the requests for admissions admitted.

FCPDA failed to respond to the discovery requests, and the Court finds that it is necessary to impose monetary sanctions on FCPDA. However, the Court declines to award sanctions, finding that the request for sanctions is unreasonably inflated.

The Court notes that the motions to compel and requests for admissions were granted without opposition, and that FCPDA failed to serve a timely response to the discovery requests. The Court finds that the failure to serve a timely response waived any objection to the discovery requests.

The Court also notes that the attorney's fee request is unreasonably inflated and declines to award sanctions.
