ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiff requests entry of default judgment on its cause of action for
quiet title. However, the Court cannot enter default judgment on a cause of action to
quiet title. Instead, the Court must hold an evidentiary hearing on the matter,
where all parties may participate.
 
For a cause
of action to quiet title, 
 
“[t]he court shall examine into and determine the plaintiff’s
title against the claims of all the defendants. The court shall not enter
judgment by default but shall in all cases require evidence of plaintiff’s
title and hear such evidence as may be offered respecting the claims of any of
the defendants, other than claims the validity of which is admitted by the
plaintiff in the complaint. The court shall render judgment in accordance with
the evidence and the law.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 764.010.)
 
“[W]e conclude¿a quiet title judgment requires a hearing in open court. Although section 764.010 does not
mandate oral argument—and we do not hold oral argument is necessary, though it may
be helpful—the statute requires examining plaintiff's title and hearing
defendant's evidence ‘in all cases.’ Default judgment, as we have discussed,
seems not to be an option for quiet title cases.” (Harbor Vista, LLC v. HSBC Mortgage Servs. Inc. (2011)
201 Cal.App.4th 1496, 1507.)
 
        Plaintiff’s Request for Default Judgment
is DENIED without prejudice. An in-court prove-up is scheduled for November
____, 2023.
