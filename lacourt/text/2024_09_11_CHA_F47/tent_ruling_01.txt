SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This commercial unlawful detainer action arose from Defendant
Fitness International, LLC’s (Defendant) failure to pay rent to Plaintiff KB
Salt Lake III, LLC (Plaintiff) from April 2020 through April 2022.  At all relevant times, Plaintiff owned the
property located at 9119 De Soto Avenue, Chatsworth, California, 91311.  Defendant entered into a lease with Plaintiff
to build and operate a new fitness center on the premises commencing on 11/28/16
and expiring on 12/31/27.  When the
COVID-19 pandemic struck shortly after Defendant had demolished Plaintiff’s
property to begin construction of a new gym, Defendant declared it was excused
from paying rent and constructing a gym facility on and refused to give up
legal possession and control of Plaintiff’s property.  
 
On 10/7/21, Plaintiff filed this action for unlawful
detainer for nonpayment of rent.  Plaintiff
prevailed on summary judgment.  On
4/18/22, this Court entered judgment for restitution of the premises and
possession, forfeiture of the lease and for $368,389.75 in past rent and rental
damages.  On 10/10/22, this Court granted
Plaintiff’s motion for attorneys’ fees incurred through judgment based on an
attorney fee provision in the lease.  
 
Defendant appealed the judgment.  After the filing of Defendant’s opening
brief, Plaintiff’s response brief and Defendant’s reply, on 9/11/23, the Court
of Appeal held oral argument.  On
9/26/23, the Court of Appeal issued a 41-page published opinion affirming the
judgment and rejecting all of Defendant’s arguments.  On 12/8/23, the Court of Appeal issued a
remittitur indicating that Plaintiff is to recover its costs on appeal.    
 
On 1/16/24, Plaintiff filed and served the instant motion
seeking an order awarding Plaintiff its attorneys’ fees and expenses on appeal
in the amount of $278,535.00, which includes the fees for the instant motion.  On 8/26/24, Defendant filed and served a
Notice of Non-Opposition to the motion.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiff’s Request for Judicial Notice (RJN) is
granted.    
 
In ruling on the prior motion for attorneys’ fees incurred
through judgment, this Court  determined
that Plaintiff is the prevailing party entitled to recover attorneys’ fees
based on the contract between the parties. 
(See 10/10/22 Minute Order). 
The law also provides this Court with authority to award Plaintiff its
attorneys’ fees as the prevailing party on the appeal.    See
Butler-Rupp (2007) 154 CA4th 918, 924; Harbour Landing-Dolfann
(1996) 48 CA4th 260, 264-265.  
 
The trial court has the discretion to determine a
reasonable fee award after consideration of several factors, including the
nature of the litigation, its difficulty, the amount involved, the skill
required in its handling, the skill employed, the attention given, the success
or failure, and other circumstances in the case.  Cruz (2007) 155 CA4th 1270, 1274-1275.  In determining a fee award, the trial court
usually begins with the lodestar method of calculation (the number of hours
reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate).  PLCM Group, Inc. (2000) 22 C4th 1084,
1095-1097.  
 
The Court finds that the $278,535.00 in attorneys’ fees
requested by Plaintiff is reasonable based on the lodestar method of
calculation.  (See Lombardi Decl.
¶¶4-42).  Plaintiff’s attorneys spent
more than 400 hours opposing the appeal at hourly rates ranging from $620/hour to
$650/hour.  Id.  Additionally, the Court notes that the appeal
involved novel and complex issues dealing with COVID-related closure orders.  Further, Plaintiff’s counsel achieved an
excellent result by prevailing on all issues.
 
Finally, the reasonableness of the fee request is
supported by Defendant’s non-opposition to the motion.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted.
