SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
 
This action arises out of an automobile accident that
occurred on 11/13/20.  Plaintiffs Brian
Avalos, Eva Sanchez Avalos and Alejandra Jimenez (Plaintiffs) allege that
Defendant Eddie Camargo (Eddie Camargo) caused the accident which resulted in
Plaintiffs suffering personal injuries and property damage to Plaintiff Eva
Sanchez Avalos (Eva Avalos).  Plaintiffs
allege that Defendant Ruth Pelayo aka Ruth Vazquez aka Ruth Camargo (Ruth
Pelayo) is one of or the only owner of the vehicle driven by Eddie Camargo and
involved in the accident on 11/13/20.
 
On 11/8/22, Plaintiffs filed this action against Eddie
Camargo and Ruth Pelayo for: (1) General
Negligence (against Eddie Camargo), (2) Motor Vehicle
Negligence (against Eddie Camargo), (3) Negligent Infliction of Emotional
Distress (against Eddie Camargo), (4) Intentional Infliction of Emotional
Distress (against Eddie Camargo), (5) Permissive Use Statute Claim (Vehicle
Code 17149) (against Ruth Pelayo), and (6) Negligent Entrustment (against Ruth
Pelayo).
 
After Plaintiffs’ counsel failed to respond to
Defendants’ counsel’s meet and confer efforts regarding issues Defendants had
with the complaint, on 4/24/23, Defendants filed and served a  demurrer to the Fourth Cause of Action for
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress and motion to strike which sought to
strike the allegations regarding and the prayer for punitive damages in the
complaint.
 
Plaintiffs did not oppose or otherwise respond to the
demurrer and/or motion to strike.  However,
on 7/14/23, Plaintiffs dismissed their Fourth Cause of Action rendering the
demurrer and the motion to strike as it related to the Fourth Cause of Action
moot.  The motion to strike also sought
to strike allegations regarding/relating to punitive damages contained in the
factual allegations common to all Causes of Action, the Second Cause of Action
and the Third Cause of Action as well as the prayer for punitive damages in
relation to the First, Second, Third and Fourth Causes of Action.
On 7/27/23, the Court granted the motion to strike
without leave to amend and placed the demurrer off calendar as moot.  (See 7/27/23 Minute Order).  
 
On 2/26/24, the parties stipulated to continue the then
8/19/24 trial date.  Within that
stipulation, it was stated that Defendants intended to serve verifications and
further responses to five sets of written discovery propounded by
Plaintiffs.  As a result, the Court
ordered the trial date continued to 2/24/25 and ordered the discovery deadlines
and cut-offs to correspond to the new trial date.  (See 2/26/24 Stipulation &
Order).  
 
On 3/13/24, Defendants filed a Notice of Change of
Handling Attorney.  (See Notice
filed 3/13/24).  As of 8/13/24,
Defendants have not served verifications or further responses.  (See O’Hara Decl.).  The current handling attorney for Defendants,
Khelya Okunor, has failed to adequately respond to Plaintiffs’ counsel’s meet
and confer efforts regarding the discovery responses, refused to stipulate to
continue the current trial date and indicated that Defendants’ would likely
oppose a motion to continue the trial date. 
(See O’Hara Decl.).
 
Therefore, on 8/13/24, Plaintiffs filed and served the
instant motion seeking an order continuing the current 2/24/25 trial date to
8/24/25 or another convenient date), and extending discovery to track the new
trial date.  Defendants have not opposed
or otherwise responded to the motion.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiffs’ Request for Judicial Notice is granted.  
 
Upon a showing of good cause, a trial court should grant
a request to continue the trial date.  See
CRC 3.1332; Lerma (2004) 120 CA4th 709, 716; Elkins (2007) 41
C4th 1337, 1364.  A party’s excused
inability to obtain essential discovery despite diligent efforts constitutes
such good cause.  See CRC
3.1332(c)(6).  
 
Other factors the court must consider in determining
whether to grant a continuance of the trial date are: “(1) The proximity of the
trial date; (2) Whether there was any previous continuance, extension of time,
or delay of trial due to any party; (3) The length of the continuance
requested; (4) The availability of alternative means to address the problem
that gave rise to the motion to application for a continuance; (5) The
prejudice that parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance;
(6) If the case is entitled to a preferential trial setting, the reasons for
that status and whether the need for a continuance outweighs the need to avoid
delay; (7) The court’s calendar and the impact of granting a continuance on
other pending trials; (8) Whether trial counsel is engaged in another trial; (9)
Whether all parties have stipulated to a continuance; (10) Whether the
interests of justice are best served by a continuance, by the trial of the
matter or by imposing conditions on the continuance, and (11) Any other fact or
circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the motion or application.”  CRC 3.1332(d). 
 
As set forth in the unopposed motion, the Court finds
that the foregoing factors weigh in favor of granting a trial continuance under
the circumstances.  (See Motion,
p.7:12-p.9:3).  Similarly, the Court
finds that under the circumstances the discovery deadlines should correspond
with the new trial date.  
Granting the continuance will allow Plaintiffs sufficient
time to have their discovery motions heard and, if granted, sufficient time for
Defendants to provide further responses and Plaintiff to use such information
to prepare for trial.  
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted. 

 
The Court notes that, at times, Plaintiffs failed to use
the official report citation when citing cases. 
(See Motion, p.6:20-21 citation to Lerner, p.6:27 citation
to Elkins).  The parties are
advised to use the official report citations in future briefs filed with the
Court.  See CRC 3.1113(c).
