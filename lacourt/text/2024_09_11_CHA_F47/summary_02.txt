And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion to continue the current trial date from February 24, 2025, to August 24, 2025, or another convenient date, and extends discovery to track the new trial date. The motion was filed by the plaintiffs, Brian Avalos, Eva Sanchez Avalos, and Alejandra Jimenez, who are seeking compensation for personal injuries and property damage sustained in an automobile accident on November 13, 2020. The accident was caused by defendant Eddie Camargo, who was driving a vehicle owned by defendant Ruth Pelayo.

The judge finds that the parties have failed to adequately respond to each other's discovery requests, and that the current handling attorney for the defendants, Khelya Okunor, has refused to stipulate to a continuance of the trial date. The judge also notes that the parties have failed to use the official report citation when citing cases.

The judge considers various factors in determining whether to grant a continuance of the trial date, including the proximity of the trial date, whether there was any previous continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to any party, the length of the continuance requested, the availability of alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the motion, the prejudice that parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance, and the court's calendar.

The judge concludes that the factors weigh in favor of granting a trial continuance under the circumstances. The grant of the continuance will allow the plaintiffs sufficient time to have their discovery motions heard and, if granted, sufficient time for the defendants to provide further responses and for the plaintiffs to use the information to prepare for trial.
