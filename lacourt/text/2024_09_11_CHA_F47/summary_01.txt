And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge granted the Plaintiff's motion for attorneys' fees on appeal in the amount of $278,535.00. The motion was filed by the Plaintiff, KB Salt Lake III, LLC, seeking an order awarding its attorneys' fees and expenses on appeal. The Plaintiff had previously prevailed on summary judgment and was awarded judgment for restitution of the premises, possession, forfeiture of the lease, and past rent and rental damages. The Defendant, Fitness International, LLC, appealed the judgment, but the Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment and rejected all of Defendant's arguments.

The Judge found that the Plaintiff is the prevailing party entitled to recover attorneys' fees based on the contract between the parties and the law. The Court used the lodestar method of calculation to determine a reasonable fee award, considering factors such as the nature of the litigation, its difficulty, the amount involved, the skill required in its handling, the skill employed, the attention given, the success or failure, and other circumstances in the case. The Judge found that the requested attorneys' fees were reasonable based on the lodestar method of calculation, taking into account the more than 400 hours spent opposing the appeal at hourly rates ranging from $620/hour to $650/hour. The Defendant's non-opposition to the motion also supported the reasonableness of the fee request.
