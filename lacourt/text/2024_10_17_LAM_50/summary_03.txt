And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by the defendants to deem plaintiff Anne Kihagi a vexatious litigant and require her to furnish security in the amount of $195,000. The court has continued the hearing on the motion due to procedural issues with the opposition papers filed by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs' opposition papers exceed the page limit set by the California Rules of Court and do not include a table of contents or a table of authorities, as required by the rules. The court has ordered the plaintiffs to file and serve amended opposition papers that comply with the page number requirement and format requirements by a certain date. The defendants may also file and serve new reply papers by the same date. The court has also ordered the defendants to give notice of the order.
