[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:
 
DEFENDANT’S
  MOTION FOR ORDER REQUIRING PLAINTIFF TO FURNISH SECURITY AS A VEXATIOUS
  LITIGANT
 




 
Background
Plaintiffs
Nivo 1, LLC, DA BEEC-007, LLC, and Anne Kihagi (“Kihagi”) (collectively,
“Plaintiffs”) filed this action on May 6, 2021 against Defendants Lin Dee Lu
Services, Yu Sheng Victor Liu, and Xiang Liu. On April 26, 2022, Plaintiffs
filed the operative First Amended Complaint, alleging nine causes of action. 
On
July 31, 2022, Plaintiffs filed an Amendment to Complaint substituting the name
“Lin Dee Liu Services”
for the incorrect name “Lin Dee Lu Services.” On December 13, 2022, Plaintiffs
filed an Amendment to Complaint naming Eric Liu in place of “Doe 2,” and an
Amendment to Complaint naming Building Future Foundation in place of “Doe 3.” 
Defendants
Lin Dee Liu dba Lin
Dee Liu Services, Yu Sheng Victor Liu, Xiang Liu, Eric
Liu, and Building Future Foundation (collectively, “Defendants”) now move for
an order deeming Kihagi a vexatious litigant and requiring her to furnish
security in the amount of $195,000. Plaintiffs oppose. 
 
            Discussion
A.             Procedural Issues 
As an
initial matter, in the reply, Defendants assert that “[t]he Opposition brief is 21 pages long
and lacks tables of contents and authorities, in violation of CRC Rule 3.1113(d) and (f). It also was not
served on Defendants, who had to download it from the Court website…The
Opposition papers should be stricken.” (Reply at p. 1, fn. 1.) 
Pursuant
to California Rules of Court, rule 3.1113, subdivision (d), “[e]xcept
in a summary judgment or summary adjudication motion, no opening or responding
memorandum may exceed 15 pages. In a
summary judgment or summary adjudication motion, no opening or responding
memorandum may exceed 20 pages. No reply or closing memorandum may exceed 10
pages. The page limit does not include the caption page, the notice of motion
and motion, exhibits, declarations, attachments, the table of contents, the
table of authorities, or the proof of service.” (Emphasis added.) Here, Plaintiffs’ opposition is 21
pages, well exceeding the applicable page limit. Plaintiffs do not appear to cite any Court order authorizing
them to include additional pages in the opposition.  
In addition, pursuant to
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1113, subdivision (f), “[a] memorandum that exceeds 10 pages must include a table of contents
and a table of authorities.” As noted by Defendants, Plaintiffs’ opposition
does not contain a table of contents or a table of authorities. 
In addition, in
connection with the reply, Defendants submit the declaration of their counsel, David
B. Tillotson. Mr. Tillotson’s declaration, which was “[e]xecuted October 10,
2024,” provides, inter alia, that “[m]y office pulled the Opposition to
the Motion Requiring Plaintiff to Furnish Security off the court website today.
I saw the proof of service purporting indicate [sic] that I was served by
electronic mail on October 3, 2024. I did not recall seeing any such email
service.” (Tillotson Decl., ¶ 2.) Mr. Tillotson states that “I went back and
reviewed all of my incoming email traffic. I also reviewed my spam filter,
deleted items and trash. I did not receive any service emails serving the
Opposition…Our office promptly reached out to opposing counsel to inquire about
the service, noting that the language used for the Proof of Service does not
appear to apply to us and this case. We asked for confirmation that the
documents had been served. Opposing counsel did not respond to our email.
Attached hereto as Exhibit A is a true and correct copy of that email.” (Tillotson
Decl., ¶¶ 3-4, Ex. A.)[1]
The
Court notes that Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 1005, subdivision
(b), “[a]ll papers opposing a motion so noticed shall be filed with the
court and a copy served on each party at least nine court days, and all reply
papers at least five court days before the hearing.” In addition, “[a]ny period of notice, or any right or duty to do any act
or make any response within any period or on a date certain after the service
of the document, which time period or date is prescribed by statute or rule of
court, shall be extended after service by electronic means by two court days…” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6, subd. (a)(3)(B).)
In light of the foregoing
procedural issues, the Court continues the hearing
on the instant motion. 
Conclusion 
In light of the foregoing issues, the Court continues the hearing on
Defendants’ motion to ____________, 2024, at 2:00 p.m. in Dept. 50. 
On
or before ____________, 2024, Plaintiffs are to file and serve amended
opposition papers that comply with the page number requirement set forth in California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1113, subdivision (d), as well as the
format requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1113, subdivision (f).
 Courtesy copies shall be delivered to Dept. 50. No new evidence
or new argument is to be submitted in Plaintiffs’ amended opposition papers.
On
or before ____________, 2024, Defendants may file and serve new reply
papers
that will supersede the previously filed reply. Courtesy copies of any
new reply papers shall be delivered to Dept. 50. 
Defendants are ordered to give notice of this Order.¿¿
