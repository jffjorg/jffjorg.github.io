And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment filed by Defendant Delmer James McEntyre. The judge finds that the single cause of action for declaratory relief in the First Amended Derivative Complaint is moot, and Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on that claim. However, the judge notes that the Plaintiff's complaint also seeks damages for MFP, LLC, and that the Court appointed a receiver to take control of all the assets of the LLC. The judge requests that the parties address at the hearing the issue of the claim for damages for the LLC, including the nature of the damages asserted and who is entitled to assert that claim. The judge also suggests that Plaintiff may need to file a Second Amended Complaint to specify the types of damages being claimed.
