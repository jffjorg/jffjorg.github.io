Translation:

The court has ruled on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc. in the case of Tony Barbarini vs. American Honda Motor Co., Inc.

* The demurrer is denied as to the fifth cause of action for fraudulent concealment.
* The motion to strike is denied.
* The court orders the plaintiff to keep accurate time records for non-Song-Beverly claims.

The court has also ruled that the economic loss doctrine does not bar the cause of action for fraudulent concealment.

The case is about a defective computerized driver-assisting safety system in a 2022 Honda Accord. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant concealed or suppressed material facts regarding the system's defects and that he would not have purchased the vehicle if he had known about the defects. The defendant disputes the allegations and argues that the plaintiff failed to plead sufficient facts to support the cause of action.

The court found that the allegations are sufficient to support the elements of fraudulent concealment and that the economic loss doctrine does not bar the cause of action. The court also noted that the defendant's motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages is denied in light of the ruling on the demurrer to the fraudulent concealment cause of action.
