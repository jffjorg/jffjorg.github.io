BACKGROUND
On May 27, 2021, plaintiffs Lee
Cynthia Wynder, Vincent Wynder, and Latonya Renay Wynder filed a complaint
against Grace Memorial Chapel and Funeral Home, Inc., New Gardens Memorial
Chapel & Funeral Home, Inc., and Vincent B. Wilson for (1) negligence, (2)
IIED, and (3) breach of contract. 
On November 1, 2022, plaintiffs
filed a request for dismissal as to New Gardens Memorial Chapel & Funeral
Home, Inc. and Vincent B. Wilson.
On May 2, 2022, the court granted
defendant Grace Memorial Chapel’s motion to set aside and vacate the default
entered against it.
Trial is set for August 28, 2024.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
Pursuant to CRC Rule 3.1332, “(a)
To ensure the prompt disposition of civil cases, the dates assigned for a trial
are firm.  All parties and their counsel
must regard the date set for trial as certain. 
(b) A party seeking a continuance of the date set for trial, whether
contested or uncontested or stipulated to by the parties, must make the request
for a continuance by a noticed motion or an ex parte application under the
rules in chapter 4 of this division, with supporting declarations.  The party must make the motion or application
as soon as reasonably practical once the necessity for the continuance is
discovered.  (c) Although continuances of
trials are disfavored, each request for a continuance must be considered on its
own merits.  The court may grant a
continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the
continuance. . . .”   
            CRC Rule 3.1332(d) sets forth other
factors that are relevant in determining whether to grant a continuance.
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiffs
request that the Court continue the August 28, 2024 trial date until January
2025, reopen discovery until thirty days prior to the new trial date, and order
this case into the Personal Injury Mandatory Settlement Conference Program.
            Plaintiffs
argue that there is good cause for a trial continuance because defendant’s
attorney has not (recently) communicated with plaintiffs’ attorney, “probably
due to health issues,” and therefore plaintiffs have not been able to resolve
ongoing discovery disputes, discuss settlement, and prepare for trial.  Curt Steindler decl., ¶2.  Plaintiffs explain that on April 19, 2024,
defendant responded to discovery.  On May
3, 2024, plaintiffs’ counsel sent an email to defense counsel to meet and
confer that the “responses were deficient.” 
On May 6, 2024, defense counsel responded that he would “extend anytime
applicable to your clients’ deadline to file any motion to compel further
responses until we respond to the substance of your meet and confer
email.”  Plaintiffs’ counsel sent an
email on May 24, 2024 regarding the discovery. 
On May 27, 2024, defense counsel responded that he was trying to get
more information to provide discovery responses.  On May 30, 2024, counsel met and conferred by
phone, and defense counsel agreed that defendant would provide supplemental
responses and that “it would be a good idea to continue the trial and also
agreed to having the case referred to the Personal Injury Mandatory Settlement
Conference Program.”  Plaintiffs assert
that defense counsel “also apologized for his slow communication because he had
been so ill for the past month that he was admitted to the hospital.”  Plaintiffs explain further that plaintiffs’
counsel has not had any further communication from defense counsel except for
defendant’s demand for exchange of expert information.  See Steindler decl.
            The
Court finds that plaintiffs have shown good cause for a continuance.  
The
motion is GRANTED.
 
ORDER
            The
motion is GRANTED.
            The
August 21, 2024 final status conference is continued to January 3, 2025 at 9:00
a.m.  The August 28, 2024 trial date is
continued to January 8, 2025 at 10:00 a.m.
The
discovery cut-off date is as to the new trial date.  The case is referred to the Personal Injury
Mandatory Settlement Conference Program.
            Plaintiffs
are ordered to give notice of the ruling.
