And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the complaint filed by Brandon Reynolds and Cashmine Crawford against Zarna Surti and Tarun Surti is dismissed without prejudice as to Cashmine Crawford. The ruling is based on the fact that Cashmine Crawford failed to comply with the court's November 2, 2023 ruling, which ordered her to serve responses to defendants' discovery requests within 60 days. The court also found that plaintiff's counsel failed to serve notice of the November 2, 2023 ruling to Cashmine Crawford and failed to obtain an order to serve on her. The court notes that there is confusion over whether plaintiff's counsel had authority to file the complaint on Cashmine Crawford's behalf and whether Cashmine Crawford was aware of the November 2, 2023 ruling. The court declines to impose additional monetary sanctions and grants the motion to dismiss the complaint without prejudice as to Cashmine Crawford.
