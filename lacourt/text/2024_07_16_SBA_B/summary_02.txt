And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiffs' motion to continue the trial date from August 28, 2024, to January 8, 2025, and to reopen discovery until thirty days prior to the new trial date. The August 21, 2024 final status conference is also continued to January 3, 2025, and the case is referred to the Personal Injury Mandatory Settlement Conference Program. The Judge finds that the plaintiffs have shown good cause for the continuance due to the defense counsel's slow communication due to health issues, which has hindered the plaintiffs' ability to resolve ongoing discovery disputes, discuss settlement, and prepare for trial.
