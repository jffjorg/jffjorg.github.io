 Case Number:  23PSCV03961    Hearing Date:   May 16, 2024    Dept:  K Plaintiff
Wesco Insurance Company’s Application for Default Judgment is DENIED without
prejudice.
Background   
Plaintiff Wesco Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”)
seeks subrogation for a September 25, 2022 motor vehicle accident.
On December 21, 2023, Plaintiff
filed a complaint, asserting a cause of action against Edgar Cisneros
(“Defendant”) and Does 1-10 for:
1.                 
Motor Vehicle
On March 1, 2024, Defendant’s
default was entered.
A Case Management Conference is
set for May 16, 2024.
Discussion
Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment is denied without
prejudice. The following defects are noted:
1.                 
Plaintiff seeks $93,019.09 in special damages as set
forth in Paragraph 2 of its Judicial Council Form CIV-100 Request for Court
Judgment; however, Plaintiff’s complaint is devoid of any monetary amounts
(Paragraph 14 therein states that the amount of damages is “according to
proof”). In actions for money damages a default judgment is limited to the
amount demanded in the complaint. (See Greenup
v. Rodman (1986) 42 Cal.3d 822, 824.) The amount demanded in the complaint
is determined both from the prayer and from the damage allegations in the
complaint. (National Diversified
Services, Inc. v. Bernstein (1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 410, 417-418). Plaintiff’s
complaint is factually scant and consists of one cause of action for “Motor
Vehicle,” with a notation on the first page indicating that it is for
“subrogation.” The Case Summary, however, confirms that it is not a personal
injury/wrongful death action. The Case Summary indicates that Plaintiff is a
commercial property insurance provider whose insured, DZ Restaurant Group Inc.
(“DZ”), sustained property damages from a motor vehicle operated by Defendant
on September 25, 2022. Since this is not a personal injury/wrongful death
action, Plaintiff cannot attempt to remedy the lack of monetary figures in the
complaint via the Statement of Damages filed March 25, 2024. (See Sole
Energy Co. v. Hodges (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 199, 206, fn. 4
[“Statements of damages are used only in personal injury and wrongful death
cases, in which the plaintiff may not state the damages sought in the
complaint. (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.11.) In all other cases, when recovering
damages in a default judgment, the plaintiff is limited to the damages
specified in the complaint”].) Plaintiff, at any rate, has not provided an
executed proof of service for the Statement of Damages reflecting service of
same prior to entry of default, as required (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.11; Hamm
v. Elkin (1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 1343, 1346).
2.                 
Plaintiff has not provided the court with any evidence
as to Defendant’s liability.
