 Case Number:  KC067035    Hearing Date:   May 16, 2024    Dept:  K Plaintiff Wong &
Mak, LLP’s unopposed Motion for Clerk’s Deed is GRANTED. 
Background   
Plaintiff Wong &
Mak, LLP (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows:
On
November 12, 2018, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Zhen Hai Wu (“Zhen”) in
case styled Wong & Mak, LLP, et al. v. Wu, et al., Case No. GC041978
(“Underlying Action”), alleging therein that Zhen had fraudulently conveyed the
property located at 1251 N. Stimson Avenue in La Puente (“the La Puente
Property”) to Wei Niu (“Niu”). On November 20, 2008, Plaintiff recorded a lis
pendens against the La Puente Property. On May 26, 2009, Plaintiff obtained a
judgment against Wu in the Underlying Action which, inter alia, voided the May
5, 2008 transfer of the La Puente Property from Zhen to Niu. On June 5, 2009,
Zhen transferred the La Puente Property to his daughter, Daria Wu (“Daria”), by
quitclaim deed. Plaintiff did not discover the aforesaid transfer until
approximately July 1, 2014.
On August 1, 2014,
Plaintiff filed a complaint, asserting causes of action against Daria and Does
1-20 for:
1.                 
Fraudulent
Conveyance 
2.                 
Cancellation
of Instruments 
On December 15,
2014, Daria’s default was entered. On April 3, 2015, judgment was entered. On
April 8, 2015, an “Amended Judgment” was entered.
On December 12,
2019, a second “Amended Judgment” was entered.
Discussion
Plaintiff moves the court for a
clerk’s deed transferring the La Puente Property to Plaintiff.
The court has authority under Code of Civil Procedure § 128, subdivision
(a)(4)[1],
to appoint the clerk of the court as an elisor to execute the aforesaid
documents. (See Blueberry Properties, LLC v. Chow (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th
1027 [“A court typically appoints an elisor to sign documents on behalf of a
recalcitrant party in order to effectuate its judgments or orders, where the
party refuses to execute such documents”]; Rayan v. Dykeman (1990) 224
Cal.App.3d 1629.)
On December 12,
2019, an “Amended Judgment” was entered. (Wong Decl., ¶¶ 4-5, Exh. B). The
Amended Judgment, inter alia, orders Daria to transfer title to the La
Puente Property. (Id.) Daria has failed and refused to transfer title to
the La Puente Property, as ordered by the court. (Id., ¶ 7). The motion,
then, is granted.
