Here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses the demurrer to Walter Ocheaga's cross-complaint and the motion to strike portions of the cross-complaint. The court rules that Haha Smart, Inc.'s demurrer to Ocheaga's first cause of action (breach of contract) is overruled, as Ocheaga has pled breach, performance, and damages. However, Haha Smart, Inc.'s demurrer to the second cause of action (false promise) is sustained, as Ocheaga has failed to plead the required elements of promissory fraud. Similarly, Haha Smart, Inc.'s demurrer to the third cause of action (tortious breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing) is sustained, as there is no special relationship or fiduciary characteristics between the parties. The court also sustains Haha Smart, Inc.'s demurrer to the fourth through sixth causes of action (fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and intentional misrepresentation), as Ocheaga has failed to plead the required elements with specificity. With respect to the motion to strike, the court denies Haha Smart, Inc.'s motion as moot in part (i.e., as to punitive damages language and request for relief) and grants the motion in part (i.e., as to attorney's fees), as Ocheaga has not articulated a contractual or statutory basis for attorney's fees.
