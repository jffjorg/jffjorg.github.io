The tentative ruling denies plaintiff Wesco Insurance Company's application for default judgment without prejudice. The court notes two defects: first, the complaint lacks monetary amounts, and second, plaintiff has not provided evidence of defendant Edgar Cisneros' liability. The court cites relevant case law, including Greenup v. Rodman and Sole Energy Co. v. Hodges, to support its decision. The ruling sets a Case Management Conference for May 16, 2024.
