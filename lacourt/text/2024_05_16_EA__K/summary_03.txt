Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Zhen Hai Wu fraudulently conveyed the property to Wei Niu, and that Defendant Daria Wu has failed and refused to transfer title to the property as ordered by the court. The court's judgment orders Daria to transfer title to the property, but Daria has not complied. The motion for a clerk's deed is granted.
