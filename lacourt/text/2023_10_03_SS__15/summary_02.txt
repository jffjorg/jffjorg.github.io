And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is in response to Walmart Inc.'s motion to compel further responses from Plaintiffs Elizabeth Bowman and Gary Bowman to Form Interrogatory No. 17.1. The Judge finds that Plaintiffs' responses are defective and do not comply with California Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.230, which requires detailed identification of documents supporting the responses. The Judge orders Plaintiffs to serve further responses within 20 days. The Judge also denies Walmart Inc.'s request for $3,198 in sanctions, finding that both sides have failed to engage in good faith attempts to resolve discovery disputes.
