**English Summary:**

The judge is considering whether a California court has the authority to hear a case against Vanderbilt Minerals, LLC, Inc.  Plaintiffs allege the company's talc caused Stephen Anderson's mesothelioma. Vanderbilt Minerals argues it doesn't have enough ties to California to be subject to jurisdiction there.  

The judge has postponed a decision to allow both sides to conduct further investigation into whether Vanderbilt Minerals' talc was actually used in the specific products that Anderson was exposed to. This investigation will help determine whether there's a strong enough connection between the company and the state to justify hearing the case in California.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that Vanderbilt Minerals, LLC's motion to quash service of summons for lack of personal jurisdiction will be continued until December 19, 2023, for jurisdictional discovery. The judge has required the parties to conduct discovery to determine whether Vanderbilt Minerals, LLC's talc was in the DAP caulk products to which Stephen Anderson was exposed. The judge has also ordered the parties to file supplemental briefs in support of their positions. The court's decision is based on the fact that Vanderbilt Minerals, LLC is incorporated in Delaware and has its principal place of business in Connecticut, and therefore is not a resident of California and not subject to its general jurisdiction. However, the court has found that Vanderbilt Minerals, LLC may be subject to California's specific jurisdiction if it can be shown that the company's talc was used in products that caused injury in California. The judge has ordered further discovery to determine whether this is the case.
