And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is not making a final decision on the motion to quash service of summons filed by Vanderbilt Minerals, LLC. Instead, the court is continuing the motion to December 19, 2023, for jurisdictional discovery to determine whether Vanderbilt Minerals' talc was used in the DAP caulk products to which Stephen Anderson was exposed. The judge is requiring the parties to file a supplemental opposition and reply, respectively, on regular notice. The court is allowing jurisdictional discovery to proceed to gather evidence on whether Vanderbilt Minerals is subject to California's personal jurisdiction.
