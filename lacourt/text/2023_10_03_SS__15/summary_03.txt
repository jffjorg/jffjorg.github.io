And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively granted the motion for trial preference filed by Plaintiff Margarita Colemenero, who is 80 years old and suffering from mesothelioma. The motion was filed on May 25, 2023, and the court has reviewed the declarations submitted in support of the motion. The declarations show that Plaintiff has a substantial interest in the action and that her health is such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing her interest in the litigation. The court has discretion to grant a motion for trial preference accompanied by clear and convincing medical documentation, and the court finds that Plaintiff's medical diagnosis and prognosis meet this standard. Subject to Plaintiff filing a proof of service for Himmel Management Co. LLC or dismissing the defendant, the motion for trial setting preference is granted. The trial is set for January 29, 2024 at 9 a.m., and the Final Status Conference is set for January 16, 2024 at 9 a.m. The court also sets a status conference regarding the trial setting order for October 11, 2023 at 8:30 a.m.
