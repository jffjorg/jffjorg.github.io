## English Text Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses Plaintiff Margarita Colemenero's motion for trial preference. Colemenero, who is 80 years old and suffering from mesothelioma, seeks a preference due to her age and health condition. 

The judge acknowledges that Colemenero has provided medical evidence supporting her need for a preference and finds that her health is such that a preference is necessary to protect her interests in the litigation.

However, the judge notes that Plaintiff failed to properly serve the complaint on one defendant, Himmel Management Co. LLC. Before the hearing, Plaintiff must either provide proof of service for this defendant or dismiss them from the case.

Subject to this requirement, the judge intends to grant Colemenero's motion for trial preference and set the trial for January 29, 2024.
