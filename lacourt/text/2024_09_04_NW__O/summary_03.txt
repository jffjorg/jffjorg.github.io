And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's claim for punitive damages. The plaintiff alleged dental malpractice and sought punitive damages, but did not obtain leave of court to include such damages in the complaint. The defendant moved to strike the claim, and the plaintiff did not file an opposition. The court found that the plaintiff did not comply with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure § 425.13(a), which requires a showing of a substantial probability of prevailing on the claim. The court ordered the plaintiff to file an amended complaint reflecting the ruling by September 20, 2024.
