  FOR ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY, LLC, AND DAVID AUERBACH, M.D.’S DEMURRER WITH LEAVE
  TO AMEND 
 
 
 
 
 



 
I.        INTRODUCTION
This case
arises out of a shoulder injuries Plaintiff Timothy Best (“Plaintiff”)
allegedly suffered after a surgical procedure on his fingers. Plaintiff alleges
the surgery took place at Defendant Center for Orthopedic Surgery (“Center”),
was performed by Defendant David Auerbach (“Auerbach”) of Defendant Southern California
Orthopedic Institute, LP (“Institute”)(in conjunction with UCLA Health, sued as
The Regents of the University of California (“Regents”)). Plaintiff further
alleges Defendant Cassandre Casseus, CRNA (“Casseus”, erroneously served as
Ribeiro), of Defendant SCOI Anesthesia Medical Corporation (“SCOI”), assisted
Auerbach during the surgery by administering anesthesia, including an
infraclavicular shoulder block (“shoulder block”) that Plaintiff did not
consent to and that caused Plaintiff’s shoulder injuries at the heart of this
action. 
Defendants Center, Auerbach, and Institute (“Demurring Defendants”) now demurrer
to Plaintiff’s eighth cause of action for medical battery.

III.     LEGAL
STANDARD
A demurrer is a pleading used to test
the legal sufficiency of other pleadings. It raises issues of law, not
fact, regarding the form or content of the opposing party’s pleading
(complaint, answer or cross-complaint). (See Code of Civ. Proc. §§
422.10, 589(a); see Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116
Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)[1] It
is not the function of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the
complaint; and for purposes of the ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in
the complaint are assumed to be true. (See Donabedian, 116 Cal.App.4th
at 994.) 
“We treat the demurrer as admitting all
material facts properly pleaded but not contentions, deductions or conclusions
of fact or law. We accept the factual allegations of the complaint as true and
also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.” (Mitchell v.
California Dept. of Pub. Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007, citation
omitted.) “[T]he facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true, however
improbable they may be. (Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981)
123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604.) Allegations are to be liberally construed. (See
Code of Civ. Proc. § 452.) A demurrer may be brought if insufficient facts are
stated to support the cause of action asserted. (See Code of Civ. Proc.
§ 430.10(e).)  
“A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a
complaint as a matter of law.” (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010)
183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.) “[T]he court gives the complaint a reasonable
interpretation, and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded.” (Id.) In testing the sufficiency of the
complaint, the court must assume the truth of (1) the properly pleaded factual
allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably inferred from those expressly
pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (See Blank v. Kirwan (1985)
39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence
or other extrinsic matters. (See SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984)
153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) No other extrinsic evidence can be considered. (See
Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 881 [error for court
to consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting demurrer]; see also Afuso
v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862
[disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos.
(1988) 46 Cal.3d 287] [error to consider contents of release not part of court
record].) Accordingly, “[w]hether the plaintiff will be able to prove the
pleaded facts is irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer.” (Stevens v.
Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 605, 609-10.) 
A demurrer can only be sustained when
it disposes of an entire cause of action. (See Poizner v. Fremont
General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of Hawaiian
Gardens Redev. Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.) Leave to
amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. (See Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The
burden is on the complainant to show the Court a pleading can be amended
successfully. (Id.) However, “[i]f there is any reasonable possibility
that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to sustain a
demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).  
IV.     MEET AND CONFER
Before
filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party shall meet
and confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference with the party
who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of
determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a),
emphasis added.) A declaration must be filed with a demurrer regarding the
results of the meet and confer process. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a)(3).)
          Demurring Defendants filed
a declaration attesting to the parties’ telephonic meet and confer and
unsuccessful attempt to come to an informal resolution. (See Declaration
of John Reilley filed June 26, 2024, ¶¶
5-6.) The
Court therefore finds the parties have fulfilled their meet and confer
requirements.

V.       ANALYSIS  
A.            
Plaintiff Fails to State a Medical Battery Cause
of Action Against Auerbach
The
elements of medical battery are 1) that the defendant either performed a medical
procedure without the plaintiff’s consent, or alternatively, that the plaintiff
consented to one medical procedure, but the defendant performed a substantially
different medical procedure; 2) that the plaintiff was harmed, and 3) that the
defendant’s conduct was a substantial factor in causing the plaintiff’s harm. (See
Cobbs v. Grant (1972) 8 Cal.3d 229, 239; see also Conte v. Girard
Orthopaedic Surgeons Medical Group, Inc. (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 1260,
1267-1268; see also Saxena v. Goffney (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 316,
324-325; see also CACI 530A [Medical Battery].)
Demurring
Defendants argue Plaintiff’s eighth cause of action is uncertain and fails to
state a cause of action. (See Demurrer, pp.5-8) Specifically, Demurring
Defendants argue Plaintiff fails to allege Auerbach performed a procedure
without Plaintiff’s consent. (See id. at 6.) Rather, Demurring
Defendants argue Plaintiff alleges Casseus,
not Auerbach, was the medical provider who performed the shoulder block at
issue, and that the medical records do not say which medical procedure actually
ordered the shoulder block. (See id.) Demurring Defendants also argue Plaintiff’s
eighth cause of action is really one for lack of informed consent and is thus
duplicative of Plaintiff’s first cause of action for medical negligence. (See
id. at 7-8.)
In opposition, Plaintiff argues “[i]t is true
that at the time the Complaint was prepared and filed Plaintiff did not know
whether there was an order by Dr. Auerback [sic] for the shoulder block,”
however in “discovery has confirmed that Dr. Auerback [sic]…did indeed order a
shoulder block to be administered despite Plaintiff's resistance.” (See Opposition,
pg. 2.) 
In reply, Demurring Defendants argue Plaintiff
has improperly attempted to introduce extraneous information obtained in
discovery. (See Reply, pg.2.) 
As a preliminary matter, the Court does not find
Plaintiff’s eighth cause of action uncertain. “[D]emurrers
for uncertainty are
disfavored and are granted only if the pleading is so incomprehensible that a
defendant cannot reasonably respond.” (Mahan v. Charles W. Chan Ins. Agency,
Inc. (2017) 14 Cal.App.5th 841, 848, n. 3 (citations omitted).) Plaintiff’s
eighth cause of action is not so incomprehensible that Demurring Defendants
cannot reasonably respond.
The Court agrees, however, that
Plaintiff fails to state a cause of action for medical battery against
Auerbach. Plaintiff’s Complaint states the “shoulder block was administered by [SCOI]…
Said shoulder block was performed by [Casseus]….[Casseus] told [Plaintiff] that
she was going to perform the shoulder block. [Plaintiff] told [Casseus] that he
did not want this block because he was getting general anesthesia…[a]fter 4-5
"sticks" into [Plaintiff’s] body, [Casseus] achieved the shoulder
block and then the finger surgical repaired was performed and completed. There
is no information in the medical records as to [sic] actually ordered the
shoulder block.” (See Complaint, pg. 5, ¶ 13.) Plaintiff’s
Complaint later alleges “[i]f Auerbach ordered the shoulder block or was aware
that it was going to be administered to Best, it would constitute a medical
battery; an unconsented to medical procedure on the part of Auerbach.” (See
id. at pg.
15, ¶ 72.)
Battery in an intentional tort.
(See Saxena, 159 Cal.App.4th at 324.) Here, Plaintiff fails to
allege Auerbach was even involved in administering or deciding to administer
the shoulder block, and certainly does not allege Auerbach’s intentional
conduct was a substantial factor that caused Plaintiff’s alleged injuries. Rather,
Plaintiff alleges Casseus and SOCI administered and performed the shoulder block
and there is no information as to who ordered the shoulder block. 
Plaintiff has thus failed to
state sufficient facts to sustain a cause of action for medical battery as to
Auerbach. The Court will not consider Plaintiff’s attempts to introduce
evidence obtained in discovery as such extrinsic, fact-based evidence is
inappropriate for a demurrer. 
Accordingly,
the Court SUSTAINS Demurring Defendants’ Demurrer as to Plaintiff’s eighth
cause of action for medical battery WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.
VI.    
CONCLUSION
Based on
the foregoing analysis, the Court
SUSTAINS Demurring Defendants’ Demurrer as to Plaintiff’s eighth cause of
action for medical battery WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.
Plaintiff
has leave to amend his Complaint on or before September 20, 2024.
          IT
IS SO ORDERED.
DATED: September 4, 2024
