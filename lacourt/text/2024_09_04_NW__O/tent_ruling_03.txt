     CASE NO.: 24VECV02313
 
 
ORDER
  GRANTING DEFENDANT DAN ROSEN, DDS’S, MOTION TO STRIKE
 
 


 I.        INTRODUCTIONThis is a dental
malpractice case arising out of injuries Plaintiff Farah (Farnaz) Ariany
(“Plaintiff”) allegedly suffered while under the care of Dan
Rosen, DDS, a professional corporation, Dan Rosen, DDS (“Defendant”), and
Dennis Smiler, DDS (collectively, “Defendants”).Defendant now
seeks to strike Plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages. II.      PROCEDURAL
HISTORYOn July 3,
2023, Plaintiff filed her Complaint. On May 24,
2024, Plaintiff filed her First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), alleging (1) Dental
Malpractice Negligence. On June 26,
2024, Defendant filed the instant Motion to Strike (“Motion”). On June 28,
2024, Defendant filed his Answer to the FAC.Plaintiff did
not file an Opposition. On August 27,
2024, Defendant filed a Reply.III.     LEGAL
STANDARDThe court may, upon a motion, or at any time in
its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false,
or improper matter inserted in any pleading. (See Code Civ. Proc. §
436(a).)
[1] The court may also strike all or any part of any
pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court
rule, or an order of the court. (See id. at § 436(b).) The grounds for a
motion to strike are that the pleading has irrelevant, false or improper
matter, or has not been drawn or filed in conformity with laws. (See id.
at § 436.) The grounds for moving to strike must appear on the face of the
pleading or by way of judicial notice. (See id. at § 437.)IV.     ANALYSIS  “In any
action for damages arising out of the professional negligence of a health care
provider, no claim for punitive damages¿shall be
included in a complaint or other pleading unless the court enters an order
allowing an amended pleading that includes a claim for punitive damages to be
filed. The court may allow the filing of an amended pleading claiming punitive
damages on a motion by the party seeking the amended pleading and on the basis
of the supporting and opposing affidavits presented that the plaintiff has
established that there is a substantial probability that the plaintiff will
prevail on the claim pursuant to¿Section 3294
of the Civil Code.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 425.13(a).)Defendant
moves to strike Plaintiff’s request for punitive damages in her FAC because
Plaintiff has not obtained leave of court to include such damages pursuant to §
425.13(a). (See Motion, pg. 3.) Plaintiff has
filed a variety of documents with the Court (and the Court will further address
these documents at the hearing on Defendant’s Motion) but none are responsive
to Defendant’s Motion. Two of the documents Plaintiff has filed, however, appear
to at least address Code of Civil Procedure § 425.13(a)’s requirements. These
documents, both filed as a “Declaration,” request this Court allow the
inclusion of punitive damages. (See Pleading to Allow Punitive Damages
filed June 17, 2024, and July 26, 2024.) Plaintiff has not, however, filed this
request as a motion for leave to amend, nor has she scheduled a hearing on the
issue. Accordingly,
because this is a medical negligence action and because this Court has not yet
granted Plaintiff leave to include a claim of punitive damages, the Court
GRANTS Defendant’s Motion to Strike. III.    
CONCLUSIONBased on
the foregoing analysis, the Court GRANTS
Defendant’s Motion to Strike. Plaintiff shall file an amended complaint that
reflects the Court’s ruling on or before September 20, 2024.          IT
IS SO ORDERED.DATED:      September 4, 2024
