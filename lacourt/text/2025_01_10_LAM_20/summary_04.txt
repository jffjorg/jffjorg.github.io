And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendants, HOME 2 U 9, LLC and HOMEIIU, LLC, must produce six documents that they had previously claimed were confidential. The documents in question are related to the care and treatment of Steve Golden, a resident at the defendants' adult residential care facility who had a history of child molestation and was found mentally incompetent during his criminal prosecution. The judge found that the documents are necessary to the administration of justice and may show the defendants' state of knowledge with respect to Golden's propensities. The judge also ruled that the defendants failed to establish with evidence that the documents could not possibly contain the information being sought by the plaintiffs. Additionally, the judge ordered the defendants to provide further responses and production with respect to requests nos. 109-110, which relate to licensing documents that could identify other relevant witnesses. The motion to compel was granted, and the defendants are required to provide the requested documents within 20 days.
