And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is based on the information presented before today. The case is between Plaintiffs Andrea Perez, Byron Arroyo, Antony Perez, and Esteban Lopez against Defendants Lee Tran, Anilkumar Desai, and Krutal Desai. The Plaintiffs filed a complaint against the Defendants for various reasons, including contractual and tortious breach of implied warranty of habitability, statutory violation of warranty of habitability, breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment, nuisance, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence, influencing a wrongful eviction, retaliatory eviction, forcible entry, violation of the Unfair Competition Law, financial abuse of elders and disabled persons, unlawful rent increase, and violation of a resolution of the Board of Supervisors of LA County.

The Defendant, Lee Tran, demurred to the eleventh cause of action, which alleges financial elder abuse. The Judge analyzed the allegations and determined that they adequately state a cause of action for financial elder abuse. The Judge found that the Complaint alleges that the Plaintiffs are dependent adults, that the Defendant retained their rent without remediating substandard conditions, and that this caused monetary harm and emotional distress.

The Judge also found that the Complaint adequately alleges wrongful use, which is one of the elements of financial elder abuse. The Judge noted that the Defendant was aware of the substandard conditions and failed to ensure habitable conditions, which is considered wrongful use.

The Judge overruled the Demurrer and ordered the Defendant to file an answer within 20 days. The Judge also ordered the moving party to give notice.
