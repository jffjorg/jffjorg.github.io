And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on Rafael Castillo's Motion to Quash a deposition subpoena issued by Loomis Armored US, LLC. The subpoena seeks oral testimony and documents related to Castillo's wife, Janet's, income and expenses, as well as the costs of their daughters' quinceaneras. Castillo argues that the subpoena is overly broad and seeks private information. The court finds that while some of the documents are relevant to establishing a motive for conversion, the document requests are too broad and will be narrowed to seek only specific information. The court also declines to apply the marital communications privilege, finding that it only applies to oral or written communications between spouses, and not to physical facts or acts observed. Finally, the court notes that Rafael Castillo has no right to assert the spousal privilege on behalf of his wife, and that the privilege may not apply in this civil case. The Motion to Quash is granted in part, with the subpoena narrowed as described.
