The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Ortiz v. City of Santa Monica, granting the defendant's motion to strike the third cause of action for willful misconduct and prayer for punitive damages. The judge finds that the plaintiff's allegations of drunk driving, even at high speeds, are insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages or willful misconduct. The plaintiff is allowed 15 days to amend their pleadings to provide additional factual support for their claim. The judge's ruling is based on California Civil Code ยง3294(a) and several California appellate court decisions, including Taylor v. Superior Court, Cyrus v. Haveson, and Dawes v. Superior Court.
