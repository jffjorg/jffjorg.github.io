SM 10000 v. Chakchay, Case no. 24SMCV03946
Hearing date November 26, 2024
Defendant’s
Motion to Strike Punitive Damages
Plaintiff
SM 10000 Property, LLC sues defendants Michael Chakchay, Maya Haider and Georgio
Chakchay for unlawful detainer arising from unpaid rent. Defendants move to
strike plaintiff’s prayer for prejudgment interest per Code Civ. Proc. §436. 
“When
the proceeding is for an unlawful detainer after default in the payment of rent…
and, if the lease or agreement is in writing, is for a term of more than one
year, and does not contain a forfeiture clause… a writ shall not be issued to
enforce the judgment until the expiration of 5 days after the entry of the
judgment during which time the tenant… may pay into the court… the amount found
due as rent, with interest thereon, and the amount of the damages found by the
jury or the court for the unlawful detainer, and the costs of the proceedings.”
Code Civ. Proc. §1174(c). Defendant’s response shall be filed within five days,
after service. Code Civ. Proc. §1167(a).
Plaintiff
argues the motion is untimely, as per Cal. Code Civ. Proc §§435(b)(1) and
1167(a), the deadline to file a responsive pleading is 5 days after service.
Defendants Georgio Chakchay and Haider were personally served 9/26/24 and
10/9/24, respectively. Decl. Ishu para. 2; exh. 2. Plaintiff argues defendant
Michael Chakchay was substitute served via on Georgio Chakchay and Haider, so the
latest date to file a responsive pleading was 10/17/24. 
Defendants
filed the MTS 11/1/24 but did not address the issue of timeliness in the motion.
Defendants filed and withdrew a previous demurrer on 10/3/24. As the deadline
to file a responsive pleading to an unlawful detainer complaint is 5 court days
after service, the motion is untimely.
Defendants
argue plaintiff failed to verify the complaint, arguing the signature of Nicole
Brown is insufficient, as plaintiff is a corporation. Plaintiff argues the
complaint is properly verified per H.G. Bittleston Law & Collection
Agency v. Howard (1916) 172 Cal. 357, 156 (holding a plaintiff
corporation’s pleading “might be verified by another than an officer thereof.
The requirement of this section, that an officer of the corporation verify the
pleading, being permissive, and not exclusive.”) Brown is the manager who
signed the lease with defendants, qualifying her to verify the complaint.
Defendants
argue prejudgment interest is unavailable in unlawful detainer cases, citing Hudec
v. Robertson (1989) 210 Cal. App. 3d 1156, 1162. As Hudec was not an
unlawful detainer case based on nonpayment of rent, damages relating to
nonpayment of rent were not available. Id. at 1163. Hudec noted
prejudgment interest is available in unlawful detainer cases for nonpayment of
rent, as here. Id. Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §1164(c) provides for payment of
rent, including interest, as satisfaction of judgment against a non-paying tenant.
Prejudgment interest is available in an unlawful detainer complaint for
nonpayment of rent. The motion is untimely and incorrect as a matter of law.
DENIED.
