Ortiz v. City of Santa Monica, Case
no. 24SMCV02676
Hearing date November 26, 2024
Defendant’s
Motion to Strike Punitive Damages
Plaintiff
Ortiz sues for injuries sustained when defendant Alevizos, who was driving
under the influence, struck him as he waited for a bus. Alevizos moves to
strike the cause of action for willful misconduct and prayer for punitive
damages. 
Punitive
damages are allowable only when plaintiff proves oppression, fraud or malice.
Civ. Code §3294(a). Facts giving rise to a claim for punitive damages must be
pleaded specifically. G.D. Searle & Company v. Superior Court (1975)
49 Cal.App.3d 22, 29. Conclusory requests for punitive damages without factual
support are subject to a motion to strike. E.g., Cyrus v. Haveson
(1976) 65 Cal.App.3d 306, 316-317; Grieves v. Superior Court (1984) 157
Cal.App.3d 159, 164. Recklessness or negligence are insufficient to support an
award of punitive damage. Dawes v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d
82, 88. On a motion to strike, allegations in a pleading must be treated as
true. E.g., Clauson v. Sup. Ct. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1253, 1255.
Defendant
Alevizos argues plaintiff fails to plead facts sufficient to state a claim for
punitive damages, as Taylor v. Superior Court (1979) 24 Cal.3d 890, holds
punitive damages are not available in drunk driving cases absent despicable behavior.
Alevizos argues despicable behavior means behavior “so vile, base,
contemptible, miserable, wretched or loathsome that it would be looked down
upon and despised by ordinary decent people,” not merely reckless or willful
behavior. See, e.g., Lackner v. North (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 1188. Defendant
argues plaintiff simply alleged Alevizos became willfully intoxicated and chose
to drive. See Compl. paras. 42-44.  Allegations
of drunk driving, even at high speeds, absent additional reckless behaviors,
such as racing, are not sufficient to claim punitive damages. See Dawes,
supra, at 90.
Plaintiff
argues defendant Alevizos’ actions constitute malicious behavior sufficient to
support a claim for punitive damages, as his actions are analogous to those of
defendant in Taylor, supra, wherein defendant was liable for
punitive damages. Defendant in Taylor was alleged to have been an
alcoholic with a habit of drunk driving, which the court found sufficient to
infer malice. Plaintiff here makes no such allegations against Alevizos; mere
allegations of drunk driving, even at high speeds, are insufficient to support
a claim for punitive damages or willful misconduct.
Plaintiff
seeks leave to amend. Defendant Alevizos’ motion to strike the third cause of
action for willful misconduct and prayer for punitive damages is GRANTED with
15 days leave to amend.
