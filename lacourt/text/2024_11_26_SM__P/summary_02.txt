And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motion to strike punitive damages is untimely and incorrect as a matter of law. The defendant filed the motion on November 1, 2024, but the deadline to file a responsive pleading to an unlawful detainer complaint is 5 court days after service, which was October 17, 2024. The judge also found that the plaintiff's complaint is properly verified, as the signature of Nicole Brown, the manager of the plaintiff corporation, is sufficient to verify the complaint.

The judge further ruled that prejudgment interest is available in unlawful detainer cases for nonpayment of rent, citing California Code of Civil Procedure §1164(c). Therefore, the motion to strike punitive damages is denied.
