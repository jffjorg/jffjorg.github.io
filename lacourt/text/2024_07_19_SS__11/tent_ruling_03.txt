Concepcion does not change the result. 
The issue there was whether the FAA preempts California’s rule barring
class-arbitration waivers.  It is off
point.

Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America v. Bonta (9th
Cir. 2023) 62 F.4th 473 (“Bonta”) is unhelpful as well.  (See Motion, pp. 2-3.)  Labor Code section 432.6 “prohibits
California employers from requiring prospective and current employees to ‘waive
any right, forum, or procedure’ for any violation of the FEHA or California
Labor Code, and provides for civil and criminal penalties.”  (Knight, supra, at ¶ 5:76.25a.)  The Bonta court found that the FAA
preempts section 432.6.  (See Bonta,
supra, 62 F.4th at 478, 484-490.) 
The decision does not address section SB 365’s elimination of the automatic
stay.

Defendant unpersuasively references Code of Civil Procedure section 916.  (See Motion, pp. 1, 6, 7.)  SB 365’s new rule applies “[n]otwithstanding
Section 916[.]”  (Id. at § 1294, subd.
(a).)
