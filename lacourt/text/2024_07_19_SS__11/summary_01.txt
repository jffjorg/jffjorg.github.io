And here is a brief English text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied a motion by Liberty Property LP and Prologis, Inc. to bifurcate two issues for a bench trial in a case related to a warehouse fire that caused hazardous materials to enter the Dominguez Channel. The motion sought to separate the control issue (who had control over the warehouse tenants) from the discharge issue (whether the fire department's actions were liable for the discharge of emergency fire suppression water). The judge agreed with the opposition, citing that bifurcation would not promote the ends of justice or economy, and would instead cause inefficiencies and waste. The judge also disagreed with the moving parties' reliance on the "equity first" rule, as the control and discharge issues apply to both legal and equitable claims. The motion was denied without prejudice, allowing the parties to refile it following summary judgment/adjudication.
