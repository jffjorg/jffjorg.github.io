[1] Plaintiff’s argument – that Defendant
did not explain the agreement to him – is unpersuasive.  Plaintiff fails to declare that he requested
an explanation or that he failed to receive opportunities to read the agreement
and to consult attorneys before signing. 
(See Davis Decl., ¶¶ 4-7.)  To
repeat, failure to read is not a defense.


[2]
Plaintiff unpersuasively argues that the agreement’s delegation clause is
unconscionable.  (See Opposition, pp.
6-7.)  One, the fact that the underlying
agreement is an adhesion contract is not enough to establish procedural
unconscionability. Two, Plaintiff only discusses the procedural element of
unconscionability as to the delegation clause and does not address or establish
the substantive element.


[3] Plaintiff asserts that Viking River is
distinguishable.  He contends Defendant’s
agreement does not have a PAGA waiver and severability clause.  (See Opposition, pp. 9-10.)
 
The
Court disagrees with Plaintiff.  The
agreement prohibits representative arbitration, which necessarily includes
arbitration of representative PAGA claims, and requires “unlawful, invalid, or
unenforceable” provisions to be “severed[.]” 
(Elzarad Decl., Ex. 2.)
