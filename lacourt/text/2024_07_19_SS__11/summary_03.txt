And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that Concepcion does not change the outcome of the case, and Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America v. Bonta (9th Cir. 2023) 62 F.4th 473 ("Bonta") is also not relevant. The Judge notes that Labor Code section 432.6 prohibits California employers from requiring employees to waive rights, forums, or procedures for FEHA or California Labor Code violations, and that the FAA preempts this section. The Judge also points out that SB 365 eliminates the automatic stay, and that the Bonta court did not address this elimination in its decision. Finally, the Judge notes that the defendant's reference to Code of Civil Procedure section 916 is unpersuasive, as SB 365's new rule applies notwithstanding this section.
