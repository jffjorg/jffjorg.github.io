And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Touchstone Golf, LLC, has moved to stay the case while it appeals the denial of its motion to compel arbitration. The court has denied the motion, finding that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) does not apply to this case since the court previously found that an agreement to arbitrate does not exist. The court also found that the new rule eliminating the automatic stay for appeals of orders denying petitions to compel arbitration does not conflict with the purposes and objectives of the FAA. The court believes that denying the stay request will not create an obstacle to the FAA's purposes and objectives, and that the parties will simply proceed with discovery, which they have a right to do regardless of whether the case proceeds in court or in arbitration. The court also found that a discretionary stay would thwart the Legislature's stated purpose for amending the relevant statute, which was to prevent corporations from using a common delay tactic against workers.
