And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses the arguments presented by the plaintiff and defendant in a court case. The plaintiff argues that the defendant did not explain the agreement to him, but the judge finds this argument unpersuasive, as the plaintiff does not declare that he requested an explanation or that he was not given opportunities to read and consult with attorneys before signing. The judge also rejects the plaintiff's argument that the agreement's delegation clause is unconscionable, finding that the fact that the agreement is an adhesion contract is not enough to establish procedural unconscionability, and that the plaintiff only discusses the procedural element of unconscionability without addressing the substantive element.

Additionally, the judge disagrees with the plaintiff's assertion that the case Viking River is distinguishable, finding that the agreement in question prohibits representative arbitration and has a severability clause, similar to the agreement in Viking River. The judge's ruling sets the stage for a future court hearing, where the parties will have the opportunity to present further evidence and arguments.
