TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendant’s motion
to stay is denied.
 
BACKGROUND
 
Touchstone is a company that manages golf courses.  Plaintiff used to work for Touchstone.  He contends Touchstone subjected him and
other current and former employees to numerous wage-and-hour violations.
 
On May 23, 3024, the Court denied Touchstone’s motion to compel
arbitration.
 
Here, Touchstone moves to stay the case while it appeals the denial.
 
DISCUSSION
 
“Through December 31, 2023, an appeal from an order
denying a petition to compel arbitration automatically stayed all further trial
court proceedings in the case.” 
(Eisenberg, et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Civ. Appeals and Writs (The
Rutter Group December 2023 Update) ¶ 7:91.6, emphasis in original.) However,
“effective January 1, 2024, the automatic stay is eliminated[.]”
(Ibid., emphasis in original.)
 
Senate Bill (“SB”) 365 is the
bill that added this new rule to Code of Civil Procedure section 1294. (See https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB365;
see also Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 1294, subd. (a) [stating that “the perfecting
of [] an appeal” of “[a]n order dismissing or denying a petition to compel
arbitration” “shall not automatically stay any proceedings in the trial court
during the pendency of the appeal”].)  
 
Defendant contends the motion to
stay should be granted because the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs and
preempts SB 365.  As a result, Defendant
asserts that Plaintiff’s case is automatically stayed until the appeal is
finished.  (See Motion, pp. 2-8 [citing AT&T
Mobility LLC v. Concepcion (2011) 563 U.S. 333 and Coinbase, Inc. v.
Bielski (2023) 599 U.S. 736 (“Coinbase”)].)
 
Plaintiff claims the FAA does not
apply since the Court found that an agreement to arbitrate does not exist.  He also claims Defendant’s preemption
argument should be rejected because the new rule does not conflict with the
FAA’s purposes and objectives.  (See
Opposition, pp. 2-5 [stating that “an automatic stay would be contrary” to the
Legislature’s intentions in amending section 1294], emphasis deleted.)
 
Even assuming the
FAA applies, the Court agrees with Plaintiff. 
Coinbase analyzes section 16(a) of the FAA.  The decision holds that court litigation must
be stayed while an appeal of an order denying a motion to compel arbitration
takes place.  (See Coinbase,
supra, 599 U.S. at 738.)  But Coinbase
is only applicable when a federal district court denies an arbitration motion;
it does not apply to decisions by state courts. 
(See Knight, et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Alternative Dispute Resolution
(The Rutter Group December 2023 Update) ¶ 5:338.2.)  Indeed, “section 16 . . . is not binding on
our state court proceedings[.]” (Muao v. Grosvenor Properties (2002) 99
Cal.App.4th 1085, 1092 [analyzing section 16(a)(3)].)  Moreover, denying the stay request will not
create an obstacle to the FAA’s purposes and objectives, especially given that “[t]he
parties will simply be proceeding with discovery,” which they “have a right to
[do] whether this case proceeds in court or in arbitration.”  (Opposition, p. 6.)  For these reasons, the preemption argument
fails, and the request for an automatic stay is denied.[1] [2] [3]
 
The request for a
discretionary stay is also denied.  The
Court believes a discretionary stay would thwart the Legislature’s stated
purpose for amending section 1294, which was to “prevent corporations from
using a common delay tactic against workers[.]” (Opposition, p. 5 [quoting
legislative history].)  And, again,
“[t]he parties will simply be proceeding with discovery,” so there is no
conflict.
