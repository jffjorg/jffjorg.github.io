LEGAL STANDARD
 
“Upon the filing of the complaint or at any time thereafter, the

a written application for the writ with the court in which the action is
brought.” (Code Civ. Proc. section 512.010, subd. (a).) 
 
“The application shall be executed
under oath and shall include all of the following: [¶] (1) A showing of the basis of the
plaintiff’s claim and that the plaintiff is entitled to possession of the
property claimed. If the basis of the plaintiff’s claim is a written
instrument, a copy of the instrument shall be attached. [¶] (2) A showing that the
property is wrongfully detained by the defendant, of the manner in which the
defendant came into possession of the property, and, according to the best
knowledge, information, and belief of the plaintiff, of the reason for the
detention. [¶] (3) A
particular description of the property and a statement of its value. [¶] (4) A statement,
according to the best knowledge, information, and belief of the plaintiff, of
the location of the property and, if the property, or some part of it, is
within a private place which may have to be entered to take possession, a showing
that there is probable cause to believe that such property is located there. [¶] (5) A statement that the
property has not been taken for a tax, assessment, or fine, pursuant to a
statute; or seized under an execution against the property of the plaintiff;
or, if so seized, that it is by statute exempt from such seizure.” (Code Civ.

DISCUSSION
 
Requirements of Code of Civil Procedure Section 512.010 
 
Plaintiff filed an application for writ of
possession for a 2018 Freightliner Cascadia, Vehicle Identification number 3AKJHHDR9JSJS3104
(“Subject Vehicle”). 
 
Plaintiff provides that its
assignor, Tandem Finance Inc. entered into an agreement with Defendant Cabanas
Transport Inc. for the Subject Vehicle. (Fitzgerald Decl. ¶ 4, Exhibit 1.) Cabanas had agreed to pay
$3,292.79 each month. (Id. ¶ 5.) Plaintiff provides that Cabanas failed
to make monthly payments starting on June 28, 2023. (Id. ¶ 8.) Plaintiff provides that Cabanas owes $172,881.81. (Id ¶
9.) Plaintiff provides that the subject vehicle is worth between $30,000.00 to
$45.000. (Id. ¶ 22.) Plaintiff provides that the vehicle is located at 1337
North Alvarado Street, Los Angeles, California 90026 or 704 East Angeleno
Avenue, San Gabriel, California 91776. (Id. ¶ 17.) Plaintiff also provides that the property has not been
taken for a tax, assessment, or fine nor has it been seized under execution
against Plaintiff’s property. (Id ¶ 20.)
 
            Plaintiff has complied with the requirements of Code of
Civil Procedure section 512.010. 
 
Issues at Hearing
 
            “At the hearing, a writ of
possession shall issue if both of the following are found: [¶] (1) The plaintiff has
established the probable validity of the plaintiff’s claim to possession of the
property. [¶] (2) The
undertaking requirements of Section 515.010 are satisfied.” (Code Civ. Proc.
section 512.060.)
 
            “If the court finds that the defendant has no interest in the property,
the court shall waive the requirement of the plaintiff's undertaking and shall
include in the order for issuance of the writ the amount of the defendant's
undertaking sufficient to satisfy the requirements of subdivision (b) of Section 515.020.” (Code Civ. Proc. section 515.010,
subd. (b).) 
 
            The court
finds that the declaration and attached exhibits filed by Kenny Fitzgerald
demonstrate probably validity of its claims of possession and its
compliance with the undertaking requirement of section 515.010.
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Plaintiff’s
application for writ of possession is tentatively GRANTED.
