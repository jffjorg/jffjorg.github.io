Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in plain English:

The judge has rejected Nissan North America's motion to compel arbitration and stay the action. The judge believes that the arbitration agreement in the Retail Installment Sale Contract is not enforceable against the Plaintiff. The judge also believes that Nissan North America is not entitled to enforce the arbitration agreement against the Plaintiff because the Plaintiff's claims are based on the manufacturer's warranty, not the sale contract. The judge has not considered the merits of the Plaintiff's claims, but rather has focused on the procedural issue of whether the arbitration agreement is enforceable.
