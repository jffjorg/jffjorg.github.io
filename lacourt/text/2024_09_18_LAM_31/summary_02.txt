Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion to compel further responses to discovery in a Song-Beverly action. The plaintiff, William Robert Fonseca, alleged that General Motors, LLC (GM) violated California's Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act by failing to repair a 2020 Silverado 1500 vehicle and its various defects, including the Powertrain Defect. GM objected to the requests for production of documents, citing vagueness, ambiguity, and overbreadth. The judge granted the motion in part, ordering GM to provide further responses and documents to requests for production of documents (RFP) Nos. 16-19. However, the judge denied the motion to compel further responses to RFP Nos. 20-21, finding that the terms "failure rates" and "fixes" were vague and overbroad.
