```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for alternative service, which sought to serve defendant Ion Theodor Ciochiu via Facebook Messenger. The judge found that the Hague Convention, which governs international service of process, applies to this case and requires that service be made in accordance with Romanian law. The judge also found that Ion has not made a general appearance in the action, as he has only objected to the lack of personal jurisdiction over him and has not sought any affirmative relief on the merits. Therefore, alternative service cannot be granted. The judge notes that Ion's declaration in support of Wynn's motion to quash does not constitute a general appearance, as it only objects to the lack of personal jurisdiction and does not seek any affirmative relief.
