And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge, Kerry Bensinger, has issued a tentative ruling on a motion by the plaintiffs to extend the five-year deadline to bring the case to trial. The plaintiffs, who are former sheriff deputies, are seeking to extend the deadline due to the pending long cause assignment, which has not yet been issued. The County of Los Angeles, the defendant, opposes the motion, arguing that there is still sufficient time to obtain the assignment and complete trial before the deadline. The Judge has continued the hearing for three months, to December 18, 2024, pending the outcome of the long cause assignment.
