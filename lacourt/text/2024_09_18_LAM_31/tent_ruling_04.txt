CASE:                         Maria Botham, et al. v. Farmers Insurance Exchange
 
CASE NO.:                 24STCP01962
 





















 
PETITION
FOR AN ORDER COMPELLING UNDERINSURED MOTORIST ARBITRATION (C.C.P. § 1281.2)


 
MOVING PARTY:               Petitioners
Maria Botham, et al.
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Respondent Farmers
Insurance Exchange
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
 
On
June 10,2021, a vehicle driven by Daniel Ibrahim Lazarnejad (Lazarnejad)
collided into the home of Maria Botham (Maria), Georgia Botham (Georgia), and
Lucia Botham (Lucia). The vehicle caught fire and exploded.  Lazarnejad died as a result of his injuries.  Maria, Georgia, and Lucia were at the house
at the time of the incident.  
 
As
relevant here, Maria, Georgia, and Lucia (collectively, Petitioners) submitted
an underinsured motorist (UIM) claim to their insurer, Farmers Insurance
Exchange (Respondent), to recover for emotional distress damages.  Respondent denied coverage.  
 
On
May 15, 2024, Respondent filed a declaratory relief action in Case No.
24STCV12267.  Respondent seeks a
declaration that Petitioner’ auto policy did not provide coverage for
Petitioners’ injuries.
 
On
June 18, 2024, Petitioners filed this Petition for an Order Compelling
Underinsured Motorist Arbitration in this court.  
 
Respondent
filed an opposition.  Petitioners
replied.
 
II.        DISCUSSION
 
            Respondent opposes the instant Petition based partly
on the ground it has initiated a declaratory relief action in Case No.
24STCV12267.  As Respondent explains, the
declaratory relief action will determine whether Petitioners are entitled to
UIM coverage or whether the coverage dispute must be arbitrated.
 
            The
court notes this case and Case No. 24STCV12267 appear to arise from the same dispute.  Case No. 24STCV12267, which is pending before
Department 26, is the lower numbered case. 
However, the parties have not filed a Notice of Related Case.  The parties are directed to file notice.  The court will continue the hearing for this
petition to allow Department 26 to consider whether these actions are related.
 
III.        CONCLUSION
            
             The petition
is CONTINUED to October 21, 2024 at 8:30 AM.
  
Clerk of the court to give notice.  
 
 
Dated:   September 18,
2024
