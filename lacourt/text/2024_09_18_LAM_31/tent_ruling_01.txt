DATE:  Not set
                                                           
CASE:                         Art Hernandez, et al. v. County of Los Angeles, et al.
 
CASE NO.:                 19STCV33158
 





















 
PLAINTIFFS’
MOTION TO EXTEND TRIAL PAST FIVE YEARS



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiffs
Art Hernandez, et al.
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendant County
of Los Angeles
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
 
In this action, several sheriff deputies who were formerly
assigned to the East L.A. station allege they were pressured to quit their jobs
or leave the station and were otherwise harassed by other deputies who are
alleged members of a gang known as the Banditos. They allege discrimination,
harassment, retaliation, and related claims against Defendant County of Los
Angeles (“County”) and allege assault, battery, and other claims against
Defendants Rafael “Rene” Munoz, Gregory Rodriguez, David Silverio, and Michael
Hernandez (collectively “Individual Defendants”).  
 
On September 18, 2019, Plaintiffs filed a Complaint.  
            
            On November
29, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Long Cause Trial. 
 
On May 13, 2023, Department 1 accepted Plaintiffs’ long
cause submission.
 
On June 25, 2024, the parties represented to the court that
an assignment had not been issued.  The
assignment is still pending. 
 
            Plaintiffs
now move for an order extending the five-year deadline.
 
            The County
filed an opposition.  Plaintiffs replied.

 
            The
deadline to bring this case to trial is March 18, 2025.
 
II.        DISCUSSION
 
            Plaintiffs argue an emergency now exists to extend
the five year deadline to bring this case to trial.  Department 1 has yet to assign this case to a
long cause courtroom.  The County refuses
to stipulate to a trial date extension.
 
            The
County contends the motion is premature. 
As the County points out, there are still six months remaining, which is
sufficient time to obtain a court assignment and complete trial.  
 
            The
court is aware of the pending long cause assignment.  There is time left on the clock for the
assignment.  Accordingly, the hearing for
this motion is continued for three months.
 
III.        CONCLUSION
            
             The
motion is CONTINUED to December 18, 2024 at 8:30 AM.
  
Clerk of the court to give notice.  
 
 
Dated:   September 18,
2024
