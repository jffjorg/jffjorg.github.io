And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the evidence presented and has decided to deny the plaintiff's motion to compel cross-defendant Michelle Pascual to respond to form interrogatories. While Pascual concedes that her responses were untimely, the court finds that her counsel did not receive the interrogatories when they were served, and therefore, Pascual acted with substantial justification. The court also notes that the plaintiff did not meet and confer regarding certain interrogatories, which may have avoided the need for this motion. As a result, the court exercises its discretion not to impose sanctions against Pascual or her counsel.
