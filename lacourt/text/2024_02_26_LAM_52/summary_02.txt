And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Cross-complainant Tywon White's motion to compel non-party Sunlight Financial, LLC to comply with a deposition subpoena for production of business records. White's motion was untimely, as it was filed 10 days after the deadline specified in the statute. The judge ruled that the 60-day period to file a motion to compel began on the date specified for production in the subpoena, not on the date when the production was completed. The court also rejected White's argument that the meet and confer process extended the deadline for filing the motion. As a result, Sunlight Financial, LLC's motion to quash the deposition subpoena is moot.
