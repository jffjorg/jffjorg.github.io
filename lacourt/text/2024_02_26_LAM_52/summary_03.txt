And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has granted plaintiff Neda Alhilali's motion for trial preference under Code of Civil Procedure section 36(a). As the sole plaintiff and at the age of 85, Alhilali has a substantial interest in the action and her health problems necessitate trial preference to prevent prejudicing her interest. Despite defendants' opposition, the court finds that granting trial preference will serve the interests of justice. The trial will be set within 120 days, and a final status conference will be held on May 20, 2024, at 9:00 a.m., followed by the trial on June 5, 2024, at 10:00 a.m.
