And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the complaint. The plaintiff had filed a complaint alleging various causes of action against the defendant, but discovery had uncovered new facts that would allow the plaintiff to augment and expand their allegations against the defendant. The plaintiff sought to add new allegations and claims, including a claim for punitive damages.

The defendant opposed the motion, arguing that the Notice of Motion was deficient and that the amendment would prejudice them. The defendant also argued that the plaintiff had failed to show sufficient evidence to justify the exercise of the court's discretionary power.

The judge found that the plaintiff's motion was procedurally sufficient and that the plaintiff had provided legally sufficient evidence to support the court's discretionary power to grant leave to amend. The judge also found that the defendant would not be prejudiced by the amendment, as the trial is not set for several months and the plaintiff is open to allowing additional discovery.

The judge also denied the defendant's request to shift all or most of the new discovery costs to the plaintiff, as there has been no postponement of the trial.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling suggests that the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the complaint has been granted, and that the amendment will allow the plaintiff to add new allegations and claims, including a claim for punitive damages.
