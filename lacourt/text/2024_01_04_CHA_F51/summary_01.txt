  - "Punitive damages may be recovered in actions not arising from breach of contract, upon a proper showing of malice, fraud, or oppression by clear and convincing evidence."

Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer with a motion to strike filed by Defendant State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company against Plaintiff Larry Brent. The demurrer is sustained, and the motion to strike is granted. The Plaintiff is granted 30 days to amend the complaint to cure the defects. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's complaint lacks factual allegations to support his claims for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, declaratory relief, and punitive damages. The Plaintiff's claim for breach of contract is the only viable cause of action, and punitive damages are not recoverable in this case.
