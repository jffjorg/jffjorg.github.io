And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's prayer for attorneys' fees. The plaintiff, Reza Safaie, entered into an agreement with the defendants to serve as a third-party payor of attorneys' fees for their client, Fair Ocean Management LLC. However, the plaintiff refused to pay the invoices submitted by the defendants, claiming that the services and expenses were "unconscionable and unreasonable." The defendants advised the plaintiff that he did not have the legal right to terminate or cancel the agreement, and that they would seek attorneys' fees once the case was over.

The plaintiff alleges that the defendants' advice converted their relationship into one of attorney and client, and that the defendants committed malpractice and fraud. The plaintiff also seeks to strike portions of the first amended complaint, but the judge has already ruled that the plaintiff cannot seek attorneys' fees without specifying a statutory or contractual basis for the fee request.

The judge finds that the plaintiff's continued request for attorneys' fees is duplicative of the request for compensatory damages and is not supported by the allegations in the complaint. Therefore, the judge grants the defendant's motion to strike the prayer for attorneys' fees without leave to amend.
