And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by defendant Ruzanna Khetchian to the second amended complaint filed by plaintiff Elmira Apreian. The case involves a slip and fall accident on a sidewalk in West Hollywood, and plaintiff claims that defendants Los Angeles County Development Authority (LACDA) and Khetchian are liable for her injuries. Khetchian argues that she is immune from liability as a public employee, and that plaintiff has failed to plead sufficient facts to support a negligence claim. The Court agrees with Khetchian that plaintiff has failed to plead how she was negligent, and sustains the demurrer to the negligence claim with 20 days' leave to amend. The Court also agrees with Khetchian that plaintiff cannot plead a valid claim for dangerous condition of public property against an individual, and sustains the demurrer to that claim without leave to amend.
