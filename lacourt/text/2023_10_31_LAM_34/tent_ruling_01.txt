On October 28, 2022, Plaintiffs Phillys Johnson and Raul Salas filed
their Complaint against Defendants Home Matters USA, Southwest Consulting
Enterprises, Inc., and Roger S. Dyer on causes of action for breach of
contract, fraud, and unjust enrichment. 
 
On June 30, 2023, by request of Plaintiffs, the Clerk’s Office entered
default on Defendants Home Matters USA and Roger S. Dyer. 
 
On July 20, 2023, by request of Plaintiffs, the Clerk’s Office entered
default on Defendant Southwest Consulting Enterprises, Inc. 
 
On August 2, 2023, Plaintiffs filed Judicial Council Form JUD-100,
Proposed Judgment. 
 
On September 11, 2023, the Court denied Plaintiff’s Request for Entry
of Default Judgement because she had not filed the required documents. 
 
II.      
ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiffs’ counsel has been
derelict in litigating this action.  On
October 28, 2022, The Sands Law Group filed this case on behalf of Plaintiff.
 
        At the first
Case Management Conference on March 1, 2023, counsel stated that they had just
served defendants and requested that the CMC be continued 60 days. The Court
continued the CMC, ordered that all parties to file a new, timely CMS prior to
continued CMC. 
 
        No Proof of
Service or Case Management Statement was filed prior to the continued CMC on
April 17, 2023.  In fact, contradicting
their previous statement on March 1, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel stated on April
17th that they had been unable to serve the defendants and that they might be
dismissing the case.  The Court continued
the CMC, and again ordered that all parties to file a new, timely CMS prior to
next CMC.  The Court further stated that
if there was no service prior to the next CMC, the Court would dismiss the
case.  The CMC was continued to June 16,
2023.
 
At the June 16th CMC,
Plaintiff’s counsel informed the Court – contrary to its previous two
representations to the Court – that Defendants had actually been served on
December 22, 2022.  The Court imposed
sanctions of $250 against Plaintiff’s counsel for failure to timely file the
Case Management Statements and Proofs of Service.  The CMC and/or OSC re Entry of Default was
continued to July 7, 2023.
 
On July 7, 2023, the CMC and/or OSC
re Entry of Default was again continued to August 10, 2023.
 
Default against the final defendant
was finally entered on July 20, 2023. 
The Court set an OSC re Entry of Default Judgement for today’s date.
 
On September 11, 2023, the Court denied Entry of Default Judgement because
plaintiff failed to file the required documents. The Court continued the
OSC re Entry of Default Judgement until today’s hearing.  The Court further stated that “[i]f default
is not entered by that date, the Court will dismiss the action.”  (See 9/11/23 Minute Order.)
 
No further documents have been
filed since the last hearing.

The case is dismissed.
