And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the case is dismissed. The judge finds that the plaintiff's counsel has been derelict in litigating the action and has failed to timely file required documents. The court previously denied entry of default judgment on September 11, 2023, and warned that if default is not entered by a certain date, the court would dismiss the action. Since no further documents have been filed, the judge has decided to dismiss the case.
