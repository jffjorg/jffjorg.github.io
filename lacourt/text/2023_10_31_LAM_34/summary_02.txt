```

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the motion to compel arbitration brought by Vio's Auto Sales Inc. The arbitration agreement is procedurally unconscionable because it is a contract of adhesion, and the parties did not have meaningful choice in negotiating the terms of the agreement. Additionally, the agreement is substantively unconscionable because it requires the consumer to arbitrate with AAA, which does not provide a right to conduct discovery, and limits the payment of arbitral fees to $5,000. The judge also notes that there is judicial economy in litigating all three defendants together, and denying the motion to compel arbitration will not prejudice the parties.
