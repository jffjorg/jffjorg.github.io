And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to supplement the administrative record in a case involving a dispute over a photograph of a custodial daughter. The petitioner, Earnest A. Davis, seeks to add the photograph to the record, which he claims is missing. The respondent, Los Angeles County Child Support Services, did not oppose the motion, but failed to provide proof of service of the motion. The judge notes that the respondent's non-opposition and response to the motion was filed extremely late, but will consider it nonetheless. The judge conditionsally grants the motion, subject to the petitioner filing and serving a proposed order that includes the material he seeks to add to the record. If the respondent does not object to the proposed order within 10 days, the judge will sign it.
