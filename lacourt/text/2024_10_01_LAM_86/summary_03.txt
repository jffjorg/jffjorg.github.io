And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's application for a writ of possession, allowing them to take possession of the 2019 Mercedes-Benz E300 motor vehicle. The plaintiff is the assignee of a Retail Installment Sales Contract (RISC) with the defendant, Marshon Burgess, who has defaulted on the contract. The defendant, EM & VR Corporation dba A1 Smog and Repair (A1 Smog), has claimed a lien on the vehicle for storage and repair fees, but the judge finds that their lien has been extinguished due to their untimely application for authorization.

The judge concludes that the plaintiff is entitled to an order for writ of possession and a turnover order under CCP § 512.070. The plaintiff must post an undertaking in the amount of $51,000, while A1 Smog must post an undertaking in the amount of $26,000, equal to the current market value of the vehicle.
