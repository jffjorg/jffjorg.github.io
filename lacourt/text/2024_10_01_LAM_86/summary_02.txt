And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel compliance with a subpoena served on Pessah Law Group, PC. The subpoena seeks documents related to Ikspan, Inc.'s lawsuit, including settlement agreements, documents reflecting payment of settlement funds, and communications between Ikspan and its counsel. The judge finds that the requested documents are relevant to the instant litigation and that the plaintiff's right to discovery outweighs Ikspan's right to financial privacy.

The judge also orders Pessah Law Group, PC to serve a privilege log to identify any documents that are protected by attorney-client privilege or work product doctrine. The judge declines to impose monetary sanctions on Pessah Law Group, PC, finding that the firm had substantial justification to object to the subpoena and that the plaintiff's baseless assertion of the crime-fraud exception was insufficient to pierce any privilege.

The judge orders Pessah Law Group, PC to comply with the subpoena within 15 days.
