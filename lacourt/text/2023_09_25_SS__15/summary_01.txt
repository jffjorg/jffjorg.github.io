And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made several rulings on motions in limine filed by both parties. The judge has granted several of the defendants' motions, including the exclusion of evidence about diseases caused by talc other than mesothelioma, references to other lawsuits involving Johnson & Johnson, and statements about concealment. The judge has also granted several of the plaintiffs' motions, including the exclusion of evidence of insurance coverage, settlements or other collateral source benefits, and evidence of talc pleurodesis.

The judge has denied several motions without prejudice to objections at trial, including motions to exclude evidence about foreign governmental investigations, a paper authored by Teresa Emory, John Maddox, and Richard Kradin, and an article written by Dr. Jacqueline Moline.

The judge has also ruled that an expert may rely on hearsay and tell the jury generally that he or she relied on the hearsay. The judge has noted that the admissibility of certain evidence will depend on the expert's testimony at trial.

The judge has denied one motion in limine, filed by Johnson & Johnson, which sought an order that witnesses, documents, and demonstratives be disclosed. The judge has noted that this is not a proper motion in limine and that the trial court will have its own rules for trial procedure.

The judge has granted one motion to exclude evidence, filed by Johnson & Johnson, which sought to exclude references to the LTL Management bankruptcy proceedings.
