The judge has made several rulings on motions in limine filed by both parties. The judge has granted several of the defendants' motions, including the exclusion of evidence about diseases caused by talc other than mesothelioma, references to other lawsuits involving Johnson & Johnson, and statements about concealment. The judge has also granted several of the plaintiffs' motions, including the exclusion of evidence of insurance coverage, settlements or other collateral source benefits, and evidence of talc pleurodesis.

The judge has denied several motions without prejudice to objections at trial, including motions to exclude evidence about foreign governmental investigations, a paper authored by Teresa Emory, John Maddox, and Richard Kradin, and an article written by Dr. Jacqueline Moline.

The judge has also ruled that an expert may rely on hearsay and tell the jury generally that he or she relied on the hearsay. The judge has noted that the admissibility of certain evidence will depend on the expert's testimony at trial.

The judge has denied one motion in limine, filed by Johnson & Johnson, which sought an order that witnesses, documents, and demonstratives be disclosed. The judge has noted that this is not a proper motion in limine and that the trial court will have its own rules for trial procedure.

The judge has granted one motion to exclude evidence, filed by Johnson & Johnson, which sought to exclude references to the LTL Management bankruptcy proceedings.

## Case Number: 21STCV23555  Hearing Date: September 25, 2023  Dept: 15 

This document is a tentative ruling by a Judge on various motions in limine (MIL) filed by both the Plaintiffs and the Defendants.  

**Parties:**

* **Plaintiffs:**  (Names not provided in the document)
* **Defendants:** 
    * Charles B. Chrystal Company
    * Johnson & Johnson

**Key Issues:**

The Judge is considering whether certain evidence should be allowed or disallowed at trial.  The main disputes center around:

* **Insurance and Settlements:** Plaintiffs want to exclude evidence of insurance coverage, settlements, or other collateral source benefits.  The Judge mostly grants this request, except for information about the actual amount paid for medical bills.
* **Expert Testimony:**  The Judge addresses several motions regarding the admissibility of testimony from expert Barry Horn.  His testimony is partially allowed, but only if specific conditions are met.
* **Genetic Cause of Mesothelioma:** The Judge denies a motion to exclude evidence about a speculative genetic cause of mesothelioma because it is too vague.  
* **Talc Pleurodesis:** The Judge denies a motion to exclude evidence about the medical procedure called talc pleurodesis, but leaves the door open for objections at trial depending on the Plaintiff's testimony.
* **Asbestos Definitions and Cleavage Fragments:** The Judge denies a motion to exclude evidence about asbestos definitions and cleavage fragments, finding it to be a disputed issue that needs to be decided at trial.
* **Evidence of Talc Products:**  The Judge rules on several motions related to evidence about the Defendants' talc products, including:
    * Granting a motion to exclude evidence of talc-based baby powder sales.
    * Denying a motion to exclude evidence about the discontinuation of sales.
    * Ruling on the admissibility of certain media articles.
* **Foreign Governmental Investigations:**  The Judge grants a motion to exclude evidence about foreign governmental investigations and proceedings into talc.

**Overall:**

This tentative ruling reflects the Judge's preliminary thoughts on the admissible evidence in this case.  It is important to note that this is not a final decision.  Further arguments and objections can be made at the trial hearing.
