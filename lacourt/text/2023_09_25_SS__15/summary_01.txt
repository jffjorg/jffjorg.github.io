And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made several rulings on motions in limine filed by both parties. The judge has granted several of the defendants' motions, including the exclusion of evidence about diseases caused by talc other than mesothelioma, references to other lawsuits involving Johnson & Johnson, and statements about concealment. The judge has also granted several of the plaintiffs' motions, including the exclusion of evidence of insurance coverage, settlements or other collateral source benefits, and evidence of talc pleurodesis.

The judge has denied several motions without prejudice to objections at trial, including motions to exclude evidence about foreign governmental investigations, a paper authored by Teresa Emory, John Maddox, and Richard Kradin, and an article written by Dr. Jacqueline Moline.

The judge has also ruled that an expert may rely on hearsay and tell the jury generally that he or she relied on the hearsay. The judge has noted that the admissibility of certain evidence will depend on the expert's testimony at trial.

The judge has denied one motion in limine, filed by Johnson & Johnson, which sought an order that witnesses, documents, and demonstratives be disclosed. The judge has noted that this is not a proper motion in limine and that the trial court will have its own rules for trial procedure.

The judge has granted one motion to exclude evidence, filed by Johnson & Johnson, which sought to exclude references to the LTL Management bankruptcy proceedings.

## Tentative Ruling Summary: Case 21STCV23555

**Parties Involved:**

* **Plaintiffs:** Not specified in the document.
* **Defendants:** Charles B. Chrystal Company, Johnson & Johnson

**Dates:**

* **Hearing Date:** September 25, 2023
* **CMO:** July 8, 2022

**Issues:**

The Judge is considering various motions in limine (MIL) filed by both Plaintiffs and Defendants. These motions seek to exclude certain evidence or arguments from being presented at the upcoming trial. 

**Key Points:**

* **Insurance Evidence:**

    * Evidence of insurance coverage, settlements, or other collateral source benefits is generally excluded except for the actual amount paid for medical bills.

* **Expert Testimony:**

    * Testimony from expert Barry Horn is excluded due to prior rulings against his opinions.

* **Genetic Causes:**

    * Evidence of speculative genetic causes for mesothelioma is too vague and denied without prejudice.

* **Talc Pleurodesis Procedure:**

    * Evidence about a procedure called talc pleurodesis is excluded unless the Plaintiff had this procedure.

* **Asbestos Definitions:**

    * Evidence about different types of asbestos and cleavage fragments is denied without prejudice.

* **Defendant's Product Containing Asbestos:**

    * Defendant Charles B. Chrystal Company's motion to exclude evidence that its product contained asbestos is denied as it's a disputed fact for the jury.

* **Talc-Related Diseases:**

    * Evidence about diseases caused by talc other than mesothelioma (e.g., ovarian cancer) is excluded as irrelevant and prejudicial.

* **Other Lawsuits:**

    *  Evidence about other lawsuits involving Johnson & Johnson is largely excluded, except for evidence directly relevant to knowledge of asbestos hazards.

* **Avon Products Use:**

    * Motion to exclude evidence about Plaintiff's use of Avon products is denied as too vague.

* **Talc-Based Powder Discontinuation:**

    * Motion to exclude evidence about Johnson & Johnson discontinuing talc-based baby powder sales is denied without prejudice.

* **Media Reports:**

    * Three Reuters articles about talc litigation are excluded unless an expert establishes their basis for reliance.

* **IWGACP:**

    * Evidence about the IWGACP is denied without prejudice unless an expert establishes its use as background information.

* **Foreign Investigations:**

    * Evidence about foreign governmental investigations is excluded as irrelevant and prejudicial.

* **Concealment of Asbestos Information:**

    * Evidence that litigation forced Johnson & Johnson to disclose asbestos information is excluded.

* **Dr. Jacqueline Moline's Article:**

    * Content of Dr. Jacqueline Moline's article is excluded unless an expert establishes its admissibility.

* **Alice Blount's Testing:**

    * Content of Alice Blount's testing results are excluded unless an expert establishes their reliability.

* **Bankruptcy Proceedings:**

    * Evidence about the LTL Management bankruptcy is excluded as irrelevant.

**Overall:**

The Judge is carefully considering the arguments presented by both parties and applying legal precedent and rules of evidence to rule on admissibility of evidence at trial.
