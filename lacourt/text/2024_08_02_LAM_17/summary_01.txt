And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's fourth amended complaint (4AC) is overruled. The plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to support claims of elder abuse and wrongful death, despite the defendant's arguments that the allegations are vague and lacking in specificity. The judge has also denied the defendant's motion to strike portions of the 4AC, finding that the allegations of negligence and recklessness by the defendant's staff are sufficient to support the claims. The judge has also found that the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to support a prayer for punitive damages and attorney fees. The case will proceed to a hearing on August 2, 2024, unless all parties submit to the tentative ruling.
