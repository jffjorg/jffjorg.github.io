And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motions to compel initial responses to discovery and to have the requests for admission (RFAs) deemed admitted. The plaintiff's motions to compel initial responses are moot because the defendant has provided amended responses. However, the plaintiff's motion to have the RFAs deemed admitted is granted because the defendant's responses were not properly verified. The defendant is sanctioned $350.00 for failing to provide proper responses to the RFAs. The parties are required to submit on the tentative by email by 4 p.m. the day prior to the hearing, and if all parties submit, the court will adopt the tentative as the final order.
