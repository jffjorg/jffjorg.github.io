And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel further responses from the plaintiff. The plaintiff had failed to provide complete responses to the defendant's requests for production of documents. The judge found that the plaintiff's responses were not Code-compliant and did not provide sufficient information about the existence or non-existence of the requested documents. The judge ordered the plaintiff to serve further Code-compliant responses to the defendant's requests within 20 days. The judge also imposed sanctions on the plaintiff and its attorney in the amount of $2,610. If the plaintiff fails to comply with the court's order, the defendant may file a motion to compel compliance.
