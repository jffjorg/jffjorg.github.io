English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The defendant's motion for summary adjudication of the plaintiff's claim for noneconomic damages is denied. The defendant argues that the plaintiff cannot recover noneconomic damages because he was not insured at the time of the accident. However, the court finds that the plaintiff's claim is not subject to summary adjudication as the damages at issue are not punitive damages. The court also notes that the defendant's citation to case law is incorrect and that the case law cited is not relevant to the issue at hand.
