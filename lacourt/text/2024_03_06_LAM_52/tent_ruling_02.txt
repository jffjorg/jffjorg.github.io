 Case Number:  21STCV42411    Hearing Date:   March 6, 2024    Dept:  52 Plaintiff Lois Meehan’s Motion for
Leave to File Second Amended Complaint or, in the Alternative, to Substitute
Lois Meehan for Gerald Meehan as Plaintiff
Plaintiff Lois Meehan moves for leave
to file a second amended complaint.  Courts
have discretion to permit an amendment to any pleading “in furtherance of
justice, and on any terms as may be proper.” (CCP § 473(a)(1).)  “This discretion should be exercised
liberally in favor of amendments, for judicial policy favors resolution of all
disputed matters in the same lawsuit.”  (Kittredge
Sports Co. v. Superior Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1047.)  Courts exercise their discretion “liberally
to permit amendment,” and “[t]he policy favoring amendment is so strong that it
is a rare case in which denial of leave to amend can be justified.”  (Howard v. County of San Diego (2010)
184 Cal.App.4th 1422, 1428.)  
Plaintiff shows good cause to permit
leave to file the second amended complaint. 
Defendants do not oppose the motion.
Among other amendments, the second
amended complaint substitutes Lois Meehan as successor-in-interest for the late
plaintiff Gerald Meehan.  Code of Civil
Procedure section 377.31 provides, “On motion after the death of a person who
commenced an action or proceeding, the court shall allow a pending action or
proceeding that does not abate to be continued by the decedent’s personal
representative or, if none, by the decedent’s successor in interest.”  Lois Meehan’s declaration fulfills the
requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 377.32.    
Plaintiff Lois Meehan’s motion for
leave to file second amended complaint is granted.  Plaintiff Lois Meehan shall file the second
amended complaint attached as Exhibit 1 to the declaration of Scott Meehan
forthwith.
