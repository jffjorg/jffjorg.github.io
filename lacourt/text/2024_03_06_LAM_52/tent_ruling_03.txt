Hourly Rates
For hourly rates,
“the trial court is in the best position to value the services rendered by the
attorneys.”  (569 East County Boulevard
LLC v. Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc. (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 426, 436.)  Courts may rely on their “own knowledge and
familiarity with the legal market, as well as the experience, skill, and
reputation of the attorney requesting fees, the difficulty or complexity of the
litigation to which that skill was applied, and affidavits from other attorneys
regarding prevailing fees in the community and rate determinations in other
cases.” (Id. at p. 437, citations omitted.)
Plaintiffs’
counsel sometimes used its most experienced attorneys to do work that could
have been done by a less experienced attorney with a lower rate.  For example, Norman F. Taylor has over 35
years of experience bringing cases under the Song-Beverly Act.  (Taylor Decl., ¶ 6.)  He participated in writing the CACI jury
instructions for the statute and has written two books on consumer warranty
laws.  (Id., ¶¶ 9-10.)  But Taylor billed for simple tasks such as 0.7
hours on June 16, 2022, to “check the trial calendar; draft and prepare
plaintiffs’ CMC statement and notice of posting jury fees” (id., Ex. 1, p.
4) and 6.9 hours drafting written discovery on November 16, 2022 (id.,
p. 5).  
Based on its
knowledge of the legal market, its review of the credentials and experience of
plaintiffs’ attorneys, the routine nature of this Song-Beverly Consumer
Warranty Act case, and the particular tasks performed by counsel, the court
reduces the rates for plaintiffs’ counsel and paralegals as shown below:



Timekeeper

$450

Hours
In calculating the lodestar, the court must determine
whether the tasks performed by an attorney were necessary and whether the
amount of time billed for each task was reasonable.  (Baxter
v. Bock (2016) 247 Cal.App.4th 775, 793.) 
The moving party has the burden of proof on these issues.  (Ibid.)  The number of hours billed may be
unreasonable if the case is “overstaffed” with too many lawyers, resulting in
redundant or unnecessary work.  (Hensley v. Eckerhart (1983) 461 U.S.
424, 434).  
After reviewing counsel’s billing records (Taylor
Decl., Ex. 1; Wirtz Decl., Ex. 1), the court finds plaintiffs reasonably incurred
all attorney fees with one exception.  They
claim 6 hours at $550 hourly for anticipated work by Amy R. Rotman reviewing
defendant’s opposition, drafting the reply, and preparing for the hearing.  (Wirtz Decl., Ex. 1, p. 23.)  Defendant did not oppose this motion.  Plaintiffs did not file a reply.  The court will therefore reduce these entries
from 6 hours to 1.5 hours incurred preparing for and attending the
hearing.    
Multiplier
Plaintiffs seek a
1.5 multiplier to the lodestar.  The
court finds no multiplier is appropriate. 
Multipliers may be awarded based on factors including “(1) the novelty
and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting
them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other
employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.”  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24
Cal.4th 1122, 1132.)  
This case did not
involve novel or difficult questions. 
Plaintiffs’ counsel did not demonstrate exceptional skill in litigating
the case.  Counsel’s hourly rates
adequately account for representation on contingency.  (See Horsford v. Board of Trustees of
California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 395.)
DISPOSITION
            Plaintiffs’
motion for attorney fees is granted in part. 
After accounting for the reduced hourly rates and hours, the court
calculates the award this way:
