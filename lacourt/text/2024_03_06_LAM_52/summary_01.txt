And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to strike or tax the memorandum of costs filed by plaintiff Gabriel Flores. The defendants, Medicali Holdings Inc., Outleaf, and Charles Weinberger, are seeking to strike or tax the memorandum of costs, which claims $775 in filing fees, $1,650 for the reporter's transcript, and $49.50 for service of papers. The Judge has concluded that Gabriel Flores did not incur any costs for the appeal on which the Court of Appeal permitted him to recover costs, and therefore he cannot recover the costs he claims. The defendants' motion to strike or tax the memorandum of costs is granted, and the entire memorandum of costs on appeal filed by Gabriel Flores is hereby struck.
