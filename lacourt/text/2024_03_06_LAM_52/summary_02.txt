And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Lois Meehan's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint, or in the alternative, to substitute Lois Meehan for Gerald Meehan as plaintiff. The motion is granted, as the court has discretion to permit amendments "in furtherance of justice" and the policy favors resolution of all disputed matters in the same lawsuit. Lois Meehan has shown good cause to permit the amendment, and the defendants do not oppose the motion. The second amended complaint substitutes Lois Meehan as successor-in-interest for the late plaintiff Gerald Meehan, in compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section 377.31. The plaintiff is ordered to file the second amended complaint forthwith.
