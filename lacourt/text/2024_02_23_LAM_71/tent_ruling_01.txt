 Case No.: 
  22STCV30076
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  February 23, 2024



 
Plaintiff
Alexandria Danielle Mosher’s motion for
attorneys’ fees and costs is granted in the total reduced amount of $23,085.38.  Plaintiff’s request for attorneys’ fees is
granted in the reduced amount of $21,988.00, and Plaintiff’s costs is granted
in the amount of $1,097.38.

 
Plaintiff Alexandria Danielle Mosher (“Mosher”)
(“Plaintiff”) moves for an order awarding her attorneys’ fees, reasonable
costs, and expenses and against Defendants Hyundai Motor
America (“HMA”) and Parkway Hyundai (“Parkway”) (collectively, “Defendants”) as
the prevailing party pursuant to the accepted Release and Settlement Agreement
(“Settlement Agreement”) accepted and signed by Plaintiff on October 09, 2023. 
(Notice of Motion, pgs. i-ii; Civ. Code §1794(d).)  Plaintiff moves for an order entering
Judgment against Defendants, and in favor of Plaintiff, for attorneys’ fees in
the amount of $25,034.50, and costs in the amount of $1,097.38.  (Notice of Motion, pg. ii.)
 
Background
This is a lemon law action
brought under the Song-Beverly Act (“Act”). 
On October
9, 2023,
Plaintiff accepted a Settlement made by Defendants in the amount of $27,995.24,
and Defendants agreed in the offer that Plaintiff will surrender the Subject
Vehicle and thereafter, should Plaintiff’s counsel and Defendants not agree on
an attorney’s fees amount, Plaintiff will have the right to petition this Court
for an award of the fees, costs, and expenses reasonably earned and incurred
during this litigation, thereafter.  (See
Decl. of Saeedian ¶¶17-18.)
On
January 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion for attorneys’ fees.  Defendants filed their opposition on February
8, 2024.  Plaintiff filed her reply on February
15, 2024, as well as her memorandum of costs.
 
Discussion
Civil Code §1794(d) provides that a
buyer who prevails in an action under that section, “shall be allowed by the
court to recover as a part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount
of costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on actual time expended,
determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in
connection with the commencement and the prosecution of such action.” 
Here, Plaintiff is the prevailing party
per parties’ agreement and is entitled to attorneys’ fees and costs, and
Defendants do not contest this issue.
 
Reasonable
Fees
To calculate
a lodestar amount, the Court must first determine the reasonableness of the
hourly rates sought by the Plaintiff’s counsel. The Supreme Court of California
has concluded that a reasonable hourly lodestar rate is the prevailing rate for
private attorneys “conducting non-contingent litigation of the same type.”  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1133, emphasis added.)
Plaintiff’s
Counsel declares the following hourly rates of the attorneys who worked on this
case: (1) Michael Saeedian ($695.00/hour); and (2) Christopher Urner ($525.00/hour).
 (Decl. of Saeedian ¶¶3-4.)  These rates are appropriate given each
attorney’s relative experience and qualifications.  (See id.)  Plaintiff has sufficiently demonstrated her
counsel’s hourly rates are reasonable in their community of practice in their
specialized area of law.
Defendants challenge
Plaintiff’s counsels’ hourly rate, arguing Plaintiff failed to meet her burden
to demonstrate her counsels’ rates are reasonable.  Defendants’ argument is unavailing.  A declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel is
sufficient evidence of the market rates charged in the legal community,
especially where no evidence is presented to the contrary.[1]  (See Davis v. City of San Diego (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th
893, 902-904; Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144
Cal.App.4th 140, 154; see Decl. of Saeedian ¶12.)  The Court finds Plaintiff’s counsels’ rates
to be reasonable and does not warrant a reduction.
 
Billed
Hours
The party
seeking fees and costs bears the burden to show “the fees incurred were
allowable, were reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation, and were
reasonable in amount.”  (Nightingale
v. Hyundai Motor America (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 104.) 
Plaintiff’s
fee recovery is based on the 52.6 hours spent by her attorneys litigating this
case.  (Decl. of Saeedian ¶23, Exh. A.)  Defendants argue several categories of
Plaintiff’s counsel’s billed hours were unsubstantiated or unreasonable and
should be reduced.  (Opposition, pgs.
7-10.)  The Court has reviewed Defendants’
objections to Plaintiff’s counsel’s billed hours and agrees with some of
Defendants’ objections.
First,
Defendants’ objection to Plaintiff’s request for fees and costs from Parkway,
which was only sued in this action for a negligent repair cause of action, is
well taken.  Here, Plaintiff is only
entitled to recovery attorneys’ fees and costs on her Song-Beverly causes of
action, not a cause of action in tort.  (Akins
v. Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1127, 1133 [“When a
cause of action for which attorney fees are provided by statute is joined with
other causes of action for which attorney fees are not permitted, the
prevailing party may recover only on the statutory cause of action.”]; Pellegrino
v. Robert Half International, Inc. (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 278 [“Where fees
are authorized for some causes of action in a complaint but not others,
allocation is a matter within the trial court’s discretion . . . . [and] a
trial court’s discretion is abused only when its ruling ‘exceeds the bounds of
reason, all of the circumstances before it being considered.’”].)  Therefore, the Court reduces Plaintiffs’
request for fees by $3,046.50 for work done exclusively litigating this case
against Parkway.
Second,
Defendants’ objection to Plaintiff’s counsel’s fees incurred in connection with
Plaintiff’s pursuit of discovery is unavailing.  Defendant concedes that it has received
written discovery in this case, and Plaintiff is entitled to recover fees
incurred in the course of litigation.  (Opposition,
pg. 6.)  Defendants fail to support their
argument with case law to support a reduction in fees for using templates.  Therefore, Defendants did not meet their
burden to challenge these fees.
Third, the
Court also disagrees with Defendant’s objection to the 8.6 hours ($2,889.50)
Plaintiff’s counsel billed for client communications.  A review of Plaintiff’s billing record
indicates these billing entries are not block billed and are separately entered
into the billing statement with a description of the topic of conversation.  Defendants fail to support their argument
with case law to support a reduction in fees. Therefore, Defendants did not
meet their burden to challenge these fees.
Defendants’ fourth
objection to 3.9 hours on the instant fee motion is unavailing.  General arguments that fees claimed are
excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice.  (Id.)  Further, Defendants’ argument that Plaintiff
cannot recover fees for reviewing the opposition and preparing a reply are now
moot.   Therefore, Defendant did not meet
its burden to challenge these fees.
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s request for attorneys’ fees is granted in the reduced amount of $21,988.00.
 
Costs
The California
legislature intended the word “expenses” in the Act to cover outlays not
included in the detailed statutory definition of “costs,” and the legislative
history of the Act further demonstrates that the legislature exercised its
power to permit the recovery by prevailing buyers of a host of litigation
expenditures.  (Jensen v. BMW of North
America, Inc. (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 112, 137-138.)  “If the items appearing in a cost bill appear
to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show
that they were not reasonable or necessary. On the other hand, if the items are
properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on the
party claiming them as costs.”  (Nelson v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th
111, 131.) 
Any effort to tax
or strike costs must occur in the form of a motion to strike or to tax costs
and must be served and filed fifteen (15) days after service of the cost
memorandum.  (CRC, Rule 3.1700(b)(1).)  After the 15-day deadline to file a motion to
tax costs has passed, the Court clerk must immediately enter the costs. (CRC,
Rule 3.1700(b)(4).)
Defendants do not
challenge Plaintiff’s requested costs.
Accordingly, Plaintiff
is entitled to costs in the amount of $1,097.38.
 
Conclusion
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s request
for attorneys’ fees is granted in the reduced amount of $21,988.00, and Plaintiff’s costs is granted in
the amount of $1,097.38. 
Plaintiff’s motion is granted in the total reduced amount of $23,085.38.
