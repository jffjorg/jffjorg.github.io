  Case Number:  20STCV42653    Hearing Date:   January 16, 2025    Dept:  1 Background of 20STCV37963 Doe S.V. v.
Doe
 
On October 2, 2020, Plaintiff John Doe S.V.
filed this action against John Does 1 through 8 asserting causes of action for:
(1) childhood sexual assault as defined by C.C.P. section 340.1; (2)
battery; (3) assault; (4) negligence; (5) negligent
retention/supervision/failure to warn; (6) breach of fiduciary duty; (7) fiduciary
fraud and conspiracy; and (8) gross negligence.
 
The complaint alleged the defendants “worked cooperatively
to conduct a DARE program for the students at St. John the Baptist Catholic
Elementary School in Baldwin Park, California.” (Compl. ¶ 12.) Doe 1 allegedly
began grooming Plaintiff in 1989, which allegedly led to more than a dozen
sexual assaults over a five-year period beginning in 1991. The complaint
further alleges the Defendants failed to take steps to protect Plaintiff,
concealed Doe 1’s assaults, and continued to assign Doe 1 to positions where he
would engage with minors, including Plaintiff. 
 
On August
23, 2021, the court entered the parties’ stipulation and order to add-on and
coordinate this action to JCCP 5101 In
re: Southern California Clergy Cases. 
 
On
April 29, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed “DEFENDANT JOHN DOE 4 (Roman Catholic
Archbishop of Los Angeles); DEFENDANT JOHN DOE 5 (Roman Catholic Archdiocese of
Los Angeles); DEFENDANT JOHN DOE 6 (The Archdiocese of Los Angeles Risk
Management Corporation); DEFENDANT JOHN DOE 7 (The Archdiocese of Los Angeles
Education & Welfare Corporation); DEFENDANT JOHN DOE 8 (St. John’s Seminary
in California)” from the action.
 
On June
21, 2024, as amended nunc pro tunc on July 3, 2024, the court severed
20STCV37963 from JCCP 5101 and deemed the matter noncomplex. The order further
provided “Counsel to file a Notice of Related Case pursuant to CRC 3.300.”
 
On
July 11, 2024, Judge Christian R. Gullon issued an order finding “20STCV37963
and 22PSCV03108, are not related within the meaning of California Rules of
Court, rule 3.300(a).
 
On September 17, 2024, the court granted
Plaintiff’s application to file an amended complaint naming the defendants. The
court’s ordered “to file the Amended Complaint by end of business on Friday,
September 20, 2024.” Plaintiff has not filed an amended complaint.
 
This case is pending in Department O of the Pomona
Courthouse with the Case Management Conference Set for March 4, 2025. 
 
Background of 22PSCV03108 Doe J. R.
v. Doe
 
On December 29, 2022, plaintiff Doe J.R.
filed this action against John Does 1 through 3. On March 25, 2024,
Plaintiff filed the Second Amended Complaint naming the Defendants. The SAC
alleges the Defendants “worked cooperatively to conduct a DARE program for the
students at local schools in Baldwin Park, California.” (SAC ¶ 8.) Plaintiff
allegedly interacted with Doe 1 through the DARE and explorer programs and was
later sexually assaulted by Doe 1 in 1993. The SAC alleges Defendants failed to
take steps to protect Plaintiff, concealed Doe 1’s assaults, and continued to
assign Doe 1 to positions where he would engage with minors, including
Plaintiff. 
 
This case is pending in Department 6 of the West
Covina Courthouse.
 
Motion 
 
On September 18, 2024, Plaintiffs John Doe
S.V. and John Doe J.R. filed the instant motion seeking to relate 20STCV37963
and 22PSCV03108. 
 
Opposition
 
In opposition, Doe 1 contends the cases are
not related because they do not involve the same parties or the same claims and
the Plaintiffs allegedly met Doe 1 under different circumstances.
 
In a separate opposition, Doe 2 and 3 contend
the motion is untimely and the cases are not related because they involve
different plaintiffs, different claims, and the Plaintiffs allegedly met Doe 1 under
different circumstances.
 
Reply
 
In
reply, Plaintiffs argue the motion is timely and the cases will require a
substantial duplication of judicial resources if heard by different judges.
 
Motion
to Relate Cases
 
Standard

 
Pursuant
to Local Rule 3.3(f)(3), “[i]n the event that the judge designated under
California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(h)(1)(A)(B)(C) to make the decision, does
not order related any of the cases set forth in the Notice of Related Cases,
any party may file a motion to have the cases related. Department 1 shall hear
the motion, if the cases are all pending in the Central District or are pending
in two or more different districts.”
 
Department
1 Finds the Two Cases are Related 
 
On July 11, 2024, Judge Gullon issued an order declining to relate 20STCV37963
and 22PSCV03108. Accordingly, the motion is properly brought in Department 1.
(LASC Local Rules, rule 3.3(f)(3).) In their opposition, Does 2 and 3
contend the motion is untimely. (Doe 2 Opp. at 3:14-3:26.) However, Does 2 and
3 cites the non-jurisdictional deadline for filing a Notice of Related Case.
(Ibid.) Neither California Rules of Court
3.300(h)(1)(D) nor LASC Local Rules, rule 3.3(f)(3) impose a time
constraint upon a motion to relate cases. 
 
Cases
are related when they (1) involve the same parties and are based on the same or
similar claims, (2) arise from the same or substantially identical
transactions, incidents, or events requiring the determination of the same or
substantially identical questions of law or fact, (3) involve claims against,
title to, possession of, or damages to the same property, or (4) are likely for
other reasons to require substantial duplication of judicial resources if heard
by different judges. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(a).)
                                                                                       
Plaintiffs
contend the cases are related based upon the first, second, and fourth grounds
enumerated in Rule 3.300(a). 
 
Plaintiffs
note the cases involve “childhood sexual assault perpetrated by the same
Perpetrator Defendant who was employed by the same City Defendant and Police
Department Defendant.” (Mot. at 4:21-25.) As argued in the oppositions, the
case involve different plaintiffs are therefore do not involve the same
parties. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(a)(1).)
 
Plaintiffs
also contend the cases arise from the same or substantially identical
transactions, incidents, or events requiring the determination of the same or
substantially identical questions of law or fact. (Mot. at 5:14-22; Cal. R.
Ct., rule 3.300(a)(2).) In opposition, Doe 1 contends the Plaintiff Doe S.V.
alleges they met Doe 1 in 1989 at a Catholic school whereas Plaintiff Doe J.R.
testified they met Doe 1 at the Police Department in 1993. (Doe 1. Opp. at
4:11-26.) Doe 1 further argues Plaintiff Doe S.V. asserted fiduciary claims
that are not present in 22PSCV03108 and therefore there is not “a complete
identity of legal issues between the two cases.” (Doe 1 Opp. at 4:27-5:7.) In
their opposition, Does 2 and 3 similarly cite the manner in which the
Plaintiffs allegedly met Doe 1. (Does 2 Opp. at 4:26-5:17.) Does 2 and 3’s
opposition also appears to partially respond to different cases as Does 2 and 3
contends “[t]he alleged events also occurred almost ten years apart.” (Doe 2
Opp. at 5:7.) However, Plaintiff Doe S.V. alleges the first assault occurred in
1991 and continued “over a five year period,” (Doe S.V. FAC ¶¶ 25-29), whereas
Plaintiff Doe J.R. alleges the assault occurred in 1993. (Doe J.R. SAC ¶ 3.) 
 
The
cases arise from the same or substantially identical transactions, incidents,
or events requiring the determination of the same or substantially identical
questions of law or fact. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(a)(2).) Both cases arise out
of an alleged sexual assault of a minor by Doe 1, for which Does 2 and 3 are
allegedly also liable. Does 2 and 3’s conduct, knowledge regarding Doe 1, and
potential liability are issues that will require the determination of
substantially identical questions of law and fact in both cases. Moreover,
because the cases involve the same defendants and alleged childhood sexual
assaults during the same time period, the cases are likely to require a
substantial duplication of judicial resources if heard by different judges. (Cal.
R. Ct., rule 3.300(a)(4).) Having these two cases heard by the same judicial
officer is likely to promote judicial efficiency and reduce the risk of
inconsistent rulings on similar issues. 
 
The
Court finds the cases are related within the meaning of California Rules of
Court, rule 3.300.
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiffs’
Motion to Relate Cases is GRANTED. 
 
Department
1 relates 20STCV37963 and 22PSCV03108 and orders 22PSCV03108 reassigned to
Department O of the Pomona Courthouse South for all purposes. All hearings
currently set in 22PSCV03108 are hereby advanced and vacated.
