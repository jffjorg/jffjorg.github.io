 Case Number:  22STCV17243    Hearing Date:   January 16, 2025    Dept:  1 Background of 22STCV17243 LaLonde v.
Val-Pro
 
On May 25, 2022, Plaintiff Douglas LaLonde
filed this action against Val-Pro, Inc. arising out of his employment and
ownership of the company. The First Amended Complaint, filed February 6, 2023,
asserts ten causes of action under FEHA, a claim for retaliation under Labor
Code section 1102.5, a Tameny claim, a cause of action for breach of
fiduciary duty, and a request to remove a director. 
 
The FAC alleges Plaintiff was an employee,
director, and trustee of a trust owning fifty percent of the outstanding shares
of the company. Defendant Caroline LaLonde was also an employee, director, and
trustee of a trust owning the remaining shares. The FAC alleges Plaintiff
suffered from heart problems and melanoma. Defendants discriminated and
retaliated against him by:
 
a.     
Suspending Doug LaLonde on his return from
remote work on April 20, 2022 and then purporting to ''terminate" his
employment by letter dated December 6, 2022;
b.    
Stripping Doug LaLonde of his primary job
duties and management authorities;
c.     
Giving Carrie LaLonde management duties
and responsibilities that belonged to Doug Lalonde
d.    
Isolating Doug LaLonde from important
meetings and management decisions
e.     
Failing to adequately compensate Doug
LaLonde for his position when compared to Carrie LaLonde, a non-disabled
employee;
f.     
Secretly demoting Doug Lalonde while he
worked remotely; 
g.    
Failing to increase Doug LaLonde'·s salary
in lock step with Carrie LaLonde; 
h.    
Prohibiting Doug LaLonde from
communicating with company employees. 
i.      
Refusing to communicate with him; and 
j.      
Refusing to distribute retained earnings
or his salary.
(FAC ¶¶ 122, 159, 161.) The FAC also seeks to
remove Defendant Carrie LaLonde as the other director of Val-Pro.
 
On August 2, 2024, Judge Kerry Bensinger issued
a minute order finding “22STCV17243 and 24STCV11574, are not related within the
meaning of California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a).”
 
This case is pending in Department 31 of the
Stanley Mosk Courthouse with the next hearing set for February 6, 2025. 
 
Background of 24STCV11574 Val-Pro v.
LaLonde
 
On May 8, 2024, Val-Pro, Inc. filed
24STCV11574 against Douglas LaLonde asserting causes of action for: (1) breach
of written contract; (2) account stated; (3) open book account; (4) conversion;
and (5) violation of Penal Code section 496. The complaint alleged Douglas
LaLonde received a loan from Val-Pro and failed to pay the amount due.
 
On, the court sustained the demurrer to the
fourth and fifth causes of action without leave to amend.  
 
On September 16, 2024, Douglas LaLonde filed
a cross-complaint containing the same allegations and the same causes of action
as the First Amended Complaint filed in 22STCV17243, along with additional
claims.
 
This case is pending in Department 49 of the
Stanley Mosk Courthouse with the next hearing set for February 26, 2025. 
 
Motion 
 
On October 3, 2024, Douglas LaLonde filed the
instant motion seeking to relate 22STCV17243 with 24STCV11574.
 
The motion is unopposed. (Code Civ. Proc. §
1005.)
 
Motion
to Relate Cases
 
Standard

 
Pursuant
to Local Rule 3.3(f)(3), “[i]n the event that the judge designated under
California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(h)(1)(A)(B)(C) to make the decision, does
not order related any of the cases set forth in the Notice of Related Cases,
any party may file a motion to have the cases related. Department 1 shall hear
the motion, if the cases are all pending in the Central District or are pending
in two or more different districts.”
 
The
Two Cases are Now Related 
 
On August 2, 2024, Judge Kerry Bensinger issued
an order declining to relate 22STCV17243 and 24STCV11574. Accordingly, the
motion is properly brought in Department 1. (LASC Local Rules, rule 3.3(f)(3).)
 
Cases
are related when they (1) involve the same parties and are based on the same or
similar claims, (2) arise from the same or substantially identical
transactions, incidents, or events requiring the determination of the same or
substantially identical questions of law or fact, (3) involve claims against,
title to, possession of, or damages to the same property, or (4) are likely for
other reasons to require substantial duplication of judicial resources if heard
by different judges. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(a).)
 
Douglas
LaLonde filed the cross-complaint in 24STCV11574 after Judge Bensinger issued
the order finding the cases were not related. The cross-complaint contains the
same allegations and the same causes of action as the First Amended Complaint
filed in 22STCV17243. Accordingly, the cases satisfy the first, second, and
fourth grounds enumerated in California Rules of Court, rule 3.300. The cases
involve the same parties and similar claims, arise from the same or
substantially identical transactions, incidents, or events requiring the
determination of the same or substantially identical questions of law or fact,
and will require a substantial duplication of judicial resources if heard by
different judges. The Court finds the cases are related within the meaning of
California Rules of Court, rule 3.300. 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff
Douglas LaLonde’s Motion to Have Cases Deemed Related is GRANTED.
 
Department
1 relates 22STCV17243 and 24STCV11574 and orders 24STCV11574 reassigned to
Department 31 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse for all purposes. All hearings
currently set in 24STCV11574 are hereby advanced and vacated. 
 
Counsel
