 Case Number:  21STCV26474    Hearing Date:   January 16, 2025    Dept:  1 On July 19, 2021, Plaintiff Phyllis Stuart
filed this action against Defendant Stephen Dewitt arising out of Defendant’s
alleged failure to maintain the yard of real property located at 1040 Victoria
Blvd., Venice, California.
 
The case was initially assigned to Department
28 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
 
On April 29, 2024, this case was assigned to
Judge Ian C. Fusselman in Department T of the Alhambra Courthouse as part of
the unwinding of the Personal Injury courts.
 
On May 13, 2024, Judge Fusselman accepted a
peremptory challenge. The minute order provided, in relevant part: “[g]ood
cause appearing and on order of the Court, the above matter is reassigned at
the direction of the Supervising Judge to Judge Ralph C. Hofer in Department D
at the Glendale Courthouse for all further proceedings.”
 
On
June 20, 2024, Judge Hofer issued a minute order providing “[t]he Court notes
that the case is not in the correct venue. The case belongs at the Santa Monica
Courthouse.” 
 
On August
26, 2024, Judge Hofer issued a minute order again providing “The Court notes
that the case is not in the correct venue. The case belongs at the Santa Monica
Courthouse. . . . Counsel are ordered to file a motion in Department 1.” 
 
On
October 24, 2024, Judge Hofer issued a minute order providing “Plaintiff's
counsel is ordered to file a Motion For Change of Venue in Department 1 to be
heard prior to the next court date.”
 
Motion 
 
On October 28, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
instant motion to transfer this action to the Santa Monica Courthouse. 
 
The motion is unopposed. (Code Civ. Proc. §
1005.) 
 
Motion to Transfer Between Districts
 
Standard
 
LASC
Local Rules, rule 2.3(b)(2) authorizes Department 1 to transfer civil cases
from one judicial district to another via a noticed motion on three enumerated
grounds: (1) when the case was filed in an improper district; (2) for the
convenience of witnesses; or (3) to promote the ends of
justice. (LASC Local Rule 2.3(b)(2).) A transfer under the Local Rules is
discretionary. 
 
Because
the same language appears in both LASC Local Rule
2.3(b)(2) and Code of Civil Procedure section 397(c), Department 1 applies the
case authority related to Section 397. Accordingly, a party acting under the
authority of Los Angeles Superior Court Local Rule 2.3(b)(2) bears the same
burden of proof if it seeks a district transfer. (See Lieberman v. Superior Court (1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 396, 401.) That
burden of proof calls for affidavits that contain more than generalities and
conclusions. (See Hamilton v Superior Court (1974) 37 Cal.
App.3d 418, 424.) Convenience to non-party witnesses alone is the key to the
success of the motion, and not the convenience of parties or employees of
parties. (See Stute v. Burinda (1981) 123 Cal. App. 3d Supp. 11, 17.)
 
The Case was Initially Filed in
Accordance with the Local Rules
 
Plaintiff contends the case is in an improper
venue and relies upon Code of Civil Procedure sections 395(a), which
governs venue in the proper county, not the assignment of cases within a
superior court. (Mot. at 4:3-22.) The Local Rules of the Los Angeles Superior
Court govern the assignment of cases between districts and courthouses. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 402; LASC Local Rule 2.3; Glade v. Glade (1995) 38
Cal.App.4th 1441, 1449 (“Even though a superior court is divided into branches
or departments, pursuant to California Constitution, article VI, section 4,
there is only one superior court in a county and jurisdiction is therefore
vested in that court, not in any particular judge or department. Whether
sitting separately or together, the judges hold but one and the same court.”).)
 
When this case was filed, it was properly
assigned pursuant to the then-governing Local Rules and standing orders
regarding personal injury actions. Plaintiff has not demonstrated the case was
filed in an improper venue. Rather, the case was transferred for administrative
purposes and as a result of the acceptance of peremptory challenge.
 
The Convenience of Witnesses Warrant the
Requested Transfer
 
Plaintiff also contends the case should be
transferred for the convenience of witnesses. (Mot. at 4:23-6:4.) Plaintiff’s
counsel avers that Plaintiff resides in Venice, California, the incident
occurred in Venice, California, and defense counsel is agreeable to the
transfer. (Malek Decl. ¶¶ 3-9.) The Court finds the declaration from
Plaintiff’s counsel sufficient under the circumstances. (Rycz v.
Superior Court of San Francisco County (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 824, 846 n.22
(“Although that may be advisable where possible, witness declarations are not
required by section 397, subdivision (c); counsel declarations have been
employed in past published cases . . . and the inconvenience to witnesses may
be inferred where the witnesses are located far from the trial venue.”).)
 
The Court notes the current version of the
Local Rules would assign this action to the West District, which includes the Santa
Monica Courthouse. (LASC Local Rules, rule 2.3(A)(1)(A) (“Every
unlimited civil tort action for bodily injury, wrongful death, or damage to
personal property (hereinafter referred to as ‘Personal Injury Action’) must be
filed in the judicial district where the incident arose.”).) 
 
Accordingly,
the Court finds the convenience of witnesses warrants a transfer to the
district identified by Plaintiff.
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff’s
Motion to Transfer Venue is GRANTED and 21STCV26474 is ordered reassigned to
the Santa Monica Courthouse in the West District of the Los Angeles Superior
Court. 
 
Notice of case reassignment shall issue shortly. 
 
Clerk to give notice.
