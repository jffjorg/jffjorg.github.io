And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled that cases 22STCV17243 and 24STCV11574 are related. The cases involve the same parties and similar claims, arise from the same or substantially identical transactions, incidents, or events, and will require a substantial duplication of judicial resources if heard by different judges. As a result, the court grants the motion to relate the cases and orders case 24STCV11574 reassigned to Department 31 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse for all purposes. All hearings currently set in case 24STCV11574 are hereby advanced and vacated.
