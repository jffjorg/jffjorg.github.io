 Case Number:  22STCV22691    Hearing Date:   January 16, 2025    Dept:  1 Background of 22STCV22691 Baker
Electric & Renewables v. CannonDesign Builders
 
On July 13, 2022, Plaintiff Baker Electric
& Renewables, LLC filed this action against CannonDesign Builders, Inc.,
County of Los Angeles, and Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance Company. The
complaint asserted causes of action for: (1) breach of contract; (2) reasonable
value; (3) enforcement of stop payment notice; and (4) recovery on payment
bond. 
 
The complaint alleges Baker served as a
subcontractor for CannonDesign on a Los Angeles County public work of
improvement known as LAC+USC Restorative Care Village located at 1774
Zonal Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90033.” CannonDesign allegedly failed to
fully pay Baker for the work it performed. 
 
On
November 14, 2022, CannonDesign filed a cross-complaint against Roes 1 to 50
asserting claims for negligence, contribution, and breach of contract. 
 
On January 9, 2023, the court entered
Plaintiff’s request to dismiss the third causes of action in the complaint.
 
On January 13, 2023, the court entered
Plaintiff’s request to dismiss County of Los Angeles. 
 
On September 12, 2024, Judge Maureen
Duffy-Lewis entered a minute order providing, in relevant part: “The
Court finds that the following cases, 22STCV22691 and 24STCV07116, are not
related within the meaning of California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a). . . . There
is already a cross complaint by CannonDesign Builders on file in this case.
CannonDesign Builders could dismiss the later filed action (24STCV07116) and
via appropriate procedure, bring party into this case.”
 
This case is pending in Department 38 of the
Stanley Mosk Courthouse with trial set for April 14, 2025. 
 
Background of 24STCV07116 CannonDesign
Builders v. County of Los Angeles
 
On March 21, 2024, CannonDesign filed 24STCV07116
against County of Los Angeles asserting causes of action for: (1) breach of
contract; (2) breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (3)
violation of Public Contracts Code § 7107; (4) equitable/implied indemnity on
subcontractor pass-through claims; and (5) declaratory relief. 
 
The complaint alleges CannonDesign served as
the design-builder for the design and construction of the LAC+USC
Restorative Care Village at 1774 Zonal Avenue, Los Angeles California 90033. CannonDesign
alleges the County is liable for delays, inefficiencies, and changes in work,
as well as pass-through claims for costs incurred by its subcontractors. The
complaint further alleges “Plaintiff’s electrical subcontractor, Baker Electric
& Renewables, LLC, sued Plaintiff in Los Angeles County Superior Court,
Case No. 22STCV22691, seeking $836,231.10 for County caused delays as alleged
herein, which remains pending. The County has the implied obligation to
indemnify and compensate Plaintiff directly, or these subcontractors, for the
amounts on their respective pass-through claims.” (Compl. ¶  13.) CannonDesign’s claim for declaratory
relief seeks to resolve the parties’ disputes regarding the subcontractors who
“assert and allege that they are entitled to additional compensation, costs and
damages related to its performance and work furnished to the Project as a
result of County directed changes, design issues from defective and incomplete
information and scoping documents, and resultant impacts and/or delays caused
by the County and its agents.” (Compl. ¶ 50(A).) 
 
This case is pending in Department 55 of the
Stanley Mosk Courthouse with the next hearing set for January 30, 2025. 
 
Motion 
 
On September 19, 2024, CannonDesign Builders
filed the instant motion seeking to relate 22STCV22691 with 24STCV07116.
 
Opposition
 
In opposition, the County of Los Angeles argues
the cases do not involve the same parties, CannonDesign can only seek
reimbursement for one of Baker’s claims, and there will not be a substantial
duplication of judicial resources if the cases are heard by different judges.
 
Reply
 
In
reply, CannonDesign further asserts the cases are related and the parties’
dispute is indisputably intertwined. 
 
Motion
to Relate Cases
 
Standard

 
Pursuant
to Local Rule 3.3(f)(3), “[i]n the event that the judge designated under
California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(h)(1)(A)(B)(C) to make the decision, does
not order related any of the cases set forth in the Notice of Related Cases,
any party may file a motion to have the cases related. Department 1 shall hear
the motion, if the cases are all pending in the Central District or are pending
in two or more different districts.”
 
Department
1 Finds the Two Cases are Related 
 
On September 12, 2024, Judge Duffy-Lewis issued
an order declining to relate 22STCV22691 and 24STCV07116. Accordingly, the
motion is properly brought in Department 1. (LASC Local Rules, rule 3.3(f)(3).)
 
Cases
are related when they (1) involve the same parties and are based on the same or
similar claims, (2) arise from the same or substantially identical
transactions, incidents, or events requiring the determination of the same or
substantially identical questions of law or fact, (3) involve claims against,
title to, possession of, or damages to the same property, or (4) are likely for
other reasons to require substantial duplication of judicial resources if heard
by different judges. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(a).)
 
While
the cases are based on similar claims, they no longer involve the same parties
as the County of Los Angeles has been dismissed from 22STCV22691. (Cal. R. Ct.,
rule 3.300(a)(1).) 
 
However,
the cases arise from the same or substantially identical transactions,
incidents, or events requiring the determination of the same or substantially
identical questions of law or fact. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(a)(2).) Both cases
arise out of the LAC+USC Restorative Care Village and the payment of
subcontractors on the project. Both cases will require determinations of law
and fact regarding the applicable contracts and the alleged added costs due to
change orders, delays, and inefficiencies. CannonDesign’s cross-complaint in
22STCV17243 does not name any specific cross-defendant, but seeks contribution
for Baker’s claims. The complaint in 24STCV07116 similarly seeks to resolve the
County’s liability for claims made by CannonBuilder’s subcontractors, including
Baker. County’s argument in opposition, that some portion of Baker’s claims are
based on change orders rather than delays, is a merits issue that does not
negate the relatedness of the two cases. Because the cases involve the same construction
project, the same contractor, and the same claims from the subcontractor, the
cases are likely to require substantial duplication of judicial resources if
heard by different judges.” (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(a)(4).) The County’s
arguments regarding whether the jury will be misled, (Opp. at 3:21-23), are more
appropriately made in response to a motion to consolidate and are immaterial to
a motion to relate cases. Having the cases before the same judicial officer
promotes judicial efficiency and reduces the risk of inconsistent rulings
related to the same construction project and claims. 
 
The
Court finds the cases are related within the meaning of California Rules of
Court, rule 3.300. 
 
Conclusion
 
CannonDesign’s
Motion to Deem Cases Related is GRANTED.
 
Department
1 relates 22STCV22691 and 24STCV07116 and orders 24STCV07116 reassigned to
Department 38 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse for all purposes. All hearings
currently set in 24STCV07116 are hereby advanced and vacated.
