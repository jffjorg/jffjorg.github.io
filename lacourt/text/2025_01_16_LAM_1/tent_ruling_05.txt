Motion 
 
On October 4, 2024, Southern California
Edison filed the instant motion seeking to relate 22STCV28302,
23STCV22007, and 23STLC03340.
 
The
motion is unopposed. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1005.) 
 
Motion
to Relate Cases
 
Standard

 
Pursuant
to Local Rule 3.3(f)(3), “[i]n the event that the judge designated under
California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(h)(1)(A)(B)(C) to make the decision, does
not order related any of the cases set forth in the Notice of Related Cases,
any party may file a motion to have the cases related. Department 1 shall hear
the motion, if the cases are all pending in the Central District or are pending
in two or more different districts.”
 
Department
1 Only Relates Pending Cases
 
On
November 18, 2024, the court entered an order dismissing 23STLC03340 Radulescu
v. Southern California Edison Company. Accordingly, this case is no longer
pending for purposes of Local Rule 3.3(f)(3) and the Court declines to relate
completed case 23STLC03340 to pending cases 22STCV28302 and 23STCV22007.
 
Department
1 Finds the Two Pending Cases are Related 
 
On
June 13, 2024, Judge Hwang
issued an order finding “22STCV28302 and 23STLC03340, are not related within
the meaning of California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a).” The order did not
address 23STCV22007, which was also listed in the June 12, 2024 Notice. Accordingly, the motion is properly brought
in Department 1. (LASC Local Rules, rule 3.3(f)(3).) 
 
Cases
are related when they (1) involve the same parties and are based on the same or
similar claims, (2) arise from the same or substantially identical
transactions, incidents, or events requiring the determination of the same or
substantially identical questions of law or fact, (3) involve claims against,
title to, possession of, or damages to the same property, or (4) are likely for
other reasons to require substantial duplication of judicial resources if heard
by different judges. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(a).)
                                                                                       
Defendant
contends the cases are related based upon the first, second, and fourth grounds
enumerated in Rule 3.300(a).
 
The
two pending civil cases, 22STCV28302 and 23STCV22007, do not involve the same parties as only Kalif
Construction and Southern California Edison are parties to both cases.  (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(a)(1).)  
 
However,
the Court agrees the two cases arise from the same or substantially identical
transactions, incidents, or events requiring the determination of the same or
substantially identical questions of law or fact, (Cal. R. Ct., rule
3.300(a)(2)), and are likely for other reasons to require substantial
duplication of judicial resources if heard by different judges. (Cal. R. Ct.,
rule 3.300(a)(4).) Both cases arise out of the January 13, 2022 incident
involving the electrical pole and will require substantially identical determinations
of law and fact regarding the cause of the incident, the duties owed between
Kalif Construction and Southern California Edison, and the relative fault of
the parties. The cases assert many of the same indemnification claims and are
likely to involve identical legal issues. Having the two pending cases heard by
the same judicial officer is likely to promote judicial efficiency and reduce
the risk of inconsistent rulings on similar issues.
 
The
Court finds the cases are related within the meaning of California Rules of
Court, rule 3.300.
 
Conclusion
 
Southern
California Edison’s Motion to Have Cases Related, or in the Alternative, Motion
for Reconsideration of the Court’s Minute Order of June 13, 2024 is GRANTED. 
 
Department
1 relates 22STCV28302 and 23STCV22007 and orders 23STCV22007 reassigned to
Department 28 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse for all purposes. All hearings
currently set in 23STCV22007 are hereby advanced and vacated.
