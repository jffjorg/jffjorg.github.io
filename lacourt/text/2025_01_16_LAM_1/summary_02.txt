And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion to transfer the case to the Santa Monica Courthouse. The case was initially filed in Department 28, but was reassigned to Judge Ian C. Fusselman and then to Judge Ralph C. Hofer. The plaintiff alleges that the case was filed in an improper venue and that the convenience of witnesses warrants a transfer. The judge finds that the case was properly assigned initially, but that the convenience of witnesses does warrant a transfer. The judge orders the case to be reassigned to the Santa Monica Courthouse and notes that the current version of the Local Rules would have assigned the case to the West District, which includes the Santa Monica Courthouse.
