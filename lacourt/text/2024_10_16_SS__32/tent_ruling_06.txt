CASE NUMBER:


22STCV25667




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  to be Relieved as Counsel




MOVING PARTY:


Plaintiff Maliyah McKnight’s Counsel




OPPOSING PARTY:


None



 
BACKGROUND
 
            Plaintiff
Maliyah McKnight’s (Plaintiff) counsel
of record, Corral Law PC, Laiken Law Group and Attorneys Nathalie E. Corral and
Ashley A. Laiken (Counsel), moves to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff.
Counsel contends relief is necessary because there has been a breakdown in the attorney-client
relationship and communications. 
 
            No
opposition has been filed for this motion. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
To be granted relief as counsel, counsel must comply with California
Rules of Court (CRC) 3.1362. Even where grounds for termination exist,
attorneys seeking to withdraw must comply with the procedures set forth in
California Rule of Professional Conduct (CRPC) 3.700 and are subject to
discipline for failure to do so. CRPC 3.700(B) lists various grounds for
mandatory withdrawal. 
 
An attorney's right to terminate the attorney-client relationship and
withdraw from a case is not absolute. (See Vann v. Shilleh (1975) 54 Cal.App.3d
192, 197; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398.) The decision whether to
grant or deny an application for withdrawal is within the court's discretion,
and it does not abuse that discretion by denying the application on the ground
that the attorney's withdrawal would work injustice upon a third party.
(Hodcarriers, Bldg. and Common Laborers Local Union No. 89 v. Miller (1966) 243
Cal.App.2d 391.)
 
The rules have been liberally construed to protect clients. (Vann v.
Shilleh, supra, 54 Cal.App.3d 192.) An attorney, either with client's consent
or court's approval, may withdraw from a case when withdrawal can be
accomplished without undue prejudice to client's interests; however, an
attorney “shall not withdraw from employment until the member has taken
reasonable steps to avoid reasonably foreseeable prejudice to the rights of the
client, including giving due notice to the client, allowing time for employment
of other counsel, complying with rule 3-700(D), and complying with applicable
laws and rules.” (CRPC 3.700(A)(2).) A lawyer violates his or her ethical
mandate by abandoning a client (Pineda v. State Bar (1989) 49 Cal.3d 753, 758
759), or by withdrawing at a critical point and thereby prejudicing the
client’s case. (CRPC 3.700(A)(2); Vann v. Shilleh, supra.)
 
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Counsel has filed forms MC-051 and
MC-052 and has lodged with the Court a copy of the proposed order on form
MC-053 as required.  (Cal Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362.)  Counsel states the instant
motion is filed for the following reason: “Plaintiff and Counsel have
encountered a breakdown in the relationship and communications. Therefore
Plaintiff’s counsel wishes to withdraw pursuant to California Rules of
Professional Conduct 3-700(c) and 3-700(b).” (MC-052.) 
 
            On September 11, 2024, the Court denied the previous
motion for relief because proof of service was defective, and it was unclear
how a Lexis Nexis search would sufficiently confirm Plaintiff’s address. Therefore,
the Court ordered Counsel to attempt the methods in item 3b(2) of MC-052 and
mark them accordingly in a future motion to be relieved. However, the current
motion was not corrected, and “Lexis Nexis search” was listed as the method
used to confirm the Plaintiff’s address. 
 
Accordingly, the Court DENIES the motion to relieve
counsel.  
 
Counsel shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file
proofs of service of such.
