And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a motion to compel production of documents from non-parties Charles Gruver, M.D. and Joseph Enayati, M.D. by Defendant Uber Technologies, Inc. The Court finds that the meet and confer requirement has been met, and that the non-parties have failed to provide a sufficient basis for their objections to the subpoenas.

The Court grants in part the motion to compel, ordering the non-parties to produce redacted documents in response to Request for Production of Documents Nos. 6, 34, 44-47, 66, 68-69, and 75, limited to two years before and after Plaintiff Kenny Reese was referred to LA Pain and Beverly Hills Pain & Spine.

The Court also denies the non-parties' request for monetary sanctions against Uber Technologies, Inc., finding that the defendant acted with substantial justification in bringing the motion. Finally, the Court orders the non-parties to provide an estimate with sufficient information for their reasonable and actual costs of production, contingent upon their production of the documents.
