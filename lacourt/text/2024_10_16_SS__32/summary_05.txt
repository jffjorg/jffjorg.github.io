And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petition filed by Petitioner Henrietta Riojas on behalf of Claimant Sky Riojas, who was bitten by bed bugs and still suffers from temporary injuries. The court denies the petition without prejudice for several reasons. The petitioner must provide medical records and reports to support the claimed injuries, and explain the reason for apportioning funds. Additionally, the petitioner must provide total medical expenses and the amount reimbursed to Medi-Cal, and justify the requested attorney fees. The court also notes contradictions in the forms MC-351 and MC-355, which must be amended.
