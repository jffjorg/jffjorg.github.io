And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion of counsel, Nathalie E. Corral and Ashley A. Laiken, to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff Maliyah McKnight. The motion was denied because the proof of service was defective, and the Lexis Nexis search used to confirm the plaintiff's address was not sufficient. The judge ordered counsel to correct the defects and attempt the methods listed in the motion to be relieved. Since the current motion was not corrected, the judge denied the motion.
