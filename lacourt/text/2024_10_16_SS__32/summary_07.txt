And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for an order compelling Defendant Target Corporation to produce additional TruCase reports. The motion was brought by Plaintiffs Brayden Medina Molina and Joo Hye Song, who sought to compel production of individual reports for 20 additional incidents identified from an Excel sheet provided by Defendant. Defendant opposed the motion, arguing that producing individual reports would not provide new information and that the Court's prior order only required production of records contained in the TruCase system. The Court granted the motion, finding that Defendant had complied with the Court's prior order but that the Plaintiffs' representation that the Excel spreadsheet was not "reasonably usable" justified compelling production of individual reports. The Court declined to award sanctions, as Defendant had substantial justification for refusing to produce the reports.
