The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel further responses to the request for production of documents, set three, numbers 49 and 50. The plaintiff failed to provide timely responses to the request, and the judge finds that the privilege against forced disclosure of tax returns has been waived. The judge also notes that the plaintiff is currently self-represented and that the defendant did not provide adequate notice of the motion. Nevertheless, the motion is granted, and the plaintiff is ordered to provide further responses to the request.
