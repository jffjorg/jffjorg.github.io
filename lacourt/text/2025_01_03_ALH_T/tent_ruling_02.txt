BACKGROUND
 
On July 10, 2024, Plaintiff Elpidio Rios (“Plaintiff”) filed the
operative first amended complaint (“FAC”) alleging negligence based on a construction
site injury near the intersection of La Cienega and Jefferson Boulevards in Los
Angeles. Specially, Plaintiff alleges that on January 24, 2020, he was working
for a subcontractor that was hired by some or all of Defendants, to perform
certain work at the premises. On that day, Plaintiff was walking on the
premises when an unsecured piece of plywood slipped out underneath him, causing
him to fall through an opening 12 feet high. (FAC, ¶ 27-28.)
 
Defendants are entities that are alleged to own and
operate the subject premises and construction project. (FAC, ¶ 17-18.) 
 
            Defendants CP V Cumulus, LLC, Carmel
Partners Inc., CP Construction West Inc., Carmel Management, LLC, MWL
Solutions, Inc., and Mario William Larrabure dba MWL General Contracting
(“Defendants”) now demur to the FAC. Plaintiff opposes and Defendants reply. 
 
MOVING PARTY POSITION
 
Defendants demur to the FAC
arguing that the alleged facts show the action is barred by the Privette
doctrine and workers’ compensation exclusivity. Defendants argue the FAC does
not sufficiently allege that Defendants retained control of the site or that
there were concealed hazards under the Privette exceptions.  
 
OPPOSITION
            
            Plaintiff first argues that an
affirmative defense such as the Privette doctrine, cannot be raised in a
demurrer. Next, Plaintiff argues the FAC does not allege that Defendants hired
Plaintiff’s employer, and therefore, it cannot be determined from the pleadings
that Privette applies. Finally, Plaintiff argues the FAC sufficient
alleges the Privette exceptions. 
 
REPLY
 
            Again,
Defendants argue that Plaintiff alleges insufficient facts of the Privette
exceptions.            
ANALYSIS
I.                  
Demurrer
Legal Standard
The
primary function of a pleading is to give the other party notice so that it may
prepare its case [citation], and a defect in a pleading that otherwise properly
notifies a party cannot be said to affect substantial rights.” (Harris v.
City of Santa Monica (2013) 56 Cal.4th 203, 240.) “A demurrer tests
the legal sufficiency of the factual allegations in a complaint.” (Ivanoff
v. Bank of America, N.A. (2017) 9
Cal.App.5th 719, 725.) It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or
content of the opposing party's pleading (complaint, answer or
cross-complaint).  (Code Civ. Proc. §§
422.10, 589; see Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th
968, 994.)  It is not the function of the
demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for purposes of
the ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are assumed to
be true.  (Donabedian, 116
Cal.App.4th at 994.)
The general rule is that
the plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts, not evidentiary facts. (Doe
v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550.) “All that is required
of a plaintiff, as a matter of pleading, even as against a special demurrer, is
that his complaint set forth the essential facts of the case with reasonable
precision and with sufficient particularity to acquaint the defendant with the
nature, source and extent of his cause of action.” (Rannard v. Lockheed
Aircraft Corp. (1945) 26 Cal.2d 149, 156-157.)
A
demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable.  (Blank v. Kirwan
(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian, supra, 116 Cal.App.4th at
994.)  No other extrinsic evidence can be
considered.  (Ion Equip. Corp. v.
Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 881 [error for court to consider facts
asserted in memorandum supporting demurrer]; see also Afuso v. United States
Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862 [disapproved on other
grounds in Moradi-Shalal v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d
287] [error to consider contents of release not part of court record].) A
demurrer can be utilized where the “face of the complaint” itself is incomplete
or discloses some defense that would bar recovery.  (Guardian North Bay, Inc. v. Superior
Court (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 963, 971-72.) 

 
II.               
Request for
Judicial Notice
The Court grants Defendant’s request
for judicial notice of exhibit 1, the FAC in this case. (Evid. Code, § 452,
subd. (d).) 
III.            
Meet and
Confer
Code
of Civil Procedure section 430.41 requires that “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the
demurring party shall meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by video
conference with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer
for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would
resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41, subd. (a).) The parties are to meet and confer at least five days
before the date the responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41,
subd. (a)(2).) Thereafter, the demurring party shall file and serve a
declaration detailing their meet and confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41, subd. (a)(3).)
The Declaration of Amar M. Hatti,
Defendants’ counsel, states the following: “[o]n August 23, 2024, I telephoned
the attorney for plaintiff Elpidio Rios, Christopher Ghahreman. We met and
conferred regarding the second amended complaint in this matter and the basis
for the concurrently-filed demurrer, including application of the Privette
doctrine. We could not come to an agreement on the demurrer.” (Hatti Decl., ¶ 2.)

Therefore, the meet and confer
requirement is met. 
IV.            
Privette Doctrine
Ordinarily, the person hiring an independent contractor is
not liable to the contractor's employees for workplace injuries.¿ The
independent contractor's employer's liability for such injuries is limited by
workers' compensation, as is the liability of the party who hired the
contractor.¿ (Privette v. Superior Court (1993) 5 Cal.4th 689, 693,
700-02; Camargo v. Tjaarda Dairy (2001) 25 Cal.4th 1235, 1244-1245; Toland
v. Sunland Housing Group, Inc. (1998) 18 Cal.4th 253, 264-70.)¿¿ 
¿¿ 
The Supreme Court has held that it would be unfair to
impose liability on the hiring person when the liability of the contractor, the
one primarily responsible for its worker’s on-the-job injuries, is limited to
providing workers’ compensation coverage.¿ As such, even if there is evidence
that the hirer was directly liable for the plaintiff’s injuries, recovery is
not available under the peculiar risk doctrine.¿ (Privette, supra,
5 Cal.4th at 693, 700-02.)¿¿ 
¿¿ 
Workers’
compensation “ ‘is the exclusive remedy against an employer for injury or death
of an employee.’ [Citation.]” … In Privette, the Supreme Court held that
“an independent contractor’s employee should not be allowed to recover damages
from the contractor’s hirer, who ‘is indirectly paying for the cost of
[workers’ compensation] coverage, which the [hired] contractor presumably has
calculated into the contract price.’ [Citation.]” [Citation.]¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
The
Privette holding was based on the principle that the hirer of an independent
contractor generally has “ ‘ “ ‘no right of control as to the mode of doing the
work contracted for.’ ” ’ ” [Citation.] Precisely because the hirer “has no
obligation to specify the precautions an independent hired contractor should
take for the safety of the contractor’s employees, ... [a]bsent an obligation,
there can be no liability in tort.” [Citation.]¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
(Alvarez v. Seaside Transportation Services LLC
(2017) 13 Cal.App.5th 635, 640.)¿ Moreover, “[t]he Privette line of decisions
establishes a presumption that an independent contractor’s hirer ‘delegates to
that contractor its tort law duty to provide a safe workplace for the
contractor’s employees.’ [Citation.]”¿ (Id. at 642.)¿In SeaBright Ins. Co.
v. US Airways, Inc. (2011) 52 Cal.4th 590, “the Supreme Court extended Privette
to service contracts, [holding] that the duty to provide a safe working
environment is implicitly and presumptively delegated in all independent
contractor agreements.” (Vargas v. FMI, Inc. (2015) 233 Cal.App.4th 638,
645.)  
 
A.               
Exceptions
to Privette
The California Supreme Court has identified two limited
circumstances to overcome the presumption under Privette. (Gonzalez
v. Mathis (2021) 12 Cal.5th 29, 38.)
 “First, in Hooker
v. Department of Transportation (2002) 27 Cal.4th 198, 115 Cal.Rptr.2d 853,
38 P.3d 1081 (Hooker), [the Court] held that a hirer may be liable when
it retains control over any part of the independent contractor's work and
negligently exercises that retained control in a manner that affirmatively
contributes to the worker's injury. [Citation.] Second, in Kinsman v. Unocal Corp. (2005) 37 Cal.4th 659, 36
Cal.Rptr.3d 495, 123 P.3d 931 (Kinsman), [the Court] held that a
landowner who hires an independent contractor may be liable if the landowner
knew, or should have known, of a concealed hazard on the property that the
contractor did not know of and could not have reasonably discovered, and the
landowner failed to warn the contractor of the hazard. [Citation.]” 
(Gonzalez, supra, 12
Cal.5th at p. 38.)  
V.               
Discussion
Here, the FAC states the following
relevant allegations:
“On or about January 24, 2020,
Plaintiff was working for a subcontractor (hired by some or all Defendants) to
perform certain work at the Premises.” (FAC, ¶ 27.) “[A]t all relevant times
alleged herein, Defendants actively participated in and/or retained control
over the construction, installation, assembly, erection, design, modification,
repair, management, supervision, monitoring, control, inspection safety and/or
maintenance of the Premises, including, without limitation, the improvements
and structures therein, the subject wood flooring, and the area where Plaintiff
was injured.” (Id., ¶ 29.) Plaintiff alleges Defendants retained control
because they “supervised and managed the construction and collaborated
seamlessly every step of the way in construction”. (Id.) 
Furthermore, the FAC alleges: “[t]he
hazardous and unsafe condition of the subject wood flooring, Plaintiff’s work site
and the Premises was latent and/or concealed in that their dangerous nature was
not apparent to the Plaintiff or other persons similarly situated.” (FAC, ¶
38.) “Defendants knew, or should have known, that such condition of the subject
wood flooring/deck was unsafe and dangerous, and failed to take reasonable
safety precautions or to provide adequate warnings or safeguards to prevent
injury to the Plaintiff and others.” (Id., ¶ 42.)
First, Plaintiff fails to show that
an affirmative defense cannot be the basis for a demurrer, especially given
that Plaintiff cites cases involving demurrers on a statute of limitations
defense. (See Opp., 4; Committee for Green Foothills v. Santa Clara County
Bd. of Supervisors (2010) 48 Cal.4th 32, 42; Marshall v. Gibson, Dunn
& Crutcher (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1397, 1403].) 
Second, Plaintiff argues the face of
the FAC does not show that Defendants hired Plaintiff’s employer. However,
Plaintiff insufficiently explains how the allegation that “Plaintiff was
working for a subcontractor (hired by some or all Defendants) to perform
certain work at the Premises” (FAC, ¶ 27) precludes Privette. Based on
this allegation, Plaintiff falls under the Privette doctrine because he worked
for a subcontractor hired to perform work. (See Tverberg v. Fillner
Construction, Inc. (2010) 49 Cal.4th 518, 528-29 [barring recovery for independent
contractor hired by subcontractor]; Toland, supra, 18 Cal.4th at
p. 270 [barring recovery for employee of subcontractor].)
Here, the FAC fails to specifically
state facts that Defendants negligently exercised control over Plaintiff’s work,
which affirmatively created or contributed to Plaintiff’s fall from the
unsecured plywood.  On the issue of the concealed
hazard exception to the Privette doctrine, which appears to be
the theory pursued, as noted above, it applies if the hirer failed to warn of a
hazard of which it knew, or should have known, the contractor did not know of
the hazard, and the contractor could not have reasonably discovered this
hazardous condition. (Kinsman, supra, 37 Cal.4th 659 at 664, fn.
omitted.)  Under this exception, the
hirer’s delegation of tort duties can be seen as “ineffective” because the
independent contractor cannot protect its workers against a hazard it does not
know about and could not reasonably discover. 
(Sandoval v. Qualcomm Incorporated (2021) 12 Cal.5th 256, 271.)  Here, the FAC does not sufficiently allege
facts that Defendants had knowledge of, or should have known of the unsecured
plywood, and that it was not readily apparent to Plaintiff or the subcontractor
he was working for.    
Therefore, because the FAC states
insufficient facts of the Hooker and Kinsman exceptions, the
demurrer is sustained with leave to amend. 
RULING
Defendants’ demurrer is SUSTAINED
WITH 20 DAYS LEAVE TO AMEND.
