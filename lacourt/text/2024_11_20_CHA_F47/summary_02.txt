And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling states that attorney Dennis Russell has filed a motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiffs Nicole A. Parke, E.O.A. Global Holdings, LLC, and E.O.A. Management Group, LLC. The motion was served on defense counsel and clients by email and mail, but did not include email addresses. The Judge notes that notice of the motion was not served on claimant River Wuhai LLC, and it is questionable whether service on the claimant is required. If defense counsel does not object to the motion, it will be granted and a copy of the signed order will be served on all parties. If defense counsel objects, the matter will be placed off calendar for failure to properly serve the motion.
