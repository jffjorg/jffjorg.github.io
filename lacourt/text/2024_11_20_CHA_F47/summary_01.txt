And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the State of California's motion to consolidate two cases, Joseph Carnes; Samantha Bibian v. State of California, acting by and through its Department of Parks and Recreation; Ana Alexis Garcia; Ana M. Roque Rivas; CVIN, LLC and Does 1-30, inclusive (LASC Case No. 23CHCV00493) and Christopher Armstrong; Consuelo Pereida v. State of California, acting by and through its Department of Parks and Recreation; Ana Alexis Garcia; Ana Roque Rivas; CVIN, LLC (LASC Case No. 23CHCV01454). The two cases arise from a common set of facts and present common questions of law and fact, making consolidation warranted and necessary to promote trial convenience and economy. The Judge notes that the only factual difference between the two cases is that the Carnes Complaint dropped all claims against the County of Los Angeles, which was later dismissed from both cases. As a result, the County of Los Angeles is no longer a party in either case. The hearing on the motion to consolidate is scheduled for November 20, 2024.
