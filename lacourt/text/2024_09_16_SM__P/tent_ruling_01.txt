Mahmood Michael Amin et al. v. Adel Ahadi, et al., Case No. 21SMCV00348
Hearing Date: September 16, 2024 
Plaintiff Amin’s Motions to Compel (1) Deposition of Defendants Adel
Ahadi and Tahmineh Davoodi Askar; (2) Responses by Adel Ahadi to Special
interrogatories (Set One); (3) Responses by Adel Ahadi to Special Request for
Identification and Production of Documents (Set One); and for Monetary
Sanctions 
 
Amin brings a breach of contract claim against defendants Ahadi and
Askar, alleging failure to repay money owed for two loans totaling $40,000. On July
12, 2023 Ahadi was served with Amin’s special interrogatories, and both Ahadi
and Askar with his request for production. Amin also served Ahadi and Askar
with notice of continued depositions. Amin moves for an order compelling Ahadi
to serve written responses to his discovery request and compel the depositions
of Ahadi and Askar. No opposition has been filed. 
 
Per Amin’s counsel declaration, the court encouraged and brokered a
deposition schedule, agreed by the parties, for Ahadi and Askar’s deposition.
Jen Decl ¶4. Amin served both Ahadi and Askar with notice of their continued
deposition on December 19, 2023, then respectively scheduled for January 22-23,
2024. Id. ¶¶5-6.
Neither Ahadi nor Askar appeared for their respective depositions. Id. ¶10. Counsel
served an updated notice of continued deposition for Ahadi and Askar to be held
on September 30, 2024 and October 1, 2024. Id. ¶11.
 
Similarly, counsel avers that on July 12, 2023, he served Ahadi and
Askar with written discovery. Id. ¶¶12-14; Exh. F-H. Ahadi and Askar have not served responses. Id. ¶¶15-16. Based
on this, the motions are proper under CCP §§ 2025.450, 2030.290, and 2031.300. 
 
Amin requests $1,479.50 in monetary sanctions against Ahadi and Askar
for the 3.34 hours spent preparing and arguing the motion, at a rate of $425.00
per hour, and $60.00 for the filing fee. The court finds the amount reasonable
and orders it payable
within 30 days. GRANTED.
