And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motions brought by the plaintiff, Mahmood Michael Amin, to compel the defendants, Adel Ahadi and Tahmineh Davoodi Askar, to serve written responses to discovery requests and to appear for depositions. The court finds that the motions are proper under California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.450, 2030.290, and 2031.300, as the defendants have failed to serve written responses to discovery requests and have failed to appear for their scheduled depositions. The court orders the defendants to serve written responses to the discovery requests and to appear for their depositions. Additionally, the court grants the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,479.50, payable within 30 days, due to the defendants' failure to comply with the discovery requests and their failure to appear for their scheduled depositions.
