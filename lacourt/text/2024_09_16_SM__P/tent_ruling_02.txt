LLC’s Request for Admissions Deemed Admitted
Motion to Compel Responses to Request for Production
Motion to Compel Responses to Interrogatories and Request for Sanctions

 
Plaintiff landlord Princess Apts. LLC filed this unlawful detainer
action for nonpayment of rent. On June 10, 2024 plaintiff served Request for
Admissions, Request for Production, Form Interrogatories and Special
Interrogatories. As of the date of filing, defendant has not served responses
or requests for further extensions, and Princess Apts. moves for an order
deeming the requests admitted pursuant to C.C.P. § 2033.280, compelling defendant’s
responses to RFPs, FROGS and SCROGS, and for $2,207.74 in sanctions. No
opposition has been filed. 
 
Princess Apts.’ counsel propounded discovery on June 10, 2024 to
defense counsel. Nussbaum Decl. ¶2; Exh. A. More than 30 days have elapsed
without responses; defendant failed to respond as of August 14, 2024. Id. ¶3. Defendant
does not file opposition. Based on this, the motions are proper under C.C.P. §§
2030.290, 2031.300 and 2033.280. 
 
Princess Apts. requests $2,207.74 in sanctions for each of the three motions,
for 2.5 hours preparing each motion, 2 hours reviewing opposition, and for the
appearance at a rate of $475.00, plus $70.24 for the filing fees. Nussbaum
Decl. ¶ 5. The amounts requested are excessive, given the simplicity of the
motions and lack of opposition. The court awards a total of five hours for
preparation and appearance at $475/hour, plus $70.24 for filing fees, payable
within 30 days. GRANTED.
