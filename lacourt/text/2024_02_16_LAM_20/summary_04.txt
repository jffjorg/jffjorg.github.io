And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case filed by Brian Yang and Jerry Xu against Michel Amar, Alec Amar, Bit.Management, LLC, NYAM, LLC, and Multiple Application Technology, LLC. The case involves claims of breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, and other related claims. The Court has denied the Motion to Compel filed by Yang, which sought to compel non-party Bit Mining International, LLC to comply with a business record subpoena. The Court found that Yang did not provide sufficient evidence to show how he learned of the transfer of ownership of miners and customer contracts from Bit.Management LLC to BM, and that a separate statement was only provided with the Reply brief, making it impossible for the respondent to respond. The Court also declined to award sanctions against Yang. The parties are encouraged to submit on the tentative, and if they do not, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
