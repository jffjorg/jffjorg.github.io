As such, it is necessary to obtain additional information from BM relating to the Transfer, and to determine the scope of the customer relationships in support of Yang's claim for damages.”The subpoena at issue seeks financial documents. The Motion to Compel is denied without prejudice because (1) a separate statement was only provided with the Reply brief such that a response could not be provided if desired and (2) Yang did not cite any evidence showing how exactly he learned that a transfer was made to the non-party, which would be necessary to show good cause for the subject discovery.   The Court declines to award sanctions.Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
