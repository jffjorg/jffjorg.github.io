And here is the English-text summary:

In this tentative ruling, Judge [Judge's Name] considers a motion by Romana Chowdhury's attorney, Stephen Madoni, to be relieved as counsel. Madoni claims that there has been an irremedible breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, making it impossible for him to continue representing Chowdhury. He also asserts that Chowdhury is not making required payments under their agreement. Despite these claims, the motion is denied without prejudice because Madoni failed to provide proof of service on Chowdhury or all other parties involved in the case. The parties had previously stipulated to submit the matter to arbitration, and the court retains jurisdiction only to hear motions related to arbitration. Madoni is ordered to give notice, and parties who intend to submit on the tentative must email the court indicating their intention.
