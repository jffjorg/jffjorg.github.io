And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories filed by the plaintiff, Claire Stanford, against defendants The Palisades Association, Inc., Long Beach Home Solutions, Inc., Boris Bogomolny, and Renee Bogomolny. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants' responses to the special interrogatories are insufficient and seeks to compel further responses and impose sanctions. The defendants argue that the motion should be denied because the notice was improper, the meet and confer efforts were insufficient, and the responses are sufficient. The judge finds that the plaintiff failed to attach the defendants' correspondence to the moving papers, which indicates that the responses are sufficient, and assumes that the plaintiff concedes the merits of the motion. The judge will deny the motion unless the plaintiff appears at the hearing and indicates that she does not concede the merits of the motion, in which case the judge will continue the hearing to require the parties to engage in meet and confer efforts. The judge also orders the plaintiff to give notice and sets out the procedures for parties to submit on the tentative ruling.
