Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint and has issued a tentative ruling. The parties were originally scheduled to meet and confer before the hearing, but did not do so. As a result, the judge continued the hearing and ordered the parties to meet and confer at the defense counsel's office and provide a joint statement on the status of the pleading challenge. The parties have since met and conferred and agreed to amend the complaint to address the deficiencies identified in the judge's order. The plaintiff needs additional time to draft and file the amended complaint, and the defendant will respond to it in the statutory time. The judge has scheduled a case management conference to hear from the plaintiff on the amount of time needed to draft and file the amended complaint.
