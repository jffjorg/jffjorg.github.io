Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to sever or bifurcate the trial. The defendant had sought to have his affirmative defenses, including statute of limitations, lack of subject matter jurisdiction, res judicata, and collateral estoppel, tried separately from the main case. However, the judge found that the defendant's motion lacked any meaningful discussion of the factors that would favor or oppose bifurcation or severance. Additionally, the judge noted that the same witnesses, facts, and evidence would be considered in connection with the affirmative defenses as the main case, making bifurcation not in the interest of justice. The judge also denied the defendant's request for a "hearing" in advance of the trial date, stating that such a hearing is not permitted.
