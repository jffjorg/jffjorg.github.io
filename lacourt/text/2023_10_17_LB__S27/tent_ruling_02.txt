 Case Number:  21LBCV00462    Hearing Date:   October 17, 2023    Dept:  S27  
1.     Motion
to Be Relieved as Counsel
Plaintiff, Romana Chowdhury’s
attorney of record, Stephen Madoni, moves to be relieved as counsel.  Counsel declares there has been an
irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, such that further
representation is not possible.  He also
declares Plaintiff is not making required payments under the parties’
agreement.  
 
The motion is denied without
prejudice because there is no proof of service on Plaintiff or on all parties
who have appeared in the action.  Additionally,
the parties stipulated to submit this entire matter to arbitration on 10/21/21.  This Court, at this time, retains jurisdiction
only to hear a motion to confirm, vacate, or modify any arbitration award.  Counsel must seek any other relief from the
arbitrator, not the Court.  
 
Plaintiff’s attorney is ordered to give notice.  
 
Parties who intend to submit
on this tentative must send an email to the court at gdcdepts27@lacourt.org indicating intention to submit on the tentative as
directed by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department
does not receive an email indicating the parties are submitting on the tentative
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion may be placed off calendar.  If a party submits on the tentative, the
party’s email must include the case number and must identify the party
submitting on the tentative. If any party does not submit on the tentative, the
party should make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing on this matter.
