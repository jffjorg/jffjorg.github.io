And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Escrow L.A.'s motion to order the deposit of interpleaded funds with the Clerk of the Court. Escrow L.A. holds $531,682.68 in an escrow account and has no interest in the funds. The parties have not mutually agreed on instructions for distribution, and Escrow L.A. seeks to deposit the funds with the court. The judge found that Escrow L.A. made a prima facie showing that it is entitled to interplead the funds under California Code of Civil Procedure §386.5. The court has not received opposition to the motion, and therefore, it is granted. However, the court declines to award attorneys' fees and costs to Escrow L.A. because it did not provide adequate notice to all parties of the relief sought. The parties are directed to submit on the tentative ruling by email, and if they do not, they should arrange to appear remotely at the hearing.
