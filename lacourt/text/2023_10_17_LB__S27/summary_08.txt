And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendant, Martha Diaz, against the plaintiff, Martha Valdez. The plaintiff's First Amended Complaint alleges that the defendant fraudulently transferred her property and seeks relief for quiet title, declaratory and injunctive relief, intentional misrepresentation (fraud), elder abuse, willful concealment, constructive fraud, negligence, and breach of fiduciary duty. The defendant argues that the complaint fails to state a cause of action due to the statute of frauds and statute of limitations, contradictory allegations, and causes of action that fail to state a cause of action.

The judge finds that the plaintiff's opposition to the demurrer and motion to strike fails to address the defendant's arguments and that the plaintiff must address all the arguments made in the demurrer and motion to strike if she wishes her causes of action to survive the pleading attack. The judge has continued the hearing to November 21, 2023, and ordered the plaintiff to file a new opposition to the demurrer and motion to strike and the defendant to file any reply.
