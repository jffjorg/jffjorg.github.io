 Case Number:  22LBCV00198    Hearing Date:   October 17, 2023    Dept:  S27 Plaintiffs and Defendants entered
into a signed settlement agreement in late April of 2023.  On 6/22/23, because Defendants were in breach
of the agreement, the Court issued an order enforcing the agreement and reducing
the agreement to a judgment pursuant to CCP §664.6.      
 
On 9/20/23, Plaintiffs filed this
motion for attorneys’ fees.  Plaintiffs seek
to recover fees incurred in connection with the motion to enforce the
settlement and the instant motion for attorneys’ fees.  Plaintiffs cite Alioto Fish C. v. Alioto
(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 1669, 1687, wherein the Court held that contract-based
attorneys’ fees are properly awarded when a party is required to make and
successfully does make a motion to enforce settlement pursuant to §664.6.  Plaintiffs show that the parties’ contract
contains an attorneys’ fees provision, such that an award of fees is
appropriate.
 
Any opposition to the motion was
due on or before 10/04/23.  The Court has
not received timely opposition to the motion, and will not consider late-filed
opposition papers.  
 
Plaintiffs seek to recover $5200 in
attorneys’ fees and $225.45 in costs.  The
Court has reviewed the declaration in support of the motion and finds the
amounts reasonable, with the exception of the anticipated 1.5 hours to review the
opposition to this motion and prepare reply papers.  Because no opposition was filed, no review or
reply was necessary.  The Court therefore
reduces the total amount of fees from $5200 to $4600 (reduction of 1.5 hours at
rate of $400/hour).  The Court awards
$4825.45 in attorneys’ fees and costs, and will interlineate the 7/05/23 judgment
accordingly.  
 
Plaintiffs are ordered to give notice.
