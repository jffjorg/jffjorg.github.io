And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a hearing on October 17, 2023. The case involves a dispute between plaintiff Heather Szafranski and defendant Michael Hollinghurst and his company, Network Financial Service. The crux of the complaint is that plaintiff signed a promissory note with defendant, but believed the transaction was canceled; defendant, in violation of the parties' agreement, filed the deed of trust on the property. The court issued a default judgment in favor of plaintiff and against defendant, declaring the deed of trust void and requiring defendant to cancel the note and deed of trust.

The court has several concerns with plaintiff's ex parte application for a temporary restraining order and request for OSC re: preliminary injunction. The court finds that the judgment already provides the relief requested, and that a preliminary injunction would be unnecessary. The court also notes that the parties' default judgment proceeding is unclear regarding whether defendant is permitted to participate in the matter.

The court will continue the OSC re: preliminary injunction to November 9, 2023, and will also set an OSC re: resolving the temporary restraining order for the same date and time. The court orders plaintiff to give notice and permits defendant to file a brief and any evidence in opposition to the OSC.
