And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendant, Johnnie Miller, against the plaintiff, Jazikio Carter. The plaintiff filed a breach of contract claim, alleging that the defendant failed to repair a water leak in his apartment. The defendant argues that the plaintiff's complaint is insufficient, as it does not provide sufficient details about the water leak and the breach of contract.

The judge notes that the parties must meet and confer in good faith to resolve the demurrer. The judge also advises the plaintiff to retain an attorney, as the defendant has numerous motions on calendar in the near future, and rulings on those motions could seriously affect the plaintiff's ability to prosecute his action against the defendant.

The judge continues the hearing to 12/12/23, to be heard concurrently with the defendant's scheduled discovery motions. The parties must meet and confer by telephone or in person within the next two weeks, and if they are unable to agree on a Second Amended Complaint, they must file briefs and declarations at least two weeks prior to the continued hearing date.
