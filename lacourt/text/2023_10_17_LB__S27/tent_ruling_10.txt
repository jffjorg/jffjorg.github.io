 Case Number:  23LBCV00675    Hearing Date:   October 17, 2023    Dept:  S27  The Court was originally scheduled
to hear Defendants’ demurrer to Plaintiff’s complaint on 9/14/23.  Prior to the hearing, the Court issued a
detailed tentative ruling indicating the parties had not met and conferred, continuing
the hearing to require them to do so, and providing guidance to assist in the meet
and confer efforts.  At the conclusion of
the hearing, the Court adopted its tentative ruling, ordered the parties to
meet and confer at Defense Counsel’s office on 9/21/23, and ordered the parties
to submit a joint statement concerning the status of the pleading challenge by
10/09/23.  

 

On 10/04/23, the parties provided a
status report concerning their meet and confer efforts.  The parties met and conferred in person on
9/21/23, and Plaintiff agreed to amend her complaint to address the
deficiencies detailed in the 9/14/23 order. 
The parties have agreed that Plaintiff needs an unspecified amount of
additional time to draft and file her FAC, and that Defendant will respond in the
statutory time thereafter to the FAC.

 

There is a CMC on calendar
concurrently with the hearing on the demurrer today.  At the CMC, the Court wishes to hear from Plaintiff
concerning the amount of time she needs to draft and file her FAC.
