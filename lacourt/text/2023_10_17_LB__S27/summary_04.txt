And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for attorneys' fees filed by the Plaintiffs. The Plaintiffs seek to recover $5200 in attorneys' fees and $225.45 in costs related to the motion to enforce the settlement agreement and the instant motion for attorneys' fees. The settlement agreement was entered into in April 2023, but the Defendants breached the agreement, leading to an order enforcing the agreement and reducing it to a judgment in June 2023. The Plaintiffs cite a previous court decision, Alioto Fish C. v. Alioto (1994), which held that contract-based attorneys' fees are properly awarded when a party is required to make and successfully does make a motion to enforce a settlement. The Court has reviewed the declaration in support of the motion and finds the amounts reasonable, with the exception of 1.5 hours to review the opposition and prepare reply papers, which is not necessary since no opposition was filed. The Court reduces the total amount of fees from $5200 to $4600 and awards $4825.45 in attorneys' fees and costs. The Court will interlineate the judgment accordingly.
