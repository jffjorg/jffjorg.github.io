And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by the defendant to reclassify the case to a limited jurisdiction matter. The defendant argues that the amount in controversy does not exceed $35,000, which is the jurisdictional limit for a limited jurisdiction case. The plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that the amount in controversy may exceed $25,000, which is the jurisdictional limit for a superior court.

The judge notes that the defendant's argument is based on the current version of CCP section 86(a)(1), which increased the jurisdictional minimum from $25,000 to $35,000 on January 1, 2024. However, the judge applies the $25,000 minimum because the statute does not include any express language indicating that the new jurisdictional minimum was intended to apply retroactively.

The judge also notes that the plaintiff's discovery responses suggest that the amount in controversy may exceed $25,000. The plaintiff has claimed general damages, which are not subject to precise measurement, and may require future treatment. Therefore, the judge cannot grant the motion with a high level of certainty that the damage award will not exceed $25,000.

As a result, the judge denies the motion to reclassify the case to a limited jurisdiction matter.
