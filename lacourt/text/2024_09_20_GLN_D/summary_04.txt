And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Lin v. Dang, et al. The defendant, Arcadia Mental Health Center, had filed a demurrer against the original complaint. However, the original complaint has been superseded by a First Amended Complaint filed on August 30, 2024. As a result, the demurrer is taken off calendar as moot. The judge reminds the parties of their obligations under California Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41 (a) to meet and confer before filing a demurrer to an amended pleading. The judge also encourages parties to make arrangements for audio or video appearances through LACourtConnect, a free service offered by the court. If no appearance is set up, the court will assume the parties are submitting on the tentative ruling.
