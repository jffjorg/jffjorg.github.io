 Case Number:  24LBCV01602    Hearing Date:   January 14, 2025    Dept:  S27 Plaintiff has motions to compel
further responses scheduled on 1/14/25, 1/21/25, and 1/23/25.  The Court is continuing the hearing on the
1/14/25 and 1/21/25 motions to 1/23/25 so all three motions can be heard
together.  
 
The Court has reviewed Defendant’s
12/30/24 opposition to the 1/14/25 motion. 
It appears Defendant has supplemented responses and Plaintiff refused to
permit Defendant an extension of time, during the holiday season, to do without
the need for law and motion practice.  
 
The parties must continue to meet
and confer to resolve any outstanding issues. 
If issues remain unresolved, the parties must file a joint statement of
items in dispute at least seven court days prior to the 1/23/25 continued
hearing date.  The joint statement must
be one document, filed jointly by both parties to the dispute.  Pursuant to CCP §§2023.300, 2031.310, and
2033.290, if the statement would otherwise be voluminous, the Court asks the
parties to provide a concise outline of matters remaining in dispute rather
than a joint statement or each individual item in dispute.  The statement must list each item in dispute
(or category of items), Defendant’s most recent response to that item, and each
party’s statement of why the response is or is not sufficient.  If sanctions remain at issue, they must also
be discussed in the joint statement.  
 
Plaintiff is ordered to give
notice.  
 
Parties who intend to submit
on this tentative must send an email to the court at gdcdepts27@lacourt.org indicating intention to submit on the tentative
as directed by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department
does not receive an email indicating the parties are submitting on the
tentative and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion may be placed
off calendar.  If a party submits on
the tentative, the party’s email must include the case number and must identify
the party submitting on the tentative.  If
the parties do not submit on the tentative, they should arrange to appear
remotely.
