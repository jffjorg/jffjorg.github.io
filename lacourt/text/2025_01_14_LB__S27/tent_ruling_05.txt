 Case Number:  23LBCV02010    Hearing Date:   January 14, 2025    Dept:  S27 1.    
Background Facts
Plaintiff, Yusen Terminals LLC initiated this action against Defendant,
Loko AI, Inc. on 10/23/23.  The complaint
is for breach of contract and related claims. 
On 3/14/24, Defendant responded to the complaint by filing an answer and
a cross-complaint.  The cross-complaint
is also for breach of contract and related claims.    
 
2.     Motion to Strike Cross-Complaint and Answer 
Plaintiff establishes, through its
request for judicial notice (which is granted), that Defendant is a suspended
corporation.  Pursuant to Crestmar Owners
Association v. Stapakis (2007) 157 Cal.App. 4th 1223, 1230, a
suspended corporation cannot prosecute or defend itself in a civil
lawsuit.  In the absence of opposition,
the Court finds Defendant and Cross-Complainant does not intend to seek
revivor, and therefore the request to strike its cross-complaint and answer is
granted.
 
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice.
