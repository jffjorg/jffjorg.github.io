The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike the cross-complaint and answer filed by Loko AI, Inc. (the defendant). The plaintiff, Yusen Terminals LLC, had requested that the court strike the cross-complaint and answer based on the fact that Loko AI, Inc. is a suspended corporation and therefore cannot prosecute or defend itself in a civil lawsuit, as per the case law of Crestmar Owners Association v. Stapakis (2007). The judge has granted the motion, finding that Loko AI, Inc. does not intend to seek revivor and therefore cannot continue to prosecute or defend itself in the lawsuit. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to give notice of the ruling. Parties who wish to submit on the tentative ruling must email the court by the specified deadline, indicating their intention to do so. If no one submits on the tentative, the motion may be placed off calendar.
