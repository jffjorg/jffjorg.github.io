This is a tentative ruling from a Judge regarding a case scheduled for hearing on January 14, 2025. The case was originally scheduled for December 12, 2024, but was continued to January 14, 2025, with the parties ordered to meet and confer and file a joint statement of items in dispute. However, the parties failed to file the joint statement, and the Judge has taken the motion off calendar. The Judge has also set a Case Management Conference for April 3, 2025, and has continued three motions to compel to that date. The Judge encourages the parties to make best efforts to resolve their discovery issues so that the motions do not need to go forward.
