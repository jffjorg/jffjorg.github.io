Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to continue the trial in this case. The parties have been discussing the environmental investigation and testing of the property, and Foasberg has been diligently pursuing discovery. However, the judge is concerned that the delays are causing difficulties and uncertainties in the case.

The judge notes that the trial has been continued multiple times without opposition, and Foasberg has been adequately diligent prior to the 4/22/24 continuance. However, the judge is concerned that Foasberg's indication that testing during the "wet" season is necessary may be uncertain, given the current drought.

The judge is satisfied with Foasberg's showing that the five-year statute will not be affected by a continuance to 8/29/25, but is concerned that the delays may be causing difficulties and uncertainties in the case. The judge is asking the parties to make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing on the motion and to be prepared to discuss the timeline for preparing the case for trial, as well as what a trial would look like if testing were not complete.
