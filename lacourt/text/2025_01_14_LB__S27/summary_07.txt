And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the defendant's opposition to the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses and has decided to continue the hearing to January 23, 2025. The parties must continue to meet and confer to resolve any outstanding issues. If issues remain unresolved, the parties must file a joint statement of items in dispute at least seven court days prior to the continued hearing date. The joint statement must list each item in dispute, the defendant's most recent response, and each party's statement of why the response is or is not sufficient. The court also reminds the parties to provide a concise outline of matters remaining in dispute rather than a lengthy joint statement. If sanctions remain at issue, they must also be discussed in the joint statement. The parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit as directed by the court's website. If the department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion may be placed off calendar.
