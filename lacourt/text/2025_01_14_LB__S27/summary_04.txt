And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case 23LBCV01255, filed by plaintiff Eric Cleveland against defendants Cancun Properties LLC, Anjai Savire LLC, and Sirenitas Restaurant, Inc. The case revolves around alleged violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Uniform Accessibility Act (UNRUH) due to the defendants' property being in violation of these laws.

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the complaint to add allegations concerning nonconformities discovered by an expert examination of the defendant's property. The amended complaint was filed on September 24, 2024, but was mistakenly marked as "filed" instead of "lodged," and is therefore deemed filed as of the hearing date.

The judge has scheduled a hearing on six discovery motions on February 13, 2025, and has ordered the parties to meet and confer in good faith to resolve their discovery disputes. If the parties are unable to do so, the court will likely appoint a discovery referee to rule on the motions. The judge has also scheduled an OSC (Order to Show Cause) regarding the appointment of a discovery referee for the same date.

The judge reminds the parties that a responsive pleading must be filed by the defendant within 20 days of the hearing date, and that if no responsive pleading is filed, the answer to the original complaint will be deemed the answer to the amended complaint.
