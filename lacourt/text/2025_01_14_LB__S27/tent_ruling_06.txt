 Case Number:  24LBCV00861    Hearing Date:   January 14, 2025    Dept:  S27 This Court was originally scheduled
to hear this motion on 12/12/24.  Prior
to the hearing, the Court issued a tentative ruling continuing the hearing
until 1/14/25, ordering the parties to meet and confer, and ordering the parties
to file a joint statement of items in dispute at least seven court days prior
to the continued hearing date if they failed to resolve their issues.  
 
The parties have not filed a joint
statement of items in dispute, and therefore the Court takes the motion off
calendar.  
 
The Court notes that the only
future hearing dates in the case are motions to compel.  There are three motions to compel on calendar
on 4/01/25 and one on 4/03/25.  The Court
continues the hearing on the 4/01/25 motions to 4/03/25.  The Court sets a Case Management Conference
for 4/03/25 at 8:30 a.m., to be held contemporaneously with the motions to
compel.  The Court asks the parties to
make best efforts to resolve the discovery issues relating to the 4/03/25
hearing, such that the motions need not go forward.  
 
Plaintiff is ordered to give
notice.  
 
Parties who intend to submit
on this tentative must send an email to the court at gdcdepts27@lacourt.org indicating intention to submit on the tentative
as directed by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department
does not receive an email indicating the parties are submitting on the
tentative and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion may be placed
off calendar.  If a party submits on
the tentative, the party’s email must include the case number and must identify
the party submitting on the tentative.  If
the parties do not submit on the tentative, they should arrange to appear
remotely.
