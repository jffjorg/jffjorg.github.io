```

The summary of the tentative ruling is as follows:

The Court has denied the motion to compel arbitration filed by the Defendants. The Court found that the claims do not arise from the contract, and therefore, the arbitration clause does not apply. The Court also found that the non-signatory Defendants cannot enforce the arbitration clause. Finally, the Court exercised its discretion to deny arbitration altogether under Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.2, subdivision (c) due to the potential for conflicting rulings on common issues of law or fact.
