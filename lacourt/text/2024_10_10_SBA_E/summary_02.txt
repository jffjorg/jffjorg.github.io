And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the Motion to Quash Service of Summons and to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction filed by Park Hotels & Resorts, Inc. The plaintiff, Devylle Campbell, has failed to provide evidence that California has personal jurisdiction over the defendants. The plaintiff's allegations that the defendants own, operate, manage, and do business in California are not sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction. The judge finds that the plaintiff has not met its burden to prove the factual basis for the exercise of jurisdiction and that the evidence consists of "vague assertions of ultimate fact rather than specific evidentiary facts." Therefore, the court grants the motion and dismisses the case for lack of personal jurisdiction.
