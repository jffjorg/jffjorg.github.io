And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to compel responses to the Request for Production of Documents, Set Two, which was served on the defendants on July 19, 2024, and has yet to be responded to. The plaintiff has also requested sanctions in the amount of $1,460, which the judge reduces to $500 due to the complexity of the motion. The defendants have failed to respond to the request for production and have filed no opposition to the motion. The court orders the defendants to respond to the request for production within 30 days and imposes a monetary sanction of $500 on the defendants.
