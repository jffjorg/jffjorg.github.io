RULING
            The
Court grants the Motion to Compel Responses to Request for Production, Set Two.
BACKGROUND
 
On
March 18, 2024, Plaintiff Sonia
Gramajo-Olivarri filed the Complaint alleging causes of action for negligence,
negligence per se, negligent hiring, false arrest, false imprisonment, assault,
battery, and IIED against Defendants Alliante International, Northgate Gonzales
Market, Robles, and Moreno resulting from Plaintiff being detained while at
Defendants grocery mart.
            On July 19, 2024, Plaintiff served the
Request for Production of Documents, Set Two on Defendants Alliante
International via email.
            On August 22, 2024, Plaintiff sent a
meet and confer letter to Defendant’s counsel.
            Defendant is yet to respond to the
Production of Documents, Set Two 
            On September 19, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the instant motion.
            No opposition has been filed
            Trial is set for January 29, 2025.
Legal
Standard
            A party must respond to
interrogatories and requests for production of documents within 30 days after
service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subd. (a).) If a party to whom interrogatories or requests for production of
documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the requesting party
may move for an order compelling responses to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).) The party also
waives the right to make any objections, including one based on privilege or
work-product protection. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a); Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel
responses to interrogatories or production of documents other than the cut-off
on hearing discovery motions 15 days before trial. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2024.020, subd. (a), 2030.290; Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) No meet and confer
efforts are required before filing a motion to compel responses to the
discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290; Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) 
 
Discussion
            Defendant has failed to respond to the
Request for Production of Documents, Set Two, served on July 19, 2024. (Mergerdomian
Decl. ¶ 3.) Defendant has filed no opposition to this motion.
Therefore, the Court grants the
motion to compel.
Sanctions
 
Failing
to respond to an authorized method of discovery is a sanctionable misuse of the
discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030 subd. (a), 2023.010 subd. (d).)
If a motion to compel a party to respond to interrogatories is successful, the
court must impose a monetary sanction against that party unless the
sanction would be unjust. (Code Civ. Proc § 2030.290 subd. (c), 2023.030 subd. (a),
2023.010 subd. (d); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific
Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.) The monetary
sanction includes the moving party’s reasonable expenses, such as attorney’s
fees and costs. (Code Civ. Proc § 2023.030 subd. (a).)
            Here, Plaintiff requests sanctions
in the amount of $1,460. Defendant has filed no opposition arguing why
sanctions would be unjust. Plaintiffs merely assert that they have “incurred
significant costs in preparing this motion to compel due to Defendants’ failure
to respond to the RFPD.” (Mergerdomian Decl. ¶ 10.) However, given that
sanctions are mandatory and factoring in the complexity of the instant motion,
the Court grants the sanctions in the amount of 500$. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030
subd. (a), 2023.010 subd. (d).)
            Therefore, the court grants the
Motion to Compel and orders sanctions in the sum of 500$.
