 BACKGROUND
 On June 29, 2020, Plaintiffs Melton Davood and Bianca
Janizeh filed a complaint against Defendants Edwin Aldana and Carlos Avalos
alleging causes of action for motor vehicle and general negligence. Plaintiffs
allege that their vehicle was struck by Defendants’ vehicle on the 405 freeway
on April 7, 2019, and that Defendant made an unsafe lane change.
 On October 23, 2020 (the date shows as June 29, 2020 on the
docket), in case number 20STCV40805, Plaintiff Karen Shahgeldyan also filed a
complaint Defendants Aldana and Avalos, and also named as a defendant Davood,
alleging causes of action for motor vehicle and general negligence, arising out
of the same collision.
 On March 30, 2021 (the date shows as June 29, 2020 on the
docket), Aldana and Avalos filed a complaint against Davood, and Shahgeldyan,
among others, alleging a cause of action for negligence arising out of the same
collision.
 On April 7, 2021, this case was consolidated with
20STCV40805.
 On August 25, 2022, all three cases were consolidated.
 On November 20, 2023, Defendants Aldana and Avalos filed
motions for summary judgment as to Plaintiff Shageldyan’s complaint and as to
Plaintiffs Davood and Janizeh’s complaint. On May 22, 2024, Plaintiffs Davood
and Janizeh filed an opposition. On June 6, 2024, Defendants filed a reply.
EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
A. Objections in Separate Statement
Plaintiffs Davood and Janizeh’s objections made in the
separate statement are improper and the Court declines to rule on them.  (See Hodjat v. State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins.
Co. (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 1, 7-9 (finding that the trial court did not abuse
its discretion in refusing to rule on the plaintiff’s evidentiary objections
made in plaintiff’s separate statement, to overlook plaintiff’s deficiency, or
to permit plaintiff the opportunity to reformat his opposing papers).
B. Plaintiffs’ Objections to Defendants’ Evidence:
The following objections are SUSTAINED: 1, 2, 3
“A properly qualified expert may offer an opinion relating
to a subject that is beyond common experience, if that expert's opinion will
assist the trier of fact.”  (Bushling v.
Fremont Medical Center (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 493, 510.)  “However, even when the witness qualifies as
an expert, he or she does not possess a carte blanche to express any opinion
within the area of expertise. [Citation.] For example … when an expert's opinion
is purely conclusory because unaccompanied by a reasoned explanation connecting
the factual predicates to the ultimate conclusion, that opinion has no
evidentiary value because an ‘expert opinion is worth no more than the reasons
upon which it rests.’ ” (Jennings v. Palomar Pomerado Health Systems, Inc.
(2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 1108, 1117.) “Regarding causation, the plaintiff must
offer an expert opinion that contains a reasoned explanation illuminating why
the facts have convinced the expert, and therefore should convince the jury,
that it is more probable than not the negligent act was a cause-in-fact of the
plaintiff’s injury.”  (Sanchez v. Kern
Emergency Medical Transportation Corp. (2017) 8 Cal.App.5th 146, 155.)
Here, the expert’s opinions as to why the tire mark on
Davood’s vehicle did not match with the Tundra’s tires and why the damage on
Davood’s vehicle was not consistent with a collision with a Tundra have not
been explained. These are bare conclusions without any reasoning and have no
evidentiary value.
C.        Defendants’
Objections to Plaintiffs’ Evidence:
Defendants’ objections 1-5 are SUSTAINED.
Objection No. 1 is sustained as it is hearsay.
Objections 2-4 relate to Officer Quindara’s deposition
testimony as to which vehicles made initial contact, which lanes Aldana was in,
and how many vehicles were involved in the collision. However, Officer
Quindara’s testimony for anything other than lay witness testimony is
inadmissible. Officer Quindara has not established he is qualified as an expert
on accident reconstruction, fault or causation. (See Evid. Code, § 720, subd.
(a).)
Objection No. 6 is SUSTAINED for lack of personal knowledge.
Objection No. 7 is OVERRULED. The entire traffic collision
report is not inadmissible.  However,
some of the statements contained in the report are hearsay. (See Objection 1.)
LEGAL STANDARD
The purpose of a motion for summary judgment or summary
adjudication “is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’
pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in
fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” 
(Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.)  “Code of Civil Procedure section 437c,
subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the
evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’
and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.”  (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)
“On a motion for summary judgment, the initial burden is
always on the moving party to make a prima facia showing that there are no
triable issues of material fact.”  (Scalf
v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.)  A defendant moving for summary judgment or
summary adjudication “has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of
action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the cause
of action . . . cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to
the cause of action.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 437c(p)(2).)  “Once the defendant . . .
has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a
triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or
a defense thereto.”  (Id.)  “If the plaintiff cannot do so, summary
judgment should be granted.”  (Avivi v.
Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 463, 467.)
As a general rule, in reviewing the evidence presented on
summary judgment, the moving party’s evidence is strictly construed and the
opposing party’s evidence is liberally construed. (See, e.g., Binder v. Aetna
Life Insurance Company (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 832; Brantley v. Pisaro (1996) 42
Cal.App.4th 1591.) “When deciding whether to grant summary judgment, the court
must consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers (except evidence to
which the court has sustained an objection), as well as all reasonable
inferences that may be drawn from that evidence, in the light most favorable to
the party opposing summary judgment.” 
(Avivi, 159 Cal.App.4th at 467; Code Civ. Proc., §437c(c).)
DISCUSSION
Defendants Aldana and Avalos move for summary judgment as to
Plaintiff’s Shageldyan’s complaint and as to Plaintiffs Davood and Janizeh’s
complaint, which allege causes of action for motor vehicle and general
negligence. Defendants argue that Plaintiffs cannot establish the element of
causation for their causes of action.
Negligence and Motor Vehicle Negligence
The elements of a cause of action for negligence are duty,
breach, causation, and damages.¿¿(Castellon v. U.S. Bancorp¿(2013) 220
Cal.App.4th 994, 998.)   However, the
elements of breach of that duty and causation are ordinarily questions of fact
for the jury's determination. [Citation.] Nevertheless, causation may be a
question of law if on undisputed facts there can be no reasonable difference of
opinion on causal nexus.” (Phillips v. TLC Plumbing, Inc. (2009) 172 Cal. App.
4th 1133, 1139.)
As to causation, a court may grant summary judgment when
there is no triable issue of material fact regarding causation only when there
is no other reasonable conclusion. 
(Kurinij v. Hanna & Morton (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 853, 864.)  To demonstrate actual or legal causation in
negligence action, plaintiff is required to show that the defendant's
negligence was a substantial factor in bringing about the injury. (Sandoval v.
Bank of America (2002) 94 Cal. App. 4th 1378, 1385.) Framed another way, the
plaintiff must show that it was “more probable than not” that the defendant’s
conduct was cause in fact of the result. (Id., at p. 1384.)
This case arises out of a multi-vehicle collision that
occurred on April 7, 2019, on the northbound 405 freeway in Los Angeles.
(Undisputed Material Fact (“UMF”) No. 1.)
As to both motions for summary judgment, Defendants Aldana
and Avalos argue that they did not cause the initial collision with Plaintiff
Davood’s Ford Fusion, and therefore did not cause the multi-vehicle accident. 
Defendants Aldana and Avalos present the following evidence.
On the date of the incident, Plaintiff Davood was driving a
Ford Fusion with Plaintiff Janizeh in the front passenger seat. (UMF No. 2.)
Immediately prior to the accident, Davood did not notice any other vehicles
involved and did not have any warnings that the accident was going to happen.
(UMF No. 3.) The first thing that Davood noticed about the accident was when he
felt an impact to the rear passenger side of his vehicle because he was looking
ahead. (Davood Depo., 14:7-9; 14:15- 20; 15:1-3; Janizeh Depo., 56:17-22;
123:5-20.) Also, Davood did not look at the rear-view mirror to see what
vehicle impacted his vehicle. (UMF No. 5.) Indeed, Davood told a police officer
that he did not know which vehicle collided with the right side of his vehicle.
(Davood Depo., 29:1-4.) 
Similarly, Janizeh (who was the front passenger in the Ford
Fusion) does not know what vehicle impacted the Ford Fusion. (Janizeh Depo.,
57:5-58:4.)
After the initial collision in the carpool lane, the Ford
Fusion struck the center divider and then veered to the right. (UMF No. 8.)
Neither Davood nor Janizeh know about any other vehicles that the Ford Fusion
collided with because their airbags were activated. (Davood Depo., 16:16-22;
Janizeh Depo., 57:5-12.)
Plaintiff Shahgeldyan was driving a Mercedes S class on
northbound 405 freeway either in lane 1 or 2 (the closest two lanes to the
carpool lane). (UMF No. 10.) Prior to the accident involving Shahgeldyan’s
vehicle, he did not notice anything that would lead him to think an accident
was about to happen and he did not see any of the vehicles involved in the
accident. (UMF Nos. 11-12 Shahgeldyan Depo., 28:5-11.) Shahgeldyan does not
recall the color of the vehicle that ran into his vehicle. (UMF No. 13.)
Aldana was driving a Toyota Tundra northbound on the 405
freeway with Avalos in the front passenger seat. (UMF No. 14.) Aldana was
driving the Toyota Tundra in the second lane from the right shoulder when it
first collided with a vehicle. (Aldana Decl., ¶ 3; Avalos Decl., ¶ 3.) Avalos
owned the Toyota Tundra at the time of the accident. (UMF No. 16.)
The Court finds that Defendants have met their initial
burden on summary judgment to show there are no triable issues of material fact
as to whether they caused the multi-vehicle collision. None of the plaintiffs
can say whether Defendant Aldana first struck Plaintiff Aldana’s vehicle, as
none of them saw anything prior to the collision occurring. Accordingly, the burden
shifted to Plaintiffs to present triable issues of material fact as to whether
Defendant Aldana caused the collision.
In opposition, Plaintiffs Davood and Janizeh attempt to raise
triable issues of fact through the deposition testimony of Officer J. Quindara,
the investigating officer at the scene of the accident.  Specifically, Plaintiff rely on testimony
that the officer determined that Defendant Aldana and Plaintiff Davood’s
vehicles made initial contact. (Quindara Depo., 19:9-11; 28:4-24.) However, as
discussed above, this evidence is not admissible to establish causation as
Officer Quindara is not qualified as an expert on fault and causation.
Next, Plaintiffs rely on their own interrogatories to assert
that Aldana made an unsafe lane change and collided with them. (PMF No. 12;
Davood’s Response to Form Interrogatory 20.8.) However, a party cannot use his
own interrogatory responses as evidence in support of or in opposition to a
summary judgment motion. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.410 [“[a]t . . . any . .
. hearing in the action, . . . the propounding party or any party other than
the responding party may use any answer or part of an answer to an
interrogatory only against the responding party”], italics added; Bayramoglu v.
Nationstar Mortgage LLC (2020) 51 Cal.App.5th 726, 741; Great American Ins.
Cos. v. Gordon Trucking, Inc. (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 445, 450.)
Therefore, Plaintiffs Davood and Janizeh have not met their
burden on summary judgment to present triable issues of material fact as to
whether they can establish the element of causation. In addition, Plaintiff
Shahgeldyan has failed to oppose the motion and has therefore also failed to
meet his burden. Thus, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment.
CONCLUSION
Defendants’ motions for summary judgment are GRANTED.
Defendants are ordered to give notice of this ruling.
