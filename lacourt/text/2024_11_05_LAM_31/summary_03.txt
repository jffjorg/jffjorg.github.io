And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge rules on three motions: Oh's motion to compel further responses to requests for documents and actual production of documents, Oh's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories, and Cho's motion to quash service of summons and the First Amended Complaint. The judge grants Oh's motions to compel further responses and sanctions Plaintiff in the sum of $603.30. The judge also grants Cho's motion to quash service of summons and the First Amended Complaint, finding that the Republic of Korea does not permit service by mail and that Plaintiff has not provided proof or argument to show service of process was properly effectuated as to Cho.
