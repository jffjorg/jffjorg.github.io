And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the motion to continue trial filed by the defendants, Goldenvoice, LLC, Al Malaikah Auditorium Company, and AEG Presents, LLC, without prejudice. The defendants had requested a continuance due to reserved dates for summary judgment motions to be heard in April 2025, which would conflict with the current trial date of August 28, 2024. However, the court finds that merely reserving a hearing date and stating an intention to file is not good cause for a continuance of trial. The court also notes that a party has a right to have its timely filed motion for summary judgment heard before trial, but in this case, the defendants have not filed their motions. Therefore, the motion to continue trial is denied without prejudice.
