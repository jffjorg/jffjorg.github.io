The judge finds that the Plaintiff's failure to respond waives all objections and that the motion to compel is granted. The judge also denies the request for sanctions, citing the lack of opposition to the motion and the persuasive value of the reasoning in a previous case. The judge orders the Plaintiff to serve verified, code-compliant written responses to the Defendant's Requests for Production (Set One) within 21 days of notice.
