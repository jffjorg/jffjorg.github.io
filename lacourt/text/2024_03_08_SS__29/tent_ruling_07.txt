Background
On December 15,
2022, Plaintiffs Geovanni Montes, Juan J. Montes Garcia, and Kimberly Montes
(collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed their complaint against Domingo Miguel
(“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 15 asserting causes of action for motor vehicle
negligence and general negligence arising out of a motor vehicle accident
occurring on November 10, 2022. 
 
On January 18,
2023, Defendant filed his answer in pro per.
 
On April 2,
2023, Plaintiffs served Defendant with Requests for Admission (Set One).
(Babaians Decl., ¶ 2.) Defendant did not respond. (Id., ¶ 6.)
 
On January
5, 2024, Plaintiffs filed this Motion
to Deem
Admitted the Truth of the Matters Specified in Requests for Admission (Set One).  Plaintiffs also seek sanctions.  Plaintiffs served Defendant by mail at the
address provided on his Answer.
 
No
opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
that the truth of the matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted. (Id.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for such a motion, and no meet
and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2033.280; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition,
a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Id.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014) 223
Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the matters contained in the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the
discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery.”  Where a
party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may
impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd.
(a).)
“The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act
in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no
opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn,
or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion
was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).) 
Discussion
On April 2,
2023, Plaintiffs served Defendant with Requests for Admission (Set One).  (Babaians Decl., ¶ 2.) Defendant never
responded. (Id., ¶ 6.)
 
Plaintiffs need not show anything more.  Their motion for a deemed-admitted order is
granted.
 
The Court also grants in part Plaintiffs’ request
for sanctions.  The Court sets sanctions
in the amount of $360, calculated based upon the one hour of attorney work set
forth in the declaration, multiplied by a reasonable billing rate of $300 per
hour for work of this nature, plus a filing fee.  (See Babaians Decl., ¶ 8.) 
Conclusion
 
The Court GRANTS the motion for a deemed-admitted
order.
 
The Court ORDERS that Defendant is deemed to have
admitted the truth of the matters specified in Plaintiffs’ Requests for Admission (Set One).
 
The Court GRANTS in part Plaintiff’s request
for sanctions.
 
The Court ORDER Defendant to pay sanctions
under the Civil Discovery Act in the amount of $360 to Plaintiffs within 30
days of notice.
 
Moving party is
ORDERED to give notice.
