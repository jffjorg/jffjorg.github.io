Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Yard House USA, Inc., has filed a motion to continue the trial date, which is currently set for May 2, 2024. The defendant has filed for summary judgment, with a hearing date set for February 24, 2025. The plaintiff, Fernando Rivera-Rivera, contends that the defendant had ample time to file the motion for summary judgment earlier and that the plaintiff will be prejudiced by a continuance due to his age and health conditions. The court has considered the factors outlined in California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332, and has determined that good cause exists for the continuance. The motion to continue trial is granted, and the trial date is advanced to early April 2025. The final status conference and all deadlines are reset based on the new trial date.
