And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling grants the motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff Olivia Navarro, filed by Defendant Costco Wholesale Corporation. The Plaintiff failed to appear for two previously noticed depositions, without valid objection. The Court finds that the Defendant has shown good cause for the production of documents and electronically stored information, and that the Plaintiff has failed to make a reasonable attempt to resolve the issue. The Court orders the Plaintiff to appear for and testify at a deposition within 30 days, and to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $615.
