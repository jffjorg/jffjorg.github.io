Olivia Navarro.
 
Tentative
The motion to compel is granted.
The request for sanctions is granted in part.
Background
On January
29, 2021, Plaintiff Olivia Navarro (“Plaintiff”) filed her complaint against
Costco Wholesale Corporation (“Defendant”), Miguel, and Does 1 through 25 for
Negligence and Premises Liability causes of action arising from television
falling on Plaintiff on February 15, 2019.
 
On February
21, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel Downtown L.A. Law Group was disqualified from
representing Plaintiff in this matter. Joseph Farzam Law Firm was substituted
in as attorney on December 6, 2023.
 
On May 5, 2023, Defendant filed this
motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff and request for sanctions. Plaintiff’s
counsel filed a declaration in opposition on February 26, 2024. Defendant filed
a reply on March 1, 2024.
 
Legal Standard
Code of Civil
Procedure § 2025.450(a) provides: 
“If, after
service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer, director,
managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an
organization that is a party under Section 2025.230, without having served a
valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to
proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document, electronically
stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the
party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s
attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice.” 
 The motion shall “(1) set forth specific facts
showing good cause justifying the production for inspection of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice” and “(2) be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration
under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition
and produce the documents, electronically stored information, or things
described in the deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the
petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.450(b)(2).) 
“Any party
served with a deposition notice that does not comply with Article 2 (commencing
with Section 2025.210) waives any error or irregularity unless that party
promptly serves a written objection specifying that error or irregularity at
least three calendar days prior to the date for which the deposition is
scheduled, on the party seeking to take the deposition and any other attorney
or party on whom the deposition notice was served.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.410(a).)
“A meet and
confer declaration in support of a motion shall state facts showing a
reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue
presented by the motion.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2016.040.)
A court shall
impose monetary sanctions in favor of the moving party if the motion to compel
is granted, unless “the one subject to sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust. (Code. Civ. Proc., § 2025.450(g)(1).)
Discussion
On
August 18, 2021, Defendant noticed Plaintiff’s deposition for November 9, 2021;
Plaintiff failed to appear. (Romersa Decl., ¶¶ 4, 5; Exh. A.) On January 18,
2023, Defendant noticed Plaintiff’s deposition for February 28, 2023. (Id.,
¶ 6; Exh. B.) Plaintiff served objection to the deposition. (Exh. C.) Defendant
served an amended notice of deposition that included production of documents
for February 28, 2023. (Id., ¶ 8; Exh. D.) Plaintiff did not appear for
the deposition. (Exh. E.)
 
Defendant
does not need to show anything more. 
Defendant is entitled to take Plaintiff’s deposition, and so far
Plaintiff has failed to appear for a properly noticed deposition, without valid
objection.  The motion to compel the
deposition is granted.
 
The
request for sanctions is granted in part. 
Given the relatively straightforward nature of a motion to compel a
deposition, the Court sets sanctions in the amount of $615, calculated based on
three hours of attorney time multiplied by counsel’s reasonable billing rate of
$205 per hour.  (Romersa Decl., ¶ 10.)
 
Conclusion
 
The Court
GRANTS Defendant’s motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff. 
 
The
Court ORDERS Plaintiff to appear for and testify at deposition at a date, time,
and place to be arranged by counsel within 30 days of notice.
 
The
Court GRANTS in part Defendant’s request for sanctions.
 
The
Court ORDERS Plaintiff to pay monetary sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act to
Defendant in the amount of $615.
 
Moving party is
ORDERED to give notice.
