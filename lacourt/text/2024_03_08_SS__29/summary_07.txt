And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the motion for a deemed-admitted order, deeming the truth of the matters specified in the plaintiffs' Requests for Admission (Set One) to be admitted. The judge also grants in part the plaintiffs' request for sanctions, ordering the defendant to pay $360 in sanctions to the plaintiffs within 30 days of notice. The judge finds that the defendant failed to respond to the requests for admission, which waived all objections and necessitated the motion. The judge is required to impose a monetary sanction under the Civil Discovery Act in this situation.
