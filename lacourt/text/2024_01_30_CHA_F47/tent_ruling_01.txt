Case #22CHCV00779
 
MOTION TO BE
RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
Motion filed on 12/13/23.
 
MOVING ATTORNEY: 
Joseph Kellener
CLIENT: Plaintiff Sergio Escobar
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order relieving Joseph
Kellener as counsel for Plaintiff Sergio Escobar in this action.  
 
RULING: The motion is placed off calendar.  
 
On 12/13/23, attorney Joseph Kellener filed this motion
to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Sergio Escobar in this action.  The hearing was originally scheduled for
7/17/24.  On 1/2/24, the Court
rescheduled the hearing on this motion to 1/30/24.  (See 1/2/24 Minute Order, p.3).  Plaintiff’s counsel (Joseph Kellner) was
ordered to give notice.  Id.
 
No proof of service has been filed for the motion.  (See CRC 3.1300(c) “Proof of service
of the moving papers must be filed no later than five court days before the
time appointed for the hearing.”).  Even
if the motion, which gives notice of the original hearing date, had been
served, Plaintiff’s counsel has not filed evidence that he gave notice that the
hearing on the motion was advanced from 7/17/24 to 1/30/24.  No opposition or other response to the motion
has been filed to cure the defect in notice. 
Therefore, the matter is placed off calendar.

RULING: The motions are granted, in part, and

SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of dispute between a residential
tenant, Plaintiff Sergio Escobar (Plaintiff), and his landlord, Defendant
Richard Bogert (Defendant).  On 9/22/22,
Plaintiff filed this action against Defendant for breach of warranty of
habitability, breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment, nuisance, negligence,
breach of contract and violation of LAMC 49.99.2.
 
On 1/17/23, Defendant served Plaintiff with Form
Interrogatories, Set 1; Special Interrogatories, Set 1 and Requests for
Production of Documents, Set 1.  (Glantz
Decl., Ex.A).  Pursuant to Plaintiff’s
counsel’s requests, Plaintiff was granted several extensions to respond to the
discovery with the last extension expiring on 4/4/23.  (Glantz Decl., Ex.B).  When Plaintiff failed to serve responses by
4/4/23, Defendant inquired several times about the overdue responses noting
that objections to the discovery had been waived.  (Glantz Decl., Ex.C-G).  Still, no responses were received.  (Glantz Decl.).
 
On 10/3/23, Defendant filed and served the instant motions
seeking orders: (1) compelling Plaintiff  to provide responses to Defendant’s Form
Interrogatories, Set 1, and imposing sanctions against Plaintiff and his
counsel of record in the amount of $1,086.65; and (2) compelling
Plaintiff  to provide responses to
Defendant’s Requests for Production, Set 1, and imposing sanctions against
Plaintiff and his counsel of record in the amount of $1,086.65.  The motions were originally scheduled for
hearing on 1/24/24 and 1/25/24.  On
1/2/24, pursuant to oral stipulation, the hearings on the motions were advanced
and reset for 1/30/24.  (See
1/2/24 Minute Order, p.3). 
Plaintiff’s  counsel (responding
party on this motion) was ordered to give notice.  Id. 
Although no such notice has been filed, it is clear Plaintiff’s counsel
had notice of the new hearing date. 
Plaintiff has not opposed or otherwise responded to the motions.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Due to Plaintiff’s failure to provide responses to the Form
Interrogatories and Requests for Production, Defendant is entitled to orders
compelling responses without objections. 
CCP 2030.290(a)-(b); CCP 2031.300(a)-(b).  
 
CCP 2023.040 provides: 
“A request for a sanction shall, in
the notice of motion, identify every person, party, and attorney against whom
the sanction is sought, and specify the type of sanction sought. The notice of
motion shall be supported by a memorandum of points and authorities, and
accompanied by a declaration setting forth facts supporting the amount of any
monetary sanction sought.”
 
Here, the notice of motion regarding Form Interrogatories
and supporting memorandum of points and authorities request sanctions against
“plaintiff and his counsel of record” and/or “plaintiff and his counsel”
without naming a specific attorney.  (See
Form Interrogatories Motion, p.2:6-8, p.6:21). 
The notice of motion regarding Requests for Production requests
sanctions against “plaintiff and his counsel of record;” however, the
memorandum of points and authorities only requests sanctions against Plaintiff.  (See Requests for Production Motion,
p.2:7-9, p.6:3).  The firm representing
Plaintiff has at least two attorneys as listed on the complaint filed on behalf
of Plaintiff.  Additionally, the
memorandums of points and authorities in support of the motions state:
 
“Should plaintiff oppose this
motion, defendant requests the Court impose monetary sanctions upon plaintiff
and his counsel, jointly and severally, as there is no substantial
justification for plaintiff to have avoided responded to discovery for over
eight months.”
 
(See Form Interrogatories
Motion, p.6:9-11; Requests for Production Motion, p.6:9-11).  
 
Based on the foregoing, it appears that sanctions are
only sought, if the motions are opposed which these motions are not.  Minimally, the statement makes the request
unclear. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
The requests to compel responses to Form Interrogatories,
Set 1, and Requests for Production, Set 1, are granted.  Responses without objections are due within 30
days.  Sanctions are denied.
 
The Court notes that Defendant’s counsel has failed to
electronically bookmark the exhibits attached to the motion as required by CRC
3.1110(f)(4).  Failure to comply with this
requirement in the future may result in papers not being considered, matters
being continued so that papers may be resubmitted in the proper format and/or
the imposition of sanctions.
