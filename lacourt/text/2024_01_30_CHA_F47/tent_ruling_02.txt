SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiffs Erickson Lavilla and
Rose Ann Lavilla’s (the Lavillas) purchase of real property commonly known as
29227 North Rio Lobo Way, Santa Clarita, California 91354 (the Property) from
Defendant Forrest K. Balmain (Defendant). 

 
Defendant acquired title to the Property on or about
3/2/22 by way of Quitclaim Deed from Mark Balmain.  (RJN, Ex.A). 
On or about 2/12/07, Defendant obtained a loan from Aegis Wholesale
Corporation (Aegis) in the amount of $587,200, which was secured by the
Property (2008 DOT).  (See RJN,
Ex.B).  On 3/26/10, the beneficial
interest under the 2007 DOT was assigned to Aurora Loan Services, LLC (Aurora
Assignment).  (RJN, Ex.C).  On 7/21/10, the beneficial interest under the
2007 DOT was assigned to MERS (MERS Assignment).  (RJN, Ex.D). 

 
On or about 6/22/22, Defendant sold the property to the
Lavillas for $730,000.00 (Insured DOT). 
(RJN, Ex.E).  The 2007 DOT was not
discovered in the title search and, unbeknownst to the Lavillas, the
encumbrance was not released from the Property when they purchased it.
 
On 7/18/22, the beneficial interest in the 2007 DOT was
assigned to Deutsche Bank (Deutsche Bank Assignment).  (RJN, Ex.F). 
On 8/2/22, a Substitution of Trustee whereby Barrett Daffin Frappier
Treder & Weiss, LLP (BDF) was substituted as trustee under the 2007 DOT was
recorded.  (RJN, Ex.G).  Deutsche Bank remained the beneficiary under
the 2007 DOT and Mr. Cooper was the loan servicer on the 2007 DOT for Deutsche
Bank.  
 
On 10/31/22, a Notice of Default and Election to Sell
Under Deed of Trust (NOD) was recorded. 
(RJN, Ex.H).  On 3/8/23, BDF began
foreclosure proceedings in connection with the 2007 DOT.  (RJN, Ex.I – Notice of Trustees Sale (NOTS)).
 
On 3/3/23, as title insurer for the Lavillas, Chicago
Title Insurance Company (Chicago Title) paid off the sums due under the 2007
DOT in the amount of $675,078.84 to prevent foreclosure and release the lien of
the 2007 DOT from the Property  (Rousso
Decl., Ex.3; RJN, Ex.J). 
 
During all times relevant to this action, Defendant did
not disclose the 2007 DOT and the Lavillas were not aware of same when they
purchased the Property.  As such, on
2/8/23, the Lavillas filed this action against Defendant and others for: (1)
Violation of Civil Code 2943 and for Statutory Damages/Injunctive Relief, (2)
For Accounting, (3) Declaratory Relief, (4) Fraud and Deceit and (5) Breach of
Implied Covenant (Civil Code 1113(2)). 
Claims against Deutsche Bank, Nationstar, Mr. Cooper and BDF have been
settled by virtue of Chicago Title’s Settlement Payment of $675,078.84 to
release the 2007 DOT from the Property. 
(Rousso Decl., Ex.3).  As such,
those parties have been dismissed from this action. 
 
Chicago Title, as the Lavillas title insurer and payor of
the 2007 DOT, seeks to pursue the Lavillas’ claims against Defendant for
Declaratory Relief, Fraud and Deceit and Breach of Implied Covenant as the
real-party-in-interest pursuant to its subrogation rights in the title
insurance policy issued the Lavillas.  (See
Rousso Decl., Ex.2, Condition 8). 
 
Therefore, on 12/29/23, the instant motion was filed
(served on 1/2/24 by overnight mail) seeking an order substituting Chicago
Title in place and stead of the Lavillas as the real-party-in-interest in this
case.  Defendant has not opposed the
motion.
 
ANALYSIS
 
The Lavillas’ Request for Judicial Notice (RJN) is
granted.
 
“An insurer/subrogee paying for a loss has the right to
pursue its insured’s rights and remedies against the third party causing the
loss.”  Allstate Insurance Co.
(1996) 46 CA4th 1794, 1799, as modified 8/1/96, citing Continental Casualty
Company (1956) 46 C2d 423, 429; AMCO Insurance Company (2016) 244
CA4th 883, 895-896.
 
In addition to Chicago Title’s right under the insurance
policy to be substituted into this action as subrogee, the right is recognized
by statute.  See CCP 368.5; Hearn
Pacific Corporation (2016) 247 CA4th 117, 133-134.
 
The substitution does not change the nature of the action
or any of the remaining claims as Chicago Title would merely be stepping into
the shoes of the Lavillas as the transferee and subrogee of all rights and
remedies that the Lavillas have against Defendant.  Therefore, Defendant will suffer no prejudice
by granting the relief requested in this motion.    
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted.
 
The Court notes that exhibits attached to the motion are
not electronically bookmarked as required. 
CRC 3.1110(f)(4); (5/3/19 First Amended General Order Re Mandatory
Filing for Civil, Technical Requirements, p.4:7-21 (General Order)).  Additionally, although there are electronic
bookmarks for the Request for Judicial Notice filed in support of the motion,
they are improperly labeled as numbered exhibits when the exhibits attached to
the Request for Judicial Notice are designated by letters.  Additionally, the bookmarks do not link to
the corresponding exhibit (if the numbers were to be replaced with
letters).  For example, the link for
“Exhibit 1” takes you to “Exhibit B,” the link for “Exhibit 2” takes you to
“Exhibit C.”  Also, the motion itself is
not in a text searchable format as required. 
(General Order, p.4:5-6).  
 
Counsel is warned that failure to properly comply with
the foregoing rules, orders and/or requirements in the future may result in
matters being continued so that papers can be re-submitted in compliance,
papers not being considered and/or the imposition of sanctions.
