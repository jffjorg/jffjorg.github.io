And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a demurrer filed by defendants Ford Motor Company and Autonation Ford Valencia against plaintiffs Timothy McGinley and Chloe McGinley. The demurrer is aimed at the 5th and 6th causes of action, which are for fraudulent inducement and negligent repair, respectively.

The judge has sustained the demurrer as to the 5th cause of action, finding that the complaint does not adequately allege the elements of a fraudulent concealment claim. Specifically, the complaint does not specify the alleged defect in the vehicle, fail to plead sufficient facts to establish a duty by Ford to disclose the defect, and fail to plead sufficient facts to show that Ford was aware of the defect at the time of sale.

The judge has overruled the demurrer as to the 6th cause of action, finding that the complaint adequately alleges the elements of a negligent repair claim, including damages. The judge has given the plaintiffs 30 days to amend their complaint to cure the defects in their 5th cause of action.

The case is set for a hearing on January 30, 2024, and an amended complaint is due within 30 days.
