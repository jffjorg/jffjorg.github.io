And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the motion to substitute Chicago Title Insurance Company in place of the Lavillas as the real-party-in-interest in this case. The motion was filed by Chicago Title, as the title insurer and payor of the 2007 Deed of Trust (DOT), seeking to pursue the Lavillas' claims against Defendant for declaratory relief, fraud and deceit, and breach of implied covenant. The judge finds that Chicago Title has the right to pursue its insured's rights and remedies against the third party causing the loss, as recognized by statute and case law. The substitution does not change the nature of the action or any of the remaining claims, and Defendant will suffer no prejudice by granting the relief requested in this motion. The judge notes that the exhibits attached to the motion are not properly bookmarked and the motion itself is not in a text searchable format, and warns counsel that failure to comply with the rules, orders, and requirements in the future may result in matters being continued, papers not being considered, or the imposition of sanctions.
