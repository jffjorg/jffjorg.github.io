And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on two motions: one filed by the defendant seeking to be relieved as counsel, and the other seeking to compel responses to discovery requests and impose sanctions. The judge has placed the motion to be relieved as counsel off calendar due to the lack of proof of service and the failure of the plaintiff's counsel to give notice of the advanced hearing date.

The judge has granted the motions to compel responses to the discovery requests, but denied the request for sanctions. The judge notes that the defendant's counsel failed to electronically bookmark the exhibits attached to the motion as required by the court's rules, and warns that failure to comply with this requirement in the future may result in papers not being considered, matters being continued, or the imposition of sanctions.

The judge orders the plaintiff to provide responses to the discovery requests without objections within 30 days.
