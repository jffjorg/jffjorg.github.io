SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiffs Timothy McGinley and
Chloe McGinley’s (Plaintiffs) purchase of a 2021 Ford F-150 (the Vehicle) on 11/19/21.  (Complaint ¶9).  Plaintiffs allege that “[d]efects and
nonconformities to warranty manifested themselves within the applicable express
warranty period, including but not limited to, transmission defects, engine
defects; among other defects and non-conformities.” (Id. ¶14).  Plaintiffs allege that they “discovered
Defendants’ wrongful conduct alleged herein shortly before the filing of the
complaint, as the Vehicle continued to exhibit symptoms of defects following
FMC’s unsuccessful attempts to repair them. However, FMC failed to provide
restitution pursuant to the Song- Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.”  (Id. ¶8).
 
Plaintiffs allege that Defendant Ford Motor Company
(Ford) “acquired its knowledge of the Transmission Defect prior to Plaintiffs
acquiring the Subject Vehicle, through sources not available to consumers such
as Plaintiffs” and had a duty to disclose “the defective nature of the Subject
Vehicle and its transmission” because Ford was “in a superior position from
various internal sources to know (or should have known) the true state of facts
about the material defects contained in vehicles equipped with the defective
transmission[.]”  (Complaint ¶¶61, 64, 64(b)).  
 
As against Defendant Autonation Ford Valencia
(Autonation), Plaintiffs allege that they presented the Vehicle to Autonation
for substantial repair “on at least one occasion” and that Autonation breached
its duty by failing to properly store, prepare and repair the subject vehicle
in accordance with industry standards. 
(Complaint ¶¶73, 75).  
On 8/10/23, Plaintiffs filed this action against Ford and
Autonation for: (1) Violation of Civil Code 1793.2(d); (2) Violation of Civil
Code 1793.2(b); (3) Violation of Civil Code 1793.2(a)(3); (4) Breach of Implied
Warranty of Merchantability – Civil Code 1791.1, 1794, 1795.5; 
(5) Fraudulent Inducement – Concealment and (6) Negligent
Repair.  After meet and confer efforts
failed to resolve issues Ford and Autonation had with the complaint, on 9/13/23,
Ford and Autonation filed and served the instant demurrer to the 5th
cause of action for Fraudulent Inducement – Concealment which is alleged
against Ford and the 6th cause of action for Negligent Repair which
is alleged against Autonation.  Plaintiffs
have opposed the demurrer and Ford has filed a reply to the opposition.    
 
ANALYSIS
 
A demurrer may be based on the ground that the complaint
fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.  CCP 430.10(e).  A demurrer admits the truth of all properly
pleaded facts regardless of how unlikely or improbable they may be.  See Aubry (1992) 2 C4th 962,
966-967; Del E. Webb Corp. (1981) 123 CA3d 593, 604.  Allegations in a complaint must be liberally
construed with a view toward substantial justice between the parties.  CCP 452. 

 
5th Cause of Action – Fraudulent Inducement
– Concealment
 
The elements of a fraudulent concealment cause of action
are: (1) concealment or suppression of a material fact, (2) a duty to disclose
the fact to the plaintiff, (3) intentional concealment or suppression of the
fact with the intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4) that the plaintiff was
unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he/she did if he/she had known
of the concealed or suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of the concealment or
suppression of the fact, the plaintiffs sustained damage.  Boschma (2011) 198 CA4th 230, 248.  Additionally, every element of a fraud cause
of action must be alleged with factual specificity.  Cooper (1990) 219 CA3d 1252, 1262; Lazar
(1996) 12 C4th 631, 645.  Concealment of
a material fact is actionable when there is a duty of disclosure, which may
arise from a relationship between the parties, such as a buyer-seller
relationship.  Dhital (2022) 84
CA5th 828, 843-844, review granted, citing Hoffman (2014) 228 CA4th
1178, 1186-1187.  In such case, the
plaintiff must describe the content and where the omitted information should or
could have been revealed.  Tapia
(S.D. Cal. 2015) 116 F.Supp.3d 1149, 1163.
 
Plaintiffs have failed to allege with the requisite
particularity the defect Ford allegedly concealed.  The complaint merely describes a list of ways
in which Ford F-150s transmissions may be defective and hazardous driving
conditions relating generally to the purported transmission defect but does not
state what the alleged defect is in the Vehicle or otherwise .  (Complaint ¶25).  Such allegations are insufficient to support
the fraud-based claim.  Santana
(2020) 56 CA5th 334, 345.
 
Plaintiffs have also failed to allege where the omitted
information should or could have been revealed by Ford and fail to identify the
requisite representative samples of advertisements, offers, or other
representations by Ford that consumers relied upon to make their purchase.
Additionally, Plaintiffs do not identify by name who made the alleged omissions
when they purchased the Vehicle. 
Even if Plaintiffs had pled an identifiable defect in the
Vehicle, they have not alleged facts showing Ford had a legal duty to disclose
those facts.  “There are ‘four
circumstances in which nondisclosure or concealment may constitute actionable
fraud: (1) when the defendant is in a fiduciary relationship with the
plaintiff; (2) when the defendant had exclusive knowledge of material facts not
known to the plaintiff; (3) when the defendant actively conceals a material
fact from the plaintiff; and (4) when the defendant makes partial
representations but also suppresses some material facts.’”  LiMandri (1997) 52 CA4th 326, 336.  Regardless of the circumstances under which a
duty to disclose may arise, Plaintiffs must allege facts to show that Ford was
aware of a defect at the time of sale.  Wilson
(9th Cir. 2012) 668 F.3d 1136, 1145.
 
Here, Plaintiffs have failed to plead sufficient facts to
establish any of the above circumstances exist so as to give rise to a duty by
Ford to disclose to Plaintiffs.  (See
Complaint ¶64(a), (b)).  Plaintiffs have
also failed to plead sufficient facts to show Ford was aware of the purported
defect in the Vehicle at the time of the sale to Plaintiffs.  (See Complaint ¶62).      
 
Plaintiffs have also failed to allege sufficient facts to
establish that their fraud claim is not barred by the “economic loss
rule.”  “[T]he economic loss rule allows
a plaintiff to recover in strict products liability in tort when a product
defect causes damage to ‘other property,’ that is, property other than the
product itself.  The law of contractual
warranty governs damage to the product itself.” 
Robinson Helicopter Co., Inc. (2004) 34 C4th 979, 989 citing Jimenez
(2002) 29 C4th 473, 482-483.  Based on
the allegations in the Complaint, it appears that the only duty allegedly
breached was that created by the terms of the warranty and the only harm which
resulted from Ford’s alleged concealment was that Plaintiffs would not have
purchased/leased the Vehicle.  (See
Complaint ¶¶8, 66).     
 
Also, the holding in Robinson Helicopter was
narrowly limited to “a defendant’s affirmative misrepresentations on which a
plaintiff relies and which expose a plaintiff to liability for personal damages
independent of the Plaintiffs’ economic loss.” 
Robinson Helicopter, supra at 993; In re Ford Motor Co.
(C.D. Cal. 2020) 483 F.Supp.3d 838, 848. 
Here, the fraud claim is based on purported concealment, not affirmative
misrepresentations.
 
6th Cause of Action – Negligent Repair
 
Autonation contends that Plaintiffs’ complaint fails to
allege sufficient facts to state the claim for negligent repair based on the
“economic loss rule” and failure to sufficiently allege all of the elements of
the cause of action (i.e., damages).  
 
The “economic loss rule ” provides that there is no
recovery in tort where damages consist solely of economic loss.  See Sheen (2022) 12 C5th 905,
922; Pilgrim 2020 WL 7222098, at *10. 
The purpose of the “economic loss rule” is to prevent the law of
contract and the law of tort from dissolving into each other.  Robinson Helicopter, supra at 988.  However, not all tort claims for monetary
losses between contractual parties are barred by the economic loss rule.  Sheen, supra at 923.  Courts have allowed tort recovery in some
cases involving insurance policies and contracts for professional
services.  Id. at 929, 933.
 
“A contract to perform services gives rise to a duty of
care which requires that such services be performed in a competent and
reasonable manner.  A negligent failure
to do so may be both a breach of contract and a tort.”  North American Chemical Co. (1997) 59
CA4th 764, 774.  Additionally, the
economic loss rule does not bar recovery in tort for damage that a defective
product causes to other portions of a larger product into which the former has
been incorporated.  Jimenez (2002)
29 C4th 473, 483; See also Velasco (S.D. Cal. 2022) 2022 WL
2287258 at 4.
 
Autonation has failed to establish that Plaintiffs’
negligent repair claim is barred as a matter of law by the “economic loss
rule.”
 
Additionally, a complaint must only allege facts
sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might prove a
plaintiff’s claim need not be alleged.  See
C.A. (2012) 53 CA4th 861, 872. 
Here, Plaintiffs have alleged that Autonation’s alleged negligent repair
of the Vehicle was a proximate cause of Plaintiffs’ damages which is sufficient
to plead the damage element of the negligent repair claim.  (Complaint ¶¶72-76); See CACI 1220.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The demurrer is sustained as to the 5th cause
of action for Fraudulent Inducement – Concealment for the reasons set forth
above.  Due to the liberal policy of
allowing leave to amend and because this is only the original complaint,
Plaintiffs are given the opportunity to try to cure the defects in their 5th
cause of action.   
 
The demurrer is overruled as to the 6th cause
of action for Negligent Repair for the reasons set forth above.
 
An amended complaint is due within 30 days.
