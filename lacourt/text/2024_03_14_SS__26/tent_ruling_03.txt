ANALYSIS:
 
Judgment Creditor Andrew Krain (“Judgment Creditor”), in pro
per, filed the instant action for fraud against Alina Grygoryshyna (“Judgment
Debtor”), also in pro per, on July 6, 2020. Following Judgment Debtor’s failure
to appear, the Court entered default judgment in Judgment Creditor’s favor on
January 4, 2021. Judgment Creditor filed the instant Motion to Compel Third
Parties to Produce Documents on September 25, 2023. Third-party Bank of Hope
filed an opposition on November 13, 2023 and third-party Sammy Hakim (“Hakim”)
filed a “Response to Subpoena for Production”, which appears to partially
oppose the instant Motion, on December 11, 2023.  
 
The Motion initially came for hearing on December 14, 2023,
at which time the Court granted the Motion in part and continued it in part.
Specifically, the Court granted Judgment Creditor’s request for production of
Judgment Debtor and Hakim’s confidential marriage license and continued the
request for production of documents from third-party financial entities to
March 14, 2024. (Minute Order, 12/14/23, pp. 1-2.) The request for production
of documents by third-party financial entities was continued to allow for
clarity on the question of the marriage of Judgment Debtor and Hakim. (Id.
at p. 3.) On February 9, 2024, the Court granted Judgment Creditor’s Motion for
In Camera Examination with respect to the confidential marriage license of
Judgment Debtor and Hakim. (Minute Order, 02/09/24.) However, no date has been
set for the in camera review so there is no clarity on the issue of Judgment
Debtor and Hakim’s marriage at this time that would allow for a ruling on
Judgment Creditor’s request to compel the third-party financial entities. 
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, Judgment Creditor Andrew Krain’s Motion to Compel
Third Party Production of Documents is CONTINUED TO APRIL 8, 2024 AT 10:00 AM
