The tentative ruling grants Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority's (LACMTA) Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings without leave to amend. The Court finds that the Plaintiff's Complaint fails to allege compliance with the Government Tort Claims Act, which is an essential element of a claim against a public entity. The Court also finds that the Plaintiff's failure to file proof of service and failure to appear in court on August 30, 2022, warrant dismissal of the action. The Defendant is ordered to file a Judgment of Dismissal within 20 days of the order.
