ANALYSIS:
 
Richard Heng Taing dba USA Donuts (“Plaintiff”) filed the
instant action against Defendant Worldwide ATM, Inc. (“Defendant”) on April 24,
2023. On February 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant (1) Motion to Compel Attendance
at Deposition and Request for Sanctions; and (2) Motion to Deem Requests for
Admission, Set One, Admitted and Request for Sanctions. No oppositions have
been filed to date. 
 
Compel Attendance
at Deposition
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, section (a) states
in relevant part: 
 
If, after service of a deposition
notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or
employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that is a party
under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section
2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce
for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move
for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the
production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).) The motion must
also “set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the production for
inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice” and “be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,
subds. (b)(1), (2).) 
 
On June 22, 2023, Plaintiff served a Notice of Deposition
and Inspection of Writings on Defendant, setting the deposition for July 21,
2023. (Motion, Gentino Decl., Exh. 1.) Defendant did not appear. (Id. at
¶2.) On November 2, 2023, Plaintiff served a second Notice of Deposition and
Inspection of Writings on Defendant, setting the deposition for November 15,
2023. (Id. at Exh. 2.) Defendant did not appear for the second
deposition. (Id. at ¶3.) Plaintiff’s counsel called defense counsel
regarding Defendant’s failure to appear and left a voicemail. (Id. at
¶4.) No response was ever made. (Ibid.) Nor has Defendant filed an
opposition to this Motion. Due to Defendant’s failure to cooperate in the
taking of their deposition, Plaintiff is entitled to an order compelling their
appearance. An award of sanctions is also appropriate due to Defendant’s
non-cooperation. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).) Plaintiff request
for monetary sanctions, however, is excessive given this straightforward and
unopposed motion. Under a lodestar calculation, sanctions are granted in the
amount of $718.91 based on one hour of attorney time billed at $650.00 per hour
and $68.91 in costs. (Motion, Gentino Decl., ¶8.)
 
Deem Requests for
Admission Admitted
 
On November 3, 2023, Plaintiff served Requests for Admission
Set One, on Defendant. (Motion, Gentino Decl.,
Exh. A.) Defendant has not served responses. (Id. at ¶2.) Plaintiff
filed the instant Motion to Deem Requests for Admission, Set One, Admitted and
Request for Sanctions, on February 13, 2024. No opposition has been filed to
date.
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to compel initial responses can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290.) Further, the motion can be brought any time after the responding
party fails to provide the responses. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290.) Based on Defendant’s failure to respond
to the propounded discovery, Plaintiff is entitled to an order compelling it to
serve verified responses to the discovery requests without objections. 
 
Defendant’s failure to timely respond constitutes a misuse
of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) Sanctions
are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030
and have been properly noticed. However, the amount of sanctions sought is
excessive under a lodestar calculation. Sanctions are awarded against Defendant
in the amount of $393.91 based on half-an-hour of attorney time billed at
$650.00 per hour and costs of $68.91. (Motion, Gentino Decl., ¶8.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff
Richard Heng Taing dba USA Donuts’ (1) Motion to Compel Attendance at
Deposition and Request for Sanctions; and (2) Motion to Deem Requests for
Admission, Set One, Admitted and Request for Sanctions are GRANTED. DEFENDANT WORLDWIDE ATM, INC. IS ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $1,112.82 TO PLAINTIFF’S
COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
