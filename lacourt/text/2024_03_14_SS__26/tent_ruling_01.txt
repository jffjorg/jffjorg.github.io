ON THE PLEADINGS
(CCP §§ 430.31,
et seq., 435, et seq.)

Defendant Los Angeles County
Metropolitan Transit Authority’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is
GRANTED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND. DEFENDANT IS TO FILE A JUDGMENT OF DISMISSAL
WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Williams Briand
(“Plaintiff”), in pro per, filed this purported class action for civil rights
violations against Defendant Los Angeles Country Metropolitan Transportation
Authority (“Defendant”), on August 25, 2020. The action was originally filed in
the unlimited civil court and reclassified as a limited civil case on November
8, 2021. (Minute Order, 11/08/21.) An order to show cause regarding failure to
file proof of service was scheduled and then continued multiple times in the
limited court until August 30, 2022, with a warning to Plaintiff that failure
to appear might result in dismissal of the action. When Plaintiff failed to
appear on August 30, 2022, the Court dismissed the action without prejudice.
(Minute Order, 08/30/22.) 
 
On March 27, 2023, the Court
granted Plaintiff’s motion to vacate the dismissal. (Minute Order, 03/27/23.)
Defendant filed its answer to the Complaint on September 26, 2023. On November
13, 2023, the Court denied Plaintiff’s motion to reclassify the action to a
court of unlimited jurisdiction. 
 
Defendant filed the instant
Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings on February 6, 2024. On March 1, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a conditional request for dismissal but the request was denied
by the clerk’s office. (Request for Dismissal, 03/01/24.)  No opposition to the Motion for Judgment on
the Pleadings has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
As an initial matter, the instant Motion is
not accompanied by a proof of service demonstrating service of the Motion and
notice of hearing on Plaintiff. Failure to give notice of a motion is
not only a violation of the statutory requirements but of due process. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1005; Jones v. Otero (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 754, 757.)
 
Defendant moves for judgment on
the pleadings with respect to the Complaint on the basis of uncertainty and
failure to allege compliance with the Government Tort Claims Act. The Motion is
brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 438, pursuant to which the
parties are required to meet and confer. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 438, 439.) The
Motion is accompanied by a meet and confer declaration, as required. (Motion, Panicker
Decl., ¶¶3-6 and Exh. A.)
 
Uncertainty is not a basis for
judgment on the pleadings under Code of Civil Procedure section 438. The Motion
instead cites Code of Civil Procedure section 430.30, which is the demurrer
statute to argue that the rules of demurrers apply to motions for judgment on
the pleadings. However, the specific statutory grounds for judgment on the
pleadings are distinct from the grounds for demurrer. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§
430.30, 438.) The overlap between demurrers and motions for judgment on the
pleadings is that under the state of the pleadings, together with matters that
may be judicially noticed, it appears that a party is entitled to judgment as a
matter of law. (Bezirdjian v. O’Reilly (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 316,
321-322, citing Schabarum v. California Legislature (1998) 60
Cal.App.4th 1205, 1216.) Matters that are subject to mandatory judicial notice
may be treated as part of the complaint and may be considered without notice to
the parties. Matters which are subject to permissive judicial notice must be
specified in the notice of motion, the supporting points and authorities, or as
the court otherwise permits. (Id.) The motion may not be supported by
extrinsic evidence. (Barker v. Hull (1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 221, 236.) 
 
The Motion for
Judgment on the Pleadings on the grounds of uncertainty, therefore, is denied.
However, Plaintiff’s failure to allege that he complied with the Government
Tort Claims Act prior to filing this action amounts to a failure to state
sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 438,
subd. (c)(1)(B)(ii).) Defendant is a public entity created by state law. (Pub.
Ut. Code, §§ 130050, 130051, 130051.5.) An essential element of a claim against
a public entity is an allegation that a claim has been presented to it and has
been acted on or rejected. (Gov. Code, § 910, et seq.) The Complaint does not
contain an allegation that Plaintiff presented a claim to Defendant, which
Defendant acted upon or rejected. Therefore, Defendant is entitled to judgment
on the pleadings for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action. Also, leave to amend is denied as Plaintiff has not filed any
opposition to the instant Motion.
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Los
Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority’s Motion for Judgment on the
Pleadings is GRANTED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND. DEFENDANT IS TO FILE A JUDGMENT OF
DISMISSAL WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
 
 
 
Moving party to give notice.
