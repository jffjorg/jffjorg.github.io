 Case Number:  23SMCV03318    Hearing Date:   October 4, 2024    Dept:  N CONTINUEThe request for attorney fees is excessive. Plaintiff is a serial litigant whose attorneys simply plug in names and businesses to their complaints. (Compl. ¶¶ 24, 25.) There is no basis to conclude that the Court should deviate from the schedule set forth in Local Rule 3.214, which provides for an award of $330 ($150 plus 6% of the excess over $1,000). There is no supplemental declaration from the investigator, and no declaration regarding statutory penalties, as previously ordered.
