 Case Number:  24SMCV01880    Hearing Date:   October 4, 2024    Dept:  N The Court finds that Plaintiff has established the basis of its claim, that it is entitled to possession of the vehicle, Defendants have wrongfully detained the vehicle, the current location of the vehicle at either 8500 Sunset Boulevard, Apartment E704, West Hollywood, California 90069 or 6712 Lankershim Boulevard, North Hollywood, California 91606 (Perez Decl. ¶ 18), and a description of the vehicle and its value, and Plaintiff has provided a statement that the vehicle has not been taken for a tax, assessment, or fine, pursuant to a statute or seized under an execution against the property of the plaintiff (Perez Decl. ¶ 16). The Court finds that Plaintiff’s claim is likely valid, as Plaintiff will more likely than not obtain a judgment against Defendants, the requirements for issuing the writ are established, and no opposition has been filed. Further, given that Defendants have no proper interest in the vehicle, the Court waives the requirement of Plaintiff filing an undertaking. Accordingly, Plaintiff VW Credit Inc., a corporation dba VW Credit Leasing Ltd.’s Application for Writ of Possession is GRANTED.
