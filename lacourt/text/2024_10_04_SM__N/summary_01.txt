  - Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
  - The court must consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers (except evidence to which the court has sustained an objection) in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has continued the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication to a date to be determined. The motion is based on the plaintiff's claim that the defendants breached a written agreement and a guaranty. The defendants oppose the motion, arguing that the plaintiff does not have authenticated evidence to support its claims. The judge has sustained the defendants' objections to the plaintiff's evidence and has given the plaintiff the opportunity to cure the defects with its evidence. The plaintiff must file a supplemental declaration authenticating its evidence and may also file a supplemental brief of no more than five pages in length. The defendants may file a supplemental responsive brief of no more than five pages in length. No further briefing will be considered. The judge's ruling is based on the laws of California, including the California Evidence Code and the California Code of Civil Procedure. The judge has also considered relevant case law, including Unifund CCR, LLC v. Dear and Midland Funding LLC v. Romero.
