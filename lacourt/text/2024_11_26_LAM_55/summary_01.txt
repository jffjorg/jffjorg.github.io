```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the respondent's motion to quash the subpoena issued to the Burbank Fire Department. The respondent had argued that the subpoena was not timely, did not provide sufficient notice to the consumer, and was not relevant to the case. The judge found that the accelerated timeframe of the proceeding constituted good cause for waiving the notice requirement, and that the rights of witnesses and consumers were preserved. The judge also held that a subpoena to produce documents at trial is valid in a Food and Agriculture Code section 31622 proceeding, and that the redacted information in the incident report is relevant to show whether the victim, Ms. Drissi, was under the influence of drugs, alcohol, or both at the time of the incident. Finally, the judge concluded that HIPAA does not prevent the disclosure of the redacted information, as Ms. Drissi was provided notice of the subpoena.
