The tentative ruling is about a motion to be relieved as counsel by Leon C. Alexander, Esq. for Plaintiffs Mohammad Chaudry and Bushra Chaudry. The court has considered the moving papers and found that the motion is moot due to substitutions of attorney.

The court also denied the motion because there is no proof of service of the new hearing date.
