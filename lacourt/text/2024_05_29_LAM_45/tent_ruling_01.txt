Background
 
Plaintiffs Alla Kutz and Igor Kutz (“Plaintiffs”) filed
this action on April 12, 2022, against defendants Mikhail Siretskiy; Big Block
Realty, Inc.; Cangas Re LLC; and Cal West Escrow, alleging causes of action for
(1) Breach of Contract; (2) Breach of Fiduciary Duty; (3) Negligence; (4)
Fraud; (5) Constructive Fraud; and (6) Rescission. 
This
action involves the attempted sale of real property between former friends. The
Complaint alleges defendant Siretskiy (“Defendant”) approached
Plaintiffs with an investment opportunity. Plaintiffs owned property and were
using it as an income producing property. They claim that Defendant told
Plaintiffs that if they sold their property and purchased a portion of
Defendant’s property, located at 5325 Cangas Drive in
Agora Hills (“the Cangas Property”), Plaintiffs would be able to take
advantage of a Tax Deferred Exchange pursuant to Section 1031 of the Internal
Revenue Code ("1031 Exchange") and would also be able to get a more
favorable return on their investment with the Cangas Property. (Compl., ¶ 14.)
Plaintiffs claim that they decided
to sell their property as part of the 1031 Exchange. (Id., ¶ 16.) As a result, Plaintiffs had 45 days from
December 22, 2020 (or until February 5, 2021), to identify “like-kind
replacement properties,” and 180 days to consummate the purchase of such
“replacement property” pursuant to the IRS rules and regulations for a
successful 1031 exchange. (Id.)
The complaint further alleges that
Plaintiffs and Defendant signed the Residential
Purchase Agreement and Joint Escrow Instructions (“the agreement”) on January
14, 2021 for the purchase of the Cangas Property. (Id., ¶ 19.) Further, the complaint alleges that Defendant was
acting as a dual real estate agent where he would represent both Plaintiffs and
himself in the transaction. (Id., ¶ 17.)
Pursuant to the agreement, Plaintiffs claim they were to purchase Defendants’
undivided 36% interest in the Cangas Property. The complaint further
alleges that in reality, Defendant held no legal interest in the Cangas Property at the time he signed the
agreement because on January 16, 2020, Defendant had quitclaimed the Cangas Property to an entity known as Cangas RE
LLC. (Id., ¶ 23.) 
Plaintiffs allege that the escrow company wrongfully
released the Kutzs’ initial deposit of $349,000 to Defendant Cangas RE LLC despite
the fact that the Purchase Agreement and Addendum No. 1 clearly identified Defendant
Siretskiy as the seller and owner of the Cangas Property. (Id., ¶ 29.)
Plaintiffs claim that on May 26,
2021, two weeks after escrow was to close under the agreement, Defendant
secretly took out a Deed of Trust and Assignment of Rents in the amount of
$500,000 against the property, and that the lender on this Deed of Trust was
Aykem, LLC, which is a real estate holding company. This Deed of Trust
subordinates the interests of Plaintiffs. (Id., ¶
33.) 
The complaint further alleges that on or
about June 16, 2021, Defendants did not close the escrow and convey the property
to Plaintiffs on May 10, 2021, notwithstanding the parties' written and express
instructions that it close on that date. (Id., ¶
35.)
Plaintiffs allege they were ultimately
required to pay $44,318 in taxes plus interest of $686.96 to the IRS, together
with $22,921 to the California Franchise Tax Board, that they would not have
incurred had the escrow closed as agreed to by Defendants under the 1031
exchange. (Id., ¶ 44.)
Plaintiffs allege that after the
1031 deadline passed, Plaintiffs requested that Defendant return their initial
deposit in the amount of $349,000 and cancel the Note, but Defendant refused. (Id.,
¶ 55.)
On April 24, 2024, Aykem, LLC filed a
motion to intervene. Plaintiffs filed an opposition on May 9, 2024. Aykem filed
a reply on May 13, 2024.
On May 6, 2024, Plaintiffs
filed this motion for leave to file an Amended Complaint. Aykem, LLC filed an
opposition on May 13, 2024. Plaintiff replied on May 21, 2024.
 
Request for Judicial
Notice
Plaintiffs
request judicial notice of: (1) a copy of the declaration of Aykem’s counsel;
(2) Plaintffs’ opposition to Aykem’s ex parte application; and (3) a
copy of the complaint in Siretskiy, et al. v. Aykem LLC, et al.,
Case No. 23SMCV04464. 
Aykem requests judicial notice of: (1) Deed of Trust; (2) Trustee’s Deed
upon Sale; and (3) Minute Order from Siretskiy v. Aykem in 23SMCV04464,
dismissing some of the causes of action in that matter.
The requests are granted pursuant to Evidence Code section 452(d).
Legal Standard
 
The court may, in
furtherance of justice, and on such terms as may be proper, allow a party to
amend any pleading. (CCP §§ 473, 576.) Judicial policy favors resolution of all
disputed matters between the parties and, therefore, leave to amend is
generally liberally granted. (Howard v.
County of San Diego (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1422, 1428.) Ordinarily, the
court will not consider the validity of the proposed amended pleading in ruling
on a motion for leave since grounds for a demurrer or motion to strike are premature.
(Kittredge Sports Co. v. Superior Court
(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1048.)
 
The application
for leave to amend should be made as soon as the need to amend is discovered.
(See Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324(b)(3)-(4) [separate declaration
accompanying the motion must specify when the facts giving rise to the amended
allegations were discovered and why the request for amendment was not made
earlier].) The closer the trial date, the stronger the showing required for
leave to amend. (See Duchrow v. Forrest
(2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1359, 1377-78.) 
If the party seeking the amendment has been dilatory, and the delay has
prejudiced the opposing party, the court has the discretion to deny leave to
amend. (Hirsa v. Superior Court
(1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 486, 490.) Prejudice exists where the amendment would
unreasonably delay trial, resulting in added costs of preparation and increased
discovery burdens, or result in loss of critical evidence. (Miles v. City of
Los Angeles (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 728, 739; P&D Consultants, Inc. v.
City of Carlsbad (2010) 190 Cal.App.4th 1332, 1345; Solit v. Tokai Bank,
Ltd. New York Branch (1999) 68 Cal.App.4th 1435, 1448; Magpali v. Farmers Group, Inc. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471, 486-488.)
 
Discussion
Plaintiffs move for leave to file
an Amended Complaint to add Aykem LLC as a defendant, and to include him as a
conspirator and aider and abettor under the second cause of action for breach
of fiduciary duty, fourth cause of action for fraud, and fifth cause of action
for constructive fraud. Plaintiffs also seek to add a cause of action under the
Uniform Voidable Transactions Act, Civil Code section 3439, et seq. against
Aykem and Defendant. Lastly, Plaintiff seek to clarify that they seek specific
performance as an alternative remedy in connection with their first cause of
action for breach of contract. 
Plaintiffs contend that the
evidence that Aykem was involved in the scheme to defraud Plaintiffs is
compelling. Plaintiffs allege that Defendant agreed to sell Plaintiffs 36% of
the Cangas Property for $756,000, had Plaintiffs deposit $349,000 with the escrow
company, Cal West, and then had Cal West release that deposit to him, before
recording the TIA memorializing Plaintiffs’ ownership interest in the Cangas
Property. Then, Plaintiffs claim, before recording Plaintiffs’ ownership
interest or closing the Cangas Property escrow (neither of which ever
occurred), Defendant opened a new escrow with Cal West, to consummate the Aykem
Loan, which Cal West did facilitate and close, taking on obvious liability that
no innocent escrow agent would have ever assumed. Plaintiffs allege that
predictably, Defendant made no loan payments, Aykem foreclosed and purported to
wipe out Plaintiffs’ interest in the Cangas Property, acquired ostensible
title, and then attempted to sell the stolen Cangas Property for a profit. Plaintiffs
allege that now, after an apparent falling out, Defendant himself claims under
penalty of perjury in a verified pleading that the Foreclosure Sale pursuant to
which Aykem took title to the Cangas Property was “illegal,” “null,” and
“void.” (Hayes Decl., ¶ 44; Exh. 5, Siretskiy v. Aykem, 7:20-27;
9:9-15.)
In opposition, Aykem contends
Plaintiff’s motion should be denied because Plaintiffs are not allowed to amend
a complaint by adding Aykem as a party pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 473(a)(1). Aykem argues that Section 473 allows amendment of a pleading
to add or strike the name of a party or to correct a mistake in the name of a
party, and has been construed only to allow correction of a reasonably
obvious misnomer, not to allow a completely different name to be substituted. (Stephens
v. Berry (1967) 249 Cal. App. 2d 474, 475; Kerr-McGee Chemical Corp. v.
Superior Court, supra, 160 Cal. App. 3d at p. 599, fn. 3.)
It is true that “a person or entity may become a party defendant only in
two ways: by being named as a defendant, or by being properly named and served
as a fictitiously named defendant pursuant to section 474.” (Kerr-Mcgee
Chemical Corp. v. Superior Court (1984) 160 Cal.App.3d 594, 597.) However,
the cases Defendant cites concern substituting a defendant for a doe defendant
(CCP § 474) after the statute of limitations has expired. Here, the
complaint was only filed in April 2022, and it does not appear the statute of
limitations has expired on the causes of action Plaintiffs seek against Aykem –
the statute of limitations for these causes of action ranges from 3 to 4 years.
Thus, if leave to add Aykem was not granted, Plaintiffs could simply file a
complaint against Aykem. 
 
            Based
on the foregoing, in view of the well-established liberality with which amendments are to be allowed, the motion is
granted. The court orders Plaintiffs to file their Amended Complaint,
attached as Exhibit 1 to the declaration of Hayes within 10 days of the date of
this ruling.
 
            As
Aykem is made a party to this case by the granting of this motion, Aykem’s
motion for leave to intervene is denied as moot.
 
            It
is so ordered.
