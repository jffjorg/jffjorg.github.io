Case #23CHCV02417
 
MOTION TO
COMPEL ARBITRATION
 
Motion filed on 11/20/23.
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant Lief Organics, LLC
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Mankind Essential, Inc.
NOTICE: ok
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order compelling
Plaintiff Mankind Essentials, Inc. to arbitrate its complaint.  Additionally, Defendant Lief Organics requests
an order staying all further judicial proceedings in this action pending
completion of arbitration.  
 
RULING: The motion is granted.
 
SUMMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY  
 
This action arises out of an agreement entered into by
Plaintiff Mankind Essentials, Inc.  (Plaintiff)
and Defendant Lief Organics, LLC (Defendant) for the manufacture of fertility
and dietary products for Mankind.  Based
on three orders, Plaintiff paid Defendant deposits totaling $22,787.50.  Plaintiff alleges that Defendant failed to
perform under the agreement.  
 
On 8/11/23, Mankind Essentials, Inc. and Talal Altamimi,
as co-plaintiffs, filed this action against Defendant for: (1) Breach of
Contract, (2) Fraudulent Deceit, (3) Breach of the Covenant of Good Faith and
Fair Dealing, (4) Promissory Fraud and (5) Negligence.  After attempts to meet and confer regarding
the issues Defendant had with the complaint were unsuccessful, on 11/20/23,
Defendant filed and served a demurrer to the 
original complaint.  On that same
date and after Plaintiff failed to respond to Defendant’s request that
Plaintiff agree to arbitrate its claims, Defendant filed and served the instant
motion seeking an order compelling Plaintiff Mankind Essentials, Inc. to
arbitrate its complaint.  (Bamford Decl.
¶¶4-5, Ex.C).  Additionally, Defendant
requests an order staying all further judicial proceedings in this action
pending completion of arbitration.  
 
On 12/28/23, 9 court days before the 1/11/24 hearing date
on the demurrer to the original complaint, Plaintiff Mankind Essentials, Inc.
(Plaintiff), alone, filed and served a First Amended Complaint which rendered
the demurrer moot.  (See 1/11/24
Minute Order citing CCP 472(a); CCP 1005(b)). 
 
After meet and confer efforts failed to resolve the
issues Defendant had with the First Amended Complaint, pursuant to an extension
of time to respond to the First Amended Complaint, on 2/9/24, Defendant filed
and served a demurrer to the 2nd, 4th and 5th
causes of action in the First Amended Complaint.  On 3/7/24, the date a reply was due to be
filed and served, Defendant filed and served a Notice of Non-Opposition to the
demurrer.  See CCP 1005(b).  On that same date and without any
explanation, Plaintiff filed and served a late opposition to the demurrer.  On 3/8/24, Defendant filed and served a reply
to the opposition.  
 
On 3/14/24, the Court sustained Defendant’s demurrer to
the First Amended Complaint with 30 days leave to amend.  (See 3/14/24 Minute Order).  On 5/2/24, Plaintiff filed its operative
Second Amended Complaint for: (1) Breach of Written Contract, (2) Fraudulent
Deceit, (3) Breach of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, (4) Promissory Fraud and (5)
Negligence.
 
On 5/28/24, Defendant filed and served a motion to strike
the Second Amended Complaint which is scheduled for hearing on 7/10/24.
 
At the 5/29/24 Case Management Conference, Plaintiff’s
counsel did not appear.  Rather, former
plaintiff Talal Altamimi appeared and represented that he is no longer
represented by counsel.  (See 5/29/24
Minute Order).  The Court noted that no
substitution of attorney had been filed and Altamimi was no longer a named
plaintiff in the action.  Id.  The Court set an Order to Show Cause Re:
Counsel Gary Saunders Failure to Appear on 5/29/24 for 6/14/24.  Id.
 
The Court notes that the notice of the Order to Show
Cause was mailed to attorney Saunders address of record which is: 4000
MacArthur Blvd., Suite 600, Newport Beach, CA 92660.  However, without filing a notice of change of
address, as of 3/7/24, documents filed by attorney Saunders on behalf of
Plaintiff have a different address: 610 Newport Center Dr., Suite 250, Newport
Beach, CA 92660.  (See Opposition
to Demurrer filed 3/7/24; Second Amended Complaint filed 5/2/24). 
 
No opposition or other response to the motion has been
filed.  The Court notes that the instant
motion was served by mail on Plaintiff’s counsel on 11/20/23 at counsel’s
address of record, the same date that the demurrer to the original complaint
was served and to which Plaintiff’s counsel responded by filing a First Amended
Complaint.  Similarly, the demurrer to
the First Amended Complaint, which was opposed, was served on Plaintiff’s
counsel by mail at the address of record on 2/9/24.  As such, despite the fact that Plaintiff’s
counsel has recently been filing documents with a different address, the
instant motion was properly served and seemingly received by Plaintiff’s
counsel.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
A party to an arbitration agreement may move to compel
arbitration upon the other party’s refusal to arbitrate.  See CCP 1281.2.  Both federal and California law have a strong
public policy favoring arbitration with doubts regarding the scope of
arbitrable issues being resolved in favor or arbitration.  See Lewis (2012) 205 CA4th 436,
443; Armendariz (2000) 24 C4th 83, 97; Moses H. Cone Memorial
Hospital (1983) 460 U.S. 1, 24-25; Cronus Investments, Inc. (2005)
35 C4th 376, 386.  California courts must
enforce valid arbitration agreements unless one of three exceptions apply.  See CCP 1281.2(a)-(c); Laswell
(2010) 189 CA4th 1399, 1405-1406.
 
On 11/18/22, Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a
Manufacturing Agreement which includes the following arbitration provision: 
 
“In the event of any dispute
between the parties pertaining to this Agreement cannot be resolved directly
between the parties, the dispute shall be resolved by arbitration conducted
through the American Arbitration Association or its successor, by a single
arbitrator selected by the parties in accordance with the rule of said organization.”
 
 
(Bamford Decl. ¶2, Ex. A, ¶18.1).
 
Here, each of Plaintiff’s claims against Defendant arise
out of the foregoing agreement between the parties.  Therefore, they are subject to
arbitration.  
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted.  Plaintiff
is ordered to submit its claims to arbitration. 
Additionally, this action is stayed pending the completion of the
arbitration.  CCP 1281
