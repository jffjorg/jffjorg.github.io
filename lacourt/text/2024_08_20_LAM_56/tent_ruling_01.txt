BACKGROUND
             On July 21, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a complaint
for violations of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act against Defendant Hyundai
Motor America (“Defendant”).  Plaintiffs
alleged causes of action for: (1) violation of Civil Code §1793.2(d); (2)
violation of Civil Code §1793.2(b); (3) violation of Civil Code §1793.2(a)(3);
(4) violation of breach of express warranty (Civil Code §1791.2(a); 1794); and
(5) breach of the implied warranty of merchantability (Civil Code §§1791.1 and
1794).
 
            On January 16, 2024, Plaintiffs
filed the present Motion to Compel Further Responses to Plaintiffs’ Requests
for Production, Set One (the “Motion to Compel”).  No opposition was filed.
 
            On May 29, 2024, the Court granted
the Motion and ordered Defendant to serve further, complete, Code-compliant,
verified responses to the RFPs within 20 days. 

 
            On June 7, 2024, Defendant filed a
Motion for Reconsideration, requesting the Court to reconsider and set aside
the May 29, 2024 Order on the ground that it had no notice of the Motion to
Compel.  In the supporting declarations
to Defendant’s Motion for Reconsideration, declarants attested that Plaintiffs
failed to provide notice of the Motion to Compel, and that as a result,
Defendant was unable to file its opposition to or attend the hearing for the
Motion to Compel.  On June 14, 2024, Defendant
also filed an Ex Parte Application to Stay Enforcement of the Court’s May 29,
2024 Order (the “Ex Parte Application”). 
In the Ex Parte Application, Defendant asserted that since the Motion
for Reconsideration was not to be heard until July 19, 2024, well beyond the
June 18, 2024 date of compliance regarding the Motion to Compel, Defendant
cannot comply with the May 29, 2024 Order without being prejudiced by the lack
of notice and the inability to have the matter reconsidered before the
compliance deadline.  On June 20, 2024, the
Court denied the Ex Parte Application.  
 
            During the hearing of the Motion for
Reconsideration on July 30, 2024, the Court denied the motion because there was
no new evidence to support it.  In the
interest of justice, however,  the Court,
on its own motion, vacated the May 29, 2024 Order since officers of the Court
have stated under penalty of perjury that they did not receive the service
copies of the Motion to Compel.  Consequently, the Court scheduled a new
hearing for the Motion to Compel on August 20, 2024, and set the deadline for
any opposition on August 2, 2024, and the deadline for any reply on August 9,
2024.  No opposition or reply has been
submitted within the deadlines stated.
 
MEET AND CONFER
The meet and confer requirement has been met.
             
DISCUSSION
Legal Standard
A motion to compel further responses may be brought
based on responses to requests for admission that: (1) provide evasive or
incomplete answers; or (2) make unmeritorious or overly-generalized
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.290(a).)  
 
Motions to compel further responses must always be
accompanied by a meet-and confer-declaration (per Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040)
demonstrating a “reasonable and good faith attempt an informal resolution of
each issue presented by the motion.”  (Id., §§ 2030.300(b), 2031.310(b)(2),
2033.290(b).)  They must also be
accompanied by a separate statement containing the requests and the responses,
verbatim, as well as reasons why a further response is warranted.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(a).)  The separate statement must also be complete
in itself; no extrinsic materials may be incorporated by reference.  (Id.,
rule 3.1345(c).)
 
            Here, Plaintiffs
move to compel further responses to Requests for Production (“RFPs”) Nos.
16-21.  Plaintiffs contend that Defendant’s
responses to the RFPs consisted of boilerplate objections and non-responsive
statements, and that such evasive responses fail to comply with the Code of
Civil Procedure, necessitating further responses.
 
As
noted by the Court in its May 29, 2024 Order, Plaintiffs have provided
sufficient reason for further responses. 
Plaintiffs' RFPs calls for the disclosure of documents related to the
"Powertrain Defect" that is purportedly present in their vehicle.  The RFPs seek documents that pertain to the
defect as it existed in vehicles of the same year, make, and model.  As explained by Plaintiffs, whether the defect
was present in other vehicles of the same specifications, and whether there
were bulletins, customer complaints, and internal communications related to
this defect, is pertinent to establish the Defendant's knowledge of the defect.
It also speaks to Defendant's capacity to rectify the defect, whether the
Defendant conducted reasonable investigations into the possibility of curing
the defect, and if so, how.  Defendant's
awareness of these matters is relevant to the civil penalties that can be
imposed under the Song Beverly Act, as well as whether Defendant took
appropriate measures to resolve the defect.
 
Having
established good cause for further production, the burden therefore shifts to
Defendant to justify its objections as meritorious.  As of August 2, 2024, the deadline for
Defendant to respond to the Motion to Compel, Defendant has not filed any
opposition, and has therefore not provided any justification for their
objections to the Plaintiffs’ RFPs.
 
RULING
Accordingly,
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel is GRANTED.  Defendant is ordered to serve further,
complete, Code-compliant, verified responses to the RFPs within 20 days of the
date of this Order.  Although the Motion
to Compel requests that the objections in the original responses be stricken,
the Court has no authority to do so, and therefore the objections stand, although
Defendant is ordered to provide substantive responses to the RFPs, together
with all responsive documents.  Plaintiffs did not request sanctions and, as
such, no sanctions are ordered.
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
 
Dated this 20th day of August 2024
