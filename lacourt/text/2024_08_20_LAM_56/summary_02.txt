And here is the summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motion for leave to serve Tomer Levi by publication and has granted the motion. The plaintiff, Alisa C. Schlesinger, individually and as Trustee of the Alisa C. Schlesinger Trust, seeks to serve Tomer Levi, who is allegedly an alter ego of TNL Renovation Inc., by publication due to diligent efforts to serve him at three different addresses. The plaintiff has attached a declaration of diligence to her motion, which outlines her efforts to serve Tomer Levi. The Court finds that the plaintiff has made a thorough search to locate Tomer Levi and has exhausted all reasonable means of serving him. Therefore, the Court grants the motion and allows the plaintiff to serve Tomer Levi by publication.
