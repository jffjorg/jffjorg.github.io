“[T]he CDA immunizes an interactive computer service provider that ‘passively
displays content that is created entirely by third parties,’ but not an
interactive computer service provider that acts as an information content
provider by creating or developing the content at issue.” (Sikhs for Justice “SFJ”, Inc. v. Facebook, Inc. (2015) 144 F.Spp.3d
1088, 1094.) 


[3]The
Court notes that although both the California Constitution and the U.S.
Constitution provide the freedom of speech, that right is as against
governmental abridgment of speech. Neither constitution prohibits the private abridgment of speech. (Manhattan Community Access Corporation v.
Halleck (2019) 587 U.S. 802, 808. Also see Cal. Const., Art. I, § 2, subd.
(a).) Defendant asserts that they have a constitutionally protected right to
decide which speech to allow on their Platform, and which to disallow. Defendant
asserts that no liability can come for its decisions in that regard.
