And here is the summary in English text:

The judge, Upinder S. Kalra, has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Reddit, Inc. against the Second Amended Complaint filed by Edwin Novel Jewelry Design, Inc. The demurrer argues that the Second Amended Complaint is barred by the Federal Communications Decency Act (47 U.S.C. § 230) and the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.

The judge finds that the Second Amended Complaint does not sufficiently allege defamatory statements made by Reddit's moderators and that Reddit is protected by Section 230 of the CDA. The judge also finds that the Second Amended Complaint does not sufficiently allege a claim for vicarious liability against Reddit.

The judge sustains the demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint and denies leave to amend. The judge grants judicial notice of the Reddit User Agreement and declines to further develop the argument on the First Amendment issue.

The case will proceed with the demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint sustained in its entirety without leave to amend.
