And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is based on the information presented in the case. The court notes that the defendant has a constitutionally protected right to decide which speech to allow on their platform, but this right is against governmental abridgment, not private abridgment. The court cites the Communications Decency Act (CDA) which immunizes interactive computer service providers that "passively display content created entirely by third parties." The court also notes that the California Constitution and the U.S. Constitution provide the freedom of speech, but this right is against governmental abridgment, not private abridgment. The court concludes that the defendant's decisions on which speech to allow on their platform are constitutionally protected.
