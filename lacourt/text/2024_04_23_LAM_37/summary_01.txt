And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court has tentatively ruled that the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint is sustained with leave to amend. The Plaintiff is granted 30 days leave to amend and the OSC RE: Amended Complaint is set for May 31, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. The court has determined that the Plaintiff's alter-ego allegations are insufficient to impose contractual liability on individual Defendants. The court has also determined that the Plaintiff's breach of contract claim fails because there is no evidence of a written contract. The demurrer to the second, third, and fourth causes of action is also sustained with leave to amend. The Plaintiff will be given the opportunity to amend its complaint to address the deficiencies identified by the court.
