And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has ruled in favor of the plaintiff, Anne McLellan, and granted her motion to compel answers to deposition questions from deponent Samuel DeFillippo. The Judge found that the questions asked during the deposition were not expert opinion questions, but rather fact questions seeking information about the presentation and its slides. The Judge also denied the defendant's request for monetary sanctions against the plaintiff, finding that the defendant's objection was made in good faith and was not an abuse of the discovery process. The Judge denied the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions against the defendant as well, finding that the defendant was not the prevailing party. The Judge's ruling requires DeFillippo to appear for deposition and answer the subject questions.
