And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling regarding the motions filed by the moving party, Kwon Joon Choi and Myung Won Choi, Trustees of the Choi Family Trust Dated March 30, 2009 (as the Community Property of Kwon Joon Choi and Myung Won Choi). The moving party filed three motions: a Motion for Appointment of Receiver, a Motion for Sale (MSA), and a Motion to Bifurcate. However, the moving party has since dismissed its FAC and Cross-Complaint, and all three cross-complainants (Jong Won Park, Tower Escrow, Inc., and Zoheir Abdullah) have also dismissed their cross-complaints. As a result, the motions are now off calendar.
