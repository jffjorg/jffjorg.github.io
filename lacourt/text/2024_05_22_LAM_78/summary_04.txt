And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant Christopher Mandalian's motion for attorney fees and costs in the reduced amount of $16,950 in fees and $948.94 in costs. The defendant had sought these fees and costs after successfully moving to strike the plaintiff's claim for malicious prosecution. The judge found that the defendant was the prevailing party on the anti-SLAPP motion and was entitled to an award of reasonable attorney fees and costs under California Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16(c). The judge reduced the fees and costs because some of the work done by the defendant's attorney was overlapping and related to the unsuccessful claim for defamation.
