 Case Number:  23STCV27983    Hearing Date:   May 22, 2024    Dept:  78 Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles Department 78  NAREK VARDANYAN,Plaintiff,vs. CHRISTOPHER MANDALIAN, Defendant.  Case No.:  23STCV27983 Hearing Date:  May 22, 2024    [TENTATIVE] RULING RE: DEFENDANTS CHRISTOPHER MANDALIAN’S SPECIAL MOTION TO STRIKE  Defendant Christopher Mandalian’s motion for attorney fees and costs is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $16,950 in fees and $948.94 in costs.Moving party to give notice.FACTUAL BACKGROUNDThis is an action for defamation and malicious prosecution. Plaintiff alleges that on October 2, 2023, Defendant reported to law enforcement that Plaintiff engaged in harassing and criminal behavior. Defendant reported that Plaintiff confronted him, stopping and clenching both fists as if preparing to fight. Plaintiff alleges that this statement was false, and that Defendant knew the statement was false at the time he made it.PROCEDURAL HISTORY On November 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed his Complaint against Defendant.On December 12, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint.On March 6, 2024, the Court granted Defendant’s Anti-SLAPP motion to strike in part.On April 23, 2024, Defendant filed this motion for attorney fees.On May 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition.On May 15, 2024, Defendant filed a reply.DISCUSSIONDefendant Christopher Mandalian moves for attorney fees and costs arising from his special motion to strike which was granted on March 6, 2024.Code Civ. Proc., section 425.16(c)(1) provides, in pertinent part, that “a prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike shall be entitled to recover his or her attorney’s fees and costs.”    “[O]nly those attorney fees and costs related to the special motion to strike, not the entire action, may be recovered under section 425.16, subdivision (c).”  (Jackson v. Yarbray (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 75, 92.)  The limitation of C.C.P. §425.16(c) to an award of costs and attorney fees incurred “in connection with the special motion to strike” has been interpreted to include, “expenses incurred in litigating an award of attorney fees after the trial court has granted the motion to strike. It also includes fees incurred in responding to an appeal of an order granting a special motion to strike or an order awarding attorney fees in connection with such motion.” (Wanland v. Law Offices of Mastagni, Holstedt & Chiurazzi (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 15, 21.)  “Where costs and attorney fees are authorized for responding to an appeal of an order awarding costs and attorney fees under [Code Civ. Proc., section 425.16(c)], there is no reason why this should not also encompass costs and attorney fees incurred in challenging the undertaking submitted by the plaintiff to stay enforcement of the award pending appeal.” (Ibid.)  Code Civ. Proc., section 425.16(c), “is broadly construed so as to effectuate the legislative purpose of reimbursing the prevailing defendant for expenses incurred in extricating herself from a baseless lawsuit. (Robertson v. Rodriguez (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 347, 362.)  “The California Supreme Court has upheld the lodestar method for determining the appropriate amount of attorney fees for a prevailing defendant on an anti-SLAPP motion. Under this method, a court assesses attorney fees by first determining the time spent and the reasonable hourly compensation of each attorney. The court next determines whether that lodestar figure should be adjusted based on various relevant factors, including a plaintiff’s limited success in the litigation.  In determining the lodestar amount, a prevailing party generally may not recover for work on causes of action on which the party was unsuccessful.”  (Mann v. Quality Old Time Service, Inc. (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 328, 342 (Citations Omitted).) “The anti-SLAPP statute reflects the Legislature’s strong preference for awarding attorney fees to successful defendants.” (Area 51, supra, 20 Cal.App.5th at p. 605 [internal quotations omitted].) But “there is no reason to encourage a defendant to bring an anti-SLAPP motion where the factual and legal grounds for the claims against the defendant remain the same after the resolution of the anti-SLAPP motion.” (Mann, supra, 139 Cal.App.4th at p. 340.)  The statute does not require the court to award a fee award when the motion, though partially successful, is of no practical effect. (Area 51 Productions, Inc v. City of Alameda (2018) 20 Cal.App.5th 581, 605; see also City of Colton v. Singletary (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 751, 783 [finding defendant prevailing party where “eliminating [plaintiff’s] request for an order of specific performance and a cease and desist order.”]; Moran v. Endres (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 952, 954-55 [finding the recover to be “only the most illusory victory” where the factual allegations defendants faced remained unchanged]; Mann v. Quality Old Time Service, Inc. (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 328, 340 (Mann) [finding elimination of trade liable cause of action had the potential to narrow the litigation with respect to damages and the focus of the claimed false statements].)Here, Plaintiff argues that Defendant’s request for fees must be denied entirely because Defendant devoted only four lines in the Anti-SLAPP motion to malicious prosecution, the cause of action which the Court struck after partially granting the motion. Additionally, Defendant only prevailed on one cause of action, meaning Plaintiff’s potential recovery, the factual allegations, and the work in trying the case has not changed. The Court agrees that Defendant is the prevailing party on the Anit-SLAPP motion. Although the motion was only granted as to one cause of action, Defendant obtained a practical benefit because the legal theories and damages related to the malicious prosecution cause of action are no longer available to Plaintiff, narrowing the litigation. Defendant is entitled to an award of reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs under Code Civ. Proc., section 425.16(c). The parties dispute the amount to be awarded. Plaintiff also argues the malicious prosecution issue was not novel and required minimal work. Plaintiff also argues Defendant’s costs are unnecessary and duplicative of the costs associated with the defamation cause of action. Defendant provided a detailed accounting of the time he spent on this matter and the Anti-SLAPP motion. Defendant only seeks fees for half of the time he spent on drafting the Anti-SLAPP motion and acknowledges that Defendant is not entitled to fees on the unsuccessful part of the motion. However, Defendant argues that a 50% reduction of these fees is warranted because Defendant received practical benefits from prevailing on the cause of action for malicious prosecution.  Mann is most instructive here. There, the court reduced the total fees sought by the defendant to fairly compensate defendants for the results achieved in pursuing the anti-SLAPP motion and avoids reimbursing them for objectives that were not attained. (Mann at p.346.) The court reasoned that although defendant only partially prevailed on the motion, the defendant gained more than mere dismissal of some causes of action. (Id.) In eliminating an actionable theory arising from alleged false statements, defendant restricted the factual allegations, reduced viable theories of recovery, limited discovery, lessened the work involved, and permitted both sides to evaluate liability, damages, and future legal expenses more realistically. (Id.) Although a defendant should not be entitled to obtain her entire attorney fees incurred on successful and unsuccessful clams merely because the attorney work on those claims was overlapping, the courts should first determine the lodestar amount for the hours expended on the successful claims, and, if the work on the successful and unsuccessful causes of action was overlapping, consider the defendant’s relative success on the motion in achieving his or her objective to reduce the amount if appropriate. (Mann at p.345.)Here, Defendant’s billing, excluding entries related to the defamation cause of action, is as follows:1 12/18/23 Examine First Amended Complaint .62 12/18/23 Research Case law regarding CCP 425.16 general standards and analysis 1.43 12/18/23 Research Case law regarding CCP 425.16 to causes of action for Malicious Prosecution and Civil Harassment Restraining Orders. 2.78 1/17/24 Review Restraining Order Filings .89 1/17/24 Review email to Hanson .210-17 1/22-26/24 Anti-SLAPP motion (condensed for simplicity) 11.218 1/28/24 Prepare ex parte to advance hearing within 30 days or a ruling that court makes a finding that docket conditions of the court require a later hearing. 320 1/31/24 Update ex parte to advance hearing within 30 days or a ruling that court makes a finding that docket conditions of the court require a later hearing. .421 2/2/24 Appearance by Alex Valenzuela for ex parte to advance hearing within 30 days or a ruling that court makes a finding that docket conditions of the court require a later hearing. .422 2/6/24 Prepare Notice of Ruling on Ex Parte .323-27 2/6/24 Reply to Anti-SLAPP (condensed for simplicity) 11.628 3/5/24 Review tentative ruling and prepare for Motion hearing .529 3/6/24 Personal Appearance at hearing 3.630 3/20/24 Prepare Notice of Ruling on Anti-SLAPP motion .331 4/22/24 Prepare Motion for Attorneys fees with Declaration and Exhibits. 4.632 Estimated Review opposition for attorney’s fees motion 233 Estimated Prepare Reply to Attorneys Fees Motion 434 Estimated Review court’s Tentative and Prepare for Hearing 135 Estimated Appearance for Attorneys Fees Motion 1Total 41.6Here, the Court finds that the entries related to general tasks in furtherance of the Anti-SLAPP motion are overlapping. For example, researching Code Civ. Proc., section 425.61, appearing at hearings, filing ex parte motions related to the hearing, and reviewing meet and confer correspondence would all support the entire Anti-SLAPP motion, including the cause of action for defamation. Entry numbers 3 and 8, however, are specific to the successful malicious prosecution cause of action because these tasks were specific to the restraining orders which are the subject of the cause of action for malicious prosecution. (See ruling dated March 6, 2024.) To account for Defendant’s relative success in disposing of one cause of action and to avoid compensating Plaintiff for any attorney work attributable to the unsuccessful claim for defamation, the Court will reduce the fees as follows:Type of Entry Entry Number Hours AwardedOverlapping Entries 1, 2, 9, 10-18, 20-30 16.75 (50% reduction)Non-overlapping entries 3, 8, 32-35 11.5 (no reduction)Total 28.25 hours$16,950Defendant’s counsel testifies that his billing rate is $600. (Valenzuela Decl., ¶3.) The Court finds this rate is reasonable given that counsel has 20 years of experience practicing in law and is experience as a civil litigation attorney. (Id., ¶2.)The same analysis will apply to the demand for costs. Because the costs for filing fees, printing, court reporter fees, and hearing transcripts would have been used to support both causes of action, successfully stricken or unsuccessfully stricken, the Court will also reduce costs by 50%. The court awards Defendant $948.94 in costs.DATED: May 22, 2024 ________________________Hon. Jill Feeney Judge of the Superior Court
