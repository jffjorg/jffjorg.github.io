The Court has set a hearing date for May 22, 2024, and orders the parties to appear remotely or in person to set a further briefing schedule. The Court is seeking further briefing on several topics, including: who was the insured under the insurance policy at the time of the three assaults; if the insured was Sanyiweile, Inc. or another corporation, what was Shen's position/role; how does Section 533 of the insurance code apply when the insured is a corporation; does Section 533 prohibit insurers from contracting to provide a defense to accusations of wrongful conduct; and what is the impact of Section 533 on Shen's two causes of action, which were not addressed by the Plaintiff.
