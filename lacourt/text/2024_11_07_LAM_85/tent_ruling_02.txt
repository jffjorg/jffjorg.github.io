Carl
Rinsch and Home VFX v. Ice Cream Fridge, LLC and Netflix Entertainment, LLC,
24STCP02772


Tentative decision on applications
for right to attach orders: granted  




 
 



Respondents Ice Cream Fridge, LLC (“Ice Cream”) and Netflix
Entertainment, LLC (“Netflix”) (collectively, (“Netflix Parties”) apply for
right to attach orders against Petitioners Carl Rinsch (“Rinsch”) and Home VFX
(collectively, “Debtors”).
The court has read and considered the moving papers (no
opposition was filed) and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
A. Statement of
the Case
On August 2, 2024, an Arbitration Award was issued requiring
Petitioners to pay Respondents $11,819,857.80. 
On October 31, 2024, the court denied Debtors motion to
vacate the arbitration award and granted the Netflix Parties’ petition to
confirm the arbitration award. 
 
B. Applicable Law
1. Attachment
Attachment is a
prejudgment remedy providing for the seizure of one or more of the defendant’s
assets to aid in the collection of a money demand pending the outcome of the
trial of the action.  See Whitehouse
v. Six Corporation, (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 527, 533.  In 1972, and in a 1977 comprehensive
revision, the Legislature enacted attachment legislation (CCP §481.010 et seq.)
that meets the due process requirements set forth in Randone v. Appellate
Department, (1971) 5 Cal.3d 536.  See
Western Steel & Ship Repair v. RMI, (12986) 176 Cal.App.3d 1108,
1115.  As the attachment statutes are
purely the creation of the Legislature, they are strictly construed.  Vershbow v. Reiner, (1991) 231
Cal.App.3d 879, 882.
A writ of attachment
may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for money, each of which
is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the total amount of the
claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount not less than five hundred
dollars ($500).  CCP §483.010(a).  A claim is “readily ascertainable” where the
amount due may be clearly ascertained from the contract and calculated by
evidence; the fact that damages are unliquidated is not determinative.  CIT Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v.
Super DVD, Inc., (“CIT”) (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 537, 540-41
(attachment appropriate for claim based on rent calculation for lease of
commercial equipment).
All property within
California of a corporation, association, or partnership is subject to
attachment if there is a method of levy for the property.  CCP §487.010(a), (b).  While a trustee is a natural person, a trust
is not.  Therefore, a trust’s property is
subject to attachment on the same basis as a corporation or partnership.  Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn &
Rossi v. Wilson, supra, 197 Cal.App.3d at 4.
The plaintiff may
apply for a right to attach order by noticing a hearing for the order and
serving the defendant with summons and complaint, notice of the application,
and supporting papers any time after filing the complaint.  CCP §484.010. 
Notice of the application must be given pursuant to CCP section 1005,
sixteen court days before the hearing.  See
ibid.
The notice of the
application and the application may be made on Judicial Council forms (Optional
Forms AT-105, 115).  The application must
be supported by an affidavit showing that the plaintiff on the facts presented
would be entitled to a judgment on the claim upon which the attachment is
based.  CCP §484.030.  
Where the defendant
is a corporation, a general reference to “all corporate property which is
subject to attachment pursuant to subdivision (a) of Code of Civil Procedure
Section 487.010” is sufficient.  CCP
§484.020(e).  Where the defendant is a
partnership or other unincorporated association, a reference to “all property
of the partnership or other unincorporated association which is subject to
attachment pursuant to subdivision (b) of Code of Civil Procedure Section 487.010”
is sufficient.  CCP §484.020(e).  A specific description of property is not
required for corporations and partnerships as they generally have no exempt
property.  Bank of America v. Salinas
Nissan, Inc., (“Bank of America”) (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 268.
A defendant who
opposes issuance of the order must file and serve a notice of opposition and
supporting affidavit as required by CCP section 484.060 not later than five
court days prior to the date set for hearing. 
CCP §484.050(e).  The notice of
opposition may be made on a Judicial Council form (Optional Form AT-155).  
The plaintiff may
file and serve a reply two court days prior to the date set for the
hearing.  CCP §484.060(c). 
At the hearing, the
court determines whether the plaintiff should receive a right to attach order
and whether any property which the plaintiff seeks to attach is exempt from
attachment.  The defendant may appear the
hearing.  CCP §484.050(h).  The court generally will evaluate the
attachment application based solely on the pleadings and supporting affidavits
without taking additional evidence.  Bank
of America, supra, 207 Cal.App.3d at 273.  A verified complaint may be used in lieu of
or in addition to an affidavit if it states evidentiary facts.  CCP §482.040. 
The plaintiff has the burden of proof, and the court is not required to
accept as true any affidavit even if it is undisputed.  See Bank of America, supra, at
271, 273.
The court may issue
a right to attach order (Optional Form AT-120) if the plaintiff shows all of
the following: (1) the claim on which the attachment is based is one on which
an attachment may be issued (CCP §484.090(a)(1)); (2) the plaintiff has established
the probable validity of the claim (CCP §484.090(a)(2)); (3) attachment is
sought for no purpose other than the recovery on the subject claim (CCP
§484.090(a)(3); and (4) the amount to be secured by the attachment is greater
than zero (CCP §484.090(a)(4)). 
A claim has
“probable validity” where it is more likely than not that the plaintiff will
recover on that claim.  CCP §481.190.  In determining this issue, the court must
consider the relative merits of the positions of the respective parties.  Kemp Bros. Construction, Inc. v. Titan
Electric Corp., (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1474, 1484.  The court does not determine whether the
claim is actually valid; that determination will be made at trial and is not
affected by the decision on the application for the order.  CCP §484.050(b).
Except in unlawful
detainer actions, the amount to be secured by the attachment is the sum of (1)
the amount of the defendant’s indebtedness claimed by the plaintiff, and (2)
any additional amount included by the court for estimate of costs and any allowable
attorneys’ fees under CCP section 482.110. 
CCP §483.015(a); Goldstein v. Barak Construction, (2008) 164
Cal.App.4th 845, 852.  This amount must
be reduced by the sum of (1) the amount of indebtedness that the defendant has
in a money judgment against plaintiff, (2) the amount claimed in a
cross-complaint or affirmative defense and shown would be subject to attachment
against the plaintiff, and (3) the value of any security interest held by the
plaintiff in the defendant’s property, together with the amount by which the
acts of the plaintiff (or a prior holder of the security interest) have
decreased that security interest’s value. 
CCP §483.015(b); see also CCP §483.010(b) (“an attachment may not be
issued on a claim which is secured by any interest in real property arising
from agreement, statute, or other rule of law…However, an attachment may be
issued where the claim was originally so secured but, without any act of the
plaintiff or the person to whom the security was given, the security has become
valueless or has decreased in value to less than the amount then owing on the
claim).  A defendant claiming that the
amount to be secured should be reduced because of a cross-claim or affirmative
defense must make a prima facie showing that the claim would result in an
attachment against the plaintiff.
Before the issuance
of a writ of attachment, the plaintiff is required to file an undertaking to
pay the defendant any amount the defendant may recover for any wrongful attachment
by the plaintiff in the action.  CCP
§489.210.  The undertaking ordinarily is
$10,000. CCP §489.220.  If the defendant
objects, the court may increase the amount of undertaking to the amount
determined as the probable recovery for wrongful attachment.  CCP §489.220. 
The court also has inherent authority to increase the amount of the
undertaking sua sponte.  North
Hollywood Marble Co. v. Superior Court, (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 683, 691.
 
C. Statement of Facts[1]
1. Background 
            The Netflix Parties and
Debtors were parties to a written Term Sheet dated November 12, 2018 (the “Term
Sheet”).  Burrow Decl., ¶4.  In the Term Sheet, Debtors agreed to deliver
“[t]he project currently referred to as ‘Conquest’ (aka ‘White Horse’)
inclusive of… [a]ll existing scripts and episodes for the first season of
episodes of the Series comprised of approximately 13 episodes ranging from
approximately 4 to 14 minutes in length and totaling 110-120 minutes.”  Burrow Decl., ¶4, Ex. A.  The Term Sheet required that the parties
resolve any claims arising from the Term Sheet through binding arbitration with
ADR Services, Inc.  Burrow Decl.,
¶5.  
 
            2. The Arbitration Award 
            The Netflix Parties and
Debtors engaged in arbitration proceedings at ADR Services, Inc. with the Hon.
Rita Miller (Ret.) (the “Arbitrator”) presiding, on the following dates:
November 6-10, 2023; November 13-17, 2023; December 13-15, 2023; and January
14, 2024.  Burrow Decl., ¶6.  
On May 30, 2024, the
Arbitrator issued an Interim Award in favor of Netflix and Ice Cream and
against Rinsch and Home VFX.  Burrow
Decl., ¶7.  In the Interim Award, the
Arbitrator found that: (a) Rinsch and Home VFX failed to prove their claims and
were not entitled to any recovery or the declaration they requested; and (b) Netflix
and Ice Cream proved their counterclaim for breach of contract and were
entitled to recover damages in the amount of $8,783,705.06, imposition of a
constructive trust over the footage of Conquest in the control of Rinsch and
Home VFX, and the declaration Netflix and Ice Cream requested in their third
counterclaim.  Burrow Decl., ¶7, Ex. B. 
            As set forth in the
Interim Award, Rinsch is a writer, director and producer, and the CEO of Home
VFX, and Rinsch and Home VFX breached the Term Sheet relating to a science
fiction series called Conquest (previously known as White Horse).  Burrow Decl., ¶8, Ex. B.  The contract claim asserted by Netflix and
Ice Cream in the counterclaim they filed in the Arbitration against Rinsch
related to his conduct of a trade, business, or profession.  Burrow Decl., ¶8.  
            On August 1, 2024, the
Arbitrator issued an Order awarding Netflix and Ice Cream their attorneys’ fees
in the amount of $2,902,234.21 and costs in the amount of $133,918.52.  Burrow Decl., ¶9, Ex. C.   
            On August 2, 2024, the
Arbitrator issued the Final Award, which incorporates by reference her May 30,
2024 Interim Award and August 1, 2024 Order and awards Netflix and Ice Cream
damages in the amount of $8,783,705.06 as stated in the Interim Award, plus
attorneys’ fees in the amount of $2,902,234.21 as stated in the August 1, 2024
Order, plus costs in the amount of $133,918.52, plus a constructive trust over
the Conquest/White Horse footage in the custody or control of Home VFX.  Burrow Decl., ¶10, Ex. D. 
 
            3. Rinsch’s Assets
            Upon being retained, the
Netflix Parties’ counsel immediately started conducting asset searches for
Rinsch and Home VFX.  Bloom Decl.,
¶6.  Respondents’ counsel engaged the
services of private investigators to assist in locating assets.  Bloom Decl., ¶6.  The work being conducted by the private
investigators is ongoing and protected by the attorney work product doctrine.  Bloom Decl., ¶6.  Based on Respondents’ counsel’s past
experience in enforcing judgments and obtaining right to attach orders /writs
of attachment, debtors almost always move assets if they learn that a creditor
is seeking to seize such assets.  Bloom
Decl., ¶6.  Accordingly, Respondents describe
the assets sought to be attached from Rinsch in very general terms.  Bloom Decl., ¶6.  
            Rinsch has listed his
assets, including his bank accounts, in court filings made in connection with
his pending divorce.  Bloom Decl., ¶7,
Ex. E.  
 
D. Analysis
Respondents
Netflix Parties seek right to attach orders against Petitioners Rinsch and Home VFX in the amount of $12,019,857.80.     
1. A Claim Based on a Contract and on Which Attachment
May Be Based 
            A writ of attachment may be issued
only in an action on a claim or claims for money, each of which is based upon a
contract, express or implied, where the total amount of the claim or claims is
a fixed or readily ascertainable amount not less than five hundred dollars
($500).  CCP §483.010(a).  
            Respondents’ claim for attachment is
based on the Arbitrator’s Final Award and exceeds $500.
             
            2. An Amount Due That is Fixed
and Readily Ascertainable  
            A claim is “readily ascertainable”
where the damages may be readily ascertained by reference to the contract and
the basis of the calculation appears to be reasonable and definite.  CIT
Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v. Super DVD, Inc., (“CIT”) (2004)
115 Cal.App.4th 537, 540-41.  The fact that the damages are unliquidated
is not determinative.  Id.  But the contract must furnish a
standard by which the amount may be ascertained and there must be a basis by
which the damages can be determined by proof.  Id. (citations
omitted). 
            The amount sought for attachment is
based on the Arbitrator’s Final Award in the amount of $12,019,857.80.   This amount is fixed
and readily ascertainable.
 
            3. Probability of Success 
            A claim has “probable validity”
where it is more likely than not that the plaintiff will recover on that
claim.  CCP §481.190.  In determining this issue, the court must
consider the relative merits of the positions of the respective parties.  Kemp
Bros. Construction, Inc. v. Titan Electric Corp., (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th
1474, 1484.  The court does not determine whether the claim is actually
valid; that determination will be made at trial and is not affected by the
decision on the application for the order.  CCP §484.050(b).
The Netflix Parties obtained
a nearly $12 million arbitration award against Debtors.  The arbitration was conducted pursuant to a
contractual arbitration clause, and the Final Award includes an award of
attorneys’ fees and costs.  This award
has been confirmed by the I/C court.  All
that remains is entry of judgment.  
The Netflix Parties
have shown a probability of success.
            
4. Attachment Sought for a Proper Purpose¿ 
            Attachment must not be sought for a
purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon which attachment is based.¿
CCP §484.090(a)(3).  
Debtors have not
made any payments toward satisfying the arbitration award.  To the contrary, Debtors filed a petition to
vacate the award.  The Netflix Parties
are concerned that Debtors may dissipate assets before final judgment is
entered.  This is a proper purpose for
attachment.
 
5. Attachment Is
Based on a Commercial Claim
If the action is against a defendant who is a natural
person, an attachment may be issued only on a commercial claim which arises out
of the defendant’s conduct of a trade, business, or profession.  CCP §483.010(c).  Consumer transactions cannot form a basis for
attachment.   CCP §483.010(c); Kadison,
Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn & Rossi v. Wilson, (1987) 197 Cal.App.3d 1, 4
(action involving trust property was a commercial, not a consumer,
transaction).
Rinsch is a writer,
director and producer, and the CEO of Home VFX. 
Burrow Decl., ¶8, Ex. B.  The
contract claim asserted by the Netflix Parties in the Arbitration related to
his conduct of a trade, business, or profession.  Burrow Decl., ¶8.  
 
6. Rinsch’s
Property Is Adequately Described
Where the defendant is a natural person, the description of
the property must be reasonably adequate to permit the defendant to identify
the specific property sought to be attached. 
CCP §484.020(e).  Although the
property must be specifically described, the plaintiff may target for
attachment everything the individual defendant owns.  Bank of America v. Salinas Nissan, Inc.,
(1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 268.
            The application seeks general
categories of Rinsch’s assets while listing their specific nature pursuant to
CCP section 484.020.  This suffices.
Debtors also have
pending lawsuits against third parties, and the Netflix Parties also seeks an order
that includes the right for them to create liens in those actions pursuant to
CCP section 491.410.  Without such
relief, Debtors could recover money in one or more of those actions and then
spend the money prior to judgment being entered herein.  Mem. at 8-9. 
The request is granted.
 
7. Ineffectual
Relief
CCP section 1281.8(b) (“section 1281.8") provides that
a party to an arbitration agreement may apply to the court for provisional
relief in connection with an arbitrable controversy, but only upon the ground
that the award may be rendered ineffectual without provisional relief.  The requirements of CCP section 1281.8 are in
addition to the other elements of proof for provisioinal relief.  See Woolley v. Embassy Suites, Inc.,
(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 1520, 1529 (applying section 1281.8 to preliminary
injunction).  The “ineffectual” element
exists to ensure that the court does not invade the province of the arbitrator;
the court is empowered to grant relief only where the arbitrator’s award may be
inadequate to make the moving party whole. 
California Retail Portfolio Fund GMBH & Co. v. Hopkins Real
Estate Group, (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 849, 856 (citing Woolley).  In the context of attachment, the irreparable
harm requirement for ex parte attachment provides guidance on the issue
of, and is similar to, ineffectual relief under section 1281.8.  Id. at 859.  This includes both insolvency and the
inability to otherwise pay damages that might be awarded in the
arbitration.  Ibid.  
The status of this case is that an Arbitration Award has
been issued and confirmed by the I/C court. 
All that remains is entry of judgment before the Netflix Parties can
collect.  
The Netflix Parties argue that it has been over two years since the arbitration was filed, and Rinsch
reportedly has a propensity to go on spending sprees.  Rinsch has also declared, under penalty of
perjury in his divorce action, that he has no income.  Bloom Decl., ¶9, Ex. E, p.2.  Before Debtors dissipate more assets, and
while the Netflix Parties await entry of judgment, they seek right to attach orders
so they can ensure that their arbitration award is not rendered ineffective in
the interim.  Mem. at 1.
The Neflix Parties’
evidence of ineffectual relief is weak, based only on Rinsch’s assertion that
he has no income and an argument that he has a reputation of dissipating
assets.  Nonetheless, Debtors do not
oppose, and the period of any pre-judgment attachment should be brief.
 
E. Conclusion
The applications for right
to attach orders against Petitioners Rinsch and Home VFX in the amount of $12,019,857.80 are granted.  A $10,000 bond will be required for each
Defendant before a writ of attachment may be issued against that
Defendant.  The Netflix Parties have not
submitted right to attach orders on the appropriate Judicial Council form and
are ordered to do so in two court days or they will be deemed waived.
