John Deere Construction and
Forestry Company v. LFG Arbor Care, Inc. and Luis Fernando Garcia, 24STLC04511

Tentative decision on application for
writ of possession:   granted




 



Plaintiff John Deere Construction and Forestry Company
(“John Deere”) seeks a writ of possession against Defendant LFG Arbor Care,
Inc. (“Arbor”) and Luis Fernando Garcia (“Garcia”) to recover a VERMEER SC-382
STUMP CHIPPERS ID:1VRU112BCN1001542 ("Equipment”). 
The court has read and considered the moving papers (no
opposition was filed) and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
A. Statement of
the Case
1. Complaint 
On June  24, 2024,
Plaintiff John Deere filed the Complaint against Defendants Arbor and Garcia,
alleging causes of action for breach of contract and claim and delivery.  The Complaint alleges in pertinent part as
follows.
 
a. Breach of Contract
On April 25, 2022, Defendants executed a Retail Installment
Contract- Security Agreement (“Contract”) with Plaintiff for the purchase of the
Equipment.  Defendants promised to pay
the financed amount of $38,825.97, payable by thirty-six (36) equal monthly
payments of $1,270.50 beginning May 25, 2022. 
The Contract provides that, in the event of a default, the entire unpaid
balance may be declared immediately due and payable at the option of the
holder.  
On April 25, 2023, Defendants defaulted in making the
payments as agreed.   By reason thereof,
the entire unpaid balance of the Contract was declared due and payable.  Plaintiff has performed all conditions and
covenants of the Contract except those as excused by Defendants' breach.   Despite the fact that demand has been made
upon Defendants, no part thereof has been paid and there is now due and owing
an unpaid balance of $33,466.72.  
 
b. Claim and Delivery 
Plaintiff is entitled to return of the Equipment because
Plaintiff has a security interest in the Equipment and the Contract is in
default.  Although Plaintiff has
repeatedly requested that Defendants surrender the Equipment, Defendants have
refused to do so.    
 
2. Course of Proceedings 
Proofs of service on file show that (1) Defendant Arbor was
served with Summons and Complaint by substitute service on August 6, 2024 and served
with the moving papers by substitute service on October 10, 2024 and that (2) Defendant
Garcia was served with Summons and Complaint by substitute service on July 22,
2024 and served with the moving papers by substitute service on October 10,
2024
 
B. Applicable Law
A writ of possession is issued as a provisional remedy in a
cause of action for claim and delivery, also known as replevin.  See
Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro v. Schectman, (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1279,
1288.  As a provisional remedy, the right
to possession is only temporary, and title and the right to possess are
determined in the final judgment.  
            A
writ of possession is available in any pending action.  It also is available where an action has been
stayed pending arbitration, so long as the arbitration award may be ineffectual
without provisional relief.  See CCP §1281.7. 
 
            1. Procedure
            Upon
the filing of the complaint or at any time thereafter, a plaintiff may apply
for an order for a writ of possession. 
Unlike attachment, where Judicial Council forms are optional, the
parties must use the mandatory approved Judicial Council forms in a claim and
delivery proceeding.  (Judicial Council
Forms CD-100 et seq.).
            A
plaintiff must make a written application for a writ of possession.  CCP §512.010(a), (b); (Mandatory Form
CD-100); CCP §512.010(a).  A verified
complaint alone is insufficient.  6
Witkin, California Procedure, (5th ed. 2008) §255, p.203.  The application may be supported by
declarations and/or a verified complaint. 
CCP §516.030.  The declarations or
complaint must set forth admissible evidence except where expressly permitted
to be shown on information and belief.  Id.
            The
application must be executed under oath and include: (1) A showing of the basis
of the plaintiff's claim and that the plaintiff is entitled to possession of
the property claimed.  If the plaintiff's
claim is based on a written instrument, a copy of it must be attached; (2) A
showing that the property is wrongfully detained by the defendant, how the
defendant came into possession of it, and, the reasons for the detention based
on the plaintiff’s best knowledge, information, and belief; (3) A specific description
of the property and statement of its value; (4) The location of the property
according to the plaintiff’s best knowledge, information, and belief.  If the property, or some part of it, is
within a private place which may have to be entered to take possession, a
showing of probable cause to believe that the property is located there; and
(5) A statement that the property has not been taken for (a) a tax, assessment,
or fine, pursuant to a statute, or (b) an execution against the plaintiff’s
property.  Alternatively, a statement
that if the property was seized for one of these purposes, it is by statute
exempt from such seizure.  CCP
§512.010(b).
 
            2. The Hearing
            Before
noticing a hearing, the plaintiff must serve the defendant with all of the
following: (1) A copy of the summons and complaint; (2) A Notice of Application
and Hearing; and (3) A copy of the application and any supporting declaration.  CCP §512.030(a).  If the defendant has not appeared in the
action, service must be made in the same manner as service of summons and
complaint.  CCP §512.030(b).
            Each
party shall file with the court and serve upon the other party any declarations
and points and authorities intended to be relied upon at the hearing.  CCP §512.050. 
At the hearing, the court decides the merits of the application based on
the pleadings and declarations.   Id.  Upon a showing of good cause, the court may
receive and consider additional evidence and authority presented at the hearing
or may continue the hearing for the production of such additional evidence,
oral or documentary, or the filing of other affidavits or points and
authorities.  Id.  
            The
court may order issuance of a writ of possession if both of the following are
found: (1) The plaintiff has established the probable validity of the
plaintiff’s claim to possession of the property; and (2) The undertaking
requirements of CCP section 515.010 are satisfied.  CCP §512.060(a).  “A claim has ‘probable validity’ where it is
more likely than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the
defendant on that claim.”  CCP
§511.090.  This requires that the
plaintiff establish a prima facie case; the writ shall not issue if the
defendant shows a reasonable probability of a successful defense to the claim
and delivery cause of action.  Witkin,
California Procedure, (5th ed. 2008) §261, p.208.  A defendant’s claim of defect in the property
is not a defense to the plaintiff’s right to possess it.  RCA Service Co. v. Superior Court,
(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 1, 3.
            No
writ directing the levying officer to enter a private place to take possession
of any property may be issued unless the plaintiff has established that there
is probable cause to believe that the property is located there.  CCP §512.060(b).  
            The
successful plaintiff may obtain a preliminary injunction containing the same
provisions as a TRO that remains in effect until the property is seized by the
levying officer.[1]  CCP §513.010(c).  
            The
court may also issue a “turnover order” directing the defendant to transfer
possession of the property to the plaintiff (See Mandatory Form CD-120). 
The order must notify the defendant that failure to comply may subject
him or her to contempt of court.  CCP
§512.070.  The turnover remedy is not
issued in lieu of a writ, but in conjunction with it to provide the plaintiff
with a less expensive means of obtaining possession.  See
Edwards v Superior Court, (“Edwards”) (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 173,
178.
 
            3. The Plaintiff’s Undertaking
            Generally,
the court cannot issue an order for a writ of possession until the plaintiff
has filed an undertaking with the court (Mandatory Form CD-140 for personal
sureties).  CCP §515.010(a).  The undertaking shall provide that the
sureties are bound to the defendant for the return of the property to the
defendant, if return of the property is ordered, and for the payment to the
defendant of any sum recovered against the plaintiff.  Id. 
The undertaking shall be in an amount not less than twice the value of
the defendant's interest in the property or in a greater amount.  Id. 
The value of the defendant's interest in the property is determined by
the market value of the property less the amount due and owing on any
conditional sales contract or security agreement and all liens and encumbrances
on the property, and any other factors necessary to determine the defendant’s
interest in the property.  Id.
            However,
where the defendant has no interest in the property, the court must waive the requirement
of the plaintiff’s undertaking and include in the order for issuance of the
writ the amount of the defendant’s undertaking sufficient to satisfy the
requirements of CCP section 515.020(b).  CCP
§515.010(b). 
 
C. Statement of Facts
            On April 25, 2022,
Defendants executed a Contract with Plaintiff for the purchase and financing of
the Equipment.  Johnson Decl., ¶4;
Johnson Decl., Ex. A.  Defendants
promised to pay the financed amount of $38,825.97.  Johnson Decl., ¶4.  Plaintiff has a security interest in the
Equipment pursuant to the Contract. 
Johnson Decl., ¶5.  
Plaintiff's security
interest in the Equipment was perfected by the filing of a UCC- 1 Financing
Statement with the Secretary of State. 
Johnson Decl., ¶5; Johnson Decl., Ex. B. 
the Contract contains an acceleration clause.  Johnson Decl., ¶6.  In the event of default, Plaintiff may
recover "the Account Balance as of the date of such default, without
presentment or demand or notice of intention to declare all of that
indebtedness immediately due and payable ...”  Johnson Decl., ¶6; Johnson Decl., Ex. A.  
            On April 25, 2023,
Defendants were in default on the payment obligations under the Contract.  Johnson Decl., ¶7.  Plaintiff declared the entire unpaid balance
on the Contract due and payable pursuant to the acceleration clause in the
Contract.  Johnson Decl., ¶7.  Plaintiff has performed all conditions and
covenants of the Contract except those as excused by Defendants' breach.  Johnson Decl., ¶7.  Despite that the demand was made upon
Defendants, no part thereof has been paid, and there is now due and owing an
unpaid balance of $33,466.72.  Johnson
Decl., ¶7.  
            The total current retail
value of the Equipment is estimated to be $28,284.00.  Johnson Decl., ¶8.  This estimate is based on internal data
compiled by Plaintiff's remarketing department. 
Johnson Decl., ¶8.  That data
includes, but is not limited to, references to current sales of similar
equipment in the market, historical sales and market conditions, and experience
monitoring equipment repossession and sales of similar equipment.  Johnson Decl., ¶8; Johnson Decl., Ex. C.  
            Plaintiff has a right to
immediate possession of the Equipment pursuant to the terms of the Contract.  Johnson Decl., ¶9.  The Contract provides, "[w]e may
determine you to be in default if: (a) you fail to remit to us any Installment
Payment or other payment when due;…If we determine that you are in default, we
may do one or more of the following: (d) require you to deliver the Equipment
to us in the manner outlined below or take possession of the Equipment."  Johnson Decl., ¶9; Johnson Decl., Ex. A.  
            Defendants acquired
possession of the Equipment for business purposes, and it is not necessary for
the support of the Defendants or Defendants' families because this type of
equipment is widely available to rent, lease or purchase in the current market.  Johnson Decl., ¶10.  
            Since the time of
Defendants' default, Plaintiff repeatedly attempted to regain possession of the
Equipment and Defendants have refused to surrender it.  Johnson Decl., ¶12.  On December 18, 2023, Plaintiff's
repossession agents made contact with Defendant Garcia who finally agreed to
surrender the Equipment.  Johnson Decl.,
¶12.  The Equipment was present when
Plaintiff's agents arrived at the 8526 International Avenue, Apt 62, Canoga
Park, CA 91304 address to pick up the Equipment.  Johnson Decl., ¶12.  Thereafter, Defendant would not return
Plaintiff's agent's phone calls.  Johnson
Decl., ¶12.  The address for Defendants
on the Contract is 8526 International Avenue, Apt 62, Canoga Park, CA 91304.  Johnson Decl., ¶12.  
            
D. Analysis
Plaintiff John Deere
applies for an order for a writ of possession of the Equipment against Defendants
Arbor and Garcia.[2]
 No opposition is on file.
 
1. Probable Validity
On April 25, 2022,
Defendants executed a Contract with Plaintiff for the purchase and financing of
the Equipment.  Johnson Decl., ¶4;
Johnson Decl., Ex. A.  Defendants
promised to pay the financed amount of $38,825.97.  Johnson Decl., ¶4.  Plaintiff has a security interest in the
Equipment pursuant to the Contract. 
Johnson Decl., ¶5.  Plaintiff's
security interest in the Equipment was perfected by the filing of a UCC- 1
Financing Statement with the Secretary of State.  Johnson Decl., ¶5; Johnson Decl., Ex. B.  
            On April 25, 2023,
Defendants were in default on the payment obligations under the Contract.  Johnson Decl., ¶7.  Plaintiff declared the entire unpaid balance
on the Contract due and payable pursuant to the acceleration clause in the
Contract.  Johnson Decl., ¶7.  Plaintiff has performed all conditions and
covenants of the Contract except those as excused by Defendants' breach.  Johnson Decl., ¶7.  Despite that the demand was made upon
Defendants, no part thereof has been paid, and there is now due and owing an
unpaid balance of $33,466.72.  Johnson
Decl., ¶7.  
The declaration supporting an application for a writ of
possession must be set forth with particularity.  CCP §516.030. 
This means that the plaintiff must show evidentiary facts rather than
the ultimate facts commonly found in pleadings. 
A recitation of conclusions without a foundation of evidentiary facts is
insufficient.  See Rodes v.
Shannon, (1961) 194 Cal.App.2d 743, 749 (declaration containing conclusions
inadequate for summary judgment); Schessler v. Keck, (1956) 138
Cal.App.2d 663, 669 (same).  The
declaration must also affirmatively show the declarant’s competency to
testify to the facts.  CCP §516.030.  At a minimum, the declaration must show how
the declarant knows the facts; boilerplate recitations that the declarant has
personal knowledge are inadequate.  See
Snider v. Snider, (1962) 200 Cal.App.2d 741, 754 (boilerplate recitation
of personal knowledge insufficient without additional foundation showing how he
or she knew). 
Plaintiff John Deere fails to meet this particularity
requirement to support the amount owed as $33,466.72.  No loan history or evidentiary detail is
provide to show the accuracy of this amount, which is important for the issue
of undertaking.  As no opposition is on
file, this defect is waived.
Plaintiff John Deere has established the probable validity
of its claim to possession of the Vehicle. 
CCP §§ 511.090, 512.060(a).  
 
2. Undertaking
            The
undertaking required by CCP section 515.010(a) is an amount not less than twice
the value of the defendant's interest in the property or in a greater
amount.  Id.  The value of the defendant's interest in the
property is determined by the market value of the property less the amount due
and owing on any conditional sales contract or security agreement and all liens
and encumbrances on the property.  Id.  
The Equipment’s fair market value is $28,284.  Johnson Decl., ¶8.  The unpaid principal balance is
currently $33,466,72.
The amount owed exceeds the market value exceeds the amount
owed by $5182.72.  No undertaking is
required.  The re-delivery bond will be $33,466.72.  CCP §515.020(a).
 
3. Location of the Vehicle
John Deere presents
evidence that the Equipment is located at 8526 International Avenue, Apt 62,
Canoga Park, CA 91304.  Johnson Decl.,
¶12.  The levying officer may
enter this location to recover the Equipment. 
CCP §512.060(b).  
 
E. Conclusion
The application for an order for a writ of possession of the
Equipment against Defendants Arbor
and Garcia is granted.  No undertaking is required.  The re-delivery bond shall be $33466.72.
