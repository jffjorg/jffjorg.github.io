Anbang Group Holdings
Co. Limited, AB Stable IX LLC, and AB Stable VIII LLC v. Amer Group LLC, Amer
Group Inc, and Worldtsing LLC, 24STCV24832 
Tentative decision on application for preliminary injunction:   granted



 
 
             
Plaintiffs Anbang Group Holdings Co. Limited, AB Stable IX
LLC, and AB Stable VIII LLC (collectively, “Anbang”) apply for a preliminary
injunction to enjoin Defendants Amer Group LLC, Amer Group Inc, and Worldtsing
LLC (“Worldstsing”) from transferring or encumbering title to real property
located in Malibu, County of Los Angeles, California, bearing the Assessor’s
Parcel Number 4473-002-010 (the “Property”). 
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, the opposition presented at
the TRO hearing, and reply, and renders the following tentative decision. 
            
            A.
Statement of the Case
            1.
The Complaint
            Plaintiffs
Anbang filed the Complaint on September 24, 2024, for (1) Cancellation of
Written Instrument, (2) Fraudulent Conveyance, (3) Declaratory Relief, and (4) Injunctive
Relief.  The Complaint alleges in
pertinent part as follows.
            Plaintiffs
bring this action to cancel a fraudulent grant deed for real property owned by Defendant
Amer Group LLC, a Delaware entity and judgment debtor of Plaintiffs.  Amer Group LLC owes Plaintiffs over $14.5
million in damages from a federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (“RICO”) lawsuit that was decided in April of 2024 against
Amer Group LLC’s sole owner Haibin Zhou (“Zhou”), and several related entities
(the “RICO Action”). 
            Defendants
Amer Group LLC, its owner Zhou, and numerous affiliated entities and
coconspirators carried out a fraudulent scheme aimed at falsely claiming
ownership over billions of dollars in luxury real estate properties owned by
Plaintiffs.  As part of that scheme, in
2018, entities including Amer Group LLC filed false grant deeds in Los Angeles
County, San Francisco County, and San Mateo County purporting to transfer to
themselves Plaintiffs’ luxury properties.  Zhou was the owner and sole controller of those
entities, including Amer.  
In September 2019, Plaintiffs filed quiet title actions in
four California counties to clear title to their luxury properties.  None of the Defendants appeared in the cases,
and Plaintiffs prevailed through default judgments in each of them.   
            Between
2019 and 2022, Amer Group LLC and its co-conspirators also filed numerous
lawsuits through which they attempted to confirm several fake arbitration
awards against Plaintiffs and/or their affiliates—totaling nearly $1 trillion
dollars—based on a forged and fake “agreement” purportedly between Plaintiffs
and Amer, among others.  Plaintiffs
and/or their affiliates prevailed in litigation in Delaware, Alameda County,
California, the District of Columbia, and New York. 
            On
March 5, 2023, Plaintiffs commenced the RICO Action against Amer Group LLC,
Zhou, and their co-conspirators, asserting claims for violations of RICO (18
U.S.C. §1962(c)) and Conspiracy to Commit RICO (18 U.S.C. §1962(d)), based on
predicate acts of mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. section 1341, wire fraud
in violation of 18 U.S.C. section 1343, and attempted extortion in violation of
the Hobbs Act (18 U.S.C. §1951).  Although
duly served, none of Zhou, Amer Group LLC, or any other of the entities controlled
by Zhou appeared in the RICO Action.  Other
defendants did appear and Plaintiffs took extensive discovery from participants
in the scheme.  In the course of the RICO
Action, Plaintiffs proved that Zhou operates through multiple aliases and
personas (including “Mike Butler” and “Andy Bang”), uses multiple email
addresses and shell companies, and has a history of filing false deeds and fake
judgments while subsequently failing to appear in court to defend his filings.   A
default judgment was entered against Amer Group LLC in the RICO Action on April
4, 2024.  
Amer Group LLC has attempted to thwart Plaintiffs’ attempts
to collect on the RICO Judgment.  On
April 11, 2024, just days after the RICO Judgment was entered, Amer Group Inc filed
a false grant deed (“False Deed”) with the Los Angeles County Recorder’s
Office.  The False Deed falsely states
that it is a “Reconveyance upon satisfaction of a debt” under section 11911 of
the California Revenue and Taxation Code.  
Amer Group Inc is a shell entity owned by Zhou, and
Defendants filed the False Deed immediately after the RICO Judgment was entered
to place the Property into the hands of a non-judgment debtor affiliate of Amer
Group LLC and out of the reach of Plaintiffs’ lawful judgment enforcement
efforts.
Upon information and belief, Plaintiffs allege that (a) the
False Deed contains a forged signature of “Sang Yan,” who is falsely described
as a “Trustee” of Amer Group Inc and (b) the Acknowledgement of the notary
public included with the False Deed is a photocopy of an identical notarial
Acknowledgment included with a completely different property filing in a
different county.  
The False Deed also falsely implies that Amer Group Inc owned
the Property, or some interest in it, and transferred the Property to
Worldtsing LLC by virtue of the False Deed.  In fact, the Property was transferred from S&A
Freshman Family Properties, LLC to Amer Group LLC in January of 2011 and was
never transferred at any time thereafter.  
            
            2. Course of Proceedings
            On
September 24, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the Complaint and Summons. 
            Proofs
of service on file show that Defendant Amer Group LLC was served with Summons
and Complaint on September 27 and 30, 2024, Defendant Amer Group Inc was served
with Summons and Complaint on September 27, 2024, and Worldtsing was served
with Summons and Complaint on September 27, 2024.
On September 30, 2024, the court granted Plaintiffs’ ex parte
application for a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) and order to show cause
for a preliminary injunction (“OSC”).  Proofs of service on file show that Defendants
Amer Group Inc, Amer Group LLC, and Worldtsing were served with the TRO/OSC on
October 3, 2024.
            
            B.
Applicable Law
            An
injunction is a writ or order requiring a person to refrain from a particular
act; it may be granted by the court in which the action is brought, or by a
judge thereof; and when granted by a judge, it may be enforced as an order of
the court.  Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”)
§525.  An injunction may be more
completely defined as a writ or order commanding a person either to perform or
to refrain from performing a particular act. 
See Comfort v. Comfort, (1941) 17 Cal.2d 736, 741. McDowell
v. Watson, (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1155, 1160.[1]  It is an equitable remedy available generally
in the protection or to prevent the invasion of a legal right.  Meridian, Ltd. v. City and County of San
Francisco, et al., (1939) 13 Cal.2d 424.
            The
purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo
pending final resolution upon a trial.  See
Scaringe v. J.C.C. Enterprises, Inc., (1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 1536. Grothe
v. Cortlandt Corp., (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1313, 1316; Major v. Miraverde
Homeowners Assn., (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 618, 623.  The status quo has been defined to
mean the last actual peaceable, uncontested status which preceded the pending
controversy.  Voorhies v. Greene
(1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 989, 995, quoting United Railroads v. Superior Court,
(1916) 172 Cal. 80, 87. 14859 Moorpark Homeowner’s Assn. v. VRT Corp.,
(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1396. 1402.
            A
preliminary injunction is issued after hearing on a noticed motion.  The complaint normally must plead injunctive
relief.  CCP §526(a)(1)-(2).[2]  Preliminary injunctive relief requires the
use of competent evidence to create a sufficient factual showing on the grounds
for relief.  See e.g. Ancora-Citronelle
Corp. v. Green, (1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 146, 150.  Injunctive relief may be granted based on a
verified complaint only if it contains sufficient evidentiary, not ultimate,
facts.  See CCP §527(a).  For this reason, a pleading alone rarely
suffices.  Weil & Brown, California
Procedure Before Trial, 9:579, 9(ll)-21 (The Rutter Group 2007).  The burden of proof is on the plaintiff as
moving party.  O’Connell v. Superior
Court, (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1452, 1481. 
            A
plaintiff seeking injunctive relief must show the absence of an adequate
damages remedy at law.  CCP §526(4); Thayer
Plymouth Center, Inc. v. Chrysler Motors, (1967) 255 Cal.App.2d 300, 307; Department
of Fish & Game v. Anderson-Cottonwood Irrigation Dist., (1992) 8
Cal.App.4th 1554, 1565.  The concept of
“inadequacy of the legal remedy” or “inadequacy of damages” dates from the time
of the early courts of chancery, the idea being that an injunction is an
unusual or extraordinary equitable remedy which will not be granted if the
remedy at law (usually damages) will adequately compensate the injured
plaintiff.  Department of Fish &
Game v. Anderson-Cottonwood Irrigation Dist., (1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 1554,
1565.
            In
determining whether to issue a preliminary injunction, the trial court
considers two factors: (1) the reasonable probability that the plaintiff will
prevail on the merits at trial (CCP §526(a)(1)), and (2) a balancing of the
“irreparable harm” that the plaintiff is likely to sustain if the injunction is
denied as compared to the harm that the defendant is likely to suffer if the
court grants a preliminary injunction. 
CCP §526(a)(2); 14859 Moorpark Homeowner’s Assn. v. VRT Corp.,
(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1396. 1402; Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro v.
Schectman, (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1283; Davenport v. Blue Cross of
California, (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 435, 446; Abrams v. St. Johns Hospital,
(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 628, 636.  Thus, a
preliminary injunction may not issue without some showing of potential
entitlement to such relief.  Doe v.
Wilson, (1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 296, 304. 
The decision to grant a preliminary injunction generally lies within the
sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent
an abuse of discretion.  Thornton v.
Carlson, (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 1249, 1255.
            A
preliminary injunction ordinarily cannot take effect unless and until the
plaintiff provides an undertaking for damages which the enjoined defendant may
sustain by reason of the injunction if the court finally decides that the
plaintiff was not entitled to the injunction. 
See CCP §529(a); City of South San Francisco v. Cypress Lawn
Cemetery Assn., (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 916, 920.
 
            C.
Statement of Facts
Amer Group LLC, a Delaware entity, owes Plaintiffs over
$14.5 million in damages from the RICO Action decided against it, its sole
owner Haibin Zhou (“Zhou”), and several related entities (Anbang Group Holdings
Co. Ltd., et al. v. Zhou, et al., No.
23-cv-00998 (N.D. Cal.).  Wagner Decl.,
¶¶ 3-4, Ex. B.  As part of their efforts
to satisfy the judgment in the RICO Action (the “Judgment”), Plaintiffs
obtained a writ of execution and filed an abstract of judgment with the Los
Angeles County Recorder’s Office.  Plaintiffs recorded their Abstract of Judgment
with the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office on May 24, 2024.  Wagner Decl., ¶5, Ex. C.
Defendant Amer Group LLC is a Delaware limited
liability company.  Wagner Decl., ¶6, Ex.
D. Amer Group LLC was originally formed as a Delaware corporation named “Amer
Group Inc.” in 2011 and converted to Amer Group LLC on or about May 18, 2018.  Id.
Defendants Amer Group Inc (without a period after Inc) and
Worldtsing LLC are Texas
entities whose right to do
business was revoked by the Texas Secretary of State on or about February 23,
2024.  Wagner Decl., ¶¶ 7-8, Exs. E-F.
The organizer and sole director identified in the Certificates of Formation for
Amer Group Inc and Worldtsing LLC is “mike butler,” an alias used by Zhou in
documents obtained by Plaintiffs in the RICO Action. Id.
On April 11, 2024, just days after the RICO Judgment was
entered, Defendants filed the False Deed with the Los Angeles County Recorder’s
Office.  Wagner Decl., ¶9, Ex. G. The
False Deed purports to transfer the Property from Amer Group Inc (the Texas company) to Worldtsing. Ex.  G. 
The False Deed contains multiple pieces of false
information.  First, it falsely purports
to transfer the Property that Amer Group Inc never has owned.  In January 2011, the Property was transferred
from S & A Freshman Family Properties, LLC to “Amer Group Inc.”, the
Delaware corporation which later converted to Amer Group LLC.  Wagner Decl., ¶10, Ex. H. During the 13 years
between that purchase and the time that Plaintiffs recorded their Abstract of Judgment,
no transfer of the Property from Amer Group LLC or its Delaware predecessor
Amer Group Inc. was ever recorded. 
Wagner Decl., ¶11.
Second, the False Deed also falsely states that it is a
“Reconveyance upon satisfaction of a debt” under Section 11911 of the
California Revenue and Taxation Code. 
Wagner Decl., Ex. G. That language falsely suggests that the document
was used merely to release a security interest in the Property held by Amer
Group Inc that Worldtsing had somehow previously conveyed.  In reality, Worldtsing never owned the
Property, and never conveyed the Property to Amer Group Inc as a security
interest such that the latter could reconvey it to Worldtsing. There are no
recorded filings of any such ownership or such transactions.  Wagner Decl., ¶11.
Third, the Acknowledgement of the notary public included
with the False Deed, which
purports to notarize the identity of
the signatory, is an apparent photocopy of an identical notarial Acknowledgment
that was included with a completely different property filing in a different
county.  Wagner Decl., ¶12, Ex. I.
 
D. Analysis
Plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction to enjoin Defendants
from transferring, selling, or otherwise encumbering title to the Property.  Defendant Amer Group LLC filed an opposition
to the TRO but has not filed an opposition to the OSC.
 
1. Probability of Success
Plaintiffs argue that Defendants attempted to manufacture
this property transfer in order to place Amer Group LLC’s assets out of the reach
of Plaintiffs as judgment creditors.  On
September 24, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the instant action seeking to cancel the
False Deed on the ground that it is a fraud and forgery pursuant to Civil Code section
3412, and a fraudulent conveyance pursuant to Civil Code section 3439.04.  Mem. at 7.
As judgment lien holders to the Property and judgment
creditors of Amer Group LLC, Plaintiffs are entitled commence an action to cancel
the False Deed recorded by Defendant Worldtsing LLC.  The False Deed falsely purports to transfer
property that the supposed grantor, Amer Group Inc, did not own, it purports to
be a “Reconveyance upon satisfaction of a debt” despite the fact that there are
no recorded filings of any such ownership or such transactions, and the
Acknowledgement of the notary public included with the False Deed is a
photocopy of an identical notarial Acknowledgment that was included with a
completely different property filing in a different county.  It is well-settled that “a forged document is
void ab
initio and
constitutes a nullity.” Wutzke
v. Bill Reid Painting Service Inc.,
(1984) 151 Cal. App. 3d 36, 43.  Because
the False Deed contains numerous fraudulent representations and a forged
signature, it is void and should be cancelled under Civil Code section 3412. Mem.
at 7.
The False Deed is also plainly a fraudulent conveyance that
should be cancelled under Civil Code section 3439.04. Defendant Worldtsing
intentionally recorded the False on April 11, 2024. Filed just days after
judgment was entered in the RICO Action, and purporting to effect a transfer
between two shell companies owned by the same ultimate owner, the False Deed
was recorded with an intent to hinder, delay, and defraud Plaintiffs. Mem. at
7.
Defendant Amer Group LLC did not substantively oppose the TRO
issuance, arguing only procedural issues of inadequate service (Opp. at 3-4) and
that Defendants needed more time to retain counsel (Opp. at 7).  The court overruled these objections.
Plaintiffs have made a prima facie case that
Defendant Amer Group LLC has not rebutted. 
The court also has reviewed the two notary Acknowledgements and agrees
that the Acknowledgment on the False Deed appears to be a cut and paste.  Plaintiffs have shown a probability of
success.
 
2. Balancing of Harms
Plaintiffs argue that, without injunctive relief, nothing
prevents Defendants from attempting to illicitly transfer interest in the
Property to some new shell company or a third party, causing Plaintiffs
non-compensable economic harm.   The
consequences of such a transfer are also potentially irreversible.  A subsequent third party that is a bona fide
purchaser for value may in some cases take title free and clear of any adverse
claim based on a prior deed’s being voidable, provided that the prior deed has yet
to be declared void.  See Schiavon v. Aranudo
Brothers,
(2000) 84 Cal. App. 4th 374, 376.  If
Defendants transfer the property to an unsuspecting buyer, Plaintiffs might be
without any recourse to execute their valid judgment.  Mem. at 6.
Further, while financial harm is generally compensable in
damages, “insolvency or the inability to otherwise pay money damages is a
classic type of irreparable harm.”  See California Retail
Portfolio Fund GMBH & Co. KG v. Hopkins Real Estate Grp., (2011) 193 Cal. App. 4th 849, 857; see also Friedman v. Friedman, (1993) 20 Cal. App. 4th 876, 890 (monetary loss
constitutes irreparable harm where “there is some showing that one against whom
injunctive relief is sought is insolvent or otherwise unable to respond in
damages”).  Absent an injunction, Plaintiffs
have no chance of securing their judgment of $14,656,205.91 against Amer Group
LLC, which has no other known assets.  Mem.
at 6.
Defendant Amer Group LLC argued at the TRO hearing that no
reasonable third party would attempt to acquire the Property where an abstract
of judgment was recorded against it.  Opp.
at 5-6.  This may be true, but Defendants
would not be prevented from performing a fraudulent transfer to a related
entity without injunctive relief.   The balancing of harms weighs in Plaintiffs’
favor.
 
E. Conclusion
The application for a preliminary injunction is
granted.  Defendants Amer Group LLC, Amer
Group Inc and Worldtsing are enjoined from transferring, selling, or otherwise
encumbering title to the Property.
Plaintiffs argue that no bond should be required, but a bond
is mandatory.  The purpose of a bond is
to cover the defendant’s damages from an improvidently issued injunction.  CCP §529(a). 
In setting the bond, the court must assume that the preliminary injunction
was wrongly issued.  Abba Rubber Co.
v. Seaquist, (“Abba”) (1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1, 15.  The attorney’s fees necessary to successfully
procure a final decision dissolving the injunction also are damages that should
be included in setting the bond.  Id.
at 15-16.  While Abba reasoned
that the plaintiff’s likelihood of prevailing is irrelevant to setting the
bond, a more recent case disagreed, stating that the greater the likelihood of
the plaintiff prevailing, the less likely the preliminary injunction will have
been wrongly issued, and that is a relevant factor for setting the bond.  Oiye v. Fox, (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th
1036, 1062.  
Given the lack of opposition, a modest bond of $5000 will be
required.  The bond shall be cash or a
corporate bond, posted within seven calendar days, and Plaintiffs shall provide
evidence of its posting to opposing counsel.
