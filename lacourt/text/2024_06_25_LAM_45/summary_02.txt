```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion to compel arbitration filed by defendant Colenso Evelyn and has denied the motion. The motion was based on a Memorandum of Agreement with an arbitration clause, but the court finds that Evelyn has not met his burden of showing that the agreement is binding on plaintiff Brandon Blake in his individual capacity. The court also finds that even if the agreement were binding, the tort claims in Blake's complaint would be outside the scope of the agreement. Additionally, the court declines to compel arbitration based on California Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.2(c), which allows the court to decline to order arbitration if there is a possibility of conflicting rulings on common issues.
