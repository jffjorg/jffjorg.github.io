And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling addresses five motions: (1) motion to seal good faith settlement determination, (2) motion for determination of good faith settlement, (3) motion to seal minors' compromise petition, (4) petition to confirm minor's compromise re: Brayden Lee Wickstrom, and (5) petition to confirm minor's compromise re: Logan Thomas Wickstrom.

The Court grants the motions for good faith settlement determination and to seal, finding that the settlement was made in good faith and that confidentiality is necessary to protect the parties' privacy rights. The Court also grants the motions to seal the unredacted versions of the petitions for minors' compromise.

The Court continues the petitions to confirm minors' compromise to allow Plaintiffs to submit the necessary information, including the total settlement amount and amounts to be paid from the settlement proceeds, including attorney fees. The Court cannot determine the reasonableness of the compromise without this information.
