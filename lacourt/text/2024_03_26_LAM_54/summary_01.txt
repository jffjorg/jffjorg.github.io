And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied the defendants' motion for new trial, relief from judgment, or to vacate the judgment and enter a new judgment. The defendants argued that the plaintiff's counsel had a conflict of interest in negotiating attorney's fees, but the Court found that there was no evidence that the negotiations impacted the attorneys' fees ultimately awarded by the Court, or that the plaintiffs were prejudiced.

The defendants also argued that the motion for new trial was timely filed, but the Court found that it was filed late. The Court held that the defendants failed to comply with the jurisdictional requirements for filing a motion for new trial, and therefore, the motion was denied.

The Court also rejected the defendants' argument that the plaintiff's counsel had a conflict of interest in negotiating attorney's fees, citing the case of Ramirez v. Sturdevant, which held that bifurcated settlement negotiations can be appropriate where the client's interests are not adversely affected. The Court found that the plaintiff's counsel had properly advised the plaintiffs to independently decide whether to accept their respective offers, and that the statutory fee awards were considered the property of the attorney who earned them.
