  Case Number:  20STCP04222    Hearing Date:   October 28, 2024    Dept:  74 STEPHEN LINETT vs BRIEN BLAKELY 20STCP04222
Because Petitioner cites no authority beyond the court’s “inherent
power” in support of Petitioner’s assertion that Code of Civil Procedure section
187 “applies equally to the issue of amending a judgment to include future damages”
which had not accrued when the court entered judgment in 2021 confirming the
arbitration award, the court denies without prejudice a motion relying on
section 187 and the court’s inherent power.
Petitioner shall give notice.
