Defendant
Jacobe Enterprises, Inc. (Jacobe) moves for summary judgment on the entire
complaint, and alternatively, summary adjudication on the entire complaint, and
the claim for punitive damages. Jacobe moves on multiple grounds, including:
Lack of evidence establishing exposure, causation, and any malice, oppression,
or fraud; and affirmative evidence establishing non-exposure. Plaintiffs in
opposition challenge the motion on grounds that Jacobe fails to shift the
burden of proof, due to the lack of sufficient competent evidence, and contends
they provide affirmative evidence of exposure, causation, and corporate
knowledge. 
 
The pleadings frame the issues for motions, “since it is those
allegations to which the motion must respond. (Citation.)” (Scolinos v. Kolts (1995) 37 Cal. App.
4th 635, 640-641; FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima
(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 382-383; Jordan-Lyon
Prods., LTD. v. Cineplex Odeon Corp. (1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1459, 1472.)
The purpose of a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication “is to
provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order
to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to
resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atl.
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) 
“Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), requires the
trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all
inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other
inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material
fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of
law.”  (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110,
1119.)  
 
“On a motion for summary judgment, the initial burden is
always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no
triable issues of material fact.” (Scalf
v. D.B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) A defendant
moving for summary judgment “has met his or her burden of showing that a cause
of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the
cause of action . . . cannot be established.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) “Once the defendant . . . has
met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a
triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or
a defense thereto.” (Ibid.) 
 
A defendant may alternatively move for summary judgment on
grounds that Plaintiff lacks
sufficient evidence, and cannot reasonably obtain necessary evidence in support
of the claims.¿(Aguilar v. Atl.
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th at pp. 854-855; Collin
v. CalPortland Co. (2014)
228 Cal.App.4th 582, 587; Andrews v. Foster Wheeler LLC (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 96, 101; Union Bank v. Superior Court (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 573, 590.) The
court adheres to this standard for product liability cases, such as asbestos
and crystalline silica (e.g. latent exposure leading to mesothelioma or
silicosis).
 
“When deciding whether to grant summary judgment, the court
must consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers (except evidence to
which the court has sustained an objection), as well as all reasonable
inference that may be drawn form that evidence, in the light most favorable to
the party opposing summary judgment.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159
Cal.App.4th 463, 467; see also Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).) “An
issue of fact can only be created by a conflict in the evidence.  It is not created by speculation, conjecture,
imagination or guesswork.”  (Lyons v. Security Pacific National Bank
(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1001, 1041 (citation omitted).)
 
Jacobe relies on denial of any supply, manufacture, or
distribution of silica containing products utilized by Decedent while employed as
a fabricator. The position relies on a challenge to Plaintiffs’ evidence, and evidence
that Decedent likely worked with a product from a different
manufacturer/distributor that went by the same name. 
 
The court finds the subject matter analogous to
asbestos litigation on the basis of latent injury caused by a dangerous
product, and therefore applies the substantial factor standard in the subject
action. (Lineaweaver v. Plant Insulation Company
(1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1409, 1415, 1419.) “In the context of a cause of action
for asbestos-related latent injuries, the plaintiff must first establish some
threshold exposure to the
defendant's defective asbestos-containing products, and must further establish in reasonable medical probability
that a particular exposure or series of exposures was a “legal cause” of his
injury, i.e., a substantial factor in bringing
about the injury. In an asbestos-related cancer case, the plaintiff need not prove that fibers from the defendant's product were the
ones, or among the ones, that actually began the process of malignant cellular
growth. Instead, the plaintiff may meet the burden of proving that exposure to
defendant's product was a substantial factor causing the illness by showing
that in reasonable medical probability it contributed to the plaintiff or
decedent's risk of developing
cancer.” Rutherford v. Owens-Illinois,
Inc. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 953, 982. “[W]e conclude that the proper
analysis is to ask whether the plaintiff has proven exposure to a defendant's
product, of whatever duration, so that exposure is a possible factor in causing
the disease and then to evaluate whether the exposure was a substantial
factor.”  (Lineaweaver v. Plant Insulation Company, supra, 31
Cal.App.4th at p. 1416.)  Exposure by a
contributing party, among many, is sufficient to establish triable issues of
material fact.  The calculation of the
probabilities of whether even limited exposure constituted a substantial factor
is more appropriately addressed before the trial court.  (Id.
at pp. 1417-1419.)
 
“In the
context of a cause of action for asbestos-related latent injuries, the
plaintiff must first establish some threshold exposure to the
defendant's defective [] products, and must further
establish in reasonable medical probability that a particular exposure or
series of exposures was a ‘legal cause’ of his injury, i.e., a substantial
factor in bringing about the injury. In a[] [silicosis] case, the
plaintiff need not prove that [particulate]
from the defendant's product were the ones, or among the ones, that actually
began the process of malignant cellular growth. Instead, the plaintiff may meet
the burden of proving that exposure to defendant's product was a substantial
factor causing the illness by showing that in reasonable medical probability it
contributed to the plaintiff or decedent's risk of developing
[silicosis].” (Rutherford v. Owens-Illinois,
Inc. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 953, 982.)
 
Other than citation to discovery responses regarding the
basis of the complaint, the court finds no substantive basis for the challenge
to the insufficiency of evidence by Plaintiffs regarding the placement of Jacobe
manufactured and/or distributed silica containing artificial stone products on
the premises of any and all of Decedent’s employers during the relevant
exposure period. [See Declaration of Joshua W. Praw, Exhs. O-P.] While Jacobe
addresses the responses to requests for production with some specificity, it
does not address the responses to special interrogatories in the same manner. The
conclusive argument and reliance on denial of sufficient evidence fails to
shift the burden. (See McGonnell v. Kaiser Gypsum Co., Inc. (2002)
98 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1103-1104; Scheiding v. Dinwiddie Const. Co. (1999)
69 Cal.App.4th 64, 81.) Further, Jacobe admits there is evidence provided by
testimony of Decedent’s co-workers regarding the presence of Jacobe products in
the workplace. 
 
As to Jacobe’s argument that Decedent likely worked with a
product from a different manufacturer/distributor that went by the same name,
it presents the declaration of its Manager, Elizabeth Torres. Torres states
that Jacobe uses the fictitious name Marble Express, and Marble Express is
owned by Mr. Jack Shemtov in Anaheim. Mr. Shemtov’s father also owns a separate
company that goes by Marble Express. Torres also provides that there is no
record of sale to Decedent’s places of work in its internal records. [Declaration
of Joshua W. Praw: Declaration of Elizabeth Torres (Exh. K.).] The court finds
a lack of foundation as to Torres’ personal knowledge of Mr. Shemtov’s father’s
business, and an overall lack of support for Jacobe’s deflective argument. 
 
The court alternatively finds triable issues of material
fact based on the presence of Jacobe dba “Marble Express” products on the
premises of Decedent’s place of employment during the relevant time period. Both
Jacobe and Plaintiffs present testimony identifying Jacobe (Marble Express) products
for Bernadino’s shop. [Declaration of Joshua W. Praw: Deposition of Cesar
Quiroz, 890-891.] There is also evidence the exposure to said silica containing
stone products caused exposure and led to the silicosis diagnosis and death.
[Declaration of Kenneth Rosenman.]
 
As to Jacobe’s lack of privity argument regarding the breach
of implied warranty claim, a worker who is injured in the course of his work by
a defective product purchased by his hirer is in privity with both the
manufacturer and the supplier of the product. (Peterson v. Lamb Lumber Co.
(1960) 54 Cal.2d 339, 347-348.) Jacobe fails to sufficiently address the legal
standard.
 
Therefore, the motion for summary judgment and summary
adjudication reliant on the absence of sufficient exposure, causation, and
privity is therefore DENIED. 
 
On Fraudulent Concealment, Jacobe relies on the same
arguments and evidence addressed previously and concludes that this cause of
action fails because it is completely dependent upon the success of Plaintiffs’
underlying claims. As discussed in the prior part of the order, the court finds the evidence and argument presented by
Jacobe to be insufficient. The court therefore denies the motion for summary
adjudication on both the failure to shift the burden and triable issues of
material fact regarding failure to warn on allegedly known hazards caused by
fabrication of products containing silica. [Declaration of Brian P. Barrow,
Exh. 1.] (Jones v. ConocoPhillips Co. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 1187, 1198-1200.)
 
On punitive damages, Jacobe relies on Plaintiffs’ lack of evidence
and again on its arguments of non-exposure to its product. 
 
On punitive damages, Civil
Code section 3294, subdivision (c) authorizes punitive damages upon a showing
of malice, oppression, or fraud, which are defined as follows:
 
(1) “Malice” means
conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or
despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and
conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.
(2) “Oppression”
means despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in
conscious disregard of that person’s rights.
(3) “Fraud” means an
intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact known
to the defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby
depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.
 
“‘[M]alice does not require actual
intent to harm. [Citation.] Conscious disregard for the safety of another may
be sufficient where the defendant is aware of the probable dangerous
consequences of his or her conduct and he or she willfully fails to avoid such
consequences. [Citation.] Malice may be proved either expressly through direct
evidence or by implication through indirect evidence from which the jury draws
inferences.’ [Citations.]”  (Pfeifer
v. John Crane, Inc. (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 1270, 1299.) 
 
Consistent with the prior part of the order, the
court finds that Jacobe presents insufficient evidence in support of its
contentions, only generally points to an absence of evidence without much
address, and relies on its arguments regarding the previous causes of action
which fail as discussed previously. The motion for summary adjudication is
therefore denied in its entirety based on failure to shift the burden. 
 
In summary, the court denies the motion for summary judgement
and summary adjudication.

OF ACTIONWendy
Viridinia Solano-Castro, et al. alleges the wrongful death of Raul Garcia-Leon
caused from as a stone fabricator and installer. Plaintiffs contend working
with “toxic” stone products led to the development of silicosis and death of
Garcia-Leon on February 16, 2023. On
May 22, 2023, Plaintiff filed a 582 paragraph complaint for negligence, strict
liability – warning defect, strict liability – design defect, fraudulent
concealment, and breach of implied warranties. On May 31, 2023, Plaintiff a 235
page first amended complaint for negligence, strict liability – warning defect,
strict liability – design defect, fraudulent concealment, and breach of implied
warranties. The action names a multitude of parties comprised of suppliers,
sellers, etc. The case was deemed non-complex on June 5, 2023, and assigned to
Department 68 on June 7, 2023.  On
October 11, 2023, the court sustained the demurrer to the first amended
complaint brought by MS International, Inc. to the fourth cause of action with
20 days leave to amend. On October 18, 2023, the court overruled the demurrer
to the fourth cause of action brought by M S International, Inc. On November 2,
2023, Caesarstone USA, Inc. filed a cross-complaint for indemnity, declaratory

the age of Rebecca Garcia at the time of the filing of the motion. RULING: Denied.Request
for Judicial Notice of OSHA Regulations, et al.: Granted. Defendant
Dal-Tile Distribution, LLC (DTDLLC) moves for summary adjudication on the
fourth cause of action for fraudulent concealment, and the claim for punitive
damages. DTDLLC, an admitted importer and distributor of artificial stone products,
including Co-Defendant Dal-Tile, LLC ceramic tile and the One Quartz brand
manufactured by third party Dal-Tile Tennessee, LLC, moves on grounds that Plaintiffs
lack evidence in support of the cause of action and punitive damages claim.  Plaintiffs
in opposition challenge the motion on grounds that DTDLLC fails to establish a
lack of sufficient evidence required to shift the burden of proof for summary
judgment. Plaintiffs also allege liability on grounds of a failure to disclose
silica hazards in compliance with the “Hazard Communication Standard”
established in OSHA regulations.  The
court electronic filing system shows no reply on file at the time of the
tentative publication cutoff. The court reserves the right to take any matters
under submission for purposes of addressing timely filed replies and
evidentiary objections, if applicable. The pleadings frame the issues for motions, “since it is those
allegations to which the motion must respond. (Citation.)”  (Scolinos
v. Kolts (1995) 37 Cal. App. 4th 635, 640-641; FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 382-383; Jordan-Lyon Prods., LTD. v. Cineplex Odeon Corp. (1994) 29
Cal.App.4th 1459, 1472.) The purpose of a motion for summary judgment or
summary adjudication “is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’
pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in
fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar
v. Atl. Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.)  “Code of Civil Procedure section 437c,
subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the
evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’
and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to

Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)   “On a motion for summary judgment, the initial burden is
always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no
triable issues of material fact.” (Scalf

moving for summary judgment “has met his or her burden of showing that a cause

(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) “Once the defendant . . . has

triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or

grounds that Plaintiff lacks

of the claims.¿(Aguilar v. Atl.
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th at pp. 854-855; Collin
v. CalPortland Co. (2014)
228 Cal.App.4th 582, 587; Andrews v. Foster Wheeler LLC (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 96, 101 [41 Cal.Rptr.3d 229, 234]
855Union Bank v. Superior Court (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 573, 590.) The
court adheres to this standard for product liability cases, such as asbestos
and crystalline silica (e.g. latent exposure leading to mesothelioma or
silicosis). “When deciding whether to grant summary judgment, the court
must consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers (except evidence to
which the court has sustained an objection), as well as all reasonable

imagination or guesswork.”  (Lyons v. Security Pacific National Bank
(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1001, 1041 (citation omitted).) DTDLLC relies on the declaration of Roy Viana, Director of
Product. Viana represents DTDLLC operates as a subsidiary under Dal-Tile Group,
Inc., which itself is a subsidiary of Mohawk Industries, Inc. Viana admits to
the distribution of manufactured stone products exclusively under the One
Quartz brand. [Declaration of Roy Viana.] DTDLLC follows up with copies of the
discovery responses, including lack of identification of DTDLLC in the fourth
cause of action within the operative complaint. [Declaration of Angela Sayre, Index
of Exhibits, Ex. 1-9.] Plaintiffs specifically take issue with the conclusive
nature of the inadequate discovery position, including specific reference to
DTDLLC via incorporation of the prior causes of action as to the fourth cause
of action. [See Sayre Decl., Index of Exhibits, Ex. 1: Amended Complaint, ¶
482.] As for the discovery responses, Plaintiffs provide dozens of pages of
single space factually specific reference to the basis of the claim on grounds
of both knowledge of the hazards of silica exposure and potential release of
the incorporated silica from fabrication work performed by workers such as
Decedent. Plaintiffs specifically and indisputably reference the One Quartz
Collection and attendant safety sheet requirements to which DTDLLC makes no
mention.  [Id., Ex. 3, 5: Responses to
Special Interrogatories.] The court considers the allegations in context of the
fraudulent concealment cause of action. DTDLLC challenges the lack of any basis
of duty to disclose any specific potential harms from the product. “[T]he
elements of a cause of action for fraud based on concealment are: ‘(1) the
defendant must have concealed or suppressed a material fact, (2) the defendant
must have been under a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3) the
defendant must have intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the
intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have been unaware of
the fact and would not have acted as he did if he had known of the concealed or
suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of the concealment or suppression of the
fact, the plaintiff must have sustained damage. [Citation.]’” (Kaldenbach v.
Mutual of Omaha Life Ins. Co. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 830, 850 (internal
quotation marks omitted.)  “There are ‘four
circumstances in which nondisclosure or concealment may constitute actionable
fraud: (1) when the defendant is in a fiduciary relationship with the
plaintiff; (2) when the defendant had exclusive knowledge of material facts not
known to the plaintiff; (3) when the defendant actively conceals a material
fact from the plaintiff; and (4) when the defendant makes partial
representations but also suppresses some material facts. [Citation.]’” (LiMandri v. Judkins (1997) 52
Cal.App.4th 326, 336.) “Each of the other three circumstances in which
nondisclosure may be actionable presupposes the existence of some other
relationship between the plaintiff and defendant in which a duty to disclose
can arise. … As a matter of common sense, such a relationship can only come
into being as a result of some sort of transaction between the parties.” (Id. at pp. 336–337.)  Plaintiffs counter with authority the court finds
on point. “The requirement's purpose is to inform consumers
about a product's hazards and faults of which they are unaware, so that they
can refrain from using the product altogether or evade the danger by careful
use.” (Jones v. ConocoPhillips Co. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 1187, 1198.)
Users include persons responsible for processing materials not privy to
information regarding necessary safety protocols. The withholding of said
information subjects a defendant to potential fraudulent concealment liability.
(Id. at pp. 1199-1200.) The court finds DTDLLC insufficiently addresses
the claims regarding both a legal lack of ability to present the claim and lack
of sufficient evidence. DTDLLC also lacks sufficient address of the warning
requirements for a known harmful product. [Declaration of Raphael Metzger, Ex.
A-E.] (McGonnell v. Kaiser Gypsum Co., Inc. (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1103-1104; Scheiding v. Dinwiddie Const. Co. (1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 64, 81.) The court therefore DENIES
the motion for summary adjudication on the fraudulent concealment cause of
action. On punitive damages, DTDLLC challenges the sufficiency against the
corporate entity. Plaintiff again lacks substantive address and instead relies
on the integrated challenges.  On punitive damages, Civil
Code section 3294, subdivision (c) authorizes punitive damages upon a showing
of malice, oppression, or fraud, which are defined as follows: (1) “Malice” means
conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or
despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and
conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.(2) “Oppression”
means despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in
conscious disregard of that person’s rights.(3) “Fraud” means an
intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact known
to the defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby
depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury. “‘[M]alice does not require actual
intent to harm. [Citation.] Conscious disregard for the safety of another may
be sufficient where the defendant is aware of the probable dangerous
consequences of his or her conduct and he or she willfully fails to avoid such
consequences. [Citation.] Malice may be proved either expressly through direct
evidence or by implication through indirect evidence from which the jury draws
inferences.’ [Citations.]”  (Pfeifer
v. John Crane, Inc. (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 1270, 1299.)  Consistent with the
prior part of the order, the court again finds the motion insufficiently
addresses the evidence presented by Plaintiff regarding the knowing
distribution of the silica containing product, including corporate knowledge
and direction for the manufacture and distribution of an allegedly harmful
product. [Sayre Decl., Index of Exhibits, Ex. 3, 5: Responses to Special
Interrogatories.] (White v. Ultramar,
Inc. (1999) 21 Cal.4th 563, 576–577; Cruz v. HomeBase (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 160, 168.) The motion for
summary adjudication on punitive damaegs is therefore DENIED. In summary, the court denies the motion for summary
adjudication. DTDLLC to give notice to all parties.  Dept.

the age of Rebecca Garcia at the time of the filing of the motion.
 
RULING: Denied.
Request
for Judicial Notice: Granted.
 
Defendant
Euro Stone America International, Inc. (Euro Stone) moves for summary judgment
on the entire complaint on grounds of lack of evidence establishing causation
due to the lack of evidence establishing the placement of a Euro Stone product
in the presence of Decedent. Plaintiffs in opposition challenge the motion on
grounds that Euro Stone fails to shift the burden of proof, due to the lack of
sufficient competent evidence, and triable issues placing Euro Stone product in
proximity to Decedent. Euro Stone in reply maintains the liability claim lacks
any competent evidence. Euro Stone represents a typographical error in the Declaration
of Ivan Gonzalez, and offers to produce a revised declaration. Euro Stone also
challenges the admissibility of evidence, though submits no objections with the
December 31, 2024, filed reply. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1354.)
 
The pleadings frame the issues for motions, “since it is those
allegations to which the motion must respond. (Citation.)” (Scolinos v. Kolts (1995) 37 Cal. App.
4th 635, 640-641; FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima
(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 382-383; Jordan-Lyon
Prods., LTD. v. Cineplex Odeon Corp. (1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1459, 1472.)
The purpose of a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication “is to
provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order
to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to
resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atl.
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) 
“Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), requires the
trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all
inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other
inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material
fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of
law.”  (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110,
1119.)  
 
“On a motion for summary judgment, the initial burden is
always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no
triable issues of material fact.” (Scalf
v. D.B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) A defendant
moving for summary judgment “has met his or her burden of showing that a cause
of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the
cause of action . . . cannot be established.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) “Once the defendant . . . has
met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a
triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or
a defense thereto.” (Ibid.) 
 
A defendant may alternatively move for summary judgment on
grounds that Plaintiff lacks
sufficient evidence, and cannot reasonably obtain necessary evidence in support
of the claims.¿(Aguilar v. Atl.
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th at pp. 854-855; Collin
v. CalPortland Co. (2014)
228 Cal.App.4th 582, 587; Andrews v. Foster Wheeler LLC (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 96, 101; Union Bank v. Superior Court (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 573, 590.) The
court adheres to this standard for product liability cases, such as asbestos
and crystalline silica (e.g. latent exposure leading to mesothelioma or
silicosis).
 
“When deciding whether to grant summary judgment, the court
must consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers (except evidence to
which the court has sustained an objection), as well as all reasonable
inference that may be drawn form that evidence, in the light most favorable to
the party opposing summary judgment.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159
Cal.App.4th 463, 467; see also Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).) “An
issue of fact can only be created by a conflict in the evidence.  It is not created by speculation, conjecture,
imagination or guesswork.”  (Lyons v. Security Pacific National Bank
(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1001, 1041 (citation omitted).)
 
The court finds the subject matter analogous to
asbestos litigation on the basis of latent injury caused by a dangerous
product, and therefore applies the substantial factor standard in the subject
action. (Lineaweaver v. Plant Insulation
Company (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1409, 1415, 1419.) “In the context of a cause
of action for asbestos-related latent injuries, the plaintiff must first
establish some threshold exposure to the
defendant's defective asbestos-containing products, and must further establish in reasonable medical probability
that a particular exposure or series of exposures was a “legal cause” of his
injury, i.e., a substantial factor in bringing
about the injury. In an asbestos-related cancer case, the plaintiff need not prove that fibers from the defendant's product were the
ones, or among the ones, that actually began the process of malignant cellular
growth. Instead, the plaintiff may meet the burden of proving that exposure to
defendant's product was a substantial factor causing the illness by showing
that in reasonable medical probability it contributed to the plaintiff or
decedent's risk of developing
cancer.” Rutherford v. Owens-Illinois,
Inc. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 953, 982. “[W]e conclude that the proper
analysis is to ask whether the plaintiff has proven exposure to a defendant's
product, of whatever duration, so that exposure is a possible factor in causing
the disease and then to evaluate whether the exposure was a substantial
factor.”  (Lineaweaver v. Plant Insulation Company, supra, 31
Cal.App.4th at p. 1416.)  Exposure by a
contributing party, among many, is sufficient to establish triable issues of
material fact.  The calculation of the
probabilities of whether even limited exposure constituted a substantial factor
is more appropriately addressed before the trial court.  (Id.
at pp. 1417-1419.)
 
“In the
context of a cause of action for [silica]-related latent injuries, the
plaintiff must first establish some threshold exposure to the
defendant's defective [] products, and must further
establish in reasonable medical probability that a particular exposure or
series of exposures was a ‘legal cause’ of his injury, i.e., a substantial
factor in bringing about the injury. In a[] [silicosis] case, the
plaintiff need not prove that [particulate]
from the defendant's product were the ones, or among the ones, that actually
began the process of malignant cellular growth. Instead, the plaintiff may meet
the burden of proving that exposure to defendant's product was a substantial
factor causing the illness by showing that in reasonable medical probability it
contributed to the plaintiff or decedent's risk of developing
[silicosis].” (Rutherford v. Owens-Illinois,
Inc. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 953, 982.)
 
Euro Stone relies on denial of any supply,
manufacture or distribution of silica containing products utilized by Decedent,
while employed as a fabricator. The position relies on a challenge to both
Plaintiffs’ evidence, and a denial of any record(s) placing products in the
proximity of Decedent. Euro Stone maintains Plaintiffs are unable to
specifically “pinpoint” the location(s) of exposure, and company records show
no delivery of products to GTO Stone (Decedent’s place of employment from 2007
through 2014) or to Bernadino Sanchez (2015-2022). [Declaration of Ivan
Gonzalez; Declaration of Marc Shapiro, Compendium of Exhibits, Ex. A-D.]
 
Plaintiff raises a valid challenge to the evidence in
that Ivan Gonzalez represents Euro Stone American International, LLC, rather
than named defendant Euro Stone America, Inc. the actual answering entity. The
court accepts the challenge of Plaintiff in that the motion and declaration of
Rodriguez lacks address of the actual entity named in the subject action. Plaintiff
also references Euro Stone supplying other co-defendants, thereby potentially
placing products in the vicinity of Decedent. This position lacks any
supporting evidence, and it otherwise remains unclear whether Plaintiffs are
embracing this position for purposes of opposing the motion. Regardless, the
court finds the evidentiary challenge of the Rodriguez declaration precludes a
finding of insufficient evidence. (See McGonnell
v. Kaiser Gypsum Co., Inc. (2002) 98
Cal.App.4th 1098, 1103-1104; Scheiding v. Dinwiddie Const.
Co. (1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 64, 81.) The court declines to invite
an amended declaration in that Plaintiffs will be deprived of an opportunity to
timely object and respond given the shortened deadlines necessitated by the
preference order.
 
Even
if the Rodriguez declaration were considered, however, and the court finds
Plaintiff somewhat concedes to the lack of specific evidence of direct sales
records, Plaintiffs specifically present evidence of Euro Stone product(s) in
the presence of Decedent. [Declaration of Scott Brust, Ex. 9: Deposition of
Cesar Quiroz, 963:23-96-973:15.] Euro Stone offers challenges to the expert
declaration of Ronseman and the deposition testimony, but the court electronic
filing system shows no filed objections. The court otherwise declines to find
any inadmissible evidence. The expert witness properly relies on the deposition
testimony of percipient regarding the presence of silica containing products on
the premises and in proximity of Decedent, and form a direct opinion as to
causation of silicosis as a result of exposure. The standard as to causation
for latent injury silicosis harm cited above therefore supports a finding of
triable issues of material fact as to the presence of silica from artificial
stone supplied
by Euro Stone. [Declaration of Kenneth Rosenman.] 
 
The motion for summary judgment is therefore DENIED.

OF ACTIONWendy
Viridinia Solano-Castro, et al. alleges the wrongful death of Raul Garcia-Leon
caused from as a stone fabricator and installer. Plaintiffs contend working
with “toxic” stone products led to the development of silicosis and death of
Garcia-Leon on February 16, 2023. On
May 22, 2023, Plaintiff filed a 582 paragraph complaint for negligence, strict
liability – warning defect, strict liability – design defect, fraudulent
concealment, and breach of implied warranties. On May 31, 2023, Plaintiff a 235
page first amended complaint for negligence, strict liability – warning defect,
strict liability – design defect, fraudulent concealment, and breach of implied
warranties. The action names a multitude of parties comprised of suppliers,
sellers, etc. The case was deemed non-complex on June 5, 2023, and assigned to
Department 68 on June 7, 2023.  On
October 11, 2023, the court sustained the demurrer to the first amended
complaint brought by MS International, Inc. to the fourth cause of action with
20 days leave to amend. On October 18, 2023, the court overruled the demurrer
to the fourth cause of action brought by M S International, Inc. On November 2,
2023, Caesarstone USA, Inc. filed a cross-complaint for indemnity, declaratory
relief and apportionment. On December 29, 2023, Lowes Home Centers, LLC filed a
cross-complaint indemnity, declaratory relief and apportionment. On
September 5, 2024, the court granted the motion for trial preference based on
the age of Rebecca Garcia at the time of the filing of the motion. RULING: Denied.Request
for Judicial Notice of OSHA Regulations, et al.: Granted. Defendant
Dal-Tile, LLC (DTLLC) moves for summary judgment on the entire complaint, and
alternatively, summary adjudication on the fourth cause of action for
fraudulent concealment, and the claim for punitive damages. DTLLC, an admitted
manufacturer of products, moves on grounds that it only operates as an
independent parent company of certain subsidiary entities, including
co-defendant Dal-Tile Distribution, LLC and third party Dal-Tile of Tennessee,
LLC, and denies any direct operational control thereby subjecting it to
liability. DTLLC also contends Plaintiffs lack evidence in support of the motion,
and deny the existence of any direct evidence establishing the manufacture of
the product that allegedly caused silica exposure to Decedent. DTLLC represents
it only manufacturers ceramic tile, and Dal-Tile of Tennessee was the only
entity responsible for manufacturing silica containing artificial stone under
the “One Quartz” trade name during the relevant exposure period.  Plaintiffs
in opposition challenge the motion on grounds that the denial of any
manufacture of silica containing products contradicts its own safety sheets and
prior sworn testimony in a prior action. Plaintiff maintains the DTLLC safety
sheets identify DTLLC, and predecessor entity, Dal Tile Corporation, as the
manufacture of One Quartz stone. Plaintiffs additionally rely on extensive
challenge to the PMQ declaration regarding contradictory testimony presented in
a prior action. Plaintiffs conclude with discussion regarding the failure to
shift the burden of proof based on the lack of sufficient evidence to prevail. The
court electronic filing system shows no reply on file at the time of the
tentative publication cutoff. The court reserves the right to take any matters
under submission for purposes of addressing timely filed replies and
evidentiary objections, if applicable. The pleadings frame the issues for motions, “since it is those
allegations to which the motion must respond. (Citation.)”  (Scolinos
v. Kolts (1995) 37 Cal. App. 4th 635, 640-641; FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 382-383; Jordan-Lyon Prods., LTD. v. Cineplex Odeon Corp. (1994) 29
Cal.App.4th 1459, 1472.) The purpose of a motion for summary judgment or
summary adjudication “is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the
parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations,
trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atl. Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.)  “Code of Civil Procedure section 437c,
subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the
evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’
and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.”  (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)   “On a motion for summary judgment, the initial burden is
always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no
triable issues of material fact.” (Scalf
v. D.B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) A defendant
moving for summary judgment “has met his or her burden of showing that a cause
of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the
cause of action . . . cannot be established.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) “Once the defendant . . . has
met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a
triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or
a defense thereto.” (Ibid.)  A defendant may alternatively move for summary judgment on
grounds that Plaintiff lacks
sufficient evidence, and cannot reasonably obtain necessary evidence in support
of the claims.¿(Aguilar v. Atl.
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th at pp. 854-855; Collin
v. CalPortland Co. (2014)
228 Cal.App.4th 582, 587; Andrews v. Foster Wheeler LLC (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 96, 101 [41 Cal.Rptr.3d 229, 234]
855Union Bank v. Superior Court (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 573, 590.) The
court adheres to this standard for product liability cases, such as asbestos
and crystalline silica (e.g. latent exposure leading to mesothelioma or
silicosis). “When deciding whether to grant summary judgment, the court
must consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers (except evidence to
which the court has sustained an objection), as well as all reasonable
inference that may be drawn form that evidence, in the light most favorable to
the party opposing summary judgment.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159
Cal.App.4th 463, 467; see also Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).) “An
issue of fact can only be created by a conflict in the evidence.  It is not created by speculation, conjecture,
imagination or guesswork.”  (Lyons v. Security Pacific National Bank
(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1001, 1041 (citation omitted).) DTLLC relies on the declaration of Roy Viana, Director of
Product. Viana represents DTLLC operates as a subsidiary under Dal-Tile Group,
Inc., which itself is a subsidiary of Mohawk Industries, Inc. DTLLC also
identifies as a parent company to unidentified subsidiaries “not relevant to
the matters in dispute.” Notwithstanding purported independent operation,
“DTLLC, as a parent corporation, provides operational guidance, direction and
consistency relating to many aspects of these separate businesses, including,
but not limited to, plant industrial hygiene and the creation and distribution
of relevant Safety Data Sheets as these apply to the products made, sourced
and/or sold by other corporations.” Viana otherwise denies any “day to day” management.
Viana maintains DTLLC only manufacturers ceramic products, and other silica
containing artificial stone products identified as One Quartz are/were made by
Dal-Tile of Tennessee, LLC. Co-Defendant Dal-Tile Distribution, Inc. distributes
all Quartz brand manufactured stone slabs. [Declaration of Roy Viana.]  Parent-Subsidiary analysis arises under agency principles. “We start with the firm proposition that neither ownership
nor control of a subsidiary corporation by a foreign parent corporation,
without more, subjects the parent to the jurisdiction of the state where the
subsidiary does business. (Citations.) ‘Control’ in this context means the degree of direction
and oversight normal and expected from the status of ownership; it comprehends such common characteristics as
interlocking directors and officers, consolidated reporting, and shared
professional services. ...  “However,
the case law identifies one situation when the acts of the parent may be found
to trespass the boundaries of legitimate ownership and control of the
subsidiary and expose the parent to the power of the state in which the
subsidiary does business. Thus, where the nature and extent of the control
exercised over the subsidiary by the parent is so pervasive and continual that
the subsidiary may be considered nothing more than an agent or instrumentality
of the parent, notwithstanding the maintenance of separate corporate
formalities, jurisdiction over the parent may be grounded in the acts of the
subsidiary/agent. (Citation.) In this instance, the question is not whether there
exists justification to disregard the subsidiary's corporate identity, the
point of the alter ego analysis, but instead whether the degree of control
exerted over the subsidiary by the parent is enough to reasonably deem the
subsidiary an agent of the parent under traditional agency principles. ...  “Control
is the key characteristic of the agent/principal relationship. ... [¶] The
nature of the control exercised by the parent over the subsidiary necessary to
put the subsidiary in an agency relationship with the parent must be over and
above that to be expected as an incident of the parent's ownership of the
subsidiary and must reflect the parent's purposeful disregard of the
subsidiary's independent corporate existence. ...” Sonora Diamond Corp. v. Superior Court (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 523, 540–542.) The declaration of Viana admits to the manufacture of stone
products by Dal-Tile Tennessee with sales made by Dal-Tile Distribution, LLC,
including the One Quartz brand. Viana otherwise denies responsibility for daily
management, but admits to establishing certain operational standards and
responsibility for issuing safety sheets.  Plaintiffs specifically take issue with the conclusive
nature of the inadequate discovery position. The operative complaint
specifically alleges work with Dal-Tile products caused and/or contributing to
the fatal silicosis diagnosis. The cited responses in fact identify Dal-Tile
personnel, including officers, directors and Persons Most Knowledgeable, which
can very well include Viana based on represented testimony and declarations
provided in prior action against Dal-Tile. [Declaration of Angela Sayre, Ex. 1-9,
Index of Exhibits.] While the court declines to consider the alleged prior
testimony, the court concludes insufficient address of the discovery presented
in the subject action. DTLLC cites terse portions of the responses from the
otherwise highly detailed and specific pages and pages of single spaced factual
responses extensively describing the basis of the claims. Plaintiffs also
specifically address the corporate history of Dal-Tile, knowledge of the
hazards, and basis of misrepresentation as to the safety of the product(s).
Plaintiffs identify the data sheets for One Quartz product in particular, and
names numerous potential witnesses, medical records, as well as categories of
Dal-Tile employees and officers. The simple dismissal of the extensive factual responses
insufficiently establishes a lack of necessary evidence to establish liability
under the standard. Furthermore, the other “ceramic tiles” are not specifically
identified, but DTLCC admits to the manufacture of ceramic products with silica
in them. Said products are not specifically identified as Quartz One. It
remains unclear whether these other products are part of the product inventory
leading to exposure. Regardless, the court finds a complete lack of address of
other silica containing manufactured products and the potential existence as a
basis for denial of the motion for summary judgment on this basis Plaintiff additionally presents specific evidence
identifying DTLLC and predecessor entity, Dal-Tile Corporation as the
manufacturer of the Quartz One product, as well as other ceramic products with
silica warnings, according to the safety sheets. [Declaration of Raphael
Metzger, Ex. F-J.] At a minimum, the identification of DTLLC as the
manufacturer of Quartz One, regardless of any subsequent denial by Viana
constitutes triable issues of material fact as to the manufacture of silica
containing products leading to the silicosis diagnosis of Decedent. (See Gray v. Reeves (1977) 76
Cal.App.3d 567, 573-574; see also D'Amico
v. Board of Medical Examiners (1974) 11
Cal.3d 1, 21-22.) In addition to DTLLC being identified in discovery responses,
coworker and percipient witness, Cesar Quiroz, also establishes the presence of
the product(s) in proximity to Decedent for purposes of establishing triable
issues of material fact. [Brust Decl., Ex. 2 & 5: Deposition of Cesar
Quiroz, 142:6-13, 453:12-466:12.] Said proximity of artificial silica
containing DTLLC slabs constitutes sufficient evidence of causation for
purposes of establishing triable issues of material fact on causation. [Declaration
of Kenneth Rosenman.] The motion for summary judgment is therefore DENIED. On Fraudulent Concealment, DTLLC challenges the lack of any
basis of duty to disclose any specific potential harms from the product(s).
Plaintiffs present no specific opposition other than the general reliance on
the failure to shift the burden, challenge to the Barney declaration, and
marketing positions.  “[T]he
elements of a cause of action for fraud based on concealment are: ‘(1) the
defendant must have concealed or suppressed a material fact, (2) the defendant
must have been under a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3) the
defendant must have intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the
intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have been unaware of
the fact and would not have acted as he did if he had known of the concealed or
suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of the concealment or suppression of the
fact, the plaintiff must have sustained damage. [Citation.]’” (Kaldenbach v.
Mutual of Omaha Life Ins. Co. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 830, 850 (internal
quotation marks omitted.)  “There are ‘four
circumstances in which nondisclosure or concealment may constitute actionable
fraud: (1) when the defendant is in a fiduciary relationship with the
plaintiff; (2) when the defendant had exclusive knowledge of material facts not
known to the plaintiff; (3) when the defendant actively conceals a material
fact from the plaintiff; and (4) when the defendant makes partial
representations but also suppresses some material facts. [Citation.]’” (LiMandri v. Judkins (1997) 52
Cal.App.4th 326, 336.) “Each of the other three circumstances in which
nondisclosure may be actionable presupposes the existence of some other
relationship between the plaintiff and defendant in which a duty to disclose
can arise. … As a matter of common sense, such a relationship can only come
into being as a result of some sort of transaction between the parties.” (Id. at pp. 336–337.)  Again, Plaintiffs provide no substantive legal
address, but the court notes the standard for certain types of product
potentially applicable, and considered in a demurrer on the subject cause of
action brought by a different co-defendant. “The requirement's purpose is to inform consumers about a
product's hazards and faults of which they are unaware, so that they can
refrain from using the product altogether or evade the danger by careful use.”
(Jones v. ConocoPhillips Co. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 1187, 1198.) Users
include persons responsible for processing materials not privy to information
regarding necessary safety protocols. The withholding of said information
subjects a defendant to potential fraudulent concealment liability. (Id. at pp.
1199-1200.) The operative complaint present allegations
regarding knowledge of the allegedly toxic substance, crystalline silica,
dangers to workers engaged in the cutting, grinding, fabrication, polishing,
etc. with the product, and failure to disclose potential toxicity upon working
with said products. Decedent was specifically exposed and harmed as a result of
the non-disclosed hazards and continued work with the supplied product. The
allegations meet the standard for fraudulent concealment. (Bockrath v. Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc.
(1999) 21 Cal.4th 71, 78-79.) Under the consideration for product liability summary judgment,
the court finds insufficient address of this standard for purposes of shifting
the burden. The court therefore denies the motion for summary adjudication on
both the failure to shift the burden and triable issues of material regarding
failure to warn on allegedly known hazards caused by fabrication of products
containing silica. [Index of Exhibits, Responses to Specially Drafted
Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents; Metzger Decl., Ex.
E-I.] On punitive damages, DTLLC challenges the sufficiency against the
corporate entity. Plaintiff again lacks substantive address and instead relies
on the integrated challenges.  On punitive damages, Civil
Code section 3294, subdivision (c) authorizes punitive damages upon a showing
of malice, oppression, or fraud, which are defined as follows: (1) “Malice” means
conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or
despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and
conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.(2) “Oppression”
means despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in
conscious disregard of that person’s rights.(3) “Fraud” means an
intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact known
to the defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby
depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury. “‘[M]alice does not require actual
intent to harm. [Citation.] Conscious disregard for the safety of another may
be sufficient where the defendant is aware of the probable dangerous
consequences of his or her conduct and he or she willfully fails to avoid such
consequences. [Citation.] Malice may be proved either expressly through direct
evidence or by implication through indirect evidence from which the jury draws
inferences.’ [Citations.]”  (Pfeifer
v. John Crane, Inc. (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 1270, 1299.)  Consistent with the prior part of the order, the
court again finds the motion insufficiently addresses the evidence presented by
Plaintiff regarding the knowing distribution of the silica containing product,
including corporate knowledge and direction for the manufacture and
distribution of an allegedly harmful product. The court additionally finds
triable issues of material fact on the basis of knowledge, ratification, and
malice. [Index of Exhibits, Responses to Specially Drafted Interrogatories
and Requests for Production of Documents; Metzger Decl., Ex. E-I.] (White v. Ultramar, Inc. (1999)
21 Cal.4th 563, 576–577; Cruz
v. HomeBase (2000)
83 Cal.App.4th 160, 168.) The motion for summary adjudication is therefore
denied in its entirety.  In summary, the court denies the motion for summary judgment
and summary adjudication. DTLLC to give notice to all parties.
