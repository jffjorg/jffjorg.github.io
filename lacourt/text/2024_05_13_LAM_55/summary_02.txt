And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication on the first and second causes of action. The plaintiff seeks to establish that the defendant made false statements to cause other tenants not to pay rent and prospective tenants to decline rentals, and that the defendant is at least $94,065.00 behind in past due rent. The plaintiff argues that the undisputed facts establish each element of the defamation and intentional interference with prospective economic advantage claims. However, the plaintiff failed to provide evidence regarding the amount of claimed damages in his separate statement. The judge finds that the plaintiff did not establish the elements of his claim, thereby precluding summary judgment or adjudication. The judge also notes that the defendant's opposing separate statement is not in the required format and that the defendant's evidence is not authenticated by any shown personal knowledge of the defendant.
