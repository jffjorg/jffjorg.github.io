 Case Number:  23STCV20476    Hearing Date:   May 13, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  Motion of Plaintiff for Summary Judgment or, in
the Alternative, Summary Adjudication.
BACKGROUND
JOHN OURSLAND (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against
self-represented litigant JOE SHERMAN (“Defendant”), alleging that Defendant is
one of Plaintiff’s tenants renting one of the apartments that has been owned by
Plaintiff and his deceased ex-spouse, and who is at least $94,065.00 behind in
past due rent, and he has been making false statements to cause other tenants
not to pay rent and prospective tenants to decline rentals. The causes of
action are: 1) Defamation; 2) Intentional Interference with Prospective
Economic Advantage; and 3) Civil Harassment. Plaintiff has since dismissed the
civil harassment claim.
Plaintiff requests summary judgment, or summary
adjudication as to the First and Second Causes of Action. Defendant opposes the
motion. 
LEGAL STANDARD
In moving for summary judgment or summary
adjudication, a “plaintiff . . . has met his or her burden of showing that
there is no defense to a cause of action if that party has proved each element
of the cause of action.”  Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 437c(p)(1). Plaintiffs may shift the burden of proof to the opposition by
submitting evidence as to every element of the cause of action. WRI
Opportunity Loans II, LLC v. Cooper (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 525, 532. A
motion for summary judgment must be denied where the moving party's evidence
does not prove all material facts. E.g., Salesguevara v.  Wyeth Labs., Inc.  (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 379, 384, 387.  All necessary evidence must be referenced in
the moving party's separate statement to be considered. Scripps Clinic v.
Superior Court (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 917, 928. “The court may properly
disregard evidence not cited in the parties’ separate statements when it ‘is
not referenced, is hidden in voluminous papers, and is not called to the
attention of the court at all.’” Food Safety Net Services v. Eco Safe
Systems USA, Inc. (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 1118, 1134.
Once a moving party has satisfied the initial burden
of proof, the burden “shifts to the opposing party to show, by responsive
separate statement and admissible evidence, that triable issues of fact exist.”
Ostayan v. Serrano Reconveyance Co. (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1411, 1418, disapproved
on other grounds by Black Sky Cap., LLC v. Cobb (2019) 7 Cal.5th 156,
165; see also Code Civ. Proc., § 437c(p)(1). “A party may not raise a triable
issue of fact at summary judgment by relying on evidence that will not be
admissible at trial.” Perry v. Bakewell Hawthorne, LLC (2017) 2 Cal.5th
536, 543.
EVIDENTIARY OBJECTION
The Court sustains Plaintiff’s evidentiary objections to
the declaration of Joseph W. Sherman.
ANALYSIS
Plaintiff argues that he is entitled to summary judgment
or adjudication of his First and Second Causes of Action because the undisputed
facts establish each of the elements of both the defamation and intentional
interference with prospective economic advantage claims. 
The elements of a defamation claim are: (1) Defendant
made a statement about Plaintiff that is (a) defamatory, (b) false, (c)
unprivileged, and (2) damages suffered because of Defendant’s wrongful conduct.
Taus v. Loftus (2007) 40 Cal. 4th 683, 720; see also Judicial Council of
California Civil Jury Instruction 1702. Defamation damages may include a decline
of business. E.g., Total Call Internat. Inc. v. Peerless Ins. Co. (2010)
181 Cal.App.4th 161, 169. Also, defamation may include emotional distress within
the total amount of damages. Flynn v. Higham (1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 677,
681. 
The elements of a claim for intentional interference
with prospective economic advantage are: “(1) a relationship between the
plaintiff and some third party with the probability of future economic benefit
to the plaintiff; (2) the defendant’s knowledge of the relationship; (3) a
wrongful act, apart from the interference itself, by the defendant designed to
disrupt the relationship; (4) actual disruption of the relationship; and (5)
economic harm to the plaintiff proximately caused by the acts of the
defendant.” Salma v. Capon (2008) 161 Cal. App. 4th 1275, 1290; see also see
also Judicial Council of California Civil Jury Instruction 2202.
A plaintiff cannot obtain summary adjudication while
leaving the amount of damages to be determined later. Paramount Petroleum
Corp. v. Superior Court (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 226, 241. An issue of
damages must dispose of an entire cause of action. DeCastro West Chodorow
& Burns, Inc.  v.  Superior Court (1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 410,
422. That way, when a court grants summary judgment it can enter a judgment in
the plaintiff’s favor for an amount certain, which the plaintiff can then seek
to enforce. But here, Plaintiff failed to state any amount of claimed damages
in the Separate Statement. Plaintiff’s Separate Statement regarding the First
Cause of Action includes that Plaintiff has been significantly damaged
including “suffering from mental anguish, embarrassment, and loss of reputation”
and has also lost income in an undetermined amount. Sep. Stmt. Nos. 10-11. As
to the Second Cause of Action, Plaintiff’s Separate Statement states that
prospective tenants did not rent apartments because of Defendant’s defamatory
statements and Plaintiff has lost income, but Plaintiff provides no actual
amount of claimed damages. Id., Nos. 18-19. Plaintiff’s failure to
provide evidence regarding the amount of damages – and to include such evidence
in his Separate Statement- means he has not established these elements of his
claim, precluding summary judgment or adjudication. See Paramount Petroleum,
227 Cal.App.4th at 243 (“a plaintiff cannot obtain judgment on a [claim] in an
amount of damages to be determined later”).  
Because the burden did not shift to Defendant, the
Court need not address whether Defendant satisfied his burden. However, the
Court notes that Defendant’s opposing evidentiary objections and separate
statement are not in the required formats, which prevents sound rulings. 
Procedurally, an opposing separate statement “must
unequivocally state whether that fact is ‘disputed’ or ‘undisputed’”, and, as
to disputes, must “state, on the right side of the page directly opposite the
fact in dispute, the nature of the dispute and describe the evidence that
supports the position that the fact is controverted.” Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1350(f). Further, “[t]hat evidence must be supported by citation to exhibit,
title, page, and line numbers in the evidence submitted.”  Ibid.
Evidentiary objections failing to quote the evidence
objected to, in violation of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1354, should be
overruled. Nazir v. United Airlines, Inc. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 243,
255-56 (“Over 250 of the sustained objections failed to quote the evidence
objected to, in violation of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1354.”). “The
rules requiring evidentiary objections to be filed separately and not repeated
in the separate statement are to allow the trial court to consider each piece of
evidence and all of the objections applicable to that piece of evidence
separately.”  Hodjat v. State Farm
Mutual Automobile Ins. Co. (2012) 211 Cal. App. 4th 1, 9 (court had
discretion not to rule on evidentiary objections in separate statement).
Defendant’s voluminous exhibits are not authenticated
by any shown personal knowledge of Defendant. Thus, the Court finds
insufficient evidence that Defendant did not make some statements or that the others
were true. The truth defense to defamation claims is established where evidence
proves that the imputation is substantially true, so as to justify the gist or
sting of the remark, irrespective of slight inaccuracies in the details. Summit
Bank v. Rogers (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 669, 697.
 
For example, Defendant’s extensive testimony in a
deposition in the probate matter about a trust, is not shown to be admissible. There
is a general rule against using depositions in subsequent cases, unless the
proponent shows the requirements of Evidence Code section 1291(a)(2) are
satisfied.  Berroteran v. Superior
Court (2022) 12 Cal.5th 867, 904. Additionally, as for Defendant’s own
discovery responses, they are inadmissible. Parties may use interrogatory
responses only against responding parties, and responding parties may not use
their own interrogatory responses in their favor. Great American Ins. Cos.
v. Gordon Trucking, Inc. (2008) 165 Cal. App. 4th 445, 450. Further,
Defendant’s showing Plaintiff’s discovery responses containing only objections
are not supportive of triable issues of material fact. The prescribed procedure
is for a party to request a continuance of a motion for summary judgment, to
obtain discovery responses, and to show: 1) Facts to be obtained are essential
for opposing; 2) reason exists for believing that such facts may exist; and 3)
reasons why the time is needed. Lerma v. County of Orange (2004) 120
Cal.App.4th 709, 715.
CONCLUSION
Thus, the Court denies the motion.
