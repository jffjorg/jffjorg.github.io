BACKGROUND 
 
Plaintiff, Jonathan Raiman, brought this action
on July 18, 2022 against
General Motors for violation of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act and the
Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act. 
 
Plaintiff now moves for an order awarding it fees
and costs as the prevailing party and as provided for in the Section 998 offer
accepted by plaintiff.  The parties do
not dispute that plaintiff is the prevailing party and entitled to such fees
under the Song Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (Civil Code Section 1794(d). They
dispute the reasonableness of the fees sought. 
 
[TENTATIVE]
RULING 
 
 Plaintiff’s
Motion for Attorney’s Fees is GRANTED, in a reduced amount.   
 
LEGAL STANDARD 
 
A prevailing party is entitled to reasonable
attorney fees in addition to other costs.  (CCP § 1033.5(a)(10).) 
“Prevailing party” includes the party with a net monetary recovery, a defendant
in whose favor a dismissal is entered, a defendant where neither plaintiff nor
defendant obtains any relief, and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who
do not recover any relief against that defendant.  (CCP §
1032(a)(4).)  In all other circumstances, the “prevailing party” shall be
as determined by the court.  (Id.) 
 
The fee setting inquiry ordinarily begins with
the “lodestar,” i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the
reasonable hourly rate.  (PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22
Cal. 4th 1084, 1095.)  “The lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on
consideration of facts specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the
fair market value for the legal services provided.”  (Gorman v.
Tassajara Dev. Corp. (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 770, 774.) 
 
In determining whether to adjust the lodestar
figure, the court may consider the nature and difficulty of the litigation, the
amount of money involved, the skill required and employed to handle the case,
the attention given, the success or failure, and other circumstances in the
case.  (EnPalm LLC v. Teitler (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 770,
774.) The prevailing party bears the burden of proof and the amount is
left to the trial court’s sound discretion.  (Christian Research
Institute v. Alnor (2008) 165 Cal. App. 4th 1315, 1320.)  A fee
request that appears unreasonably inflated is a special circumstance permitting
the trial court to reduce the award or deny one altogether.  (Serrano
v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 635.) 
 
In challenging attorney fees as excessive
because too many hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the
challenging party to point to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient
argument and citations to the evidence.¿ (Premier Medical Management
Systems, Inc. v. California Ins. Guaranty Assoc. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th
550, 564.)¿ General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or
unrelated do not suffice.¿ (Ibid.)¿ 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
Attorney’s Fees 
 
Plaintiff here seeks attorney fees of $26,071.40
(which includes a multiplier of .22), costs of $777.68, and an additional $6899.44
in fees and costs incurred in filing the instant motion.   In the instant case, defendant made an offer
to compromise on October 23, 2023, which was accepted by plaintiff on November
15, 2023.   There were no motions filed in
the case or other activity before this court, other than a short IDC held on
May 10, 2023.   The only pleadings filed
by the Plaintiff were the complaint, a case management statement, a proof of service
and a notice of Posting Jury Fees.  The
IDC statement filed by plaintiff was two pages long.  There was no opposition filed to the IDC
statement and the only issue discussed at the brief IDC related to the
scheduling of the PMK deposition, which was never taken.  The only discovery in the case was boilerplate
written discovery propounded by plaintiff and defendant. The only other
activity involved emails and other communications between counsel about
obtaining extensions to respond to discovery and scheduling the single PMK
deposition. No deposition was ever taken. 
Plaintiff never responded to the discovery propounded on it by
defendant.  Defendants issued an initial Section
998 offer on May 5, 2023.  Plaintiff did
not respond to it or accept it. 
Plaintiff accepted the same offer to compromise for $80,500 on November
15, 2023.  The only difference between
the two offers was that the second one included prejudgment interest.  
 
Civil Code section 1794(d) provides that a prevailing
plaintiff in a case brought under the Song Beverly Act shall recover “a sum equal
to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees based
on actual time expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably
incurred . . . in connection with the commencement and prosecution” of this
action. (Civ. Code §1794(d); see Graham v. Daimler Chrysler Corp. (2004)
34 Cal.4th 553, 557.)   “Even after determining that a party is
entitled to fees because it ‘prevailed,’ the trial court must still determine
what amount of fees would be ‘reasonable’ in light of the relative extent or
degree of the party's success in obtaining the results sought.” (Sokolow v.
County of San Mateo (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 231, 247.) Serrano v. Priest (Serrano III)
(1977) 20 Cal.3d 25 defined the lodestar-adjustment method for determining the
amount of reasonable attorney fees in California, and the California Court of
Appeal has held the lodestar method applies to determining attorney's fees
under the Song-Beverly Act. (Robertson v. Fleetwood Travel Trailers of
California, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th, 785, 817; Graciano v. Robinson
Ford Sales (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154).  
 
Hourly Rate 
 
In determining the reasonable hourly rate, the
court looks to whether the requested rates are “within the range of reasonable
rates charged by and judicially awarded comparable attorneys for comparable
work.” (Children's Hosp. & Med. Ctr. v. Bontá (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 740,
783.) “Generally, the reasonable hourly rate used for the lodestar calculation
is that prevailing in the community for similar work.” (Center for Biological
Diversity v. County of San Bernardino (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 603, 616.)
 
Attorney Kaloustian billed his time at $600 per
hour; Daniel Imber at $600 per hour, Judith Chamussy at $350 per hour and paralegals
at $150 per hour. The court finds all of these rates reasonable given the
current market rates for similar counsel, and the education, experience and
specialized qualification of these particular attorneys.  
 
Reasonableness of Time Spent 
 
Despite
this being a simple case that settled with little work being performed by
either side, plaintiff had two law firms working on the case.   The court has reviewed the billing records
submitted and finds that there was some duplication of effort by attorneys
Kalustian and Imber (two highly experienced consumer attorneys with years of
experience litigating lemon law cases), and some unnecessary work after the
final Section 998 offer was received, rendering some of the time spent
excessive and unreasonable.   The court
finds the following hours to have been unreasonably incurred.
 
7/18/23 – 1 hour by Imber to review complaint which
the Kalustian firm had already drafted and filed ($600).
 
8/29/23 – 1 hour by Imber to review answer,
duplicating review by Kalustian firm ($600).
 
10/23/23 -- .1 hours by Kaloustian (billing at
$600) per hour to make a reservation for the fee motion – this should have been
done by a paralegal at a far lower billing rate ($60.)
 
12/7/23 – .4 hours by Imber to review discovery
responses by Imber when Kalustian also reviewed the same records ($240).
 
Time spent between the receipt of the second Section
998 offer and its acceptance, as plaintiff’s counsel appears to have engaged in
“make work” during this period rather than simply accepting the offer.  The court notes that counsel’s own records
show the Imber office received the 998 offer on 10/23 but did not communicate
with the client about it until 10/30.  Although
they presumably had the plaintiff’s authorization as of 10/30 (since there were
no subsequent communications with plaintiff after that date and prior to the
acceptance), Imber’s office did not prepare the acceptance until November 15,
2023.  Nonetheless, the Kaloustian firm
was still engaging in busy work with respect to discovery that they would have
known would never be provided. Specifically, the court finds the following work
by the Kaloustian office to be unreasonable:
 
11/1/23 – Preparation of discovery responses for 2.5
hours by Chamussy ($875).
 
11/1/23 Draft objections to plaintiff’s deposition
for .3 hours by staff ($45)
 
11/21/23 – Review of Objections to Plaintiff’s
NOD by Kalustian for .1 hours ($60)
 
 
With respect to the request for $6899.44 in fees
for bringing this simple motion for attorneys fees, most of which is
boilerplate language, the court finds the fee request to be excessive. The
court finds the reasonable amount of time to prepare the motion and to appear
at the hearing to be as follows: 2.5 hours of staff time by the Kaloustian firm
($375) to prepare the motion; 1 hour by Kaloustian ($600) for preparation of
his declaration and preparation of the motion;  and 1 hour by Chamussy ($350) for her
preparation of the motion and declaration. No reply brief was filed.  Attorney Imber also reasonably spent an hour at
$600 to prepare his declaration and review the motion which was drafted by the
Kaloustian firm ($600).  In addition, the
court finds an appearance by lead counsel Kaloustian at the hearing ($600) also
to be reasonable, for a total charge of $2525. 

 
Multiplier
 
The court agrees with defendant that a “multiplier”
is unjustified in this case. Counsel for plaintiff claims a multiplier is
warranted because of the “contingent risk,” the delay in payment and because
defendant refused to resolve the issue of fees. 
None of these factors are present in this case, nor present to such a
degree as to warrant a multiplier.  This
case did not require any extraordinary legal skill – it was an ordinary lemon
law case which presented no novel issue, was handled by attorneys whose value
was already reflected in their high hourly charges, resulted in no motion
practice, never got past the earliest stages of discovery and was resolved within
13 months of the defendant answering. 
Plaintiff extended the life of the case only over the issue of whether
it would receive prejudgment interest, ironically incentivizing delay on the
part of plaintiff to resolve the case.  Little
was gained by the refusal to accept the first Section 998 demand, which would
have cut short the case by more than six months.  Under the circumstances, the court finds
plaintiff has not justified the need for a multiplier in this case.  (See Robertson v. Fleetwood Travel Trailers
of California, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 785, 819). 
 
Therefore, Plaintiff is entitled to recover
attorney’s fees in this action in the amount of $18890 on the underlying
litigation, plus $2525 on the fee motion, or a total of $21,415.  
 
 
 
Costs 
 
Plaintiff is also entitled to recover reasonable
costs for this action.  There does not
seem to be a serious dispute as to plaintiff’s entitlement to recover their
entire requested costs, or $789.90.
 
CONCLUSION &
ORDER
 
For the foregoing reasons, the court awards Plaintiff
$21,415 in attorney’s fees and $789.90 in costs. Plaintiff is ordered to
prepare and serve a notice of ruling and proposed final judgment in accordance
with California Rule of Court 3.1312 within 10 days.
