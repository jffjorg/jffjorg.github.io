And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents, set one, in part. The plaintiff sought documents related to Transmission Defects in other 2019 Kia Niro vehicles, which are relevant to the issues related to Kia's good faith compliance with the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The defendant opposed the motion, arguing that the plaintiff did not sufficiently meet and confer, and that the discovery requests were disproportionate to the claims at issue. The court found that the plaintiff demonstrated good cause for the documents sought and granted the motion in part, limiting the scope of discovery to vehicles purchased or leased in California of the same year, make, and model of the subject vehicle, for the period of the date of purchase to the present. The court also denied the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,160.00, finding that there was substantial justification for the defendant's actions.
