And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for sanctions in part and has awarded $11,517.50 in sanctions. The defendant had argued that the plaintiff had misused the discovery process by serving many subpoenas on the defendant's clients before initiating discovery with the defendant. The court found that this constituted an abuse of the discovery process. The defendant had requested $14,346.50 in sanctions, but the court found that a lower award was more appropriate. The court awarded $11,571.50 in sanctions, which includes 38.6 hours of research and drafting time at $250 per hour and 6.3 hours of meeting and conferring time at $305 per hour.
