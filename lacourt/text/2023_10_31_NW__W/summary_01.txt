And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, American Honda Motor Co., Inc., has filed a motion to compel arbitration and stay the action in a lemon law case brought by the plaintiff, Bryan Guino. The plaintiff leased a 2020 Honda Accord and alleges that the vehicle had a sensing defect that the defendant knew about and concealed. The defendant argues that the parties have an arbitration agreement that requires them to resolve their disputes through arbitration rather than litigation. The court agrees that the parties do have an arbitration agreement, but finds that the defendant has waived its right to compel arbitration due to its unreasonable delay in filing the motion. The court also finds that the defendant's delay was not justified by any bad faith or wilful misconduct. As a result, the court denies the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay the action.
