English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies Plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment without prejudice. The Plaintiff had previously submitted a default judgment package, which was denied without prejudice on October 16, 2023. The Plaintiff has not explained whether the 10% prejudgment interest rate calculation complies with Nebraska law, which is the governing law of the underlying contract at issue. The Judge recommends that the Plaintiff submit a proposed order accepting a copy of the original loan agreement in lieu of the original. The Plaintiff can resubmit the default judgment package with the additional documents prior to the next hearing, and the Judge will review it again.
