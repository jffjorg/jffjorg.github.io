Amur Equipment Finance, Inc.’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment 
Defendant: Daniel Ferrer Hernandez, an Individual dba DFH Services 
TENTATIVE RULING
DENIED without prejudice. 
BACKGROUND
This is a collection action. On May 17, 2023, Plaintiff Amur
Equipment Finance, Inc. (Plaintiff) filed this action against Defendant Daniel
Ferrer Hernandez, an Individual dba DFH Services (Defendant) and Does 1 through
100, alleging causes of action for breach of written agreement, open book
account, and account stated. Default was entered against Defendant on September
5, 2023. Plaintiff previously submitted a default judgment package on September
8, 2023, which was denied without prejudice on October 16, 2023. Plaintiff
submitted a default judgment package again on October 20, 2023.
LEGAL
STANDARD
Code of Civil Procedure section 585
permits entry of a default judgment after a party has failed to timely respond
or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party seeking judgment on the default by
the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of
the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the
judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of
costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a dismissal of
all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate
judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds
for each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’
fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1800.)  
ANALYSIS
Plaintiff seeks default judgment against
Defendants in the total amount of $46,929.32, including $42,816.64 in damages, $3,601.28
in interest, $0.00 in attorney’s fees, and $511.40 in costs. The Court finds that
while Plaintiff has addressed a number of issues noted in the Court’s October
16, 2023 order, Plaintiff still has not explained whether the 10% prejudgment
interest rate calculation complies with Nebraska law, which is the governing
law of the underlying contract at issue. (See Order Re: Tentative Ruling
(10/16/23).). Plaintiff should also submit a proposed order accepting a copy of
the original loan agreement in lieu of
the original. 
CONCLUSIONBased on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice. Plaintiff can submit the additional documents discussed herein prior to the next hearing and the Court will review the default judgment package again. If the default judgment is then entered prior to the 12/13/23 OSC hearing, no appearance will be required and the hearing will go off-calendar.
