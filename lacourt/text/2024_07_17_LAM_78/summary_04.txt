The Court also finds that the forum selection clause in the loan agreement between Plaintiff and Woodside does not apply to the underlying lawsuit. The Court concludes that Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate by preponderance of evidence that Denali has purposefully availed itself to this forum's benefits. The Court grants the motion to quash service of summons and orders that the moving party give notice.
