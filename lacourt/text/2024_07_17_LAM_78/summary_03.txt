And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant Southern Hotel, L.P.'s motion to strike Plaintiff Danielle Lawana Williams' complaint. The motion sought to strike allegations for punitive and exemplary damages. The judge found that the Defendant failed to fulfill the meet and confer requirement prior to filing the motion to strike. The judge also disagreed with the Defendant's argument that Plaintiff failed to allege that the complained of conditions were present in her unit. The judge further ruled that the Defendant's reliance on extrinsic evidence was not permissible. The judge concluded that the Plaintiff's allegations were sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. The motion is therefore denied.
