Summary:

The tentative ruling is regarding a quiet title action stemming from a 2007 arbitration agreement. The court is inclined to ask for supplemental briefing as to the statute of limitations (SOL) issue. The defendant has filed a cross-complaint alleging that the plaintiff has not transferred his ownership interest in the property, and the plaintiff has filed a demurrer arguing that the cross-complaint is barred by the SOL. The court has overruled the demurrer as it relates to the first argument, but is considering the SOL issue and is inclined to allow for supplemental briefing.
