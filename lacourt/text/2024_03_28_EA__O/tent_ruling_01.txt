CROSS-DEFENDANT WENDY LIN’S DEMURRER TO BO SUN’S VERIFIED
FIRST AMENDED CROSS-COMPLAINT is TBD; court is inclined to ask for
supplemental briefing as to the SOL issue. 
 
Background
 
This is a
quiet title action stemming from a 2007 arbitration agreement in cases
BC330493 and BC335624. 
 
On June 14,
2022, Plaintiff Wendy Lin (“Lin” or “Plaintiff”) filed the complaint against BO
SUN, an individual (“Sun” or “Defendant”); ALL PERSONS UNKNOWN, Claiming Any
Legal or Equitable Right, Title, Estate, Lien, or Interest in the Property
Described in this Complaint Adverse to Plaintiff’s title, or any Cloud upon
Plaintiff’s Title Thereto; and DOES 1 through 20, inclusive for: 
 
1.     Breach of Fiduciary 
2.     Conversion 
3.     Fraud
4.     Quiet Title
5.     Common County—Money Lent 
 
On July 12,
2022, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Lis Pendens. 
 
On August 24,
2022, Defendant filed a Demurrer, which on October 4, 2022 the court sustained
with leave to amend. 
 
On December
5, 2022, Plaintiff filed a FAC for 1. Breach Of Fiduciary Duty 2. Quiet Title
3. Fraud 4. Declaratory Relief 5. Injunctive Relief 6. Unjust Enrichment/
Constructive Trust 7. Quantum Meruit. 
 
On January
12, 2023 Defendant filed its demurrer to the FAC, which on 2/28/23 the court
sustained with leave to amend as to the fraud and quiet title causes of action,
and overruled as to the others. 
 
On March 10,
2023, Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint (SAC). 
 
On June 14,
2023, the parties filed a stipulation for leave for Plaintiff to file a
proposed third amended complaint (TAC). That same day, Plaintiff filed a TAC,
alleging the following COAs: 1.     Breach of Fiduciary Duty 2.     Quiet Title 3.     Fraud and Concealment [the third COA
is categorized into two counts]. 4.     Declaratory Relief 5.     Injunctive Relief 6.     Unjust Enrichment/Constructive Trust
 
On August 3,
2023, Defendant filed a demurrer and motion to strike (MTS) to the TAC, which
the court (on 9/20/23) sustained in its entirety without leave to amend,
meaning that the 2nd and 3rd COAs were stricken.
According to the minute order, Defendant was given until October 20, 2023 to
file a responsive pleading.
 
On October
11, 2023, Defendant filed a motion to expunge lis pendens. 
 
On October
24, 2023, Defendant filed his answer along with a cross-complaint (CC) against
Plaintiff Wendy[1]
for: 1.     Declaratory
relief 2.     Quiet
title and 3.     Partition
 
On November 21, 2023, Plaintiff filed a demurrer to the CC,
which on 1/9/24, the court sustained with leave to amend. 
 
On January 29, 2024, Defendant filed his first amended CC. 
 
On February 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant demurrer.
 
On March 12, 2024, Defendant filed his opposition. 
 
On March 21, 2024, Plaintiff filed her reply. 
 
 
 
Discussion
 
At the outset, it appears that only the 16482 Monte
Cristo property is at issue in this CC. (See CC p. 4:7-14.) 
 
The CC alleges that Plaintiff transferred her interest in
the 16485 Monte Cristo property to Defendant and that the 12368 Valley property
sold, and Plaintiff’s share of net proceeds was directly paid to Defendant. That
leaves the 16482 Monte Cristo property at issue wherein Defendant alleges that
despite the court determining that both have a 50% ownership interest in the
property, “Plaintiff never transferred the 50% ownership interest in 16482
Monte Cristo to [Defendant]” (CC ¶14) and based thereon an actual controversy
exists as to the “legal title of 16482 Monte Cristo.” (¶16; see also 3rd
COA for partition focuses on the 16482 Monte Cristo property.) 
 
Thus, it is unclear why the demurrer references the 16485
Monte Cristo property. (See demurrer p. 4:5-6; p. 7:3-5.) Accordingly, any
arguments referencing the 16485 Monte Cristo property will be disregarded. 
 
The court now turns to the merits of the demurrer.
 
It appears that the demurrer raises three arguments:
 
1.    
Defendant did not file a petition to confirm the
arbitration award within 4 years after the award was entered (Demurrer p.
4:7-10; p. 6:25-26)[2]
2.    
The CC is barred by the statute of limitations (SOL)
because he failed to file this action more than 16 years after the 2007
arbitration judgment, and he has failed to allege any facts to demonstrate his
inability to use due diligence and to claim ownership of the 16482 Property
(Demurrer p. 6:21-27; Reply pp. 2-6.) 
3.    
The partition COA fails to state all the elements.[3]
 
1.    
Confirming Arbitration[4] 
 
To enforce an arbitral award under the CAA, a petition to
confirm must be filed no earlier than ten days after, but not later than four
years from, the date of service of a signed copy of the award on the petitioner
(Cal. Civ. Proc. Code §§ 1288, 1288.4).
 
In Opposition, Defendant maintains that as alleged in
paragraph 5 in the complaint, on April 17, 2007, a judgment confirming an
arbitration award was entered by a Los Angeles County Court in the case
entitled Lin v. Sun, et al., case number BC330493, together with a consolidated
case number BC335624. 
 
Indeed, according to Ex. 1 found in the request for judicial
notice (RJN), the arbitration award was issued on 2/23/2007 and confirmed by
the court on 4/27/2007. The Reply is silent as this argument. 
 
Therefore, the court OVERRULES the demurrer as it relates to
the first argument. 
 
2.    
SOL 
 
Plaintiff conclusively argues that the quiet title
COA is barred by the three-year SOL governing fraud or mistake. (Demurrer p. 8,
citing to Salazar v. Thomas (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 467.) 
 
While the Reply may offer an elaboration such as that
Defendant was “well aware of the ownership interest in the property in 2007 at
the time of the arbitration judgment and in 2010/2011 when the other Monte
Cristo property was sold and distributed,” raising new arguments in a reply is
impermissible. 
 
That
said, the court is somewhat persuaded that the basis of the CC may be time
barred. In fact, it appears Defendant concedes that he knows he’s
been an equitable title holder since the 2007 arbitration
judgment. For example, Defendant avers that “[t]here is no [SOL] problem here
because [Defendant] had an equitable claim on 16482 Monte Cristo dating back to
April 27, 2007” (Opp. p. 3:27-28, italics added) or that he “never had
reason to believe that he had a title problem…because it had been awarded to
him in the arbitration award” (Opp. p. 3:23-25, italics added.).[5] To
the extent that Defendant is arguing that Plaintiff has been obstructing
Defendant’s efforts from obtaining legal title from the get-go (Opp. p.
4:1-3) because Plaintiff “never placed [Defendant’s] name on the title” (Opp.
p. 3:20-21), then Defendant has, contrary to his assertion, been aware
of the problem since 2007. 
 
With
that, the court is inclined to allow for supplemental briefing as to whether
the CC is time-barred.   
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the demurrer is TBD.
