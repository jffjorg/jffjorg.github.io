And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and reply filed in this case. The majority of the demurrer is focused on the statute of limitations (SOL) issue, but the court will not address this argument as it is unclear what element the defendant has not pled. The partition COA is derivative of the quiet title COA, and the court will continue to refer to the plaintiff, Wendy, as the plaintiff. The plaintiff's own complaint is based on the same arbitration award, and it is unclear how the plaintiff can argue that a petition to confirm the arbitration award was not filed without rendering her own claims meritless. If the defendant is a title holder, then a declaratory COA appears moot. The court will consider these points and issue a final ruling at a later date.
