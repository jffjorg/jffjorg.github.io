The court has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff must revise and resubmit the complaint to address the court's concerns. The court's concerns arise from the plaintiff's failure to allege sufficient facts regarding the injury-producing event and the mother's sensory perception of it. The court has ordered the parties to meet and confer at length to resolve these issues. The court has also requested that the defendant attach copies of the meet and confer emails between the parties if a subsequent demurrer is filed.
