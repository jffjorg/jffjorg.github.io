[1] Though by the
cross-complaint the plaintiff is also deemed a cross-defendant, for clarity
purposes, the court will continue to refer to Wendy as Plaintiff. 


[2] The majority of the
demurrer is as to this issue and then the Reply pivots to focus more on the SOL
issue. 
 


[3] Plaintiff
conclusively sets forth this argument thus it is unclear what element Defendant
hasn’t pled. Therefore, the court will not address this argument. In any event,
the partition COA is derivative of the quiet title COA. 
 


[4] This argument is
also unclear in that Plaintiff’s own complaint is based upon the same
arbitration award. Thus, for Plaintiff to argue that a petition to confirm the
arbitration award was not filed would, presumably, render her own claims
meritless.  


[5] And if
Defendant is a title holder, then a declaratory COA appears moot.
