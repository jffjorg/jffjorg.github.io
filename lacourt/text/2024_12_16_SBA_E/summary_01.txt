The judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer filed by the defendant, City of Los Angeles, Los Angeles World Airports, and Does 1-25, with leave to amend. The demurrer challenges the sufficiency of the plaintiff's complaint, which alleges causes of action for negligence, premises liability, and willful failure to warn. The judge finds that the complaint fails to state a valid cause of action against the public entity defendants, citing Government Code § 815.2 and other relevant statutes. The judge grants the demurrer with leave to amend, allowing the plaintiff to revise the complaint to address the deficiencies identified in the demurrer.
