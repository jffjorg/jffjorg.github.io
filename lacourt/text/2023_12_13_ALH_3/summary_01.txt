And here is the English text summary:

This tentative ruling is in response to Plaintiff Angelina Yu's motion for reconsideration of the Sanctions Order issued on November 14, 2022. The Sanctions Order imposed sanctions against Martin Jerisat, Ying Xu, and the Law Offices of Eric K. Chen in the amount of $1,120. The Plaintiff argues that the deposition subpoena was not properly served and that the deponent's appearance made any objections moot. However, the Court finds that the motion is not based on new facts, circumstances, or law, and therefore denies the motion for reconsideration. The Court cites Code of Civil Procedure section 1008(a) and several court cases to support its decision.
