Summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants Plaintiff Oscar Armando Figueroa's motion to compel further responses to requests for production from Defendant FCA US LLC. The motion was filed because Defendant failed to respond to Plaintiff's requests for production, despite a meet-and-confer effort. The judge finds that good cause exists to support the documents sought, as they concern Defendant's knowledge of defects in the subject vehicle and potential willfulness of warranty violations.

The judge also grants Plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of Defendant's person most qualified. The motion was filed because Defendant failed to appear for examination and failed to respond to Plaintiff's request for a deposition. The judge finds that Plaintiff has shown entitlement to an order compelling Defendant's deposition, as a notice was served, Defendant objected, and Plaintiff received no response to subsequent efforts to accommodate Defendant's objections.
