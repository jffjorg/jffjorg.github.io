Counsel for  Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Krystal Enterprises LLC to give notice.   STATEMENT OF THE CASE This consolidated action arises out of alleged breach of  contract. In Case No. 22STCV29225, Plaintiff Associated Petroleum Products,  Inc. (“APP”) brings suit against Defendants Gloria Leonor Cubides, Akop  Hakopian, and Veronica Escamilla (collectively, “Defendants”) alleging the  following causes of action: 1.      Breach of Contract; 2.      On Common Counts; and 3.      Unjust Enrichment.   Plaintiff APP alleges that Defendant Cubides executed a “Confidential  Credit Application and Acknowledgement of Terms” (the “Credit Agreement”) as  well as a personal guaranty for delivery of fuel to a fuel service station  located at 1871 Colorado Blvd., Los Angeles, California 90041. Plaintiff APP alleges that Defendants breached the agreements “by failing  and refusing to pay the principal sum of $3,302,968.43.” In the Third Amended Cross-Complaint (“TACC”), Defendant  Gloria Leonor Cubides (hereafter, “Defendant Cubides” or “Cross-Complainant  Cubides”) alleges the following causes of action against Plaintiff APP: 1.      Breach of Contract; 2.      Intentional Misrepresentation; 3.      Negligent Misrepresentation; and 4.      Accounting.   Cross-Complainant Cubides alleges that APP breached the Credit Agreement  by failing to accurately bill for the fuel and the proper prices, and made  fraudulent misrepresentations concerning their ability to accurately bill for  the fuel at quoted prices in order to induce her to enter into the agreement.    On August 6, 2024, the Court consolidated Case No. 22STCV29225  and Case No. 24STCV01702.   In Case No. 24STCV01702,  Plaintiffs Krystal Enterprises LLC (“Krystal”) and Veronica Escamilla (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) bring  suit against Defendant Gloria L. Cubides dba C T Propane alleging the following cause of action: 1.       Breach  of Written Contract.   Plaintiffs allege it entered into a written Lease Agreement for the lease  of a gas station at 1871 Colorado Blvd. Los Angeles, CA that provides that  Defendant indemnify Plaintiffs “against any and all claims, judgments, causes  of action, damages,  penalties, costs,  liabilities, and expenses… incurred in the defense of any such or any action or  proceeding…  arising at any time…  in connection with (1) any default in the  performance of any obligation on Tenant's part to be performed under the terms  of this Lease, or (ii) Tenant's use of the Premises, the conduct of Tenant's  business or any activities, work or things done, permitted or suffered by  Tenant in or about the Premises or other portions of the Project, except to the  extent caused by Landlord's gross negligence or willful 10 conduct...”     Plaintiffs allege that they tendered a defense and indemnity to Defendant  Cubides against the claims asserted against her in Case No. 22STCV29225, but  that Defendant breached the Lease Agreement by refusing to acknowledge her  indemnity obligations and failing to provide Plaintiffs with a defense in Case  No. 22STCV29225.   On June 24, 2024, in Case No. 24STCV01702, Defendant/Cross-Complainant Cubides filed her verified First Amended  Cross-Complaint (the “FACC”) against Cross-Defendants Krystal  Enterprises LLC, Veronica  Escamilla, Akop Hakopian a/k/a Apy  Hakopian a/k/a Jack Hakopian, Merit Propane, Inc., Angelina Alocer, and EZ Fuel  (collectively, “Cross-Defendants”) alleging the following causes of action: 1.       Breach Of Fiduciary Duty 2.       Constructive Trust 3.       Conversion-Embezzlement 4.       Receipt Of Stolen Property (Pc § 496) 5.       Declaratory Relief 6.       Accounting 7.       Quasi-Contract - Restitution; 8.       Quiet Title; 9.       Partition By Sale; 10.   Dissolution; 11.   Equitable Contribution; and 12.   Equitable Indemnity.   In the FACC, Defendant/Cross-Complainant Cubides alleges  that she, “Escamilla and  their respective husbands, Armen and Akop Hakopian, formed a partnership that  owns and operates a collection of three gasoline service stations.”   Defendant/Cross-Complainant Cubides alleges that the partners created two  entities to act as agents of the partnership: Krystal Enterprises, LLC, which  was created as the partnership’s agent to hold title to real estate, and CT  Propane Fuel, Inc. (hereafter, “CT Propane”), which was created as the  partnership’s agent to operate the petroleum service station businesses.   The FACC alleges that “[i]n aid of the partnership, Cubides transferred  her home to Escamilla, who later transferred it to Krystal, to use as  collateral for the partnership’s needed business loans. Thereafter, the assets  were commingled.”   The FACC alleges that, following the passing of  Defendant/Cross-Complainant Cubides’s husband, Armen Hakopian, Escamilla  and Akop Hakopian “began a campaign to take for  themselves all of the equity and assets of the partnership and exclude Cubides.”  The FACC alleges that, “[w]hen Cubides discovered this, she revoked Hakopian’s  access to one of the partnership’s bank accounts,” and “[i]n retaliation,  Escamilla denied Cubides’ rights and role in the partnership altogether and now  seeks to leave Cubides solely responsible for the liabilities of the  partnership.”   Defendant/Cross-Complainant Gloria Cubides (hereafter, “Defendant  Cubides”) filed the instant Motion [To] Compel Further Response From  Krystal Enterprises, LLC To Request For Production, Set One And Request For  Sanctions (the “Motion”).   GROUNDS FOR MOTION            Pursuant to Code of Civil  Procedure section 2031.310, Defendant Cubides moves for an order compelling  further responses by Plaintiff Krystal to Defendant Cubides Request for  Production of Documents, Set One, Nos. 32 and 33, and for sanctions against  Plaintiff Krystal in the amount of $1,000.00 for reasonable attorney’s fees and  costs.                 DISCUSSION   I.                    PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS   Before bringing a motion to compel further responses to any  discovery request, the moving party is required to make efforts to meet and  confer in good faith and must submit a declaration attesting to those efforts.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(b); 2031.310(b)(2); 2033.290(b).) “A meet and  confer declaration in support of a motion shall state facts showing a  reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue  presented by the motion.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2016.040.) However, a  discovery motion need not be denied automatically based upon the reason that  the moving parties failed to meet and confer in good faith. (See Obregon  v. Sup. Ct. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424, 434.)     The notice of motion must be served within 45 days after service  of the responses in question; otherwise, the demanding party waives the right  to compel any further responses. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(c); 2031.310(c);  2033.290(c); Sperber v. Robinson (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 736, 745; see  also Code Civ. Proc., § 1013 [extending notice time if served by mail,  overnight delivery, or fax].) However, the parties can also agree in writing on  a specific later date by which to file the motion to compel. (Code Civ. Proc.,  §§ 2030.300(c); 2031.310(c); 2033.290(c).) The 45-day time limit is mandatory  and jurisdictional. (Sexton v. Sup.Ct. (Mullikin Med. Ctr.)  (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)    Any motion involving the content of a discovery request or the  responses to such a request shall also be accompanied by a separate statement  providing all information necessary to understand each discovery request and  all the responses at issue. (Cal.  R. Ct., 3.1345(a), (c); but see Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300(b)(2);  2031.310(b)(3); 2033.290(b)(2) [“In lieu of a separate statement required under  the California Rules of Court, the court may allow the moving party to submit a  concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute.”].)   Here, the Court finds that Defendant  Cubides has complied with all the requisite procedural requirements. The Motion  was filed and served on July 25, 2024, or forty-five (45) days after service of  Plaintiff Krystal’s responses to Defendant Cubides’s Request for Production of Documents,  Set One, which were served on June 10, 2024. (Fabi M. Behnam Decl., ¶ 4;  accord, Opposition, p. 2.)    The Court finds that the  declaration of Fabi M. Behnam satisfies the meet and confer requirements, (Behnam  Decl. at. ¶¶ 6-9, Ex. C), and  rejects Plaintiff Krystal’s argument that Defendant Cubides failed to  satisfy the meet and confer requirements. (See Opposition at pp. 3-4.)   II.                 MERITS   A.     Legal Standards   A motion to compel further  responses to a demand for production of documents may be brought if (1) a  statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete; (2) a representation of  inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive; and/or (3) an  objection in the response is without merit or too general. (Code Civ. Proc., §  2031.310(a).)    A representation of inability to  comply must (1) affirm a diligent search and reasonable inquiry has been made  in an effort to comply with that demand; (2) specify whether the inability to  comply is because the particular item or category has never existed, has been  destroyed, has been lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has never been, or is no  longer, in the possession, custody, or control of the responding party; and (3)  set forth the name and address of any natural person or organization known or  believed by that party to have possession, custody, or control of that item or  category of item. (Code Civ. Proc. §2031.230.)   “If only part of an item or  category of item in a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is  objectionable, the response shall contain a statement of compliance, or a  representation of inability to comply with respect to the remainder of that  item or category.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.240(a).)   Code of Civil Procedure section  2031.240, subdivision (b) provides that:   If the responding  party objects to the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling of an  item or category of item, the response shall do both of the following: (1) Identify with  particularity any document, tangible thing, land, or electronically stored  information falling within any category of item in the demand to which an  objection is being made. (2) Set forth  clearly the extent of, and the specific ground for, the objection. If an  objection is based on a claim of privilege, the particular privilege invoked  shall be stated. If an objection is based on a claim that the information  sought is protected work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section  2018.010), that claim shall be expressly asserted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.240(b).)   Further, “[i]f an objection is  based on a claim of privilege or a claim that the information sought is  protected work product, the response shall provide sufficient factual  information for other parties to evaluate the merits of that claim, including,  if necessary, a privilege log.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.240(c)(1).)   A motion to compel further production “shall set forth  specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the  demand.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(b)(1).) Where “there is no privilege  issue or claim of attorney work product, that burden is met simply by a  fact-specific showing of relevance.” (Glenfed Development Corp. v. Superior  Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1113, 1117 (citing Weil & Brown, Cal.  Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial 2 (Rutter 1996) ¶¶ 8:1495.6 to  8:1495.10, pp. 8H–21 to 8H–22).)    To be relevant for purposes of discovery, the information  sought must be relevant to the “subject matter” of the pending action or to the  determination of a motion in that action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2017.010.) The  legal standards for admissibility of evidence at trial is quite different than  the legal standards applicable for purposes of discovery, and materials or  information need not be admissible to be discoverable. (See, e.g., Glenfed  Dev. Corp., supra, 53 Cal.App.4th at 1117 [“Admissibility is not the  test, and it is sufficient if the information sought might reasonably lead to  other, admissible evidence.”]; Gonzalez v. Superior Court (1995) 33  Cal.App.4th 1539, 1546; Davies v. Superior Court (1984) 36 Cal.3d 291,  301.) “Relevancy to the subject matter has been construed to be broader than  relevancy to issues and may vary with the size of the case.” (Bridgestone/Firestone,  Inc. v. Superior Court (Rios) (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1384, 1392 (internal  citations omitted).)   For discovery purposes, information is relevant if it  might reasonably lead to admissible evidence or might reasonably assist a party  in evaluating the case, preparing for trial, or facilitating settlement.  (Gonzalez, supra, 33  Cal.App.4th at 1546; see Code Civ. Proc., § 2017.010 [“…[a]ny party may obtain  discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject  matter involved in the pending action or to the determination of any motion  made in that action, if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or  appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible  evidence.”].) The rules are applied liberally in favor permitting discovery,  which means that the so called “fishing expedition” may be permitted in some  cases. (Stewart v. Colonial Western Agency, Inc. (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th  1006, 1013; see Gonzalez, supra, 33 Cal.App.4th at 1546.) There  is no “single, comprehensive standard of relevancy,” but past cases have  provided certain guidelines.  (Pacific  Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Superior Court (1970) 2 Cal.3d 161, 172.)   In deciding a motion to compel further responses brought  pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310, courts consider not only  the stated objections to the discovery requests, but also the requests  themselves, as well as the pleadings, and the contentions of the propounding  party as to the purpose and validity of the inspection demands. (Columbia  Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Superior Court for Los Angeles County (1968)  263 Cal.App.2d 12, 18.)   Once good cause is shown, the  burden shifts to the party opposing the motion to justify the objection(s). (Kirkland  v. Superior Court (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 92, 97.)   Further, Code of Civil Procedure  section 2031.060, subdivision (b) provides that:   The court, for good  cause shown, may make any order that justice requires to protect any party or  other person from unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression, or undue  burden and expense. This protective order may include, but is not limited to,  one or more of the following directions: (1) That all or some  of the items or categories of items in the demand need not be produced or made  available at all. (2) That the time  specified in Section 2031.260 to respond to the set of demands, or to a  particular item or category in the set, be extended. (3) That the place  of production be other than that specified in the demand. (4) That the  inspection, copying, testing, or sampling be made only on specified terms and  conditions. (5) That a trade  secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information  not be disclosed, or be disclosed only to specified persons or only in a  specified way. (6) That the items  produced be sealed and thereafter opened only on order of the court. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.060(b); see Code Civ. Proc., §  2017.020(a) ["The court shall limit the scope of discovery if it  determines that the burden, expense, or intrusiveness of that discovery clearly  outweighs the likelihood that the information sought will lead to the discovery  of admissible evidence."].)   “The objection based upon burden must be sustained by  evidence showing the quantum of work required, while to support an objection of  oppression there must be some showing either of an intent to create an  unreasonable burden or that the ultimate effect of the burden is incommensurate  with the result sought.” (West Pico Furniture Co. of Los Angeles v. Superior  Court In and For Los Angeles County (1961) 56 Cal.2d 407, 417.) However,  “[w]hen discovery requests are grossly overbroad on their face, and hence do not  appear reasonably related to a legitimate discovery need, a reasonable  inference can be drawn of an intent to harass and improperly burden.” (Obregon  v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424, 431.)  B.      Analysis   1.       Motion to Compel   Here, the Court agrees with  Plaintiff Krystal’s arguments in Opposition and finds that Defendant Cubides  fails to show good cause justifying  further responses to Defendant Cubides’s Request for Production of  Documents, Set One, Nos. 32 and 33.   Defendant Cubides’s Request for  Production of Documents, Set One, Nos. 32 and 33 seeks, respectively, all of Plaintiff Krystal’s bank statements  and tax returns for the last ten (10) years.   In response to Defendant Cubides’s Request for  Production of Documents, Set One, Nos. 32 and 33, Plaintiff Krystal objected on  the grounds that the requests invaded Plaintiff Krystal’s right of privacy, are  overbroad, and are not reasonably  calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.   Defendant Cubides argues that Plaintiff Krystal’s bank  statements and tax returns for the last ten (10) years are relevant because  Plaintiff Krystal holds title to two of the three gasoline service stations  owned and operated by a partnership formed in or about 2004 between Defendant  Cubides, Escamilla, and their respective husbands, Armen and Akop Hakopian, and  Defendant Cubides alleges that “Hakopian and Escamilla, in part through the  vehicle of [Krystal], have converted partnership assets for their personal  benefit and are attempting to leave Cubides holding all of the partnership  liability is the record holder.” (Separate Statement, pp. 2-5; Motion, p. 2.)   However, as argued by Plaintiff Krystal, (Opposition at  p. 4), in her verified responses to discovery propounded by APP, Defendant  Cubides stated that CT Propane is not a partnership, but rather a sole  proprietorship, that she is the only owner of CT Propane, and that the  relationship between her and Escamilla was a landlord-tenant relationship.  (Opposition at p. 3 (citing Mitchel T. Stanton Decl., ¶ 2, Exs. A-C).)   Moreover, Defendant Cubides concedes that Plaintiff  Krystal has a right to privacy in the records at issue, but contends that her  need for the information outweighs Plaintiff Krystal’s privacy interest.  (Motion at pp. 4-5.)  The  California Supreme Court in Hill v. National Collegiate Athletic Assn.  (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1 “sets forth in detail the analytical framework for assessing  claims of invasion of privacy under the state Constitution.” (Pioneer  Electronics (USA), Inc. v. Superior Court (2007) 40 Cal.4th 360, 370  (citing Hill, supra, 7 Cal.4th at 35); accord, Williams, supra,  3 Cal.5th at 552-557.)    “The  party asserting a privacy right must establish a legally protected privacy  interest, an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in the given  circumstances, and a threatened intrusion that is serious.” (Williams, supra,  3 Cal.5th at 552 (citing Hill, supra, 7 Cal.4th at 35-37).)    “The  party seeking information may raise in response whatever legitimate and  important countervailing interests disclosure serves, while the party seeking  protection may identify feasible alternatives that serve the same interests or protective  measures that would diminish the loss of privacy. (Id. (citing Hill,  supra, 7 Cal.4th at 37-40).) “A court must then balance these competing  considerations.” (Ibid.)   If a serious invasion of privacy interest has been  established, the party seeking the information must show “that the information  requested is ‘directly relevant’ to their claims and ‘essential to the fair  resolution’ of their lawsuit.” (Alch v. Superior Court (2008) 165  Cal.App.4th 1412, 1425-1430.)  Defendant Cubides argues that the information “¿is critically important to this case  in that an accounting cannot be prepared without it and it is necessary to  track down where the partnership money has been going over the years,” and “how  the money was transferred would help to identify what sources of information  exist to corroborate the amount, the fact of the transfer itself, and the date of  that transfer.” (Motion, p. 4.) Yet, Defendant Cubides also contends that the  funds at issue were allegedly embezzled and/or converted “from a bank account  in Cubides’ name to Glen Oaks Escrow.” (Motion at p. 2; Separate Statement at  pp. 3, 5.) Thus, the Court agrees with Plaintiff Krystal that Defendant Cubides  can look at her own bank statements to determine this information and already  knows to whom the funds were transferred.   Given the very broad nature of the request and the fact  that Defendant Cubides can look at her own bank statements, the Court finds  that Defendant Cubides fails to sufficiently show that her need for the records  as requested outweighs Plaintiff’s Krystal’s undisputed right to privacy in the  records.   In sum, the Court agrees with Plaintiff Krystal that  Defendant Cubides fails to establish that Plaintiff Krystal’s bank statements  and tax returns for the last ten (10) years might reasonably lead to admissible  evidence or might reasonably assist a party in evaluating the case, preparing  for trial, or facilitating settlement and that Defendant Cubides’s need for the  information outweighs Plaintiff Krystal’s privacy interests in the records.   The Court also considers the fact that Defendant Cubides  failed to file any reply brief.   Accordingly, for all the foregoing reasons, the Motion is  DENIED.   2.      Sanctions   Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310, subdivision (h) provides, in relevant  part:   …the court shall impose a monetary  sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party,  person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel  further response to a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the  sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make  the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(h).)   Since the Motion is denied, the Court also DENIES  Defendant Cubides’s request that the Court impose sanctions against Plaintiff  Krystal.
