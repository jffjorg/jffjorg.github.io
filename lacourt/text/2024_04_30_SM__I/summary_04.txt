And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted Citibank's motion to strike the request for treble damages. Citibank claims it was negligent in transferring money to Sheets, and the court agrees that this does not constitute aiding and abetting fraud. The court notes that aiding and abetting requires intent and that there is no allegation that Citibank knew Sheets was trying to steal the money. The court urges the plaintiff to carefully consider whether to amend the complaint to allege and support a claim that Citibank harbored such ill intent.
