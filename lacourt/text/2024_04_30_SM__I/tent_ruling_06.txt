 Case Number:  SC02545    Hearing Date:   April 30, 2024    Dept:  I The matter is here for a conference regarding the case
status.  The original default was set
aside on April 30, 2021.  On December 27,
2021, the court denied a motion to vacate the new default.  The court noted that an earlier order by the
Court of Appeal had reversed the trial court’s order vacating default and that
therefore the earlier order was infirm. 
This court, though, had a concern about punitive damages.  The default judgment included an award of
punitive damages.  But the amount of such
damages was not mentioned in the prayer nor was there a statement of damages
that set it forth.  This court reasoned
that a judgment including a punitive damage award was, under those
circumstances, unconstitutional on its face. 
The court therefore struck the punitive damages, but allowed the
compensatory award to stand.  Although
asked to change its order in that regard, the court stood firm.  Defendant then moved under Code of Civil
Procedure section 473 for relief from default, confessing to attorney error and
arguing that relief was therefore mandatory. 
The court rejected the request, finding that it came too late.  As such, the default stood.
 
However, there remains the issue of some of the other
defendants.  On January 4, 2024, the
court ordered that a default judgment be entered against them as well.  However, on March 26, 2024, the court vacated
that order given concerns about due process.
 
This hearing is set to figure out exactly what the status is
of this case and what, if anything, remains to be done.
