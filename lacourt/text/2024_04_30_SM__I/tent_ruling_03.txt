 Case Number:  22STCP02558    Hearing Date:   April 30, 2024    Dept:  I This is a motion to file a cross complaint brought by the
Coastal Commission.  It is essentially
defensive in nature, as the court understands it.  It is being brought in the event that the
petition for a writ of administrative mandate is granted (or, perhaps, if
respondent’s motion for judgment is denied). 
The court believes that this motion is best held in abeyance until the
court rules on the motion now under submission. 
This matter is therefore CONTINUED to May 15, 2024, at 9 am.
