 Case Number:  23SMCV06010    Hearing Date:   April 30, 2024    Dept:  I The court will rule on this issue from chambers.  The court does not believe it needs to hear
argument on the subject because the court is inclined to grant the relief
sought as it pertains to the Superior Court (and the court does not really have
the ability to rule as to other courts).
