 Case Number:  21SMCV01053    Hearing Date:   April 30, 2024    Dept:  I The court sees no showing of diligence or any other reason
to continue the trial.  The prior
mediation was almost a year ago; the FSC order was given over two years ago on
December 16, 2021.  The parties had
plenty of time to get everything done.
Absent some better reason to believe that the case will in
fact go away, the court is disinclined to continue the trial, especially at
this late date.  That said, though, the
court will review the trial calendar for May 28, 2024 with counsel.
