I.       INTRODUCTION
          On November
13, 2023, plaintiff Jose Luis Zambrano Moreda filed this action against
defendants Green Ranch Foods, Inc. and Mario Lopez (collectively, “Defendants”)
asserting a single cause of action for motor vehicle negligence arising from a
motor vehicle incident that occurred on November 12, 2021. 
          On
December 6, 2023, a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) was filed which added
Bertha Leticia Breton (“Breton”) as a plaintiff to the same cause of action for
motor vehicle negligence. 
          On
January 11, 2024, Defendants filed this demurrer to the FAC only with respect
to Breton’s claim on the grounds that it is barred by the statute of
limitations. 
          The
demurrer is unopposed.  
II.      LEGAL
STANDARDS
A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency
of the pleadings and will be sustained only where the pleading is defective on
its face.  (City of Atascadero v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.
(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 445, 459.) “We treat the demurrer as admitting all
material facts properly pleaded but not contentions, deductions or conclusions
of fact or law. We accept the factual allegations of the complaint as true and
also consider matters which may be judicially noticed. [Citation.]” (Mitchell v. California Department of Public
Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007; Del
E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604
[“the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true, however improbable
they may be”].) Allegations are to be liberally construed. (Code Civ. Proc., §
452.) In construing the allegations, the court is to give effect to specific
factual allegations that may modify or limit inconsistent general or conclusory
allegations. (Financial Corporation of
America v. Wilburn (1987) 189 Cal.App.3rd 764, 769.) 
III.     DISCUSSION
          A 2-year
statute of limitations period is applicable to personal injury claims. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 335.1.) The alleged incident giving rise to this action occurred
on November 12, 2021. Therefore, the statute of limitations expired on November
13, 2023 (because November 12, 2023 is a Sunday). Breton was not added as a
plaintiff to this action until December 6, 2023. Therefore, Breton’s cause of
action is untimely and the complaint fails to state a cause of action. 
IV.     CONCLUSION
Defendants’ unopposed demurrer to the
FAC with respect to Breton’s claim is SUSTAINED without leave to amend. 
 
Moving party to give notice.
