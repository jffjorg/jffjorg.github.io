Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for a preferential trial date without prejudice. The plaintiff, Nancy Khoa, is seeking a preferential trial date due to her age and the severity of her injuries, which include a T3 burst fracture, traumatic brain injury, and multiple bilateral transverse process fractures and rib fractures. The defendant, City of Alhambra, has opposed the motion, stating that it intends to file a summary judgment motion by the end of March 2024. The judge found that the plaintiff did not demonstrate how advancing a trial date is necessary to avoid prejudicing her interest in the case, and therefore denied the motion without prejudice. The parties are encouraged to submit on the tentative ruling and indicate their intention to do so by email to the court.
