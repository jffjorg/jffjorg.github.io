And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by the defendants to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) is sustained without leave to amend. The demurrer is unopposed and is based on the argument that the claim of Bertha Leticia Breton, who was added as a plaintiff on December 6, 2023, is barred by the statute of limitations. The judge has accepted the factual allegations of the complaint as true and has considered the matter of the statute of limitations. The judge has concluded that the alleged incident occurred on November 12, 2021, and that the statute of limitations expired on November 13, 2023. As a result, the judge has determined that Breton's cause of action is untimely and that the complaint fails to state a cause of action.
