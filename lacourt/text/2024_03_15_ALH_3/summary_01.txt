And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting summary judgment in favor of Defendant Spiniello Co. on the grounds that the plaintiffs' claims are time-barred by the statute of limitations. The plaintiffs had alleged that Defendant installed a water line near their residence without proper spacing, causing damage to their sewer line, and that Defendant acted with willful misconduct and reckless disregard for the consequences. However, the judge found that the plaintiffs failed to meet their burden to show that triable issues of fact exist regarding any alleged "willful misconduct" by Defendant, and that the statute of limitations should apply. The judge also found that Defendant's actions did not constitute reckless disregard for the consequences, and that the plaintiffs' claims are barred by the statute of limitations.
