And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge rules that the defendants' demurrers to the complaint are overruled, meaning that the complaint is sufficient to allege causes of action for negligence, gross negligence, and premises liability. The judge also grants the defendants' motions to strike the claims for punitive damages, finding that the allegations are insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. The judge orders the plaintiff to file and serve a first amended complaint within 30 days, and the defendants to file and serve responses within 30 days thereafter. The judge also notes that the plaintiff may allege different theories of liability under the same facts, and that the allegations of negligence and breach of duty are sufficient to state a cause of action.
