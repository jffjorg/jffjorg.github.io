If the parties
wish to submit on the tentative, please email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with notice to opposing

hearing. 
 
The Court considers the moving papers, opposition, and reply.
 
“(a) If any party desires to obtain discovery by a physical examination
other than that described in Article 2 (commencing with Section 2032.210), or
by a mental examination, the party shall obtain leave of court.  (b) A
motion for an examination under subdivision (a) shall specify the time, place,
manner, conditions, scope, and nature of the examination, as well as the
identity and the specialty, if any, of the person or persons who will perform
the examination. The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Section 2016.040.”  (CCP § 2032.310.)  “The court
shall grant a motion for a physical or mental examination under Section
2032.310 only for good cause shown.”  (CCP § 2032.320(a).) 
 
Defendants move to compel Plaintiff to sit for independent neurological
and orthopedic medical exams. This action arises from a vehicle accident
resulting in personal injury; Plaintiff concedes Defendants’ entitlement to
these exams. 
 
Plaintiff, however, requests that the Court order the examiners to
produce the raw data and audio recordings from the exams to Plaintiff’s
counsel. Defendants assert this compromises the examiner’s opinion, and argue
that the data should only be given to Plaintiff’s opposing expert to interpret.
The Court of Appeal in Randy's Trucking, Inc., et al. v. The Superior Court
of Kern County (2023) 91 Cal.App.5th 818 held that the Court may order
disclosure of this information to Plaintiff’s counsel. The raw data and audio
recordings are relevant and discoverable. 
 
Defendants’ motion is GRANTED.
