And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel the plaintiff to sit for independent neurological and orthopedic medical exams. The plaintiff had previously conceded the defendants' entitlement to these exams. The defendants had requested that the examiners produce the raw data and audio recordings from the exams, but the plaintiff had requested that these records be provided to their counsel instead of just their opposing expert. The judge cited a recent Court of Appeal decision, Randy's Trucking, Inc., et al. v. The Superior Court of Kern County (2023) 91 Cal.App.5th 818, which held that the Court may order disclosure of this information to the plaintiff's counsel. The judge concluded that the raw data and audio recordings are relevant and discoverable, and therefore granted the defendants' motion.
