And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted Defendant Philip Spencer Wright's motion for relief from waiver of objections, finding that Defendant's failure to timely serve responses to Plaintiff's discovery requests was due to mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. The judge has also denied Defendant's motion for a protective order, finding that while Defendant has demonstrated a good faith attempt at informal resolution of the issues, the relief sought is not available under the relevant sections of the Code of Civil Procedure. The judge has limited the scope of discovery, finding that the burden, expense, or intrusiveness of the discovery requests outweighs the likelihood that the information sought will lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
