ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal Standard 
In unlawful
detainer actions, Code of Civil Procedure § 1170.7 provides that “A motion for
summary judgment may be made at any time after the answer is filed upon giving
five days notice. Summary judgment shall be granted or denied on the same basis
as a motion under Section 437c.”  
Here, the issue
of possession has become moot, and the case has become an “ordinary civil
action” in which the landlord may seek damages. (Motion, 5:18-22; Fish
Construction Co. v. Moselle Coach Works, Inc. (1983) 148 Cal.App.3d
645, 658.) As this is no longer an unlawful detainer case, but an
ordinary civil action, there is insufficient notice. CCP section 437c(a)(2)
provides that “[n]otice of the motion and supporting papers shall be served on
all other parties to the action at least 75 days before the time appointed for
hearing.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c(a)(2); see Cuff v. Grossmont Union High
School Dist. (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 582, 596.) If the notice is served by
mail to an address within the State of California, the 75-day period is
increased by 5 days. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 437c(a)(2).) The Court lacks power
to change the notice and filing periods of section 437c. (See McMahon v.
Superior Court (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 112, 115-18; see also Urshan v.
Musicians’ Credit Union (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 758, 765-66 (discussing McMahon
and reversing judgment for failure to provide notice by the statutorily
required minimum time period); Hernandez v. Superior Court (2003) 112
Cal.App.4th 285, 299.) Parties may stipulate to waive the statutorily mandated
minimum notice period. (See Credit Suisse First Boston Mortgage Capital v.
Danning, Gill, Diamond & Kollitz (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 1290, 1301; Lyons
v. Security Pacific National Bank (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1001, 1014.) 
The case
qualifies for § 1179a trial precedence only when possession is in issue (CCP §
1179a). Thus, if the tenant has permanently vacated (returned possession to the
landlord) after commencement of the unlawful detainer, the action is not
triable on the “summary” calendar and not entitled to precedence under CCP §
1179a; it becomes an “ordinary civil action.” (Civ.C. § 1952.)
This is
supported by the rationales in Fish Construction Co., supra, and
Lynch, supra, which Plaintiff cites to in its moving papers, as the summary
procedures in an unlawful detainer action has been removed and the action is
proceeding as an ordinary civil action for rent. Accordingly, the time period
for a motion for summary judgment on the issue of the rent owed and not
possession would follow the ordinary civil time period rather than that of an
unlawful detainer action. 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 437c(p)(1), a plaintiff or
cross-complainant has the initial burden on summary judgment or adjudication of
showing that there is no defense to a cause of action if that party has proved
each element of the cause of action entitling the party to judgment on that
cause of action. Once that burden is met, the burden shifts to the defendant or
cross-defendant to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts
exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.
 
On a motion for summary judgment, the moving party’s supporting
documents are strictly construed and those of his opponent liberally construed,
and doubts as to the propriety of summary judgment should be resolved against
granting the motion. (D’Amico v. Board of Medical Examiners (1974) 11
Cal.3d 1, 21; Binder v. Aetna Life Ins. Co. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 832,
839.)
 
Furthermore, on summary judgment, the issues are defined by the
pleadings. (See Physicians Comm. For Responsible Medicine v. McDonald’s
Corp. (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 554, 568 [“the issues framed by the pleadings
are the only issues a motion for summary judgment must address.”]; FPI
Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367, 382-383; Jordan-Lyon
Prods., ITD., v. Cineplex Odeon Corp. (1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1459, 1472; Bostrom
v. County of San Bernardino (1995) 35 Cal. App. 4th 1654, 1663; 580 Folsom
Assocs. v. Prometheus Dev. Co. (1990) 223 Cal. App. 3d 1, 14, 18 [burden to
address theories “reasonably contemplated by the opponent’s pleading”]; Melican
v. Regents of Univ. of Cal. (2007) 151 Cal. App. 4th 168, 182 [not
requiring party to negate an unstated claim].)
 
Courts cannot decide summary judgment or adjudication motions based
upon credibility. (AARTS Prods., Inc. v. Crocker Nat’l Bank (1986) 179
Cal.App.3d 1061, 1064 [“[T]he role of the court in summary judgment proceedings
is not to weigh the evidence, but to determine whether there exists a triable
issue of material fact.”]; Habitat Trust for Wildlife, Inc. v. City of
Rancho Cucamonga (2009) 175 Cal. App. 4th 1306, 1342.) That said, the
affidavits and declarations of the moving party are strictly construed and
those of the opponent are liberally constructed. (Howe v. Pioneer Mfg Co.
(1968) 262 Cal. App. 2d 330, 336-37.) 
II.        Discussion
Plaintiff argues
that there are no disputed material facts in the case. Plaintiff is asserting a
single cause of action against Defendant for monetary damages. The case
initially involved unlawful detainer but transformed into a civil action for
damages once Defendant vacated the property, rendering the issue of possession
moot. An unlawful detainer is effectively ended if, prior to trial, the issue
of possession has become moot because the tenant has delivered possession to
the landlord. In such event, the case becomes an “ordinary civil action” in
which the landlord may seek damages under Civ. Code § 1951.2, as well as any
other appropriate relief. (Civ. Code § 1952.3(a)]; Fish Const. Co. v.
Moselle Coach Works, Inc. (1983) 148 CA3d 654, 658.)
Plaintiff argues
that defenses related to the unlawful detainer notice are not applicable in a
civil action for monetary damages. In Lynch & Freytag v. Cooper (1990)
218 Cal.3d 603, the landlord sued in unlawful detainer, for possession, rent,
and attorney fees, but the case was converted from unlawful detainer to a civil
action after the issue of possession was withdrawn. At trial, the landlord was
awarded rent and attorney’s fees, and the Court of Appeal affirmed, finding
that the conversion was proper as the tenant was not prejudiced in any way.
Similarly, here, Plaintiff states that Defendant relinquished possession during
the unlawful detainer proceedings, causing the case to transform into an
ordinary civil action under Civil Code § 1952.3, where Plaintiff is seeking
only damages under Civil Code § 1951.2. Consequently, any defects in the three-day
notice to pay rent or quit, or its service, are not valid defenses since the
service of the pay or quit notice was withdrawn. Plaintiff further asserts that
it has satisfied the burden by establishing standing as the owner of the
property, allowing it to prosecute this action as the real party in interest. 
Additionally,
Plaintiff states it has demonstrated that Defendant had a rental agreement,
failed to pay the monthly rent of $3,000 due in July 2023, and vacated the
premises in November 2023.  The evidence
before the court establishes the following material facts.  Plaintiff is owner of the of the residential
real property located at 832 N. Croft Avenue, #106, Los 
Angeles, California 90069. (Wilson Decl. ¶2, Ex. 1). Defendant William Mochon
occupied the Premises pursuant to a written rental agreement. (Wilson Decl. ¶3,
Ex. 1). The monthly rent for premises was $3,000 due on the 1st of
the month. (Wilson Decl. at ¶4, Ex.1). Defendant failed to pay the monthly rent
that came due for July 2023. (Wilson Decl. at ¶5). Defendant vacated the
Premises on 11/16/2023 and did not leave a forwarding address. (Wilson Decl. at
¶6).  The reasonable value of the rent
for the Premises is $100/day. (Wilson Decl. at ¶7). 
Additionally, Plaintiff
argues that affirmative defenses in an unlawful detainer action must be
supported by factual allegations, and it is the defendant’s responsibility to
establish these defenses by a preponderance of the evidence, as per Westernland
Office Service v. Cerbantes (1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 724, 742. Although
detailed factual allegations are not required, the defendant must provide
enough information to give the plaintiff notice to prepare for the defense.
Here, Defendant failed to raise any affirmative defenses or provide factual
support.
The Court finds that
Plaintiff has demonstrated there are no triable issues of material fact in the
case, and that Plaintiff has established its case in chief and is entitled to
monetary damages. The Court finds that defenses related to the unlawful
detainer notice are inapplicable in this civil action for monetary damages. The
case law cited by Plaintiff, including Lynch & Freytag v. Cooper,
supports this position, confirming that the withdrawal of the unlawful detainer
issue does not prejudice Defendant and that the conversion to a civil action
was proper. Plaintiff has established its standing as the property owner,
giving it the legal capacity to prosecute the case as the real party in
interest. Furthermore, Plaintiff has provided uncontested evidence that
Defendant had a rental agreement, failed to pay the $3,000 rent due in July
2023, and vacated the premises in November 2023, and Defendant has not produced
any evidence to dispute these material facts.
Furthermore,
proper notice was provided pursuant to CCP section 437c(a)(2). 
Given these findings, the Court
grants summary judgment in favor of Plaintiff.
