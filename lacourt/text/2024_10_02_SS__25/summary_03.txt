As for the English summary, here it is:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling on a petition to confirm an arbitration award in the amount of $17,588.00. The award was issued on September 22, 2023, and the petition was filed on November 17, 2023. The petition was continued multiple times due to various deficiencies, including the failure to attach a copy of the attorney-client agreement and arbitration provision, as well as the lack of proof of service indicating notice of hearing was given to the respondent.

The judge has reviewed the amended petition, which was filed on August 1, 2024, and finds that it complies with the requirements of the Code of Civil Procedure. However, the judge cannot grant the petition because the respondent has not been given reasonable notice of the hearing. The judge continues the hearing to Monday, October 31, 2024, to allow the petitioner to provide proper notice of the hearing date. The judge orders the petitioner to give notice with proper proof of service.
