 
BACKGROUND
 
On September 22, 2023, Arbitrator Mary J. Dederick (the
“Arbitrator”) issued an arbitration award (the “Award”) in the amount of
$17,588.00 for Petitioner Robert K. Holmes (“Petitioner”) and against
Respondent Marcus Kellum (“Respondent”).
 
On November 17, 2023, Petitioner filed a Petition to
Confirm Attorney-Client Fee Arbitration Award (the “Petition”).  
 
On March 22, 2024, the Court continued the hearing on the
Petition to June 6, 2024, to allow Petitioner to correct numerous deficiencies
in the Petition. (03/22/24 Minute Oder at p. 6.) The Court indicated that
Petitioner failed to attach a copy of the attorney-client agreement and did not
set forth the substance of the arbitration provision in accordance with CCP §
1285.4(a), or otherwise deny the existence of an attorney-client agreement.
(03/22/24 Minute Order at p. 4.) The Court also noted that Petitioner did not
provide a proof of service indicating that both the Petition and notice of the
hearing were served on Respondent, and therefore Petitioner did not satisfy CCP
§ 1290.4. (03/22/24 Minute Order at p. 5.) 
 
On June 6, 2024, after hearing, the Court continued the
hearing on the Petition to July 23, 2024, so that Petitioner could cure the
service defect. (06/06/24 Minute Order at pp. 1-2.) Petitioner was ordered to
give notice. (06/06/24 Minute Order at p. 2.) 
 
On June 7, 2024, the Court issued a nunc pro tunc order,
which indicated, in part, that the hearing on the Petition was continued from
June 6, 2024 to September 11, 2024, and that Petitioner represented that he
intended to submit an Application for Service by Publication as well as an
Application and proposed Order to Post. (06/07/24 Minute Order.)[1] 
 
On June
7, 2024, the Clerk’s Office mailed the Court’s nunc pro tunc order to
Petitioner. 
 
On June
18, 2024, Petitioner filed an Application for Publication, which was rejected
on June 21, 2024, on the grounds that Petitioner needed to provide facts and
evidence to substantiate the need to serve by publication. (See 06/21/24 Notice
of Rejection of Electronic Filing.) 
 
On July 23, 2024, due to the Court’s emergency closure and
connectivity issues, the Court, on its own motion, continued the hearing on the
Petition to August 27, 2024 at 10:00 AM. (07/23/24 Minute Order.) The Court
noted that the Application for Publication was rejected and there was no proof
that Respondent had yet been served with the Petition. (07/23/24 Minute Order.)
Petitioner was ordered to give notice. (07/23/24 Minute Order.) The Clerk’s
office mailed Petitioner a copy of the Court’s order on July 23, 2024. (See
07/23/24 Certificate of Mailing.) 
 
On August
1, 2024, Petitioner filed the instant Amended Petition to Confirm
Attorney-Client Fee Arbitration Award (the “Amended Petition”). 
 
On August
13, 2024, Petitioner served Respondent with the Amended Petition and Amended
Summons. (08/20/24 Proof of Service.) 
 
On August
27, 2024, the Court continued the matter to allow Petition to provide proper
notice of hearing date on Petitioner’s Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award.
Since then, Petitions has filed a Notice of Hearing on Petition to Confirm
Award. However, the Proof of Service states that the documents served is
“Demand for Production and Inspection of Documents and Tangible Things Set
One.” Thus, proof of service is improper.

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Confirming
the Attorney-Client Fee Arbitration Award    
A.               
Legal Standard 
“Any party to an arbitration award in
which an award has been made may petition the court to confirm, correct, or
vacate the award.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1285.) “Once a petition to confirm an
award is filed, the superior court must select one of only four courses of
action: It may confirm the award, correct and confirm it, vacate it, or dismiss
the petition.” EHM Productions, Inc. v Starline Tours of Hollywood, Inc.
(2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 1058, 1063. “[I]t is the general rule that, with
narrow exceptions, an arbitrator’s decision cannot be reviewed for errors of
fact or law.” Ibid.  
“A petition under this chapter shall:
(a) Set forth the substance of or have attached a copy of the agreement to
arbitrate unless the petitioner denies the existence of the agreement. (b) Set
forth the names of the arbitrators. (c) Set forth or have attached a copy of
the award and the written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.” (Code Civ. Proc.
§ 1285.4.) The petition must also “name as respondents all parties to the
arbitration and may name as respondents any other persons bound by the
arbitration award.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.) “A response to a petition under
this chapter may request the court to dismiss the petition or to confirm,
correct or vacate the award.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.2.) 
Code Civ. Proc § 1283.6 provides that
“[t]he neutral arbitrator shall serve a signed copy of the award on each party
to the arbitration personally or by registered or certified mail or as provided
in the agreement.” California Rules of Court, rule 3.825(b)(1) provides that
the arbitrator must file the award with the clerk, with proof of service on
each party to the arbitration. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.825(b)(1).) “A
party may seek a court judgment confirming an arbitration award by filing and
serving a petition no more than four years, but not less than 10 days, after
the award is served on the petitioner.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1288, 1288.4.) 
Code of Civil Procedure § 1290.4, the
statute governing proper service of the Amended Petition states, in pertinent
part:
“(a) A copy of the petition and
written notice of the time and place of the hearing thereof and any other
papers upon which the petition is based shall be served in the manner provided
in the arbitration agreement for the service of such petition and notice. 
(b) If the arbitration agreement does
not provide the manner in which such service shall be made and the person upon
whom service is to be made has not previously appeared in the proceeding and
has not previously been served in accordance with this subdivision: ¶ (1)
Service within this State shall be made in the manner provided by law for the
service of summons in an action; ¶ (2) Service outside this State shall be made
by mailing a copy of the petition and notice of hearing and other papers by
registered or certified mail. Personal service is the equivalent of such
service by mail. Proof of service by mail shall be made by affidavit showing
such mailing together with the return receipt of the United States Post Office
bearing the signature of the person on whom service was made.” 
B.        Discussion  
Petitioner has satisfied the
requirements of CCP § 1285.4. Petitioner has attached a copy of the agreement
to arbitrate. (Amended Petition, p. 2; Amended Petition at Ex. A.) Petitioner has
stated the Arbitrator’s name, Mary J. Dederick, and attaches a copy of the
Award. (Amended Petition, p. 2 at ¶ 4; Attachment 6(c).) The Award provides
that the Petitioner is to be awarded the amount totaling $17,588.20
representing the difference between the $22,588.20 in fees and/or costs which
should have been charged in the matter, and $5,000.00 paid by Respondent.
(Amended Petition at Attachment 6(a) at p. 9:2-17.) Petitioner has now attached
a copy of the attorney-client agreement. (Amended Petition at Ex. A.) Petitioner
has therefore complied with Code of Civil Procedure section 1285.4. 
Here, included with the
Amended Petition is a copy of the proof of service indicating that the
Arbitrator served the Award by mail on both Petitioner and Respondent on
October 2, 2023. The Amended Petition was filed on August 1, 2024, which is
more than ten days after the award was served on Petitioner. 
Petitioner, however, has not
complied with CCP § 1290.4. Despite being ordered by the Court to provide
notice of the continued hearing on the Petition, Petitioner did not file a proof
of service showing effectuation of such notice. (See 07/23/24 Minute Order.) 
Moreover, the Cout cannot
vacate or correct the Award unless Respondent has been given reasonable notice.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1286.4, subd. (b)(2).) Here, the Amended Petition is
unopposed; however, the Court notes that Petitioner has not filed a proof of
service showing that notice of the continued hearing was provided to
Respondent. The Proof of Service filed with the Court is defective since it
states that “Demadn for Production and Inspection of Documents and Tangible
Things Set One” was served on August 27, 2024. 

All moving and supporting
papers must be filed at least 16 court days before the hearing. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) 
Based on the foregoing, the Court
cannot grant the Amended Petition as the Court must ensure that Respondent is
afforded proper notice. 
II.        Conclusion 
            
            The Court therefore CONTINUES the
hearing on the Amended Petition to Monday, October 31, 2024 at 10:00 AM so that
Petitioner can provide proper notice of the hearing date on the Amended
Petition.   
 
            Moving party is ordered to give
notice with proper proof of service.
