And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a case involving Gabrielryan, who is seeking a review of an administrative decision made by the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board (CUIAB). Gabrielryan has submitted an opening brief with four exhibits, including three excerpts from the Administrative Record and a letter from Uber dated January 15, 2023. However, the judge notes that the Uber letter is not part of the administrative record and should not be considered because Gabrielryan did not move to augment the record with this evidence. The judge cites California law and case precedents to support this ruling, stating that extra-record evidence is only admissible if it is relevant and the party seeking to include it shows that it could not have been presented to the agency in the first instance or was improperly excluded.
