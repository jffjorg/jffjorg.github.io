All further statutory references are to the Government Code unless otherwise
stated.

The Legislature has confirmed that the 2023 changes in recodifying the
CPRA were not intended to substantively change the law relating to inspection
of public records.  §7920.100.  Because the parties cite to the version of
the CPRA in effect at the time of the court’s judgment, the court’s citations
shall be to the pre-2023 CPRA except for section 7923.115.

The Registrar asserts the FAP requests ten categories of documents,
dividing Request No. 3 into (1) electronic copies of three hard copy lists of
signatures invalidated for various reasons, and (2) an electronic list of valid
signatures.  Opp. at 2.

The court need not rule on the Committee’s evidentiary objections as they have
no bearing on the outcome of this motion.


[5]
The appellate court noted that the Registrar cited this Elections Code
provision in its appellate argument.  Recall
Gascon, supra, 94 Cal. App. 5th at 367.

The Registrar also argues it has provided the Committee with substantial
resources to expedite its review.  It
agreed to almost triple as many Committee representatives in the examination
room as most reviews, and it provided lists that it does not normally
create.  Flores Decl., ¶¶ 9, 11, 13.  It also responded to 21 CPRA requests beyond
the scope of this litigation.  Flores
Decl., ¶23.  The Registrar diverted $1.3
million in resources to the Recall Petition review, not including attorney’s
costs to defend this action.  Flores
Decl., ¶20.  Opp. at 6.  The Registrar’s effort does not significantly
bear on the Committee’s entitlement to fees.


[7]
The court need not consider the remaining section 1021.5 element of the
necessity and financial burden of private enforcement.
