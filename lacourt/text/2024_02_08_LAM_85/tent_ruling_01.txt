  Case Number:  22STCP03795    Hearing Date:   February 8, 2024    Dept:  85 
 
Committee to Support
the Recall of District Attorney George Gascon v. Dean Logan and Office of the
Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk, 22STCP03795

 
Tentative decision on motion
for (1) attorney’s fees: granted in limited part; (2) costs: denied



            
Petitioner Committee to Support the Recall of District
Attorney George Gascón (“Committee”) moves for an award of $1,166,102.50 in
attorneys’ fees under either Government Code[1]
section 7923.115 or CCP section 1021.5, plus
$13,354.86 in costs, from Respondents Dean Logan (“Logan”) and Office of
the Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk (collectively,
“Registrar”).  In reply, the Committee
reduces the claimed costs to $8,117.32 but asserts an additional $30,000 in
attorney’s fees. 
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply,
and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
            A. Statement of the Case
            1.
First Amended Petition
            Petitioner
Committee filed this proceeding on October 18, 2022.  The operative pleading is the First Amended
Petition (“FAP”), filed on November 16, 2022 and alleging (1) traditional
mandamus and (2) declaratory judgment, and seeking injunctive relief.  The verified FAP alleges in pertinent part as
follows.
            After
his election on December 8, 2020, George Gascón (“Gascón”) took office as the
Los Angeles County (“County”) District Attorney.  Gascón has since introduced controversial
prosecutorial policies that frustrated some residents.  On January 27, 2022, the Registrar approved
the Committee’s request to circulate a petition to recall Gascón (“Recall
Petition”).  The Committee collected
715,833 signatures, 148,976 more than the 566,857 signatures required to
trigger a recall election.  The Committee
submitted the Recall Petition on July 6, 2022.  On July 9, 2022, the Registrar issued a press
release that verified the total number of raw signatures.
            After
the Registrar reviewed a 5% sample, it launched a review of all Recall Petition
signatures.  On August 15, 2022, the
Registrar announced that it had found 195,783 signatures invalid.  This reduced the number of signatures to
46,807 fewer than needed to qualify the Recall Petition for a recall
election.  The reasons cited for invalid
signatures included: (1) 88,464 signatures of voters who were not registered;
(2) 43,593 duplicate signatures; (3) 32,187 signatures from voters with a
different address; (4) 9,490 mismatched signatures; (5) 7,344 “cancelled”
signatures; (6) 5,374 signatures from voters with an out-of-county address; and
(7) 9,331 signatures invalid for one of ten other reasons.
            On
August 18, 2022, the Committee informed the Registrar that it intended to
exercise its statutory right, under Elections Code section 11301 and section
6253.5, to examine the Recall Petition to assess “which signatures were
disqualified and the reasons therefor.” 
On August 19, the Registrar replied that the Committee could review the
Recall Petition and the voter record data or information that led to the
disqualification of each signature.  Such
review would occur at the Registrar’s office during business hours.
            On
August 29, 2022, the Registrar restricted the review process whereby (1) the
Committee could examine Petition signatures at the Registrar’s office only on Tuesday
through Thursday, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.; (2) only 14 Committee representatives
would be permitted per day; (3) Committee representatives would be limited to use
of seven computer workstations; and (4) each computer workstation would be
operated by one staff person from the Registrar’s office.  
The Committee made a good faith effort to comply with these
restrictions beginning on September 6, 2022. 
Progress has been slow, and the Registrar has not provided access to all
voter signatures on file, prior addresses of registered voters, and other
crucial pieces of information needed to determine whether a signature found
invalid was actually valid.  In other
instances, the Registrar has provided this information in printed form, which
slows down the Committee’s review.  The
Registrar has also refused to answer questions, ignoring them or claiming that
the answers are beyond the scope of the examination process.  It has also failed to provide information on
Runbeck’s EMS-DIMS Election Management System (“DIMS”) for voter registration, such
as the abbreviations the system uses.
            The
difficulties the Committee has faced make it clear that timely review of the
Registrar’s findings is impossible with current parameters.  At the current rate, the Committee would need
18 months to review the disqualified signatures which in effect denies the
Committee of its right to review under section 6253.5.  
            The
Committee seeks a writ of mandate compelling timely production of (1) all
signatures on file for voters whose signature was rejected as a mismatched
signature (“Request No. 1”); (2) for all persons whose signature was rejected
because the voter’s residence address on the Recall Petition did not match the
voter’s registered address, an electronic list of the voters’ prior addresses,
dates of all changes, the reason, and notice provided for involuntary changes
(“Request No. 2”); (3) a list of voters whose signatures were valid, invalid as
a duplicate, invalid because registration was cancelled due to death, and
invalid for “fatal pending” (“Request No. 3”); (4) all training materials or
user manuals for DIMS to interpret the data contained in the system (“Request
No. 4”); (5) all comments, notes, or notations made in the voter files of
rejected signatures (“Request No. 5”); (6) all voter files that may exist for
those voters with rejected signatures, cancelled or not (“Request No. 6”); (7)
the original affidavits of registration including re-registrations for voters
with rejected signatures (“Request No. 7”); (8) an electronic list of all
voters whose Petition signatures were rejected during the random sample review
(“Request No. 8”); and (9) all data and information the Registrar relied on in
rejecting a Petition signature (“Request No. 9”).
            The
Committee also seeks a writ of mandate compelling the Registrar to agree that
(1) Committee representatives may examine the Recall Petition five days per
week; (2) up to 25 representatives may examine the Recall Petition at one time;
(3) Committee representatives can use up to 25 computer workstations; and (4)
Committee representatives may use personal electronic devices during the review
process.
            The
Committee requests (1) a temporary restraining order (“TRO”), preliminary
injunction, and/or permanent injunction mandating that the Registrar provide
the requested documents and requested access, (2) a judicial declaration that
Respondents acted unlawfully when they chose not to do so, and (3) attorney’s
fees and costs.
 
            2. Course of Proceedings
            On
October 25, 2022, the court heard the Committee’s ex parte application for
an order to show cause re: preliminary injunction
(“OSC”) compelling the Registrar to (1) comply with Request Nos. 1-4 and (2) provide
the access requested in the FAP.  The
court granted the ex parte
application and issued the OSC.  
On
the same day, the Committee served Respondents with the Petition, Summons, and ex parte
application.  
            On
November 17, 2022, the court heard and denied the Committee’s ex parte
application for leave to file a supplemental brief in support of the OSC.  
            On
December 6, 2022, the court granted in part the Committee’s application for a
preliminary injunction.  The Registrar
was ordered to allow the Committee to review prior signatures on file for voters whose
signatures were denied because of a mismatch (Request No. 1).  It was also required to produce
electronic copies of the existing lists subject to a strict protective order to
be negotiated by the parties, as well as a hard copy list of valid signatures
for the petition.  (Request No. 3).  The Registrar was not required to allow review of addresses and change
of address notices for voters whose residence address on the Recall
Petition did not match the voter’s registered address (Request No. 2).  It was also not required to produce
additional training materials or user manuals for DIMS to interpret the data
contained in the system (Request No. 4), but the parties were to meet and
confer on the completeness of disclosures.
            On
December 16, 2022, the Registrar filed its Answer.
            On January 30,
2023, the court granted the Committee’s application for an order to enforce the
preliminary injunction.
            On January 31,
2023, the Registrar filed a notice of appeal from the decision granting the
Committee’s application for a preliminary injunction.
            On July 27, 2023,
the court found this case related to Committee v. Registrar, (“Committee
II”) Case No. 23STCP02365, and consolidated them before this court.
            On August 10,
2023, the Second Appellate District Court of Appeal issued a decision
dismissing the appeal to the December 6, 2022 order granting preliminary
injunction, but granting the appeal for this court’s January 23, 2023 order to
the extent it (1) authorized use of electronic lists outside the Registrar’s
examination room, and (2) commanded disclosure of redacted affidavits of voter
registration.  The appellate court
ordered both parties to bear their own costs on appeal.
            On August 16,
2023, Department 1 unrelated this case and Committee II, and returned
this case to Department 85 and returned Committee II to Department 86
(Hon. Mitchell Beckloff).
            On October 10,
2023, this court issued a revised order pursuant to the Second Appellate
District’s August 10, 2023 decision, effective once remittitur was issued.  This remittitur was filed on October 11,
2023.
            On November 27,
2023, the court dismissed the FAP in this case as moot after the Committee
informed it the examination was complete.
            
            B. Applicable Law
            1.
CPRA Attorney’s Fees
            Section 7923.115 (“section
7923.115”), formerly section 6259,[2] provides
in part: “If the requester prevails in litigation filed pursuant to this
chapter, the court shall award court costs and reasonable attorney’s fees to
the requester.”  §7923.115(a).  The costs and fees shall be paid by the
public agency of which the public official is a member or employee and shall
not become a personal liability of the public official.  Id.
            The
attorney’s fee provision of the CPRA should be interpreted in light of the
overall remedial purpose of the Act to broaden access to public records.  Community Youth Athletic Center v. City of
National City, (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1447.  Indeed, the purpose of the attorney’s fees
provision is to provide protections and incentives for members of the public to
seek judicial enforcement of their right to inspect public records subject to
disclosure.  Community Youth Athletic
Center v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th at 1447.  The use of the word “shall” in a fee statute
means the award is mandatory and, as such, an award of fees to prevailing petitioner
in a CPRA action is mandatory.  Belth
v. Garamendi, (1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 896, 899-900.  
            Generally,
the plaintiff prevails for purposes of attorney’s fees under the CPRA “when he
or she files an action which results in defendant releasing a copy of a
previously withheld document.”  Belth
v. Garamendi, (1991) 232 Cal. App. 3d 896, 898.  Cases denying attorney’s fees to a plaintiff
under the CPRA have done so because “litigation did not cause the [agency] to
disclose any of the documents ultimately made available…”  Motorola Communication & Electronics,
Inc. v. Department of General Services, (1997) 55 Cal. App. 4th 1340, 1351;
Rogers v. Superior Court, (1993) 19 Cal. App. 4th 469, 483.  
 
            2.
Section 1021.5
            CCP
section 1021.5 (“section 1021.5”) codifies the “private attorney general”
exception to the general rule that each side bears its own fees unless the
parties contracted otherwise.  See CCP §1021.  Section 1021.5 permits
a trial court to award fees to a successful party in any action that: “has
resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest
if (a) a significant benefit has been conferred on the general public or a
large class of persons, (b) the necessity and financial burden of private
enforcement are such as to make the award appropriate, and (c) such fees should
not in the interest of justice be paid out of the recovery.  The issue is
committed to the trial court’s discretion.  Flannery v. California
Highway Patrol, (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 629, 634. 
            Courts
take a “broad, pragmatic view of what constitutes a ‘successful party’” in
order to effectuate the policy underlying section 1021.5.  Graham v.
DaimlerChrysler Corp. (2004) 34 Cal.4th 553, 565.  The party seeking
attorney’s fees need not prevail on all
of its alleged claims in order to qualify for
an award.  Harbor v. Deukmejian, (1987) 43 Cal.3d 1078, 1103; Daniels
v. McKinney, (1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 42, 55.  The party is considered
successful under section 1021.5 if the litigation “contributed substantially to
remedying the conditions at which it was directed.” Planned Parenthood v.
Aakhus, (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 162, 174.  In other words, the
successful party under section 1021.5 is the party that succeeds on “any
significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties
sought in bringing suit.”  Maria P. v. Riles, (1987) 43 Cal.3d
1281, 1292; see Tipton-Whittingham v. City of Los Angeles, (2004)
34 Cal.4th 604, 610.  A successful party who qualifies for an award under
section 1021.5 is entitled to compensation for all hours reasonably spent by
their counsel.  Serrano v. Unruh, (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 632–33. 
            Unlike the
separate substantial benefit doctrine, “the ‘significant benefit’ that will
justify an attorney fee award need not represent a ‘tangible’ asset or a
‘concrete’ gain but, in some cases, may be recognized simply from the
effectuation of a fundamental constitutional or statutory policy.” Woodland
Hills Residents Assn., Inc. v. City Council, (1979) 23 Cal.3d 917,
939.  “[T]he benefit may be conceptual or doctrinal and need not be actual or
concrete; further, the effectuation of a statutory or constitutional purpose
may be sufficient.”  Braude v. Automobile Club of Southern Cal.,
(1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 994, 1011.  Moreover, the extent of the public
benefit need not be great to justify an attorney fee award.  See, e.g.,
Protect Our Water v. County of Merced, (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 488, 496
(significant public benefit where litigation prompted agency to improve methods
of creating and managing its CEQA records). The trial court determines “the
significance of the benefit, as well as the size of the class receiving
benefit, from a realistic assessment, in light of all the pertinent
circumstances, of the gains which have resulted in a particular case.”  Woodland
Hills, supra, 23 Cal.3d at 939–940. 
            The party
seeking attorney’s fees must show that the necessity for pursuing the lawsuit
placed a burden on the plaintiff “out of proportion to his individual stake in
the matter.” Woodland Hills, supra, 23 Cal. 3d at 941. 
Although cases refer to this requirement as the “financial burden” criterion,
nothing in the language of CCP section 1021.5 limits the consideration of the
necessity and financial burden clause to solely financial interests.  Hammond
v. Agran, (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 115, 125.  “The idea is that the
litigation for which fees are claimed must transcend one's interests, whether
pecuniary or not.”  Id. at 127.  The question is whether
advancement of the public interest was merely coincidental to the attainment of
the party’s personal goals.  Bowman v. City of¿Berkeley (“Bowman”)
(2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 173, 181.  The party seeking attorney’s fees bears
the burden of establishing that its litigation costs transcend its personal
interests.  Save Open Space Santa Monica Mountains v. Superior Court,
(“Save Open Space”) (2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 235, 247.  The trial
court's application of the financial burden criterion involves a “realistic and
practical comparison of the litigant's personal interest with the cost of
suit.” Families Unafraid to Uphold Rural El Dorado County v. Bd. of
Supervisors (“Families Unafraid”), (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 505, 515. 
 
C. Statement of
Facts
            1. Committee’s Evidence
            a.
Background
            On
January 27, 2022, the Registrar approved the form and wording of the Committee’s
request to circulate a Recall Petition for Gascón.  Thompson Decl., ¶2.  The Committee collected 715,833 signatures,
148,976 more than the 566,857 signatures required to trigger a recall
election.  Thompson Decl., ¶¶ 2-3, Ex. 1.  The Committee submitted the signatures to the
Registrar on July 6, 2022.  Thompson
Decl., ¶3.
            On
July 9, 2022, the Registrar issued a press release confirming that it had received
715,833 raw signatures.  Thompson Decl.,
¶3, Ex. 1.  The press release explained
that the Registrar would use a 5% sample of signatures to decide if it needed
to review all signatures.  Thompson
Decl., ¶3, Ex. 1.  
            On
August 15, 2022, the Registrar announced that it had found 195,783 signatures
invalid.  Thompson Decl., ¶4, Ex. 2.  This reduced the number of valid signatures
to 520,050, which was 46,807 fewer than needed to qualify the Recall Petition
for a recall election.  Thompson Decl.,
¶4, Ex. 2.  The reasons cited for the
invalid signatures included: (1) 88,464 signatures of persons not registered to
vote; (2) 43,593 duplicate signatures; (3) 32,187 signatures from persons with
a different address; (4) 9,490 mismatched signatures; (5) 7,344 “cancelled”
signatures; (6) 5,374 signatures from those with an out-of-county address; and
(7) 9,331 signatures invalid for one of ten “other” reasons.  Thompson Decl., ¶4, Ex. 2.  
            On
August 18, 2022, the Committee informed the Registrar via email that it
intended to exercise its statutory right to examine the Recall Petition to
assess which signatures were disqualified and why.  Thompson Decl., ¶5, Ex. 3.
            On
August 19, 2022, the Registrar replied that the Committee could review the
Recall Petition and the voter record data that led to the disqualification of
each signature.  Thompson Decl., ¶6, Ex. 4.  If the Committee had any questions during the
review, it could submit them in writing. 
Thompson Decl., ¶6, Ex. 4.  The
Registrar warned the Committee that Govt. Code section 6253.5 did not provide a
method to challenge the certificate of results if the Committee found that
invalidated signatures were valid.  Thompson
Decl., ¶6, Ex. 4.  
 
            b.
Restrictions on the Review
            On
August 29, 2022, the Registrar imposed several restrictions on the Committee’s examination.  Thompson Decl., ¶7.  Only 14 Committee members could conduct the
review three days per week on no more than seven computer workstations, which
the Registrar staff had to operate. 
Thompson Decl., ¶7.  Committee
members also could not use personal electronic devices for recordkeeping
purposes.  Thompson Decl., ¶7.  
            The
Registrar also declined to provide the Committee with access to the following
data and records.
a.      
The Committee asked for access to all signatures on
file for each voter.  The Registrar only
allows Committee members to review one sample signature on file for each
voter.  Thompson Decl., ¶8(a).  But 2 CCR section20960(i) required Registrar
examiners to compare the signature on the Recall Petition with all
signatures in the record.  Thompson
Decl., ¶8(a).  
b.     
The Committee asked for an electronic copy of the list
and report of signatures invalidated as duplicates, but the Registrar only
provided a 1700-page physical copy. 
Thompson Decl., ¶8(b).  The
Registrar would not allow the Committee to take this outside of the examination
room or to mark it.  Thompson Decl., ¶8(b).  This made the review process far more
laborious as the Committee wrote down every duplicate signature, reviewed every
page with a duplicate signature, and took handwritten notes on each.  Thompson Decl., ¶8(b).
c.      
The Committee requested electronic lists or reports
from the Petition Signer Module that identify all voters whom the Registrar
found submitted a valid signature for the Recall Petition.  Thompson Decl., ¶8(c), Ex. 5.  The Registrar refused to provide these lists.  Thompson Decl., ¶8(c).  It also refused to check whether a particular
signature was rejected or validated when the challenge code was missing for
that signature.  Thompson Decl.,
¶8(c).  This left the Committee unable to
efficiently determine whether a signature was validated or not.  Thompson Decl., ¶8(c).  Comparison of petition signatures with an
electronic list of validated signatures from the Petition Singer Module would
have enabled the Committee to determine if the Module count is inaccurate.  Thompson Decl., ¶8(c).  Otherwise, the Committee would have had to go
through all 715,833 signatures and cross-check each against printed lists of
rejected signatures.  Thompson Decl., ¶8(c).
d.     
The Committee requested electronic lists or reports for
signatures invalidated for death or “fatal pending” and received only printed
lists.  Thompson Decl., ¶8(d), Exs. 6-7.  
e.      
The Committee asked for all signatures rejected because
the voter’s residence address on the Recall Petition did not match the voter’s
registered address, spreadsheets of prior addresses on file, dates of all
changes, the reason for each change, and notice provided to the voter for
involuntary address changes.  Thompson
Decl., ¶8(e).  The report the Registrar
provided shows only when the voter changed or updated its address during the
circulation period.  Thompson Decl., ¶8(e).  The Registrar initially refused to provide
voter notifications.  Thompson Decl.,
¶8(e), Ex. 8.  It later agreed to produce
voter notifications but warned that it would not begin the search until
December 5, 2022.  Id., Ex. 9.
f.       
On September 13, 2022, the Committee asked for a list
of the names and voter ID numbers for the signatures rejected during the random
sampling.  Thompson Decl., ¶8(f), Ex.
37.  The Registrar only agreed to do so
after the Committee filed the Petition. 
Thompson Decl., ¶8(f).
            On
September 21, 2022, Committee’s counsel sent the Registrar a letter demanding
that it (1) produce all requested documents for “mismatch” or “different
address” signatures; (2) expand the number of Committee representatives who can
participate in the review to 25; (3) expand the number of workstations to 25;
(4) permit review on five days per week; (5) provide training or other
materials that explain the DIMS software; and (6) respond to all questions that
the Committee asks within 48 hours.  Thompson
Decl., ¶9, Ex. 10.
            The
Registrar responded on September 26, 2022 that it answered all the questions
and requests that were in the scope of authorized review under Govt. Code
section 6253.5 and the remaining questions were beyond that scope.  Thompson Decl., ¶9, Ex. 11.  It also alleged that the Committee did not
have as many designees conducting the review as currently allowed.  Thompson Decl., ¶9, Ex. 11.  The parameters in place ensure the
preservation of the Recall Petition, protect voter data not subject to public
disclosure, operate within COVID-19 safety guidelines, and allocate public
resources between the Committee’s inspection and the upcoming general
election.  Thompson Decl., ¶9, Ex.
11.  The Govt. Code authorizes a review
to determine which signatures were disqualified and why, not to audit the
process the Registrar used to do so.  Thompson
Decl., ¶9, Ex. 11.  The Registrar would
continue its current level for support for the inspection, except that it may
decrease it in response to the then-upcoming election.  Thompson Decl., ¶9, Ex. 11.  
 
            c.
Course of Proceedings
            (1).
The FAP
            On
November 16, 2022, the Committee filed the FAP. 
Carroll Decl., ¶2, Ex. 15 (FAP). 
The FAP asserted that the Registrar had suppressed data that may suggest
a rejection of a signature from the Recall Petition was improper.  FAP, ¶5. 
California law specifically guarantees the proponents of a recall the
right to review whether public officials have properly rejected a recall
petition.  FAP, ¶1.  However, the purpose of this review is
eviscerated unless the Committee has access to the voter record data or
information that led to the disqualification of a signature.  FAP, ¶5. 
That would allow the Committee to determine for itself whether a
signature was properly rejected.  FAP,
¶5.  The FAP invoked the CPRA and CCP
section 1085 to enforce its right to such review.  FAP, ¶5. 

            The
first prayer for relief sought production of documents pursuant to nine
Requests.[3]
 FAP Prayer for Relief, ¶1.  The argument that the Committee was entitled
to these items often cited the CPRA. 
FAP, ¶27.  The FAP also asked for
a writ of mandate compelling the Registrar to permit (1) the use of electronic
devices in review, (2) an increase in the number of days for the review to five
days per week, and (3) an increase in number of representatives and computer
stations to twenty-five each.  FAP Prayer
for Relief, ¶2.  
 
            (2).
The Preliminary Injunction
            On
October 24, 2022, the Committee filed the ex parte application for an OSC compelling the Registrar to
(1) comply with Request Nos. 1-4 and (2) provide the access requested in the
FAP.  Carroll Decl.,
¶3.  The court granted the ex parte application and issued the OSC, with the hearing set
for December 6, 2022.  Carroll
Decl., ¶3.  Until then, the parties were
to meet and confer to narrow the issues in dispute.  Carroll Decl., ¶3.  The court also expressed its preliminary
views on several of the items, stating that the Registrar was unduly
restricting access to the Recall Petition and should provide the requested
electronic lists.  Carroll Decl.,
¶3.  
            During
the subsequent meet and confer sessions, the Registrar refused to provide any
of the requested records but did agree to incrementally increase the
Committee’s access.  Carroll Decl., ¶4.
            During
the December 6, 2022 OSC hearing, the court ruled that, aside from the
requested notifications and manuals, this was not a CPRA case.  Carroll Decl., ¶5, Ex. 17, p. 38.  However, it did seem that the Committee
should have electronic files solely as a matter of convenience.  Ex. 17, p. 38.  The Registrar had no reason to refuse
production of electronic files, provided the Committee could not take them out
of the examination room.  Ex. 17, p.
38.  
            The
court also said that it seemed the Registrar had provided more than the
Committee was entitled to have.  Ex. 17, p. 45. 
In a case of “no good deed goes unpunished”, the Committee now wanted
the electronic version.  OSC Tr., p.
45.  The court asked the Registrar if
that would speed up the review process so that the Committee would finish by
the end of March.  Ex, 17, pp.
45-46.  The Committee replied that deadline
was the hope.  OSC Tr., p. 46.
            This
court granted the preliminary injunction in part.  Carroll Decl., ¶5, Ex. 16.  Per
Request No. 1, the Registrar was ordered to allow
the Committee to review all prior
signatures on file for voters whose signatures were denied because of a
mismatch.  Carroll Decl., ¶5, Ex.
16.  Per Request No. 3, the Registrar was required to produce electronic
copies of the existing lists subject to a strict protective order to be
negotiated by the parties, as well as a hard copy list of valid signatures for
the petition.  Carroll Decl., ¶5, Ex. 16.  The Registrar was not required to allow review of addresses and change
of address notices for voters whose residence address on the Recall
Petition did not match the voter’s registered address.  Carroll Decl., ¶5, Ex. 16.  It
was also not required to produce additional training materials or user manuals
for DIMS to interpret the data contained in the system.  Carroll Decl., ¶5, Ex. 16.  However, the parties were to meet and confer
on the completeness of disclosures. 
Carroll Decl., ¶5, Ex. 16.  
            Although the court refused
to set specific access requirements, it did order the parties to meet
and confer regularly to work towards completion of the review by March 31,
2023.  Carroll Decl., ¶5, Ex. 16; Ex. 17,
p. 60.  If satisfactory progress was not
being made, the parties were to return to the court on an ex parte
basis.  Carroll Decl., ¶5, Ex. 16.  The Committee’s use of electronic devices
would also be permitted pursuant to an appropriate protective order in which
they could be used for the legitimate
purposes of note taking, data entry, and internet searches with the camera
featured covered and an order that no pictures or videos be taken.  Carroll Decl., ¶5, Ex. 16.  
            The
parties made little progress in meet and confer sessions during the next 45
days.  Carroll Decl., ¶6.  On December 30, 2022, the Registrar provided
a Recall Random Sample Report.  Carroll
Decl., ¶6.  On January 20, 2023, it
produced voter notification card spreadsheets.  
Carroll Decl., ¶6.  On March 1,
2023, it produced voter notification cards returned as undeliverable.  Carroll Decl., ¶6.  
 
            (3).
Enforcement
            On
January 23, 2023, the Committee filed an ex parte application to enforce
the preliminary injunction.  Carroll
Decl., ¶7.  The Registrar filed an ex
parte application to clarify the preliminary injunction and set the Committee’s
preliminary injunction bond to $985,000. 
Carroll Decl., ¶7.  
            At
the hearing on these applications, the court asked for a reminder of what right
the Committee had to electronic records. 
Carroll Decl., ¶7, Ex. 18, p. 243. 
The Committee confirmed that the court had just ordered for electronic
records because it believed that would save a lot of time during the
review.  Ex. 18, p. 243.  As for the Registrar’s bond application, the
court acknowledged that a bond was required and, after argument, set the bond
at $500.  Ex. 18, p. 304.
            On
January 30, 2023, the court issued an order partly granting both applications.  See Carroll Decl., Ex. 22.  It authorized the Committee’s use of
electronic data outside the examination room, subject to a protective order.  See Carroll Decl., Ex. 22.  It also compelled the Registrar to disclose
redacted hardcopy affidavits of registration. 
See Carroll Decl., Ex. 22.
 
            (4).
Appeal
            On
February 3, 2023, the Registrar appealed the court’s preliminary injunctive
orders.  Carroll Decl., ¶8.  It notified the Committee via email that
because the appeal subjected the orders to an automatic stay, the Registrar
would not provide any electronic signature lists pending the appeal.  Carroll Decl., ¶8, Ex. 19.  
            Because
of the time-sensitive nature of the examination process, the Registrar moved to
expedite the appeal hearing.  Carroll
Decl., ¶9.  The appellate court granted
the motion.  Carroll Decl., ¶9, Ex. 21.  
            The
Committee moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.  Carroll Decl., ¶9, Ex. 22 (Comm. to Recall
Gascon v. Logan, (“Recall Gascon”) (2023) 94 Cal. App. 5th 352, 358).  The Committee argued that an order of the
court either directing disclosure or supporting a public official’s decision to
refuse disclosure under the CPRA is not a final judgment under CCP section
904.1.  Govt. Code §7923.500(a); Recall
Gascon, supra, 94 Cal. App. 5th at 358.  Any appellate review of such an order must
therefore be reviewed by petition to the appellate court for issuance of an
extraordinary writ.  Govt. Code
§7923.500(a); Recall Gascon, supra, 94
Cal. App. 5th at 358.  Under Govt.
Code section 7923.500(b), a party must file such a petition within 20 days of
service of a written notice of entry of the order, although the trial court may
for good cause allow a 20-day extension. 
Recall Gascon, supra, 94 Cal. App. 5th at 371.
            In
its August 10, 2023 opinion, the appellate court held that the Registrar had
appealed from non-appealable orders under Govt. Code section 7923.500(a).  Id. at 367.  This court had granted the preliminary
injunction for electronic lists (Request No. 3) and notations in the
Registrar’s data management files (Request No. 5) under Govt. Code sections
7924.110.  Id. at 362.  The orders either commanded the Registrar to
disclose records in hardcopy and/or electronic form or support the Registrar's
refusal to do so based on exemptions under the CPRA.  Id. at 367.  The Registrar’s own appellate argument cited
Govt. Code section 7924.110(b)(2) and Elections Code section 2194.  Id. 

            The
Registrar asserted that it worked with the Committee to expedite the examination.  Id. 
However, it also relied on the stay pending appeal to refuse documents
previously ordered by the trial court.  Id.
at 369-70.  This resistance reflected the
very dangers Govt. Code sections 7924.110 and 7923.500 seek to avoid.  Id. at 370.  To effectuate their purpose and harmonize the
examination procedures set in Govt. Code section 7924 et seq. with the
rest of the CRPA, the court construed section 7923.500 as covering orders directing
or refusing disclosure of records in connection with the examination of an
unsuccessful recall petition.  Id.
            The
appellate court dismissed most of the appeal from the trial court’s December
2022 preliminary injunction order for lack of jurisdiction.  Id. at 371.  Because the Registrar’s appeal was untimely
as to the December 2022 injunction order, the appellate court lacked
jurisdiction to consider its merits.  Id.
            The
trial court’s January 30, 2023 order did fall within the jurisdictional
deadline.  Id. at 372.  Of the issues therein, the appellate court declined
to consider the bond amount.  Id.
at 372-73  The appellate court reviewed and
reversed the trial court’s January 30 order’s new directives (1) allowing the
Committee to use electronic voter lists outside the examination room and (2) compelling
the disclosure of current and former affidavits of voter registration, and (3)
ordering redacted hard copies of affidavits of registration.  Id. at 373-78.  
 
            (5).
Committee II
            On
July 7, 2023, the Committee filed the petition in Committee II.  Carroll Decl., ¶12, Exs. 23-24.  The petition asserted the Registrar
improperly denied the Recall Petition due to an inflated signature requirement,
incorrectly rejected signatures, and unlawfully rejected signatures.  Carroll Decl., ¶12, Ex. 24.
            
            d.
Costs
            The
law firm Ellis George Cipollone O’Brien LLP (“EGC”) incurred $13,270.86 in
costs.  Carroll Decl., ¶14, Exs. 33-34.  Kathleen Cady incurred another $84.  Carroll Decl., ¶14, Ex. 36.
 
            2.
Registrar’s Evidence[4]
            a.
The Examination
            When
the Registrar conducted a random sampling of the signatures on the Recall
Petition, it concluded 72.55% of the 519,362 signatures would be valid.  Flores Decl., ¶5.  This would mean it only had 91.6% of the
signatures needed to qualify.  Flores
Decl., ¶5.  Per Elections Code section
1122(c), the Registrar began a full count to verify all signatures.  Flores Decl., ¶5.  
            The
Registrar completed the full count on August 15, 2022.  Flores Decl., ¶6.  It found that of the 195,783 invalid
signatures, 88,464 were not registered to vote, 43,593 were duplicates, 32,187
had different addresses, 9,490 contained mismatched signatures, 7,344 were
canceled, 5,374 had an out-of-county address, and 9,331 were invalid for other
reasons.  Flores Decl., ¶6.
            When
the Committee asked to inspect the Recall Petition per Elections Code section
11301 and Govt. Code section 7924.110, the Registrar agreed to let the Committee
review the disqualified signatures and the reasons for disqualification.  Flores Decl., ¶7.  The Registrar’s procedures for such
examinations under Govt. Code section 7924.110 comply with policies articulated
in the Failed Petitioner Examination Guidelines distributed by the California
Association of Clerks and Election Officials. 
Flores Decl., ¶8.
            On
August 29, 2022, the parties met to discuss the inspection date and hours.  Flores Decl., ¶9.  Although the Registrar wanted to limit the
Committee’s review to 10 participants at 5 computer stations, it agreed to 14
participants at 7 stations three days per week from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.  Flores Decl., ¶9.  This was large compared to most reviews,
which involve only 3-5 representatives. 
Flores Decl., ¶9.  
            On
September 7, 2022, the Committee purchased a printout of the names and voter
information for all signatures on the Petition that were invalidated, including
the reason for each invalidation.  Flores
Decl., ¶11.  It purchased a PDF copy of
this on CD on September 19.  Flores
Decl., ¶11.  
            Because
almost 200,000 signatures were disqualified, the Registrar provided hard copy
lists of voters whose signatures were disqualified as (1) duplicate signatures,
(2) voters whose address did not match the affidavit of registration, (3)
voters whose signatures did not match, and (4) signers who are deceased.  Flores Decl., ¶13.  These lists were made specifically for the
Committee’s review, are not usually made available in the petition examination
process, and include non-public voter information.  Flores Decl., ¶13.  The Registrar made this list with the understanding
the Committee would only use this information in the examination room to
expedite the review process.  Flores
Decl., ¶13.  
            After
the General Election, the Registrar agreed to increase the number of
representatives from 14 to 20.  Flores
Decl., ¶21.  Even after that, the
Committee never had 20 volunteers in the examination room.  Flores Decl., ¶21.  Sign-in sheets show an average of less than
nine per day over 186 days, with more than 14 only on 27 of those days.  Flores Decl., ¶21, Ex. A.  Despite this, the Committee demanded access
for 25 representatives to 25 computer stations.  Flores Decl., ¶21.
            Outside
of this litigation, the Registrar has responded to 21 CPRA requests from the
Committee between September 2022 and November 2023.  Flores Decl., ¶23.  One request was for voter notification
cards.  Flores Decl., ¶24.  The Registrar could not do this during the
normal timeframe because of election deadlines and responsibilities.  Flores Decl., ¶24.  It told the Committee it would provide these
cards after the election, but the Committee still included that request in this
action.  Flores Decl., ¶24.  After some confusion over what the Committee
wanted, the Registrar provided tens of thousands of cards.  Flores Decl., ¶24.  
            The
Registrar diverted $1.3 million in resources to the Recall Petition Review, not
including attorney’s costs to defend this action.  Flores Decl., ¶20.           The Committee’s Recipient Committee Campaign Statement for
October through December 2022 shows it spent over $8 million to qualify the
Recall Petition.  Gevercer Decl., Ex.
C.  
            
            b.
Course of Proceedings
            In
its December 6, 2022 tentative on the Committee’s application for a preliminary
injunction, the court held that, for Request No. 1, Elections Code section 11301
and then-Govt. Code section 6253.5 only permit inspection of a recall petition
and the memoranda prepared by county election officials.  Gevercer Decl., Ex. A, p. 15.  Notwithstanding any other law, Elections Code
section 2194(b)(2) deems voter signatures on affidavits of registration
confidential.  Gevercer Decl., Ex. A, p.
15.  Under Elections Code section
2194(c)(2), they shall be disclosed, but not copied, when a person seeks to compare
that signature with a signature on a petition. 
Gevercer Decl., Ex. A, p. 15.
            The
court agreed with the Committee that because Elections Code section 2194(c)(1) allows
the signature’s release as necessary to adjudicate a signature challenge, this
review must be co-extensive with Registrar’s sample review of voter
signatures.  Gevercer Decl., Ex. A, p.
15.  The Committee could therefore review
all signatures on file.  Gevercer Decl.,
Ex. A, p. 15; Flores Decl., ¶22.
            As
for Request No. 3, the Registrar had made electronic notations in the DIMS
voter files identifying who signed the Recall Petition, whether the signature
was accepted or rejected, and the reasons why. 
Gevercer Decl., Ex. A, p. 19.  The
court agreed with the Committee that those notations and lists were memoranda
subject to disclosure under then-Govt. Code section 6253.5.  Gevercer Decl., Ex. A, p. 19.  The question then became whether the
Registrar must provide such lists in electronic form.  Gevercer Decl., Ex. A, p. 20.  
            Then-Govt.
Code section 6253.9(a) required that any agency with information constituting
an identifiable public record not exempt from disclosure that is in an
electronic format shall make that information available in an electronic format
when requested by any person.  Gevercer
Decl., Ex. A, p. 20.  Although the
Registrar was concerned that use of an electronic copy outside the examination
room would make a record public, this could be addressed with a protective
order limiting the lists’ use.  Gevercer
Decl., Ex. A, p. 20.  
            The
court held the Committee had demonstrated a probability of success on the
argument that the Registrar must produce electronic copies of the existing
lists subject to a strict protective order. 
Gevercer Decl., Ex. A, p. 20.  It
must also produce a physical copy of the list of valid signatures, but not an
electronic copy.  Gevercer Decl., Ex. A,
p. 20.  
            The
court then held that it saw no reason why the Committee cannot use electronic
devices in the examination room with a protective order.  Gevercer Decl., Ex. A, p. 22.  It did not set specific access requirements,
but it did order that the parties meet and confer regularly to finish the
examination by March 31, 2023.  Gevercer
Decl., Ex. A, p. 22. This section did not cite to statute.  Gevercer Decl., Ex. A, p. 22.   
            As
to balance of harms, the Committee did not expect to finish its review of the
Recall Petition until May 2024 without injunctive relief.  Gevercer Decl., Ex. A, p. 23.  Because this is only six months before the
end of Gascón’s term, that long a delay would almost deprive the Recall
Petition of its purpose.  Gevercer Decl.,
Ex. A, p. 23.  
            On
January 5, 2023, the Registrar offered to provide the electronic lists of
disqualified signatures in the examination room.  Flores Decl., ¶22; Gevercer Decl., Ex.
B.  However, the Committee wanted to
remove these lists from the examination room. 
Flores Decl., ¶22.
            After
the decision in Recall Gascon, supra, 94 Cal. App. 5th at 371,
the Registrar again offered to make the electronic lists of disqualified
signatures available in the examination room. 
Flores Decl., ¶22.  The Committee
did not review them until October 2023, when it only looked at them for a few
days before it moved on.  Flores Decl.,
¶22. 
            From
April to June 2023, the Committee received monetary contributions of $330,010.  Gevercer Decl., Ex. D.
 
            c.
Costs
            After
reviewing EGC and Cady’s billing statements (Pet. Exs. 34, 36), the Registrar
has identified and analyzed the $13,354.86 in claimed costs.  Kaminski Decl., ¶¶ 3-5, Ex. A.  Assuming arguendo the Committee had
filed a timely memorandum of costs, only $2,110.42 in costs were allowable
under CCP section 1033.5.  Kaminski
Decl., ¶10.
            Costs
that are expressly not allowable include (1) $1,186.73 in photocopying,
postage, and telephone costs, under CCP section 1033.5(b)(3); (2) $1,198.99 for
a transcript not ordered by the court, under CCP section 1033.5(b)(5); and (3) $5,001.28
for computer online research and investigation, including Westlaw and PACER
charges, under CCP section 1033.5(b)(2). 
Kaminski Decl., ¶7.
            Other
costs are not allowable because the Committee has not shown they were
reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation.  Kaminski Decl., ¶8.  These include: (1) $111.02 in parking costs
under CCP section 1033.5(c)(2); (2) $1,073.44 in delivery costs to the Court;
(3) $51.25 in fees paid to the State Bar for pro hac vice admission for an
attorney for the Committee, when local counsel was already part of the case;
(4) $2,199.72 for three items that have no description; (5) $135.71 in filing
fees predating the action; and (6) $1,458.70 in e-filing fees.  Kaminski Decl., ¶8.  
            Some
delivery costs to the court were on dates when no case documents were filed.  Kaminski Decl., ¶8b.  Some were for papers for which courtesy
copies are required under the court’s standing order and the Local Rules.  Kaminski Decl., ¶8b.  Others were for Committee II.  Kaminski Decl., ¶8b.  At best, $567.44 of these costs may have been
allowable.  Kaminski Decl., ¶8b.  
            EGC
asserts e-filing fees with a $150 difference when the documents were of the
same type.  Kaminski Decl., ¶8f.  Some filings were withdrawn, and others
coincide more with the date for filings in Committee II than in this
case.  Kaminski Decl., ¶8f.  The Committee must also bear its own cost for
filing a notice of election on appeal.  Kaminski
Decl., ¶8f.  At best, $1,117.95 in
e-filing costs may have been allowable.  Kaminski
Decl., ¶8f.  
            The
Committee asserts service charges of $512.99 for Logan and $425.03 for the
Registrar in general.  Kaminski Decl.,
¶9.  It fails to explain why service
charges for the same document on the same date for two parties at the same
address are different.  Kaminski Decl., ¶9.  It does not even explain why two service charges
for the same address are reasonably necessary. 
Kaminski Decl., ¶9.
 
            3.
Reply Evidence
            a.
Course of Proceedings
            On
December 22, 2022, the Committee sent the Registrar a letter pursuant to the meet
and confer process the court had ordered when it granted a preliminary
injunction.  Carroll Supp. Decl., ¶4, Ex.
38.  This included the finality of the
decision without the judge’s signature and whether the Committee needed to post
a bond.  Carroll Supp. Decl., ¶4, Ex.
38.  The Committee argued that the court
did not order a bond or for the parties to meet and confer over a bond.  Carroll Supp. Decl., ¶4, Ex. 38.  The Registrar never asked for one in its briefing
on the application for a preliminary injunction.  Carroll Supp. Decl., ¶4, Ex. 38.  The Committee saw no basis to reopen or
reconsider the issue of a bond.  Carroll
Supp. Decl., ¶4, Ex. 38.  
 
            b.
Costs
            The
$5,001.28 in legal research costs were necessary to formulate legal arguments
and effectively pursue litigation.  Carroll
Supp. Decl., ¶5.  Some of these costs were
to obtain court orders when counsel did not receive a mailed copy.   Carroll
Supp. Decl., ¶5.  
            The
$111.02 in travel expenses, including parking in downtown Los Angeles, were
necessary to effectively present the Committee’s argument to the court.  Carroll Supp. Decl., ¶5. 
            The
Committee was required to serve both Defendants with the Petition and Summons
to effectuate proper service.  Carroll
Supp. Decl., ¶5.  The $512.99 in service
charges for Logan and $425.03 in service charges for the Registrar were
therefore both reasonably necessary.  Carroll
Supp. Decl., ¶5.   
            The
$135.71 in messenger fees on September 21, 2022 was to deliver a letter to Registrar
in an attempt to resolve items ultimately litigated in this action.  Carroll Supp. Decl., ¶5.  
            The
Committee paid the $51.25 pro hac vice fee on October 24, 2022 because the
out-of-state counsel’s familiarity with the case made its involvement
necessary.  Carroll Supp. Decl., ¶5.
            On
July 12, 2023, the Committee incurred $26 in delivery fees for a courtesy copy
of the Notice of Related Case for Committee II.  Carroll Supp. Decl., ¶5.  The Committee needed to timely apprise the
court of this in a time-sensitive case.  Carroll
Supp. Decl., ¶5.  
            On
October 9, 2023, the Committee incurred $82.25 in delivery fees for a courtesy
copy of the Status Report so the court had time to review it before the next
day’s Status Conference.  Carroll Supp.
Decl., ¶5.  
            The
$76.20 e-filing fee for an ex parte application on August 16, 2023, was
reasonably necessary at the time.  Carroll
Supp. Decl., ¶5.  It was subsequently
withdrawn after a subsequent court order mooted the requested relief.  Carroll Supp. Decl., ¶5.  The $10.20 e-filing fee for the next day’s Notice
of Withdrawal of the application therefore was reasonably necessary.  Carroll Supp. Decl., ¶5.  
            The
Registrar’s only challenge to $567.44 in delivery and messenger charges and $1,117.95
in e-filing charges is the absence of a memorandum of costs.  Carroll Supp. Decl., ¶5.  When combined with the above items, costs
total $8,117.32.  Carroll Supp. Decl.,
¶5.  The Committee withdraws its request
to recover any other costs.  Carroll
Supp. Decl., ¶5.  
 
            D. Analysis
            The
Committee seeks an award of $1,196,102.50 in attorney’s fees and $8,117.32 in
costs.
 
            1.
Entitlement to Attorney’s Fees
            a.
CPRA
            The
Committee asserts this action compelled the Registrar to expand the Committee’s
physical access to the Recall Petition, permit the use of electronic devices in
the examination room, produce historic voter signatures, produce five
electronic lists, and disclose a physical list of valid signatures.  Mot. at 15.
The general rule regarding a request for attorney’s fees
under the CPRA is that the plaintiff prevails within the meaning of the statute
“when he or she files an action which results in defendant releasing a copy of
a previously withheld document.”  Belth
v. Garamendi, supra, 232 Cal. App. 3d at 898.  Cases denying attorney’s fees to a plaintiff
under the CPRA have done so because “litigation did not cause the [agency] to
disclose any of the documents ultimately made available…”  Motorola Communication & Electronics,
Inc. v. Department of General Services, supra, 55 Cal. App. 4th at
1351.  
 
            (1).
Application of the CPRA
During the December 6, 2022 OSC hearing, this court stated
that, aside from the requested notifications and manuals, this was not a CPRA
case.  Carroll Decl., ¶5, Ex. 17, p.
38.  However, it seemed that the
Committee should have electronic files solely as a matter of convenience.  Ex. 17, p. 38.  
This court granted the preliminary injunction in part.  Carroll Decl., ¶5, Ex. 16. 
For Request No. 1, the Registrar was ordered
to allow the Committee to review all prior signatures of voters whose signatures were denied because of a
mismatch.  Carroll Decl., ¶5, Ex.
16.  It also ordered the production of a hard
copy list of valid signatures but did not require an electronic copy.  Gevercer Decl., Ex. A, p. 20; Carroll Decl.,
¶5, Ex. 16.  The court expressly stated
that it could not grant Request No. 1 under the CPRA because it permits only
inspection of the recall petition and the memoranda prepared by county election
officials.  Gevercer Decl., Ex. A, p. 15.  Instead, the court granted this relief under Elections
Code section 2194, which identifies this information as confidential but
requires its disclosure when a person seeks to compare that signature with a
signature on a petition.  Gevercer Decl.,
Ex. A, p. 15.[5]  
For Request No.
3, the Registrar was required to
produce electronic copies of the existing lists subject to a protective
order to be negotiated by the parties, as well as a hard copy list of valid
signatures for the petition.  Carroll
Decl., ¶5, Ex. 16.  The court did not
rely on the CPRA or any other law to justify this decision.  Gevercer Decl., Ex. A, p. 22.  Instead, it relied on equity and convenience
to expedite the Recall Petition’s review process rather than the CPRA.  Ex. A, pp. 38, 45-46.
When the Registrar appealed the court’s December 2022
preliminary injunction and January 30, 2023 order, the Committee moved to
dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. 
Recall Gascon, supra, 94 Cal. App. 5th at 358.  The appellate court applied section 7923.500,
which requires a party to appeal an order in a CPRA case by petition for
issuance of an extraordinary writ within 40 days.  Id. at 367, 371. Because the
Registrar’s appeal was untimely for the December 2022 preliminary injunction,
the appellate court lacked jurisdiction to consider its merits.  Id.
            Based
on the appellate court decision, the Committee asserts that all this court’s
orders arose under the CPRA even if they did not concern public records.  To argue otherwise would create procedural
disharmony when the appellate court sought to harmonize examination
procedures.  Recall Gascon, supra,
94 Cal. App. 5th at 371.  Reply at 7.
            On
appeal, the Registrar argued the CPRA jurisdictional limit in section
7923.500(a) did not apply to its appeal; the trial court did not order
disclosure of public records because they are excluded under section 7924.110(a)(2).  Recall Gascon, supra, 94 Cal.
App. 5th at 366-67.  The appellate court
held that the policy reasons for expedited appellate review of orders related
to the production of public records – namely, the limited opportunity to
examine an unsuccessful petition and the scope of access to materials subject
to disclosure -- also applied to orders under section 7924.110(b)(2).  Id. at 368-70.  It therefore harmonized the examination
procedures within the CPRA by construing section 7923.500 to cover a trial
court order connected to the examination of an unsuccessful recall petition as
permitted under section 7924.110(b)(2).  Id.
at 370.
            The
appellate court’s harmonization of access under section 7924.110(b)(2) and the
right to review under section 7924.500 is not dispositive.  The appellate court held that the trial court
granted Request Nos. 1 and 3 based on section 7924.110(b)(2) and that provision
must be harmonized with section 7923.500. 
Recall Gascon, supra, 94 Cal. App. 5th at 362.  The appellate court never decided that the trial
court’s orders were for access to CPRA records, and they are not public records
under section 7924.110(a)(2).  
 
            (2).
Applicability to Non-Public Records
            The
Registrar asserts that the production of non-public records pursuant to section
7924.110(a)(2) does not entitle the Committee to attorney’s fees under section
7923.115, which provides that “[f]f the requester prevails in litigation filed
pursuant to this chapter, the court shall award costs and reasonable attorney’s
fees to the requester.”  The Registrar cites
LA Times v. Alameda Corridor Transp. Auth., (“LA Times”) (2001)
88 Cal.App.4th 1381, 1391 (if a public record is disclosed because a plaintiff
filed a suit to obtain it, the plaintiff is the prevailing party).  Opp. at 4-5.
LA Times is not on point.  It does not limit a prevailing plaintiff to
the circumstance where a public record is disclosed and, in fact, references
the broader rule that an action need only motivate the defendants to produce previously
withheld documents.  Id. at 1391.  To hold otherwise would also ignore the
policy analysis of Recall Gascon which sought to harmonize the
interpretation of CPRA review procedures for orders based on the disclosure of public
and non-public records.  94 Cal. App. 5th
at 368, 370.  Because fee-shifting makes CPRA
litigation feasible, the standard should be the same for orders disclosing both
public and non-public records.
            The
court-ordered production of non-public records can justify an award of attorney’s
fees under section 7923.115.  
 
            (3).
Minimal Production/Apportionment
            Circumstances
may arise under which a plaintiff obtains documents as a result of a lawsuit
that are so minimal or insignificant as to justify a finding that the plaintiff
did not prevail.  LA Times, supra,
88 Cal.App.4th at 1391-92.  
            The
Committee asserts that the Registrar cannot argue that the ordered production
was insignificant because Recall Gascon expressly found that all this
court’s orders were made under the CPRA. 
Additionally, the Registrar demanded a high preliminary injunction bond
and then appealed all this court’s orders, thereby demonstrating the
significance of production.  Reply at
7.  
The Registrar argues that the Committee obtained very few of
the documents requested in the FAC.  The
Registrar cites Community Youth Athletic Center v. City of National City (“CYAC”),
(2013) 220 Cal. App. 4th 1385, 1447, n. 29. 
In that case, the plaintiff had received a number of documents from the city
without the necessity of declaratory relief. 
The appellate court advised the trial court to focus on the amount of
effort reasonably related to the limited scope of the CPRA declaratory relief
that was granted and the relationship of the relief to other orders.  Id. at 1447, n. 29.  Opp. at 5-6.
            The
Committee replies that no apportionment is necessary because all forms of
relief granted in this action arose under the CPRA.  Reply at 7-8. 

The Committee is incorrect. 
The Committee ultimately failed on the new issues addressed in the court’s
January 2022 order and only prevailed on Request Nos. 1 and 3 of the five Requests
addressed in the court’s December 6, 2022 ruling.  See Opp. at 2.  For
Request No. 1, the Registrar was ordered to allow
the Committee to review all prior
signatures on file for voters whose signatures were denied because of a
mismatch.  Carroll Decl., ¶5, Ex.
16. For Request No. 3, the Registrar
was ordered to produce three electronic copies of lists the Registrar already
provided in physical form, and a physical copy of one new list.  Carroll Decl., ¶5, Ex. 16.  The Registrar asserts that the Committee
consulted these lists for only a few days before moving on.  Flores Decl., ¶22.[6]  
            
 
            (4).
Conclusion
            This
case was about access to and review of Registrar voter information.  No final judgment was entered, and the case ultimately
was dismissed as moot.  The Committee is a
prevailing party under the CPRA and is entitled to attorney’s fees under
section 7923.115, but only for the fees incurred in obtaining access to such records
and not any fees incurred in obtaining the means to review the information or
in performing the inspection of records. 
The Committee also is not entitled to any fees incurred in connection
with the reversed portions of the January 2023 order.  Even the fees incurred in obtaining access
through the December 6, 2022 preliminary injunction must be apportioned to the
two Requests on which the Committee prevailed. 

 
            b.
Section 1021.5
            (1). Successful Party
            Courts take a “broad, pragmatic view of what constitutes a
‘successful party’” in order to effectuate the policy underlying section
1021.5.  Graham v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., supra, 34 Cal.4th
at 565.  A successful party under section 1021.5 is the party that
succeeds on “any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the
benefit the parties sought in bringing suit.”  Maria P. v. Riles, supra,
43 Cal.3d at 1292.
            The
“catalyst theory” permits an award of attorneys’ fees even when the litigation
does not result in a judicial resolution if the defendant changes its behavior
substantially because of, and in the manner sought by, the litigation.  A
plaintiff must establish that (1) the lawsuit was a catalyst motivating the
defendants to provide the primary relief sought; (2) the lawsuit had merit and
achieved its catalytic effect by threat of victory, not by dint of nuisance and
threat of expense; and (3) the plaintiffs reasonably attempted to settle the
litigation prior to filing the lawsuit. Tipton-Whittingham v. City of Los
Angeles, (2004), 34 Cal. 4th 604, 608. 
            The
Committee argues that it is a successful party because the preliminary
injunction significantly expanded the Committee’s physical access to the Recall Petition,
allowed it to use electronic devices in the examination room, and compelled the
production of various lists and historic signatures.  Mot. at 17.
            The
Registrar asserts that this relief is minimal because the court also denied the
preliminary injunction in part.  Of the 13
remedies sought in the FAP, three were denied, one was reversed on appeal, one
requested a document that did not exist, and four were never pursued.  Opp. at 2. 
The Registrar compromised on the final request, which was the right to
have more Committee representatives in the examination room.  Flores Decl., ¶21.  The Committee still rarely had more
representatives than the Registrar had allowed to begin with.  Flores Decl., ¶21, Ex. A.  Opp. at 7. 

            The
Committee responds that the Registrar improperly narrows the Committee’s goal
to specific forms of relief.  Its litigation
goal was to review the Recall Petition in a timely manner.  The increased access and additional documents
obtained partly helped achieve that goal. 
Reply at 8.
Although
the Committee’s degree of success was not high, it achieved some of the benefit
it sought in bringing suit.  The
Committee was a successful party under section 1021.5.
 
            (2). Enforcement
of an Important Right Affecting the Public Interest 
            The
first prong of the section 1021.5 test — whether a petitioner’s action has
resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest
— requires a determination of the strength or societal importance of the right
involved.  Roybal v. Governing Bd. of
Salinas City Elementary School Dist., (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 1143,
1148.  The right, whether constitutional
or statutory, must be an important right affecting the public interest, not
something involving trivial or peripheral public policies.  Ibid. 
The societal importance of a right generally is determined by
realistically assessing the significance of that right in terms of its
relationship to the achievement of fundamental legislative goals.  Robinson v. City of Chowchilla, (2011)
202 Cal.App.4th 382, 394.  
            The
Committee argues it has vindicated the constitutional right to recall elected
officials and the statutory rights that are a part of that process.  Cal. Const. Art. II §§ 13-19.  The ability to examine a recall petition that
the Registrar has deemed insufficient also increases accountability and public
confidence in government functioning. 
Mot. at 18.  The right to examine
such petitions includes the right to do so promptly.  See Recall Gascon, supra,
94 Cal. App. 5th at 369.  Reply at 9.
The Registrar argues that the Committee cannot argue that a
right was vindicated by the preliminary injunction.  The court granted relief based on equity and
convenience rather than any right under the CPRA.  Further, because the case was dismissed as
moot before any final adjudication, any relief was limited to this particular
action.  Opp. at 8.
            The
Committee replies that the Registrar focuses on the rationale underlying the
benefit obtained and not the effect.  See
Choi v. Orange Cnty. Great Park Corp., (2009) 175 Cal. App. 4th 524,
531 (courts should generally realistically assess the significance of that
right in terms of its relationship to the achievement of fundamental
legislative goals).  Because the
Committee was able to obtain documents and expedite the review process, whether
it did so through a preliminary injunction or a final judgment is irrelevant.  Reply at 10.
             Public access to registrar records is an
important right affecting the public interest. 

 
(3). Significant Benefit Conferred on the General
Public
            The
second prong of the section 1021.5 test is whether plaintiff’s action has
conferred a significant benefit, whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary, on the
general public or a large class of persons. 
The trial court must determine the significance of the benefit and the
size of the group favorably impacted by making a realistic assessment, in light
of all the circumstances, of the gains which have resulted in a particular
case.  Bui v. Nguyen, (2014) 230
Cal.App.4th 1357, 1366.
            The
Committee asserts that this action has helped protect statutory examination
rights that are a crucial part of the constitutional right to petition for the
recall of elected officers.  This in turn
forms a check on the arbitrary exercise of government power.  This action also had a more tangible benefit
insofar as the Committee has now identified thousands of voters whose
signatures on the Recall Petition were wrongly rejected.  The injunctive relief allowed the Committee
to timely file suit against the Registrar to hold it accountable for
disenfranchising those voters and finding the Recall Petition insufficient.  Mot. at 19.
            The
court disagrees.  While important right
affecting the public interest is involved, the Committee did not confer a
significant benefit on the public.  Mere
access to Registrar records generally does not by itself confer a significant
benefit and the Committee’s argument about the identification of thousands of
wrongly rejected signatures is an argument that should be made in Committee
II.  This case was mostly about the
means and timing of access to Registrar records and the Committee obtained only
limited relief in the December 2022 preliminary injunction.  This relief concerned prior signatures on file for voters whose signatures were denied because
of a mismatch and the production of three electronic copies of lists the
Registrar already had provided in physical form, along with a physical copy of a
list of valid signatures for the Recall Petition.  This relief aided the Committee’s effort but did
not confer a significant benefit.  
No significant benefit to the public resulted from the
court’s rulings on these issues.[7]  
 
            (4).
Conclusion
            The
Committee is not entitled to attorney’s fees under section 1021.5.  
 
            2.
Costs
Prejudgment costs allowable
under statute shall be claimed and contested in accordance with rules adopted
by the Judicial Council.  CCP §1034(a).  Thus, any notice of motion
to strike or to tax costs shall be served and filed 15 days after service of the
cost memorandum; if the cost memorandum was served by mail, the period is
extended as provided in CCP section 1013.  CRC 3.1700(b)(1).  These
time limitations, however, are not jurisdictional, and a trial court has broad
discretion in allowing relief from a late filing where there is absence of a
showing of prejudice by the opposing party.  Hoover Community Hotel
Development Corp. v. Thomson, (1995) 168 Cal.App.3d 485.  Also, CRC
3.1700(b)(3) allows the parties to agree to extend the time for serving and
filing the cost memorandum and a motion to strike or tax costs. 
CCP section 1032 defines the
term “prevailing party” as the party with a net monetary recovery, a defendant
in whose favor a dismissal is entered, or a defendant who avoids all
liability.  Great Western Bank v. Converse Consultants, Inc.,
(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 609, 612; Childers v. Edwards, (1996) 48
Cal.App.4th 1544, 1548; Coltrain v. Shewalter, (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 94,
101-02.  CCP section 1032(a)(4) provides that when any party recovers
other than monetary relief, the prevailing party shall be as determined by the
court, and under those circumstances, the court in its discretion may allow
costs or not.  Building Maintenance Services Co. v. AIL Systems, Inc.,
(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1014, 1025. 
            The Committee asserts $8,117.32 in
costs.  Carroll Supp. Decl., ¶5.  The Registrar concedes that $2,110.42 in
costs would be allowable under CCP section 1033.5 but asserts that the rest
either are disallowed as a matter of law, are disallowed for failure to
demonstrate they were reasonably necessary, or reveal unexplained discrepancies
in the amounts charged for the same service. 
Kaminski Decl., ¶¶ 7-9.
            The court need not discuss costs in
detail.  A prevailing party who claims
costs must serve and file a memorandum of costs within 15 days after the date
of mailing of the notice of entry of judgment or dismissal by the clerk under CCP
section 664.5, 15 days after the date of service of written notice of entry of
judgment or dismissal, or within 180 days after entry of judgment, whichever is
first.  CRC 3.1700(a)(1); Hydratec,
Inc. Sun Valley 260 Orchard & Viineyard Co., (1990) 223
Cal.App.3d 924, 928-29.    The Committee failed to file a memorandum of
costs.  Opp. at 15.  As a result, it is not entitled to them.
            The Committee cites Kaufman v.
Diskeeper Corp., (“Kaufman”) (2014) 229 Cal. App. 4th 1, 6, to
assert that a party seeking attorney’s fees need not separately file a
memorandum of costs.  Reply at 15.  This is incorrect.  Kaufman held that a party moving for
attorney’s fees under Civil Code section 1717 need not file a memorandum of
costs.  Id. at 6.  It said nothing about relieving a party from
filing a timely cost memorandum for other costs when a timely attorney’s fee
motion is filed.  
The Committee did not file a
timely cost memorandum and was required to do so.  In any event, the appellate court ordered
each side to bear its own costs and the court does the same.  See CCP §1032(a)(4); Building
Maintenance Services Co. v. AIL Systems, Inc., supra, 55 Cal.App.4th
at 1025. 
 
            E. Conclusion
            The motion is granted in part for attorney’s
fees and denied as to costs.  The parties
are directed to file new papers for a hearing on the reasonableness of CPRA fees
and must meet and confer before they do so.
