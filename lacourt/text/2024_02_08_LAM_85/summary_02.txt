And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Registrar has requested that the court rule on the Committee's entitlement to fees. The Registrar has provided additional resources to expedite the review, including almost tripling the number of Committee representatives in the examination room and providing lists that it does not normally create. The Registrar has also responded to 21 CPRA requests beyond the scope of this litigation and diverted $1.3 million in resources to the Recall Petition review. However, the court finds that the Registrar's effort does not significantly bear on the Committee's entitlement to fees. The court also notes that it need not rule on the Committee's evidentiary objections as they have no bearing on the outcome of this motion.
