```
Case Number: 23STCV28792
Hearing Date: February 8, 2024
Dept: 85
Judge's Tentative Ruling:

**Facts:**

* The plaintiff (Tenant) is seeking a preliminary injunction to enjoin the defendant (Landlord) from collecting rent during the pendency of the action.
* The dispute arises from the condition of the rental property, which is infested with mold and has structural defects.
* Tenant has presented evidence of harm caused by the mold, including medical reports and test results.
* Landlord has presented evidence that Tenant caused some of the mold by leaving his washing machine unattended and flooding the floor.

**Analysis:**

* The court finds that Tenant has not demonstrated a probability of success on the merits, as the evidence suggests that Tenant caused some of the mold and that Landlord has addressed the issue by removing the mold.
* The court also finds that the balance of hardships disfavors granting the preliminary injunction, as Landlord would be deprived of a source of income
