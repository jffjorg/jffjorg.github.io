And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses several issues related to a court hearing. First, the judge notes that the landlord has requested judicial notice of various documents filed in the case, but the court does not need to grant this request because it can review the documents on its own. Second, the judge discusses the nature of an injunction, explaining that a mandatory injunction requires a heavy burden of proof and is typically only granted in extreme cases. However, the court may issue an injunction to maintain the status quo without a cause of action in the complaint. Third, the judge addresses disputes over the accuracy of documents and the interpretation of a minute order. The judge finds that the tenant miscategorizes eviction notices and that the landlord misreads the minute order. The judge's ruling is a tentative ruling, meaning it is subject to change or revision before the final ruling is made.
