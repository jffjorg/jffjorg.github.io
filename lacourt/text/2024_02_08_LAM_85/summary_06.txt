```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a petition for administrative mandamus filed by NCD, which challenges the City's rejection of its builder's remedy project. The City argues that NCD failed to summarize both favorable and unfavorable evidence on the sufficiency of the evidence to support the City's findings, and that NCD's claims are waived. The court finds that NCD's claims lack merit and its bad faith argument may be waived. The court also declines to judicially notice a separate HCD memorandum and concludes that the City Council was the final decision-maker and had authority to make HAA findings. The court will not order the City to approve the project, as a mandamus judgment will not lie to control a public agency's discretion.
