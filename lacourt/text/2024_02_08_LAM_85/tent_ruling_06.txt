The minutes of the February 7, 2023
City Council meeting summarize the appeal hearing.  AR 1189-91. 
The minutes mention a discussion of the Department Director’s
responsibility to assess whether the Project is a builder’s remedy project and,
if so, accept and process the application. 
AR 1191.  NCD cites the
minutes as demonstrating that the Department Director was not vested with the
authority to adopt the findings necessary for rejecting a project under the HAA
and the builder’s remedy.  Pet. Op. Br.
at 10.  It is not clear how the minutes
demonstrate this conclusion.  In any
event, it is undisputed that the City Council was the final decision-maker and that
it had authority to make HAA findings.


[3]
Although NCD seeks various forms of declaratory relief – the Department
Director violated section 65589.5(d) when she chose not to process the formal application
and approve the Project, the City Council violated section 65589.5(d) when it
did not grant NCD’s appeal, the Department Director and City Council’s
rejection of the application was arbitrary and capricious, and the City
Council’s denial of the appeal had no rational basis – these claims are
subsumed within the Petition’s administrative mandamus claim.


[4] NCD notes
that the roots of the builder’s remedy lie in the 1990 amendments to the
HAA.  See, e.g., Stats.1990, c.
1439 (SB 2011), §1.  The Legislature intended that the remedy be
used to mandate approvals of affordable housing development projects even if
they were inconsistent with the local jurisdiction’s zoning documents.  See, e.g., Assem. Com. on Local
Governments Rep. on SB 2011
(1989-1990 Reg. Sess.), Aug. 6, 1990 (“This bill . . . prohibits local
governments from denying 20% ‘affordable’ projects even if they are
inconsistent with the General Plan and zoning . . .”). NCD RJN Ex. 1.  Pet.
Op. Br. at 13-14, n. 5.
 


[5] The City notes that the party who challenges the
sufficiency of the evidence to support a particular finding must summarize both favorable and unfavorable evidence
on that point and show how and why it
is insufficient.   Schmidlin v. City of Palo Alto,
(2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 728, 738, Where a party presents only facts and
inferences favorable to his or her position, any contention that the decision
is not supported by substantial evidence is waived.  Id. 
The City argues that NCD failed to abide by this requirement by misleadingly
characterizing the Resolution as a “Denial Resolution”, intimating that the Project
was denied, and wrongly asserting that the Resolution contains “no evidence.”  NCD fails to address the evidence in the
Resolution (AR 1174-76), the staff report (AR 725-30), and the Department
Director’s December 2, 2022 letter stating that the application was incomplete.  AR 838-41. 
Opp. at 11-12.
The mischaracterization of evidence is not a failure
to cite that evidence.  Additionally,
NCD’s failure to discuss the evidence in the Resolution, staff report, and
Department Director letter is not a ground on which the court will find a
waiver.


[6]
The court has declined to
judicially notice a separate HCD memorandum opining that a housing
element is in compliance with the Housing Element Law only after HCD certifies
it.  NCD RJN Ex. 2.  Therefore, the court need not consider the
City’s arguments that HCD’s statutory interpretation is in error.  Opp. at 14.


[7]
This conclusion is supported by other parts of the Housing Element Law devising
a rezoning deadline penalty for late housing element adoption.  For an adopted housing element to be timely,
sections 65583(c)(1)(A), 65583.2(c), and 65588(e)(4)(C)(i) require that a
city’s housing element be found by HCD to be in
substantial compliance with the Housing Element Law.  Without such a finding, the city must
complete rezoning within a year from the statutory deadline.  §§ 65583(c)(1)(A)), §65583.2(c), 65588(e)(4)(C)(i).  Additionally, the city’s housing element
cannot be found to be in substantial compliance until it has completed the
rezoning.  §65588(e)(4)(C)(iii).  It would not make sense to require HCD
approval of a housing element’s substantial compliance to avoid late penalties
but not for substantial compliance generally.


[8]
The State Housing Law also states: “New housing developments constructed within
the coastal zone shall, where feasible, provide housing units for person and
families of low or moderate income….”  §65590(d).  


[9] As the City argues, the language of section 65589.5(e) has not changed since Kalnel, even as other provisions
of the HAA were strengthened to support housing development.  Opp. at 16-18.


[10] Finally, NCD
argues that the City rejected NCD's Project in bad faith and the HAA authorizes
the court to order the City in the first instance to approve the Project.  §65589.5(k)(1)(A)(ii).  Evidence of the City's bad faith includes (a)
its summary repudiation of NCD's builder's remedy right; (b) its self-declared,
legally unsupported exemption of the City's coastal areas from the housing
laws; (c) attempting to disguise a denial of a builder's remedy project as a
notice of incomplete application; (d) failing to acknowledge its burden of proof
under the HAA; and (e) flouting the fact that the Housing Element was not in
compliance at the time of preliminary application submittal.  Reply at 11.
Aside from the facts that NCD’s
claims lack merit and that its bad faith argument may be waived as raised for
the first time in reply (see Regency
Outdoor Advertising v. Carolina Lances, Inc., (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1323, 1333), the City is correct that NCD could
not be entitled to a writ ordering the City to approve the Project.  Opp. at 18-19.  A mandamus judgment “will not lie to control
a public agency’s discretion, that is to say, force the exercise of discretion
in a particular manner.”  County of Los Angeles v. City of Los Angeles,
(2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 643, 654.
