 Case Number:  23STCP00426    Hearing Date:   February 8, 2024    Dept:  85 
New Commune DTLA LLC
vs. City of Redondo Beach et al, 23STCP00426


Tentative decision on petition
for writ of mandate:   denied



 
            
Petitioner New Commune DTLA LLC (“NCD”) seeks a writ of
mandate compelling Respondents City of Redondo Beach, its City Council, and its
Department of Community Development (“Department”), (collectively, “City”) to process
its application for a Project at 1021 N. Harbor Drive (“Property”), approve the
Project, and issue all related and necessary permits.
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply, and
renders the following tentative decision. 
 
A. Statement of
the Case
            1. Petition
            Petitioner
NCD commenced this action on February 14, 2023, alleging (1) mandamus based on
the Housing Accountability Act (“HAA”), (2) administrative or traditional
mandamus based on the Permit Streamlining Act, and (3) declaratory relief.  The verified Petition alleges in pertinent
part as follows.
            On
July 21, 2022, NCD submitted a preliminary application for the Project at the
Propertym on which is located the SEA Lab educational facility, a vacant and
underutilized site in the City’s coastal zone. 
The Project is for construction of 35 housing units, six of which are
set aside for lower income households as defined in Government Code[1]
section 65589.5(h)(3).  
            At
the time of the preliminary application, the City did not have a revised
housing element that was in substantial compliance with the Housing Element
Law.  Because the City’s housing element
was not yet in compliance, the State Department of Housing and Community
Development (“HCD”) had not certified it.
            On
November 10, 2022, NCD timely submitted its formal application for the Project.  On December 7, 2022, the Department sent a
rejection notice informing NCD that the City would not accept or process the
application.  The Department asserted that
the Project was within the “Coastal Commercial” land use designation and the “CC-4”
(Coastal Commercial) zoning district, and neither the zoning nor the land use
designation permitted residential uses.  
            The
rejection notice also asserted that NCD was not entitled to develop the Project
under section 65589.5(d) because HCD had issued a compliance determination for the
City’s housing element.  This compliance
determination occurred on September 1, 2022, after NCD had submitted its
preliminary application.  The rejection
notice advised NCD to submit permit applications consistent with uses approved
for the CC-4 zone.  Alternatively, it
could submit applications for a general plan amendment, Land Use Plan (“LCP”) amendment,
and zoning amendment to construct residential units on the Property.  
The Department’s decision lacked written findings and was
incorrect as a matter of law.  The
rejection notice, and the refusal to process the formal application, do not qualify
as a valid notice of an incomplete application under section 65943.  The formal application was complete by
operation of law and must be processed to a final decision.  Under the HAA’s builder’s remedy, NCD is
entitled to approval of the Project because the City could not find that its
revised housing element complied with the Housing Element Law.
            NCD
requested an administrative appeal of the Department’s decision to reject the
application.  The City Council heard the
appeal on February 7, 2023, and decided that the Department’s Director acted
within her authority when she rejected the formal Project application.  The City Council passed Resolution No.
CC-2302-023 to that effect, denying the appeal. 
The City Council did not attempt to meet its burden of proof or make the
findings required under the HAA.
            NCD
seeks (1) mandamus voiding the City Council’s appeal decision and compelling
the City to accept and process the formal application, approve the Project, and
issue all necessary Project approvals, (2) a declaration that the Department
Director violated section 65589.5(d) when she chose not to process and accept
the formal application and approve the Project, (3) a declaration that the City
Council violated section 65589.5(d) when it did not grant NCD’s appeal and
directing City staff to process the formal application and approve the Project,
(4) a declaration that the Department Director and City Council’s rejection of
the formal application was arbitrary, capricious, and devoid of merit, (5) a
declaration that the City Council’s denial of the Project had no rational basis,
and (7) attorney’s fees under section 65598.5(k)(1)(A)(ii), CCP sections 1021.5
and 1036, and any other applicable law.  
 
            2. Course of Proceedings
            On
February 17, 2023, NCD served the City with the Petition and Summons by
substitute service, effective February 27, 2023.
            On
April 19, 2023, Respondents filed a joint Answer.
            On
May 30, 2023, the court denied NCD’s request to relate this case to New
Commune DTLA, LLC v. City of Redondo Beach et al, Case No. 23STCV10146.
            On
July 13, 2023, the court denied NCD’s request to relate this case to Wilshire
LLC v. City of Redondo Beach et al., Case No. 23STCP02189.
            On
July 28, 2023, Respondents filed a joint amended Answer.
 
            B. Standard of Review
Agency decisions under the
HAA are reviewed as administrative mandamus.  §65589.5(m); Honchariw v.
County of Stanislaus, (“Honchariw”) (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1066, 1072.  CCP section 1094.5 is the administrative
mandamus provision which structures the procedure for judicial review of
adjudicatory decisions rendered by administrative agencies.  Topanga
Association for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles, (“Topanga”)
(1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 51415.  The pertinent issues under section 1094.5
are (1) whether the respondent has proceeded without jurisdiction, (2) whether
there was a fair trial, and (3) whether there was a prejudicial abuse of
discretion.  CCP §1094.5(b).  An abuse of discretion is established
if the respondent has not proceeded in the manner required by law, the decision
is not supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by the
evidence.  CCP §1094.5(c). 
            CCP
section 1094.5 does not on its face specify which cases are subject to
independent review of evidentiary findings. Fukuda v. City of Angels,
(1999) 20 Cal.4th 805, 811.  Instead, that issue was left to the
courts.  In cases other than those requiring the court to exercise its
independent judgment, the substantial evidence test applies.  CCP
§1094.5(c).  Land use decisions do not typically involve vested rights
requiring independent review.  See PMI Mortgage Insurance Co. v.
City of Pacific Grove, (1981) 128 Cal.App.3d 724, 729.  There is no
vested right in the enforcement of a zoning ordinance.  Hermosa Beach
Stop Oil Coalition v. City of Hermosa Beach, (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 534,
552.   
            “Substantial
evidence” is relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate
to support a conclusion (California Youth Authority v. State Personnel Board,
(2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 575, 585) or evidence of ponderable legal significance,
which is reasonable in nature, credible and of solid value.  Mohilef v. Janovici, (1996) 51
Cal.App.4th 267, 305, n.28.  The trial court considers all evidence in the
administrative record, including evidence that detracts from evidence
supporting the agency’s decision.  California Youth Authority, supra,
104 Cal.App.4th at 585. 
            An agency
is presumed to have regularly performed its official duties (Evid. Code §664),
and the petitioner seeking administrative mandamus therefore has the burden of
proof.  Steele v. Los Angeles County Civil Service Commission,
(1958) 166 Cal.App.2d 129, 137; Afford v. Pierno, (1972) 27 Cal.App.3d
682, 691 (“[T]he burden of proof falls upon the party attacking the
administrative decision to demonstrate wherein the proceedings were unfair, in
excess of jurisdiction or showed prejudicial abuse of discretion).  
            The
agency’s decision at the hearing must be based on the evidence.  Board
of Medical Quality Assurance v. Superior Court, (1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 860,
862.  The decision-maker is only required to issue findings that give
enough explanation so that parties may determine whether, and upon what basis,
to review the decision. Topanga, supra, 11 Cal.3d at 51415. 
Implicit in CCP section 1094.5 is a requirement that the agency set forth
findings to bridge the analytic gap between the raw evidence and ultimate
decision or order.  Id.
 
            C. Judicial Notice
NCD requests judicial notice of (1) an Assembly
Committee on Local Governments Report on SB 2011, dated August 6, 1990 (NCD RJN
Ex. 1); (2) a memorandum on “Summary and Clarification of Requirements for
Housing Element Compliance” prepared by HCD’s Division of Housing Policy
Development, dated March 16, 2023 (NCD RJN Ex. 2); and (3) a Special Bulletin
#3 regarding the state Senate’s Natural Resources and Wildlife Committee Vote
on SB 1579 and SB 1920, dated May 7, 1976 (NCD RJN Ex. 3).
            Exhibit
2 is a March 16, 2023 HCD memorandum
clarifying the HAA requirements for housing element compliance.  NCD RJN Ex. 2.  The memorandum explained that when a local jurisdiction
submits an “adopted” housing element before submitting an initial draft or
considering HCD’s findings on an initial draft,¿HCD will treat the adopted element
as an initial draft.  Ex. 2, p. 1.  The memorandum added that the local jurisdiction
does not have the authority to determine that its adopted element is in
substantial compliance with the HAA; it can only provide reasoning why the HCD
should make such a finding.  Ex. 2, p. 2.  A local jurisdiction is only in compliance as
of the date HCD issues a letter finding the adopted element to be in
substantial compliance.  Ex. 2, p. 2.  
Exhibit 3 is a May 7, 1976 Special Bulletin issued by an
entity called California Research regarding the state Senate’s Natural Resources
and Wildlife Committee Vote on SB 1579 and SB 1920.  NCD RJN Ex. 3. The
report explained that one senator had proposed an amendment to SB 1579 that
would basically provide a percentage of housing for all socioeconomic strata
based on similar percentages of like people throughout the state.  NCD RJN Ex. 3, p. 3.  The goal was to avoid creating, continuing,
or encouraging only the elite to live on the coast.  Id. 
The proposed amendment failed 3-5. 
Id.  One Senator commented that
parts of the idea were not bad, but housing policy should be consistent
statewide with no preference given to areas near the coast.  Id.
 
 
The City objects to all three exhibits on the basis that the
scope of review for administrative mandamus is limited to the administrative
record.  Pet. Op. RJN Obj. at 2-4.  Courts can take judicial notice of exhibits in
administrative mandamus cases to support legal arguments but not to establish
operating facts.  Ochoa v Anaheim City
Sch. Dist. (2017) 11 Cal.App.5th 209, 221; Bonome v City of Riverside,
(2017) 10 Cal.App.5th 14, 20.  Although
neither cited case supports the City’s position, the court agrees with it.  Exhibits 1 and 3 meet this criterion, but Exhibit
2 does not.  
Exhibit is not subject to judicial notice because there is
no authentication other than a declaration stating that it is contained in a
legislative history file. 
Bereczky-Anderson Decl.  Not every
document in a legislative file is subject to judicial notice.  Specifically, there is no indication what
California Research is or why its Special Bulletin #3 is in a legislative
file.  The evidence is insufficient to
conclude that Exhibit 3 bears on legislative intent for any bill.  See Evid. Code §452(b).
            The City also objects that Exhibits 1-3 are not relevant
to the City Council’s February 7, 2023 decision.  Pet. Op. RJN Obj. at 3-4.  The City notes that Exhibits 1 and 3 are dated
1990 and 1976, respectively and Exhibit 2 is dated March 16, 2023, after the
City Council’s February 7, 2023 appeal decision.  Id. 
The dates of these documents are of no particular moment if an exhibit
is otherwise subject to judicial notice. 

The City further objects that Exhibit is not an
official act, also citing Martinez v. City of Clovis, (“Martinez”)
(2023), 90 Cal.App.5th 193, 243, which held that HCD’s informal interpretation
of statutory requirements is not binding on the court.  Pet. Op. RJN Obj. at 4.  Martinez explains that “any deference
that might be due” to HCD's interpretation is overcome by the plain meaning of
the statute at issue.  Id.  The amount of deference due to HCD’s
interpretation has no bearing on whether the interpretation is subject to
judicial notice.  
NCD’s request is granted for NCD RJN Ex. 1 and denied
for NCD RJN Exs. 2 and 3.  See Evid.
Code §452(c). 
            Two
weeks after filing its opposition, the City filed a request for judicial notice
of the trial court’s final ruling in New Commune DTLA, LLC and Leonid
Pustilnikov v. City of Redondo Beach and City Council of the City of Redondo
Beach, (“Pustilnikov”) Case No. 22TRCP00203 (Opp. RJN Ex. 1).  On
October 30, 2023, Department 8 (Hon. Ronald Frank) issued a decision denying
NCD’s petition for a writ of mandate in Pustilnikov.  Opp. RJN Ex. 1.  NCD argued, inter alia, that the City
did not have a compliant housing element until HCD completed its review of on
September 1, 2022.  Opp. RJN Ex. 1,
p.18.  Judge Frank rejected this argument
because the record reflected an interactive process in which HCD periodically
indicated its conditional approval of earlier submittals.  Opp. RJN Ex. 1, p.18.  The City Council’s July 5, 2022 resolution
included all the conditions HCD had previously indicated were required for
formal approval.  Opp. RJN Ex. 1,
p.18.  The City therefore substantially
complied with the Housing Element Law when it adopted the resolution on July 5,
2022.  Opp. RJN Ex. 1, p. 18.  
As NCD points out (Reply at 9-10), written trial court
decisions have no precedential value and therefore are irrelevant for purposes
of judicial notice.  Crab Addison,
Inc. v. Superior Court, (2008) 169 Cal.App.4th 958, 963, n. 3; Santa Ana
Hospital Medical Center v. Belshé (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 819, 831.  The request is denied.
            In
reply, NCD seeks judicial notice of a
December 12, 2023 ex parte application to intervene by the People
of the State of California and HCD in California Housing Defense Fund v.
City of La Cañada Flintridge, Case No. 23STCP02614 (NCD RJN Ex. 4).  There, a city had adopted a revised draft
housing element.  NCD RJN Ex. 4, p. 4.  HCD argued that under the builder’s remedy,
section 65589.5(d)(5), a local agency may disapprove an
affordable housing project that “is inconsistent with both the jurisdiction’s
zoning ordinance and general plan use designation” only if that housing element
is in substantial compliance with the Housing Element Law.  NCD RJN Ex. 4, p.5.  The city did not have a housing element
certified by HCD to be in substantial compliance with the Housing Element Law
when the project application was submitted. 
NCD RJN Ex. 4, p.5.  
            Unlike
the City’s request, NCD does not seek judicial notice of a trial court ruling and
only seeks to demonstrate that HCD’s position on a city’s substantial
compliance with housing element requirements has remained consistent.  Reply at 10. 
Nonetheless, NCD improperly seeks to include an extra-record operative
fact (HCD’s position) in the administrative record, and the request is
denied.  
 
D. Governing
Law
1. The City’s Housing Element
            The Legislature finds
that the provision of housing affordable to low- and moderate-income households
requires the cooperation of all levels of government.  §65580(c).
            At least 90 days prior
to adoption of a revision of its housing element, or 60 days prior to the
adoption of a subsequent amendment thereto, the local jurisdiction agency shall
submit a draft element revision or draft amendment to HCD.  §65585(b)(1). 
In the preparation of review findings, HCD may consult with any public
agency, group, or person and shall receive and consider any written comments
from such entities regarding the draft or adopted element or amendment under
review.  §65585(c).
            HCD shall review the
draft and report its written findings to the planning agency within 90 days of
its receipt of the first draft submittal for each housing element revision, or
60 days of its receipt of a subsequent draft amendment or an adopted revision
or adopted amendment to an element. 
§65585(b)(3).  In its written
findings, the HCD shall determine whether the draft element or draft amendment
substantially complies with the Housing Element Law.  §65585(d). 

            Prior to the adoption of
its draft element or draft amendment, the legislative body shall consider the
findings made by HCD if they become available within the time limits set in
section 65585.  §65585(e).
            If HCD finds that the
draft element or draft amendment does not substantially comply with this
article, the legislative body shall either change the draft element or
amendment to so comply or adopt the draft element or draft amendment without
changes.  §65585(f).  If the legislative body adopts without
changes, it shall include in its resolution of adoption written findings that explain
why the legislative body believes the draft element or draft amendment
substantially complies with the Housing Element Law despite HCD’s
findings.  §65585(f)(2).
 
2. The Housing
Accountability Act 
            a. Legislative
Findings and Intent
The Legislature recognizes
the lack of housing as a critical problem that threatens the economic,
environmental, and social quality of life in California.  §65589.5(a)(1)(A).  It adopted the HAA in 1982 to “significantly
increase the approval and construction of new housing for all economic segments
of California’s communities by meaningfully and effectively curbing the
capability of local governments to deny, reduce the density for, or render
infeasible housing development projects and emergency shelters.”  §65589.5(a)(2)(K).   To date, the goal remains
unfulfilled.  Id.
            The HAA reflects the
Legislature’s findings that “the availability of housing is of vital statewide
importance,” and that providing the necessary housing supply “requires the
cooperative participation of government and the private sector in an effort to
expand housing opportunities and accommodate the housing
needs of Californians of all economic levels.” 
§65580(a)-(b).  
            Effective
January 1, 2018, the Legislature significantly amended the HAA to strengthen
its provisions, expand its applicability, and increase local governments’
liability for violations.  The HAA found that California is in a housing
crisis that is “partially caused by activities and policies of many local governments
that limit the approval of housing, increase the cost of land for housing, and
require that high fees and exactions be paid by producers of housing,” §65589.5(a)(1)(B).
 The consequences of those actions
include discrimination against low-income and minority households, lack of
housing to support employment growth, imbalance in jobs and housing, reduced
mobility, urban sprawl, excessive commuting, and air quality deterioration.  §65589.5(a)(1)(C).
            Many local governments do not give
adequate attention to the economic, environmental, and social costs of
decisions that result in disapproval of housing development projects, reduction
in density of housing projects, and excessive standards for housing development
projects.  §65589.5(a)(1)(D).  The state’s
homeownership rate was at its lowest level since the 1940s and ranked 49 out of
the 50 states.  §65589.5(a)(2)(E). 
The lack of supply and rising costs are compounding inequality and limiting
advancement opportunities for many Californians.  §65589.5(a)(2)(F).
            The HAA should be “interpreted and implemented in a
manner to afford the fullest possible weight to the interest of, and the
approval and provision of, housing.”  §65589.5(a)(2)(L). 
            It
is the intent of the Legislature that the conditions that would have a
specific, adverse impact upon the public health and safety under either section
65589.5(d)(2) and 65589.5(j)(1) arise infrequently.  §65589.5(a)(3).
            It
is the policy of the state that a local government not reject or make
infeasible housing development projects that contribute to meeting the need
determined pursuant to the HAA without a thorough analysis of the economic,
social, and environmental effects of the action and without complying with
section 65589.5(d).  §65589.5(b).
 
            b.
Project Applications
Subject to certain
exceptions, a housing development project shall be subject only to the
ordinances, policies, and standards adopted and in effect when a preliminary
application which included all the information required by section 65941.1(a)
was submitted.  §65589.5(o)(1).  
A housing
development project “shall be deemed consistent, compliant, and in conformity
with an applicable plan, program, policy, ordinance, standard, requirement, or
other similar provision if there is substantial evidence that would allow a
reasonable person to conclude that the housing development project or emergency
shelter is consistent, compliant, or in conformity.” §65589.5(f)(4). 
            Section
65589.5(j)(1) provides: 
 
“When a proposed housing development project complies with
applicable, objective general plan, zoning, and subdivision standards
and criteria, including design review standards, in effect at the time that the
housing development project's application is determined to be complete, but the
local agency proposes to disapprove the project or to impose a condition
that the project be developed at a lower density, the local agency shall
base its decision regarding the proposed housing development project upon written
findings supported by a preponderance of the evidence on the record that both
of the following conditions exist: 
(A) The housing development project would have a specific,
adverse impact upon the public health or safety unless the project is
disapproved or approved upon the condition that the project be developed at a
lower density. As used in this paragraph, a “specific, adverse impact” means a
significant, quantifiable, direct, and unavoidable impact, based on
objective, identified written public health or safety standards, policies, or
conditions as they existed on the date the application was deemed complete. 
(B) There is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate
or avoid the adverse impact identified pursuant to paragraph (1), other than
the disapproval of the housing development project or the approval of the
project upon the condition that it be developed at a lower density.” (emphasis
added). 
 
Section
65589.5(j) applies to market rate housing as well as affordable housing.  Honchariw, supra, 200 Cal.App.4th at 1070.  The HAA applies to all
residential housing developments and takes away the agency’s ability to deny
residential projects based on subjective development policies.  Id.
at 1072-77.     
“Disapprove the housing
development project” includes any instance in which a local agency “votes on a
proposed housing development project application and it is disapproved”, “fails
to comply with the timer periods specified in Section 65950”, or fails to meet
the time limits specified in Section 65913.3. 
§65589.5(h)(6).
If the
court finds that an agency acted in bad faith in disapproving a project in
violation of the HAA, the appropriate remedy is an “order or judgment directing
the local agency to approve the housing development project.”
§65589.5(k)(1)(A)(ii).  “Bad faith” “includes, but is not limited to, an
action that is frivolous or otherwise entirely without merit.”
§65589.5(l).  
            The local jurisdiction bears the burden of proving that its
decision conforms to the conditions specified in section 65589.5. 
§65589.6.   
 
c. The
Builder’s Remedy
            In 1990, the
Assembly Committee on Local Government issued a report on SB 2011, which
amended the HAA to provide for the builder’s remedy.  NCD RJN Ex. 1, pp. 1-2.  The comments explained that there were
concerns that local governments do not always implement their general plan
housing elements or that they are not always adequate to address affordable
housing needs.  NCD RJN Ex. 1, p. 3.  SB 2011 would therefore prohibit local
governments from denying 20% affordable projects even if they are inconsistent
with the general plan and zoning.  NCD
RJN Ex. 1, p. 3.  
A local agency shall not disapprove a housing
development project for very low, low-, or
moderate-income households, or an emergency shelter, or condition approval in a
manner that renders the housing development project infeasible for development
for the use of very low, low- or moderate-income households, including through
the use of design review standards, unless it makes written findings, based
upon a preponderance of the evidence in the record, for one of five  conclusions: 
(1) the local jurisdiction has adopted a housing
element in substantial compliance with the HAA and has met or exceeded its
share of the regional housing need allocation pursuant to section 65584 for the
planning period for the income category proposed for the housing development
project, provided that any disapproval or conditional approval shall not be
based on any of the reasons prohibited by section 65008.  §65589.5(d)(1).
(2) the proposed housing development would have a
specific, adverse impact on the public health or safety that cannot be feasibly
mitigated without rendering the project unaffordable or infeasible.  A specific, adverse impact on public health
or safety does not include inconsistency with the zoning ordinance or general
plan land use designation. 
§65589.5(d)(2)(A); 
(3) denial of the project is required to comply with
specific state or federal law, and there is no feasible method to comply
without rendering the project unaffordable or infeasible; 
(4) the proposed land for the project is zoned for,
and surrounded on at least two sides by, agriculture or resource preservation
purposes;  
(5) the housing development project or emergency
shelter is inconsistent with both the jurisdiction’s zoning ordinance and
general plan land use designation as specified in any element of the general
plan as it existed on the date the application was deemed complete, and the
jurisdiction has adopted a revised housing element in accordance with Section
65588 that is in substantial compliance with the HAA.  §§ 65589.5(d)(1)-(5).  
A “housing development project” includes any
mixed-use development consisting of residential and nonresidential uses with at
least two-thirds of the square footage designated for residential use.  §65589.5(h)(2).  “Housing for very low, low-, or
moderate-income households” includes buildings where 20% of the units are sold
or rented to lower income households. 
§65589.5(h)(3).  
“Deemed complete” means the applicant has submitted a
preliminary application pursuant to section 65941.1 or, if the applicant has
not submitted a preliminary application, has submitted a complete application
pursuant to section 65943.  §65589.5(h)(5).  
“Disapproval of a housing development project”
includes whenever a local agency votes on a proposed housing development
project application and the application is disapproved, including any required
land use approvals or entitlements necessary for the issuance of a building
permit.  §65589.5(h)(6)(A).
A “specific, adverse impact”
is a “significant, quantifiable, direct, and unavoidable impact, based on
objective, identified written public health or safety standards, policies, or
conditions as they existed on the date the application was deemed complete.”
§65589.5(j)(1)(A).  The Legislature’s intent is that conditions that would
have a specific, adverse impact upon the public health and safety should arise
infrequently.  §65589.5(a)(3).   
 
d. Consistency with Other Laws
New housing
developments constructed within the coastal zone shall, where feasible, provide
housing units for persons and families of low or moderate income.  §65590(d). 
Where it is not feasible to provide these housing units in a proposed
new housing development, the local government shall require the developer to
provide such housing, if feasible to do so, at another location within the same
city or county, either within the coastal zone or within three miles thereof.  Id.
Nothing in the HAA relieves
the local agency from complying with, inter alia, the Coastal Act or the
California Environmental Quality Act (“CEQA”).  §65589.5(e).  Nothing in the HAA, aside from section 65589.5(o), shall be
construed to prohibit a local agency from requiring the housing development
project to comply with objective, quantifiable, written development standards,
conditions, and policies appropriate to, and consistent with, meeting the
jurisdiction’s share of the regional housing need.  §65589.5(f)(1).  However, the development standards,
conditions, and policies shall be applied to facilitate and accommodate
development at the density permitted on the site and proposed by the
development.  Id.
 
            3. The Housing Crisis Act
In 2019, the
Legislature enacted the Housing Crisis Act (“HCA”), declaring, despite
the HAA, a temporary housing emergency statewide to preserve existing housing,
enhance protections for occupants, and increase certainty in the development
review process.  See SB 330 §2(b).  
Among other limitations, the HCA
ensures housing production is not stymied by precluding an affected county or
city – including charter cites and the electorate – from either reducing
existing residential intensities or imposing a limitation on housing
development within all or a portion of an affected city without first making a
finding of an “imminent threat” to public health and safety.  §§ 66300(a)(1)(B)(3), (b)(1)(A), (b)(1)(B)(i),
65589.5.  The HCA prohibits an
affected city
 
“…from enacting a development policy, standard, or condition,
as defined, that would have the effect of (A) changing the land use
designation or zoning of a parcel or parcels of property to a less intensive
use or reducing the intensity of land use within an existing zoning district
below what was allowed under the general plan or specific plan land use designation
and zoning ordinances of the county or city as in effect on January 1, 2018….”  §66300(b)(1) (emphasis added).  
   
An “affected county” or “affected city” includes the
electorate of an affected county or city exercising its local initiative or
referendum power, whether that power is derived from the California
Constitution, statute, or the charter or ordinances of the affected county or
city.  §66300(a)(3).  “Reducing the intensity of land use” includes
reductions to height, density, or floor area ratio, new or increased open space
or lot size requirements, new or increased setback requirements, minimum
frontage requirements, or maximum lot coverage limitations, or any other action
that would individually or cumulatively reduce the site’s residential
development capacity.  §66300(b)(1)(A).  These prohibitions apply to any land use
designation amendment or change adopted on or after January 1, 2020, and any
change as of that date is void. 
§66300(b)(2).
            To maximize
the development of housing within this state, section 66300 should be broadly
construed and any exception thereto narrowly construed, including an exception
for the health and safety of occupants of a housing development project.  §66300(f)(2).
 
            4. The Coastal Act
            The California coastal zone is a distinct and valuable
natural resource of vital and enduring interest to all the people and exists as
a delicately balanced ecosystem.  Public
Resources (“Pub. Res.”) Code §30001(a). 
The permanent protection of the state’s natural and scenic resources is
a paramount concern.  Pub. Res. Code
§30001(b).  To promote the public safety,
health, and welfare, and to protect public and private property, wildlife, marine fisheries, and other
ocean resources, and the natural environment,
it is necessary to protect the ecological balance of the coastal zone and
prevent its deterioration and destruction. 
Pub. Res. Code §30001(c). 
            Future developments that are carefully planned and
developed consistent with the policies of the Coastal Act are essential to the
economic and social well–being of the people of this state and especially to
working persons employed within the coastal zone.  Pub. Res. Code §30001(d).  
            To achieve maximum responsiveness to local conditions,
accountability, and public accessibility, it is necessary to rely heavily on
local government and local land use planning procedures and enforcement.
 Pub. Res. Code
§30004(a).
            The Coastal Act is to be liberally construed to
accomplish its purposes and objectives. 
Pub. Res. Code §30009.  
Nothing in
the Coastal Act shall exempt local governments from meeting the requirements of
state and federal law with respect to providing low– and moderate–income
housing, replacement housing, relocation benefits, or any other obligation
related to housing imposed by other laws. 
Pub. Res. Code §30007.  
            The use of private lands suitable for visitor-serving
commercial recreational facilities designed to enhance public opportunities for
coastal recreation shall have priority over private residential, general
industrial, or general commercial development, but not over agriculture or
coastal-dependent industry.  Pub. Res.
Code §30222.
The Coastal
Act requires each local government within the coastal zone to prepare and submit
a Local Coastal Program (“LCP”) to the Coastal
Commission.  Pub. Res. Code §30500(a).  An LCP is comprised of a land use plan, which
functions as the general plan for property in the coastal zone, and a local
implementation plan, which includes zoning designations, zoning maps, and other
implementing actions.  Pub. Res. Code §§
30108.5, 30108.6.  Once an LCP is
approved, the local government is statutorily delegated the review authority
for development within that portion of the coastal zone.  Pub. Res. Code §30519(a).
            Aside from any other permit required by law from any
local government or from any state, regional, or local agency, any person
wishing to perform or undertake any development in
the coastal zone shall obtain a coastal
development permit (“CDP”) with some exceptions.  Pub. Res. Code §30600(a).  A CDP shall be issued if the issuing agency,
or the Coastal Commission on appeal, finds that the proposed development is in
conformity with the certified LCP.  Pub.
Res. Code §30604(b).
            The
California Coastal Commission (“Coastal Commission”) should encourage the
protection of existing and the provision of new affordable housing
opportunities for persons of low and moderate income in the coastal zone.  Pub. Res. Code §§ 30604(f), (g).  In reviewing residential development
applications as defined in section 65589.5(h)(3), the issuing agency may
not require measures that reduce residential densities below the density sought
by an applicant if the density sought is within the permitted density or range
of density established by local zoning plus the additional density permitted
under section 65915, unless the issuing agency or the Coastal Commission makes
a finding, based on substantial evidence in the record, that the density sought
by the applicant cannot feasibly be accommodated on the site in a manner that
is in conformity with the LCP or Pub. Res. Code
section 30200 et seq.  Pub. Res. Code §30604(f).
                        
            6. RBMC Provisions
The City has a certified LCP, which includes an implementing
Zoning Ordinance for the Coastal Zone (“Coastal
Ordinance”) intended to “protect and promote the public health, safety,
and general welfare” and to provide a precise guide for the growth and
development of the City in order to carry out the Coastal Act as applied to the
City in its LUP.   Redondo Beach Municipal Code (“RBMC”) §10-5.102 (AR
1576).  The
zoning regulations in the Coastal Ordinance shall apply to all land within the City’s
coastal zone except for public streets and rights-of-way.  RBMC §10-5.201(a) (AR 1578).  No development shall occur, no land shall be
used, and no structure shall be constructed, occupied, enlarged, altered,
demolished or moved in any zone except in accordance with the provisions of Chapter
10 of the RBMC.  RBMC §10-5.201(b) (AR
1578).
            The
applicant seeking to develop pursuant to the Coastal Ordinance shall file a
completed CDP application with the Department. 
RBMC §10-5.2210(a)(1) (AR 1828).  The
CDP application will not be determined to be complete and shall not be filed
until and unless the applicable requirements of RBMC section 10-5.2210 are
met.  RBMC §10-5.2210(c) (AR 1830).  The application must include specific
information as well as any such other data as may be required to demonstrate
that the project is consistent with the finding required under RBMC section
10-5.2218.  RBMC §10-5.2210(b)(19) (AR
1829-30). The application shall not be approved unless the decision-making body
finds, inter alia, that the proposed development is in conformity with
the City’s LCP.  RBMC §10-5.2218(c)(1)
(AR 1836).
 
            E. Statement of Facts
            1. The Housing Element
            On July 5, 2022, the
City adopted a draft housing element via Resolution No. CC-2207-048 to
incorporate recommended amendments from the HCD.  AR 333-40. 
The draft’s recitals explained that the City had been revising its
housing element since 2017.  AR 334.  HCD received the City’s latest draft housing
element for review on July 13, 2021.  AR
335.  HCD then issued a September 2, 2021
letter stating that the draft housing element addressed many statutory requirements
but needed revisions to fully comply with the Housing Element Law.  AR 335. 

            The City submitted
revisions on September 16, 2021, but did not receive new comments from HCD
until January 5, 2022. A R 336-37.  The City
Council adopted a revised housing element on February 8, 2022.  AR 338. 
HCD provided further comments on April 12, 2022 to bring the draft
element in compliance with the Housing Element Law.  AR 338. 
The City Council held a public hearing on July 5, 2022, considered the evidence
presented, and adopted the revised housing element of its general plan.  AR 339.
            On September 1, 2022,
HCD sent the City notice that it had completed its review of the housing
element adopted by the City Council on July 5, 2022.  AR 366. The City had addressed the statutory
requirements HCD identified in its April 12, 2022 review, and HCD concluded that
the housing element is in full compliance with the Housing Element Law.  AR 366. 

 
            2. The Project Application
On July 20, 2022,
NCD submitted a preliminary application for the Project.  AR 342. 
The Project included 133,943 square feet of residential floor area in 30
units and 7,124 square feet of commercial space, a total of 141,067 square feet.  AR 342. 
          NCD acknowledged that the
Property is located in a CC-4 zone, has a Coastal Commercial land use
designation in the coastal zone, and that residential land use is not permitted
or conditionally permitted in the CC-4 zone. 
AR 342.  However, six of the 30
units, or 20%, would be dedicated to lower-income residents.  AR 342. 
NCD asserted that it was entitled to develop the Project under section
65589.5(d) because the City’s housing element was not compliant with section
65580 et. seq.  AR 342.
            The preliminary
application form stated that it serves as a template for the preliminary
application for housing development projects seeking vesting rights pursuant to
SB 330, which is the HCA.  AR 344.  Submission of all the information required in
the form and payment of the processing fee freezes the fees and development
standards to those in effect as of the application date, unless an exception is
triggered under section 65889.5(o).  AR
344.
            On November 10, 2022,
NCD submitted its formal application for the Project.  AR 370-82. 
The formal application included applications for a CDP, Condominium
Subdivision, and Environmental Assessment, and a Combined Application for a Conditional
Use Permit and Planning Commission Design Review.  AR 370, 375, 379, 384.  
            The formal application
described the Project as a 142,557 square foot building with 35 residential units
and 8,614 square feet of floor space for commercial use.  AR 371, 376. 
Seven of the 35 units, or 20%, would be rented to lower-income
residents.  AR 380.  The application reiterated that the Project did
not comply with the development standards or permitted uses for a CC-4
zone.  AR 373, 380.  Nonetheless, NCD asserted that it was still entitled
to develop the Project under section 65589.5(d).  AR 380.
            On December 7, 2022, the
Department Director rejected the Project’s formal application as
incomplete.  AR 390, 838.  NCD had acknowledged that the residential
uses described in the Project application were inconsistent with both the City’s
general plan land use designation and the CC-4 zone.  AR 390. 
The rejection notice asserted that NCD was not entitled to develop the
Project under section 65589.5(d)(5) because the City Council adopted a
compliant housing element on July 5, 2022, which was before NCD submitted its
preliminary application on July 21, 2022. 
AR 390.  The Department Director
asserted that if NCD wished to pursue the Project, it would have to complete
either an application for a general plan amendment, LCP amendment, and zoning amendment.  AR 390-91.
            
            3. The City Council Appeal
            NCD appealed from the
Department Director’s rejection of its Project application.  AR 746. 
NCD argued that the Department Director’s December 7, 2022 rejection
notice did not qualify as a lawful notice of incomplete application because it failed
to identify the incomplete items and unlawfully rejected NCD’s builder’s remedy
rights.  AR 749.  The City’s argument as to section
65589.5(d)(5) was incorrect as a matter of law because HCD did not approve the City’s
housing element until after NCD submitted the preliminary application.  AR 749. 
The rejection notice also failed to include the “written findings, based
upon a preponderance of the evidence in the record” required by section
65589.5(d).  AR 749-50.
            The City set the appeal hearing
date for February 7, 2023.  AR 394.  In advance of the hearing, NCD sent the City
Council a letter summarizing its objections to the Department Director’s
rejection.  AR 673-81.  NCD attached a technical letter of assistance
from HCD for another project, dated October 5, 2022.  AR 682-83. 
The recipient had asked whether the rights which vest upon a preliminary
application still apply if the jurisdiction did not have a compliant housing
element when the applicant submitted the preliminary application but achieved
compliance during the entitlements process. 
AR 683.  HCD responded that those
rights do still apply.  AR 683.  Any potential benefits afforded to the
applicant due to the jurisdiction’s non-compliant status remain throughout the
entitlement process even if the jurisdiction then achieves compliance while the
entitlement process is ongoing.  AR 683.
 
            a. The Staff Report
            On February 7, 2023, City
staff issued a report outlining the facts of the case and the appeal hearing’s
structure.  AR 725-30.  The report included a slide presentation.  AR 731-38. 

            The report noted that
NCD’s application sought a CDP and other approvals.  AR 727. 
RBMC section 10-5.2210 outlines the necessary application procedures and
applicable requirements for CDPs.  AR
727.  This includes any data that might
be required to show a project is consistent with the findings required for
approval pursuant to RBMC section 10-5.2218. 
AR 728.  RBMC section 10-5.2218(c)(1)
requires the proposed development to be in conformity with the LCP.  AR 728. 
NCD admitted that CC-4 zoning does not allow for residential land
uses.  AR 735.  Because NCD admitted that the Project would
be inconsistent with the LCP, the Department Director determined that the
application was incomplete.  AR 728-29.  The staff report repeated the Department
Director’s conclusion that the Project application would have been complete if
NCD had filed applications for a general plan amendment, LCP amendment, and zoning
amendment.  AR 726-27.  
            The staff report did not
discuss the timeline of the City’s compliance with the Housing Element
Law.  See AR 731-38.  It did note that the HAA expressly states it
does not relieve the City from its obligation to comply with the Coastal Act
and that the City has in place an LCP and Coastal Ordinance.  AR 729. 
 
            b. The Appeal Hearing
            At the hearing, the
Department Director argued that the HAA does not excuse the City’s obligation
to comply with the Coastal Act.  AR
1203.  The City has an LCP, so it has an
obligation to ensure compliance with it. 
AR 1204.  The City’s CDP
application procedures have specific instructions for determining if an
application is complete, and it is incomplete if it does not meet all
requirements under RBMC section 10-5.2210. 
AR 1204.  This includes a
requirement to provide any data required to show that the project is consistent
with the findings required for approval pursuant to RBMC section 10-5.2218.  AR 1204. 
RBMC section 10-5.2218(c)(1) requires the proposed development to be in
conformity with the LCP.  AR 1204.  NCD’s application acknowledged that the
Project does not conform to the LCP and Coastal Ordinance because CC-4 zones do
not allow residential development.  AR
1204-05.  The Department Director therefore
concluded the application was incomplete. 
AR 1205.  The Department Director
also reiterated that if NCD wanted to develop residential uses on the Property,
it could submit an application for a general plan Amendment, LCP amendment, and
zoning amendment.  AR 1248-1249.
            The Department Director confirmed
that the City made no changes to the housing element after it was submitted to
HCD in July 2022.  AR 1270.
            NCD argued that the HAA
imposes lofty standards on a City seeking to reject a project application under
section 65589.5(d).  AR 1217.  These included the City’s duty to prove its
position by a preponderance of the evidence, issue a written record and
findings, and identify specific adverse impacts to health, safety, and welfare
based on objective written criteria in place at the time the application is
deemed complete.  AR 1217.  NCD argued that it was not looking for
Project approval until a later stage.  AR
1217.  It just wanted the City to fulfill
its mandatory duty to accept, receive, and process the application so the City Council
or other decision-making body could fully examine the merits of the
Project.  AR 1217.
            One Councilmember referenced
a discussion at a previous meeting about harmonizing the Coastal Act and the Density
Bonus Law.  AR 1265.  Pursuant to his understanding, harmonizing does
not mean ignoring zoning requirements. 
AR 1265.  It means meshing coastal
zoning and the Density Bonus Law and the Coastal Act.  AR 1265.[2]
 
            c. The City Council Resolution
            On
February 7, 2023, the City Council unanimously voted to pass Resolution No.
CC-2302-023 (“Resolution”) denying NCD’s appeal.   AR 1174-77. 

            The
Resolution recitals stated that the City’s housing element substantially
complies with state law and HCD also has concluded that the housing element
complies with state law.  AR 1174.  
The recitals also state that RBMC section 10-5.2210(c)
provides that any CDP application shall not be determined to be complete until
the requirements of RBMC section 10-5.2210 have been met.  AR 1174.  
RBMC section10-5.2210(b) establishes the requirements for a CDP,
including that the application contain such data as may be required to
demonstrate that the project is consistent with the findings require pursuant
to RMBC section 10-5.2218.  AR 1174.  In turn, RMBC section 10-5.2218 requires that
any CDP approval must be based on compliance with the LCP and policies of the
Coastal Act.  AR 1174.  NCD’s Property is designated by the LCP and
Coastal Ordinance as CC-4, which is a zone that does not allow for residential
uses.  AR 1174.  
The City Council resolved that NCD had submitted preliminary
and formal applications for a mixed-use housing development project in the CC-4
zone.  AR 1175.  The City’s LCP and Coastal Ordinance
establish the permitted uses in the CC-4 zone and NCD acknowledged that residential
uses are not allowed in a CC-4 zone. AR 1175. 
To submit a complete application under RBMC and LCP, the application must
comply with CDP application requirements in RMBMC section 10-5.22190(c),
including that the project comply with the LCP and the Coastal Act.  AR 1175. 
The applications demonstrated that the Project and its proposed
residential uses do not comply with the City’s certified LCP and the Coastal Ordinance.  AR 1175.
            The
City has an obligation to ensure compliance with the Coastal Act.  AR 1175. 
Accordingly, the Council upheld the Department Director’s determination
that the Project application was incomplete and could not be processed.  AR 1175. 
Because the public agency had rejected the Project, CEQA did not
apply.  AR 1175.
 
            E.
Analysis
Petitioner NCD seeks mandamus to set aside the City
Council’s denial of its appeal and to compel the City to process and approve the
Project application and issue all necessary Project approvals.[3]  NCD raises two issues: (1) the City violated
the HAA and the builder’s remedy applies; and (2) the Coastal Act does not support
the City Council’s denial of NCD’s appeal.
 
            1.
The HAA
The Project is a mixed-use development with 35 units of residential
use, 20% of which are to be set aside for rental to low-income residents.  The Project qualifies as an affordable
housing development under the HAA (§65589.5(h)(2) and (3)).  NCD argues that it has properly invoked the builder’s
remedy in section 65589.5(d) and its presumption of approval absent written
findings made by the City to satisfy an exception.  No such findings were made.  Pet. Op. Br. at 13.
a. The Standard
of Review for HAA Compliance
NCD argues that section 65589.5(d) creates
a presumptive burden of approval for all housing development projects for very
low-, low-, and moderate-income individuals. 
For a local jurisdiction to disapprove such a project, it must make “written
findings, based upon a preponderance of the evidence in the record” that one of
the exceptions contained within subdivision (d) exists; otherwise, it “shall not
disapprove” the project.  The
local jurisdiction bears “the burden of proof . . . to show that its decision
is consistent with the findings as described in subdivision (d), and that the
findings are supported by a preponderance of the evidence in the record.”  §65589.5(i); see also
§65589.6 (local
government “shall bear the burden of proof that its decision has conformed to
all of the conditions specified in Section 65589.5”).  Pet. Op. Br. at 13.
Section 65589.5(d) is referred to as the builder’s remedy
in part because qualifying projects enjoy a presumptive burden of approval that
a local agency cannot overcome without making the required findings supported
by a preponderance of evidence in the record.[4] 
NCD argues that, to deny the Project, the City was required to adopt
written findings that the Project “is inconsistent with both the jurisdiction’s
zoning ordinance and general plan land use designation . . . and the
jurisdiction has adopted a revised housing element in accordance with Section
65588 that is in substantial compliance with this article.”  §65589.5(d)(5).  Such written findings were required to “bridge
the gap” between evidence supporting one of the exceptions in section 65589.5(d) and disapproval
of the Project.  See Topanga, supra, 11 Cal.3d at 515.  Pet. Op. Br. at 13-14.
The City’s denial of NCD’s
application does not attempt to make written findings to satisfy any of the
five exceptions to prevent the builder’s remedy from applying to the Project.  The Resolution and the whole administrative
record tell only one story:  the City unlawfully
relied on a single staff member’s conclusion about the applicability of the
HAA.  The City abused its discretion when
it disapproved the Project by rejecting the Project application without making
written findings based upon a preponderance of the evidence to satisfy any of
the exceptions in section
65589.5(d).  Pet. Op. Br. at 14.
The City argues
that NCD has the burden of proof in an administrative mandamus proceeding to
show that no substantial evidence supports the findings.  Afford v. Pierno,
supra, 27 Cal.App.3d at 691. 
NCD cannot inject the HAA’s standard of review without showing that the
City disapproved the Project as defined by the HAA.  The City argues that it has not denied the Project
because the Project has not been processed or undergone review.  The City relies on the evidence in the City Council’s
Resolution, the staff report, and the Director’s December 7, 2022 letter.[5]
For
example, the Resolution states that NCD had submitted an application for a
mixed-use housing development project that includes a request for a CDP on a
site that is designated as Coastal Commercial and zoned as CC-4.  AR 1175. 
The City’s LCP and Coastal Ordinance establish the allowed uses within
the CC-4 zone.  Id.  NCD acknowledged in its applications that
residential uses are not allowed in the CC-4 zone.  Id. 
To submit a complete application for a coastal development permit under
the RBMC and LCP, the application must comply with the application requirements
for a CDP in RBMC Section 10-5.2210(c), which refers to all of the requirements
in RBMC section 10-5.2210, including the submittal of “other data” to
demonstrate consistency with the findings required for the approval of the
permit, including that the project comply with the LCP and the Coastal
Act.  Id.  Instead of demonstrating consistency, NCD’s
application demonstrated that the proposed project and proposed residential
uses do not comply with the LCP and the implementing Coastal Ordinance.  Id.
From this
evidence, the City concludes that it did not intend to, and did not, deny the Project.  Rather, the City determined that NCD’s
application was incomplete because it lacked necessary applications to amend
the governing land use ordinances, including the City’s LCP, to pursue
residential development on the Property. 
NCD remains able to pursue approval of its Project should it submit
necessary applications to amend the City’s governing land use requirements.  Opp. at 13.
The City
adds that the HAA’s builder’s remedy relates to constraints on ultimate project
denials, not project processing.  The HAA provisions relating to project denial
assume a complete application.  A local
agency shall not disapprove a housing development project [where] . . . [t]he
housing development project . . . is inconsistent with both the jurisdiction’s
zoning ordinance and general plan land use designation as specified in any
element of the general plan as it existed on the date the application was deemed complete,
and the jurisdiction has adopted a revised housing element in accordance with
Section 65588 that is in substantial compliance with this article….”  §65589.5(d)(5).  NCD offers no legal authority, nor is the
City aware of any, that authorizes NCD to proceed without a proper application
for its Project.  As a result, the City
was under no obligation to include HAA-required findings of denial, the HAA’s
builder’s remedy is not implicated, and the case is governed by the ordinary
administrative mandamus burden of proof. 
Opp. at 11-13.
NCD replies that the City’s demand for an application that
seeks a general plan amendment, LCP amendment, and zoning amendment qualifies
as a summary disapproval of the Project. 
NCD's submittal of the SB 330 preliminary application rendered the
application complete as a matter of law (see §65589.5(h)(5)), and the City's
determination of incompleteness was a tactical maneuver to dodge the HAA’s stringent
standards for denying a housing development project.  The HAA defines a housing development project
disapproval to include an instance where a local agency “[v]otes on a proposed
housing development project application and the application is disapproved,
including any required land use approvals or entitlements necessary for the
issuance of a building permit.  §65589.5(h)(6)(A).  The City's repudiation of NCD's builder's remedy
right and summary refusal to process the application falls squarely within this
definition.  The City Council ratified
the summary disapproval of the Project in the Resolution, which officially
declared that the City would not process, let alone approve, the Project.  The Resolution all but conceded this was a
disapproval in stating that "CEQA does not apply to projects which a
public agency rejects or disapproves."  AR 1177.

NCD does
not address all the statutory law concerning preliminary applications and their
completeness, but this law aids it.  HAA
section 65589.5(h)(5) provides that, as
pertinent to the Project, a preliminary application is “deemed complete” if it
has been submitted pursuant to section 65941.1. 
Section 65941.1 provides that a preliminary application shall be deemed
submitted if it provides listed information. 
§65941.1(a). Each local agency shall compile a checklist and application
form that housing development project applicants may use, and the checklist or
form shall not require or request any information beyond that expressly
identified in subdivision (a). 
§65941.1(b).  If the local agency
determines that the application is not complete, it shall provide the applicant
with an exhaustive list to that effect, limited to the items actually required
on the agency’s checklist.  §65943.
NCD does not explain whether its preliminary application
included the information required by section 65941.1(a) or used the City’s
checklist or form required by section 65941.1(b).  However, NCD’s preliminary application
appears to be on a City form listing the information required by section
65941.1(a) (AR 344-50), including “the proposed land uses by number of units
and square feet of residential and non-residential development using the
categories in the applicable zoning ordinance”. 
AR 348.  Thus, it appears that the
City should have deemed the preliminary application to be complete for purposes
of the HAA.  See §6558.5(h)(5).  The City Council’s determination was a
disapproval under the HAA rather than a determination of incompleteness.  See §65589.5(h)(6)(A).
As a
result, the HAA’s standard of review for denial of a project applies to HAA
issues.  The City’s denial was required
to make “written
findings, based upon a preponderance of the evidence in the record” that one of
the exceptions contained within 65589.5(d) exists.  §65589.5(i).  As discussed post, the City did not do
so. 
 
b. Whether
the City’s Housing Element Was Substantially Compliant When the Preliminary
Application Was Submitted
The exception to the builder’s
remedy pertinent to this case is that the housing development
project is inconsistent with both the jurisdiction’s zoning ordinance and
general plan land use designation as specified in any element of the general
plan as it existed on the date the application was deemed complete, and the jurisdiction
has adopted a revised housing element in accordance with section 65588 that is
in substantial compliance with the HAA. 
§65589.5(d)(5).  It is undisputed
that the Project is inconsistent with the City’s zoning and general plan land
use designations on the date the application was deemed complete.  Therefore, the issue is whether the City had
a revised housing element in substantial compliance with the HAA.
Under the HAA,
"a housing development project shall be subject only to the ordinances,
policies, and standards adopted and in effect" when a preliminary
application is submitted. 
§65589.5(o)(i).  This regulatory
freeze includes housing elements. 
§65589.5(o)(4) (frozen "'ordinances, policies, and standards'
includes general plan"); §65582(e) (housing element "means the
housing element of the community's general plan").  The freezing of development standards and
ordinances at the time a preliminary application is submitted allows the
development community to rely on the state of the regulatory regime in place so that it can
safely and confidently commit resources to development.  "[T]he private sector should be able to
rely" on a preliminary application "prior to expending resources and
incurring liabilities without the risk of having the project frustrated by
subsequent action by the approving local agency…."  Kaufman & Broad Central Valley, Inc.
v. City of Modesto, (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 1577, 1588 (concerning vesting of
tentative tract maps under section 66498.9(b)).  
NCD argues that the City’s development
standards were frozen when its July 21, 2022 preliminary application was
submitted.  §65589.5(o)(1).  The City’s housing
element was non-compliant at that time, and it did not attain a presumption of
compliance until HCD approved it on September 1, 2022.  Under the HAA
standard of review, the City could not make the written finding, based
upon a preponderance of the evidence, under section 65589.5(d)(5) that it was substantially
compliant with the Housing Element Law as of that date.  Therefore, the City could not deny the
Project under section 65589.5(d)(5) as a matter of law.  Yet, the City Council’s July 5, 2022 Resolution
makes an unsupported conclusion that its housing element substantially complies
with the Housing Element Law.  Pet. Op.
Br. at 15-16.
The City argues that it adopted its housing element on July 5, 2022 and
that it complied with the Housing Element Law at that time.  AR 333-41. 
NCD submitted its preliminary application on July 21, 2022 (R 726) and submitted
its formal application on November 10, 2022. 
AR 370-89.  The City did not
change or amend its housing element between the July 5 adoption and HCD’s September
1 222 certification letter.  AR 1270.  HCD’s certification letter did not require
the City to take further action or that its housing element only became valid
once certified by HCD.  Instead, HCD
found the City’s “adopted housing element in full compliance with State Housing
Element Law….”  AR 366.  Thus, the housing element fully complied with
state law as of its adoption on July 5, 2022. 
Opp. at 14.
In
support of its position, NCD relies on an October 5, 2022 HCD technical
letter which is in the administrative record. 
In the technical letter, HCD stated that, if a project application is
submitted “at a time when the jurisdiction does not have a compliant housing
element, any
potential benefits afforded to the applicant as a result of the jurisdiction’s
noncompliant status would remain throughout the entitlement process even if the
jurisdiction subsequently achieves compliance….”    AR 682-83. 
This statement is entitled to deference. 
Reddell v.
California Coastal Com., (2009) 180 Cal.App.4th 956, 965 (courts
generally defer to an agency’s interpretation when that agency possesses special
familiarity with the legal and regulatory issues at issue).  Pet. Op. Br. at 15-16.[6]
The HCD letter supports the conclusion that a project application
submitted before a local agency’s housing element substantially complies with
the Housing Element Law remains subject to the HAA’s builder’s remedy.  It does not, however, support a conclusion
that the local agency’s housing element must be approved by HCD before it can
be considered substantially compliant. 
For the latter conclusion, NCD relies on the language of the Housing
Element Law.  Section 65585 governs the
process for local jurisdictions to prepare and submit housing elements to the
HCD for compliance certification.  At least 90 days prior to adoption of a
revision of its housing element, the local jurisdiction shall submit a draft
element revision to HCD.  §65585(b)(1).  HCD shall review the draft and report its
written findings whether the draft element substantially complies with the
Housing Element Law within 90 days of its receipt.   §65585(b)(3), (d).  Prior to the adoption of its draft element,
the legislative body shall consider the findings made by HCD if they are timely
made.  §65585(e).  If HCD finds that the draft element does not
substantially comply, the legislative body shall either change the draft
element to comply or adopt the draft element without changes.  §65585(f). 
If the legislative body adopts without changes, it shall include in its
resolution of adoption written findings that explain why it believes the draft
element substantially complies with the Housing Element Law despite HCD’s
findings.  §65585(f)(2).  The planning agency shall submit a copy to
HCD promptly after adopting the element. 
§65585(g).
NCD summarizes the housing element
procedure as follows: (a) the submittal of a draft housing element to  HCD at least 90 days prior to adoption; (b) review by HCD of
the draft and preparation of the HCD's compliance findings within at least 60
days of the receipt; (c) consideration by the local government of the findings
made by the HCD prior to adoption; and (d) inclusion in the local government’s resolution
written findings which explain the reasons why the legislative body believes
that the draft element substantially complies with the Housing Element Law despite
HCD’s findings.  These steps are
mandatory.
The
court agrees with NCD (Reply at 9) that the City had not followed this
procedure as of the July 21. 2022 preliminary application.  The City Council’s Resolution No. CC-2207-048 shows that its draft housing element had undergone
various iterations and submissions to HCD. 
AR 334-37.  Resolution No. CC-2207-048 adopted the revised housing element, but it clearly
was intended to be submitted to HCD as a draft element revision under section 65585(b)(1).  Resolution No. CC-2207-048 adopted HCD’s
April 12, 2022 suggested changes (AR 338) and did not consider any other HCD
findings pursuant to section 65585(e).  Nor
did Resolution No. CC-2207-048 contain
the findings required by section 65585(f)(2) for the City to override HCD.  Consequently, the City still needed to submit
the revised housing element to HCD for a final compliance determination.   §65585(g). 
The City did so, obtaining HCD’s findings of compliance on September 1,
2022, but this occurred after NCD’s July 21 2022 preliminary application.  
Additionally, the HAA places the burden on the City to
prove that its housing element was in compliance with the Housing Element Law at
the time of submittal of the preliminary application.  §65589.5(i). 
That burden cannot be satisfied except by "written findings, based
upon a preponderance of the evidence in the record."  §65589.5(d). 
The City never made any findings that its housing element substantially
complied with the Housing Element Law as of July 5, 2022.  
In
sum, the procedure necessary for substantial compliance had not been met by the
date of NCD’s preliminary application.[7]  Under the
HAA, NCD may invoke the builder's remedy in section 6589.5(d).  In doing so, the City still can require NCD’s Project to comply with objective, quantifiable, written
development standards, conditions, and policies appropriate to, and consistent
with, meeting the jurisdiction’s share of the regional housing need.  §65589.5(f)(1).
2. The Coastal
Act
Nothing in
the HAA relieves the local agency from complying with, inter alia, the
Coastal Act.  §65589.5(e).  Unlike the HAA, NCD bears the burden of proving that the
Project complies with the Coastal Act.  
The Coastal
Act requires each local government within the coastal zone to prepare and submit
an LCP to the Coastal Commission.  Pub. Res. Code §30500(a).  An LCP is comprised of a land use plan, which
functions as the general plan for property in the coastal zone, and a local
implementation plan, which includes zoning designations, zoning maps, and other
implementing actions.  Pub. Res. Code §§
30108.5, 30108.6.  Once an LCP is
approved, the local government is statutorily delegated the review authority
for development within that portion of the coastal zone.  Pub. Res. Code §30519(a).
The City has a certified LCP, which includes the implementing
Coastal Ordinance intended to “protect and
promote the public health, safety, and general welfare” and provide a precise
guide for the growth and development of the City in order to carry out the
Coastal Act as applied to the City in its LUP.   RBMC §10-5.102
(AR 1576).  The
zoning regulations in the Coastal Ordinance apply to all land within the City’s
coastal zone except for public streets and rights-of-way.  RBMC §10-5.201(a) (AR 1578).  No development shall occur, no land shall be
used, and no structure shall be constructed, occupied, enlarged, altered,
demolished, or moved in any zone except in accordance with the provisions of Chapter
10 of the RBMC.  RBMC §10-5.201(b) (AR
1578).
            The
applicant seeking to develop pursuant to the Coastal Ordinance shall file a
completed CDP application with the Department. 
RBMC §10-5.2210(a)(1) (AR 1828). 
The CDP application will not be determined to be complete and shall not
be filed until and unless the applicable requirements of RBMC section 10-5.2210
are met.  RBMC §10-5.2210(c) (AR
1830).  The application must include
specific information as well as any such other data as may be required to
demonstrate that the project is consistent with the finding required under RBMC
section 10-5.2218.  RBMC
§10-5.2210(b)(19) (AR 1829-30). The application shall not be approved unless
the decision-making body finds, inter alia, that the proposed
development is in conformity with the City’s LCP.  RBMC §10-5.2218(c)(1) (AR 1836).
The City’s rejection of NCD’s application as
incomplete was principally based on its failure to comply with the LCP and
Coastal Ordinance.  The staff report noted that the HAA expressly
states it does not relieve the City from its obligation to comply with the
Coastal Act and that the City has in place the LCP and Coastal Ordinance.  AR 729. 
The staff report repeated the Department Director’s conclusion that the
Project application would have been complete if NCD had filed applications for
a general plan amendment, LCP amendment, and zoning amendment.  AR 726-27. 
It 
            At the appeal hearing,
the Department Director argued that the HAA does not excuse the City’s
obligation to comply with the Coastal Act. 
AR 1203.  The City’s CDP
application procedures have specific instructions for determining if an
application is complete, and it is incomplete if it does not meet all
requirements under RBMC section 10-5.2210. 
AR 1204.  This includes a
requirement to provide any data required to show the project is consistent with
the findings required for approval pursuant to RBMC section 10-5.2218.  AR 1204. 
RBMC section 10-5.2218(c)(1) requires the proposed development to be in
conformity with the LCP.  AR 1204.  NCD’s application acknowledged that the
Project does not conform to the LCP and Coastal Ordinance because CC-4 zones do
not allow residential development.  AR
1204-05.  
            While
the City Council’s Resolution denying NCD’s appeal summarily stated that the
City’s housing element substantially complies with state law as HCD also has
concluded (AR 1174), the bulk of the Resolution’s recitals concerned the LCP
and Coastal Ordinance requirements.  AR
1174.  The City has an obligation to
ensure compliance with the Coastal Act. 
AR 1175.  Accordingly, the City Council
upheld the Department Director’s determination that the Project application was
incomplete and could not be processed. 
AR 1175.  
             NCD argues that the Coastal Act states that
coastal access is for people of all income categories.  See Pub. Res. Code §30001(d) (future
developments consistent with the policies of this division are essential to the
economic and social well-being of the people of this state).  “It is important for the commission to encourage . .
. the provision of new affordable housing opportunities for persons of low and
moderate income in the coastal zone.” 
Pub. Res. Code §30604(g).  The Coastal Act also states that nothing in
its provisions “shall exempt local governments from meeting the requirements of
state and federal law with respect to providing low- and moderate-income
housing…imposed
by existing law or any law hereafter enacted.  Pub. Res. Code §30007.[8]  Pet. Op. Br. at 17-18.
NCD notes that the Coastal Act authorizes local governments
to issue CDPs, but the Coastal Commission maintains ultimate authority to
ensure local coastal development policies mesh with the overarching state
policies of the Coastal Act.  Charles A. Pratt Construction Co., Inc. v. California Coastal Com.,
(“Charles A. Pratt”) (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 1068, 1075.  To that end, the HAA and the Coastal Act must
be applied in harmony.  “Every statute
should be construed with reference to the whole system of law of which it is a
part, so that all may be harmonized and have effect.”  Mejia v. Reed, (2003) 31 Cal.4th 657, 663 (quoting Moore v. Panish, (1982) 32 Cal.3d 535, 541).  While the HAA does not relieve local
jurisdictions from complying with the Coastal Act, it does require them to
fashion compliance in a manner that does not render the affordable housing
project infeasible absent written findings that project denial is required by
state law.  See §65589.5(d)(3),
(e). 
The City’s implicit argument that the Coastal Act somehow overrides
the HAA is unsupported.  No conclusion
that one statute repeals another unless there is no rational basis for
harmonizing the conflicting statutes and they are so clearly inconsistent that
they cannot operate in unison.  Pacific Palisades Bowl Mobile Estates, LLC v. City of Los Angeles, (2012) 55 Cal.4th 783, 805.  Pet. Op. Br. at 18.
Given the Coastal Act’s repeated encouragement of low- and moderate-income
housing in the coastal zone, a harmonized reading of the two statutes supports
the conclusion that the HAA’s builder’s remedy is just as necessary in the
coastal zone as it is in non-coastal areas. 
Honoring both is critical to effectuate the legislative intent and
purpose of both statutes.  See Pub. Res. Code, §§ 30007, 30604(g).  This conclusion accords with the HAA’s urgent
policy declarations about California’s affordable housing crisis.  See §65589.5(a)(1)(B), (a)(2)(K).  Pet. Op. Br. at 18-19.
NCD contends that the Resolution’s conclusory assertion that
rejection of the Project application is necessary to fulfill the City’s obligation
to ensure compliance with the Coastal Act arises solely from the Project’s
inconsistency with the zoning and land-use designation in the LCP.  This inconsistency is overcome because the
Project properly invokes the builder’s remedy to secure approvals of affordable
housing projects regardless of otherwise applicable zoning.  It would be against logic, public policy, and
basic canons of statutory construction to find an exemption for the coastal zone
when no such exemption appears in the HAA or the Coastal Act.  Pet. Op. Br. at 19.
As the City argues (Opp. at 15-16), the crux of NCD’s
position is that the HAA allows NCD to ignore the City’s LCP and build a project
that is inconsistent with it.  NCD’s
argument is based on a false premise that the Coastal Act requirement that a
housing project in the coastal zone -- including low- and moderate-income
housing projects – must have a CDP pursuant to the City’s certified LCP and Coastal Ordinance is somehow inconsistent with the
HAA.  It is not.
NCD’s Project is in the coastal zone and, as a result,
NCD applied for a CDP.  The Coastal Act
requires all CDPs to conform to the certified LCP.  Pub. Res. Code §30604(b).  The City’s LCP does not permit any
residential uses with the Coastal Commercial land use designation or C-4 zone,
and NCD admits as much.  Nothing in the
Coastal Act authorizes the City to issue a CDP that is non-compliant with the
LCP and Coastal Ordinance.  The Coastal
Act does not contemplate that residential uses will occur within the coastal
zone on land not designated for residential uses.  In fact, it expressly references the HAA, and
encourages low- and moderate- income housing to be built in the coastal zone, but
only on sites zoned for residential uses as permitted by the LCP and Coastal
Ordinance.  If the use is authorized, the
issuing local agency (or the Commission on appeal) may not reduce the density
of low- or moderate-income housing projects if the density sought by applicant is within
the permitted density or range of density established by local zoning.  Pub. Res. Code §30604(f).  In
other words, a local jurisdiction is not free to disregard a low- or
moderate-income housing project’s conformity with its certified LCP and the
attendant allowable land uses and zoning in the coastal zone.  
The City properly relies on Kalnel Gardens, LLC v. City of Los Angeles, (“Kalnel”)
(2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 927.  There, the court
considered the relationship of the Coastal Act to state laws intended to foster
housing development.  Id. at
935.  A developer proposed a project that
would demolish an existing three-unit apartment building in the Venice area of
Los Angeles and build a total of 15 housing units. Id.  The project would include two units designated
for very low-income households and qualified under the HAA, Density Bonus Law
(§65915), and Mello Act (§65590) to exceed the applicable density restrictions
and height limitations.  Ibid.  The planning commission found that the
development did not conform to the Coastal Act due to the project’s size,
height, bulk, mass, and scale which were incompatible with and harmful to the
surrounding neighborhood.  Id. at 937.  The developer appealed to the city council,
which affirmed the denial on the same grounds. 
Ibid.  The developer sued for administrative
mandamus and the trial court found that the city violated certain provisions of
the HAA but also that the three housing laws (HAA, Density Bonus Law, and Mello
Act) were subordinate to the Coastal Act. 
Id.  The trial court also
found that substantial evidence supported the city’s findings that the project
was inconsistent with the certified Venice LUP. 
Ibid.  
On appeal, the primary issue was “whether the Coastal
Act in fact takes precedence over the various housing density provisions.”  Ibid.  The appellate court held that the Density
Bonus Act and Mello Act are subordinate to the Coastal Act.  Id.
at 943-46.  The court did not reach the issue
whether the HAA also is subordinate to the Coastal Act because the developer
failed to perfect its appeal on the HAA claim. 
However, the court stated: “Because the HAA similarly provides that it
shall not be construed to relieve local agencies from complying with the
Coastal Act (§65589.5(e)), if we were to reach that issue we would likely
conclude that it too was subordinate to the Coastal Act.”  Id.
at 944, n. 9.
Taken together, section 65589.5(e) (HAA does not
relief local agency from complying with the Coastal Act),[9] the Coastal Act
(Pub. Res. Code §30604), and Kalnel
all lead to the conclusion that NCD cannot ignore the City’s certified LCP under
the auspices of HAA’s builder’s remedy.  As
one Councilmember stated during the appeal hearing, “I think I have a pretty
good sense that harmonizing doesn’t mean ignoring zoning.”  AR 1265. 
See Opp. at 17.
The court need not find that the HAA is subordinate to
the Coastal Act because the two can be harmonized.  Within the coastal zone, the LCP and Coastal Ordinance
embody state public policy.  See Charles
A. Pratt, supra, 162 Cal.App.4th at 1075.  If NCD owned property in a residential area
of the coastal zone, it could apply for a CDP for a low- or moderate-income
housing project.  For its Property, NCD was
required either to propose a project consistent with the land uses and zoning
set forth in the LCP and Coastal Ordinance or propose amendments to change the
allowable land uses on the site.  Since
it did neither, the City Council correctly determined that the Project application
was incomplete under the Coastal Act.  
NCD makes no
attempt to distinguish Kalnel.  Instead, it argues that legislative changes were
enacted in response to Kalnel
which require harmonization of the Density Bonus Law (§65915) and the Coastal
Act.  AB 2797, signed in September of
2018, enacted changes to the Density Bonus Law to ensure that any density bonus
and/or development standard waivers and incentives "shall be permitted in
a manner that is consistent" with the Coastal Act.  2018 Cal. Legis. Serv. Ch. 904 (AB 2797).  The Legislature recognized the potential
chilling effect of Kalnel
and took prompt action to address the “decision's implied repeal of the [Density
Bonus Law] in the coastal zone” and mandate that the "the two statutes be
harmonized so as to achieve the goal of increasing the supply of affordable
housing in the coastal zone."  2018
Cal. Legis. Serv. Ch. 904 (AB 2797).  Reply
at 4-5.
NCD concludes that
the HAA similarly should be harmonized with the Coastal Act to facilitate the
construction of affordable housing in the coastal zone.  To that end, the Legislature enacted SB 167,
signed in September of 2017, which made further declarations concerning the
housing crisis, specifically that, it "is the policy of the state"
that the HAA "should be interpreted and implemented in a manner to afford the fullest
possible weight to the interest of, and the approval and provision, of housing."  2017 Cal. Legis. Serv. Ch. 368 (SB 167);
§65589.5(a)(2)(L).  In no instance can
harmonization mean writing whole sections of the HAA out of existence.  Gonzales & Co. v. Department of
Alcoholic Bev. Control, (1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 172, 178 (interpretations
rendering statutory provisions nugatory are to be avoided).  Reply at 5.
Apart from NCD’s
failure to cite a codified provision for the Density Bonus Law, its argument is
a strawman.  Nothing in the Coastal Act,
the LCP, and the Coastal Ordinance prevents low- and moderate-income housing
from being built in the coastal zone.  In
fact, such housing is encouraged.  But it
must be based in residential zones within the coastal zone.  NCD presents no evidence or argument that
this Coastal Act requirement presents a de facto ban on low- or
moderate-income housing in the City’s coastal area.
NCD argues that the
City's position is antithetical to the purpose of the builder's remedy, which
was expressly enacted to (1) relieve qualifying projects from the usual zoning
consistency requirement and (2) restrict local agencies' ability to reject such
projects, all as a consequence for failing to timely adopt a legally-compliant housing
element.  Reply at 4.  NCD ignores the fact that the Coastal Act
merely prevents NCD from applying the builder’s remedy in coastal zone areas
not available for residential use. 
Before the City’s housing element was approved by HCD, NCD was free to
apply the builder’s remedy anywhere in the coastal zone where the LCP and
Coastal Ordinance permitted residential housing.  
Finally, NCD relies
on public policy to argue that nothing in the state housing laws or the Coastal
Act supports the gigantic exception that the HAA does not apply in the coastal
zone.  Such an exception cannot be
countenanced due to the glaring public policy problems of a de facto
privileged zone along the entirety of the State's coast where affordable
housing development obligations can be ignored. 
The Coastal Act provides the opposite.  Pub. Res. Code section 30007.  Reply at 4.
Public policy does not support NCD’s argument.  The LCP and Coastal Ordinance embody state
public policy in the coastal zone.  See
Charles A. Pratt, supra, 162 Cal.App.4th at 1075.  As the City argues, NCD’s position would mean
that any portion of the coastal zone, including areas dedicated to
visitor-serving commercial and recreational uses, could be redeveloped to low-
and moderate-cost housing without any compliance with Coastal Act
policies.  This would eviscerate the
protections afforded to California’s coastal zone.  Opp. at 18.[10]

Conclusion
The Petition is
denied.  The City’s counsel is
ordered to prepare a proposed judgment, serve it on NCD’s counsel for approval
as to form, wait ten days after service for any objections, meet and confer if
there are objections, and then submit the proposed judgment along with a
declaration stating the existence/non-existence of any unresolved objections.  An OSC re: judgment is set for March 13, 2024
