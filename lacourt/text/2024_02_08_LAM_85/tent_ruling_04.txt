[1] Gabrielryan
attaches four exhibits to her opening brief. 
Three of the exhibits are excerpts from the Administrative Record.  AR 13-23, 45-47, 64-67.  The fourth exhibit is a letter from Uber,
dated January 15, 2023, stating that Gabrielryan created her driver account on
November 18, 2019.  
In administrative mandamus cases, the court’s review is
generally limited to the administrative record. 
Extra-record evidence may be considered only if the party seeking
inclusion of such evidence shows (1) the evidence could not have been presented
to the agency in the first instance in the exercise of reasonable diligence or (2)
was improperly excluded.  CCP §1094.5(e);
Fairfield v. Superior Court of Solano County, (1975) 14 Cal. 3d 768,
771-772. Western States, 9 Cal.4th at 578-579.  In addition, extra-record evidence is
admissible only if it relevant. Id. at 570.
The inclusion of extra-record
evidence is made through a motion to augment. 
LASC 3.231(g)(3).  As the CUIAB
notes, Gabrielryan never moved to augment the record with the Uber letter and
the court cannot consider it.  See Opp.
at 15.
