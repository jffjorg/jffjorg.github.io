            [1] Landlord seeks judicial notice
of various documents on file in this case (RJN Exs. A-O) and disputes the
accuracy of some of these documents.  Opp.
at 5.  The court need not judicially
notice the filings because it is always free to review prior filings in the
current action.  


            [2] The courts look to the
substance of an injunction to determine whether it is prohibitory or
mandatory.  Agricultural Labor
Relations Bd. v. Superior Court, (1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 709, 713.  A mandatory injunction — one that mandates a
party to affirmatively act, carries a heavy burden: “[t]he granting of a
mandatory injunction pending trial is not permitted except in extreme cases
where the right thereto is clearly established.”  Teachers Ins. & Annuity Assoc. v.
Furlotti, (1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 187, 1493.


            [3] However, a court may issue an
injunction to maintain the status quo without a cause of action in the
complaint.  CCP §526(a)(3).


            [4] Tenant miscategorizes them as
eviction notices.  Worthen Decl., ¶4(a).


            [5] Tenant cites Exhibit C of his
declaration in support of this point.  Worthen
Decl., ¶3(c), Ex. C.  This exhibit
consists of one page with the words “Health environmental Dept” and “Last test
Dec 27,” and two blank pages.  Worthen Decl.,
¶3(c), Ex. C.  


            [6] Tenant cites Exhibit H for
this assertion.  Worthen Decl., ¶7, Ex.
H.  There is nothing between the cover
pages for Exhibits H and I.  Worthen Decl.,
¶7, Ex. H.  


            [7] Although Tenant cites to
Exhibit K, it merely confirms that Boston is a DEH Chief Environmental Health
Specialist.  Worthen Decl., Ex. K.


[8] Landlord misreads the
minute order to require Tenant to serve Landlord with the minute order
itself.  Hinds Decl., ¶7.
