 Case Number:  23STCP00186    Hearing Date:   February 8, 2024    Dept:  85 
Lucine
Gabrielyan v. California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board, 23STCP00186

Decision on petition for
writ of mandate:    denied




 
            Petitioner
Lucine Gabrielyan (“Gabrielyan”) seeks a writ of mandate compelling Respondent California
Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board (“CUIAB”) to set aside its decision
affirming a determination by the California Employment Development Department’s
(“EDD”) that she is ineligible for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (“PUA”)
benefits.
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers and opposition (no reply was
filed), and renders the following decision. 

 
            A. Statement of the Case
            1. Petition
            Petitioner
Gabrielyan commenced this proceeding on January 24, 2023. The operative pleading
is the First Amended Petition (“FAP”) filed June 6, 2023 against Respondents
CUIAB and Uber, alleging a cause of action for administrative mandamus.  The unverified FAP alleges in pertinent part
as follows.
            Gabrielyan
is a divorced mother of two children with a difficult financial situation.
            During
her hearing before the CUIAB’s Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”), Gabrielyan was
out of the country and attended remotely. 
She asked the ALJ to speak slowly because of her limited English
skills.  She still was unable to
understand the ALJ.  Her daughter had
COVID-19 at the time, which stressed her out.
            Gabrielyan
was therefore unable to present facts at the hearing.  This included the fact that she opened her Uber
Eats (“Uber”) account in November 2019. 
However, she was unable to start work until February 2022 because of
COVID-19.
            Gabrielyan
seeks a writ of mandate compelling the CUIAB to find her eligible for PUA
benefits.
 
            2. Course of Proceedings
            On
February 4, 2023, Gabrielyan served the CUIAB with the Petition by mail.
            On
May 18, 2023, the court ordered Gabrielyan to file an FAP naming Uber as a Real
Party-in-Interest.
            On
June 7, 2023, Gabrielyan filed the FAP and served Uber with the FAP and Summons
by mail.
            On
July 10, 2023, CUIAB filed an Answer. 
            On
August 17, 2023, Gabrielyan personally served Uber with the Petition.

            B. Standard of Review
            Code
of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section 1094.5 is the administrative mandamus
provision which structures the procedure for judicial review of adjudicatory
decisions rendered by administrative agencies. 
Topanga Ass’n for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles, (“Topanga”)
(1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 514-15.  The
pertinent issues under CCP section 1094.5 are (1) whether the respondent has
proceeded without jurisdiction, (2) whether there was a fair trial, and (3)
whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion.  CCP §1094.5(b).  An abuse of discretion is established if the
respondent has not proceeded in the manner required by law, the decision is not
supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by the
evidence.  CCP §1094.5(c).
 CCP section 1094.5
does not in its face specify which cases are subject to independent
review.  Fukada v. City of Angels
(1999) 20 Cal.4th 805, 811.  Instead,
that issue was left to the courts.  In
cases reviewing decisions which affect a vested, fundamental right the trial
court exercises independent judgment on the evidence.  Bixby v. Pierno, (1971) 4 Cal.3d 130,
143.  See CCP §1094.5(c).  An employer or an employee challenging a
decision granting or denying unemployment insurance benefits involves a fundamental
right requiring application of the independent judgment test.  Interstate Brands v. Unemployment
Insurance Appeals Board, (1980) 26 Cal.3d 770, 775-76, 780. 
Under the independent judgment test, “the trial court not
only examines the administrative record for errors of law but also exercises
its independent judgment upon the evidence disclosed in a limited trial de
novo.”  Id. at 143.  The court must draw its own reasonable
inferences from the evidence and make its own credibility determinations.  Morrison v. Housing Authority of the City
of Los Angeles Board of Commissioners, (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 860,
868.  In short, the court substitutes its
judgment for the agency’s regarding the basic facts of what happened, when,
why, and the credibility of witnesses.  Guymon
v. Board of Accountancy, (1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 1010, 1013-16.



“In exercising its independent judgment, a trial court must
afford a strong presumption of correctness concerning the administrative
findings, and the party challenging the administrative decision bears the
burden of convincing the court that the administrative findings are contrary to
the weight of the evidence.”  Fukuda
v. City of Angels, (1999) 20 Cal.4th 805, 817.  Unless it can be demonstrated by petitioner
that the agency’s actions are not grounded upon any reasonable basis in law or
any substantial basis in fact, the courts should not interfere with the
agency’s discretion or substitute their wisdom for that of the agency.  Bixby v. Pierno, supra, 4
Cal.3d 130, 150-151; Bank of America v. State Water Resources Control Board,
(1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 198, 208.
The agency’s decision must be based on the evidence
presented at the hearing.  Board of
Medical Quality Assurance v. Superior Court, (1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 860,
862.  The hearing officer is only
required to issue findings that give enough explanation so that parties may
determine whether, and upon what basis, to review the decision. Topanga,
supra, 11 Cal.3d at 514-15. 
Implicit in section 1094.5 is a requirement that the agency set forth
findings to bridge the analytic gap between the raw evidence and ultimate
decision or order.  Topanga, 11
Cal.3d at 15.
An agency is presumed to have regularly performed its
official duties (Evid. Code §664), and the petitioner therefore has the burden
of proof to demonstrate wherein the proceedings were unfair, in excess of
jurisdiction or showed prejudicial abuse of discretion.  Alford v. Pierno, (1972) 27 Cal.App.3d
682, 691.  The burden of proof falls upon
the party attacking the administrative decision to demonstrate wherein the
proceedings were unfair, in excess of jurisdiction or showed prejudicial abuse
of discretion.  Id. 
 
            C. Governing Law
            Title
15 United States Code (“15 USC”) section 9021 authorized the provision of
unemployment benefits to individuals who were otherwise able and available to
work but are unable to do so for one of the COVID-19 related reasons identified
in the statute.  A “covered individual”
includes anyone who provides self-certification that the individual is
otherwise able to work and available for work within the meaning of applicable state
law, except the individual is unemployed, partially unemployed, or unable or
unavailable to work because of one of eleven listed reasons.  15 USC §9021(a)(3)(A)(ii)(I).  Alternatively, the individual may provide self-certification
that the individual is self-employed, is seeking part-time employment, does not
have sufficient work history, or otherwise would not qualify for regular
unemployment or extended benefits under state or federal law or pandemic
emergency unemployment compensation under section 9025, and otherwise meets the
requirements of section 9021(a)(3)(A)(ii)(I). 
15 USC §9021(a)(3)(A)(ii)(II).  
            In
either case, the individual must provide documentation to substantiate
employment or self-employment or the planned commencement of employment or
self-employment not later than 21 days after the later of the date on which the
individual submits a PUA application under 15 USC section 9021 or the date on
which an individual is directed by the State Agency to submit such
documentation in accordance with Title 20 Code of Federal Regulations (“20 CFR”)
section 625.6(e) or any successor thereto, except that such deadline may be
extended if the individual has shown good cause under applicable state law for
failing to submit such documentation.  15
USC §9021(a)(3)(A)(iii).  
            CUIAB
hearings shall be conducted in English. 
22 California Code of Regulations (“22 CCR”) §5063(a).  If a party or witness does not proficiently
speak or understand English and requests language assistance before the hearing
commences, the agency shall provide the party or witness an interpreter in the
hearing at the expense of the agency.  22
CCR §5063(b).
            A
party who files a CUIAB appeal has the right to file an application to present
new or additional evidence.  22 CCR
§5102(a).  Except as otherwise provided in
22 CCR section 5102 or specified by the agency, the application shall be filed
and served at the same time the board appeal is filed.  Id. 
The application shall state the nature of the evidence, the materiality
of such evidence, and the reasons why such evidence was not introduced at the
hearing before the ALJ.  22 CCR
§5102(d).  If the new or additional
evidence is documentary in nature, the applicant shall attach the evidence to
the application.  Id.  No such evidence shall be considered unless
the CUIAB admits it.  Id.
 
D. Statement
of Facts[1]
            1. The EDD Determination
            Gabrielyan applied for PUA
benefits.  In a January 17, 2022 document
styled as an affidavit, Gabrielyan asserted that she is a 36-year-old student at
Glendale Community College and a single mother of two children.  AR 32. 
On March 20, 2020, she had an interview with Yerevan Premium Foods (“Yerevan”).  AR 32. 
The interview went well, and she was slated to work as a counter server beginning
April 1, 2020.  AR 20.  The supervisor later called her and said that Yerevan
could not hire new employees because of the COVID-19 pandemic.  AR 32.
            On January 21, 2022, EDD
mailed Gabrielyan a Notice of Determination (“NOD”) concluding that her
evidence was insufficient to show that she was, or planned to be, self-employed
or employed.  AR 2.  Therefore, she did not qualify for PUA
benefits for any weeks of employment ending on or after December 27, 2020.  AR 2. 
The NOD explained that she had until February 22, 2022 to appeal the
decision to an ALJ with an explanation of why she disagreed with the NOD.  AR 3.
 
            2. The Initial Appeal
            On February 9, 2022, Gabrielyan
appealed the EDD’s decision.  AR 4.  She stated that she interviewed with Yerevan on
March 20, 2020 and was hired to start work as a counter server on April 1.  AR 4. 
However, the supervisor called her and said that Yerevan could not hire
new employees because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
AR 4.  Her search for a job in
Glendale has otherwise been unsuccessful. 
AR 4.
            The appeal form included
a section which inquired whether Gabrielyan needed a translator and in what
language.  AR 4.  Gabrielyan left this question blank.  AR 4.  
            Gabrielyan attached to her appeal a February
9, 2022 letter from Yerevan supervisor Hovhannes Hovhannisyan (“Hovhannisyan”).  
AR 5.   The letter was on a blank
sheet of paper without Yerevan letterhead. AR 5.  Hovhannisyan confirmed that Gabrielyan was
hired on March 20, 2020 but terminated before her April 1 start date because of
the pandemic.  AR 5.  Hovhannisyan invited the EDD to call his
office at the listed number.  AR 5.
            On June 20, 2022, CUIAB
sent Gabrielyan a Notice of Hearing informing her of the July 12, 2022 appeal
hearing date.  AR 9.  The notice advised Gabrielyan that she needed
to file any additional documents for consideration with the CUIAB’s Pasadena
Office of Appeals by June 27, 2022.  AR
9.  Otherwise, the ALJ could choose to
exclude such documents.  AR 9.  The notice also advised her to contact the Pasadena
Office of Appeals if she needed an interpreter or reasonable
accommodation.  AR 9.  
 
            3. The ALJ Hearing
            At the hearing, Gabrielyan
confirmed that the CUIAB had sent the Notice of Hearing to the correct
address.  AR 15.  The ALJ then explained EDD had found
Gabrielyan ineligible for PUA benefits under 15 U.S.C. section 9021(a)(3)(A)(iii),
and 20 C.F.R. section 625.6(e)(2) because she did not provide documents to
prove that she was employed or self-employed. 
AR 15.  Gabrielyan said that she
understood and had no questions.  AR
15-16.
            Gabrielyan said that she
was out of the country and hoped that they would not be disconnected.  AR 16. 
She also said that her English is “not as good.”  AR 16. 
The ALJ replied they could proceed with the hearing and “work on” any
disconnections that may arise.  AR 16.  The ALJ explained the procedure that would be
used, and Gabrielyan said that she understood. 
AR 16-17.
            The ALJ reviewed the
evidence, including Gabrielyan’s January 17 letter and Hovhannisyan’s February
9 letter.  AR 17.  Gabrielyan confirmed she had a chance to look
through every exhibit and did not object to their admission into evidence.  AR 17-18.
            Gabrielyan testified
that she opened a PUA claim around April 5, 2020 and received payment through August
28, 2021.  AR 18-19.  She did not work in 2019 because she was a
full-time student.  AR 19.  
The ALJ then asked Gabrielyan
if she worked in 2020 before she opened her PUA claim.  AR 19. 
When Gabrielyan did not answer, the ALJ asked if Gabrielyan understood
her.  AR 19.   After Gabrielyan stammered “the question – I
– I,” the ALJ noted that she had the chance to ask for an interpreter when she
filed her appeal but did not do so.  AR
19.  Because Gabrielyan was out of the
country, the ALJ did not want to have to reschedule the hearing for later that
day to find an interpreter; there were too many chances she would not be able
to reconnect with Gabrielyan.  AR
19-20.  
            The ALJ then asked if Gabrielyan
felt she could go on without an interpreter or whether she needed one.  AR 20. 
When she replied she did need one, the ALJ reiterated that she did not
have one present.  AR 20.  She suggested it would be better for Gabrielyan
to have a new hearing.  AR 20.  Gabrielyan opted instead to try to answer the
questions, if the ALJ asked slowly.  AR
20.  Based on Gabrielyan’s statement, the
ALJ said “we’ll go forward.”  AR 20.
            Gabrielyan testified that
she did not work in 2019 or 2020.  AR
20.  She is still a student but has been
looking for work.  AR 20-21.  She interviewed with Yerevan, a food company
that makes and sells sausages and Armenian meat.  AR 21-22. 
When the ALJ asked if it was a grocery market, Gabrielyan denied it and repeatedly
said it was like a “fabric.”  AR 21.  When she clarified Yerevan made and sold
food, the ALJ identified it as a “food seller.” 
AR 21-22.
            Gabrielyan would have started
work in April 2020, but Yerevan closed because of the pandemic and could not
take on new employees. AR 22.  The ALJ
asked whether Yerevan reopened.  AR
22.  When Gabrielyan asked her to repeat
the question, the ALJ clarified the question was whether it reopened earlier
than a lot of other businesses.  AR
22-23.  Gabrielyan said that it did
not.  AR 23.  The ALJ asked why Gabrielyan did not go back
to working for Yerevan when it reopened. 
AR 23.  Gabrielyan replied that it
was out of business and still closed.  AR
23.
 
            4. The ALJ’s Decision
            On July 19, 2022, the
ALJ mailed Gabrielyan a decision affirming EDD’s decision to deny PUA benefits.  AR 45-49.
            The ALJ stated that, when
Gabrielyan opened a PUA claim on April 5, 2020, she was required to provide
documentation to verify employment or self-employment.  AR 46. 
She was not employed between 2019 and 2021 and was a full-time student
in 2019 and 2020.  AR 46.  She still is not working.  AR 46.
             Gabrielyan had no documents to confirm
employment or self-employment prior to opening the claim for benefits.  AR 46. 
Hovhannisyan’s February 9 letter said Gabrielyan was offered a job with
Yerevan but terminated before her start date due to the pandemic.  AR 46. 
This letter was not on official letterhead or under penalty of perjury.  AR 46.
            The ALJ explained that
under section 2102(a)(3)(A)(iii) of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic
Security Act, Public Law 116-136, someone who applies for PUA assistance before
January 31, 2021 and receives assistance for any weeks after December 26, 2020
shall provide documentation of employment or self-employment, or the planned
commencement thereof, within 90 days of submission of the application.  AR 46-47. 
It must demonstrate employment or self-employment, or the planned
commencement thereof, at some point between the start of the applicable taxable
year and the date of filing the PUA claim. 
AR 47.
            Gabrielyan did not provide
documentation that would substantiate actual or planned employment or
self-employment and therefore was ineligible for PUA under 15 USC
section 9021(a)(3)(A)(iii) and 20
C.F.R. section 625.6(e)(2).  AR 47.  
            Gabrielyan had provided
a letter from an alleged employer, and she did testify she was offered a job
but could not start because of the pandemic. 
AR 47.  However, the ALJ found the
testimony improbable and disbelieved it because Gabrielyan had no employment
history, she was offered employment after the pandemic began yet did not go to
work for the employer once the pandemic restrictions had lifted.  AR 47. 
Gabrielyan also currently was not working.  AR 47. 

 
            5. The CUIAB Appeal
            On August 16, 2022, Gabrielyan
appealed the ALJ’s decision.  AR 50.  She attached a letter from Uber dated August
15, 2022, which confirmed that she had an active Uber driver account from
February 25 to August 15, 2022.  AR
52.  Her most recent trip was on June 28,
2022 and she had 98 total trips.  AR
52.  She also submitted an echocardiogram
report from August 3, 2022, and a letter from WM Dental confirming she received
outpatient treatment from September to November 2022.  AR 53-54.
            Gabrielyan asserted on
the CUIAB appeal form that she was unable to present these documents at the ALJ
hearing because of her limited English skills. 
AR 50.  She was registered to
drive for Uber before the COVID-19 pandemic, but that pandemic kept her from
working.  AR 50.  She now works for Uber while attending
Glendale Community College.  AR 50.  Because she was in Armenia during the ALJ
hearing to treat her and her children’s heart problems, she could not answer
the questions in “full, sufficient English.” 
AR 50.
            On December 21, 2022,
the CUIAB affirmed the ALJ decision.  AR
64, 66.  It had found no material errors
in its issue statement or findings of fact, and the reasons for the decision
properly applied the law to the facts. 
AR 65.  It therefore adopted all
three as its own.   AR 65. 
            As for Uber’s letter and
the medical documents, Gabrielyan should have presented them at the hearing.  AR 65. 
The Notice of Hearing advised Gabrielyan to bring all witnesses,
statements, documents, and other relevant evidence to the hearing.  AR 65. 
She has not established good cause for her failure to do so.  AR 65. 
In any event, the new evidence only established that she worked for Uber
for a period after she filed her PUA claim. 
AR 65.   Her medical records do
not support a conclusion that she was employed, self-employed, or planned to
commence either.  AR 65.
            An ALJ has the
responsibility of weighing and evaluating the testimony of witnesses and
resolving conflicts in the testimony.  AR
65.  The CUIAB should accept an ALJ’s
findings unless they are manifestly against the weight of the evidence.  AR 65-66. 
This was not the case and the ALJ’s decision was affirmed.  AR 66.
 
            E.
Analysis
            Petitioner
Gabrielyan disputes the CUIAB’s denial of PUA benefits on three grounds: (1)
she should have been given an interpreter and (2) the evidence of her
employment was sufficient and she did not commit a fraud.
Gabrielyan argues that the ALJ
hearing was fraught with linguistic misunderstandings and technical difficulties.  English is her second language, and she is
not fluent.  The ALJ should have
rescheduled the hearing until an interpreter was available.  Gabrielyan said so at the hearing but the ALJ
ignored the request.  After she was
refused an interpreter, Gabrielyan asked the ALJ to speak slowly so that maybe
she would understand.  The ALJ should
have realized the futility of the situation, as shown by the fact that Gabrielyan
referred to Yerevan as a company that
makes “Armenian meat” and then “fabric”. 
There also was a misunderstanding about whether Yerevan was closed
because of COVID, or permanently, or both. 
This lack of clarity was critical to Gabrielyan’s evidence that she was
seeking work and the ALJ should have delayed the hearing for an
interpreter.  Pet. Op. Br. at 1-2.
The CUIAB correctly rebuts
Gabrielyan’s argument concerning an interpreter.  “[A] fair administrative hearing…affords the
appellant a reasonable opportunity to be heard.”  Pinheiro
v. Civil Service Com. for County of Fresno, (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 1458, 1463. (internal quotations omitted).
The CUIAB shall provide an
interpreter if a party “requests language assistance before the hearing
commences.”  22 Cal. Code Regs.
§5063(b).  Gabrielyan timely appealed
EDD’s determination.  The appeal form
completed by her asked whether a translator would be needed, and if so, in what
language.  AR 4.  Gabrielyan did not request an interpreter.  Ibid. 
Gabrielyan received the notice of the ALJ hearing, and the notice directed
her to call the Pasadena Office of Appeals immediately if an interpreter was
needed for the hearing.  AR 5.  Gabrielyan again did not request an
interpreter.  AR 19.  Although twice given the opportunity,
Gabrielyan did not request an interpreter before the commencement of the July
12, 2022 ALJ hearing.
At the hearing, Gabrielyan presented her case, which proceeded
without any disruptions even though Gabrielyan was out of the country.  AR 13-23.  When the ALJ then asked
Gabrielyan if she worked in 2020 before she opened her PUA claim, Gabrielyan
did not answer.  AR 19.  The ALJ asked if Gabrielyan understood
her.  AR 19.   After Gabrielyan stammered a response, the
ALJ noted that Gabrielyan had not asked for an interpreter when she filed her
appeal.  AR 19.  Because Gabrielyan was out of the country,
the ALJ did not want to reschedule the hearing for later that day after an
interpreter was found; there were too many chances she would not be able to
reconnect with Gabrielyan.  AR
19-20.  
            The ALJ then asked if Gabrielyan
felt she could go on without an interpreter or whether she needed one.  AR 20. 
When Gabrielyan replied she did need one, the ALJ reiterated that she
did not have one present and suggested it would be better to continue the hearing
to another day.  AR 20.  Gabrielyan opted instead to try to answer the
questions, if the ALJ asked slowly.  AR
20.  Based on Gabrielyan’s statement, the
ALJ said “we’ll go forward.”  AR 20.   Thus, Gabrielyan did state her English was not
good at the outset of the hearing, but she wanted to go forward with the
hearing that day without an interpreter. 
Throughout the hearing, Gabrielyan confirmed that she
understood the ALJ’s questions and responded to them appropriately.  AR 15-23. 
When asked whether she understood the topics they were going to talk
about, Gabrielyan stated she did.  AR
15.  Gabrielyan confirmed she had a chance to look through every exhibit and
did not object to their admission into evidence.  AR 17-18. 
Gabrielyan also asked for clarification when she did not
understand a question.  AR 22-23.  
Gabrielyan was not denied a fair hearing because she did not
have an interpreter.
 
2. The Evidence
Was Insufficient
            The ALJ explained that
Gabrielyan was required to provide documentation of employment or
self-employment, or the planned commencement thereof, at some point between the
start of the applicable taxable year and the date of filing the PUA claim.  AR 47.
The ALJ stated that,
when Gabrielyan opened a PUA claim on April 5, 2020, she was required to
provide documentation to verify employment or self-employment.  AR 46. 
She was not employed between 2019 and 2021 and was a full-time student
in 2019 and 2020.  AR 46.  She still was not working at the time of the
hearing.  AR 46. 
            Gabrielyan testified
that she was offered a job but could not start because of the pandemic.  AR 47. 
Hovhannisyan’s February 9 letter said Gabrielyan was offered a job with
Yerevan but terminated before her start date due to the pandemic.  AR 46. 
This letter was not on business letterhead or under penalty of perjury.  AR 46.
The ALJ disbelieved
the testimony improbable and the letter because Gabrielyan had no employment
history, the Yerevan letter stated that she was offered employment that was
disrupted by the pandemic, and yet she did not go to work for Yerevan once the
pandemic restrictions were lifted.  AR
47.  Gabrielyan also was not working at
the time of the hearing.  AR 47.  The ALJ concluded that Gabrielyan did not provide
documentation that would substantiate actual or planned employment or
self-employment and therefore was ineligible for PUA under 15 USC
section 9021(a)(3)(A)(iii) and 20
C.F.R. section 625.6(e)(2).  AR 47.  
Gabrielyan argues
that the lack of communication between herself and the ALJ affected the ALJ’s
decision.  The ALJ cast doubt on the
Yerevan letter.  However, the letter was
written almost two years later, the business was permanently closed, and access
to the letterhead of a closed business may be impractical.  This was a small business and not many
employers would hire an attorney to draft a letter for a person the business
did not even hire.  Pet. Op. Br. at 2.
The CUIAB’s opposition points out that Gabrielyan’s argument
that Yerevan was permanently closed and access to letterhead may be impractical
is rebutted by the fact that Hovhannisyan’s letter states to contact his office
number listed below.  The letter was
written on February 9, 2022, and its content makes it appear to be an open
business.  Opp. at 14.
In short, Gabrielyan
had not worked in the years before COVID and did not work after the pandemic,
either at Yerevan or anywhere else.  Hovhannisyan’s
letter is not a reliable document to show Gabrielyan’s planned employment and the
ALJ was entitled to disregard Gabrielyan’s bare testimony that she planned to
work at Yerevan.
 
3. The CUIAB Was
Entitled to Exclude the Uber Letter
The CUIAB found Gabrielyan’s Uber letter submitted for
appeal to be immaterial because it showed Gabrielyan worked from February 25 to
August 15, 2022, which was outside the timeframe of the case.  Gabrielyan argues that the CUIAB did not
consider that Gabrielyan created her Uber account on November 1, 2019.  The letter clearly shows that Gabrielyan was
an Uber independent contractor beginning November 2019 and commenced employment
in February 2022, which satisfies the UPUA requirements.  Pet. Op. Br. at 2.
Gabrielyan ignores the fact that the CUIAB was not required
to admit the Uber letter.  
“An application to
present new or additional evidence shall state the nature of the evidence, the
materiality of such evidence, and the reasons why such evidence was not
introduced at the hearing before the administrative law judge.”  22 Cal. Code Reg. §5102(d).  
 
Gabrielyan failed to make any showing of good cause. The CUIAB found that the Notice of Hearing
advised Gabrielyan to bring all witnesses, statements, documents, and other
relevant evidence to the ALJ hearing.  AR
65.  She did not establish good cause for
her failure to do so and the Uber letter was properly excluded.  See AR 65.
In any event, the August 15, 2022 Uber letter does not aid
Gabrielyan.  When the ALJ asked if she
worked in 2019 or 2020, Gabrielyan testified that she did not work and was a
full-time student. AR 19-20.  The Uber letter
only verified that Gabrielyan was an active driver on the Uber app from
February 25, 2022 to August 15, 2022.  AR
52.  These dates are after the pandemic
and do not support her claim seeking benefits for 2020.

Conclusion
The Petition is denied. 
The CUIAB’s counsel is ordered to prepare a proposed judgment, serve it
on Petitioner’s counsel for approval as to form, wait ten days after service
for any objections, meet and confer if there are objections, and then submit
the proposed judgment along with a declaration stating the
existence/non-existence of any unresolved objections.  An OSC re: judgment is set for March 21, 2024
