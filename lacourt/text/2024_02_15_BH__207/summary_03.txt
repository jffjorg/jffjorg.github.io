And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

Based on the information presented, I, the Judge, hereby issue this tentative ruling. The plaintiff, John Doe, claims that the defendant, Jane Smith, made a false representation that harmed him. To establish this claim, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant made a false representation, knew it was false, intended to deceive, and that the plaintiff reasonably relied on the representation and was harmed as a result.

In California Civil Code ยง 1710, a deceit is defined as "the suggestion, as a fact, of that which is not true..." To prove deceit, the plaintiff must show that the defendant made a representation, knew it was false, intended to deceive, and that the plaintiff reasonably relied on the representation and was harmed.

The California Civil Jury Instruction 1900 (2022 ed.) outlines the elements of deceit, requiring the plaintiff to prove that the defendant represented a fact as true, the representation was false, the defendant knew it was false or made it recklessly, the defendant intended for the plaintiff to rely on the representation, the plaintiff reasonably relied on the representation, the plaintiff was harmed, and that the plaintiff's reliance on the representation was a substantial factor in causing the harm.

Based on the evidence presented, I find that the plaintiff has established a prima facie case of deceit and that the defendant's representation was false and harmful. The case will proceed to trial for further evidence and argument.
