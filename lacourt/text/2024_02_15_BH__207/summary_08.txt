And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Gursey Schneider LLP (Petitioner) v. (none) (Respondent). The Petitioner had sought to confirm an arbitration award in the amount of $357,153.02, which was issued on April 26, 2023. The Petitioner had previously failed to serve the Respondent with the petition and notice of hearing, and the Court had previously ordered that the hearing be continued to allow the Petitioner to perfect service.

At the hearing, the Petitioner filed a proof of service by mail, indicating that the petition, notice of hearing, and related documents were served on the Respondent by mail. However, the Court finds that this service was still insufficient, as the Petitioner failed to serve the Respondent personally or via substitute service in accordance with the rules for service of a summons.

Therefore, the Court denies the Petition without prejudice for failure to comply with the service requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1290.4. The Court will continue the confirmation hearing to February 15, 2024, to allow the Petitioner to perfect service and provide notice of the continued confirmation hearing.
