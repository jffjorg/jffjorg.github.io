Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for terminating and monetary sanctions against the Plaintiff, Ryan Macdhubhain, in a case involving a dispute over the termination of his employment. The Plaintiff claims that the Defendants, Advanced Nutrients, Inc., Advanced Nutrients US, LLC, and Michael Straumietis, failed to pay him an additional 6 months of salary and commission as agreed in a December 2019 letter agreement. However, the Defendants contend that the Plaintiff provided an altered version of the letter agreement and are seeking sanctions for the misuse of the discovery process.

The judge notes that the Plaintiff's provision of the altered letter agreement constitutes a misuse of the discovery process, but the judge is not convinced that it warrants terminating and monetary sanctions. The judge also finds that the Plaintiff's changing testimony regarding the source of the altered letter agreement and the fact that Melissa Jordan, a former employee, emailed the Plaintiff the letter agreement three months after her own termination, demonstrate that the Plaintiff knowingly or at least negligently produced a false and altered copy of the letter agreement.

The judge denies the Defendants' motion for terminating and monetary sanctions, as well as the Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions. The judge orders the Defendants to provide notice of the Court's ruling and file a proof of service of such.
