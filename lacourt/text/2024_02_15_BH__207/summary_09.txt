And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Christmas Brothers Inc., moves to enforce a settlement agreement with defendants Alex Corral, Vanessa Martinez, and Vanessa Michelle Co. The agreement requires Corral to pay the plaintiff $32,194.19 within 20 days of execution. The court notes that the parties executed the agreement on October 11, 13, and 14, 2023, respectively. However, the plaintiff fails to provide proof of service demonstrating that the motion to enforce settlement was properly served on the defendants. Code of Civil Procedure section 1005 requires written notice of the motion to be served at least 16 court days prior to the hearing. Therefore, the court denies the plaintiff's motion to enforce settlement without prejudice for failure to serve notice of the motion. The plaintiff is directed to provide notice of the court's ruling and file a proof of service regarding the same.
