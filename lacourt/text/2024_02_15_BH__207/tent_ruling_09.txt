MOTION
 
Plaintiff Christmas Brothers Inc. (“Plaintiff”) moves to enforce the
settlement agreement entered into between Plaintiff and Defendants Alex Corral
(“Corral”), Vanessa Martinez, and Vanessa Michelle Co. (collectively, “Defendants”).  Plaintiff’s motion is unopposed.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 provides that “[i]f parties to
pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the
presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case,
or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the
terms of the settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6.)  In ruling on a motion to enter judgment, the
court acts as a trier of fact. The court must determine whether the parties
entered into a valid and binding settlement. To do so, the court may receive
oral testimony in addition to declarations. (Kohn v. Jaymar-Ruby, Inc.
(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1530, 1533.)
 
The
issue on a motion to enforce settlement agreement under Code of Civil Procedure
section 664.6 is whether the parties entered into a valid and binding
settlement agreement. (See Viejo v. Bancorp. (1989) 217 Cal.App.3d 200,
209, fn. 4 [“a court's power to make factual determinations under section 664.6
is generally limited to whether the parties entered into a valid and binding
settlement agreement”].)  In other words,
the only issue before the court is whether an agreement exists; not whether the
agreement has been breached.
 
Attached
as Exhibit “E” to Tina M. Alleguez’s Declaration is a copy of the settlement
agreement, fully executed by Plaintiff and Defendants, where Defendant Corral
was to pay Plaintiff $32,194.19 within twenty days of the execution of the
Agreement.  Corral executed the agreement
on October 11, 2023; the other defendants executed the agreement on October 13,
2023, and Plaintiff executed the agreement on October 14, 2023.
 
However,
Plaintiff has not provided a proof of service demonstrating that the motion to
enforce settlement was properly served on Defendants.  Code of Civil Procedure section 1005 requires
that written notice of the motion be served at least 16 court days prior to the
hearing.  
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
            Therefore, the Court denies
Plaintiff’s motion to enforce settlement without prejudice for failure to serve
notice of the motion on Defendants in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure,
section 1005.  
 
            Plaintiff shall provide notice of
the Court’s ruling and file a proof of service regarding the same.
