And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is in response to a demurrer filed by the defendant, Michael Keyes DBA Global Ocean and Land Construction, to the second amended complaint (SAC) filed by the plaintiff, Glenn Vallecillos M.D., Inc. The plaintiff seeks to recover damages for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and other claims related to the remodel of the plaintiff's surgical center. The defendant argues that the SAC fails to state a cause of action and that the plaintiff has unlawfully added causes of action and parties without proper leave of court.

The judge rejects the defendant's demurrer, finding that the SAC adequately states a cause of action and that the plaintiff has properly amended the complaint. The judge also finds that the defendant's arguments regarding misjoinder and procedural defects are procedurally improper and should have been raised in a motion to strike rather than a demurrer.

The judge orders the defendant to file and serve an answer to the SAC by February 29, 2024, and to provide notice of the court's ruling and file a proof of service regarding the same.
