MOTION


Petition for Confirmation of Arbitration Award




MOVING PARTY


Petitioner Gursey Schneider LLP




OPPOSING PARTY


(none)



 
BACKGROUND
 
            On or about April 26, 2023, an
arbitrator issued an Arbitration Award in favor of Petitioner Gursey Schneider
LLP (“Petitioner”) in the amount of $357,153.02.  On July 7, 2023, Petitioner filed the instant
Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award (the “Petition.)  On November 16, 2023, a hearing was scheduled
for December 15, 2023.  No response was
filed.
 
            The Court previously noted that Code
of Civil Procedure section 1290.4 requires that the Petition and Notice of
Hearing be served on Respondent “in the manner provided in the arbitration
agreement for service of such petition and notice” or “[i]f the arbitration
agreement does not provide the manner in which such service shall be made …
[s]ervice within this State shall be made in the manner provided by law for the
service of summons in an action.”  (See December
15, 2023 Minute Order [quoting Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.4].)  
 
Because the Court found the Agreement does not provide the manner in
which service and notice of a petition to confirm the arbitration award are to
be effectuated, the Court found Petitioner’s purported service by mail to be
insufficient, and held that service must be effectuated via either personal or
substitute service, in accordance with the rules for service of a summons.  (See December 15, 2023 Minute Order.)
 
            At the hearing, Petitioner requested
that in lieu of denying the Petition, the Court continue the hearing to allow
Petitioner to perfect service of the Petition and provide notice of the
continued confirmation hearing.  The
Court agreed, and continued the confirmation hearing to February 15, 2024.
 
            On January 4, 2024, Petitioner filed
a proof of service by mail, indicating the Petition, Notice of Hearing, and
related documents were again served on Respondent by mail.  
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
The Court finds that
Petitioner has failed to serve Respondent with the Petition and Notice of
Hearing either personally or via substitute service in accordance with the
rules for service of a summons, and pursuant to the Court’s December 15, 2023
Order.  Therefore, the Court denies the
Petition without prejudice for failure to comply with the service requirements
of Code of Civil Procedure section 1290.4.
