 Case Number:  22STCV38730    Hearing Date:   January 11, 2024    Dept:  74 Anoosh
Sarkis Harootoon v. Aris Shahnazari, et al.
Defendants’ Motion to Expunge Lis
Pendens
BACKGROUND 
            This
action arises from a dispute over real property.
            On
December 13, 2022, Plaintiff Anoosh Sarkis Harootoon (Plaintiff) filed a
complaint against Defendants Aris Shahnazari and Armineh Estepanian
(Defendants). Plaintiff alleges the following causes of action: (1) Quiet
Title, (2) Constructive Trust, (3) Fraud, Deceit, and Misrepresentation, (4)
Conversion, (5) Accounting, (6) Financial Elder Abuse, (7) Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress.
            On
December 14, 2022, Plaintiff recorded a notice of lis pendens.
            On
December 19, 2023, Defendants filed this motion to expunge the lis pendens. 
LEGAL STANDARD
            A lis pendens may be ordered
expunged if the operative complaint does not contain a real property claim or
the plaintiff cannot establish the claim’s probable validity by a preponderance
of the evidence. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 405.31, 405.32.) The burden of proof is
on the party opposing the motion to expunge. (Code Civ. Proc., § 405.32.)
            Plaintiff’s
evidentiary objections are preserved.
DISCUSSION 
            In
support of her opposition, Plaintiff argues in part that her complaint contains
a real property claim: namely, a cause of action for quiet title. (Complaint,
¶¶ 19-24.) The court agrees. Next, Plaintiff contends that she is likely to
prevail on the merits of her quiet title claim. (Water for Citizens of Weed
California v. Churchwell White LLP (2023) 88 Cal.App.5th 270, 281 [“The
purpose of a quiet title action is to establish title against any adverse
claims to property or any interest therein.”].) In support, Plaintiff offers
evidence that aims to undermine Defendants’ credibility. Plaintiff also submits
evidence that she financially contributed to Defendants’ down payment on the property
and paid for improvements to the property. (Harootoon Decl., ¶¶ 3-10; Exs. 2-7,
Ex. 8, p. 98.) But title to the property was placed in Defendants’ names only.
(Complaint, ¶ 9.) Plaintiff has not cited any authority demonstrating how
Plaintiff’s contributions to the subject property creates a fee interest. Thus,
Plaintiff has not met her burden of showing the probable validity to her quiet
title claim.[1]
            Alternatively,
Plaintiff argues that her cause of action for constructive trust is another
real property claim. The court disagrees. In this context, “[r]eal property
claim means the cause or causes of action in a pleading which would, if
meritorious, affect (a) title to, or the right to possession of, specific real
property.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 405.4.) By contrast, a constructive trust is an
equitable remedy rather than a substantive claim for relief. (American
Master Lease LLC v. Idanta Partners, Ltd. (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 1451,
1485.) To the extent Plaintiff seeks a constructive trust to recoup funds that
Defendants allegedly converted, a lis pendens is not proper. (BGJ Assocs.,
LLC v. Sup.Ct. (M2B2, LLC) (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 952, 972.) Thus, Plaintiff
has not met her burden for the purposes of Defendants’ motion to expunge the
lis pendens. 
            Defendants’
counsel seeks attorney fees. (Code Civ. Proc., § 405.38.) But Defendants’
counsel has not requested a specific amount or substantiated his request. Thus,
the court declines to award attorney fees.
CONCLUSION 
The
court grants Defendants’ motion to expunge the lis pendens. The court denies
Defendants’ request for attorney fees.
Defendants
shall give notice.
