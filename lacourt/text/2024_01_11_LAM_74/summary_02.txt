And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by the judge regarding a motion to expunge a lis pendens filed by the defendants. The lawsuit arises from a dispute over real property and the plaintiff's complaint contains several causes of action, including quiet title, constructive trust, and fraud. The defendants argue that the plaintiff's complaint does not contain a real property claim and therefore the lis pendens should be expunged. The judge agrees that the plaintiff's complaint contains a real property claim, specifically a cause of action for quiet title, but finds that the plaintiff has not met the burden of showing the probable validity of her quiet title claim. The judge grants the defendants' motion to expunge the lis pendens and denies their request for attorney fees.
