And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of the defendant's person most knowledgeable. The plaintiff, Julio Garcia, alleges that the defendant, the County of Los Angeles, discriminated against him based on his ethnicity. The plaintiff seeks to compel the deposition of the defendant's person most knowledgeable to obtain relevant information about the alleged discrimination.

The court finds that the categories sought in the deposition notice appear relevant and discoverable. However, the court is concerned about the plaintiff's utilization of "DOCUMENTS RELATED TO" which appears to be improperly overbroad in scope and nature.

The court also notes that the deposition may go forward, and any objections or Pitchess motions will be addressed at the deposition. The court will then rule on any objections through a Pitchess procedure if necessary.

The court declines to impose sanctions on the plaintiff, finding that the plaintiff acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of sanction unjust.
