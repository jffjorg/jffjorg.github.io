Significant Statements:
  - "A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction." (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal. App. 4th 967, 992.)
```

The judge's tentative ruling is that the plaintiff's motion for sanctions is denied. The judge finds that the defendant's supplemental responses to special interrogatories were adequate, despite being incomplete, and that the plaintiff failed to meet and confer before filing the motion. The judge also notes that the defendant's "document dump" of over 3,000 documents was not a willful violation of the court order and does not warrant sanctions.
