And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted Defendant Amit Jain's motion to maintain certain filings made in support of his motion for summary judgment under seal. The filings in question include documents that contain confidential financial information, including bank account numbers, account balances, and home addresses of Defendant Jain and third parties. The judge found that the financial records should remain sealed because the right to privacy overrides the public's right to access the information. The judge also ordered that two documents be unsealed, including Defendant Jain's memorandum of points and authorities in support of his motion for summary judgment, and an excerpt of his deposition transcript.
