The Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The court has considered the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendant, Aspire Bakeries, LLC, in the case of JC/SC, LLC, etc. v. ARYZTA, LLC, etc., et al. The court has also considered the request for judicial notice filed by the defendant.

The court grants the motion to strike with thirty days leave to amend. The court notes that the demurrer is moot due to the dismissal of the second cause of action.
