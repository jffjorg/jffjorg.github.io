  CASE NO.:  24STCV05249
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
 
DEMURRER TO PLAINTIFF’S SECOND AMENDED
  COMPLAINT
 
MOTION TO STRIKE 
 
Date: October 8,
  2024
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
 
 



 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant
Aspire Bakeries, LLC (“Aspire” or “Defendant”)
 
RESPONDING PARTY: None

 
            The Court has considered the moving
papers. No opposition papers were filed.
 
BACKGROUND
             This action arises out of a lease
relationship. As originally filed on March 1, 2024, Plaintiff’s complaint (the “Complaint”)
alleges two claims: (1) Breach of Lease; and (2) Common Count. 
 
On
July 1, 2024, Defendant Aspire filed the instant demurrer (the “Demurrer”) to the
second cause of action in the Complaint.  On July 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Request
for Dismissal without prejudice of the Second Cause of Action for Common Count
Only, which dismissal was entered in September 26, 2024.  The Demurrer is therefore MOOT.
 
Defendant
concurrently filed a motion to strike (the “Motion”) portions of the Complaint
in the first cause of action of the Complaint. 
Plaintiff has not filed an opposition to the Motion, which was due
September 24, 2024.  
             
MEET AND CONFER 
The meet and confer requirement has been met for the
Motion.
 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
            Defendant requests judicial notice of the entirety of the lease (the “Lease”)
referenced in the Complaint, which Aspire has attached as Exhibit 1 to its
Request for Judicial Notice (the “RJN”). 
A portion of the RJN’s Exhibit 1 is attached as Exhibit 1 of the
Complaint, and it appears from the fact that Plaintiff filed no objection or
opposition to the RJN that there is no dispute as to the fact that the complete
version of the Lease is attached as Exhibit 1 to the RJN.  Based on Performance Plastering v.
Richmond American Homes of California, Inc. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th
659, 666, n. 2, the Court GRANTS the RJN for the purpose of this Motion.
 
DISCUSSION
Motion to Strike
The court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its
discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or
improper matter inserted in any pleading.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 436(a).)  The court may also strike all or any part of
any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a
court rule, or an order of the court.  (Id.,
§ 436(b).)  The grounds for a motion to
strike are that the pleading has irrelevant, false or improper matter, or has
not been drawn or filed in conformity with laws.  (Id., § 436.)  The grounds for moving to strike must appear
on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice.  (Id., § 437.)
 
Here, Defendant moves to strike specified language
from Plaintiff’s Complaint, namely:
1)    Page 5, line 17
(beginning with “defendants, and each of them”) through line 20 (ending with “$100,000.”)
2)    Paragraphs 18-19
3)    Page 6, line 23
(beginning with “(a)”) through line 24 (ending with “operation”)
4)    Page 6, line 25 (beginning
with “(c)” through “Allowance,”)
5)    Page 7, line 4: “loss
of percentage rent”
6)    Page 7, line 5
(beginning with “costs”) through line 6 (ending “Premises.”)
 
As
noted above, Plaintiff has not filed any opposition to the Motion.  The failure to file an opposition creates an
inference that the motion is meritorious. (Sexton v. Superior Court
(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.) 
Based upon this inference, the Court GRANTS the Motion with thirty days
leave to amend.
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
 
Dated this 8th day of October, 2024
