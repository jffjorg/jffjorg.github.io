  CASE NO.:  24STCP02249
 
ORDER RE: CONTINUANCE OF HEARING ON 
PETITION TO CONFIRM ARBITRATION AWARD
 
Date: October 8, 2024
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
 
 



 
MOVING PARTY: Petitioner
LPL Financial, LLC and, on behalf of Unnamed Party, Janelle O’Brien (“Petitioner”)
RESPONDING PARTY: None
 
            The court considered the moving papers
filed in connection with this petition (the “Petition”). No opposition to the Petition
was filed; however, the Declaration of Bentley P. Stansbury in Support of
Notice of Motion and Petition to Confirm Arbitration and Award (the
“Declaration”) does not, as filed, include the Exhibits referenced therein,
which are necessary to support the Petition. 

 
            The Court therefore, on its own
motion, continues the hearing on the Petition to allow Petitioner the
opportunity to re-file the Declaration with all referenced exhibits.  The Amended Declaration must be filed on or before
October 22, 2024 and the hearing on the Petition is hereby continued to
November 12, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.  Any
opposition to the Amended Declaration must be filed by 5, 2024.
 
 
Petitioner
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
 
 
Dated this 8th day of October 2024
