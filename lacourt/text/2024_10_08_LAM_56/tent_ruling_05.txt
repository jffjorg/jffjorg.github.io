  CASE NO.:  24STCV16723
 
ORDER RE: MOTION FOR CHANGE OF VENUE
 
 
Date: October 8, 2024
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
 
 



 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant
John R. Calderon (“Defendant”)
RESPONDING PARTY: None
 
            The Court has considered the moving
papers filed in connection with this motion (the “Motion”). No opposition to
the Petition has been timely filed.  Any
opposition was due on September 24, 2024. The failure to file an opposition
creates an inference that the motion is meritorious.  (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)  
 
            The Motion seeks an order pursuant
to California Code of Civil Procedure, Section 397 to transfer the venue of
this action to the South District of the Los Angeles Superior Court, located at
the Governor George Deukmejian Courthouse, located at 275 Magnolia Street in
Long Beach, CA 90802.  The basis for this
Motion is that this Courthouse is not the proper venue for this matter, as the
property at issue in this case and all parties are located within the
jurisdiction of the South District of the Court.  
 
            Based upon the evidence provided in support
of the Motion, and given that the Motion is unopposed, the Motion is GRANTED.
 
Defendant
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
 
 
Dated this 8th day of October 2024
