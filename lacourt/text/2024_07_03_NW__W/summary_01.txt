And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling in this case states that the defendants' motion to compel arbitration, stay action, and for award of attorney fees and costs is moot. The court finds that the defendants' request for attorney fees is not supported by the record, as the plaintiff's position that the defendants made it difficult to go to arbitration is supported by the record. The court also notes that the plaintiff was forced to bring this action before the four-year statute of limitations had run. The court denies the request for attorney fees and costs, and the motion is denied as moot.
