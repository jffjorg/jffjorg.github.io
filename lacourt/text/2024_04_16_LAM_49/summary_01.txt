Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied Google's motion for summary adjudication of the Third Cause of Action for violation of the California Uniform Trade Secrets Act. The court found that ReactX has established triable issues of fact regarding the extent to which the patent application contained trade secret information and the extent to which the user manuals contained trade secret information. The court also found that ReactX has established triable issues of fact regarding the extent to which the code was obfuscated and the extent to which Google's engineers were able to reverse engineer the code.

The court also denied Google's motion for summary adjudication of the First and Second Causes of Action for breach of contract and breach of implied covenant, respectively. The court found that the same disputed material facts that preclude summary adjudication of the Third Cause of Action also preclude summary adjudication of the First and Second Causes of Action.
