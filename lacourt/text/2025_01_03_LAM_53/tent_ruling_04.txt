The court notes that, on May 23, 2024, the court overruled McGausa’s demurrer
to the First Amended Cross-Complaint on this ground.  (May 23, 2024 Minute Order, pp. 3-4.) 


[2] The
Second Amended Cross-Complaint does not identify against whom each cause of
action is asserted as required.  (Cal.
Rules of Ct., rule 2.112, subd. (4) [each cause of action must state “[t]he
party or parties to whom it is directed”].)

Although McGausa argues that Cross-Complainant was required, and failed, to include
evidence to support this cause of action in the cross-complaint, the court disagrees.  (Juarez v. San Bernardino City Unified
School District (2024) 106 Cal.App.5th 1213, 327 Cal.Rptr.3d 665, 674 [“‘To
survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a
cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the
plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged’”].) 
The court also notes that the court previously overruled McGausa’s
demurrer to the second cause of action on this ground.  (May 23, 2024 Minute Order, p. 4.)

The court notes that it previously overruled McGausa’s demurrer to the third
cause of action on this ground.  (May 23,
2024 Minute Order, p. 1.)
