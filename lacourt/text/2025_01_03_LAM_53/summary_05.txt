And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff to provide further responses to form interrogatories, specifically regarding requests for admission numbers 12, 14, and 15. The plaintiff's answers to these interrogatories are incomplete because they do not sufficiently identify the "certain conditions that never took place" referenced in their responses. The court finds that the plaintiff's failure to provide complete answers is not sufficient grounds for imposing sanctions against the plaintiff, and therefore denies the defendant's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $9,465. The court orders the plaintiff to serve further, full and complete answers to the interrogatory within 20 days of the date of this order.
