And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the Second Amended Cross-Complaint and has determined that it does not identify against whom each cause of action is asserted, which is a requirement under California Rules of Court, rule 2.112, subdivision (4). The judge has previously overruled McGausa's demurrer to the First, Second, and Third causes of action, but notes that the Second Amended Cross-Complaint does not provide sufficient evidence to support these causes of action. The judge cites Juarez v. San Bernardino City Unified School District (2024) 106 Cal.App.5th 1213, 327 Cal.Rptr.3d 665, 674, which states that a complaint only needs to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action, and does not need to include evidence to support the cause of action. The judge is making a tentative ruling, which is subject to change at the next hearing.
