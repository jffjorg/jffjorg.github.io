MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant and cross-complainant
Lillian Nevarez, individually and as trustee of the Hector and Lillian Nevarez
2005 Family Trust dated November 16, 2005            
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Plaintiff and cross-defendant Elva Aranjo, as co-trustee of
Crisanto Nevarez and Carmen Nevarez Revocable Trust dated April 6, 2004, as
amended and restated September 26, 2007
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One,
and Request for Sanctions
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Defendant and cross-complainant Lillian Nevarez, individually and as
trustee of the Hector and Lillian Nevarez 2005 Family Trust dated November 16,
2005 (“Defendant”) moves the court for an order (1) compelling plaintiff and
cross-defendant Elva Aranjo, as co-trustee of Crisanto Nevarez and Carmen
Nevarez Revocable Trust dated April 6, 2004, as amended and restated September
26, 2007 (“Plaintiff”) to provide further responses to Defendant’s Form
Interrogatory, number 17.1, as it concerns Requests for Admission numbers 12,
14, and 15, and (2) awarding monetary sanctions in favor of Defendant and
against Plaintiff in the amount of $9,465.
The court grants Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s further
response to Form Interrogatory, number 17.1, subdivision (b), as to Requests
for Admission numbers 12, 14, and 15 because Plaintiff’s answers to those
interrogatories are incomplete since Plaintiff has not sufficiently identified
the “certain conditions that never took place” that she has referenced in her
responses, such that the answers are not full and complete.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a)(1).)  
            The court finds that the
circumstances presented would make the imposition of sanctions unjust and
therefore denies Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions against
Plaintiff.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300,
subd. (c).) 
ORDER
            The court grants in part defendant
and cross-complainant Lillian Nevarez, individually and as trustee of the
Hector and Lillian Nevarez 2005 Family Trust dated November 16, 2005’s motion
to compel further responses to form interrogatories, set one, and request for
sanctions, as follows. 
            Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2030.300, the court orders plaintiff and cross-defendant Elva Aranjo,
as co-trustee of Crisanto Nevarez and Carmen Nevarez Revocable Trust dated
April 6, 2004, as amended and restated September 26, 2007 to serve further,
full and complete answers to defendant and cross-complainant Lillian Nevarez,
individually and as trustee of the Hector and Lillian Nevarez 2005 Family Trust
dated November 16, 2005’s Form Interrogatory, number 17.1, subdivision (b), as
to Requests for Admission numbers 12, 14, and 15, which
(1) identify the “certain conditions that never took place” referenced in those
responses, and (2) comply with Code of Civil Procedure sections
2030.210-2030.250, within 20 days of the date of this order.
            The court orders defendant and
cross-complainant Lillian Nevarez, individually and as trustee of the Hector
and Lillian Nevarez 2005 Family Trust dated November 16, 2005, to give notice
of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  January 3, 2025
