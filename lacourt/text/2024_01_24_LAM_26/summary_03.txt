Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English:

The Court has considered the motions to compel further responses to form interrogatories (employment law) and to compel a deposition filed by the defendants. The plaintiff has filed an amended response to the form interrogatories, but the oppositions filed by the plaintiff are untimely and will not be considered.

The Court finds that the defendants have sufficiently met and conferred with the plaintiff regarding the deposition, and therefore grants the motion to compel the plaintiff's deposition. The Court orders the plaintiff to appear for a deposition within 10 days of notice of this order at a date, time, and location noticed by the defendants.
