And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge rules that the plaintiff's motion to quash the deposition subpoena is granted. The judge finds that the subpoena was not properly served on the deponent, Medvei Law Group, APC, and that the requested information is not relevant to the case. The judge also notes that the defendant's actions may be retaliatory and may violate the plaintiff's right to privacy. The judge refuses to award monetary sanctions to either party at this time, but warns that future requests for sanctions will be strictly scrutinized.
