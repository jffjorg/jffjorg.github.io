I. BACKGROUND¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
A. Factual¿¿¿ 
 
This lawsuit is based on Plaintiffs alleged
suffering years of mistreatment at the hands of their uphill-neighbor in
Rolling Hills, Nourit Korzennik, Korzennik’s alleged misconduct towards the
Nakamuras included, but was not limited to: spitting on Mrs. Nakamura; mooning
Mrs. Nakamura and her family; performing sexually offensive and lewd gestures
toward the Nakamuras; illegally trespassing onto the Nakamura’s property twice
and chopping down their trees that spanned 365 feet; trapping the Nakamuras in
their car; photographing and recording the Nakamuras and their family, along
with workers and visitors without their consent, including by the use of
drones; harassing and preventing utility and other workers from entering the
Nakamura property – going so far as to hit a worker with her car – promoting a
call to the Los Angeles County Sherriff’s Office on this and many other
occasions; Sherriff’s Officers advising the Nakamuras to obtain a restraining
order on multiple occasions to protect their personal safety; Korennik’s
multiple allegedly frivolous lawsuits against the Nakamuras; and claimed abuse
of the administrative process to block the rebuilding of the Nakamura family
home that burned in a fire over a decade ago. 
 
On December 13, 2023, this Court heard Plaintiffs’ Motion
to Enforce Settlement Agreement, which required Defendant Nourit Korzennik to
move out of 26 Chinchring Rd., Rolling Hills, CA 90274. This Court GRANTED that
motion, stayed the liquidated damages through January 1, 2024, and ordered that
Defendant vacate by January 1, 2024, or be subject to the liquidated damages
amount per violation, and $2,500 in reasonable attorney’s fees. This order, in
reference to the liquidated damages, noted that for violating the settlement
agreement, Defendant would be required to pay $1,000 per violation to
Plaintiffs commencing January 2, 2024. Prior to the matter being dismissed and
pursuant to the settlement, the parties filed with the Court a stipulation to
retain jurisdiction pursuant to Code fo Civil Procedure section 664.6. 
 
As of the filing of the moving papers more than 60
days into calendar year 2024, Plaintiffs assert that Defendant Korzennik
remains at 26 Cinchring. The declaration of Jeffrey Lewis, counsel for
Plaintiffs, notes that on January 11, 2024, he received an email from
Defendant’s counsel indicating that she had not vacated 26 Cinchring.
(Declaration of Jeffrey Lewis (“Lewis Decl.”), ¶ 8.) As such, Plaintiffs have
brought this motion re: contempt for violation of the prior order on the parties’
settlement agreement.

IV. ANALYSIS¿¿ 
 
A.   
Legal Standard 
 
Civil Contempt procedures are set forth
in Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1209 through 1222. (See Allison v. County of
Ventura (1977) 68 Cal. App. 3d 689, 702.)  Under these rules, a
proceeding for adjudication of constructive contempt is customarily initiated
by the issuance of an Order to Show Cause.  (In re Rose (1949) 90
Cal. App. 2d 299, 305.)  The proceeding is also initiated by the filing of
an affidavit or declaration, stating the facts constituting the alleged
contempt, in order to confer jurisdiction upon the court to exercise its
contempt powers over the accused.  (In re Liu (1969) 273 Cal. App.
2d 135, 140-41.) 
 
Since a contempt proceeding is
quasi-criminal in nature, the accused person is entitled to due process, or the
procedural safeguards available to a person accused of a criminal charge,
including the right to know the exact nature of the charge against him/her so
that he/she can prepare and present his/her defense.  (Ibid. at
141.)  The accused must be shown, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he/she
had the ability to comply with the subject court order; the burden of proof on
this issue lies with the party seeking to have the accused held in
contempt.  (Ibid. at 141-42.) 
 
Contempt is any act, in or out of court,
“which tends to impede, embarrass or obstruct the court in the discharge of its
duties.”  (In re Shortridge (1893) 99 Cal. 526, 532.)  An
“indirect contempt” occurs out of court but is equally subject to the summary
punishment set forth in Code of Civil Procedure § 1211: “When the contempt is
not committed in the immediate view and presence of the court, or of the judge
at chambers, an affidavit shall be presented to the court or judge of the facts
constituting the contempt, or a statement of the facts by the referees or
arbitrators, or other judicial officers.”  (Arthur v. Sup.Ct. of Los
Angeles County (1965) 62 Cal.2d 404, 407-408.)  Thereafter, an order
to show cause must be issued and the court must hold a hearing on the
facts.  (Ibid. at 408.) Since the acts involved in the alleged
contempt in this action did not occur in the Court’s presence, the affidavit
must cover each element of the commission of the contempt.  (Code Civ
Proc. § 1211.5.)  If necessary, the court may order or permit amendment of
the affidavits at any stage of the proceedings.  (Code Civ. Proc. §
1211.5(b).)  
 
The elements of contempt are: (1) facts
establishing court’s jurisdiction (e.g., personal
service of subpoena,
validity of court order allegedly violated, etc.); (2) the party’s knowledge of
the order disobeyed; (3) the party’s ability to comply; and (4) the party’s
willful disobedience of the order.  (Koehler v. Superior Court
(2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 1153, 1169; In re Jones (1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 879,
881.)  
Furthermore, the order
must be personally served on the party to establish jurisdiction.  (Cedars-Sinai
Imaging Medical Group v. Superior Court, (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 1281.) 
 
 
B.   
Discussion 
 
Here, Plaintiffs assert that they have brought this motion
because as of January 11, 2024, counsel for Plaintiff received an email from
Defense counsel indicating that Defendant had not vacated her home, as required
by the parties’ settlement agreement that carried with it the imprimatur of the
Court’s December 13, 2023 order. Thus, Plaintiffs are seeking to enforce the liquidated
damages in $1,000 per day starting on January 2, 2023. 
 
In opposition, Defendant argues that she vacated her home prior
to Plaintiffs’ filing of this motion and thus, Plaintiffs did not meet their
burden for a contempt order. Defendant’s opposition notes that as of February
6, 2024, Defendant Korzennik no longer resides in her home at 26 Cinchring. Defendant
notes that Korzennik began the move out process, upon selecting a residential
room and board care home for elderly people that had availability by December
20, 2023, with good faith deposits for the accommodations made by December 31,
2023. However, Defendant notes the facility required medical and financial
assessments, reports from Korzennik’s physician and an assessment to be
conducted by the facility’s nurse, in addition to refurbishing the room. Defendant
asserts that these steps took the month of January 2024, resulting in the move out
beginning on February 2, 2024.  Korzennik
asserts she completed her move into her new home as of February 6, 2024. Defense
counsel notes that he advised Plaintiffs’ attorney, in the January 11, 2024
email that the move out would be completed, but because of what The Canterbury residential
care facilityneeded, it would not be completed until the end of January, but
forwarded to Plaintiffs’ attorney a payment of $1,000 for not meeting the
January 2, 2024 deadline, in addition to attorney’s fees of $2,500 as ordered
by the Court’s December 13, 2023 court order. 
 
Further, Defendant notes in the opposition papers that more than
a month after Korzennik moved out, Plaintiffs, on March 7, 2024, filed this
current motion for an order to show cause (OSC) for contempt. Defendant
highlights that Plaintiffs did not move for an order to enforce the settlement
agreement contract, or for statutory sanctions. Instead, Defendant argues that
Plaintiffs’ motion seeks an injunction, plus contractual damages, based on the
issuance of an OSC and contempt hearing. The Court is confused as to Defendant’s
arguments and discussion around Code of Civil Procedure section 1218 as Plaintiffs
have not moved under section 1218. 
 
As noted above, pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 1211.5, Plaintiffs were required to provide
an affidavit meeting all of the following elements of contempt: (1) facts
establishing court’s jurisdiction (e.g., personal
service of subpoena,
validity of court order allegedly violated, etc.); (2) the party’s knowledge of
the order disobeyed; (3) the party’s ability to comply; and (4) the party’s
willful disobedience of the order.  (Koehler v. Superior Court
(2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 1153, 1169; In re Jones (1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 879,
881.) Here, as noted in the Lewis
Declaration, the parties agreed that this Court would maintain jurisdiction
(Lewis Decl., ¶ 5.) Next, Defendant and Defense counsel were aware of the order
to move out by December 31, 2023 as defense counsel attended the December 13,
2023 order and as evidenced by the declarations from Defendant herself in
opposition to the Motion to Enforce Settlement. Third, the issue of the
Defendant’s ability to comply may be argued. Compliance with this Court’s order
did not hinge on whether Defendant was able to relocate to The Canterbury facility,
which Defendant has informed took a month or so to get into. The order required
Defendant to leave the home by December 31, 2023. As such, the issue of whether
Defendant should have stayed somewhere else while The Canterbury was approving
her is in question as to the ability to comply issue. 
 
Lastly, as to the willful violation issue, this Court notes that
Defendant argues she did not willfully violate the Court order as she and her
son took immediate steps to have her move out, but that the process took more
time than expected. Here, as the Court noted in the December 13, 2023 Minute Order,
it is not persuaded by the argument that Defendant be permitted to find a
suitable home before vacating the premises. In fact, the Court expressly stated
that even if into a temporary lodging circumstance, Plaintiff was to move out
pursuant to the binding and enforceable settlement agreement. Here, this Court
finds that even if Defendant was waiting for approval to move to The
Canterbury, she could have stayed in a hotel, a short-term Airbnb, with a
family member, etc. Failure to do so expressly violated the binding and
enforceable settlement agreement between the parties. 
 
As to the issue of contempt and Plaintiffs filing this after
Defendant had already moved out, Plaintiffs note in their reply brief that they
were not put on notice that Defendant had vacated the premises and that in
advance of this motion, which was served on February 15, 2024, the Plaintiffs
asked Defense counsel for specifics about whether, and what date Defendant
moved out. However, after receiving no answer about those specifics, Plaintiffs
contend that this motion was filed. In the interest of judicial efficiency,
this Court does not require Plaintiffs to file a separate motion to enforce
their settlement agreement again. Also, even if not for the move-out of
Defendant, the contempt hearing can also flow from the fact that this Court
ordered $1,000 in liquidated damages to be paid each day of Defendant’s
violation. The Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement that was GRANTED by this
Court included the parties’ fully-signed agreement to pay daily
liquidated damages of $1,000. As such, the parties both noting that on January
11, 2024, $1,000 was paid to Plaintiffs’ counsel is already a violation of the
Court order as by January 11, 2024, Defendant had already accrued $10,000 in
liquidated damages to be paid to the Plaintiffs for failure to move out sooner.

 
This Court will not enforce the liquidated damages clause, or impose
contempt sanctions for the violations for the months of September, October, and
November as requested for the first time in the reply brief. However, the Court
will allow oral argument as to the $1,000 per day breach since January 2,2024. The
Court’s tentative ruling is to GRANT the motion, either as an enforcement of the
parties’ settlement agreement or as a civil contempt, in the amount of $1,000 per
day for Defendant’s failure to move out by January 1, 2024 and liquidated
damages beginning on January 2, 2024. 
The tentative amount is $35,000 in liquidated damages between January 2,
2024 and February 6, 2024, less the $1,000 already paid. Defendant made an
economic decision, with the advice of counsel, to pay $1,000 per day for each
day she would not relinquish possession of the premises.  The Court’s tentative ruling is to enforce
this portion of the settlement agreement per the agreed upon terms, and was not
persuaded by Defendant’s argument that she must have located suitable alternative
living arrangements before moving out of 26 Cinchring Rd.  Because of the dollar amount involved, the Court
will entertain discussion of a payment plan or extension of time for Defendant
to make the sanctions / contempt / breach of settlement payment.  
 
Attorney’s
Fees
 
As for attorneys’ fees, counsel for Plaintiffs contends that
since the December 13, 2023 hearing, he has spent one hour drafting this motion
and declaration, and anticipates spending an additional one hour reviewing the
opposition and preparing a reply brief. He also contends that he plans to spend
three (3) hours to attend the hearing. As noted in the Court’s December 13,
2023 minute order, the Court finds that the amount of hours to attend the
hearing to be excessive and tentatively reduces the number of hours claimed
from 5 to 3.  The Court also tentatively reduces
Mr. Lewis’ hourly rate to $700. 3 times $700 is $2,100. As such, the Court
GRANTS attorneys fees in the lowered amount of $2,100 against Korzennik to be
paid to Plaintiffs’ counsel Mr. Lewis by May 9, 2024.
