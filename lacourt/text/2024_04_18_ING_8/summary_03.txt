And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Toshiko Nakamura, et al. v. Nourit Korzennik. The case involves a dispute over a settlement agreement, in which Korzennik was required to vacate the premises by December 31, 2023. However, Korzennik failed to comply with the agreement, and the Nakamura family brought a motion for contempt against Korzennik.

The court granted the motion and ordered Korzennik to pay $35,000 in liquidated damages, plus $2,100 in attorneys' fees. The court also ordered Korzennik to pay $1,000 per day in liquidated damages for each day she failed to vacate the premises, starting from January 2, 2024.

The court noted that Korzennik's failure to vacate the premises was a willful violation of the settlement agreement, and that she could have stayed in a hotel or temporary lodging while waiting for approval to move to her new home. The court also reduced the amount of attorneys' fees claimed by the Nakamura family's counsel, from $5 to $2,100.

The court will entertain discussion of a payment plan or extension of time for Korzennik to make the sanctions/contempt/breach of settlement payment.
