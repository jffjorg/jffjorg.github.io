 Case Number:  23CHCV01275    Hearing Date:   March 14, 2024    Dept:  F49 Dept. F49  Date: 3/14/24 Case  Name: Quezada v.  State  of CA, et al. Case # 23CHCV01275   LOS  ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT NORTH  VALLEY DISTRICT DEPARTMENT  F49    MARCH 14,  2024    MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL  Los Angeles Superior Court Case # 23CHCV01275    Motion  filed: 10/26/23   MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff’s counsel Jonathan C. Teller  of Wilshire Law Firm (“Counsel”)  RESPONDING PARTY: None  NOTICE: ok    RELIEF  REQUESTED: An  order relieving counsel Jonathan C. Teller as counsel for Plaintiff Jorge A.  Castellanos Quezada (“Plaintiff”)   TENTATIVE  RULING: The  motion is GRANTED.   BACKGROUND   This action stems from alleged injuries sustained by Plaintiff  on January 9, 2023, in which Plaintiff alleges that his injuries were due to  dangerous conditions of the public roads under Defendants’ control.     On May 1, 2023, Plaintiff filed this action against  Defendants State of California, County of Los Angeles, City of Los Angeles, and  Does 1 through 50 (collectively, “Defendants”), alleging the following causes  of action: (1) dangerous condition of public property, and (2) negligence (Gov.  Code §§ 815.2, 815.4, and 820 et seq.)   On June 23, 2023, Defendant City of Los Angeles filed its  Answer to the Complaint.    On June 30, 2023, Plaintiff filed a request to dismiss  Defendant County of Los Angeles only, which was entered on the same day. Subsequently,  on July 3, 2023, the Defendant State of California filed a Stipulation and  Proposed Order Re: Dismissal of the Defendant State of California (the  “proposed order”). The proposed order was granted on the same day.    On October 26, 2023, Plaintiff’s Counsel filed the instant  Motion to be Relieved as Counsel (the “Motion”).    No opposing papers have been received by the Court.    ANALYSIS The court may  order that an attorney be changed or substituted at any time before or after  judgment or final determination upon request by either client or attorney and  after notice from one to the other. (Code Civ. Proc. § 284, subd. (2).) “The  determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies  within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128,  1133.) An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial  Counsel Forms MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and  MC-053 (Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c),  (e).)             In  addition, California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 subsection (d) requires that  the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order be served on  the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case by personal  service, electronic service, or mail. If the notice is served by mail, it must  be accompanied by a declaration stating facts showing that either:             (A) The service address is the current residence or  business address of the client; or (B)  The service address is the last known residence or business address of the  client and the attorney has been unable to locate a more current address after  making reasonable efforts to do so within 30 days before the filing of the  motion to be relieved.               (Cal. Rules of  Court, rule 3.1362, subd. (1)(A) & (2).)   Plaintiff’s Counsel has filed Judicial Counsel Forms MC-051  and MC-052. Additionally, Counsel lodged Judicial Counsel Form MC-053 with the  Court. Counsel has provided a declaration stating that the Motion is  necessitated by a “breakdown in attorney-client relationship due to inability  to communicate with client.,” and “No longer able to see eye-to-eye with client  to effectively prosecute the action.” (MC-052, ¶ 1.)    The Court finds Counsel’s reasons for seeking relief to be satisfactory.  Counsel states in his declaration that the Motion was personally served at  Plaintiff’s current address. (Id., ¶ 2.) Counsel has also filed a copy  of the proof of service, demonstrating proper service on Plaintiff and Defendant  City of Los Angeles.   The next hearing scheduled for this action is a Case  Management Conference set for April 30, 2024, at 08:30 a.m. in Department F49  at 9425 Penfield Ave. Chatsworth, CA 91311. A trial has not yet been set.  (MC-053, ¶¶ 7, 9.)   Consequently, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Counsel’s Motion  to be Relieved as Counsel.   CONCLUSION   Plaintiff’s Counsel Jonathan C. Teller’s Motion to be  Relieved as Counsel is GRANTED.   Plaintiff’s Counsel is ordered to give notice.
