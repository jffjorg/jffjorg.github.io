And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion filed by Plaintiff's counsel, Jonathan C. Teller, to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Jorge A. Castellanos Quezada. The motion is based on a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship due to an inability to communicate with the client, and the counsel's inability to see eye-to-eye with the client to effectively prosecute the action. The judge finds the reasons for seeking relief to be satisfactory and grants the motion.
