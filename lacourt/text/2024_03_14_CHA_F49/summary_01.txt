And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has ruled on a motion to compel defendant PlayCore to provide further responses to special interrogatories. The judge granted the motion in part, compelling PlayCore to provide further responses to interrogatories Nos. 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 16, 17, 21, 30, and 31. The judge denied the motion in part, finding that PlayCore's responses to interrogatories Nos. 3, 4, 6, 11, 32, 33, 34, and 35 were sufficient.

The judge found that PlayCore's responses to the special interrogatories were evasive and incomplete, and that the plaintiff was entitled to further responses. The judge also denied the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions against PlayCore and its counsel.

The judge ordered PlayCore to provide supplemental responses to the special interrogatories Nos. 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 16, 17, 21, 30, and 31 within 15 days.
