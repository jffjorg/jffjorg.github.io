And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff's motion to tax costs. The motion was filed in response to Defendant's request for $977.36 in filing and motion fees, $175.41 in fees for electronic filing or service, and $7,301.42 in expert fees. The Plaintiff seeks to tax $6,375 in expert costs as fees for experts not ordered by the Court, $708.83 in messenger fees as unnecessary, and $142 in printing and copying costs as not allowed under the Code.

The Judge grants the motion to tax the expert fees, finding that they were not ordered by the Court and are therefore not recoverable. The Judge also grants the motion to tax the printing and copying costs, finding that they are not allowed under the Code.

However, the Judge denies the motion to tax the messenger fees, finding that they were reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation. The Judge notes that the Code permits documents to be served by email, but also recognizes that personal service was necessary for certain documents in this case.

The Judge awards costs to the Defendants in the amount of $708.83.
