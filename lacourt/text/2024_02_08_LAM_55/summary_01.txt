And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the motion filed by Defendants L For Lofts, LLC and Wilfred Yang to consolidate cases 22STCV17848 and 23AHCV01671. The court has previously exercised its discretion to order that the two cases are not related, citing California Rules of Court and Local Rules. Because the cases are not related, no authority exists to consolidate them, and the court will not grant the motion.
