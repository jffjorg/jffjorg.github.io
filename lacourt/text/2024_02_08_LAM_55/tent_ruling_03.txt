 Case Number:  23STCV05253    Hearing Date:   February 8, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  Defendant Hun Yong Choe’s Motion for Order
Compelling Plaintiff Johnny Pham to Further Respond and Produce Documents for
Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, with Request for Sanctions.  Defendant Hun Yong Choe’s Motion for Order
Compelling Plaintiff Mika Yamamori to Further Respond and Produce Documents for
Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, with Request for Sanctions.
Both motions are granted.
On or before 3/15/24, each plaintiff shall serve
further responses, and produce documents, without objections, and in full
compliance with the California Discovery Act, CCP §2016.010 et seq., as
to the requests for production of documents served by moving party Defendant
Hun Yong Choe.
On or before that same date, Plaintiff JOHNNY PHAM and
Plaintiff MIKA YAMAMORI each shall pay discovery sanctions in the requested and
uncontested sum of $3,610.00 to Defendant HUN YONG CHOE.  E.g., CCP  
§ 2023.030. 
 
 
 
In this case, MIKA YAMAMORI and JOHNNY PHAM (“Plaintiffs”),
as self-represented litigants, allege wage and hour violations against ADC
ENERGY, INC.; BOLTIER R& D, INC.; HUN YONG CHOE; ARNE LIST; ROB DICKERSON; JAMES
STEWART; and BRIAN WING (“Defendants).    
In September 2023, Defendant HUN YONG CHOE (“Defendant
Choe”) filed motions to compel Plaintiffs’ further responses to Defendant Choe’s
document requests, and imposing $3,610.00 in sanctions against Plaintiff JOHNNY
PHAM, and $3,610 against Plaintiff MIKA YAMAMORI. At the case management
conference on 1/11/2024, the Court scheduled an Informal Discovery Conference
with the parties to take place on 1/22/2024 for the purpose of discussing the
issues in Defendant Choe’s motions and hopefully resolving those issues.
Defendant Choe’s counsel appeared for the IDC but
neither Plaintiff appeared. Plaintiffs’ no-show violated the Court’s order
setting the IDC and wasted an opportunity to resolve the issues in the motions informally.
As a result, Defendant Choe’s motions remained on the calendar for hearing. 
The Court agrees with Defendant Choe that Plaintiffs’ responses
are not code-compliant. The responses do not make clear what part of the
documents will be produced and what part will be withheld due to inability to
produce or discovery objections.  Further,
such responses could not support another motion to compel documents as agreed,
because there was no statement as to what Plaintiffs “will” produce. Specifically,
the responses state what Plaintiffs “could” produce, whereas the Discovery Act
requires responses stating what they “will” produce in whole or part, the
reasons for inability to produce, and descriptions of documents withheld
pursuant to objections. CCP §§2031.210(a), 2031.220, 2031.270, 2031.280.
Plaintiffs’ opposition does not address Defendant Choe’s
contention that Plaintiffs waived their objections by serving untimely
responses. Nor do Plaintiffs oppose the amount of sanctions sought by Defendant
Choe. Complete silence in an opposition to a motion, as to an issue, results in a waiver the right to
argue the matter in trial court and on appeal. 
Assad v. Southern Pacific Transportation Co.  (1996) 42
Cal.App.4th 1609, 1615.  Ordinarily,
appellate courts will not consider arguments, authority, and facts that were
not presented in the trial court, and those are deemed to be waived.  Bank of America, N.A. v. Roberts
(2013) 217 Cal. App. 4th 1386, 1398-99; In re Marriage of Falcone and Fyke  (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 814, 826
The Court therefore grants the motions including
sanctions, the Court finding an absence of substantial justification for
advocating the sufficiency of noncompliant responses.
