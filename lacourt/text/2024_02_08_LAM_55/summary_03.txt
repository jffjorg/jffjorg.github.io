And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Judge has granted Defendant Hun Yong Choe's motions to compel further responses and produce documents from Plaintiffs Johnny Pham and Mika Yamamori. The Judge finds that Plaintiffs' previous responses were not code-compliant and did not provide clear information about which documents would be produced and which would be withheld. The Judge also finds that Plaintiffs' failure to appear at the Informal Discovery Conference wasted an opportunity to resolve the issues informally. As a result, the Judge is granting the motions, including sanctions against Plaintiffs in the amount of $3,610.00 each. The Judge notes that Plaintiffs' opposition to the motions did not address Defendant Choe's contention that Plaintiffs waived their objections by serving untimely responses, and that Plaintiffs did not oppose the amount of sanctions sought by Defendant Choe. The Judge also notes that the failure to address these issues in the opposition resulted in a waiver of the right to argue these issues on appeal.
