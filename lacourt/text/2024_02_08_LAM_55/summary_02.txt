And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling in a case where the defendant, Pacific Specialty Insurance Company, moves to compel the plaintiff, Manuk Pashanyan, to provide complete responses to requests for production of documents and things. The defendant served the requests on May 16, 2023, but the plaintiff did not serve timely responses. In fact, the plaintiff did not serve responses until January 24, 2024, after the defendant filed a motion to compel. The plaintiff's responses are deficient and do not substantially comply with the California Code of Civil Procedure. The Court finds no substantial justification for the plaintiff's late and deficient responses and grants the motion and request for sanctions. The plaintiff must serve further written responses and produce documents without objections by February 21, 2024, and pay $1,410.00 in sanctions to the defendant by the same date.
