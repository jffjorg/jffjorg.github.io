 Case Number:  23AHCV02146    Hearing Date:   April 16, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE]
ORDER OVERRULING DEMURRER TO THE SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION AND DENYING MOTION TO
STRIKE I.        INTRODUCTION          In this breach of contract action, Plaintiff San Van High
Technology Co. (San Van) alleges that it entered a contract with Defendants
Tians LLC, Cahm LLC, Cayg LLC, Jack Gu, Jing Chen, Diamond Ridge Corp. and JL
Capital Resources Inc. for the purchase of real property at 14814 Castle Butte
Rd., North Edwards, California 93523. San Van alleges that the purchase
included the business defendants ran at the property, defendants’ Industrial
Hemp Cultivation License and three separate APNs: 23348030005, 23348029003,
23348005003. It is alleged that Defendants retained Plaintiff’s initial deposit
of $700,000 after the purchase fell apart.          The complaint contains ten causes of action: (1) breach of
contract, (2) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,
(3) unjust enrichment, (4) conversion, (5) negligence/professional malpractice,
(6) breach of fiduciary duty, (7) common count- open book account, (8) common
count- money had and received, (9) common count-money paid, laid out and
expended, (10) common count-mistaken receipt.           Defendants Diamond Ridge Corp. dba Re/Max Champions (Re/Max
Champions) and Jing Chen (collectively Defendants) filed the instant demurrer
and motion to strike on November 3, 2023. Plaintiff filed opposition to the
demurrer and motion to strike on April 3, 2024. Defendants filed a reply on
April 9, 2024.Before
the Court are Defendants’ challenge to the sixth cause of action for breach of
fiduciary duty. Defendants allege that the sixth cause of action fails as the
facts alleged amount to negligence. The demurrer is overruled. The motion to
strike is denied. II.      DEMURRERA. Legal StandardCode
Civ. Proc. Section 430.10(e) provides for a demurrer on the basis that a
complaint fails to state a cause of action. (CCP § 430.10(e).) A demurrer tests
the legal sufficiency of a complaint. (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  A demurrer is treated as “admitting all
material facts properly pleaded,” but not the truth of “contentions, deductions
or conclusions of law.” (Aubry v. Tri-Defendants Hospital Dist. (1992) 2
Cal.4th 962, 966-967.) The general rule on demurrer is that the pleadings are
“deemed to be true, however improbable they may be.” (Del E. Webb Corp. v.
Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.4th 593, 604.) Questions
of plaintiff’s ability to prove unlikely allegations are of no concern. (Committee
on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197,
213-214.)Allegations
need not be accepted as true if they are contradicted by judicially noticeable
facts. (Cansino v. Bank of America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1462,
1474.) “We
treat the demurrer as admitting all the properly pleaded material facts and
consider matters which may be judicially noticed, but we do not treat as
admitted contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law. (Align
Technology, Inc. v. Tran (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 949, 958 [102 Cal.Rptr.3d
343].) Further, ‘ “ ‘we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading
it as a whole and its parts in their context.’ ”’ (Ibid.) Because a
demurrer tests only the legal sufficiency of the pleading, we accept as true
even the most improbable alleged facts, and we do not concern ourselves with
the plaintiff's ability to prove its factual allegations. (Ibid.)
‘“Facts appearing in exhibits attached to the first amended complaint also are
accepted as true and are given precedence, to the extent they contradict the
allegations.”’ (Paul v. Patton (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 1088, 1091.)
Although a demurrer does not ordinarily reach affirmative defenses, it ‘“will
lie where the complaint ‘has included allegations that clearly disclose some
defense or bar to recovery.’ ”’ (Casterson v. Superior Court (2002) 101
Cal.App.4th 177, 183, Nolte v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (2015) 236
Cal.App.4th 1401, 1406. )          B. Meet and Confer Requirement Met          The Declaration of Penelope M. Deihl is offered in support
of counsel’s compliance with Code Civ. Proc. Section 430.41. Deihl declares
that she met and conferred with Plaintiff’s counsel. (Deihl Decl. ¶¶ 2, 3,
referencing Exh. A.) Deihl’s
meet and confer letter sent on October 9, 2023 discusses the substantive issues
presented on demurrer. Consequently, the meet and confer requirement has been
met.           C. Demurrer to the Sixth Cause of Action for Breach of
Fiduciary Duty“ ‘The elements of a
claim for breach of fiduciary duty
are (1) the existence of a fiduciary relationship, (2) its breach, and (3)
damage proximately caused by that breach.’ (Citation.)” (O’Neal v.
Stanislaus County Employees’ Retirement System (2017) 8 Cal.App.5th 1184,
1215.) A claim for breach of fiduciary duty is distinct from a
claim for professional negligence. (Buehler v. Sbardellati (1995) 34 Cal.App.4th
1527, 1544 fn. 9, internal citations omitted [“there is authority for the view
the breach of fiduciary duty theory is separate from the professional
negligence theory”].) Here, ¶¶ 82 and 83 allege that Defendant Chen was
Plaintiff’s real estate agent and Defendant Re/Max Champions was Plaintiff’s
real estate broker, and in that capacity, they owed Plaintiff fiduciary duties.
(Complaint ¶¶ 82, 83.) ¶¶ 85 and 86 of the Complaint alleges that Chen and
Re/Max breached their fiduciary duties by using the wrong contract form, not
advising Plaintiff to retain an attorney, instructing Plaintiff to pay the
$700,000 deposit and failing to cancel the purchase agreement. (Complaint ¶¶ 85,
86.) ¶ 88 provides that Plaintiff did not consent and was damaged as a result.
(¶¶ 88,89.) However, these allegations are similar to those in the fifth cause
of action for professional negligence. (Complaint ¶¶ 75-80.) Defendants allege
that these allegations are also contradicted by the purchase agreement, which
is attached to the complaint and judicially noticeable. (See Complain Exh. A.)In its opposition, Plaintiff urges that it may
allege a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty on the same allegations
as the professional negligence cause of action. (See Thomson v. Canyon
(2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 594, 605.) Plaintiff also cites that real estate
professionals, ReMax Champions and Chen, owe fiduciary duties. (See Civil Code
§ 2322(c).) However, this code section provides the duties of agents in general,
not real estate professionals. Plaintiff cites case law referencing the
fiduciary duties of real estate agents and brokers. (See Thomson v. Canyon
(2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 594, 607; Ryan v. Real Estate of the Pacific (2019), 32
Cal. App. 5th 637, 646, internal citations omitted.)There is no authority cited for the proposed
higher pleading standard for breach of fiduciary duties. (See Opposition p. 2:
13-16.)At this time, the Court declines to conclude
whether the allegations as pleaded are professional negligence or breach of
fiduciary duty, as that is a finding of fact not appropriate at the demurrer
stage. (See Reply p. 3: 6-7.) The
demurrer to the sixth cause of action is overruled. III.     MOTION
TO STRIKE           A.
Legal Standard          Code Civ. Proc. §436 provides: “The court may, upon a motion
made pursuant to Section 435, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms
it deems proper:(a) Strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading.(b) Strike out all or any
part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this
state, a court rule, or an order of the court.”                 B.
Motion to Strike is DeniedThe Defendants
seek to strike the following sections of the Complaint: “For attorneys’ fees."
(Complaint p. 17: 15.)CCP Section 1033.5 allows for the recovery of
attorney fees if authorized by contract, statute or law. (CCP § 1033.5(a)(10).)
Defendants urge that Plaintiff’s counsel “has agreed to stipulate that there is
no contractual basis for the request for attorneys’ fees.” (Motion to Strike,
p. 4 fn 1.) In its opposition, Plaintiff does not agree that its counsel stipulated
that there was no basis for attorney fees. (See Opposition p. 2 fn. 1.)In its
opposition, Plaintiff urges that attorney fees are appropriate as the real
estate sale agreement between Plaintiff and Defendants Tians, Cahm and Cayg
provides for attorney fees. (See Complaint Exh. A.) As attorney fees are
appropriate under the Sale Agreement against the non-demurring defendants, the
Court declines to strike the prayer for attorney fees.Plaintiff
also urges that the tort of another doctrine allows for attorney fees against
Defendants Re/Max Champions and Chen. The tort of another doctrine “allows a
plaintiff attorney fees if he is required to employ counsel to prosecute or
defend an action against a third party because of the tort of the
defendant.” (Gray v. Don Miller & Assoc., Inc. (1984) 35 Cal.3d 498,
505, emphasis added.) Plaintiff urges that it was forced to sue
Seller-Defendants Tians LLC, Cahm LLC and Cayg LLC due to Real
Estate-Defendants Re/Max Champions and Jing Chen’s conduct. In
their reply, Defendants urge that the tort of another doctrine does not apply
as the suit against the Seller-Defendants arises out of their retention of
Plaintiff’s deposit, not out  of
Real-Estate Defendant’s alleged negligence. (Complaint ¶¶ 28-29, 49.) The Court
agrees and finds that the tort of another doctrine does not provide for
attorney fees against Defendants Re/Max Champions and Jing Chen.The Court
denies the motion to strike attorney fees. IV.     CONCLUSION
AND ORDER Defendants’ demurrer to the sixth cause of
action is overruled. The motion to strike is denied.          Counsel for Plaintiff to give notice of this order.          Dated:  April 15, 2024                                      _______________________________                                                                                  JARED D.
