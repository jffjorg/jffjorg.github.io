And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants two separate motions: one for Admiral Insurance Co. to intervene in the lawsuit and file a cross-complaint, and one for Floor Technology Group to amend its complaint to add a new cause of action.

Admiral Insurance Co. is seeking to intervene in the lawsuit because it has a financial interest in the outcome, having spent over $100,000 defending Jokake Construction Services, Inc. in an arbitration proceeding. The court finds that Admiral's interest is not adequately represented by the existing parties and grants the motion to intervene.

Floor Technology Group is seeking to add a new cause of action to its complaint, alleging that Jokake breached a contract and seeking damages. The court grants the motion to amend, finding that the delay in seeking amendment was not prejudicial to the opposing party.

The court orders Admiral Insurance Co. to file and serve its proposed cross-complaint within 30 days, and orders Floor Technology Group to file and serve its second amended complaint within 30 days.
