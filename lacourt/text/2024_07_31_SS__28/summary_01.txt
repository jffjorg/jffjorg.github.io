And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the papers filed in this case and has ruled that the motion to enforce a settlement agreement is denied without prejudice. The plaintiff, James Michael Quintana, had filed a motion to enforce a settlement agreement with the defendant, Ngam Ratsamy, and his insurers, Allstate Northbrook Indemnity Company and United States Liability Insurance Company. The settlement agreement was executed on April 10, 2024, and provided for the payment of $500,000.00 to the plaintiff, with $250,000.00 paid by USLIC on May 6, 2024. However, the settlement agreement does not specify a deadline for payment, and the court cannot create a new material term by ordering a deadline for payment. The court recommends that the defendant make the remaining payment of $250,000.00 within 60 days, and if the payment is not made, the plaintiff may renew his motion. The motion is denied without prejudice.
