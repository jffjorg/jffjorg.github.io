 Case Number:  22STCV27823    Hearing Date:   July 31, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
August 26, 2022, Plaintiffs Victor Manuel Perez, Veronica Esther Perez, Mason
Manuel Perez, a minor by and through his guardian ad litem Veronica Esther
Perez, and Jaxon Andy Perez, a minor by and through his guardian ad litem
Veronica Esther Perez, filed this action against Defendants Andrea Michelle
Sidman and Does 1-50 for motor vehicle tort and general negligence. 
On
February 1, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a notice of settlement. 
On June
28, 2024, Petitioner Veronica Perez (“Petitioner”) filed a petition to approve
the compromise of minor Plaintiff Mason Perez’s claims. 
PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
asks the Court to approve the compromise of the pending action of Plaintiff
Mason Perez. 
DISCUSSION 
The
new petition, like the previous petition (filed May 2, 2024), contains the
following information about the proposed settlement: 
Gross
settlement amount: $8,000.00 Total
medical expenses: $25,588.36 Reductions:
$20,198.00 Payment/reimbursement
from proceeds: $2,941.49 Attorney’s
fees: $2,000.00 Non-medical
costs: $273.50 Net
balance: $2,785.01
As
the Court noted in its June 14, 2024 order, Section 12a(1) of the petition
states that total medical expenses were $25,588.36. Section 12a(3) of the
petition states that this amount was reduced by $20,198.00 as the result of
negotiated, contractual, and statutory reductions. This should mean that the
remaining $5,390.36 will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.
However, Section 12a(4) of the petition states that only $2,941.49 of the
medical expenses will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. As a
result, $2,448.87 of the medical expenses are unaccounted for. 
In
response to this analysis, Petitioner states:  “The Court has not taken into consideration
the medical expenses paid by private insurance, [Medi-Cal]
or Medicare in the amount of $2448.87 to be added to the settlement
information on number 2 above (please refer to page number 12a(2) of the
Petition for Approval of Minor's Compromise). Therefore, the amount of $2448.87
is accounted for in the Petition for Approval of Minor's Compromise.”  (Declaration of Haleh Shekarchian ¶ 3.) 
The
only information Petitioner has provided about “medical expenses paid by
private insurance, [Medi-Cal] or Medicare” is a letter from the Department of
Health Care Services stating that Medi-Cal paid $659.96 of Plaintiff’s medical
expenses and has agreed to accept $494.97 as reimbursement.  Petitioner has provided no information about (1)
additional payments of medical expenses by private insurance or Medicare or (2) information showing
that private insurance or Medicare have either waived their right to
reimbursement for these payments or have agreed to accept a reduced amount as
reimbursement.  (See Sections 12b(2),
12b(3).)  Therefore, Petitioner’s bare
assertion in Section 12a(2) that private medical insurance, Medi-Cal, and
Medicare paid $2,448.87 of Plaintiff’s medical expenses does not address the
Court’s concern. 
As
the Court previously noted, the Court cannot grant a petition to approve a
minor’s compromise unless it shows that all medical expenses that have not been
waived or reduced will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. The
Court denies the petition without prejudice. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice the petition to approve the compromise of minor
Plaintiff Mason Perez’s action filed by Petitioner Veronica Perez on June 28,
2024. 
Petitioner
is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within
five days.
