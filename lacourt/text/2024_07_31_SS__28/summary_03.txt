Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the petition to approve the compromise of minor Plaintiff Mason Perez's claims and has denied it without prejudice. The petition states that the total medical expenses are $25,588.36, but only $2,941.49 of these expenses will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. The Court notes that this leaves $2,448.87 of medical expenses unaccounted for. The Petitioner claims that this amount was paid by private insurance, Medi-Cal, or Medicare, but the Petitioner has not provided sufficient information to support this claim. The Court cannot grant the petition unless it shows that all medical expenses that have not been waived or reduced will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. Therefore, the petition is denied without prejudice, and the Petitioner is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within five days.
