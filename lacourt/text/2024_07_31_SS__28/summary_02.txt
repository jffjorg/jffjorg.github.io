The Judge's tentative ruling is a summary of the case and the arguments presented by the parties. The case involves a lawsuit filed by Kamo Martirosyan against Monteverde Ranch, LLC, Monteverde Ranch Equestrian Center, LLC, and Does 1-100 for general negligence, gross negligence, and/or recklessness, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and exemplary damages.

The Judge reviews the papers filed by the parties and rules on the demurrer filed by Monteverde Ranch, LLC. The demurrer argues that the plaintiff's claims for gross negligence and general negligence should be dismissed. The Judge finds that the complaint alleges facts that show an extreme departure from the ordinary standard of care and reckless conduct that increased the risk inherent in the sport of horseback riding.

The Judge overrules the demurrer and allows the plaintiff's claims to proceed. The Judge orders Monteverde Ranch, LLC to file an answer to the first amended complaint within 10 days and requires the moving party to give notice of the ruling and file proof of service with the Court within five days.
