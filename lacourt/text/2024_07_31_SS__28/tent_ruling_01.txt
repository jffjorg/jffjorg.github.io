  Case Number:  21STCV10129    Hearing Date:   July 31, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
March 15, 2021, Plaintiff James Michael Quintana (“Plaintiff”) filed this
action against Defendants Ngam Ratsamy (“Defendant”) and Does 1-50 for motor
vehicle tort and general negligence. 
On
September 15, 2021, Defendant filed an answer. 
On
January 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed a notice of conditional settlement. 
On
July 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section
664.6 for an order and entry of judgment enforcing the terms of a settlement
agreement.  The motion was set for hearing
on July 31, 2024.  Defendant has not
filed an opposition. 
PARTY’S REQUESTS 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to enforce a settlement agreement and award interest, costs, and
attorney’s fees. 
LEGAL STANDARD                   
Code
of Civil Procedure section 664.6 provides in part: 
“(a) If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a
writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If
requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to
enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement. 
“(b) For purposes of this section, a writing is signed
by a party if it is signed by any of the following: 
“(1) The party. 
“(2) An attorney who represents the party. 
“(3) If the party is an insurer, an agent who is
authorized in writing by the insurer to sign on the insurer’s behalf.” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subds. (a), (b).) 
In
deciding motions made under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6, courts “must
determine whether the parties entered into a valid and binding
settlement.”  (Kohn v. Jaymar-Ruby
(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1530, 1533.)  On a
motion to enforce a settlement under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6,
courts have the power to decide disputed facts and to interpret the
agreement.  (Fiore v. Alvord
(1985) 182 Cal.App.3d 561, 566; L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide:
Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶¶ 12:977–12:978.5, pp. 12(ll)-139
to 12(ll)-140.) Courts may receive evidence, determine disputed facts including
the terms the parties previously agreed on, and enter the terms of a settlement
agreement as a judgment, but they may not create new material terms. (Osumi
v. Sutton (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 1355, 1360.) 
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff
asserts that on January 11, 2024, the parties settled the case at a private
mediation.  Under the settlement, Defendant's insurers Allstate
Northbrook Indemnity Company (“Allstate”) would pay Plaintiff $250,000.00 and
United States Liability Insurance Company (“USLIC”) would pay Plaintiff $250,000.00,
for a total gross settlement amount of $500,000.00.  On April 10, 2024, the parties executed the written settlement
agreement. 
On
May 6, 2024, Plaintiff received a check for $250,000.00 from USLIC.  He asks the Court to enforce the settlement
agreement and order Defendant to pay him the remaining $250,000.00. 
The
settlement agreement states that Allstate and USLIC will pay Plaintiff “after
the execution of [the settlement agreement].” 
The settlement agreement does not specify a deadline for payment. 
Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6, the Court may enter judgment “pursuant
to the terms of the settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (a).)  The settlement here, however, contains no terms requiring Defendant to pay the entire settlement amount by a particular
date.  Accordingly, a Court order to pay the remaining settlement amount would not enforce a term of the settlement but
would instead create a new material term (a deadline for payment), which the Court may not do. 
This
is not to say that Defendant may delay payment of the remaining settlement
amount indefinitely.  The Court expects
Defendant and/or his insurers to make the remaining payment within 60 days of
the date of this ruling.  If Plaintiff
does not receive the remaining settlement amount within 60 days, Plaintiff may
renew his motion. 
The
Court denies the motion without prejudice. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice Plaintiff James Michael Quintana’s motion under
Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 for an order and entry of judgment
enforcing the terms of a settlement agreement. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
