And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a court case between American Contractors Indemnity Company (ACIC) and Victor Granados, et al. ACIC is seeking an order to assign payments made to Granados to themselves, as well as a restraining order to prevent Granados from assigning or disposing of these payments. They are also seeking an accounting to monitor Granados' activity and ensure compliance with the court's orders.

The judge has granted ACIC's motion solely with respect to payments made to Granados. Granados is required to file and serve a proposed order in accordance with this ruling within 20 days. The judge has denied ACIC's motion with respect to payments made to Vic 1 Construction, as it does not demonstrate under what legal authority these payments should be assigned or turned over to ACIC.

The judge has found that ACIC's motion is warranted under law, based on evidence that Granados consistently receives payments from JCE Buildings and Development, Inc. and Wilsey Gopp, LLC, which he endorses and deposits into his personal bank account.
