And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion to reopen discovery, continue the trial date, and pretrial deadlines. The trial date is continued to April 24, 2024, at 8:30 am in department 26. The defendants' request for sanctions is denied. The ruling is based on the Court's discretion to extend or reopen discovery under Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050, and the defendants' argument that they are still seeking responses to discovery regarding the plaintiffs' damages. The Court finds that reopening discovery will not interfere with the trial date and will not cause prejudice to the plaintiffs.
