And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Judgment Debtor Robert Anthony Cornell's Motion to Vacate Sister-State Judgment. The motion was filed on August 8, 2023, in response to a sister-state judgment entered against him and his companies in the amount of $16,996.18. The Judge found that Judgment Debtor Cornell failed to provide sufficient evidence to prove that service of process in the sister-state action was defective or that the judgment creditor failed to acquire jurisdiction in the State of New York. The Judge also rejected Judgment Debtor Cornell's arguments that the judgment was invalid due to alleged errors in the loan agreement and lack of a declaration from an independent attorney. The Court has denied the motion and the Clerk is to give notice.
