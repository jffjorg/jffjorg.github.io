The judge grants State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company's motion to enforce a settlement agreement with Elyssa Mellen. The settlement agreement, signed by both parties and their attorneys, provides for payments by Mellen to State Farm in the amount of $11,798.11, with a default provision that allows State Farm to seek judgment for the unpaid balance and costs if Mellen defaults. Mellen did default on the payments, and State Farm is entitled to judgment in the amount of $8,323.11 principal and $500.00 costs. The court will enter judgment in favor of State Farm and against Mellen.
