ANALYSIS: 
 
On
August 1, 2019, Plaintiffs Antonio Cabral and Patricia Cabral (“Plaintiffs”)
filed this action for trespass, trespass to chattles, and conversion against
Defendant Carlos M. Quintana (“Defendant Quintana”). Plaintiffs filed a First
Amended Complaint on March 5, 2020 adding Quint Tax Services Corporation (“Defendant
Quint”) as a defendant, and causes of action for nuisance and negligence.
Defendant Quint filed an answer and Cross-Complaint on March 11, 2021. A First
Amended Cross-Complaint was filed against Plaintiffs and Rise Again Printing,
LLC on September 24, 2021. 
 
On
February 9, 2022, the Court set a trial date of September 11, 2023. Plaintiffs
filed a motion to reclassify the action to the limited jurisdiction court on
July 28, 2023.  On August 23, 2023, the Court granted the motion to
reclassify and the case was reassigned to the limited jurisdiction court on
August 31, 2023. (Notice of Case Reassignment, 08/31/23.) On October 2, 2023,
the Court continued the trial date but did not reopen the cutoffs for discovery
or discovery motions. (Minute Order, 10/02/23.) On the same date, Defendants
filed and served the instant Motion to Reopen Discovery, and Continue Trial and
Pretrial Deadlines. Plaintiff filed an opposing declaration on January 10,
2024.
 
Discussion
 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 2024.050 allows the Court to extend or reopen discovery
at its discretion. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.050, subd. (b)) In determining
whether to grant such relief, the Court should consider (1) the necessity and
the reasons for the discovery; (2) the diligence or lack of diligence of the
party seeking the discovery or the hearing of a discovery motion, and the
reasons that the discovery was not completed or that the discovery motion was
not heard earlier; (3) any likelihood that permitting the discovery or hearing
the discovery motion will prevent the case from going to trial on the date set,
or otherwise interfere with the trial calendar, or result in prejudice to any
other party; and (4) the length of time that has elapsed between any date
previously set, and the date presently set, for the trial of the action.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.050, subd. (b).)
 
Defendants
contend they are still seeking responses to discovery regarding Plaintiff’s
damages. (Motion, Jackson Decl., ¶¶5, 11-12, 16.) Following numerous meet and
confer efforts with Plaintiffs’ counsel to obtain substantive discovery
responses from July to September 2023, defense counsel learned in late
September 2023 that the initial discovery deadline had closed. (Id. at
¶¶5, 11-12, 16-17.) Defendants promptly filed the instant Motion on October 2,
2023 and contend they will be prejudiced if discovery is not reopened.
Defendants then make a confusing argument that reopening discovery will not
interfere with the trial date because there is no set trial date and Plaintiffs
have stipulated to continue the trial date. First, Defendants are mistaken that
there is no trial date. Trial is set for March 4, 2024. Also, if there is no
trial date, why is the Motion styled as one to Reopen Discovery and Continue
Trial and Pretrial Deadlines? 
 
Finally,
Defendants request sanctions under two different statutes. First, under Code of
Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (c), which states: “The court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (c).) This is not a motion to compel responses to
interrogatories and there is no indication that Plaintiffs unsuccessfully made
or opposed such a motion. Likewise, a request for sanctions under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2024.050 is only proper “against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to extend or to reopen
discovery.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.050, subd. (c).) There is no opposition by
Plaintiffs to the instant Motion except to the request for sanctions. Therefore,
the request for sanctions is denied. 
 
Conclusion 
 
Defendants Quint Tax
Services Corp. and Carlos M. Quintana’s Motion to Reopen Discovery, Continue
Trial, and Pretrial Dates is GRANTED. TRIAL IS CONTINUED TO APRIL 24, 2024 AT
8:30 AM IN DEPARTMENT WITH DISCOVERY AND MOTION CUTOFFS TO FOLLOW THE NEW TRIAL
DATE. DEFENDANTS’ REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS IS DENIED.
