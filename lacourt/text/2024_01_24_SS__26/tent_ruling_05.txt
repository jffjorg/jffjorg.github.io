ANALYSIS:
 
On April 12, 2023, Defendant Cynthya Orozco (“Defendant
Orozco”) served Special Interrogatories, Set One and Request for Production of
Documents, Set One, on Plaintiff Maria Ortez (“Plaintiff Maria”). (Motions, Lamming Decl., Exh. A.) Despite a meet
and confer effort extending the deadline to serve verified responses without
objections, Plaintiff Maria has not served responses to the discovery. (Id.
at ¶¶3-6 and Exh. B.) Defendant Orozco filed the instant (1) Motion to Compel Responses
to Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions; and (2) Motion
to Compel Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, and
Request for Sanctions on December 22, 2023. No oppositions have been filed to
date. 
 
There is no requirement for a prior
meet and confer effort before a motion to compel initial responses can be
filed. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.) Further, the motion can be
brought at any time after the responding party fails to provide the responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.)
Based on Plaintiff Maria’s failure to timely respond to the propounded
discovery, Defendant Orozco is entitled to an order compelling service of
verified responses to the discovery requests without objections. 
 
Plaintiff Maria’s
failure to timely respond constitutes a misuse of the discovery process. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) Sanctions are appropriate under Code of
Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 and have been properly noticed.
However, the amount sought is excessive for a simple and unopposed motion.
Pursuant to a lodestar calculation, sanctions are awarded against Plaintiff
Maria in the amount of $370.00 based on two hours of attorney time billed at
$125.00 per hour and filing fees of $60.00 per motion. (Motion, Lamming Decl., ¶7.) 

 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Cynthya Orozco’s (1) Motion to Compel Responses to
Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions; and (2) Motion to
Compel Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, and Request
for Sanctions, are GRANTED. PLAINTIFF MARIA ORTEZ IS TO SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES TO SPECIAL
INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE, AND REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS, SET ONE, WITHOUT
OBJECTIONS, WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER. PLAINTIFF MARIA ORTEZ IS
ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $370.00 TO DEFENSE
COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
