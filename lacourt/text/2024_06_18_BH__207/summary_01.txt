And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's second cause of action for fraud. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's allegations lacked specificity and that the plaintiff failed to plead damages stemming from the alleged fraud. The judge found that the plaintiff's complaint adequately pleaded the elements of fraud, including the who, what, when, and how of the alleged fraudulent misrepresentation. The judge also found that the plaintiff had alleged a prima facie case for fraud against the defendant. The judge ordered the defendant to file and serve an answer to the complaint on or before July 9, 2024.
