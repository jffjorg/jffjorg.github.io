[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:
 
PLAINTIFF’S
  REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT 
 



 
Plaintiff Shuwen Li (“Plaintiff”) requests entry of default judgment against Defendant Solomon
Demeku (“Defendant”). Plaintiff seeks judgment in the
total amount of $50,803.95, comprising
$50,000.00 in damages and $803.95 in costs. 

The Court notes a few defects with the submitted default
judgment package. 
First, Item
6(b) of the request for court judgment (Form CIV-100) is checked. However,
Items 6(b)(1)-(2) are blank. No date of mailing, name(s), or addresse(s) are
specified. In addition, below Item 6 of the request for court judgment, a
declarant’s name is listed, but no signature is provided.
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
587, “[a]n application by a plaintiff
for entry of default under subdivision (a), (b), or (c) of Section 585 or Section 586
shall include an affidavit stating that a copy of the application has been
mailed to the defendant’s attorney of record or, if none, to the defendant at
his or her last known address and the date on which the copy was mailed. If no
such address of the defendant is known to the plaintiff or plaintiff’s
attorney, the affidavit shall state that fact. No default under subdivision
(a), (b), or (c) of Section 585 or Section 586 shall be entered, unless the affidavit is
filed. The nonreceipt of the notice shall not invalidate or constitute ground
for setting aside any judgment.” 
Second, the supporting Declaration of Shuwen Li provides, inter alia,
that “[a]s the owner of the residence at 24321 Barley Dr., Moreno
Valley, CA, on August 1, 2017, I rented the residence to four college students:
Defendants Timothy Pojim, Yonatan Daniel, Solomon Demeku, and Dajohn Wade for
$4,550 per month ($2,150 for one tenant and $800 each for the additional three
tenants) through July 31, 2018 [true copy, Lease, see par. 1, 4].” (Li Decl., ¶
1.) However, the “Residential Lease/Rental Agreement” attached as Exhibit 1 to
the Li Declaration lists the “Tenant(s)” as “Timothy Pojim.” (Li Decl., Ex. 1.)
Defendant’s name does not appear to be listed on the agreement. (Li Decl., Ex.
1.) It
does not appear that any explanation has been provided regarding this issue. 

Based on the foregoing, the Court denies the request for
default judgment without prejudice. The Court will discuss with Plaintiff a
schedule for resubmission of the default judgment package.
