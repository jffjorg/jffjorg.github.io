And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Defendant's renewed motion for nonsuit, dismissing the claims against him. The court finds that expert evidence is required to establish legal malpractice, and Plaintiff has not demonstrated that the alleged conduct required by Defendant is within the common knowledge of a layman. The court concludes that the issues in this case, including whether Defendant should have retained another expert after Dr. Zweig's report and whether Defendant should have retained an expert witness early on in the litigation, require expert testimony. The court also notes that unlike cases where the alleged malpractice is so obvious that no expert testimony is needed, this case does not involve wrongful legal advice or deficient legal research.
