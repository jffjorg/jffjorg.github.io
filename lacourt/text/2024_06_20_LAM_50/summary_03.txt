And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is a response to a motion filed by Neomie F. Hernandez, dba Exclusive Tax Service, to compel Diana Gonzalez Ruiz to attend her deposition and produce documents as previously ordered by the court. The court has determined that Diana Gonzalez Ruiz's opposition to the motion was untimely filed and served, and as such, Hernandez has not had sufficient time to file and serve a reply in support of the motion. The court has continued the hearing to a later date to allow Hernandez to file a new reply and has ordered Diana Gonzalez Ruiz to give notice of this order.
