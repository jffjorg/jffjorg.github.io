MOTION TO COMPEL
  DIANA GONZALEZ RUIZ TO ATTEND HER DEPOSITION AS PREVIOUSLY ORDERED AND
  PRODUCE DOCUMENTS; MONETARY SANCTIONS OF $2,135.00. PLUS THE REASONABLE COSTS
  INCURRED IN SEEKING A SECOND DEPOSITION




AND RELATED CROSS-ACTION


 



 
Background
Plaintiffs Claudia V. Gonzalez Ruiz, Carolina G. Ruiz (“Carolina
Ruiz”), and Diana Gonzalez Ruiz (“Diana Ruiz”) filed this action on February 3,
2021, against Defendant Neomie F. Hernandez, an individual, and dba Exclusive
Tax Service. The Complaint alleges fifteen causes of action.  
On March 26, 2021, Neomie
F. Hernandez dba Exclusive Tax Service filed a Cross-Complaint against Claudia
V. Gonzalez Ruiz, an individual and dba United Income Tax Services, Carolina
Ruiz, and Diana Ruiz. The Cross-Complaint alleges eight causes of action.   
Neomie F. Hernandez (“Hernandez”) notes that on December 21, 2023, the
Court issued an Order in this matter providing, inter alia, that that
“[t]he depositions of Diana Gonzalez Ruiz, Claudia V. Gonzalez Ruiz, and
Carolina G. Ruiz shall occur on January 17, 2024; February 8, 2024; and
February 9, 2024.” 
On December 28, 2023, Hernandez served a “Notice of Taking Deposition
of Diana Gonzalez Ruiz,” with the deposition noticed for January 17, 2024.
(Willoughby Decl., ¶¶ 6-9, Exs. C-D.) This Notice also included a “Request for
Production.” (Willoughby Decl., ¶ 8, Ex. C.) 
Hernandez’s counsel states that “Diana Gonzalez Ruiz did not object to
the deposition as noticed and did not object to the production of documents…On
January 17, 2024, Diana Gonzalez Ruiz appeared and testified. However, no
documents were produced.” (Willoughby Decl., ¶¶ 11-12.) Hernandez’s counsel
states that “[m]y office made multiple attempts to meet and confer on this
issue. A letter was sent to counsels for Diana Gonzalez Ruiz on February 19,
2024 via email… Thereafter the parties engaged series of back-and-forth email
exchanges.” (Willoughby Decl., ¶¶ 18-21, Exs. F-G.)
Hernandez’s counsel further states that “[a]s part of this email
exchange, counsels for Diana Gonzalez Ruiz, Claudia V. Gonzalez Ruiz, or
Carolina G. Ruiz emailed documents to my office March 1, 2024 long after the
depositions.” (Willoughby Decl., ¶ 22.) Hernandez’s counsel asserts that “[t]he
documents are unorganized. It is unclear what these documents are supposed to
be response [sic] to or if they are even responsive to any requests. There are
no verifications to authenticate these documents.” (Willoughby Decl., ¶ 24.) 
On May 30, 2024, an Informal Discovery Conference was held in this
matter. The Court’s May 30, 2024 minute order provides, inter alia, that
“[t]he matter is called for hearing. The parties have fulfilled their Informal
Discovery Conference requirements regarding the issues raised in their Informal
Discovery Conference statements dated 03/18/2024 and 05/23/2024. The parties
will meet and confer further regarding a possible further deposition to address
the documents produced after deposition.”
Hernandez now moves for an order compelling Diana Ruiz “to appear and
testify at her properly noticed deposition and to produce documents requested
therein as previously ordered by this Court.” Hernandez also seeks monetary
sanctions against Diana Ruiz “and/or her counsel.” The motion is opposed by Diana
Ruiz. 
Discussion 
As an initial matter, as noted by Hernandez, Diana
Ruiz’s opposition to the instant motion was untimely filed and served. Pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 1005, subdivision (b), “[a]ll papers opposing a motion so noticed
shall be filed with the court and a copy served on each party at least nine
court days, and all reply papers at least five court days before the hearing.”
In addition, “[a]ny period of notice, or any right or duty to do any act or
make any response within any period or on a date certain after the service of
the document, which time period or date is prescribed by statute or rule of
court, shall be extended after service by electronic means by two court days…” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1010.6,
subd. (a)(3)(B).)  
Here, Diana
Ruiz’s opposition
to the motion was filed on June 13, 2024. The proof of service filed with the
opposition indicates that the opposition was served on June 13, 2024 by
electronic service. However, the hearing on the instant motion was noticed for
June 20, 2024. Nine court days prior to June 20, 2024 is June 6, 2024. Two
court days prior to this date is June 4, 2024. As set forth above, Diana
Ruiz’s opposition
was filed and served by electronic service well after June 4, 2024, on June 13,
2024.[1] As noted by
Hernandez, “[t]his was not only past the deadline for the
opposition, but also past the deadline for a reply.” (Reply at p. 2:21-22.)[2]
Thus, Hernandez has not had the requisite statutory time to file
and serve a reply in support of the motion.  
In light of the
foregoing, the Court continues the hearing on Hernandez’s motion to
_______________, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. in Dept. 50.¿Hernandez may file a new reply
in support of the motion that will supersede the previously filed reply papers.
Any new reply must be filed and served per Code of
Civil Procedure section 1005, subdivision (b).¿ 
Hernandez is ordered to give notice of this order.
