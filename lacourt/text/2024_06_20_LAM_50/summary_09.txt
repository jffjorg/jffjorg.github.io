And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling on a motion for bifurcation filed by Tamoro. Larkin, the opposing party, argues that bifurcation is premature and that they need more time to complete discovery and file a motion for summary judgment/adjudication. However, the Court does not find this argument persuasive, as Larkin has not yet filed such a motion. The Judge notes that Larkin's opposition does not provide any evidence that they will file such a motion in the future. Therefore, the Court will proceed to consider Tamoro's motion for bifurcation.
