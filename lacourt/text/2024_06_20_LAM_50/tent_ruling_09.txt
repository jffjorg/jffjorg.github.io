[1]Larkin also asserts in its opposition that
“[b]ifurcation is premature. On June 4, 2024, Larkin
filed a Motion to Continue trial to April 2025. If the continuance is granted,
it will afford Larkin the requisite time to complete discovery and file its
motion for summary judgment/adjudication. Should Larkin prevail on its motion
for summary judgment/adjudication, either all of Quantum’s causes of action or
some causes of action will be discharged. At that time, the issue of
bifurcation will be ripe as the claims at issue will be determined.” (Opp’n at
p. 4:3-8.) However, the Court does not find that Larkin has shown that the
Court may not rule on Tamoro’s instant motion at this stage. Larkin does not
state that it has yet filed any motion for summary judgment/adjudication.
