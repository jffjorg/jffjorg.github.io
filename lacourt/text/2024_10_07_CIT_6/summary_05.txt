And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a lemon law case involving Ford Motor Company and plaintiffs Russell Gilliam and Lydia Gilliam. The case concerns Ford's motion to compel the depositions of the plaintiffs. The judge finds that Ford's efforts to meet and confer with the plaintiffs were insufficient, and therefore continues the hearings on the motion and orders the parties to meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by videoconference. If the parties are unable to resolve the issues underlying the motion, the judge directs them to request an informal discovery conference. The judge orders Ford to give notice of the ruling within five calendar days of the order.
