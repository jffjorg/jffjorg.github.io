And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the plaintiff's motion for issue, evidence, terminating, and monetary sanctions against the defendant, as well as the defendant's counter request for monetary sanctions. The plaintiff had sought sanctions against the defendant for failing to respond to discovery requests, but the court found that the defendant did not violate the court's order. The court also found that the plaintiff's motion did not contain a separate statement, which is required for a motion for issue and evidentiary sanctions. Additionally, the court denied the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions because they are not the prevailing party on this motion. The defendant is ordered to give notice of the court's ruling within five calendar days of this order.
