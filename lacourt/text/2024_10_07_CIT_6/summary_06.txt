And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint. The plaintiff seeks to add a claim for punitive damages and an allegation that the defendant, John Anthony Garduno Protic, fled the scene of the accident in violation of Vehicle Code section 20002, subdivision (a). The Court finds that the plaintiff has substantially complied with the requirements of Rule 3.1324 of the California Rules of Court and that the proposed amendment is necessary and proper. The Court also finds that the defendant's opposition arguments regarding clear and convincing evidence are unpersuasive, as this is only the pleading stage of the action. Therefore, the Court grants the motion and orders the plaintiff to file and serve the proposed First Amended Complaint within five days of the Court's order.
