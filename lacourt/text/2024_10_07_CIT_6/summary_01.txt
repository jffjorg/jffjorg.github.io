And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion brought by Defendant/Cross-Complainant Laurence Todd to dismiss with prejudice Plaintiff Nobia Joyce's causes of action for quiet title and partition. The judge found that the denial of Plaintiff's disability accommodation request was not a case-ending decision, but rather a request for accommodations during the administration of the trial. Therefore, Plaintiff was fully within her right to dismiss her causes of action for quiet title and partition against Todd without prejudice. The judge also admonished Plaintiff to comply with the requirements of the Code of Civil Procedure going forward.
