BACKGROUND 
This is a family business dispute. On November 15, 2023, plaintiffs
Jesse Hirezi (Jesse), an individual and as Trustee of the J & R Hirezi
Family Trust of April 20, 2015, Randa Hirezi (Randa), an individual and as
Trustee of the J & R Hirezi Family Trust of April 20, 2015 (collectively, Plaintiffs)
filed this action against defendants Hanna Bishara Hirezi a/k/a Hanna Hirezi
a/k/ John Hirezi (Hanna or John), Mona Qumsieh Hirezi a/k/a Mona Hirezi a/k/a
Mona J. Herzi, Bethlehem Star, Inc. (Bethlehem), Golden Springs, LLC (Golden
Springs), Arrow Beverage, Inc. (Arrow) (collectively, Defendants), and Does 1
through 20. On May 2, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the operative First Amended
Complaint, alleging causes of action for breach of partnership agreement,
breach of fiduciary duty, dissolution of partnership/corporation, accounting,
quasi contract and constructive trust, money had and received, declaratory
relief, and partition. 
On September 13, 2024, Defendants Jon, Golden Springs, and
Bethlehem filed a cross-complaint against Plaintiffs and Roes 1 through 10,
alleging causes of action for contribution, quantum meruit, and declaratory
relief. 
On August 27, 2024, Plaintiff Jesse moved to compel further
responses to Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, as to Defendant Hanna.
On September 23, 2024, Defendant Hanna opposed the motion. Jesse did not reply. 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
            Code of Civil Procedure section
2031.310(a) provides that on receipt of a response to a request for production
of documents, the demanding party may move for an order compelling further
responses if:
(1) A statement of compliance with the demand
is incomplete.
(2) A representation of inability to comply is
inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.
(3) An objection in the response is without
merit or too general. 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310(h)
further provides that “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter
7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response to a
demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (h).) 
DISCUSSION 
            Meet and
Confer 
            Per Code of Civil
Procedure section 2031.310, subdivision (b)(2), Plaintiff Jesse was required to
meet and confer with Defendant Hanna before bringing this motion. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).) The Court finds Plaintiff’s efforts to meet
and confer sufficient. (Spitz Decl., ¶¶ 4-8, 10-16.) 
Summary of
Arguments 
            Plaintiff Jesse seeks
for the Court to compel Defendant Hanna to provide further responses to
Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, contending that the requested
documents are necessary to prepare for trial. Jesse contends the requested
documents are central to the disputed issues in this case. Jesse then contends
Defendant Hanna has evaded discovery by providing no documents in response to
these discovery requests, that this failure was willful, and that there is no
substantial justification for Hanna’s failure to comply. 
            In opposition,
Defendant Hanna contends Jesse failed to demonstrate good cause in seeking ten
years of bank records, tax filings, and business records beyond the alleged
partnership. Hanna contends these requests implicate private information of the
Defendants and third party customers, as well as commercially sensitive
information concerning Defendants’ pricing and costs. Hanna contends Jesse has
not shown a compelling public interest in overcoming the privacy rights
implicated here. Hanna then contends that subject discovery requests are overly
broad and not reasonably calculated to lead to admissible evidence given that
the requests seek more than ten years’ worth of records, and that there is no
justification for this broad of a request. Hanna further contends Jesse is not
entitled to years of commercially sensitive business and financial records from
all Defendants, as this implicates trade secret information. Hanna also contends
Jesse has not obtained any order under Civil Code section 3295 for inquiring
into the financial condition of the Defendants. 
Analysis 
“The party asserting a privacy right must establish a
legally protected privacy interest, an objectively reasonable expectation of
privacy in the given circumstances, and a threatened intrusion that is
serious.” (Williams v. Superior Ct. (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 552 (Williams).
A party may assert the privacy rights of a third party “where the litigant's
interests align with those of the third party and the third party's rights are
likely to be diluted or adversely affected unless [the litigant] is permitted
to assert their rights on their behalf. [Citation.]” (Cnty. of Los Angeles v. Superior Ct. (2021) 65
Cal.App.5th 621, 635, internal quotation marks omitted.) The Court finds
Plaintiff Jesse is entitled to some, but not all, of the relief requested. 
Privacy – Request Numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 24, 25, 26, 27, and 42 
Request Numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10,
11, 12, 13, 24, 25, 26, 27, and 42 expressly request production of bank
records, tax returns, and financial documents, which are protected by privacy
rights. (Flora Crane Serv., Inc. v. Superior Ct. In & For City &
Cnty. of San Francisco (1965) 234 Cal.App.2d 767, 784 [“copies of
income tax returns are privileged from disclosure and therefore not subject to
production in discovery proceedings”]; Look v. Penovatz
(2019) 34 Cal.App.5th 61, 73 [individuals have a privacy right in their
personal financial information].) Moreover, although not addressed in the
parties’ respective briefs, the Court notes that many of these requests are
directed at the bank accounts of the corporate Defendants, i.e., Bethlehem,
Golden Springs, and Arrow, even though Hanna is the responding party. The Court
cannot compel Hanna to produce documents from bank accounts that do not belong
to Hanna. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.010.) 
Furthermore, while the requested documents appear relevant to this
action, the Court does not find Jesse has presented sufficient evidence showing
that the Court would be justified in disregarding these privileges. (SCC Acquisitions, Inc. v. Superior Ct. (2015) 243
Cal.App.4th 741, 754 (SCC Acquisitions) [constitutional right to privacy
is not absolute and the courts must balance the competing interests of the
right to discovery and the right to privacy].) Hanna also correctly contends
Jesse has not previously obtained a court order to inquire into Jesse’s financial
condition under Civil Code section 3295. (Civ. Code, § 3295.) 
Accordingly, the Court DENIES the motion as to Request Numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 24, 25, 26, and 27. 
Trade Secrets – Request Numbers 17, 18, 19, 20, 21,
22, 23, 28, 29, 30, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, and 41 
With respect to trade secrets, the Court finds
Plaintiff Jesse’s interest in seeking documents containing trade secret
protected information, such as pricing data, to outweigh Hanna’s concerns here.
“[A] party seeking discovery of trade secret information, ‘must make a prima
facie, particularized showing that the information sought is relevant and
necessary ... and that it is reasonable to conclude that the information sought
is essential to a fair resolution of the lawsuit. It is then up to the holder
of the privilege to demonstrate any claimed disadvantages of a protective
order. Either party may propose or oppose less intrusive alternatives to
disclosure of the trade secret, but the burden is on upon the trade secret
claimant to demonstrate that an alternative to disclosure will not be unduly
burdensome to the opposing side and that it will maintain the same fair balance
in the litigation that would have been achieved by disclosure.’ [Citation.]” (Multiversal Enterprises-Mammoth Properties, LLC v. Yelp Inc.
(2022) 74 Cal.App.5th 890, 900.) 
Plaintiffs’ lawsuit against Hanna and the other
Defendants is predicated upon alleged misappropriation of corporate profits and
withholding such profits from Plaintiffs, among other alleged wrongful actions.
(First Amended Complaint, ¶¶ 10-26.) While the Court agrees with Hanna that
many of Jesse’s requests seek trade secret information involving pricing data, they
are directly relevant to and necessary to resolve Jesse’s claims against
Defendants. (Whyte v. Schlage Lock Co. (2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 1443,
1456 [cost and pricing data not readily known in the industry is a trade
secret]; Multiversal Enterprises-Mammoth Properties, LLC v. Yelp Inc.,
supra, 74 Cal.App.5th at p. 900 [party seeking discovery of trade
secret information must demonstrate the information sought is relevant,
necessary, and essential to resolving the lawsuit].) Moreover, given Hanna’s
willingness to enter into a protective order, Hanna is not claiming any
disadvantages of a protective order. (Ibid.; Opp., 6:14-7:17.)
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS the motion as to Request Numbers 17, 18, 19, 20,
21, 22, 23, 28, 29, 30, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, and 41, subject to any protective
order the parties may enter into hereafter. Given the parties’ apparent
disagreements over the terms of the protective order, (Opp., 6:14-7:17), the
Court directs the parties to use the Los Angeles County Superior Court model
protective order. 
Request
Numbers 7, 14, 15, 16, 31, 32, 33, and 34 
The Court finds nothing objectionable about Request
Numbers 7, 14, 15, 16, 31, 32, 33, and 34. Request Number 7 merely asks Hanna
to produce the liquor license under which he is purportedly selling alcoholic
beverages. There is nothing on the faces of Request Numbers 14, 15, 16, 31, 32,
33, or 34 that obviously implicate the Defendants’ privacy rights. These
requests merely ask for documents evidencing payments made between Plaintiffs
and the corporate Defendants, which would presumably already be within the
possession of Plaintiffs to some extent. The Court finds nothing objectionable
about Request Number 31, as it merely asks Hanna to produce documents
evidencing money paid from Plaintiffs to Hanna, which also would presumably be
within the possession of Plaintiffs to some extent. To the extent these
requests implicate the privacy rights of Hanna or the corporate Defendants,
Hanna can provide appropriately redacted copies of documents or even a
privilege log if necessary. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.240, subd. (c)(1).)
Alternatively, if the parties enter into a protective order as discussed above
regarding trade secrets, the protective should resolve any concerns in that
regard. 
Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS the motion
as to Request Numbers 7, 14, 15, 16, 31, 32, 33, and 34. 
Corporate Minutes and Records – Request Numbers 43,
44, 45, 46, 47, and 48 
As for corporate minutes and documents submitted to
the California Secretary of State, Hanna cited no authority indicating those
items are protected by privacy rights, nor did the Court find any such
authority. Even if they were protected, the information sought appears to be
directly relevant to Jesse’s claims. (See SCC Acquisitions, supra, 243
Cal.App.4th at p. 754.) Therefore, the Court GRANTS the motion as to Request
Numbers 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, and 48. 
            Other
Arguments 
With respect to Hanna’s arguments of overbreadth and
not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, the
Court finds these arguments unavailing. Hanna did not indicate the amount of
work that would be required to respond. (W. Pico Furniture Co. of Los
Angeles v. Superior Ct. In & For Los Angeles Cnty. (1961) 56
Cal.2d 407, 417.) Also, the Court finds Plaintiff Jesse’s requests reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, as they relate to
his claims. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2017.010.) To the extent they seek information
inadmissible at trial, that is not a proper basis for objection. (Chapin v. Superior Ct. In & For Kern Cnty. (1966)
239 Cal.App.2d 851, 855.) 
            Sanctions 
Given the Court’s findings set forth above, the Court
finds the imposition of monetary sanctions would be unjust, and therefore DENIES
the parties’ respective requests for monetary sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (h).) 
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES Plaintiff Jesse Hirezi’s motion to compel further
responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, Request Numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 24, 25, 26, 27, and 42. 
The Court GRANTS the motion as to Request
Numbers 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 28, 29, 30, 35,
36, 37, 38, 39, 40, and 41, subject to any protective order the parties may
enter into hereafter. 
The Court further GRANTS the motion as to Request
Numbers 7, 14, 15, 16, 31, 32, 33, 34, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, and 48. 
The Court will discuss with the parties at the
hearing on this motion whether the parties intend to enter into a protective
order. The Court will also set the deadline for Defendant Hanna Hirezi’s
further responses and production of responsive documents at the hearing on this
motion. 
The Court DENIES the parties’ respective requests for
monetary sanctions. 
Plaintiff Jesse Hirezi is ordered to give notice of the Court’s
ruling within five calendar days of this order.
