And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the motion filed by attorney Matthew Barzman to be relieved as counsel for defendant Shyla Walker. The motion was filed on December 7, 2023, and was originally scheduled for hearing on January 24, 2024. However, the court advanced the hearing date to January 5, 2024, but continued the hearing to its originally noticed date of January 24, 2024 due to lack of notice to the client.

The judge finds that attorney Barzman has made a sufficient showing that withdrawing from representing Shyla Walker is warranted. However, the proposed Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel lodged on January 5, 2024, does not include the client's address and telephone number as required. If this information is provided at the hearing, the motion will be granted. If not, the motion will be denied without prejudice.
