And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in response to the demurrer filed by the defendant, California Automobile Insurance Company, to the Third Amended Complaint filed by the plaintiff, Clean Initiative LLC. The demurrer challenges the plaintiff's causes of action for breach of contract and tortious bad faith/breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the 2nd cause of action for tortious bad faith/breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing without leave to amend, finding that the terms of the Assignment of Insurance Benefits (AOB) limit the plaintiff's recovery to the amount owed for services rendered to the policy holder.

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the 1st cause of action for breach of contract with 20 days leave to amend, finding that the plaintiff failed to clearly allege that it has already rendered services to the policy holder.

The judge has also noted that the plaintiff's reply to the opposition included arguments that were not included in the demurrer and were therefore not considered in the ruling. Additionally, the judge warned the parties that failure to comply with court-ordered filing deadlines may result in late-filed papers not being considered.
