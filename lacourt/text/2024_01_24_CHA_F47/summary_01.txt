And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has placed the motion to relieve attorney Garabed Kamarian as counsel for plaintiff Madlen Hagopian off calendar. This is the fifth motion filed by Kamarian seeking to be relieved as counsel, and the previous three motions were taken off calendar due to service issues. The current motion was served by mail and personally, but did not provide the required notice and service. The judge notes that the proposed order lodged with the motion also fails to set forth the client's address and/or telephone number, as required. Since there is no response to the motion to cure the defects in notice, the judge has decided to place the motion off calendar.
