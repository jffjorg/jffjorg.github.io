Case #19CHCV00267
 
MOTION TO BE
RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
Motion filed on 1/16/24.
 
MOVING ATTORNEY: Garabed Kamarian
CLIENT: Plaintiff Madlen Hagopian
 
RULING: The motion is placed off calendar.     
 
This is the fifth motion filed by attorney Garabed
Kamarian seeking an order relieving him as counsel for Plaintiff Madlen
Hagopian (Plaintiff) in this action.  The
first three motions were taken off calendar by the Court due to issues with
service of the motion and the last hearing was continued to 1/24/24 also due to
service issues.  (See 12/6/22
Minute Order; 1/31/23 Minute Order; 3/15/23 Minute Order; 11/29/23 Minute Order).  
 
As noted above, on 11/29/23, the Court continued the
hearing on attorney Kamarian’s last motion to be relieved as counsel to 1/24/24
because there was no evidence that the motion had been properly served.  (See 11/29/23 Minute Order).  On 1/16/24, attorney Kamarian filed this
fifth motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff due to a breakdown in the
attorney/client relationship.  On
1/15/24, the motion was served by mail on counsel for the other parties.  (See 
Proof of Service filed 1/16/24). 
On 1/18/24, the motion was personally served on Plaintiff.  (See Proof of Service filed
1/19/24).  
 
The service of the motion did not provide the required 16
court days plus 5 calendar days required when a motion is served by mail or the
16 court days notice when a motion is personally served.  See CCP 1005(b).  There are no responses to the motion to cure
the defect in notice.  
 
Also, as noted in the Court’s 11/29/23 ruling, the
proposed Order lodged with the instant motion also does not set forth the
client’s address and/or telephone number as required in number 6.
