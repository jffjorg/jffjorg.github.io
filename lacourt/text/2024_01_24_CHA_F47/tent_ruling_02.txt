Case #21CHCV00099
 
MOTION TO BE
RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
Motion filed on 12/7/23.
 
MOVING ATTORNEY: Matthew Barzman
CLIENT: Defendant Shyla Walker
NOTICE: ok
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order relieving Matthew
Barzman as counsel for Defendant Shyla Walker in this action.
 
RULING: 
 
On  12/7/23,
attorney Matthew Barzman of Sanders Roberts LP filed and served the instant
motion to be relieved as counsel for Defendant Shyla Walker in this
action.  The motion was originally
scheduled for hearing on 1/24/24 but was advanced by the Court to 1/5/24 on
12/11/23.  (See 12/11/23 Minute
Order).  Because there was no evidence
that the client was provided notice of the advanced hearing date, on 1/5/24,
the hearing on the motion was continued to its originally noticed date of
1/24/24.
 
Attorney Barzman has made a sufficient showing that
withdrawing from representing Shyla Walker in this action is warranted.  
 
The proposed Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel on Judicial Council – Civil Form MC-053 lodged on 1/5/24 as
Exhibit A to the Notice of Lodging does not include the client’s address and
telephone number as required.  (See
proposed Order lodged 1/5/24, No.6).  If
this information is provided at the hearing, the motion will be granted.  If not, the motion will be denied without
prejudice.
