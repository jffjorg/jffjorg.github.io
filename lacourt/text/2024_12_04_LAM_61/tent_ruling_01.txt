  Case Number:  23STCV00238    Hearing Date:   December 4, 2024    Dept:  61 DEMETRIO LUNA-REYES, , et al. vs ARCHITECTURAL SURFACES, INC., et al.TENTATIVEPlaintiffs Demetrios Luna-Reyes and Guillemina Valdez’s Motion to Compel Deposition of Stone Etc.’s Person Most Qualified and Production for Documents is GRANTED. Sanctions are awarded against Defendant in the amount of $1,560.00, and payable within 30 days.Moving party to provide noticeDISCUSSIONA party may make a motion compelling a witness’s deposition “after service of a deposition notice” if that witness “fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.450, subd. (a).) The motion must include a meet-and-confer declaration and show good cause for the discovery sought. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.450, subd. (b)(1), (2).)Plaintiffs Demetrio Luna-Reyes and Guillemina Valdez (Plaintiffs) move to compel the deposition of third-party Stone Etc.’s person most qualified and the production of accompanying documents. Plaintiffs’ counsel declares that a notice of deposition subpoena was served on Stone, Plaintiff Luna-Reyes’ former employer, on July 12, 2024, to take place on August 22, 2024. (Nomani Decl. ¶¶ 7–8.) The subpoena sought documents as well, including Luna-Reyes’ employment records, records of whom he worked with, and records of the stone products and suppliers during the period of his employment from 2004 to 2005. (Nomani Decl. Exh. A.) Stone did not appear for deposition on the appointed date. (Nomani Decl. ¶ 11.) When Plaintiffs reached out to reschedule, the person they spoke to at Stone told them that they did not remember Plaintiff and did not wish to further engage in this litigation. (Nomani Decl. ¶ 14.)Plaintiffs have shown good cause for the order sought. The subpoena seeks relevant documents related to the subject matter of this action, and Stone has not complied with the subpoena. Although the period in question is 20 years past, Stone may be required to present a person most qualified to testify to the presence or absence of responsive records and information.The motion is therefore GRANTED.II. SANCTIONSIf a motion under subdivision (a) is granted, the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)Plaintiffs seek $1,560.00 against Stone in connection with this motion, representing three hours of attorney work at $350 per hour, plus $450 for Stone’s non-appearance at deposition, and a $60 filing fee. (Nomani Decl. ¶ 17.) The Court finds that these amounts are reasonable.Sanctions are awarded against Stone in the amount of $1,560.00.
