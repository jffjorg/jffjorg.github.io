And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on a motion for attorney fees and costs filed by Security Building Loft Partners LP (Defendant) following the sustaining of its demurrer without leave to amend. The Defendant seeks $27,064.50 in attorney fees and $1,084.32 in costs, based on a fees provision in the lease executed by the Defendant and Audra Karim (Plaintiff) in 2018. The judge has denied the motion for attorney fees, finding that the indemnification clause in the lease is not a provision for attorney fees, but rather a standard third-party indemnification provision. The judge has granted the motion for costs, awarding $765.57 in costs, but has denied the costs sought in connection with filing fees associated with motions to compel and deem admitted, which were never heard.
