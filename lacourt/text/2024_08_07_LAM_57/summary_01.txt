And here is the summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case 23STCV19401. The Defendants' demurrer to the Plaintiffs' fraud claim is overruled because the statute of limitations for fraud claims is delayed until the plaintiff discovers or has reason to discover the cause of action, which in this case is alleged to have occurred in 2021. The Plaintiffs' filing of the lawsuit in 2023 is therefore within the three-year statute of limitations.

The Judge has also denied the Defendants' motion to strike the entire complaint, as the minute order setting forth the Court's ruling on the demurrer did not specify a due date for the Second Amended Complaint (SAC). The Court is exercising its discretion to allow the SAC to proceed because it was filed just a few days after the deadline.

Additionally, the Judge has denied the Defendants' motion to strike the allegations regarding punitive damages against Defendant SGI Management, as the SAC alleges intentional conduct by SGI Management that would support an award of punitive damages.
