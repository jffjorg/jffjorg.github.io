ANALYSIS:
 
On January 19, 2024, Defendant Cappo
Management XLI LLC dba Ocean Honda of Whittier (“Defendant Ocean Honda”) served
Form Interrogatories, Set One and Special Interrogatories, Set One, on
Plaintiff Martha Delia Anda (“Plaintiff”). (Motions,
Chang Decl., Exh. A.) Despite a meet and confer effort extending the
deadline to serve verified responses without objections, Plaintiff has not
served responses to the discovery. (Id. at ¶¶4-10 and Exh. B.) Defendant
Ocean Honda filed the instant (1) Motion to Compel Responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions; and (2) Motion to Compel
Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions, on April
26, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date. 

 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to compel initial responses can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290.) Further, the motion can be brought at any time after the responding
party fails to provide the responses. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290.) Based on Plaintiff’s failure to timely
respond to the propounded discovery, Defendant Ocean Honda is entitled to an
order compelling them to serve verified responses to the discovery requests
without objections. 
 
Plaintiff’s failure to timely respond constitutes a misuse
of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) Sanctions
are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030
and have been properly noticed. However, the amount sought is excessive for
simple and unopposed motions. Pursuant to a lodestar calculation, sanctions are
awarded against Plaintiff in the amount of $546.00 based on two hours of
attorney time billed at $213.00 per hour and filing fees of $60.00 per motion.
(Motions, Chang Decl.,
¶11.)

DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER. PLAINTIFF MARTHA DELIA ANDA AND COUNSEL OF RECORD
