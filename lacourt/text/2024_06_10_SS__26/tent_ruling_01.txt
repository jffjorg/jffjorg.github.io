TENTATIVE RULING: 
 
Defendant New Management, LLC’s Motion for Leave to File
Cross-Complaint is DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
On July 21,
2022, Plaintiff Totum Corporation (“Plaintiff”) filed this action for breach of
contract and common counts against Defendant New Management, LLC (“Defendant”). Following entry of default against
Defendant, the parties stipulated to vacate the default and allow Defendant to
file an answer. (Stip and Order, filed 01/25/23.) Defendant filed an answer on
February 28, 2023. 
 
The case was called for trial on January 18, 2024 at
which time the Court ordered the parties to make corrections to their
witness list and refile. (Minute Order, 01/18/24.) The trial was briefly
continued to February 6, 2024. (Ibid.) On January 31, 2024, the Court
granted Defendant’s ex parte application to continue the trial date and set the
new trial date for June 6, 2024. (Minute Order, 01/31/24.) 
 
Defendant filed the
instant Motion for Leave to File Cross-Complaint on March 28, 2024. Plaintiff
filed an opposition on May 29, 2024. 
 
Defendant filed a
Motion to Continue Trial Date on May 30, 2024, which is set for hearing on June
24, 2024. On June 3, 2024, the Court denied Defendant’s ex parte application to
shorten time on the Motion to Continue Trial Date. (Minute Order, 06/03/24.)
The Court also sua sponte continued the June 6, 2024 trial date to June 12,
2024. (Ibid.) 
 
Discussion
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 428.50 provides:
 
“(a) A party
shall file a cross-complaint against any of the parties who filed the complaint
or cross-complaint against him or her before or at the same time as the answer
to the complaint or cross-complaint.
 
(b) Any other cross-complaint
may be filed at any time before the court has set a date for trial.
 
(c) A party shall obtain leave
of court to file any cross-complaint except one filed within the time specified in subdivision (a) or (b).  Leave
may be granted in the interest of justice at any time during the course of the action.”
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 428.50.)
Furthermore, “[a] party who fails to plead a cause of action subject to the
requirements of this article, whether through oversight, inadvertence, mistake, neglect, or other cause, may
apply to the court for leave to amend his pleading, or to file a
cross-complaint, to assert such cause at any time during the course of the
action. The court, after notice to the adverse party, shall grant, upon such terms as may be just to the parties, leave
to amend the pleading, or to file the cross-complaint, to assert such cause if
the party who failed to plead the cause acted in good faith.  This subdivision
shall be liberally construed to avoid
forfeiture of causes of action.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 426.50, emphasis added.)
 
Defendant’s Motion is
brought on the grounds that after new defense counsel was hired, issues with
construction management for which Plaintiff was responsible were discovered.
(Motion, pp. 2:26-3:3.) These issues purportedly give rise to causes of action
against Plaintiff that relate to the Complaint. (Ibid.) The Motion,
however, does not explain when exactly these issues were discovered following
defense counsel’s substitution in November 2020. Nor is the Motion supported by
a declaration attesting to these facts regarding the discovery of facts that
give rise to claims against Plaintiff. In opposition, Plaintiff further points
out that Defendant’s answer to the Complaint, filed last February, already alleged
Plaintiff’s non-performance under the contract. (Opp., Liberatore Decl., Exh.
A, pp. 4:23-5:3.) Facts in support of this alleged defense were also provided
when Defendant responded to Plaintiff’s discovery requests in July 2023. (Id.
at Exh. B, pp. 4:1-9, 6:16-22.) These circumstances together demonstrate that Defendant
did not recently discover facts giving rise to cross-claims and should have
either filed the cross-complaint concurrently with the answer or sought leave
to file the cross-complaint shortly thereafter. It appears, therefore, that Defendant’s
motive in seeking leave to file a cross-complaint on the eve of the trial date
is in bad faith. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the above, Defendant New Management, LLC’s Motion for Leave
to File Cross-Complaint is DENIED.
 
 
Plaintiff to give notice.
