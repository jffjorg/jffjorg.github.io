ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Jonathan
Valadez (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action against Defendant Martin Becerra
(“Defendant”) on March 14, 2024. Defendant filed the instant Demurrer to the
Complaint on May 2, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date.
 
The Demurrer and supporting document are not accompanied by a proof of
service demonstrating they were served on Plaintiff. Nor is there any
indication that Plaintiff was given notice of the hearing. Failure to
give notice of a motion is not only a violation of the statutory requirements
but of due process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005; Jones v. Otero (1984) 156
Cal.App.3d 754, 757.) Accordingly, the
hearing on the Demurrer is continued to allow for Defendant to provide proper
notice of the papers and new hearing date. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Martin
Becerra’s Demurrer to the Complaint is CONTINUED TO AUGUST 19, 2024 AT 10:00 AM
IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE. BY JULY 29, 2024, DEFENDANT
IS TO FILE A PROOF OF SERVICE DEMONSTRATING SERVICE OF THE DEMURRER, SUPPORTING
PAPERS, AND NOTICE OF THE NEW HEARING DATE ON PLAINTIFF JONATHAN VALADEZ.
FAILURE TO DO SO MAY RESULT IN THE DEMURRER BEING OVERRULED.
