And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant's demurrer to the complaint is continued to August 19, 2024, at 10:00 AM in Department 26 of the Spring Street Courthouse. By July 29, 2024, the defendant must file a proof of service demonstrating service of the demurrer, supporting papers, and notice of the new hearing date on the plaintiff. Failure to do so may result in the demurrer being overruled. This decision is made because the demurrer was filed without providing proof of service and without giving notice to the plaintiff.
