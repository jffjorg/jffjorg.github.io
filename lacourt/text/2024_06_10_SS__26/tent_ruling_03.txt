ANALYSIS:
 
On February 27, 2024, Plaintiff Leticia Martinez
(“Plaintiff”) served Special Interrogatories, Set One, on Defendant Bollywood
Bites, Inc. (“Defendant”). (Motion, Mehrban Decl.,
Exh. A.) Despite a meet-and-confer effort extending the deadline to serve
verified responses without objections, Defendant has not served responses. (Id.
at ¶¶4-5 and Exh. B.) Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Compel Responses to
Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions, on April 17, 2024.
No opposition has been filed to date.
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to compel initial responses can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290.) Further, the motion can be brought any time after the responding
party fails to provide the responses. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290.) Based on Defendant Bollywood Bites, Inc.’s
failure to timely respond to the propounded discovery, Plaintiff is entitled to
an order compelling it to serve verified responses to the discovery requests
without objections. 
 
Defendant Bollywood Bites, Inc.’s failure to timely respond
constitutes a misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010,
subd. (d).) Sanctions are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections
2023.010 and 2023.030 and have been properly noticed. Sanctions are awarded
against Defendant Bollywood Bites, Inc. and counsel of record in the amount of
$500.00 based on one hour of attorney time billed at $500.00 per hour. (Motion,
Mehrban Decl.,
¶6.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Leticia Martinez’ Motion to Compel Responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions, is GRANTED. DEFENDANT BOLLYWOOD BITES, INC. IS TO SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES TO SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE, WITHOUT
OBJECTIONS, WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER. DEFENDANT BOLLYWOOD
BITES, INC. AND COUNSEL OF RECORD ARE
JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY ORDERED TO PAY
SANCTIONS OF $500.00 TO PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS
ORDER.
