 Case Number:  23BBCV01882    Hearing Date:   September 12, 2024    Dept:  X Plaintiff’s
Motion for Attorney Fees
 
            On August 15, 2023, Plaintiff
filed a complaint against Defendants Sunrise Ford North Hollywood and Ford
Motor Company, which included a claim for Violation of Song-Beverly Consumer
Warranty Act-Civil Code §1790 et seq.  On
or about May 22, 2024, Plaintiff accepted Defendants’ CCP § 998 Offer to
Compromise.
 
Plaintiff moves for an order that
determines the reasonable attorney fees payable to Plaintiff by Defendant Ford
Motor Company.  Plaintiff seeks fees in
the amount of $81,997.50 and reasonable costs in the amount of $1,044.45.
 
The Court GRANTS the motion and
determines $21,915.00 to be a reasonable award of attorney fees.  Costs are also awarded in the amount of
$1,044.45, bringing the total award to $22,959.45.
 
Generally, each party is responsible for their attorney fees unless a
statute or contract provides otherwise for the prevailing party.  (Eden Township Healthcare Dist. v. Eden
Medical Center (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 418, 425.)  In determining which party is the prevailing
party, trial courts may consider all factors reasonably indicating success in
the litigation but may not abuse their discretion and deny fees arbitrarily.  (Sears v.¿Baccaglio¿(1998) 60
Cal.App.4th 1136, 1149, 1155, 1158.)¿  A
court abuses its discretion by denying fees where the party obtained a
“‘simple, unqualified win,’” and the results were not mixed.  (Pacific Custom Pools, Inc. v. Turner
Construction Co.¿(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1254, 1268-1271.)
 
“[T]he starting point of every fee award…must be a calculation of the
attorney’s services in terms of the time he has expended on the case.  Anchoring the analysis to this concept is the
only way of approaching the problem that can claim objectivity, a claim which
is obviously vital to the prestige of the bar and the courts.”  (In re Vitamin Cases¿(2003) 110 Cal.App.4th
1041, 1058.)  ¿“[T]he primary method for
establishing the amount of ‘reasonable’ attorney fees is the lodestar method.  The lodestar (or touchstone) is produced by
multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended by counsel by a reasonable
hourly rate.”  (Thayer v. Wells Fargo
Bank, N.A.¿(2001) 92¿Cal.App.4th 819, 833.)  Under this approach, a base amount is
calculated from a compilation of time¿reasonably spent¿and¿reasonable hourly
compensation¿of each attorney.¿ (Serrano v. Unruh¿(1982) 32
Cal.3d 621, 639.)  While “a fee request
ordinarily should be documented in great detail,” the absence of time records
and billing statements did not deprive the court of “substantial evidence” to
support an award when the attorney provided a declaration under the penalty of
perjury which described the work and permitted the trial court to make its own
evaluation of the reasonableness of the work done in light of the nature of the
case and on the credibility of counsel’s declaration.  (Weber v.¿Langholz¿(1995) 39
Cal.App.4th 1578, 1587.)
 
Here, it is undisputed that Plaintiff is the prevailing party.  Further, Section 1794, subdivision (a)
authorizes the recovery of damages and other legal and equitable relief when
the action involves a buyer of consumer goods that is damaged by an implied or
express warranty of a contract.  Section 1794,
subdivision (d) further authorizes the recovery of attorney’s fees “based on
actual time expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred
by the buyer in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such
action.”  (Civ. Code, § 1794(d).)
 
Turning
to the hourly rate, Plaintiff’s counsel, Sean M. Novak, declares his to be
$975.00.  (Novak Decl., ¶ 6.)  The opposition complains that the hourly rate
of $975.00 is unreasonable for even the most experienced attorney in a simple
garden variety lemon law case.  (Proudfoot
Decl. ¶ 4.)  The opposition states Novak
has not presented any evidence of prior lemon law experience to justify his
rate and his declaration only evidences his experience in purely contingent
cases such as personal injury matters.  (See Novak Decl., ¶ 6.)
 
A
reasonable hourly rate is determined by the prevailing rate charged to
attorneys of similar skill and experience in the relevant community.  (See PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000)
22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.)  However, the
court may also consider the attorney’s skill and expertise, the nature of the
work performed, the relevant area of expertise and the attorney’s customary
billing rates.  (Flannery v.
California Highway Patrol (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 629, 632.)  The court is the best judge of the value of
professional services provided and may use its discretion to apply rates in
line with the market rates for the services provided.  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1132.)  Based on the court’s
knowledge and experience, it determines that $450.00 represents a reasonable
hourly rate.
 
As to
the number of hours expended in prosecuting this action, Plaintiff submitted
the Declaration of Sean Novak, which includes an attorney billing statement
attached as Exhibit C.  Plaintiff’s
counsel’s seven months of litigation work included participation in discovery
and responding to Defendants’ raised issues.
 
A
court “must carefully review attorney documentation of hours expended” to
determine whether the time reported was reasonable.  (See Ketchum, supra, 24 Cal.4th at
p. 1132 (quoting Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 48).)  Thus, evidence provided by the fee applicant
“should allow the court to consider whether the case was overstaffed, how much
time the attorneys spent on particular claims, and whether the hours were
reasonably expended.” (Christian Research Inst. v. Alnor (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th
1315, 1320.  The court must exclude
“duplicative or excessive” time from its fee award.  (Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc.
(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 161; see also Ketchum, supra, at p. 1132 [stating
“inefficient or duplicative efforts [are] not subject to compensation.”].)
 
The
billing records submitted by Plaintiff’s counsel indicate that Mr. Novak
expended 74.1 hours and anticipates an additional 10 hours of time through the
hearing on this motion. (Novak Decl. ¶ 5.)  The opposition claims the reported hours were
not reasonably incurred and points to several litigation facts, some of which
are addressed by Plaintiff in his Reply.  The Court determines that 48.7 hours are
reasonable, which includes the time associated with the bringing and hearing of
this motion.  At an hourly rate of $450.00,
attorney fees are awarded in the amount of $21,915.00.
 
Finally,
on the issue of costs, Civil Code section 1794, subdivision (d) states, “If the
buyer prevails in an action under this section, the buyer shall be allowed by
the court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate
amount of costs and expenses,…, determined by the court to have been reasonably
incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and prosecution of
such action.  The Court awards $1,044.45 in
recoverable costs. 
 
Conclusion 
 
The Court GRANTS the motion in the
reduced amount of $21,915.00
and costs in the amount of $1,044.45.  In total, Plaintiff is awarded $22,959.45 in
attorney fees and costs.
