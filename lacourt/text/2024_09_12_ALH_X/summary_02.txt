And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiffs' motion to tax costs from the defendant's memorandum of costs. The defendant's memorandum of costs sought $39,555.98, but the judge has reduced this amount by $10,516.63. The judge has granted the motion to tax costs for certain items, including the filing and motion fees for the answer, jury fees, deposition costs for certain witnesses, and witness fees for experts who did not testify. However, the judge has denied the motion to tax costs for certain other items, including the cost of serving process and the cost of models, enlargements, and photocopies of exhibits. The judge's ruling is based on the applicable law, including Code of Civil Procedure section 998, which governs offers to compromise, and Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, which governs recoverable costs.
