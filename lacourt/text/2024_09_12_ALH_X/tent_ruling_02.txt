 Case Number:  20STCV33913    Hearing Date:   September 12, 2024    Dept:  X Plaintiffs’
Motion to Tax Defendant’s Memorandum of Costs
 
            Plaintiffs
move to tax or strike costs from Defendant’s memorandum of costs.  Plaintiffs
alleged a personal injury claim stemming from a dog bite by Defendant Filippo
Marchino’s dog. Plaintiffs filed their complaint on September 4, 2020.  On May 6, 2024, a jury returned a special
verdict in favor of Defendant and against Plaintiffs.  On June 24, 2024, Defendant filed a
memorandum of costs seeking a total of $39,555.98.
 
Plaintiff’s motion to tax costs
on Defendant’s memorandum of costs is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.  Defendant’s memorandum of cost is reduced by $10,516.63,
with total costs awarded in the amount of $29,039.35.
            
On
December 13, 2021, Defendant served a Code of Civil Procedure section 998 Offer
to Compromise.  This offer was not
accepted by Plaintiffs and the jury found in favor of Defendant at trial.  Because Plaintiffs did not accept Defendant’s 998
Offer, and they failed to obtain a more favorable judgment, Plaintiff cannot
recover his costs incurred after December 13, 2021 and must pay Defendant’s post-December
13, 2021 costs.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
998(c)(1).)  The Court has discretion as
to whether and in what amount Plaintiffs may be required to pay actual and
reasonable costs of the services of expert witnesses who are not regular
employees of any party in preparation for or during trial.  (Ibid.)
 
Item 1: Filing and motion fees $2,178.14
GRANT motion to tax
in the amount of $435.00 for the Answer, which was filed on July 16, 2021,
before the 998 Offer.  Defendant is not
entitled to recover the cost of the Answer pursuant to Section 998 (c)(1).
 
Item 2: Jury fees $525.11
GRANT motion to tax
in the amount of $150.00 for 12/08/21 jury fees.  This cost was incurred before the 998 Offer.
 
Item 4: Deposition costs $7,653.47
DENY motion to tax
Julie Choi’s certificate of non-appearance.
GRANT motion to tax
in the amount of $445.15 for witness Allison Klein, who did not testify at
trial, and in the combined sum of $1,716.82 for Meghedi Badall and Omar
Perciado, who did not testify at trial.  The
Court finds their costs are not reasonable or necessary.  The total amount taxed for deposition costs is
$2,161.97.
 
Item 5: Service of process $2,816.16
DENY motion to tax
Julie Choi’s registered process fee. 
GRANT motion to tax
in the amount of $353.48 for service of process fees on medical personnel who
did not testify: Wilson H. Park, Nees Chiropractic, Pasadena Primary Care, Dr.
Jon Greenfield, and Adventist Health.  

Item 8: Witness fees $12,659.00
GRANT motion to tax
expert fees as to experts that did not testify: Beau LeBlanc ($3,477.50), Ryan
Wiley ($450.00), Kathrina Boyles ($387.00), Blake Newton ($560.00), Ryan Porter
($874.00), Le Sun ($1,417.50), and Drew Sauvola ($18.00).  The total amount taxed for witness fees is $7,184.00.
 
Item 12: Models, enlargements, and photocopies of exhibits
$4,323.20
DENY motion regarding
Models, Enlargements, and Photocopies of Exhibits.  Expenses that are “reasonably helpful to aid
the trier of fact” are recoverable costs.  (Code Civ. Proc., §1033.5(a)(13).)  Defendant, by way of his opposition, has
satisfied his burden of substantiating the claims with counsel’s declaration
and a copy of invoices/supporting documentation. 
 
Item 16: Other $232.18
GRANT motion regarding
Defendant’s “Other” costs.
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s
motion to tax costs on Defendant’s memorandum of costs is granted in part and
denied in part.  Defendant’s memorandum
of cost is reduced by $10,516.63.
