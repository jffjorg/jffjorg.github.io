Demurrer to Complaint and Motion to Strike 
 
The court has
considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply.
The demurrer is
sustained without leave to amend and the motion to strike is denied as moot. 
Background
            This
is an action arising from the alleged wrongful possession of a mobilehome. On
October 11, 2023, Plaintiff Judith Collie (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint for
Claim and Delivery against Defendant Aracelly Santoyo. 
            On
December 14, 2023, a Notice of Related Case was filed indicating that the
instant action was related to Aracely Santoyo v. Judith Collie, et al.,
LASC Case No. 21STCV07423 (the “Underlying Action”), which was filed on
February 25, 2021 and is pending in Department 45 of this Court. 
            On
January 17, 2024, Defendant Aracely Santoyo (“Defendant”), who indicates that
she was erroneously sued and served as “Aracelly Santoyo,” filed and served the
instant demurrer to the Complaint, as well as a motion to strike. 
            On
February 1, 2024, the Court issued an order deeming the instant action and the
Underlying Action as related cases with the Underlying Action being the lead
case. (02/01/24 Minute Order.) 
On April 15,
2024, Plaintiff filed a combined opposition to the demurrer and motion to
strike, to which Defendant replied on April 25, 2024. 
On May 2, 2024,
after hearing, the Court continued the hearing on the demurrer and motion to
strike to Tuesday, June 4, 2024 so that the parties could engage in meet and
confer discussions. (05/02/24 Minute Order.) 
On May 14, 2024,
Defendant’s counsel, Yasmaine Tabatabai (“Tabatabai”), filed a supplemental
declaration in support of the demurrer and motion to strike which attests to
meeting and conferring telephonically with Plaintiff on May 9, 2024 as to the
subject of the demurrer and motion to strike. (Tabatabi Supp. Decl., ¶¶ 14-16;
Exh. 7.) 
On May 24, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a supplemental declaration in opposition to the demurrer and
motion to strike, which in fact is not a supplemental declaration but rather
appears to be a supplemental opposition brief. The Court did not grant
Plaintiff leave to file a supplemental opposition brief. Moreover, Plaintiff’s
May 24, 2024 purported supplemental declaration was not filed with a proof of
service. The Court therefore strikes Plaintiff’s May 24, 2024 supplemental
declaration pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. § 436(b). The Court acknowledges that
Plaintiff is representing herself in pro per; however, a pro per
litigant is “held to the same standards as attorneys.” (Kobayashi v.
Superior Court (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 536, 543.) 
 
 
Legal
Standard
 “A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a
complaint as a matter of law.” (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183
Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.) “[T]he court gives the complaint a reasonable
interpretation, and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded.” (Ibid.)  In
testing the sufficiency of the complaint, the court must assume the truth of
(1) the properly pleaded factual allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably
inferred from those expressly pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone
and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. (SKF Farms v. Superior
Court (1984) 153 Cal. App. 3d 902, 905.) In assessing a demurrer, a court
can consider facts in exhibits attached to the complaint. (Picton v.
Anderson Union High School Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 726, 733.)
Accordingly, “[w]hether the plaintiff will be able to prove the pleaded facts
is irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer.” (Stevens v. Superior Court
(1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 605, 609-10.) A general demurrer may be taken to a
complaint where “[t]he pleading does not state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.10(e).) Although courts construe
pleadings liberally, sufficient facts must be alleged to support the
allegations plead to survive a demurrer. (Rakestraw v. California
Physicians' Serv. (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.) 
            Where
a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be allowed where there is a
reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman
v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) The burden is on the party who
filed the pleading subject to demurrer to show the court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Ibid.)
Judicial Notice
            The
Court GRANTS Defendant’s request for judicial notice pursuant to Evidence Code
§§ 452 and 453. While the Court does take judicial notice of court records, the
Court reminds Defendant that it “cannot take judicial notice of hearsay
allegations in a court record, . . . [and] can [only] take judicial notice of
the truth of facts asserted in documents such as orders, findings of fact and
conclusions of law, and judgments.” (Starr v. Ashbrook (2023) 87
Cal.App.5th 999, 1014.) 
Meet and Confer
            Before
filing a demurrer or motion to strike, the moving party must meet and
confer in person, by telephone, or by
video conference with the party who filed the pleading to attempt to reach an
agreement that would resolve the objections to the pleading. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 430.41, 435.5.) “Any determination by the court that the meet and confer
process was insufficient shall not be grounds to overrule or sustain a
demurrer” or to grant or deny a motion to strike. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41,
subd. (a)(4), 435.5.)
            Defendant
presents evidence that the parties met and conferred telephonically with on May
9, 2024 as to the subject of the demurrer and motion to strike. (Tabatabi Supp.
Decl., ¶¶ 14-16; Exh. 7.)
            The Court finds that the meet and
confer requirement has been met. 
Discussion
            Allegations of the
Complaint
            The Complaint is set forth on pleading paper and states that “Plaintiff .
. . brings . . . her cause of action for claim and delivery against Defendant.”
(Complaint at p. 1:24-26.) Plaintiff alleges that she was and still is entitled
to the return of her property which Plaintiff describes as “24425 Woolsey
Canyon Road Space 46, West Hills, CA 91304 Decal No LAH7856, LA JOLLA Serial
Numbers GDSMCA40801492A/B/C, HUD Label A437052/3/424425 Woolsey Canyo [sic]
Road Space 46, West Hills, CA 91304 Decal No LAH7856, LA JOLLA Serial Numbers
GDSMCA40801492A/B/C, HUD Label A437052/3/4” (the “Property”). (Complaint at p.
2:1-4.)  Plaintiff alleges that on or
about August 27, 2015, she gave custody of the Property to Defendant pursuant
to a written agreement between the parties for use of the Property until
September 2, 2018. (Complaint, ¶ 7(b).) 
            Sufficiency of Plaintiff’s Cause of Action
for Claim and Delivery
            Defendant
argues that claim and delivery is not a specific cause of action but is,
rather, a remedy. Plaintiff’s opposition brief does not address such argument
and the Court finds that Plaintiff has conceded to such argument as
“[c]ontentions are waived when a party fails to support them with reasoned
argument and citations to authority.” (Moulton Niguel Water Dist. v. Colombo
(2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1210, 1215.) 
            “Claim
and delivery is a remedy by which a party with a superior right to a specific
item of personal property (created, most commonly, by a contractual lien) may
recover possession of that specific property before judgment.” (Ananda
Church of Self-Realization v. Massachusetts Bay Ins. Co. (2002) 95
Cal.App.4th 1273, 1281-82.) “[C]laim and delivery denominates a remedy rather
than a tort.” (Id. at p. 1281.) 
            Here,
Plaintiff clearly indicated in the Complaint that her cause of action against
Defendant is one for claim and delivery. Under Ananda Church, supra,
95 Cal.App.4th 1273, 1281-82, claim and delivery is not an independent tort but
rather a remedy. 
            The Statute of Limitations
            Additionally,
Plaintiff does not rebut Defendant’s argument that the Complaint is barred by
the statute of limitations. “In an action for claim and delivery of personal
property . . . the statute of limitations runs from the time of the wrongful
taking of possession or the illegal exercise of dominion over the property.” (Reed
v. Molony (1940) 38 Cal.App.2d 405, 411.) “An action for taking, detaining,
or injuring goods or chattels, including an action for the specific recovery of
personal property” is subject to a three-year statute of limitations. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 338, subd. (c)(1).) “An important exception to the general rule
of accrual is the discovery rule, which postpones accrual of a cause of action
until the plaintiff discovers, or has reason to discover, the cause of action.”
(Id. at p. 807.) “A plaintiff has reason to discover a cause of action
when he or she has reason at least to suspect a factual basis for its
elements.” (Ibid.) “In order to rely on the discovery rule for delayed
accrual of a cause of action, [a] plaintiff whose complaint shows on its face
that his claim would be barred without the benefit of the discovery rule must
specifically plead facts to show (1) the time and manner of discovery and (2)
the inability to have made earlier discovery despite reasonable diligence.” (Id.
at p. 808.) “In assessing the sufficiency of the allegations of delayed
discovery, the court places the burden on the plaintiff to show diligence;
conclusory allegations will not [suffice].” (Ibid.) 
            Here,
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant wrongfully exercised dominion over the
Property on or about September 2, 2018. (Complaint, ¶ 7(b).) Plaintiff,
however, did not file the instant action until October 11, 2023, which is
beyond the three-year statute of limitations. Here, Plaintiff does not plead
any facts showing diligence. 
            Based
on the Court’s discussion above as to claim and delivery not being an
independent cause of action as well as Plaintiff’s failure to invoke the
delayed discovery rule, the Court finds that the Complaint fails to state a
cause of action and is barred by the statute of limitations. The Court need not
address the argument as to the Complaint being barred by the doctrine of issue
preclusion. Plaintiff has failed to meet her burden in showing that there is a
reasonable possibility of successful amendment. 
            The
Court therefore SUSTAINS Defendant’s demurrer to the Complaint WITHOUT LEAVE TO
AMEND. 
            Motion to Strike
            Defendant
moves to strike the Complaint in its entirety or, alternatively, Plaintiff’s
punitive damages allegations. Given that the Court has sustained the demurrer
without leave to amend, the Motion to Strike is MOOT and therefore DENIED. 
             
It is so
ordered.
