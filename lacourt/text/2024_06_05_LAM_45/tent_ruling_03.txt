Background
This is a
habitability case. Plaintiffs Beatriz Laynez, an individual; Emili Gabriela
Chavez Laynez, a minor by and through her guardian ad litem; Beatriz Laynez;
Jayleen Arlette Chavez Laynez, a minor by and through her guardian ad litem,
Beatriz Laynez; and Jeremy Elijah Chavez-Laynez, a minor by and through her
guardian ad litem, Beatriz Laynez filed this action against Defendants Alvarado
Equities LLC, Robert Staback, as Trustee of The Rudolph and Grace Staback
Revocable Inter Vivos Trust, and JNM Realty Inc. alleging causes of action for (1) Breach of
Warranty of Habitability; (2) Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment; (3)
Negligence; and (5) Breach of Contract.
Claimants Emili Gabriela Chavez Laynez and Jayleen
Arlette Chavez Laynez, minors by and
through their guardian ad litem Beatriz Laynez filed their petitions on May
6, 2024.
 
Discussion
            Claimants Emili Gabriela Chavez Laynez and Jayleen
Arlette Chavez Laynez, minors by and
through their guardian ad litem Beatriz Laynez, each petition for
approval of compromise of pending action.
Court approval
is required to establish an enforceable settlement of a minor’s claim. (Prob.
Code, §§ 2504, 3500, 3600, et seq.;
CCP, § 372.) Indeed, until a petition for such approval is granted by the
court, there is no final settlement, and any settlement agreement therefore is
voidable. (Scruton v. Korean Air Lines Co.
(1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1596, 1603-05.) Petitions for approval of the compromise
of a pending action are governed by Cal. Rules of Court, Rules 7.950–7.955 and
Probate Code §§ 2504, et seq. Cal.
Rules of Court, Rule 7.950 provides that a petition “must be verified by the
petitioner and must contain a full disclosure of all information that has any
bearing upon the reasonableness of the compromise.” Rule 7.950 states that the
Petition must be filed on Judicial Council Form MC-350.
In addition to
approval of the settlement, attorney fees to be paid for representing the minor
or incompetent must be approved by the court. (Fam. Code, § 6602; Prob.
Code, § 3601.)  The court must use a
reasonable fee standard when approving and allowing the amount of attorney's
fees payable from money or property paid or to be paid for the benefit of a
minor or a person with a disability. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 7.955(a)-(b).)
The court reviewed the petitions and
settlements and finds that they are fair and reasonable. The petitions herein were
properly filed on the Judicial Council Forms and are verified. (Petitions, p.
10.) Petitioners properly include in sections 10 and 11 of the MC-350 form the
total amount settled for all Plaintiffs, $50,000, and the amount paid to each
claimant, $2,500, by Defendants Alvarado Equities LLC and JNM Realty Inc. Sections
14-17 show that the claimants would each receive a net payment of $1,613.82,
after total attorney’s fees and expenses (other than medical). The petitions
indicate no medical expenses. (Id., § 12.)
The petitions show that Claimants agreed
to settle their claims arising out of Defendant’s alleged improper maintenance
of the subject property, resulting in insect infestations, unsanitary
conditions, damaged, and general dilapidation/improper maintenance. (Petitions,
§ 5.) The Claimants’ injuries include damages to personal property, personal
injury, emotional distress, pain, anxiety, discomfort, annoyance,
inconvenience, diminishment in the value of their leasehold, rent abatement,
restitution of all rents paid.. (Id., § 6.) The Claimants did not
receive any care and treatment for the injuries. (Id., § 7.) Claimants have
recovered completely from the effects of the injuries, with no permanent
injuries. (Id., § 8(a).)
The amount of attorney’s fees requested
for each claimant is $625 for each claimant. (Petitions, § 13(a).) Hence, the
amount of attorney’s fees is approximately 25 percent of the recovery for each
claimant. Petitioners are requesting for costs of $261.18 for each claimant. (Id.,
§ 13(b).) Counsel has provided a declaration and the retainer fee agreement. The
Court finds the attorney’s fees and costs reasonable. 
However, it is unclear why Defendants
Alvarado Equities LLC and JNM Realty Inc. are paying $18,250 in attorney fees
to Plaintiffs’ counsel and how that is appropriate. (Petitions, § 17(f).) 
Based on the
foregoing, the court CONTINUES
the petitions for counsel to explain the $18,250 in anticipated fees.
 
It is so
ordered.
