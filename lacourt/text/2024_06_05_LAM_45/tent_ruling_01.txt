Background
- 
            This
instant matter, case no. 21STCV20050,
has been consolidated with a related matter, case no. 21STCV26774. Both matters
arise out of similar facts.
            On July 21, 2021, Genetixs, LLC, a
business licensed to engage in the lawful business of cultivation,
distribution, and sales of cannabis, filed a Complaint containing twelve causes
of action against several defendants, including SLW Holdings, LLC (Plaintiff/Cross-Complainant,
hereinafter, “SLW”.) On April 20, 2023, SLW Holdings, LLC filed their Second
Amended Complaint (SAC) against several defendants including GGC Group, LLC
(hereinafter, GGC). The complaints stem from allegations by SLW against Defendant
of fraud, while Genetixs, LLC in turn alleges fraud against SLW. 
            The two motions before the Court is (1)
SLW’s Motion to Compel
Responses to the SLW’s Form Interrogatories (Set 1) and (2) SLW’s Motion to Compel Responses to the SLW’s Special
Interrogatories (Set 1) (hereinafter, the Motions). GGC opposes both Motions[1].              
Discussion – 
Legal Standard
            If
a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response,
the propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and for a
monetary sanction. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subds. (b), (c).) Failure to
timely respond waives all objections, including privilege and work product,
unless “[t]he party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial
compliance” and “[t]he party’s failure to serve a timely response was the
result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (CCP § 2030.290, subds.
(a)(1), (a)(2).) The statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel
where no responses have been served and no meet and confer is required when a
party does not respond to discovery requests. All that need be shown in the
moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the
opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of
any kind has been served. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d
902, 905-906.)
Analysis
            Attached to the moving papers, SLW
submits the Declaration of Raphael B. Emanuel (Emanuel Decl.) which states that
on August 3, 2023, SLW served Defendant with both Form Interrogatories and
Special Interrogatories and that responses were due on September 5, 2023.
(Emanuel Decl., ¶¶3-4.) On September 5, 2023, Defense counsel Ché Hashim
requested an extension, which was granted by SLW’s counsel, yielding a new
deadline of September 26, 2023. (Emanuel Decl., ¶5.) However, when the
September 26, 2023 deadline came, no responses were provided. As of the date of
the instant Motions, November 14, 2023 no responses had been provided. 
            Upon opposition, Defendant argues
that (1) responses were provided on February 12, 2024 and (2) that sanctions
should not be awarded because SLW cannot prevail on either Motion. 
            Although responses were provided on
February 12, 2024, even if discovery responses have been served, the Court can
still award sanctions. (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific
Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 407.)        Next, GGC provides no explanation for why
it took GGC until February 12, 2024 for deliver responses. The first missed
deadline was September 26, 2023. GGC then became explicitly aware that
responses were missing after the Motions were filed on November 14, 2023. This
is a total of five months where responses were never provided. GGC is silent as
how this occurred. Accordingly, the Motion is denied
as moot, however, sanctions are warranted. 
Sanctions
            SLW’s
counsel provides the following calculations:
·        
Counsel’s rate is $450 per hour
·        
Counsel spent 3.5 hours drafting
the Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, and 2 hours drafting
the Motion to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories. 
·        
Counsel anticipated 2 hours to
review opposition paper and draft reply papers.
·        
Counsel also anticipates 1.5 hours
at the hearing.
Considering the similarities between the
Motions and that no reply was filed, the Court will impose sanctions against
GGC, and award them to SLW in the amount of $2,370.00.    
Conclusion - 
            Accordingly,
the motions are DENIED as moot, however, the
requests for monetary sanctions are GRANTED. Sanctions will be
granted to SLW and be imposed on GGC in the amount of $2,370.00.
 
            It
is so ordered.
