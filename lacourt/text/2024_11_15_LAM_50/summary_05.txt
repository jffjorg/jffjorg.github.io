And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the application of attorney Amanda Noonan to appear as counsel pro hac vice on behalf of Defendant Lucky Opco, LLC. The court notes two defects with the application: Noonan did not explicitly state that she is not a resident of California, and her complete residence address was not provided. As a result, the court denies the application without prejudice, meaning Noonan can reapply with the necessary information. The defendant is ordered to provide notice of this ruling to the plaintiff.
