  ORDER RE:  
 
MOTION FOR
  APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT OF LABOR CODE § 2698, et seq.
  PRIVATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL ACT (“PAGA”) CLAIMS 



            
Background
On
May 16, 2022, Plaintiffs Noel Van Wagner and Veronica Andrade (jointly,
“Plaintiffs”) filed this action against Defendant Westlake Properties, Inc. 
The
Complaint alleges causes of action for (1) whistleblower retaliation, (2)
failure to provide meal periods, (3) failure to provide rest periods, (4)
failure to reimburse employment-related expenses, (5) failure to pay overtime
wages, (6) failure to provide accurate wage statements, (7) failure to pay
wages on time, (8) failure to provide employment records, 
(9) unfair
business practices, and (10) violations of the Labor Code under the Private
Attorneys General Act. 
Plaintiffs
previously indicated that the parties entered into a PAGA Settlement and
Release Agreement in this action. (See September 4, 2024 Order.) Plaintiffs
moved for an order approving the parties’ settlement. On September 4, 2024, the
Court issued an Order denying Plaintiffs’ motion without prejudice. 
Plaintiffs now move again for an
order approving the settlement. The motion is unopposed.  
Discussion
A
superior court must “review and approve any settlement of any civil action
filed pursuant to this part.” (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd.
(s)(2).) 
The
Court notes that though there is no statutory or common law standard for
approval of a PAGA settlement, the standard used for approval of class action settlements
is instructive. “[A] presumption of fairness exists where:
(1) the settlement is reached through arm’s-length bargaining; (2)
investigation and discovery are sufficient to allow counsel and the court to
act intelligently; (3) counsel is experienced in similar litigation; and (4)
the percentage of objectors is small.” ((Dunk v. Ford Motor Co. (1996) 48
Cal.App.4th 1794, 1802.) The last factor, small percentage of objectors, is
inapplicable to PAGA claims. ((See Arias v. Superior Court (2009) 46 Cal.4th 969, 984-985
[rejecting the argument that representative actions under PAGA violate the due
process rights of “nonparty aggrieved employees who are not given notice of,
and an opportunity to be heard”].) Additional factors that are useful to
consider include the strength of a plaintiff’s case, the risk, expense,
complexity and likely duration of further litigation, the amount offered in
settlement, the extent of discovery completed, and the experience and views of
counsel. ((See
Kullar v. Foot Locker Retail, Inc. (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 116, 128.)
The Court notes that “Exhibit B” to Plaintiffs’ counsel’s October 9,
2024 declaration is a revised PAGA Settlement and Release Agreement. (Lofton
Decl., ¶ 7, Ex. B.)[1] The
Court notes that the PAGA Settlement and Release Agreement attached as “Exhibit
B” to Plaintiffs’ counsel’s October 9, 2024 declaration corrects the defects
identified in the Court’s September 4, 2024 Order on Plaintiffs’ previous
motion.  
The Court’s September 4, 2024 Order also noted certain defects with
Plaintiffs’ previously submitted proposed order. The Court notes that the new
proposed order submitted on October 9, 2024 appears to correct all but one of
the defects identified in the Court’s 
September
4, 2024 Order.  
As stated in the September 4, 2024 Order, Plaintiffs’ previous “proposed
order provides that ‘[t]he Court
further considered the range of settlement amounts and awards of penalties
approved by other courts when considering the value of this settlement under
the PAGA, as well as the defenses to the claims presented.’…However, it does
not appear that Plaintiffs provided any evidence on such points.” (See
September 4, 2024 Order at pp. 3:26-4:3.) The Court notes that the revised
proposed order submitted on October 9, 2024 also provides that 
“[t]he
Court further considered the range of settlement amounts and awards of
penalties approved by other courts when considering the value of this
settlement under the PAGA.” (Proposed Order at p. 2:20-21.) However, it still
does not appear that Plaintiffs provided any evidence regarding the range of
settlement amounts and awards of penalties approved by other courts. 
            The Court also notes that the October 9, 2024 proposed order
provides that “[t]he Court considered evidence presented regarding…the…expense…and
complexity of the claims presented,” and “the likely duration of further
litigation.” (Proposed Order at p. 2:17-19.) However, it does not appear that
Plaintiffs provided any evidence on these points. In addition, the Court notes
that the October 9, 2024 proposed order incorrectly references a “January 2,
2025” hearing date. (Proposed Order, p.
1:22.) 
            Conclusion
            Based on the foregoing, the Court intends
to grant Plaintiffs’ motion for approval of settlement of Private Attorneys
General Act claims if Plaintiffs comply with the provisions of the following
paragraph:
On
or before __________, 2024, Plaintiffs shall file a revised proposed order and
any necessary supporting documentation to address the remaining issues
identified above. 
Plaintiffs are
ordered to provide notice of this ruling.
