[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:
 
VERIFIED APPLICATION OF AMANDA NOONAN TO APPEAR AS COUNSEL PRO HAC
  VICE



 
Attorney Amanda Noonan applies for an order permitting her to appear pro
hac vice on behalf of Defendant Lucky Opco, LLC (“Defendant”) in the
instant action.
The Court notes a few defects with the
application. 
First, pursuant to California
Rules of Court, rule 9.40, subdivisions (a)(1)-(2), no person is eligible
to appear as counsel pro hac vice if the person is “[a] resident
of the State of California” or “[r]egularly
employed in the State of California.” Although Ms. Noonan states
that she is “not regularly engaged in the practice of law in California” (Noonan Decl., ¶ 3), she
does not appear to expressly state that both of the circumstances set forth in California Rules of Court, rule 9.40, subdivisions (a)(1)-(2)
do not apply to her.  
Second, pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 9.40,
subdivision (d)(1), “[t]he application must state: (1) The applicant’s residence
and office address.” Ms. Noonan’s
complete residence address is not provided. (See Noonan Decl., ¶ 2.) 
based on the foregoing, Ms. Noonan’s
application is denied without prejudice.  
Defendant is ordered to provide notice of this ruling.
