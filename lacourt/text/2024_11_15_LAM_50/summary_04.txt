And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the Moving Parties. The plaintiff alleges that her husband wanted to purchase a property as a home for her, and that a Grant Deed was recorded transferring title to the defendant Masis Tamazyan in 1998. The Moving Parties argue that the plaintiff's resulting trust claim is barred by a four-year statute of limitations, but the court finds that this argument is unclear and unclearly supported by case law. The Moving Parties also argue that the plaintiff's husband is deceased and cannot be joined as a party, but the court finds that this is a factual argument that is not appropriate on a motion for judgment on the pleadings. The court notes that the complaint does not appear to allege that the plaintiff's husband is deceased. The judge is considering whether to grant the motion or to deny it and allow the case to proceed to trial.
