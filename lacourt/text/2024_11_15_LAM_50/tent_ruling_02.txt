[1]Certain signature
blocks contained in this PAGA Settlement and Release Agreement are dated
October 8, 2024 and October 9, 2024. (Lofton Decl., ¶ 7, Ex. B.) This follows
the Court’s September 4, 2024 Order on the previous settlement agreement. The
Court also notes that some of the dates next to certain signatures appear to
list the incorrect year “2014.” (Lofton Decl., ¶ 7, Ex. B.)
