[1]As discussed above, Plaintiff alleges that “[o]n or
about March 24, 1998, Plaintiff’s husband wanted to purchase the subject
property as a home for Plaintiff,” and that “[o]n March 26, 1998, a Grant Deed
was recorded transferring title of the subject property to Defendant Masis
Tamazyan…” (Compl., ¶¶ 7, 11.) 
 


[2]The Moving Parties also appear to cite to Hobart v. Hobart Estate
Co., supra,
26 Cal.2d 412 for the proposition that
“[t]he limitations period is…four years for contract.” It does not appear that
the Hobart Court discussed any such limitations period. It is unclear
what purported limitations period the Moving Parties are referring to. 


[3]In the reply, the Moving Parties agree “[a] resulting
trust claim has a four-year statute of limitations running from the repudiation
of the trust.” (Reply at p. 4:9-10.) 
 


[4]The Moving Parties also argue that “because Plaintiff’s
husband is deceased, he cannot be joined as a party…The inability to join
Plaintiff’s husband or his estate in this action further dooms Plaintiff’s
resulting trust claim.” (Mot. at p. 7:16-20.) The Court finds that this is a
factual argument that is not appropriate on a motion for judgment on the
pleadings. The Complaint does not appear to allege that “Plaintiff’s husband is
deceased.” (Mot. at p. 7:16.) As discussed above, Code
of Civil Procedure section 438, subdivision (d) provides that “[t]he
grounds for motion provided for in this section shall appear on the face of the
challenged pleading or from any matter of which the court is required to take
judicial notice.” 
 


[5]As discussed, the Complaint alleges that “[o]n
December 21, 2020, Defendant Masis Tahmazian signed an lnterspousal Transfer
Grant Deed giving the subject property to his wife Defendant Elen Tahmasian,”
and that “[o]n August 23, 2021, Plaintiff recorded her Deed of Trust.” (Compl.,
¶¶ 13, 15.) 
 


[6]The Moving Parties again cite to Hobart v. Hobart Estate
Co., supra,
26 Cal.2d 412, which does not appear to discuss
any four-year limitations period.
