[TENTATIVE RULING
DEMURRER]
RELIEF REQUESTED
The first page of Cross-Defendant’s (Gary Lefkowitz) demurrer states, “Please
take notice that Lefkowitz is filing a Demurrer to the Third Amended Complaint
filed by Tawansy.” (Dem. p. 1.)
[The
Court notes that this is Lefkowitz’s demurrer to the Third Amended Cross-Complaint
(TACC) filed by Tawansy, not the Third Amended Complaint.]
[The
Court notes that Cross-Defendant’s caption indicated that this is a demurrer
and a motion to strike, but no motion to strike was ever filed.]

Proof of Service Timely Filed (CRC Rule 3.1300): Ok
16/21 Court Days Lapsed (CCP § 1005(b)): Ok
Proper Address (CCP § 1013, § 1013a, § 1013b): Cross-Defendant served Cross-Complainant’s
attorney at wfclark@verizon.net. However, on eCourt, Cross-Complainant’s
attorney’s email address is listed as wfclarklaw@verizon.net. Although
Cross-Defendant appeared to serve the incorrect email address, Cross-Complainant
still appears to have received the demurrer because an opposition was filed by
Cross-Complainant.
Meet and Confer
A party filing a
demurrer “shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who
filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining
whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be
raised in the demurrer.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).)  “The
parties shall meet and confer at least five days before the date the responsive
pleading is due. If the parties are not able to meet and confer at least five
days prior to the date the responsive pleading is due, the demurring party
shall be granted an automatic 30-day extension of time within which to file a
responsive pleading, by filing and serving, on or before the date on which a
demurrer would be due, a declaration stating under penalty of perjury that a
good faith attempt to meet and confer was made and explaining the reasons why
the parties could not meet and confer.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(2).) 
Failure
to sufficiently meet and confer is not grounds to overrule or sustain a
demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a)(4).)
Here,
Cross-Defendant did not file a declaration alleging that a meet and confer
occurred. 
The
Court will still hear this demurrer.
BACKGROUND
Cross-Complainant,
Khaled A. Tawansy, filed the SACC (Second Amended Cross-Complaint) on
11/09/2021. On 12/22/2023, this Court granted Cross-Defendant, Gary Lefkowitz’s,
motion to set aside the default entered on 5/6/2022 as to Tawansy’s SACC.
Further,
this Court notes how on 6/1/2023, the Court noted how “Lefkowitz's 3rd amended
complaint was dismissed on 4/22/2022. The appeal was dismissed and the
remittitur was issued. Lefkowitz's cross-complaint was dismissed on 8/10/2020
and his default was taken on 5/6/2022 in the cross-complaint filed by Tawnsey.”
(6/1/2023 Min. Order, p. 1.)
Cross-Complainant,
Khaled A. Tawansy, filed his SACC on 11/9/2021 against Cross-Defendants Gary
Lefkowitz, Franciska K. Von Andrassy, Swiss Corrective Skin Care, LLC. The SACC
alleges six causes of action for: (1) Breach of Oral Contract, (2) Breach of
Contract Implied in Fact, (3) Breach of Implied-In-Law Contract, (4) Breach of
Fiduciary Duty, (5) Conversion, and (6) Accounting.
On
5/24/2024, this Court heard Cross-Defendant’s demurrer to the SACC. The Court sustained
Cross-Defendant’s demurrer to the first cause of action with leave to amend
granted. The Court overruled the demurrer as to all other causes of action.
On
6/5/2024, Cross-Complainant, Khaled A. Tawansy (Tawansy), filed the Third
Amended Cross-Complaint (TACC) against Cross-Defendants Gary Lefkowitz, Franciska
K. Von Andrassy, and Swiss Corrective Skin Care, LLC.
The
TACC alleges six causes of action for: (1) Breach of Oral Contract, (2) Breach
of Contract Implied in Fact, (3) Breach of Implied-In-Law Contract, (4) Breach
of Fiduciary Duty, (5) Conversion, and (6) Accounting.
Cross-Defendant,
Gary Lefkowitz (Movant), now demurs to the TACC.
Cross-Complainant
alleges that Cross-Defendants received approximately $2,000,000 in funds
belonging to Cross-Complainant. (TACC ¶ 7.) Cross-Complainant alleges that
Cross-Defendants orally agreed to hold Cross-Complainant’s funds for
Cross-Complainant’s benefit, to expend those funds only as authorized by
Cross-Complainant, and to account for the funds held by them. (See TACC. ¶¶ 15
& 25.) Cross-Complainant alleges that while Cross-Defendants used some of
Cross-Complainant’s funds to pay for legitimate expenses of Cross-Complainant
and his business, Cross-Defendants’ used some of the funds of the
Cross-Complainant for their own purposes, converting those funds to their own
use and benefit. (TACC. ¶ 14.) Cross-Complainant  alleges that on or about October 2018,
Cross-Complainant demanded return of all monies being held by Cross-Defendants,
but Cross-Defendants failed and refused to pay or return the balance to
Cross-Complainant. (TACC. ¶ 19.)
LEGAL STANDARDS FOR DEMURRERS
Demurrer
– Sufficiency
A demurrer for
sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda, (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th
740, 747.)  When considering demurrers,
courts read the allegations liberally and in context.  (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of
Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)  The court “treat[s]
the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law ….”  (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152
Cal.App.4th 518, 525.)  In a demurrer
proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via
proper judicial notice.  (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and
not the evidence or other extrinsic matters; therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.30, 430.70.)  The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing
is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at
747.)  
The
general rule is that the plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts, not
evidentiary facts.  (Doe v. City of
Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550.) 
“All that is required of a plaintiff, as a matter of pleading … is that
his complaint set forth the essential facts of the case with reasonable
precision and with sufficient particularity to acquaint the defendant with the
nature, source and extent of his cause of action.”  (Rannard v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp.
(1945) 26 Cal.2d 149, 156-157.)  
On
demurrer, a trial court has an independent duty to “determine whether or not
the … complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action under any
legal theory.”  (Das v. Bank of
America, N.A. (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 727, 734.)  Demurrers do not lie as to only parts of
causes of action, where some valid claim is alleged but “must dispose of an
entire cause of action to be sustained.” 
(Poizner v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97,
119.)  “Generally
it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if
there is any reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by
amendment.”  (Goodman v. Kennedy
(1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.)
Demurrer – Uncertainty
A special demurrer for
uncertainty, CCP section 430.10(f), is disfavored and will only be sustained
where the pleading is so bad that defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e.,
cannot reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or
claims are directed against him/her.  (Khoury v. Maly’s of Calif., Inc. (1993)
14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)  Moreover, even if the pleading is somewhat
vague, “ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Ibid.)
ANALYSIS
Preliminary
Matters
Cross-Defendant’s
demurrer is not the model of clarity.
“A
notice of motion must state in the opening paragraph the nature of the order
being sought and the grounds for issuance of the order.” (Cal Rules of Court,
Rule 3.1110(a).)
Page
2 of Cross-Defendant’s demurrer appears to be the notice page of the demurrer.
Despite this page stating that the demurrer is made on two fundamental grounds
– (1) Tawansy has no ability to bring this action and (2) Each cause of action
is barred by the statute of limitations – the demurrer asserts several jumbled
arguments not related to the two fundamental grounds that Cross-Defendant
mentioned. 
Many
times throughout the demurrer, the demurrer asserts incomprehensible arguments
that are not supported with legal authority.
First Cause of Action – Breach of Oral Contract
Cross-Defendant appears
to demur to the breach of oral contract claim on several grounds.
The
elements of a breach of oral contract cause are: (1) existence of the contract;
(2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance; (3) defendant’s
breach; and (4) damages to plaintiff as a result of the breach. (Aton
Center, Inc. v. United Healthcare Ins. Co. (2023) 93 Cal.App.5th 1214, 1230
citing CDF Firefighters v. Maldonado (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1226, 1239
and Stockton Mortgage, Inc. v. Tope (2014) 233 Cal.App.4th 437, 453.)
Terms of Contract
Lefkowitz
appears to be attacking the first element of “existence of the contract” by
arguing that the TACC does not state the terms of the agreement. 
The
Court finds Lefkowitz’s argument unavailing.
A
cause of action for breach of contract is subject to demurrer if “it cannot be
ascertained from the pleading whether the contract is written, is oral, or is
implied by conduct.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10(g).) An allegation of an oral
agreement must “set[] forth the substance of its relative terms.” (Gautier
v. General Tel. Co. (1965) 234 Cal.App.2d 302, 305.) “An oral contract may
be pleaded generally as to its effect, because it is rarely possible to allege
the exact words.” (Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc. (1993) 14
Cal.App.4th 612, 616 citing 4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Pleading, §
471, p. 509.)
Here,
Cross-Complainant appears to have alleged the existence of an oral contract and
set forth the substance of its relative terms in ¶ 25 of the TACC by alleging,
“On or about December 18, 2015, Cross-Defendants entered into an oral contract
with the Cross-Complainant to hold Cross-Complainant's funds for his use and
benefit, to expend those funds only as authorized by him and for his benefit,
and to account for the funds held by them.” (TACC. ¶ 25.)
Consideration
Lefkowitz
also appears to be attacking the first element of “existence of the contract”
by arguing that there is no discussion as to the consideration to be paid or
the liabilities of each party.
The
Court does not find this argument on consideration availing. 
Lefkowitz
cites no authority that consideration must be alleged. 
Below,
the Court cites Lefkowitz to a few cases.
“Where
the existence of a contract is at issue and the evidence is conflicting or
admits of more than one inference, it is for the trier of fact to determine
whether the contract actually existed. But if the material facts are certain or
undisputed, the existence of a contract is a question for the court to decide.”
(HM DG, Inc. v. Amini (2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 1100, 1109.)
Further,
“…[T]he question of adequacy of consideration is generally considered as a
question of fact…” (Henderson v. Fisher (1965) 236 Cal.App.2d 468, 475.)
The
court “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,
but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law ….”  (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152
Cal.App.4th 518, 525.)
Privity of Contract
Cross-Defendant
argues that Cross-Complainant does not have a cause of action for breach of
oral contract because there is no privity of contract with Cross-Complainant
Tawansy.
Cross-Defendant’s
argument on privity of contract appears to be based on the background factual
allegations in the TACC that describe how Cross-Defendants ended up in
possession of Cross-Complainant’s money.
In
the TACC, Cross-Complainant alleges that Cross-Defendants obtained his money
by:
1.     
Cross-Complainant transferring $2,000,000 to his wholly owned and
managed entity, Renaissance Surgical Holdings, LLC.


2.     
Renaissance Surgical Holdings LLC received the money on
Cross-Complainant’s behalf, acting as his agent.


3.     
Renaissance Surgical Holdings LLC transferred the money to
Cross-Complainant’s attorney, Donald E. Karpel.


4.     
Donald E. Karpel transferred the funds to Swiss Corrective Skin
Care LLC (a Cross-Defendant)


5.     
The sums of $524,000 and $976,000 (totaling $1,500,00) were
transferred from Swiss Corrective Skin Care LLC (a Cross-Defendant) to 95 N.
Arroyo, LLC (another entity wholly owned and managed by Cross-Complainant; 95
N. Arroyo LLC received the funds on behalf of the Cross-Complainant acting as
his agent)


6.     
The sum of $1,755,000 was transferred back from 95 N. Arroyo to
Swiss Corrective Skin Care LLC (a Cross-Defendant)
(See
TACC. ¶¶ 8-10.)
[The Court notes that it is unclear from the TACC how
Cross-Complainant alleges that $1,755,000 was transferred from 95 N. Arroyo to
Swiss Corrective Skin Care when the TACC alleges that 95 N. Arroyo only
previously received $1,500,000 (524,000 + 976,000) from Swiss Corrective Skin
Care. See TACC ¶ 9.]
Cross-Defendant appears to be arguing that
Cross-Complainant Tawansy does not have privity of contract with Cross-Defendants
because the money came from Renaissance Surgical Holdings LLC and 95 N. Arroyo,
not Cross-Complainant Tawansy. Cross-Defendant cites to Republic Indemnity
Co. v. Schofield (1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 220, 227 which states, “Someone who
is not a party to a contract has no standing to enforce the contract or to
recover extra-contract damages for wrongful withholding of benefits to the
contracting party.” (Id.)
Cross-Defendant’s argument that Cross-Complainant
Tawansy does not have privity of contract with Cross-Defendants is unavailing
for several reasons.
First, Cross-Defendant appears to be under the
assumption that because Cross-Complainant attached some of the checks to the
TACC, those checks form the contract, and since those checks don’t have
Cross-Complainant’s name on them, Cross-Complainant does not have privity of
contract. 
Cross-Defendant’s assumption is incorrect. 
Paragraph 25 of the TACC alleges that Cross-Defendants
and Cross-Complainant entered into an oral contract. The Court must assume the
truth of these allegations at the pleading stage. Further, the first cause of
action does not state that the checks attached to the TACC are the contract.
While it is entirely unclear as to why Cross-Complainant attached these checks
to the TACC, it appears irrelevant because Cross-Complainant does not allege that
these checks attached to the TACC are the contract.
Further, even if the Court assumes the truth of
Cross-Defendant’s bizarre and incorrect logic that the checks attached to the
TACC are the contract, even though the checks don’t have Tawansy’s name on
them, this does not appear as if it means that Tawansy does not have privity of
contract. Cross-Defendant argues that there is no privity of contract with
Tawansy because the money came from Renaissance Surgical Holdings LLC and 95 N.
Arroyo. However, Cross-Complainant’s TACC alleges that both Renaissance
Surgical Holdings LLC and 95 N. Arroyo LLC are wholly owned and managed by
Cross-Complainant and received the funds on his behalf acting as his agent.
(See ¶¶ 8-10.)
As stated in American Builder’s Assn. v. Au-Yang (1990)
226 Cal.App.3d 170, 176:
“An agent represents his principal for all
purposes within the scope of his actual or ostensible authority, and all
the rights and liabilities which would accrue to the agent from
transactions within such limit, if they had been entered into on his own
account, accrue to the principal.” (Civ.Code, § 2330, italics
added.)
“A contract made by an agent for an undisclosed
principal is for most purposes the contract of the principal,
...” (Bank of America v. State Bd. of Equal. (1962) 209
Cal.App.2d 780, 796, 26 Cal.Rptr. 348, italics added.) Unless excluded by
the terms of the agreement made by the agent, an undisclosed principal may
claim the benefits of the contract and may sue or be sued in his or her own
name. (Schader v. White (1916) 173 Cal. 441, 445, 160 P.
557; Cowan v. Tremble (1931) 111 Cal.App. 458, 462, 296 P.
91; Purviance v. Shostak (1949) 90 Cal.App.2d 295, 297, 202
P.2d 755; Sumner v. Flowers (1955) 130 Cal.App.2d 672, 675,
279 P.2d 772; Wood Bldg. Corp. v. Griffitts (1958) 164
Cal.App.2d 559, 562, 330 P.2d 847; 2 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed.
1987) Agency and Employment, § 110, pp. 105–106.)
(American Builder’s
Assn. v. Au-Yang (1990) 226 Cal.App.3d 170, 176.)
As to alleging agency at
the pleading stage, “An allegation of agency is an allegation of ultimate fact
that must be accepted as true for purposes of ruling on a demurrer.” (City
of Industry v. City of Filmore (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 191, 212-13.) “We
have already noted, however, that an allegation of agency as such is a
statement of ultimate fact. Consequently further allegations explaining how
this fact of agency originated become unnecessary.” (Skopp v. Weaver (1976)
16 Cal.3d 432, 439.)
Therefore,
Cross-Defendant’s argument that Cross-Complainant Tawansy does not have privity
of contract in this action is unavailing. 
Statute
of Limitations
Cross-Defendant argues
that because the TACC alleges that funds were transferred to Cross-Defendant
Swiss Corrective Skin Care on December 18, 2015, and because funds were
transferred from Swiss Corrective Skin Care to 95 N. Arroyo LLC on June 6,
2016, and because funds were transferred to by 95 N. Arroyo LLC to Swiss
Corrective Skin Care on January 25, 2017, this action is thus barred under the
two-year statute of limitations under CCP § 339 because all of those
transactions occurred beyond 2 years ago.
Shockingly, Cross-Complainant’s
Opposition does not provide any legal arguments as to why this action is not
barred by the statute of limitations. 
The Court notes that Cross-Defendant’s
argument on the statute of limitations appears to have some glaringly obvious problems.
Cross-Defendant provides zero
legal authority as to many issues that would very clearly be relevant in
determining if the statute of limitations actually ran here. For example,
Cross-Defendant provides no legal authority as to when the statute of
limitations begins to run in a breach of contract cause of action, if the
running of the statute of limitations is stopped when a complaint is filed, and
when the statute of limitations ran in the instant case. 
Through no help of either
Cross-Defendant or Cross-Complaint, it appears as if the statute of limitations
did not run in the instant scenario, and Cross-Complainant’s breach of oral
contract claim is not barred by the statute of limitations.
“A demurrer based on a
statute of limitations will not lie where the action may be, but is not
necessarily, barred. [Citation.] In order for the bar ... to be raised by
demurrer, the defect must clearly and affirmatively appear on the face of the
complaint; it is not enough that the complaint shows that the action may be
barred.” (Committee for Green Foothills v. Santa Clara County Bd. Of
Supervisor (2010) 48 Cal.4th 32, 42 quoting Geneva Towers Ltd.
Partnership v. City and County of San Francisco (2003) 29 Cal.4th 769,
781.)
Sections 335 – 349.4 are
located in Chapter 3 of Title 2, Part 2, of the Code of Civil Procedure, and these
sections in Chapter 3 are titled “The Time of Commencing Actions Other Than for
the Recovery of Real Property.”
An oral contract appears
to have a two year statute of limitations:
The periods prescribed for the
commencement of actions other than for the recovery of real property, are as
follows:
Within two years: 1. An action upon a
contract, obligation or liability not founded upon an instrument of writing,
except as provided in Section 2725 of the Commercial Code or subdivision 2 of
Section 337 of this code; or an action founded upon a contract, obligation or
liability, evidenced by a certificate, or abstract or guaranty of title of real
property, or by a policy of title insurance; provided, that the cause of action
upon a contract, obligation or liability evidenced by a certificate, or abstract
or guaranty of title of real property or policy of title insurance shall not be
deemed to have accrued until the discovery of the loss or damage suffered by
the aggrieved party thereunder.
(CCP §§ 335 & 339.)
“The statute of
limitations for a breach of contract claim begins to run at the time of breach
(that is, when one party fails to perform as contractually required).” (Piedmont
Capital Management, L.L.C. v. McElfish (2023) 94 Cal.App.5th 961, 964.)
Here, Cross-Complainant
alleges breach on or about October 2018 when Cross-Complainant demanded the
return of their money and Cross-Defendants did not return the money. (See TACC
¶ 26.)
Therefore, it appears as
if Cross-Complainant would have had to have filed this action before October
2020.
Although the instant TACC
was not filed until 6/5/2024, the Court reminds the Cross-Defendant that this
is the third amended cross-complaint. 
The initial
cross-complaint filed by Tawansy against Cross-Defendants Lefkowitz, Franciska
K. Von Andrassy, and Swiss Corrective Skin Care LLC was filed on 4/30/2019.
“In civil actions, “[a]n
action is commenced …when the complaint is filed.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 350.)
And the statue of limitations in civil actions stops running the moment the
complaint is filed, not when it is served.” (Straley v. Gamble (2013)
217 Cal.App.4th 533, 538.)
Here, the initial
cross-complaint was filed on 4/30/2019; therefore, it appears as if this is the
date that the statute of limitations stopped running. This date of 4/30/2019
precedes October 2020 (two years after the breach in October 2018); therefore,
this action is timely.
Cross-Defendant’s
argument that the statute of limitations ran on the breach of oral contract
claim is thus unavailing. 
TENTATIVE RULING FIRST
CAUSE OF ACTION BREACH OF ORAL CONTRACT
Cross-Defendant’s
demurrer to the first cause of action for breach of oral contract is OVERRULED.
Cross-Complainant alleged the elements of a breach of oral contract cause of
action in ¶¶ 7-28 of the TACC. 
TENTATIVE RULING
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION – BREACH OF IMPLIED-IN-FACT CONTRACT
Most
of Cross-Defendant’s argument as to the second cause of action are borderline
incomprehensible. 
In addition to the
incomprehensible arguments, Cross-Defendant appears to argue that the two-year
statute of limitations ran; however, the Court already rejected
Cross-Defendant’s statute of limitations argument as explained above. 
Cross-Defendant’s
arguments on privity of contract were also already rejected by this Court as
explained above.
Cross-Defendant’s
demurrer to the second cause of action is OVERRULED.
TENTATIVE RULING QUANTUM
MERUIT AND UNJUST ENRICHMENT
Lefkowitz
has a section on page 6 of his demurrer on unjust enrichment and quantum
meruit. It is unclear why this section is in the demurrer because the TACC does
not allege causes of action for unjust enrichment and quantum meruit.
Therefore, whatever Lefkowitz’s argument is, it is unavailing. 
TENTATIVE RULING –
THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION – BREACH OF IMPLIED-IN-LAW CONTRACT
Cross-Defendant
argues that Tawansy lacks privity of contract for this cause of action. The
Court does not find this argument availing, as it already rejected this
argument as described above. 
Cross-Defendant’s
demurrer to the third cause of action is OVERRULED.
TENTATIVE RULING FOURTH
CAUSE OF ACTION BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY
Cross-Defendant’s
demurrer to the fourth cause of action is OVERRULED.
Cross-Defendant asserts
incomprehensible arguments with zero legal authority. 
Cross-Defendant refers to
CCP § 339. It is unclear why Cross-Defendant cited the statute of limitations
for an oral contract when this cause of action is for breach of fiduciary duty.

TENTATIVE RULING
FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION - CONVERSION
Cross-Defendant asserts
that this cause of action cannot be brought because Cross-Complainant does not
have privity of contract with Cross-Defendants and because the claim is barred
by the statute of limitations. 
Cross-Defendant’s
demurrer to the fifth cause of action is OVERRULED as described in the Court’s
description above relating to privity of contract and the statute of
limitations. Further, Cross-Defendant doesn’t even state what the statute of
limitations is for a conversion claim and how the statute of limitations ran.
TENTATIVE RULING
SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION – ACCOUNTING
Cross-Defendant
asserts that this cause of action cannot be brought because Cross-Complainant
does not have privity of contract with Cross-Defendants and because the claim
is barred by the statute of limitations. 
Cross-Defendant’s
demurrer to the sixth cause of action is OVERRULED as described in the Court’s
description above relating to privity of contract and the statute of
limitations. Furter, Cross-Defendant doesn’t even state what the statute of
limitations is for an accounting claim and how the statute of limitations ran.
