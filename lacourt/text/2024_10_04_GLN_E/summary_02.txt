Significant Statements:
  - "When a court upon motion of a party or its own motion finds that in the interest of substantial justice an action should be heard in a forum outside this state, the court shall stay or dismiss the action in whole or in part on any conditions that may be just." (CCP ยง 410.30(a))
  - "Forum non conveniens is an equitable doctrine invoking the discretionary power of a court to decline to exercise the jurisdiction it has over a transitory cause of action when it believes that the action may be more appropriately and justly tried elsewhere." (Stangvik v. Shiley, Inc. (1991) 54 Cal. 3d 744, 751)
  - "The private interest factors are those that make trial and the enforceability of the ensuing judgment expeditious and relatively inexpensive, such as the ease of access to sources of proof, the cost of obtaining attendance of witnesses, and the availability of compulsory process for attendance of unwilling witnesses." (Stangvik v. Shiley, Inc. (1991) 54 Cal. 3d 744, 751)
  - "The Court finds some validity to Plaintiff's argument that the identity and location of the witnesses in the trial and throughout discovery is somewhat speculative. However, this speculation appears to cut both ways."
