Although Petitioners’ opening brief refers to discipline of GS’s licensure, the
Petition does not. 


[2] Petitioners admitted to using the term “ranger” on uniforms or patches
for a social media post and for advertisement purposes (AR 1652-54, 1704-06)
and using “ranger patrol” on All Terrain Vehicles used for patrol (AR 1687-89).


[3]
The citations AR 1552, 1553, and 1567 are not in the parties’ joint appendix
and were not verified by the court.


[4]
Petitioners’ opening brief refers to GSS and GST, but no discipline was imposed
against either.  Pet. Op. Br. at 2.


[5]
For convenience, the court will refer to the ALJ’s Proposed Decision rather
than the BSIS’s Decision adopting it.


[6]
ALJ Forman’s concerns about Diehl’s declaration at the ISO hearing are
irrelevant to this issue.


[7]
Petitioners argue that their opening brief cites the Administrative Record 35
times.  Reply at 4, 6.   The citations referred to by Petitioners
were mostly their own evidence or the ALJ’s findings.  Petitioners did not cite any of Complainant’s
evidence on the first cause.
