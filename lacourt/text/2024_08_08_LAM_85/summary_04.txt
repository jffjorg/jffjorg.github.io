And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses the dispute between Moore and the Board regarding Moore's reinstatement to his job. The Judge notes that the proofs of service for the Petition and FAP do not mention a demand for reinstatement, and that service of process for court purposes differs from service under City Charter section 1017. The Judge also finds that the failure to file the Claim for Compensation, which is a condition precedent to recovery of wages or salary, does not affect Moore's right to reinstatement. The Judge therefore intends to rule in favor of Moore's reinstatement, pending further argument at the court hearing.
