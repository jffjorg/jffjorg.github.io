  Case Number:  23STCP04271    Hearing Date:   August 8, 2024    Dept:  85 
Gates
Security, Scott D Wagenseller, et al. v. Bureau of Security and Investigative
Services, 23STCP04271

Tentative decision on petition for administrative mandamus:   denied




 



 
Petitioners Scott D. Wagenseller (“Wagenseller”), Gates
Security (“GS”), Gates Security Training (“GST”), Gates Security Systems (“GSS”)
and Griffen Taylor Dietrich (“Dietrich”) seek administrative mandamus directing
Respondent Bureau of Security and Investigative Services (“BSIS”) to set aside
its ordering revoking, suspending, and placing on probation certain licensure
of Wagenseller, GS, and Diedrich. 
The court has read and considered the moving papers,
opposition, and reply, and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
A. Statement of
the Case
1. Petition
On November 21, 2023, Petitioners Wagenseller, GS, GST, GSS,
and Dietrich filed the Petition against Respondent BSIS for administrative
mandamus.  The Petition alleges in
pertinent part as follows.
Since on or about October 13, 2000, Wagenseller has been the
President, Principal, and Qualified Manager of GS, a private security
corporation located in Thousand Oaks, California.  Pet., ¶¶1-2.
GST has been a licensed training facility with firearm
license number 1067 since on or about October 2, 2001.  Pet., ¶3.
GSS has been an alarm company operator and alarm company
branch licensee from BSIS since on or about March 4, 2004.  Pet., ¶4.
Dietrich holds a security guard registration number, firearm
permit number, and baton permit number from BSIS.  Pet., ¶5. 
Dietrich’s security guard registration was issued on or about November
2, 2015, his firearm permit was issued on or about December 6, 2017, and his baton
permit was issued on or about May 1, 2021. 
Pet., ¶5. 
Wagenseller was issued a firearm permit number from BSIS on
or about February 2, 2018, and a firearm instructor license number on or about
October 1, 2001.  Pet., ¶6.
On August 9 and 10, 2023, Deena R. Ghaly, Administrative Law
Judge (“ALJ”) of the Office of Administrative Hearings (“OAH”) heard the First
Amended Accusation of Complainant BSIS Deputy Chief Samuel Stodolski against Petitioners.  Pet., ¶¶10-11, Ex. A.
On October 16, 2023, the ALJ issued a Proposed Decision to revoke
various licenses of Dietrich, with revocation stayed and all licenses/permits
suspended for 60 days thereafter, followed by probation for three years on
various terms and conditions.  Pet., ¶12.  Only Dietrich received a formal notice from
BSIS.  Pet., ¶13, Ex. C.
Although Wagenseller has not yet received a formal written
notice of BSIS’s Decision and Order regarding his licenses, it is his
understanding that BSIS imposed the same revocation, stay, and suspension with probation
as with Dietrich.  Pet., ¶13.  
Petitioners contend that the 60-day suspension of Dietrich’s
licenses before BSIS will result in a de facto revocation of said licenses, as
he will be unable to provide security services to his clients, thereby
resulting in a loss of all his client accounts and the loss of his job as an
employee of Gates Security.  Pet., ¶16.
Wagenseller contends his lack of formal notice of the
Decision and Order of BSIS with regard to his licenses, which may be effective November
17, 2023, is unconscionably unfair and will result in irreparable harm to his
current and future livelihood.  Pet.,
¶¶17-18, Ex. B.
Wagenseller and Dietrich seek (1) a stay of revocation of
their various licenses held before BSIS, (2) mandamus setting aside BSIS’s
Decision, and (3) attorney fees.  Pet. at
2, 11.[1] 
 
2. Course of Proceedings
On November 28, 2023, the court denied Wagenseller, GS, GST,
GSS, Dietrich’s ex parte application for stay of BSIS’s decision. 
On December 29, 2023, BSIS filed its Answer. 
 
B. Standard of Review
            CCP
section 1094.5 is the administrative mandamus provision which structures the
procedure for judicial review of adjudicatory decisions rendered by
administrative agencies.  Topanga
Ass’n for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles, (“Topanga”)
(1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 514-15.  
            CCP
section 1094.5 does not in its face specify which cases are subject to
independent review, leaving that issue to the courts.  Fukuda v. City of Angels, (“Fukuda”)
(1999) 20 Cal.4th 805, 811.  In cases
reviewing decisions which affect a vested, fundamental right the trial court
exercises independent judgment on the evidence. Bixby v. Pierno, (“Bixby”)
(1971) 4 Cal.3d 130, 143; see CCP
§1094.5(c).  An administrative decision imposing
discipline on a professional licensee is decided under the independent judgment
standard.  Griffiths v. Superior Court, (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 757,
767. 

            Under
the independent judgment test, “the trial court not only examines the
administrative record for errors of law but also exercises its independent
judgment upon the evidence disclosed in a limited trial de novo.”  Bixby, supra, 4 Cal.3d at 143.  The court must draw its own reasonable
inferences from the evidence and make its own credibility determinations.  Morrison v. Housing Authority of the City
of Los Angeles Board of Commissioners, (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 860,
868.  In short, the court substitutes its
judgment for the agency’s regarding the basic facts of what happened, when,
why, and the credibility of witnesses.  Guymon
v. Board of Accountancy, (1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 1010, 1013-16.
            “In
exercising its independent judgment, a trial court must afford a strong
presumption of correctness concerning the administrative findings, and the
party challenging the administrative decision bears the burden of convincing
the court that the administrative findings are contrary to the weight of the
evidence.”  Fukuda, supra, 20 Cal.4th at 817.  Unless it can be demonstrated by petitioner
that the agency’s actions are not grounded upon any reasonable basis in law or
any substantial basis in fact, the courts should not interfere with the
agency’s discretion or substitute their wisdom for that of the agency.  Bixby, supra, 4 Cal.3d 130, 150-51;
Bank of America v. State Water Resources Control Board, (1974) 42
Cal.App.3d 198, 208.
            An
agency is presumed to have regularly performed its official duties (Evid. Code
§664), and the petitioner therefore has the burden of proof.  Steele v. Los Angeles County Civil Service
Commission, (1958) 166 Cal.App.2d 129, 137. 
“[T]he burden of proof falls upon the party attacking the administrative
decision to demonstrate wherein the proceedings were unfair, in excess of
jurisdiction or showed prejudicial abuse of discretion.  Afford v. Pierno, (1972) 27 Cal.App.3d
682, 691. 
The agency’s decision must be based on the evidence
presented at the hearing.  Board of
Medical Quality Assurance v. Superior Court, (1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 860,
862.  The hearing officer is only
required to issue findings that give enough explanation so that parties may
determine whether, and upon what basis, to review the decision. Topanga,
supra, 11 Cal.3d 506, 514-15. 
Implicit in CCP section 1094.5 is a requirement that the agency set
forth findings to bridge the analytic gap between the raw evidence and ultimate
decision or order.  Id. at 115.
            
C. Statement of Facts
1. Petitioners
Wagenseller is the
founder and owner of GS.  AR 1710-11.  Dietrich is the Director of Business
Development for GS and has been for seven years.  AR 1646-47.
As of the date of
the hearing on the Second Amended Accusation (“SAA”), Wagenseller, GS, GST,
GSS, and Dietrich held the following licenses issued by BSIS: (1) GS held
Private Patrol Operator License No. 17191; (2) GSS held Alarm Company Operator
License No. 6002; (3) GST held Training Facility Firearm License No. 1067; (4) Wagenseller
held a Firearm Permit, Baton Permit, Firearm Instructor License, and an Alarm
Company Employee License; and (5) Dietrich held a Security Guard License,
Firearm Permit, and Baton Permit.  AR 558-59,
560, 562.  
 
2. Petition for
Interim Suspension
On April 11, 2023,
Complainant Samuel Stodolski (“Stodolski”), as Deputy Chief of BSIS, filed a
Petition for Interim Suspension (“ISO”) asking the Office of Administrative
Hearings (“OAH”) to suspend all of Petitioners’ licenses pending a hearing on
formal charges that Petitioners practiced in a manner that impersonates
government law enforcement agencies and personnel.  AR 793-94. 
Petitioners opposed the ISO.  AR 799-800.
On May 5, 2023,
after hearing evidence and argument, the OAH issued an ISO imposing license
restrictions on GS, Wagenseller (as qualified manager of GS), and
Dietrich.  AR 789-820.  The ISO ordered Petitioners to take the
following actions: (1) within ten business days, apply “private security” or
“security patrol” signage to GS’s “ranger Patrol” vehicles in lettering visible
from 50 feet away; (2) remove all siren systems in GS vehicles; (3) Wagenseller
and Dietrich, and all employees of GS, are prohibited from openly carrying a
shotgun or rifle on their person or in their vehicle while on duty; and (4)
Wagenseller and all of GS’s security guards shall wear uniforms with BSIS-approved
patches on both shoulders identifying them as employees of GS.  AR 818. 

The ISO specified
that Petitioners’ failure to comply with the terms of the ISO would constitute
a separate cause for disciplinary action against GS and Diedrich.  AR 819.
 
3. The Accusation
On August 4, 2023, Stodolski
filed the SAA against Petitioners alleging 11 causes for discipline.  AR 514-31. 
The SAA alleged, inter alia, a cause for discipline against GS
and Wagenseller for violating the terms of the ISO because Petitioners did not
ensure all vehicles included signage stating “private security” or “security
patrol” in lettering visible from at least 50 feet away (AR 527); two causes
for discipline against GS, Wagenseller, and Diedrich for impersonating law
enforcement personnel or giving the impression of having a connection to law
enforcement based in part on Petitioners’ use of the term “ranger” on uniforms
and vehicles and patrolling public areas (AR 527, 530); two causes against GS,
Wagenseller, and Diedrich for discipline for uniform violations because GS’s employees failed to wear BSIS-approved
patches (AR 527-28); one cause for discipline against Wagenseller for unlawful
carrying of a firearm without a valid and unexpired permit (AR 529); one cause
for discipline against GS for acting outside of the scope of licensure based on
GS employees responding to incidents that do not concern property or things
they were hired to guard or protect (AR 529); and one cause for discipline against
GS for operating under an unauthorized business name by using the name “ranger
Patrol” without written authorization from BSIS (AR 530).
 
4. The Hearing
On August 9 and 10,
2023, the ALJ heard the SAA against Petitioners via videoconference.  See AR 154-84.  
The primary evidence
against Petitioners occurred through the testimony of Investigator Adam Diehl
(“Diehl”).  AR 159-60.  Diehl presented a PowerPoint presentation of
photographs compiled by retired Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority
(“MRCA”) ranger Walt Young (“Young”), who did not testify at the hearing.  AR 159-60. 

 
a. Declaration of Walt
Young
Diehl presented the
declaration of Young with his observations and findings and authenticating a
PowerPoint presentation.  AR 1366-68, 623-68.  
Both Wagenseller
(representing himself and the corporate Petitioners) and Dietrich confirmed
they had no objection to Young’s declaration and PowerPoint presentation.  AR 1367. 
As a result, the declaration was received in evidence.  AR 1367. 
Neither Wagenseller nor Dietrich objected at any point while other
witnesses discussed the declaration and PowerPoint presentation in their
testimony.  See AR 1368-90.  
Young’s declaration
stated that he investigated GS’s operating practices and summarized his
findings in a PowerPoint presentation.  AR
623-24.  To show the similarities between
GS’s vehicles and uniforms and those used by law enforcement agencies, Young’s
PowerPoint included photographs showing side-by-side photographs of GS’s
vehicles and uniforms with those used by government law enforcement agencies.  AR 639, 641-43, 648-49, 663-64.  
Young’s PowerPoint
included copies of Petitioners’ social media posts showing that Petitioners
employed vehicles, uniforms, tactics, and marketing practices that gave the
false impression that they were associated with government law enforcement
agencies.  AR 633-34, 637-38, 646, 656, 659-62,
665-68.
 
b. Adam Diehl
Diehl testified
about his investigation into Petitioners’ activities after BSIS received
complaints from law enforcement agencies and the public expressing confusion
regarding whether Petitioners’ vehicles were associated with government law
enforcement agencies.  AR 672-75, 1421-22,
1424, 1458.
In February 2022, BSIS
received a complaint from Young alleging that Petitioners were impersonating
law enforcement personnel.  AR 572, 1349-50.  Petitioners’ employees wore shirts with the
term “ranger” on the back, which is not permissible under Public Resource (“Pub.
Res.”) Code section 4022.  AR 1371, 614, 634.  Petitioners also used vehicles bearing the
term “ranger patrol,” a fictitious business name not approved by BSIS.  AR 1381, 1405-06.  Diehl opined that BSIS would not approve
terms like “ranger patrol” that are likely to confuse the public into believing
those vehicles are associated with a law enforcement agency.  AR 1349-51. [2]

Additionally, Petitioners’
vehicles were not prominently marked with the words “private security” or
“security patrol” in font large enough to be seen from 50 feet away.  AR001372-74; AR001399- 400; AR001405-06.  Diehl agreed with Young’s opinion that
Petitioners’ vehicles were too similar to law enforcement vehicles such that
the public would be confused.  AR001376-79.  Diehl also agreed with Young’s opinion that
Petitioners’ uniforms were too similar to law enforcement agency uniforms
(Orange County Sheriff and Border Patrol, specifically).  AR001382-83.
BSIS regulates
badges and patches on private patrol uniforms to protect the public and ensure
security guards are clearly identifiable to the public and law enforcement
agencies.  AR 1365, 1373.  Some of Petitioners’ employees wore a
seven-cornered star badge that was not approved because it did not have an
identification number of each individual employee (when that employee is
armed).  AR 587, 1395-96.  Petitioners’ employees were wearing
unapproved shoulder patches that stated “patrol division” instead of “private
security.”  AR 573, 651, 1397.  
Petitioners also responded
to incidents on public roads and areas outside of their clients’ property.  AR 1385-89. 
Diehl explained that this was outside the scope of Petitioners’
licensure because they were only authorized to operate on their client’s
property and/or on the way to those locations. 
AR 1385-89.  Petitioners issued a
citation to a door-to-door salesman, a function that should be solely exercised
by a government law enforcement agency.  AR
676, 1424-25.
Diehl conducted two
field visits to verify Petitioners’ ISO compliance on June 22 and June 27,
2023.  AR 822-23, 828, 831-32, 834, 836, 838,
1442-45, 1447-49.  While some “private
security” signage was placed on the top of the rear bumper on some vehicles,
the signage was not visible from 50 feet away because of where the signage was
applied.  AR 834, 838.
 
c. Darrell
Readyhoff
ranger Darrell
Readyhoff (“Readyhoff”), a senior ranger with the California Department of
Parks and Recreation, testified that he observed GS’s vehicles bearing the “Ranger
Patrol” signage on several occasions.  AR
1510-12.  
Readyhoff conducted a
traffic stop on one of GS’s vehicles on May 13, 2022 because it had the word “ranger”
on it.  AR 1510-12.  Wagenseller was driving the vehicle.  AR 1513. 
Furthermore, Readyhoff observed loaded long guns within the vehicle and
asked Wagenseller to produce his firearm qualification card or some other proof
of authority to carry the firearm.  AR 1514-16.  Wagenseller was only able to produce an
expired permit. AR 1515-16.  Readyhoff
observed that the vehicle’s requisite signage identifying it as private patrol
was too small to be seen from 50 feet away. 
AR 1512-15.  Readyhoff stated that
he would have confused Petitioners’ Ranger Patrol vehicles for law enforcement
vehicles if he did not have prior experience with their vehicles. AR 1512, 1522-23.
 
d. Joseph T.
Edmiston
Joseph T. Edmiston
(“Edmiston”), Chef Executive Officer of MRCA and sworn park ranger, testified
about a public complaint filed with MRCA regarding the conduct of a park
ranger.  AR 1552.   However, MRCA and State Parks did not have
any rangers assigned to the location of the incident involved in the complaint.  AR 1552. 
Edmiston was concerned that the complaint involved the conduct of one of
GS’s employees based on its improper use of the term “ranger.”  AR 1553, 1567.[3]  Edmiston also testified that Petitioners’
badges look very much like law enforcement agency badges.  AR 1560-61. 
He was concerned that GS’s employees could act in ways that would bring
the ranger services into disrepute or endanger the rangers.  AR 1560-61. 

 
5. The Proposed
Decision
After the hearing
was complete, the ALJ issued a Proposed Decision.  AR 19-218. 
The ALJ’s factual findings set forth the various licenses held by GS,
GSS, GST, Wagenseller, and Dietrich.  AR
191-93.  The investigation commenced when
complaints were received that GS operated in a manner that gave the impression
it was a law enforcement agency.  AR 193.  
A specific complaint
was made by MCRA ranger Young who reported that MRCA personnel reported seeing
GS personnel in uniforms and vehicles that looked like law enforcement
agencies.  AR 193.  Young made a PowerPoint that should Dietrich
wearing a “ranger” shirt, a GS SUV with a six-point star design not approved by
BSIS, vehicles without “private security” or “security patrol” on them, and
ATVs marked with “ranger”.  AR 194.  The PowerPoint showed GS personnel
handcuffing a person from a ride-along on a non-client call, and other social
media marketing.  AR 195.
BSIS investigated
with a focus of whether Petitioners were using names or wording in the business
likely to mislead the public that GS is a law enforcement agency.  AR 196. 
On May 5, 2023, an ALJ issued the ISO requiring GS, within ten business days,
to show “Private Security” or “Security Patrol” signage on its vehicles that is
visible 50 feet away.  AR 197.  The ISO also proscribed sirens on vehicles, proscribed
GS employees from carrying shotguns or rifles on their person or in their car
while on duty and required all GS guards and Wagneseller to wear uniforms with
BSIS-approved patches on both shoulders identifying that they work for GS.  AR 198.
On June 22, and
again on June 27, 2023, Investigator Diehl visited a parking lot where GS parks
its vehicles.  AR 198.  On both occasions, he found several GS
vehicles that did not display “Private Security” or “Security Patrol” signage
as required by the ISO.  AR 198.
Readyoff testified
to GS vehicles bearing “Ranger Patrol” signage. 
He also stopped a GS vehicle driven by Wagenseller because it had a “ranger”
sign, and Wagenseller had a long gun with an expired permit.  AR 199.
Wagenseller and
Diedtrich both testified.  AR 199.  Wagenseller stated that GS corrected the
signage on some, but not all, vehicles after issuance of the ISO.  AR 200. 
The photos of Diedrich and other GS personnel without badges on their
shoulders and making arrests or issuing citations were largely staged and did
not involve actual public interaction. 
AR 200.  As for patrolling outside
their clients’ properties, both maintained that GS works beyond their clients’
physical locales to any place or circumstance the client needs protection.  AR 200. 
Wagenseller added that local law enforcement has requested or willingly
accepted GS’ assistance in emergency situations in the past.  AR 200.
Pub. Res. Code section
40222 provides that only peace officers may use the title “ranger” and anyone
not a peace officer may not wear or exhibit the title in a way likely to
deceive.  AR 202.  
The first cause
(violation of the ISO by GS and Wagenseller) was established by the
preponderance of evidence as set out in Diehl’s testimony, his photographs, and
Readyhoff’s observations during his traffic stop.  AR 202.
The second cause (giving
the impression of law enforcement against GS, Wagenseller, and Diedrich) was
established.  Pub. Res. Code sections
587.1(b), 7582.26, and 7582.15 act in conjunction to prohibit impersonating law
enforcement.   AR 203.  GS, Wagenseller, and Diedrich wore, or
allowed GS personnel to wear, uniforms without required patches, with the word
“ranger” on them, and in a manner to give the impression they were law
enforcement.  AR 203.  The vehicles also were easily mistaken for
law enforcement vehicles because they were not marked with signage that they
were private patrol and instead had signage of “ranger”.  AR 203. 
Finally, they posted materials on social media depicting GS personnel
engaged in arrests.  AR 203.  Whether these posts were staged does not
affect the misleading impression given. 
AR 203.
The third and fourth
causes (uniform violations armed and unarmed by GS, Wagenseller, and Diedrich)
were essentially the same as the second cause and established for the same
reason.   AR 205.
The fifth and sixth
causes (unlawful carrying of firearms against GS and aiding and abetting
against Wagenseller) were not established. 
AR 208.  
The seventh cause
(unlawful carrying of firearm against Wagenseller) was established by
Readyhoff’s stop of Wagenseller at which the latter had only an expired permit
for his long gun.  AR 208.
The eighth cause (firearms training and instruction violations
against GTS and Wagenseller) was not established.  AR 209.
The ninth cause (acting outside of licensure against GS) was
established by social media posts showing that on one occasion GS responded to
an incident unrelated to its contractual obligations to its client.  AR 211. 
The tenth cause (impersonating law enforcement against GS,
Wagenseller, and Dietrich) is the same charge as the second cause and was established
based on the same findings.  AR 212.
The eleventh cause (operating unauthorized business name
against GS) was established based on GS’s use of the name “Ranger Patrol”.  AR 212.
The ALJ considered
the disciplinary guidelines (AR 212-14) and proposed an order which revoked,
then stayed revocation of, GS’s private Patrol Operator’s License No. 14191,
Dietrich’s Security Guard Registration No. 1935705, and Wagenseller’s Firearm
Permit No. 2634938.  The Proposed
Decision suspended these licenses for 60 days and placed them on probation for
three years on various terms and conditions. 
AR 215-18.  
 
6. BSIS’s Decision
On October 17, 2023,
BSIS issued its final decision adopting the ALJ’s Proposed Decision.  AR000433-99. 
BSIS’s Decision became effective on November 17, 2023.  AR 434.
 
D. Analysis
Petitioners GS, Wagenseller, and Dietrich[4] seek
an order directing BSIS to set aside its order revoking certain of their
licenses and permits, staying the revocation and imposing a 60-day suspension,
and placing them on three years of probation.[5] 
 
1. Young’s Declaration and Powerpoint
Petitioners argue that the primary evidence against them was presented by
Investigator Diehl, who presented a Power Point presentation of photographs
which retired ranger Young had compiled. 
Young did not testify, yet his declaration was read into evidence without
Petitioners having any opportunity to cross examine him.  Neither Young nor Edmiston witnessed any of
the alleged violations, but drew conclusions from the staged social medial
posts online.  Pet. Op. Br. at 2-3.
These strange and foundationless PowerPoint images were merely social
media posts depicting purported violations of law which were completely
unreliable and taken out of context because they were only marketing imagery
and materials.  AR 625-68.  The admission of this hearsay evidence was
improper and greatly prejudiced Petitioners in their ability to defend against
the underlying SAA as they had no opportunity to cross examine Young.   Pet. Op. Br. at 3-4.
Petitioners point to ALJ Furman’s ruling on the ISO petition in which she
stated that there were serious evidentiary problems with Investigator Diehl’s
supporting declaration.  The declaration
failed in many instances to explain the basis for his statements, relied on
unauthenticated and undated photographs annotated with commentary by an
unidentified author used in an undated presentation to an unknown audience.
Other undated photographs appear staged for marketing purposes. The screenshot
of Gate Security’s social media posts do not always indicate when the events
depicted occurred. declaration.  AR 802-03.
ALJ Forman further noted the unreliability of Diehl’s declaration: “SI
Deihl often exaggerates the extent of respondents’ alleged misconduct and thus
many of his statements are speculative. For instance, he states that many of
Gates Security’s’ vehicles are unlawfully equipped with siren systems…;
however, the evidence demonstrates only one Gates Security vehicle contains a
siren system, i.e., the one driven by respondent Wagenseller. Another
photograph purportedly showing a siren system is unauthenticated, truncated,
appears not to be taken by SI Diehl, and has no context to judge its
reliability.” AR 803.
ALJ Forman also was concerned about Diehl’s reliance on hearsay
statements in his declaration: 









///





 “SI Diehl further relies on
statements made by an anonymous former employee of Gates security to support
his assertions. []SI Diehl’s descriptions of those statements are accorded no
weight. There is no way to assess the credibility or reliability of an unknown
witness, thus ‘it is not the kind of evidence upon which responsible persons
are accustomed to rely on in the conduct of serious affairs.’” (Gov. Code,
§11513, subd.(c)).  AR 803.
Petitioners conclude that, if Young’s observations of their unlawful
conduct were so important, BSIS should have had him testify instead of having Diehl
relate Young’s observations secondhand via the Power Point presentation.  Allowing this unreliable hearsay evidence was
a clear abuse of discretion.  Pet. Op.
Br. at 6.
Young’s
declaration and PowerPoint are hearsay. 
The Administrative Procedures Act, which governs the underlying
proceeding, provides:
 
“Hearsay
evidence may be used for the purpose of supplementing or explaining other evidence
but over timely objection shall not be sufficient in itself to support a
finding unless it would be admissible over objection in civil actions.  An objection is timely if made before
submission of the case or on reconsideration.” 
Govt. Code §11513(d). 
 
Pursuant to
Govt. Code section 11513(d), Young’s declaration and PowerPoint could have been
used at least to supplement or explain the other evidence presented by Diehl
and Readyhoff.  But the evidence was not so limited because Wagenseller
and Diedrich made no objection to it.  AR 1367. 
In fact, they affirmatively confirmed their non-objection to the
declaration and PowerPoint.  AR
1367.  Hearsay evidence becomes competent
evidence and may support a factual finding when there is no objection to its
admission at an administrative hearing.  Clary
v. City of Crescent City, (2017) 11 Cal.App.5th 274, 302.  Thus, Young’s declaration and PowerPoint was
properly admitted and could be considered for any evidentiary purpose.[6]  
In reply,
Petitioners argue that Diehl is an unsworn special investigator whose report
would not be admissible under the public employee record exception to hearsay discussed
in Lake v. Reed, (1997) 16 Cal.4th 448.  According to Petitioners, there was a clear
objection to the introduction of Diehl’s hearsay testimony (regarding the PowerPoint)
pursuant to Lake v. Reed when Mr. Dietrich made this objection clearly
and directly on the record.  AR 1392.  In fact, after the ALJ explained her
understanding of Lake v. Reed and how it pertains to “…a police officer”
(AR 1391-92), she stated: “So with that constraint, is there an
objection?”  AR 1392.  Dietrich responded: “Yes, Your Honor, I have
an objection.”  AR 1392.  After Dietrich confirmed that Diehl is not a
sworn law enforcement officer (AR 1392), he objected.  AR 1393.
Petitioners are looking at the wrong exhibit.  Both Wagenseller and Dietrich confirmed they had no objection to Exhibit
9, which was Young’s declaration and PowerPoint presentation.  AR 1367. 
As a result, both were received in evidence.  AR 1367. 
Neither Wagenseller nor Dietrich objected at any point while other
witnesses discussed the declaration and PowerPoint presentation in their
testimony.  See AR 1368-90.  In contrast, Dietrich objected to Exhibit 5,
which was Diehl’s investigative report. 
AR 1391, 1393.  The ALJ received
the exhibit subject to the administrative hearsay rule.  AR 1394. 
One exhibit has nothing to do with the other.
 
          2. The Facts that
No Member of the Public Complained or Testified
Petitioners argue that the Complainant presented no witnesses to Petitioners’
supposedly harmful conduct.  The only witnesses who testified
were Diehl and Readyhoff, a senior ranger with the California Department of
Parks and Recreation who testified to minor violations of signage issues on
their security patrol cars and some alleged firearm issues.  No
member of the public complained of misconduct by Petitioners. No member
of the public testified that they were confused by GS’s security services and
activities.  No current or former clients
of Gates testified, and not even one agent or enforcement analyst from BSIS
testified at the hearing.  This lack of
any reliable, live witnesses clearly showed that the Complainant did not meet
its burden of proof at hearing.  Pet. Op.
Br. at 6.
Aside from the fact that Readyhoff testified to misconduct and not
just minor issues, BSIS points out that Petitioners
are arguing that members of the public must testify to actual harm.  Protection of the public is the primary
purpose of licensing statutes, and a licensing agency need not wait for actual
harm before disciplining a license.  Griffiths v.
Superior Court, (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 757, 773.  Bus. & Prof. Code sections 7587.1(e) and
7582.26(d) prohibit impersonating or
aiding or abetting an employee to impersonate a law enforcement officer or
employee.  Neither section requires actual confusion by a
member of the public. The observations and opinions of ranger Young, Diehl, ranger Readyhoff, and
Edminston were more than sufficient to establish that Petitioners engaged in
conduct that violated statutory and regulatory authority governing their
licensed activity.  See Opp. at 16-17.
In reply, Petitioners admit that actual harm to the public is not a
required element of license discipline actions. 
However, general equitable principles and reasonableness to an
unrepresented party would suggest that lack of any actual public harm or
confusion by Petitioners’ activities) should be considered and acknowledged by BSIS.  It was not, and though this issue is not
dispositive, it is representative of the unfair treatment of Petitioners, who
proceeded in pro per.  Omitting
such important evidence of lack of actual public harm is punitive and serves no
public protection function.   Reply at
8-9.
This is a non-issue.  
Dietrich and Wagenseller were quite capable of stating “we didn’t harm
anyone”.   Nor is there a different rule for pro pers
than other parties.  “Except when a
particular rule provides otherwise, the rules of civil procedure must apply
equally to parties represented by counsel and those who forgo attorney
representation”.  Rappleyea v.
Campbell, (11994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 984-85.  “A doctrine generally requiring or permitting
exceptional treatment of parties who represent themselves would lead to a
quagmire in the trial courts, and would be unfair to the other parties to
litigation.”  Id. at 985.  So long as Dietrich and Wagenseller
understood the administrative process that was happening – and there is no
evidence they did not -- that was sufficient. 

 
3. Wagenseller’s
Firearms Instructor License
Petitioners argue that, in a very concerning and
contradictory move, the ALJ’s Proposed decision revoked Wagenseller’s Firearm
Permit Number 2364938, imposed a 60-day suspension, and thereafter placed it on
probation for three years.  AR 181.  This decision was an abuse of discretion in
that the ALJ found that “[t]here was insufficient legal bases or insufficient
evidence to establish three causes of discipline, all related to misuse of
firearms.”  AR 156-57.  It was improper and inconsistent for the ALJ
to suspend Wagenseller’s Firearms Instructor License for 60 days when she
concurrently held that the Complainant failed to establish that any violations
concerning the misuse of firearms existed.  AR 157. 
Pet. Op. Br. at 7-8.
Petitioners are simply wrong.  The ALJ did not suspend Wagenseller’s Firearm
Instructor’s License, she suspended his Firearm Permit Number 2364938.   The ALJ found insufficient evidence on the
eighth cause (firearms training and instruction violations against GTS and
Wagenseller) and no action was taken on Wagenseller’s Firearms Instructor License.  AR 209.  
Therefore, Petitioners’ discussion of the ALJ’s findings on the weakness
of this evidence is irrelevant.  AR
172-74.  Pet. Op. Br. at 7-8.
The ALJ did find that the seventh cause (unlawful carrying of firearm against Wagenseller) was
established by Readyhoff’s stop of Wagenseller at which the latter had only an
expired permit for his long gun.  AR 208.  As a result, she revoked, suspended, and
placed his Firearm Permit on probation.  AR
180.
In reply, Petitioners admit their error in arguing that BSIS improperly
disciplined Wagenseller’s Firearms Instructor License.  Now, they contend that it was error to
discipline his firearms permit.  The ALJ
concluded that Wagenseller produced an expired firearm permit when stopped by ranger
Readyhoff.  AR 208.  This is inaccurate, as a recent review of
Wagenseller’s firearms permit status on the BSIS license lookup website does
not indicate the license was expired. 
There may have been some confusion on Wagenseller’s part during
testimony on this issue, but BSIS’s own records do not clearly indicate his
firearms permit has ever expired.  Reply
at 9-10.
This argument
suffers from two fatal defects.  First,
it raises a new issue for the first time in reply that is waived.  New
evidence/issues raised for the first time in a reply brief are not properly
presented to a trial court and may be disregarded.  Regency Outdoor Advertising v. Carolina
Lances, Inc., (“Regency”) (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1323, 1333.  Second, it relies on a “review of
Wagenseller’s firearms permit status” that is not in the Administrative Record
and not supported by any evidence.
 
4. Non-Compliance
with the ISO
The ISO ordered
Petitioners to take the following actions: (1) within ten business days, apply
“private security” or “security patrol” signage to its “ranger Patrol” vehicles
in lettering visible from 50 feet away; (2) remove all siren systems in GS’s
vehicles; (3) Wagenseller and Dietrich, and all employees of GS, are prohibited
from openly carrying a shotgun or rifle on their person or in their vehicle
while on duty; and (4) Wagenseller and all of GS’s security guards shall wear
uniforms with BSIS-approved patches on both shoulders identifying them as
employees of GS.  AR 818.  The ISO specified that Petitioners’ failure
to comply with the terms of the ISO would constitute a separate cause for
disciplinary action against GS and Diedrich. 
AR 819.
The ALJ found that
the first cause (violation of the ISO by GS and Wagenseller) was established by
the preponderance of evidence as set out in Diehl’s testimony, his photographs,
and Readyhoff’s observations during his traffic stop.  AR 202.
Petitioners argue that the SAA first cause alleged that GS vehicles
did not display the “Private Security” or “Security Patrol” signage as required
by the ISO.  AR 164.  Other allegations were that GS’s cars bore
the signage “ranger Patrol” on “several occasions.” AR 165.  Pet. Op. Br. at 10.
Petitioners produced evidence that Gates corrected some, but
not all, patrol vehicles’ signage.  AR
166.  They also produced evidence that
the cars without corrected signage were used “…exclusively for marketing events
such as parades.”  AR 166.  Pet. Op. Br. at 10.
Both Wagenseller and Dietrich testified that the images on
social media depicting GS personnel in uniforms without badges on the shoulders
and left breast areas performing arrests and writing citations were staged and only
used for marketing purposes showing hypothetical security firm situations and
encounters without actual public interaction.  AR 166. 
Pet. Op. Br. at 10.
Dietrich and Wagenseller also testified that GS’s work went
beyond its clients’ property lines at times and involved any place the client
might need protection, a reasonable function of any reputable security firm.  AR 166. 
Petitioners offered evidence that that local law enforcement agencies
“…have requested or willingly accepted Gates Security personnel’s assistance
when dealing with emergency situations throughout the areas Gates Security
operates.”  AR 166, 976-80.  They presented letters of support from fire
and police departments praising GS’s willingness to help them in times of need.
 AR 166-67.  Clearly, public protection and local law
enforcement agencies are benefitted by GS’s assistive activities.  Given the abundant evidence Petitioners
produced at hearing, there should have been no finding that the ISO was
violated in any way.  Pet. Op. Br. at 10.
BSIS argues that Petitioners fail to provide
an adequate statement of facts with citations to the record.  Opp. at 14-15.
BSIS is correct.  When a petitioner challenges an
administrative decision as unsupported by substantial evidence in light of the
record as a whole, it is the petitioner’s burden to demonstrate that the
administrative record does not contain sufficient evidence to support the
agency’s decision.  State Water
Resources Control Board Cases, (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 674, 749.  A recitation of only the part of the evidence
that supports the petitioner’s position is not the “demonstration” contemplated
by this rule.  Accordingly, if a
petitioner contends that some issue of fact is not sustained, he is required to
set forth in his brief all the material evidence on the point and note merely
his own evidence.  Unless this is done,
the error is deemed to be waived.  Id.
(quoting Foreman & Clark Corp. v. Fallon, (1971) 3 Cal.3d 875,
881).  Petitioners rely on their own
evidence without identifying the Complainant’s evidence supporting a violation
of the ISO.  Consequently, they have
failed to meet their burden of showing that the ALJ’s Proposed Decision is not
supported by the weight of the evidence.[7] 
In any event, the
weight of the evidence does support a violation of the ISO.  The ISO was issued on May 5, 2023.  AR 818-20.  Diehl conducted two field visits, on June 22
and June 27, 2023, to verify Petitioners’ ISO compliance.  AR 822-23, 828, 831-32, 834, 836, 838, 1442-45,
1447-49.  While some “private security”
signage was placed on the top of the rear bumper on some vehicles, the signage
was not visible from 50 feet away because of where the signage was applied.  AR 834, 838. 

Ranger Readyhoff
conducted a traffic stop on one of GS’s vehicles on May 13, 2022 because it had
the word “ranger” on it.  AR 1510-12.  Wagenseller was driving the vehicle.  AR 1513. 
Readyhoff observed that the vehicle’s requisite signage identifying it
as private patrol was too small to be seen from 50 feet away.  AR 1512-15. 
Readyhoff stated that he would have confused GS’s ranger Patrol vehicles
for law enforcement vehicles if he did not have prior experience with their
vehicles. AR 1512, 1522-23.
The ALJ correctly found that “Wagenseller’s contention that
any Gates Security vehicles out of compliance with the ISO were only used for
parages and other purposes not directly related to servicing clients is not a
valid defense.  The ISO clearly required
Gates Security to correct the signage on all its vehicles.”   AR 202-03. 
Petitioners’ argument that they should not be subject to
discipline for violating the ISO based on
staged social media posts was rebutted by the ALJ: “Social media postings are a
form of marketing or branding and thus serve a business purpose and are
executed in the course of doing business.” 
AR 204.  If Petitioners never meant to mislead the
public into believing it had some connection to the real ranger service, it
should have never used the term “ranger” anywhere in its marketing.
In reply, Petitioners argue that ranger Readyhoff stopped a GS vehicle on
May 13, 2023, and the stop was clearly within the ten-day compliance period of
the ISO.  Thus, this evidence should not
have been admitted nor relied upon as a violation of the ISO.       Petitioners
add that there was evidence that GS had upgraded its patrol cars and the issue
whether it was visible from 50 feet away as ordered by the ISO is a subjective
matter that could not be conclusively proven at hearing.  AR 834, 838. 
Pet. Op. Br. at 10.  The former
may be true, but again Petitioners raise new issues for the first time in reply
that are waived.  Regency, supra,
31 Cal.App.4th at 1333.
Finally, Petitioners reply that there was no evidence that they had any
intention to mislead the public in the social media posts and there was ample
evidence of their lack of desire to do so.  Examples of compliant conduct included their
efforts to change “ranger” markings on their cars and their completion of these
efforts, all pursuant to the ISO.  AR 834,
838.  Reply at 11.  
The ALJ never stated that Petitioners made no effort to comply with the
ISO.  She only ruled that they violated
it.  The ALJ stated: “While they made
some changes, including removing sirens from their patrol vehicles, the number
of Gates Security vehicles left with improper markings and without clear signage
that they are private patrol demonstrates some ongoing resistance to operating
Gates Security within the bounds of the law.” 
AR 214.  This ruling is supported
by the evidence.
 
E. Conclusion
The Petition is denied.  BSIS’s counsel is ordered to prepare a
proposed judgment, serve it on Petitioners’ counsel for approval as to form,
wait ten days after service for any objections, meet and confer if there are
objections, and then submit the proposed judgment along with a declaration
stating the existence/non-existence of any unresolved objections.  An OSC re: judgment is set for September 19,
2024 at 9:30 a.m.
