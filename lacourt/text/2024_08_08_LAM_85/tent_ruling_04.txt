The City relies on the fact that Moore’s proofs of service of the Petition,
both signed and attested to by Ronique, state that the Petition was served on
the Board’s clerk on March 21, 2024, and the FAP was served on the Board’s
clerk on April 16, 2024.  These proofs of
service do not mention a demand for reinstatement.  Reply at 4. 
But there is no reason they should. 
Service of process for court purposes differs from service under City
Charter section 1017.

Although it is similarly situated to the Demand for Reinstatement, the court
need not address the Claim for Compensation as failure to file it is only a condition precedent to any recovery of
wages or salary claimed to be due on account of Moore’s discharge.  City Charter §1017.  The failure to timely file it with the City
Clerk would not affect Moore’s right to be restored to his job.
