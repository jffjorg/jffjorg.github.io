Plaintiff American Credit Acceptance, LLC (“ACA”) seeks a
writ of possession and turnover order against Defendant Michael Anthony Yates (“Yates)
to recover a 2019 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Crew Cab with VIN 3GCPYFED8KG189856
(“Vehicle”).
The court has read and considered the moving papers (no
opposition was filed) and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
A. Statement of
the Case
1. Complaint 
On April 23, 2023, Plaintiff ACA filed the Complaint against
Defendant Yates for (1) breach of contract, (2) claim & delivery of
personal property, and (3) declaratory relief. 
The Complaint alleges in pertinent part as follows. 
Prior to this lawsuit, Carmax Auto Superstores California,
Inc. (“Seller”) entered into a written contract (“Contract”) with Yates for the
purchase of the Vehicle.  Compl.,
¶¶9-10.  On or about April 29, 2022, ACA
purchased the Contract.  Compl.,
¶13.  Yates financed the Vehicle for
$44,290.67, with payments of $1,299.83 due on the 13th day of each
month commencing on June 13, 2022. 
Compl., ¶14.  The last payment or
credit was posted on January 3, 2023. 
Compl., ¶14.  Yates has since
defaulted on the U/A Contract.  Compl.,
¶14.
ACA made a demand for Yates to surrender the Vehicle and he
has failed to do so.  Compl., ¶17.  The principal balance due on the Vehicle is
$44,290.67 with a current payoff amount of $49,491.91.  Compl., ¶18.

2. Course of Proceedings 
On June 6, 2024, Plaintiff ACA filed proof of service of the
Complaint and Summons on Defendant Yates by substitute service through
Josephine Yates, adult member of household. 
 
B. Applicable Law
A writ of possession is issued as a provisional remedy in a
cause of action for claim and delivery, also known as replevin.  See
Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro v. Schectman, (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1279,
1288.  As a provisional remedy, the right
to possession is only temporary, and title and the right to possess are
determined in the final judgment.  
            A
writ of possession is available in any pending action.  It also is available where an action has been
stayed pending arbitration, so long as the arbitration award may be ineffectual
without provisional relief.  See CCP §1281.7. 
 
            1. Procedure
            Upon
the filing of the complaint or at any time thereafter, a plaintiff may apply
for an order for a writ of possession. 
Unlike attachment, where Judicial Council forms are optional, the
parties must use the mandatory approved Judicial Council forms in a claim and
delivery proceeding.  (Judicial Council
Forms CD-100 et seq.).
            A
plaintiff must make a written application for a writ of possession.  CCP §512.010(a), (b); (Mandatory Form
CD-100); CCP §512.010(a).  A verified
complaint alone is insufficient.  6
Witkin, California Procedure, (5th ed. 2008) §255, p.203.  The application may be supported by
declarations and/or a verified complaint. 
CCP §516.030.  The declarations or
complaint must set forth admissible evidence except where expressly permitted
to be shown on information and belief.  Id.
            The
application must be executed under oath and include: (1) A showing of the basis
of the plaintiff's claim and that the plaintiff is entitled to possession of
the property claimed.  If the plaintiff's
claim is based on a written instrument, a copy of it must be attached; (2) A
showing that the property is wrongfully detained by the defendant, how the
defendant came into possession of it, and, the reasons for the detention based
on the plaintiff’s best knowledge, information, and belief; (3) A specific description
of the property and statement of its value; (4) The location of the property
according to the plaintiff’s best knowledge, information, and belief.  If the property, or some part of it, is
within a private place which may have to be entered to take possession, a
showing of probable cause to believe that the property is located there; and
(5) A statement that the property has not been taken for (a) a tax, assessment,
or fine, pursuant to a statute, or (b) an execution against the plaintiff’s
property.  Alternatively, a statement
that if the property was seized for one of these purposes, it is by statute
exempt from such seizure.  CCP
§512.010(b).
 
            2. The Hearing
            Before
noticing a hearing, the plaintiff must serve the defendant with all of the
following: (1) A copy of the summons and complaint; (2) A Notice of Application
and Hearing; and (3) A copy of the application and any supporting
declaration.  CCP §512.030(a).  If the defendant has not appeared in the
action, service must be made in the same manner as service of summons and
complaint.  CCP §512.030(b).
            Each
party shall file with the court and serve upon the other party any declarations
and points and authorities intended to be relied upon at the hearing.  CCP §512.050. 
At the hearing, the court decides the merits of the application based on
the pleadings and declarations.   Id.  Upon a showing of good cause, the court may
receive and consider additional evidence and authority presented at the
hearing, or may continue the hearing for the production of such additional
evidence, oral or documentary, or the filing of other affidavits or points and
authorities.  Id.  
            The
court may order issuance of a writ of possession if both of the following are
found: (1) The plaintiff has established the probable validity of the
plaintiff’s claim to possession of the property; and (2) The undertaking
requirements of CCP section 515.010 are satisfied.  CCP §512.060(a).  “A claim has ‘probable validity’ where it is
more likely than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the
defendant on that claim.”  CCP
§511.090.  This requires that the
plaintiff establish a prima facie case; the writ shall not issue if the
defendant shows a reasonable probability of a successful defense to the claim
and delivery cause of action.  Witkin,
California Procedure, (5th ed. 2008) §261, p.208.  A defendant’s claim of defect in the property
is not a defense to the plaintiff’s right to possess it.  RCA Service Co. v. Superior Court,
(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 1, 3.
            No
writ directing the levying officer to enter a private place to take possession
of any property may be issued unless the plaintiff has established that there
is probable cause to believe that the property is located there.  CCP §512.060(b).  
            The
successful plaintiff may obtain a preliminary injunction containing the same
provisions as a TRO that remains in effect until the property is seized by the
levying officer.[1]  CCP §513.010(c).  
            The
court may also issue a “turnover order” directing the defendant to transfer
possession of the property to the plaintiff (See Mandatory Form CD-120). 
The order must notify the defendant that failure to comply may subject
him or her to contempt of court.  CCP
§512.070.  The turnover remedy is not
issued in lieu of a writ, but in conjunction with it to provide the plaintiff
with a less expensive means of obtaining possession.  See
Edwards v Superior Court, (“Edwards”) (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 173,
178.
 
            3. The Plaintiff’s Undertaking
            Generally,
the court cannot issue an order for a writ of possession until the plaintiff
has filed an undertaking with the court (Mandatory Form CD-140 for personal
sureties).  CCP §515.010(a).  The undertaking shall provide that the
sureties are bound to the defendant for the return of the property to the
defendant, if return of the property is ordered, and for the payment to the
defendant of any sum recovered against the plaintiff.  Id. 
The undertaking shall be in an amount not less than twice the value of
the defendant's interest in the property or in a greater amount.  Id. 
The value of the defendant's interest in the property is determined by
the market value of the property less the amount due and owing on any
conditional sales contract or security agreement and all liens and encumbrances
on the property, and any other factors necessary to determine the defendant’s
interest in the property.  Id.
            However,
where the defendant has no interest in the property, the court must waive the requirement
of the plaintiff’s undertaking and include in the order for issuance of the
writ the amount of the defendant’s undertaking sufficient to satisfy the
requirements of CCP section 515.020(b).  CCP
§515.010(b). 
 
C. Statement of Facts
Plaintiff ACA owns the Vehicle pursuant to a purchase and
assignment of the Contract in which Defendant Yates purchased the Vehicle.  Palma Decl., ¶4, Exs. 1-2.  Pursuant to the Contract, ACA has right to
immediate possession of the Vehicle upon default of any provision thereof.  Palma Decl., ¶¶4-5, 9, 14.
Yates is in default under the Contract by failing to make
the payment due and owing after January 3, 2023, in the sum of $1,299.83 on the
13th day of each month.  Palma
Decl., ¶¶6-7, 9.  Yates is in default for
$44,290.67 in principal, plus interest, for a total amount of $49,491.9.  Palma Decl., ¶¶8-10, Ex. 3.  ACA has made a demand upon Yates for payment
or turnover of the Vehicle, but Yates has failed to surrender or pay for the
Vehicle.  Palma Decl., ¶9.
The J.D. Power report for January 18, 2024 states the Vehicle’s
average wholesale and retail values are between $32,275 and $32,532.  Palma Decl., ¶12, Ex. 4.  The outstanding balance on the Contract
exceeds the market value for the Vehicle, so Yates has no equity in the Vehicle.  Palma Decl., ¶12.
There is no indication that the Vehicle has been taken on
account of a tax, assessment or fine, or seizure under an execution or an
attachment against the property of ACA.  Palma
Decl., ¶13.
 ACA’s current records
reflects that Yates’ place of residence is 4825 N Bonnie Cove Ave, Covina, CA
91724.  Palma Decl. Re: Location, ¶4.  This is the current location of the
Vehicle.  Palma Decl., ¶15.
 
D. Analysis

a writ of possession against, and turnover order for the Vehicle from, Defendant
Yates.  No opposition is on file.

undertaking required by CCP section 515.010(a) is an amount not less than twice
the value of the defendant's interest in the property or in a greater
amount.  Id.  The value of the defendant's interest in the
property is determined by the market value of the property less the amount due
and owing on any conditional sales contract or security agreement and all liens
and encumbrances on the property.  Id.  
The J.D. Power report for January 18, 2024 states the

E. Conclusion
The application for writ of possession and turnover order is
granted.  ACA is not required to file an undertaking
and the re-delivery bond will be $32,532. 
No order for writ of possession is on file and ACA is ordered to file it
in the next two court days or it will be waived.
