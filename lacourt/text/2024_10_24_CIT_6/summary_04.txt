And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Raquel Armenta, a person with a disability, who is seeking approval of a compromise of her claim against Luis Toledo. The judge notes that the petition does not contain a full disclosure of all information that has any bearing on the reasonableness of the settlement amount and that it is unclear how $50,000 is sufficient for Claimant's injuries and care.

The judge requires the petitioner to provide the requisite 15 days' notice by mail to the three state agencies and to submit a corrected proposed order addressing the defects noted in the ruling. The petitioner is also ordered to provide notice of the court's ruling and file proof of service of same within five days of the court's order.

The judge also notes that the proposed Special Needs Trust may not be the best option for Claimant, given the small amount of net proceeds at stake, and that a bond may be required for the trustee. Finally, the judge orders the petitioner to file a completed proposed order with the required findings and to address the issues of trust supervision and bond requirement.

The hearing will be continued to allow the petitioner to correct the deficiencies in the petition and to address the issues raised by the judge.
