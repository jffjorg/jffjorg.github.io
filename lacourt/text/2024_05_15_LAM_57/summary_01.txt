And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses several motions filed by the defendants. The court previously granted the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the Thirteenth Affirmative Defense, which posits that the defendants owed no duty to defend the insured under the insurance policy. The court ruled that this defense fails as a matter of law because the policy does not clearly and unambiguously exclude the duty to defend.

The court also considered the defendants' motion to compel plaintiffs to produce documents at the deposition of Peter Voutsas and found that the plaintiffs have complied with the court's order to produce the documents. Therefore, the court is taking the motion off calendar.

The court denied the defendants' ex parte application to continue the trial date, which was based on the supposition that the plaintiffs had not complied with the court's order to produce documents. However, the court found that the plaintiffs have complied with the order.

The court also denied the defendants' ex parte application to shorten time on hearing on motion to compel deposition of Peter Marco, LLC. Instead, the court ordered the parties to meet and confer to select a date for the deposition of Peter Voutsas, which will also serve as the deposition of Peter Marco, LLC. The court also ordered that the deposition of Peter Marco, LLC will go forward, but Peter Marco, LLC is not required to respond to requests for production of documents that Voutsas has already responded to.
