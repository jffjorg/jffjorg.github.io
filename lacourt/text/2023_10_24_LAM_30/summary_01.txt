Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to compel arbitration filed by Uponor, Inc. The motion sought to compel Cross-Complainant Kennco Plumbing, Inc. to arbitrate its claims against Uponor based on an arbitration provision in the "UPONOR, INC. LIMITED WARRANTY". The limited warranty provides for arbitration of disputes between building owners and homeowners, but the judge has determined that Kennco's allegations fail to identify the warranty underlying its claims against Uponor, and thus the court cannot determine that those claims fall within the scope of the limited warranty and its arbitration provision. Additionally, the judge has found that Kennco has not pled any term of the warranty allegedly breached by Uponor, and that Uponor has presented no evidence of Kennco's agreement to the limited warranty.
