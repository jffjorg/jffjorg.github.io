And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted with 10 days' leave to amend. The plaintiffs, Ana Cornejo and Pedro Betancourt, brought a lemon-law action against the defendant, American Honda Motor Co., Inc., alleging breach of implied warranty and breach of express warranty under the Song-Beverly Act. The defendant argued that the plaintiffs lack standing under the Act and that the certified pre-owned warranty does not constitute a "new warranty" under the Act.

The judge has agreed with the defendant that the plaintiffs' claims are precluded by the Court of Appeal's decision in Rodriguez v. FCA US, which held that a used car purchased from a retail seller unaffiliated with the manufacturer does not qualify as a "new motor vehicle" under the Song-Beverly Act. The judge has also found that the plaintiffs' breach of implied warranty claim fails because the defendant did not act as the distributor or retailer of the vehicle and the complaint does not allege that the defendant issued a new warranty along with the sale of the vehicle.

The judge has given the plaintiffs 10 days to amend their complaint to address these issues, but has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted.
