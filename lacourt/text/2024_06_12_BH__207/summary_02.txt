Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a dispute over unpaid legal fees for services rendered to and at the behest of Mark Jarmus, who is now deceased. The plaintiff, RMO LLP, alleges that it provided legal representation to Mark Jarmus as Trustee of the Leslie Jarmus Family Trust and that it is owed unpaid legal fees. The defendant, Alex Borden, Personal Representative of the Estate of Mark Jarmus, demurs to the complaint on several grounds, including that the court lacks jurisdiction and that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.

The judge has determined that the defendant did not adequately meet and confer with the plaintiff before filing the demurrer, and therefore, the court is continuing the hearing on the demurrer to August 6, 2024, to allow the parties to properly meet and confer and amend the pleadings, if necessary. The judge has also ordered the defendant to provide notice of the court's orders and file the notice with proof of service forthwith.
