And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has ruled in favor of the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories and requests for production. The court found that the defendant's objections to the motions were unsubstantiated and failed to provide sufficient evidence to support their claims. The court also found that the defendant's responses to the special interrogatories and requests for production were incomplete and failed to comply with the applicable rules of court. The court ordered the defendant to serve further verified, code-compliant responses and to produce responsive documents within 30 days of notice of the court's order.
