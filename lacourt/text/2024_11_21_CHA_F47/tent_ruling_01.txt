SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of a motor vehicle v. bicycle
collision that occurred on 10/22/21 in Santa Clarita.  Plaintiff Siegfred Conson (Plaintiff) alleges
that while making a right turn, Defendant Robert Moynihan (Defendant) struck
Plaintiff while Plaintiff was riding his bicycle within the cross-walk on a
green light.
 
On 3/8/23, Plaintiff filed this action against Defendant
and Patricia Moynihan for negligence.  On
4/14/23, Defendant and Patricia Moynihan answered the complaint.
 
On 8/15/24, Plaintiff electronically served his Request
for Admissions, Set 1, on Defendant.  (Herron
Decl., Ex.1).  No responses were
received; therefore, on 9/19/24, Plaintiff’s counsel’s office sent a meet and
confer email to Defendant’s counsel requesting complete, verified responses,
without objection, within 7 days.  (Gordon
Decl., Ex.1).  No response to the meet
and confer letter was received and Defendant failed to serve responses to the
Requests for Admissions.  (Gordon Decl.;
Herron Decl.).  
 
On 10/1/24, Plaintiff filed and electronically served the
instant motion seeking an order deeming Plaintiff’s Requests for Admissions,
Set 1, served on Defendant Robert Moynihan on 8/15/24 admitted.  Additionally, Plaintiff requests sanctions
against Defendant and/or his counsel, Collison, Daehnke, Inlow & Greco, in
the amount of $1,500.00.  Defendant has
opposed the motion and Plaintiff has filed a reply to the opposition.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
CCP 2033.280 provides: 
 
“If a party to whom requests for
admission are directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules
apply:
(a) The party to whom the requests
for admission are directed waives any objection to the requests, including one
based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section
2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on
its determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied:
(1) The party has subsequently
served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections
2033.210, 2033.220,
and 2033.230.
(2) The party's failure to serve a
timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.
(b) The requesting party may move
for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters
specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010).
(c) The court shall make this
order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have
been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response
to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. It is mandatory that the court
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”
 
Defendant admits that the responses to the Requests for
Admissions were not timely served and claims that the failure to do so was the
result of mistake, inadvertence and/or excusable neglect.  (See Lloyd Decl.).  It then appears that Defendant is attempting
to obtain relief from the waiver of objections due to the failure to timely
serve responses.  However, Defendant then
claims the responses without objections have been served.  (See Opposition, p.2:11-p.3:2).  As such, Defendant contends the motion is moot
because responses in compliance with CCP 2033.220(b) have been served before
the hearing.  See CCP
2033.280(c).  Based on the fact that the
failure to served timely responses was the result of counsel’s mistake,
Defendant’s counsel asks that the Court “void any sanction award” or “to award
deminimus sanctions.”  (See
Opposition, p.3:16-17).
 
The reply argues that the First Amended Responses to the
Requests for Admissions still improperly include objections.  As such, Plaintiff contends that he is “entitled
to complete and verified RFA responses, that only admit and contain no
objections, along with sanctions in the amount of $1,568.91” (increased from
$1,500.00 requested in the motion to include the filing fee).  (See Reply, p.4:11-14).    
 
To the extent Defendant is seeking relief from the waiver
of objections due to the failure to serve timely responses, such relief is
denied.  Defendant has failed to properly
request such relief by way of a motion as required under CCP 2033.280(a).  Even if requesting such relief in the
opposition to a motion to deem matters admitted was appropriate, Defendant has
failed to establish that the responses served are in substantial compliance
with CCP 2033.210, 2033.220 and 2033.230.
 
The Court finds that the arguments raised in the reply
regarding the deficiencies in the First Amended Responses to the Requests for
Admissions would be more properly addressed in a motion to compel further
responses which would allow Defendant the opportunity to respond to such
arguments.  To avoid any prejudice to
Plaintiff based on the 45 day deadline for such a motion as set forth in CCP
2033.290(c), the Court orders that Plaintiff has 45 days from the date of the
ruling on this motion to bring such a motion after meeting and conferring with Defendant’s
counsel regarding the First Amended Responses. 
 
 
The Court finds that sanctions against Defendant and his
counsel are mandatory because the failure to serve timely responses
necessitated the motion.  CCP
2033.280(c).  The Court finds that the
$1,568.91 requested by Plaintiff to be reasonable.  (See Herron Decls. submitted in
support of the motion and reply).      
 
CONCLUSION
 
The request to deem Plaintiff’s Requests for Admissions,
Set 1, served on Defendant Robert Moynihan admitted is denied.  Plaintiff’s request for sanctions against
Defendant Robert Moynihan and his counsel, Collison, Daehnke, Inlow & Greco,
in the amount of $1,568.91 is granted. 
Sanctions are payable within 30 days. 

 
Plaintiff shall have 45 days from the date of the ruling
on this motion to file and serve a motion to compel further responses regarding
the First Amended Responses to Requests for Admissions, Set 1, served by
Defendant.
 
The Court notes that in violation of CRC 3.1110(f)(4)
Plaintiff has failed to electronically bookmark the exhibits submitted in
support of the moving papers (the exhibits submitted in support of the reply
are electronically bookmarked) and Defendant has failed to electronically
bookmark the exhibits submitted in support of the opposition.  Counsel for the parties are warned that
failure to comply with this rule in the future may result in matters being
continued so that papers can be resubmitted in compliance, papers not being
considered and/or the imposition of sanctions.
