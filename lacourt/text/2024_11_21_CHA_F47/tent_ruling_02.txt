Case #24CHCV00109
 
MOTION TO
COMPEL ARBITRATION
 
Motion filed on 7/12/24.
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Edwin Noguera
NOTICE: ok
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order compelling
Plaintiff Edwin Noguera to arbitrate his claims pursuant to the arbitration
agreement and staying this action pending the outcome of the arbitration.

 
RULING: The motion is granted.  
 
SUMMARY OF ACTION & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiff Edwin Noguera’s (Plaintiff)
lease of a 2023 Mercedes-Benz C43 (the Vehicle) on 6/22/23.  The lease agreement includes an arbitration
provision which provides, in relevant part: 
 
“Important
Arbitration Disclosures”
 
“Any claim or dispute, whether in
contract, tort or otherwise (including any dispute over the interpretation,
scope, or validity of this lease, arbitration section or the arbitrability of
any issue), between you and us or any of our employees, agents , successors,
assigns, or the vehicle distributor, including Mercedes-Benz USA LLC (each a
“Third-Party Beneficiary”), which arises out of or relates to a credit
application, this lease, or any resulting transaction or relationship
arising out of this lease (including any such relationship with third parties
who do not sign this contract) shall, at the election of either you, us, or
a ThirdParty Beneficiary, be resolved by a neutral, binding arbitration and not
by a court action.” (underlining added)
 
(See Remillard Decl., Ex.2,
p.4)
 
The arbitration provision further provides: 
 
“This lease evidences a transaction
involving interstate commerce. Any arbitration under this lease shall be
governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 USC 1, et seq).”
 
Id.
 
On 1/11/24, Plaintiff filed this action against Defendant
Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (Defendant) and LAD-MD, LLC dba Mercedes-Benz of Los
Angeles for: (1) Violation of Song-Beverly Act - Breach of Express Warranty,
(2) Violation of Song-Beverly Act - Breach of Implied Warranty and (3) Negligent
Repair (not alleged against Defendant).  
 
On 7/10/24, Defendant requested that Plaintiff stipulate
to arbitration pursuant to the arbitration provision in the lease agreement for
the Vehicle.  (Remillard Decl., Ex.3).  Plaintiff did not agree to submit the matter
to arbitration.  Id.  Therefore, on 7/12/24, Defendant filed and
served the instant motion seeking an order compelling Plaintiff to arbitrate
his claims pursuant to the arbitration agreement and staying this action
pending the outcome of the arbitration. 
Plaintiff has opposed the motion and Defendant has filed a reply to the
opposition.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
Defendant’s Request for Judicial Notice is granted. 
 
Plaintiff’s objection to the “Appendix” to Defendant’s
reply is sustained.   
 
The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) applies to a written
arbitration agreement in a contract involving commerce.  See 9 U.S.C. §2.  Here, the arbitration provision written in
the lease agreement necessarily involves interstate commerce because even when
used intra-state, “cars are themselves instrumentalities of interstate
commerce.”  See United States
v. Oliver (9th Cir. 1995) 60 F.3d 547, 550; Sanchez  (2015) 61 C4th 899, 906; (Remillard Decl.,
Ex.2).  Additionally, as noted above, the
lease agreement specifically states that “any arbitration under this lease
shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.”  (Remillard Decl., Ex.2, p.4).  As such, the FAA controls.  See Rodriguez (2006) 136 CA4th
1110, 1122.  Under the FAA, an arbitration
agreement is “valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as
exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.”  9 U.S.C. § 2. 
Here, no grounds exist to revoke the arbitration agreement.
 
Under California law, the arbitration agreement is also
valid.  On petition of a party to an
arbitration agreement alleging the existence of a written arbitration agreement
and that a party to the agreement refuses to arbitrate the subject controversy,
the court shall order arbitration if it determines that an agreement to
arbitrate exists.  CCP 1281.2.  Again, a written agreement to arbitrate
exists and Plaintiff has refused Defendant’s request to submit this matter to
arbitration.  (Remillard Decl., Ex.2, 3).  Under California law, the Court must compel
arbitration unless it finds that the right to compel arbitration has been
waived by Defendant or grounds exist for revocation of the agreement.  See Condee (2001) 88 CA4th 215,
219.  Here, there is no evidence that
Defendant has waived its right to arbitration nor is there evidence of any
ground for revocation of the agreement.  
 
As such, Defendant may move to compel arbitration under the
FAA (9 U.S.C. §§1-16) and the California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP 1281, et
seq.).
 
A non-signatory to an arbitration agreement, such as
Defendant, can compel a signatory, such as Plaintiff, to arbitrate as a third-party
beneficiary to the arbitration agreement. 
See Mance (N.D. Cal. 2012) 901 F.Supp.2d 1147, 1155.  While it is not necessary that a third-party
beneficiary be named or identified in the contract, an agreement which
expressly names and requires arbitration of claims against the beneficiary is
sufficient to establish that party’s right to enforce the arbitration provision
against signatories to the contract.  See
Ronay Family Limited Partnership (2013) 216 CA4th 830, 836, 838-839; Ford
Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89 CA5th 1324, 1339  Here, Defendant is specifically named as a
third-party beneficiary in the arbitration provision.  As such, Defendant is clearly an intended
beneficiary of the agreement.  The cases
relied on by Plaintiff are distinguishable from the instant case because in
those cases, the defendant moving to compel arbitration was not expressly named
as a third-party beneficiary.  See
Ochoa (Ford Motor Warranty Cases) (2023) 89 CA5th 1324,
1329-1330; Montemayor (2023) 92 CA5th 958, 962; Davis (2024) 100
CA5th 825, 832; Yeh (2023) 95 CA5th 264, 269; Kielar (2023) 94
CA5th 614; Rivera (2024) 105 CA5th 288, 291.  
 
Plaintiff’s argument that the claims in this action fall
outside the scope of the arbitration provision is without merit.  First, the arbitration agreement contains a
delegation clause which provides that “any dispute over the interpretation,
scope or validity of this lease, arbitration section or the arbitrability of
any issue” is itself subject to arbitration. 
(Remillard Decl., Ex.2, p.4).  As
such, an issue regarding the scope of the arbitration must be resolve by the
arbitrator.  See First Options
of Chicago, Inc. (1995) 514 U.S. 938, 943; Henry Schein, Inc. (2019)
586 U.S. 63, 71.  Even if the scope of
the arbitration was for this Court to determine, the Court finds that Plaintiff’s
claims against Defendant fall within the arbitration provision.  Plaintiff’s claims against Defendant arise
out of and relate to the lease of the Vehicle and the “resulting” warranty
relationship that followed the execution of the lease agreement.  As such, the arbitration  provision applies.  (See Remillard Decl. ¶4, Ex.2, p.4).  All of Plaintiff’s claims against Defendant in
this action arise out of the relationship between Plaintiff as the consumer and
Defendant as the manufacturer/warrantor of the Vehicle.  Plaintiff could not make the claims under the
Song-Beverly Act against Defendant if not for the warrantee/warrantor relationship
which arose out of the lease agreement containing the arbitration provision.  (See Complaint). 
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted. 
This action is stayed pending the outcome of the arbitration.  9 U.S.C. §3; CCP 1281.4.
