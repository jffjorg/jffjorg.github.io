MOVING PARTY: Plaintiffs Pilar Alonso and MPA 123 LLC
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant Besian Shaquiri
NOTICE: ok
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order striking
Defendant Besian Shaquiri’s Answer to the Verified Complaint.  

 
RULING: The motion to strike is denied without

SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of the lease of residence in Santa
Clarita, California by Defendant Besian Shaquiri (Defendant) from Plaintiff MPA
123 LLC (MPA) beginning on or about 3/15/18. 
Plaintiff Pilar Alonso (Alonso), who is currently 81 years old, is alleged
to be the sole owner, member and employee of MPA.
 
Plaintiffs allege that shortly after Defendant moved into
the residence he began to make complaints about the condition of the
residence.  Plaintiffs allege that
Defendant claimed he was a licensed contractor, insisted on making repairs,
which Plaintiffs claims were unnecessary, himself and intimidated Alonso into
allowing him to do so or did not obtain permission to make certain
repairs/alterations.  Plaintiff alleges
that Defendant demanded payment for the repairs and/or rent offsets.  Plaintiff also contends that Defendant
refused to comply with rent increases imposed over the years of his
tenancy.    
 
On 5/29/24, Plaintiffs filed this action against
Defendant for: (1) Business & Professions Code 7031, (2) Fraud/Intentional
Misrepresentation, (3) Negligent Misrepresentation, (4) Breach of Written
Contract, (5) Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, (6) Waste, (7) Civil
Extortion and (8) Financial Elder Abuse. 
On 7/16/24, Defendant filed an Answer to the Complaint which asserts the
following 47 Affirmative Defenses: (1) Failure to State a Claim, (2) Unclean
Hands, (3) Waiver, (4) Equitable Estoppel, (5) Failure to Mitigate, (6) Lack of
Standing, (7) Ratification and Waiver, (8) Third Party Causation, (9) Mutual or
Unilateral Mistake, (10) No Claim for Negligent Misrepresentation, (11)
Speculative Damages, (12) Materiality, (13) Preventative/Corrective
Opportunities, (14) Third Party Conduct, (15) Intervening Acts, 
(16) Allocation of Fault, (17) Accord and  Satisfaction, (18) Performance Excused, (19)
Full or Partial Performance, (20) Economic Loss, (21) Laches, (22) Statute of
Limitations, (23) Avoidable Consequences, (24) Failure to Exhaust Remedies,
(25) Privilege, (26) Assumption of Risk, (27) Doe Defendants, (28) Off-Set,
(29) Sums Already Paid, (30) Res-Judicata/Equitable Estoppel, (31) Damages
Caused by Plaintiff, (32) Contributory/Comparative Fault, (33) Acts or
Omissions of Others, (34) Reasonable Conduct, (35) Unconscionable Contract,
(36) Non-Negotiated Terms and/or Conditions, (37) No Claim for
Fraud/Intentional Misrepresentation, (38) Adhesion, (39) Ripeness, (40)
Impossibility, Impracticality and/or Frustration of Purpose, (41) Inducement,
(42) Lack of Justifiable Controversy, (43) Lawful Conduct, (44) Good Faith,
(45) Reasonable and/or Exigent Circumstances, (46) Failure and/or Lack of
Consideration and (47) Reliance on Advice of Counsel.  
 
After Defendant’s counsel failed to respond to
Plaintiffs’ counsel’s meet and confer efforts regarding the issues Plaintiffs
had with the Answer, on 8/13/24, Plaintiff filed and served a demurrer to each
of the 47 affirmative defenses asserted in Defendant’s Answer to the
complaint.  Defendant did not oppose or
otherwise respond to the demurrer.  On 9/16/24,
this Court sustained the demurrer to the answer with 20 days leave to
amend.  (See 9/16/24 Minute
Order).  Defendant’s counsel appeared at
the 9/16/24 hearing and waived notice.  
 
Defendant failed to file a First Amended Answer within
the 20 days ordered by the Court. 
Therefore, on 10/21/24, Plaintiff filed and served the instant motion
seeking an order striking Defendant’s Answer to the Verified Complaint.  Defendant has opposed the motion and
Plaintiffs have filed a reply to the opposition.    
  
ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiffs make this motion pursuant to CCP 575.2 which
provides: 
 
“(a) Local rules promulgated
pursuant to Section
575.1 may provide that if any counsel, a party represented by counsel,
or a party if in pro se, fails to comply with any of the requirements thereof,
the court on motion of a party or on its own motion may strike out all or any
part of any pleading of that party, or, dismiss the action or proceeding or any
part thereof, or enter a judgment by default against that party, or impose
other penalties of a lesser nature as otherwise provided by law, and may order
that party or his or her counsel to pay to the moving party the reasonable
expenses in making the motion, including reasonable attorney fees. No penalty may be imposed under this section without prior
notice to, and an opportunity to be heard by, the party against whom the
penalty is sought to be imposed.
(b) It is the intent of the
Legislature that if a failure to comply with these rules is the responsibility
of counsel and not of the party, any penalty shall be imposed on counsel and
shall not adversely affect the party's cause of action or defense thereto.”
 
Citing Los Angeles Superior Court, Local Rule 3.10,
Plaintiffs argue that Defendant’s failure to file a First Amended Answer within
the time ordered by the Court warrants striking Defendant’s answer and barring Defendant
from asserting any affirmative defenses. 
Local Rule 3.10 provides, in relevant part,  that “[t]he court may impose appropriate
sanctions for the failure or refusal to comply with the rules of this chapter,
including the time standards and/or deadlines, and any court order made
pursuant to the rules.  Counsel are
directed to Code of Civil Procedure sections . . . 575.2 . . . .  The sanctions may be imposed on a party and,
if appropriate, on counsel for that party. ”
 
Notably, Plaintiffs do not cite CCP 435 and/or CCP 436 as
authority for the motion to strike as doing so would have required Plaintiff to
meet and confer before filing a motion to strike the answer.  See CCP 435.5.  Plaintiff essentially concedes never
contacting Defendant’s counsel to inquire about the failure to file the First Amended
Answer as ordered by the Court before this motion was filed by arguing that “[i]t
is not Plaintiffs’ responsibility nor duty to remind Defendants’ four attorneys
of their deadlines.”  (See Reply,
p.6:4-5).  
 
The Court finds that the sanction of striking Defendant’s
answer and barring Defendant from asserting any affirmative defenses in this
action which is tantamount to terminating sanctions are too harsh under the
circumstances. 
 
The Court notes that the opposition indicates that an
Amended Answer is attached thereto as Exhibit A.  (See Opposition, p.5:15-16, p.6:13).  However, no exhibit or proposed Amended
Answer is attached to the opposition.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is denied without prejudice.  Defendant is ordered to file and serve the
First Amended Answer on or before 11/22/24. 
If Defendant fails to file and serve the First Amended Answer by
11/22/24, Plaintiff may renew its request to strike Defendant’s answer.
