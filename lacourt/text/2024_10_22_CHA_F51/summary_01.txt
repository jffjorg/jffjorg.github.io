And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to quash a deposition subpoena for business records served on non-party Cornerstone First Mortgage. The defendant argued that the subpoena violates a temporary restraining order and seeks to harass him, but the plaintiff argued that the subpoena is necessary to understand whether the defendant's new employment with Cornerstone is a continuation or redirection of the company's goodwill and client base. The judge agreed with the plaintiff that there is good cause for the production of the documents at issue and that the subpoena is not violative of the restraining order. The judge also noted that the defendant failed to provide a copy of the subpoena for review and failed to provide a separate statement highlighting specific document requests at issue within the subpoena.
