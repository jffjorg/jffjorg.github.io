```

And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Jane Doe's motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents in part, as Defendant County of Los Angeles has already identified the documents supporting their responses to certain requests. However, the Court finds that further responses are necessary to requests seeking documents showing the County's evidence retention policies for unsolved sexual assaults.

The Court also grants Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for admission, as the requests seek relevant and discoverable information. The Court declines to award sanctions against Plaintiff at this time, as Plaintiff has provided some response to the relevant requests.

The Court grants Defendant's motion to compel compliance with the Court's January 11, 2024 order, ordering Plaintiff to respond to certain discovery requests. The Court also denies Plaintiff's motion for a protective order, finding that Plaintiff must respond to discovery requests seeking basic information about herself and her contentions in the suit.

The parties are ordered to serve further responses to the subject discovery within 10 days of notice of ruling.
