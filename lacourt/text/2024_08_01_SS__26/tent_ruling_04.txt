ANALYSIS:
 
On December 4, 2023, Plaintiff
Emeka Victor Okwudili Peter (“Plaintiff”) filed the
Complaint in this action against Defendant Cooperative Regions of Organic
Producer Pools (“Defendant CROPP”) and others for (1) general negligence
against all Defendants; (2) negligence per se against all Defendants; (3)
strict liability against all Defendants; and (4) negligent hiring, retention,
and control of employees against Defendants Ralphs Grocery Company d/b/a Ralphs and Kroger Company. On May 7, 2024, the Court sustained
Defendant CROPP’s demurrer to the Complaint without leave to amend and granted
its motion to strike portions of the Complaint with 30 days’ leave to amend.
(Minute Order, 05/07/24.) To date, Plaintiff has not filed an amended
Complaint.
 
Defendant CROPP filed the instant
Motion to Dismiss on June 11, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
Code of Civil Procedure, section
581, subdivision (f)(1) provides that upon motion of any party, the Court may
dismiss the Complaint when a defendant’s demurrer is sustained without leave to
amend and either party moves for dismissal. In light of the Court’s ruling
sustaining Defendant CROPP’s Demurrer without leave to amend and the instant
Motion, dismissal of Plaintiff’s Complaint is appropriate at to Defendant
CROPP.
 
Also, Code of Civil Procedure,
section 581, subdivision (f)(4) provides that upon motion of any party, the
Court may dismiss the Complaint when a defendant’s motion to strike is granted
with leave to amend and the plaintiff does not amend within the time provided.
Based on the Court’s May 7, 2024 ruling granting Defendant CROPP’s motion to
strike with leave to amend and Plaintiff’s failure to file an amended pleading
within the 30 days permitted, dismissal is also proper under this statute. Nor
has Plaintiff filed an opposition to the instant Motion to Dismiss. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Cooperative Regions of Organic Producer Pools’
Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED. PLAINTIFF EMEKA VICTOR OKWUDILI PETER’S COMPLAINT
IS DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE AS TO DEFENDANT COOPERATIVE REGIONS OF ORGANIC
PRODUCER POOLS.
