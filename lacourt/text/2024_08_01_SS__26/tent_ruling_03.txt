v. Navy Federal Credit Union, et al.DEMURRER(CCP § 430.10, et seq.)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendant Navy Federal Credit Union’s
Demurrer to the Complaint is OVERRULED AS TO THE FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION FOR
VIOLATION OF THE ROSENTHAL FAIR DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES ACT AND SUSTAINED
WITH 20 DAYS’ LEAVE TO AMEND AS TO THE SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION FOR VIOLATION OF
THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTING AGENCIES ACT.
 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 

On November 7, 2023, Plaintiff Jason
Alan (“Plaintiff”) filed the Complaint in this action against Defendant Navy
Federal Credit Union (“Defendant”). On May 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed a First
Amended Complaint alleging (1) violation of the Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Practices
Act; and (2) violation of the California Consumer Credit Reporting Agencies
Act. 
 
On June 4, 2024, Defendant filed a
Motion for Protective Order, which is set for hearing on August 6, 2024. Defendant
filed the instant Demurrer to the First Amended Complaint on June 7, 2024. Plaintiff
filed an opposition on July 16, 2024 and Defendant replied on July 25, 2024.
 
Discussion
 
The Demurrer is accompanied by a
meet and confer declaration as required by Code of Civil Procedure section
430.41. (Meet and Confer Decl., filed
06/07/24, ¶2.) Defendant contends this is a general demurrer to
each cause of action, but initially raises questions of personal and subject
matter jurisdiction. (Notice of Demurrer, p. 2.) 
 
Defendant has already made a
personal appearance in this action by filing the Motion for Protective Order. (Dial
800 v. Fesbinder (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 32, 52 [“A general appearance
occurs when the defendant takes part in the action or in some manner recognizes
the authority of the court to proceed.”].) The challenge on the basis that the
Court lacks personal jurisdiction over Defendant, therefore, is without merit. 
 
Nor can Defendant challenge
subject matter jurisdiction by way of a special demurrer in a limited
jurisdiction court. (Code Civ. Proc., § 92, subd. (c); Workmen's Comp.
Appeals Bd. v. Small Claims Court (1973) 35 Cal.App.3d 643, 646.) If
Defendant seeks to challenge subject matter jurisdiction, it should bring a
properly noticed motion to dismiss or quash on those grounds.
 
Finally, Defendant generally
demurs to the second cause of action for violation of the California Consumer Credit
Reporting Agencies Act (“CCRAA”). The CCRAA prohibits a person from “furnish[ing]
information on a specific transaction or experience to any consumer credit
reporting agency if the person knows or should know the information is
incomplete or inaccurate.” (Civ. Code, § 1785.25, subd. (a).) “To establish a
CCRAA claim, plaintiff must show that: (1) defendant is a ‘person’ under the
CCRAA; (2) defendant reported information to a CRA; (3) the information
reported was inaccurate; (4) plaintiff was harmed; and (5) defendant knew or
should have known that the reported information was inaccurate.” (Kihagi v.
Nationstar Mortg., LLC (C.D. Cal. 2023) 2023 WL 5667570, at *4.) Furthermore,
as a statutory cause of action, each element must be alleged with particularity.
(City of Los Angeles v. Superior Court (2023) 62 Cal. App. 5th
129, 138.) 
 
The First Amended Complaint alleges that “Defendant
has repeatedly failed to conduct legally required investigations into disputes
raised by Plaintiff regarding inaccurate and derogatory information reported on
his consumer credit reports, in direct violation of the Fair Credit Reporting
Act (FCRA) and California Civil Code § 1785.25(a).” (FAC, ¶7.) Also, it alleges
that Plaintiff has observed numerous inaccuracies in the information reported
on his consumer credit reports, which included erroneous balances and account
statuses. (Id. at ¶8.) These inaccuracies allegedly caused substantial
harm to Plaintiff's creditworthiness and led to unfair denials of credit. (Id.
at ¶9.) The Court agrees that these allegations lack sufficient specificity to
state that the information reported by Defendant was inaccurate, that Plaintiff
was harmed as a result of those inaccuracies, and Defendant knew or should have
known of the inaccuracies. The allegations only refer generally to “numerous
inaccuracies” in two credit accounts without further identifying information.
Plaintiff allegedly submitted disputes regarding this inaccurate information
through the credit reporting agencies but does not include relevant details in
the pleading. The First Amended Complaint, therefore, does not allege facts
sufficient to state a cause of action for violation of the CCRAA and the
Demurrer is sustained as to the second cause of action.
 
Leave to amend must be allowed
where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment and the burden
is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be amended
successfully. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) In light
of Plaintiff’s opposition to the Demurrer, the Court allows leave to amend to
include the necessary information. 
  
Conclusion
 
Defendant Navy Federal Credit Union’s Demurrer to the
Complaint is OVERRULED AS TO THE FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION FOR VIOLATION OF THE
ROSENTHAL FAIR DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES ACT AND SUSTAINED WITH 20 DAYS’ LEAVE
TO AMEND AS TO THE SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION FOR VIOLATION OF THE CALIFORNIA
CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTING AGENCIES ACT.
