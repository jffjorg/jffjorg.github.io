And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that Plaintiff Jennifer McGaughey's demurrer to Defendant Sunrun's Answer is sustained with 20 days' leave to amend as to the first through 24th affirmative defenses. The judge found that Defendant Sunrun's affirmative defenses failed to adequately allege facts and were instead simply legal conclusions. The judge cited California law, specifically California Code of Civil Procedure sections 430.20, 430.50, and 431.30, in making this determination. The judge also noted that Defendant Sunrun's affirmative defenses contradicted the definition of an affirmative defense as set forth in case law. As a result, the judge granted Plaintiff's demurrer and gave Defendant Sunrun 20 days to amend its Answer.
