And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant Cooperative Regions of Organic Producer Pools' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff Emeka Victor Okwudili Peter's Complaint with prejudice. This means that the Complaint is dismissed and cannot be refiled. The judge's decision is based on the fact that Defendant CROPP's demurrer to the Complaint was sustained without leave to amend, and the Court granted Defendant CROPP's motion to strike portions of the Complaint with leave to amend. Despite being given 30 days to file an amended Complaint, Plaintiff failed to do so. As a result, the judge has concluded that dismissal of the Complaint is appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 581(f) and 581(f)(4).
