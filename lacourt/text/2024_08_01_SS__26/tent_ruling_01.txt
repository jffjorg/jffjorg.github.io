ANALYSIS:
 
On June 23, 2022, Plaintiff Interinsurance Exchange of the
Automobile Club (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action against Defendants Haroutun
Demirjian (“Defendant Demirjian”) and Stacy Martin (“Defendant Martin”). When
Defendants failed to file a responsive pleading, Plaintiff obtained their
default on October 11, 2023. Default judgment was entered against Defendant
Demirjian on December 7, 2023 and against Defendant Martin on December 21,
2023. Notice of entry of judgment was served on Defendants on April 8, 2024.
(Proof of Service, filed 04/08/24.) 
 
On June 7, 2024, Defendants filed the instant Motion to
Quash Service of Summons and Motion to Vacate Default and Default Judgment. No
opposition has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
Motion to Vacate Default and Default Judgment
 
Defendants move for relief on equitable grounds.
Specifically, that Plaintiff’s counsel’s conduct amounted to extrinsic fraud
when they sought to obtain default following defective service and without
informing defense counsel. The Court has inherent, equitable power to set aside
a judgment on the ground of “extrinsic fraud or mistake.” (Sporn v. Home
Depot USA, Inc.  (2005) 126 Cal. App
4th 1294, 1300). Extrinsic fraud “tends to encompass almost any set of
extrinsic circumstances which deprive a party of a fair adversary hearing.” (Estate
of Snaders v. Sutton (1985) 40 Cal 3d 607, 614.) 
 
Defense counsel submits a declaration explaining that they
have been in communication with Plaintiff’s counsel since June 9, 2023, at
which time they expressed that service on both Defendants was defective.
(Motion, Matevosian Decl., ¶¶6-8.) Defense counsel also informed Plaintiff’s
counsel that Defendant Demirjian was an active duty servicemember and explained
that his information would not appear on the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (“SCRA”)
website because he has a secret government clearance. (Id. at ¶¶10-12.) Also,
prior to Plaintiff’s second submission for entry of default in October 2023,
defense counsel made a settlement offer and was informed by Plaintiff’s counsel
that the offer would be communicated to Plaintiff. (Id. at ¶¶14-16.) Instead
of responding to the settlement offer, however, Plaintiff filed another request
for entry of default on October 11, 2023 without informing defense counsel. The
requests for entry of default were again served to addresses Plaintiff’s
counsel had been informed were defective, thereby depriving Defendants of the
opportunity to address the requests for entry of default. The Court finds that
these facts demonstrate a basis for granting Defendants equitable relief from
the default and default judgment. By failing to communicate with defense
counsel to address the issue of defective service and Defendants’ settlement
offer, Plaintiff deprived Defendants of an opportunity to respond to the action
on the merits. 
 
Furthermore, the Court finds Plaintiff’s counsel’s conduct
violated well-known ethical obligations:
 
“[I] is now well-acknowledged that
an attorney has an ethical obligation to warn opposing counsel that the
attorney is about to take an adversary's default. (Id. at pp. 701-702, 84
Cal.Rptr.3d 351.)
 
In that regard we heartily endorse
the related admonition found in The Rutter Group practice guide, and we note
the authors' emphasis on reasonable time: “Practice Pointer: If you're
representing plaintiff, and have had any contact with a lawyer representing
defendant, don't even attempt to get a default entered without first giving
such lawyer written notice of your intent to request entry of default, and a
reasonable time within which defendant's pleading must be filed to prevent your
doing so.” (Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial
(The Rutter Group 2008) § 5:73, p. 5-19 (rev. #1, 2008) as quoted in Fasuyi,
supra, 167 Cal.App.4th at p. 702, 84 Cal.Rptr.3d 351.)”
 
(Lasalle v. Vogel (2019) 36 Cal.App.5th 127, 135.) Here,
Plaintiff’s counsel was in communication with defense counsel regarding this
action since June 2023 but did not inform defense counsel of the request for
entry of default filed in October 2023. 
 
Based on the foregoing, Defendants’ Motion to Vacate Default
and Default Judgment is granted. 
 
Motion to Quash Service of the Summons and Complaint
 
Defendants move to quash service of the Summons
and Complaint pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 418.10 on the grounds
that the service address, 445 W. Wilson Avenue, #E/1, Glendale, California, was
not proper as to either of them. 
 
“When a defendant
challenges the court’s personal
jurisdiction on the ground of improper service of process ‘the burden is on the
plaintiff to prove the existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the
facts requisite to an effective service.’”  (Summers v. McClanahan (2006) 140
Cal.App.4th 403, 413.) A proof of service containing a declaration from a
registered process server invokes a rebuttable presumption affecting the
burden of producing evidence, of the facts stated in the return. (Cal.
Evid. Code, § 647; see American Express Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011)
199 Cal.App.4th 383, 390.) The party seeking to defeat service of process must
present sufficient evidence to show that the service did not take place as
stated.  (See Palm Property Investments, LLC v. Yadegar (2011) 194
Cal.App.4th 1419, 1428; cf. People
v. Chavez (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 1471, 1483 [“If some fact be presumed, the opponent of that fact bears
the burden of producing or going forward with evidence sufficient to overcome
or rebut the presumed fact.”].)  Merely
denying service took place without more is insufficient to overcome the
presumption.  (See Yadegar, supra, 194 Cal.App.4th
at 1428.)
 
The supporting declaration of Defendant
Dermirjian, however, is not properly attested as required by Code of Civil
Procedure section 2015.5. A declaration must recite “recites that it is
certified or declared by him or her to be true under penalty of perjury, is
subscribed by him or her, and (1), if executed within this state, states the
date and place of execution, or (2), if executed at any place, within or
without this state, states the date of execution and that it is so certified or
declared under the laws of the State of California.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2015.5.) Defendant Demerjian only declares “under penalty of perjury under the laws
of the United States that the foregoing is true and correct.” (Motion to
Quash, Demerjian Decl., p. 1:26-27.) Defendant Demerjian, therefore, has not
shown a basis to quash service of the Summons and Complaint. 
 
Defendant Martin’s declaration is properly attested and
states that at the time of service on March 27, 2023, they did not reside at 445 W. Wilson Avenue, #E/1, Glendale, California. (Motion to Quash, Martin
Decl., ¶¶4-9 and Exhs. C-E.) Although the proof of service of the Summons and
Complaint is signed by a registered process server, Defendant Martin’s
declaration presents sufficient evidence to
show that the service did not take place as stated.  (See Proof of Substitute Service, filed
04/05/24, ¶7.) Plaintiff has not filed any opposition to dispute Defendant
Martin’s declaration. Therefore, the Motion to Quash is granted as to Defendant
Martin. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, Defendants Harotun Demirjian and
Stacy Martin’s Motion to Vacate Default and Default Judgment is GRANTED.
 
Defendants Harotun Demirjian and Stacy Martin’s Motion to
Quash Service of the Summons and Complaint is GRANTED AS TO DEFENDANT MARTIN
AND CONTINUED AS TO DEFENDANT DEMIRJIAN TO OCTOBER 31, 2024 AT 10:00 AM IN
DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE. BY OCTOBER 3, 2024, DEFENDANT
DEMIRJIAN IS TO FILE AND SERVE AN AMENDED DECLARATION IN CONFORMITY WITH THE
STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS.
