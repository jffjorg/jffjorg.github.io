And here is an English summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge grants the plaintiff's motion to compel responses to interrogatories served on the defendants, Daniel Andres Forero and Jose Gabriel Montoya, Jr., and requests sanctions. The defendants failed to serve verified responses to the interrogatories despite a meet and confer effort. The Judge finds that the defendants' failure to respond constitutes a misuse of the discovery process and awards sanctions of $265.00 to the plaintiff's counsel. The defendants are ordered to serve verified responses to the interrogatories without objections within 20 days and to pay the sanctions within the same timeframe.
