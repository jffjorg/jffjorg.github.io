And here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses a demurrer filed by Navy Federal Credit Union to the Complaint and First Amended Complaint filed by Jason Alan. The demurrer challenges the Court's personal and subject matter jurisdiction, as well as the allegations in the Complaint. The Court finds that the defendant has already made a general appearance in the action by filing a motion for protective order, and therefore, the challenge to personal jurisdiction is without merit. The Court also finds that the defendant cannot challenge subject matter jurisdiction by way of a special demurrer in a limited jurisdiction court.

The Court sustains the demurrer as to the second cause of action for violation of the California Consumer Credit Reporting Agencies Act, finding that the allegations lack sufficient specificity to state a cause of action. However, the Court overrules the demurrer as to the first cause of action for violation of the Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. The Court grants Plaintiff leave to amend the Complaint to include the necessary information to state a cause of action for violation of the California Consumer Credit Reporting Agencies Act.
