ANALYSIS:
 
On January 23, 2024, Plaintiff Interinsurance Exchange of
the Automobile Club (“Plaintiff”) served Form Interrogatories, Set One, on
Defendants Daniel Andres Forero (“Defendant Forero”) and Jose Gabriel Montoya,
Jr. (“Defendant Montoya, Jr.”) (Motions, Tapper
Decl., Exh. A.) Despite a meet and confer effort, to date, Defendants Forero
and Montoya, Jr. have not served verified responses to the Form
Interrogatories, Set One. (Id. at ¶3 and Exh. B.) Plaintiff filed the
instant (1) Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories Served on Daniel
Andres Forero and Request for Sanctions; and (2) Motion to Compel Responses to
Form Interrogatories Served on Jose Gabriel Montoya, Jr. and Request for
Sanctions, on June 17, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
Based on Defendants Forero and Montoya, Jr.’s failure to
serve initial responses to the discovery, the Motions to Compel Responses to
Interrogatories, are granted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.) There is no
requirement for a prior meet and confer effort before a motion to compel
initial responses can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.) Furthermore, the
motion can be brought at any time after the responding party fails to provide
the responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.) Therefore, Plaintiff is entitled
to an order compelling Defendants Forero and Montoya, Jr. to serve verified
responses to the interrogatories without objections.
 
Defendants Forero and Montoya, Jr.’s failure to timely
respond constitutes a misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.010, subd. (d).) Sanctions are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure
sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 and have been properly noticed. However, the
amount sought is excessive for simple and unopposed motions. Pursuant to a
lodestar calculation, sanctions are awarded against each Defendant in the
amount of $265.00 based on one hour of attorney time billed at $225.00 per hour,
plus the $40.00 filing fee. (Motions, Tapper Decl., ¶4.)
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club’s
(1) Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories Served on Daniel Andres
Forero and Request for Sanctions; and (2) Motion to Compel Responses to Form
Interrogatories Served on Jose Gabriel Montoya, Jr. and Request for Sanctions,
are GRANTED. DEFENDANTS DANIEL ANDRES FORERO AND JOSE GABRIEL MONTOYA, JR. ARE
TO SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES TO THE INTERROGATORIES, WITHOUT OBJECTIONS, WITHIN
20 DAYS’ NOTICE OF THIS ORDER. DEFENDANTS DANIEL ANDRES FORERO AND JOSE GABRIEL
MONTOYA, JR. ARE EACH ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $265.00 TO PLAINTIFF’S
COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ NOTICE OF THIS ORDER.
