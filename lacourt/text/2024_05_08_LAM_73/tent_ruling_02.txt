I. BACKGROUND
 
On June 20,
2018, plaintiffs Shonna Marie Counter, Garry Michael Kann, Mark Frankel,
Douglas Fauth, Herminio Escobar, Shaina Negron, Tyler Hilliman, Samuel Saez
III, Gary Brian Bloom, Keith Milo, Ryan Cahouet, and Malik Jeter (collectively,
“Plaintiffs”) filed this action against defendants Kaf Industries, Inc., (“Kaf
Inc.”) and Kevin Farhang (“Farhang”).  
 
On February
10, 2020, Plaintiffs filed their operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”)
against Kaf Inc. and Farhang asserting the following causes of action: 
 
1.              
Negligence.  
2.              
Premises liability.  
3.              
Nuisance.  
4.              
Negligent failure to provide habitable
premises.  
5.              
Breach of implied warranty of
habitability.  
6.              
Excessive collection of rent (Los
Angeles Municipal Code (“LAMC”) § 151.041 et 
seq.). 
7.              
Breach of covenant of quiet
enjoyment.  
8.              
Intentional infliction of emotional
distress.  
9.              
Collection of rent on a substandard
dwelling (Civil Code § 1942.4). 
10.           
Failure to pay relocation
assistance.  
11.           
Respondeat superior.  
12.           
Violation of Unruh Civil Rights
Act.  
 
Before
Plaintiffs filed their SAC, defendant Farhang filed a Cross-Complaint against
Plaintiffs and cross-defendants Larissa Shadchina and Cliff Brodsky, on October
28, 2019, asserting the following causes of action: 
 
1.              
Indemnity. 
2.              
Apportionment of fault. 
3.              
Waste. 
4.              
Negligence. 
5.              
Declaratory relief. 
 
On December 13,
2023, following a jury trial, the Court entered judgment for Plaintiffs against
Defendants, specifically on the causes of action for excessive collection of
rent and failure to pay relocation assistance. Cross-Complainant Farhang prevailed
against Cross-Defendant Ryan Calhout on a cause of action for negligence.
 
On December
13, 2023, Cross-Defendant Larissa Shadchina filed an Ex Parte
Emergency Meeting requesting the Court to set aside and overturn the ruling. On
December 14, 2023, the Court denied Shadchina’s motion. 
 
A.    
Allegations in Plaintiffs’ SAC
 
The SAC
alleges the following. This action concerns properties located at 1643-16545 of
S. La Cienega Blvd., Los Angeles, California (the “Building”). (SAC, ¶ 1,
6-17.)  
 
Farhang is
the owner and manager of the Building. (SAC, ¶ 19.) Larissa Shadchina
(“Shadchina”) was Farhang’s property manager. (SAC, ¶ 3.) Shadchina used
websites such as Homeaway.com and Airbnb.com, as well as personal referrals, to
enter into sub-leases with numerous individuals. (SAC, ¶ 136.) Shadchina agreed
to pay Farhang about one half of rent moneys she received from sub-tenants
residing in the premises. (SAC, ¶ 136.)  
 
The Building
was constructed in 1958, and never intended to be a residential property. (SAC,
¶ 25.) Indeed, after Farhang took over ownership of the Building in 2006 but
before 2017, he rented out the units to many retail businesses, including an
illegal massage parlor that was raided and shut down by the police. (SAC, ¶
26.) 
 
After the
massage parlor business failed, that section of the Building was illegally
converted into 12 cramped and illegal residential units. (SAC, ¶¶ 1, 27.)
Farhang began renting what would have been massage rooms as residential
apartments. (SAC, ¶ 27.) Despite changing the property from a commercial to a
residential building, Farhang failed to obtain permits to convert the Building
to residential units. (SAC, ¶ 27.) He also failed to make the Building safe for
human occupancy. (SAC, ¶ 27.) 
 
Plaintiffs
(each of them individually) entered into a landlord-tenant relationship with
Farhang in 2017 for some, and 2018 for others. (SAC, ¶¶ 6-17.) By virtue of the
landlord-tenant relationship and oral lease agreements, Farhang owed Plaintiffs
a duty to maintain the Building in a habitable condition. (SAC, ¶ 73.) Instead,
the Building had no running water, had a defective plumbing system, did not
have adequate security, was infested with cockroaches, bed bugs, and rodents,
among other conditions. (SAC, ¶¶ 28-32.) In addition, on or about May 21, 2018,
Shadchina turned off the electricity and attempted to flee the building without
explanation, running over one of the Plaintiffs with her vehicle. (SAC, ¶ 3.)
As a result of the Building’s dilapidated conditions and pest infestations, the
Plaintiffs suffered a range of health of problems, including bed bug bites,
asthma, serious allergies, frequent colds, nausea, vomiting, headaches, and
nosebleeds. (SAC, ¶ 32.) Those that had disabilities saw their conditions
exacerbated. (SAC, ¶ 32.) Nevertheless, despite (1) those deplorable conditions
and (2) the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety (“LADBS”) issuing a
Substandard Order and Notice of Fee (indicating that the Building was not
approved for residential housing and, therefore, could not collect rent from
the “tenants”), Farhang charged, and Plaintiffs paid exorbitant rents, up to
$2,000 per month. (SAC, ¶¶ 4, 34.) Therefore, Plaintiffs are bringing this
action to vindicate their rights and to redress the physical, emotional, and
economic injuries they have suffered. (SAC, ¶ 4.) 
 
B.    
Allegations in Farhang’s Cross-Complaint
 
Brodsky and
Shadchina communicated to Farhang their desire to create a short-term
“Airbnb-type” rental program in the Building, which the cross-defendants would
personally manage and oversee. (XC, ¶ 20.) Therefore, in approximately January
2017, Farhang and the cross-defendants entered into a verbal agreement to lease
a section of the Building. (Farhang’s Cross-Complaint (“XC”), ¶ 20.)  
 
The
cross-defendants represented to Farhang that they would faithfully discharge
their duty to protect and maintain the Building. (XC, ¶ 39.) Instead, as
illustrated through photographs and other documentary evidence, the
cross-defendants caused extensive damage in excess of $40,000. (XC, ¶¶ 21, 42.)
Those damages included damage to the Building’s furniture, flooring, carpeting,
and electrical components. (XC, ¶ 22.) As a result of the damages, Farhang has
been prevented from leasing the Building to interest third parties and lost
income. (XC, ¶ 23.) 
 
C.     Cross-Defendant
Larissa Shadchina’s Motion for Reconsideration
 
On
February 8, 2024, Cross-Defendant Larissa Shadchina filed the instant Motion for Reconsideration.
Shadchina’s motion appears to be an amended version of the Ex Parte Emergency
Meeting Application that she filed on December 13, 2023. The Ex Parte Emergency
Meeting Application requests that the Court overturn the December
13, 2023 ruling in
which the Court entered judgment for Plaintiffs against Defendants. 
 
No
opposition or reply have been filed.
 
II.DISCUSSION
 
A.    
Review by a Different Judge
 
As an initial matter, the Court addresses whether a judge who
did not make the initial ruling can consider this motion.
 
Generally, a motion for reconsideration must be made to the
same judge.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008(a); Marriage of Oliverez
(2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1242, 1248.)  “However, there are narrow exceptions
to this general rule.”  (Marriage of Oliverez, supra, 238
Cal.App.4th at 1248.)  “‘[W]here the judge who made the initial
ruling is unavailable to reconsider the motion, a different judge may entertain
the reconsideration motion.’”  (Id. (quoting Ziller Electronics
Lab GmbH v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 1222, 1232) (alteration in
original).)  “Another exception is when the facts have changed or when the
judge has considered further evidence and law.”  (Id.) 
“Additionally, a second judge may reverse a prior ruling of another judge if
the record shows that it was based on inadvertence, mistake, or fraud.”  (Id.
at 1248-49.)  “Mere disagreement . . . with the prior trial judge’s
ruling, however, is not enough to overturn that ruling.”  (Id. at
1249.)   
 
Here, it appears Plaintiff’s motion moves for reconsideration
of the December 14, 2024 order made in this Department, Department 73, by Judge
Timothy Dillon. However, the Court finds that Judge Dillon is unavailable to
hear the instant Motion due to his temporary reassignment to another Department.
Therefore, the Court finds that the assigned judge to Department 73, Judge Rolf
Treu, may consider this motion. 
 
B.    
Motion for Reconsideration
 
The moving party must present new facts, circumstances or law
in order to grant a motion for reconsideration.  (See CCP § 1008(a); see
also Mink v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1338, 1342.)  The
party seeking reconsideration of an order shall state by affidavit what
application was made before, what order or decisions were made, and what new or
different facts or circumstances are claimed to be shown.  (CCP §
1008(a).)  Further, “…the party seeking reconsideration must provide not
only new evidence but also a satisfactory explanation for the failure to
produce that evidence at an earlier time.” (Glade v. Glade (1995) 38
Cal.App.4th 1441, 1457 [emphasis added].)  The legislative intent was to
restrict motions for reconsideration to circumstances where a party offers the
court some fact or circumstance not previously considered and some valid reason
for not offering it earlier. (Gilberd v. AC Transit (1995) 32
Cal.App.4th 1494, 1500.) 
 
On December 13, 2023, Shadchina filed an Ex Parte
Emergency Meeting Application following the ruling in this case in which the
Court entered judgment for Plaintiffs against Defendants. The Ex Parte Emergency Meeting Application requests
that the Court overturn the ruling in this case. 
 
On December 14, 2023, the Court issued an order
denying Shadchina’s Ex Parte Emergency Meeting Application. The Court stated: “The court
reviews and considers the ex parte application, without a hearing, in chambers.
The Ex Parte Application Emergency Meeting filed by Larissa Shadchina on
12/13/2023 is Denied. There is no basis for the court to grant any relief at
this point. The moving party has failed to make an affirmative factual showing
of irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for
granting ex parte relief.” (See Court’s 12/14/23 Order.)
 
On February 8, 2024, Shadchina filed the instant motion which
states on the cover page that it is an amended version of the Ex Parte
Emergency Meeting Application she had filed on December 13, 2023. However, Shadchina
does not specify how this amended version is different than the motion she had
filed on December 13, 2023. After a review of both motions, it appears
Shadchina puts forth the same arguments. Thus, Shadchina fails to present
the Court with any new argument or facts. The Court finds that Shadchina has
failed to make an affirmative factual showing of facts or evidence that she
could not have previously discovered and produced at the hearing that could
affect the Court’s prior ruling.
 
Based on the
foregoing, the Court does not grant Shadchina’s motion for reconsideration.
 
CONCLUSION 
 
Accordingly, the motion
for reconsideration is DENIED.
