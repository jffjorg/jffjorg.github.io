English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a lawsuit filed by Marcos Garcia and Esperanza Garcia against Luzelena Ruffalo. The plaintiffs are seeking a trial preference due to their advanced age and health issues. However, the judge has denied the motion, citing the plaintiffs' failure to comply with the requirements of CCP ยง 36(c)(1) and their inability to demonstrate that their health is such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing their interest in the litigation. The judge also notes that the plaintiffs' motion is no longer applicable since Marcos Garcia has passed away.
