And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The tentative ruling is a summary of the court's decision regarding the demurrer filed by the defendants. The court finds that the defendants' demurrer to all of the plaintiff's causes of action against David Ahn is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.

The court also finds that the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's first, second, third, fourth, and fifth causes of action is overruled. On the other hand, the court sustains the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth causes of action with 20 days leave to amend.

The court's summary of the plaintiff's allegations includes claims of breach of contract, lockout, and unfair business practices. The court finds that some of the plaintiff's allegations are insufficiently pleaded and fails to state a cause of action.
