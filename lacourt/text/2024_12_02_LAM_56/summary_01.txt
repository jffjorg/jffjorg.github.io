And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motion to transfer venue from Los Angeles County to Ventura County, filed by the defendants Kevin Young and Properties GB7 LLC. The defendants argue that venue is improper in Los Angeles County because none of the alleged wrongful acts took place there, none of the defendants reside or do business there, and the plaintiff did not file the complaint in the proper court. The Court finds that the defendants have waived their right to transfer venue due to unreasonable delay, as they waited approximately 20 months to file the motion and previously filed motions that did not raise venue-related arguments. Therefore, the motion is denied.
