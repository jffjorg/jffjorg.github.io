significant_statements:
  - "The strong public policy in favor of arbitration is reflected in California law and federal law."
  - "The arbitration agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted and to make all disputes and claims between the parties subject to arbitration to the maximum extent permitted by law."
  - "A party need not sign an agreement to be bound by it. A party may accept a contract by conduct, as well as by words."
  - "In determining waiver, a court can consider whether the party's actions are inconsistent with the right to arbitrate; whether the litigation machinery has been substantially invoked; whether a party either requested arbitration enforcement close to the trial date or delayed for a long period before seeking a stay; whether a defendant seeking arbitration filed a counterclaim without asking for a stay of the proceedings; whether important intervening steps had taken place; and whether the delay affected, misled, or prejudiced the opposing party."

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted Hyundai Motor America's motion to compel arbitration and stay action in this case. The court finds that the arbitration agreement is enforceable and that the plaintiff, Marco Ramos, has waived his right to arbitration. The court also finds that the agreement is not procedurally or substantively unconscionable. The case is stayed pending completion of arbitration, and the parties are ordered to submit a joint statement regarding the status of arbitration at a future hearing.
