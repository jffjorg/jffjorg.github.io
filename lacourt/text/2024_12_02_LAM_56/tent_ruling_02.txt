RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff
NICHOLAS ASTOR (“Plaintiff”)
 
            The Court has considered the moving,
opposition and reply papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
             This case relates to a home improvement
contract at Plaintiff’s property located at 4645/4647 Ethel Ave., Sherman Oaks,
CA 91423.  The operative First Amended
Complaint (“FAC”) asserts the following causes of action: (1) breach of
contract; (2) negligence; (3) negligence; (4) breach of contract; (5) professional
negligence; (6) accounting; (7) rescission – violation of Business and Professions
Code section 7159 and Civil Code section 1689.7; (8) fraud – intentional misrepresentation;
(9) disgorgement; (10) action on contractors bonds; and (11) action on
disciplinary bond.
 
            On August 19, 2024, Defendant filed a
Demurrer to Plaintiff’s FAC (“Demurrer”) and a Motion to Strike Allegations in
Plaintiff’s FAC (“Motion”).  On November
15, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition to the Demurrer and an opposition to the
Motion to Strike.  Defendant filed
replies on November 21, 2024. 
 
MEET AND CONFER 
             The parties’ respective counsel present conflicting
declarations regarding meet and confer efforts and timeliness of the Demurrer.  The Court, in its discretion, will proceed to
determine the merits of the Demurrer.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(4) [An insufficient meet and confer process is
not grounds to overrule or sustain a demurrer.].)  
 
DISCUSSION
Demurrer
            A demurrer can be used only to
challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack; or from
matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable.  (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal 3d 311,
318.)  No other extrinsic evidence can be
considered (i.e., no “speaking demurrers”).  (Ion Equipment Corp. v. Nelson¿(1980)
110 Cal.App.3d 868, 881.) 
 
A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal. App. 4th
740, 747.)  When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context.  (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dep’t of
Water & Power (2006) 144 Cal. App. 4th 1216, 1228.)  In a demurrer
proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via
proper judicial notice.  (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116
Cal. App. 4th 968, 994.)  “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not
the evidence or other extrinsic matters.  Therefore, it lies only where
the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed.”¿ (SKF
Farms v. Superior Ct. (1984) 153 Cal. App. 3d 902, 905.)  “The only
issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands,
unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.”¿ (Hahn, supra,
147 Cal.App.4th at 747.)¿ 
 
Here,
Defendant demurs to the 8th and 9th causes of action in
the FAC for fraud and disgorgement, respectively.
 
8th Cause of Action: Fraud – Intentional Misrepresentation
            The elements of fraud are: “(a)
misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b)
knowledge of falsity (or ‘scienter’); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce reliance;
(d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage.” (Charnay v. Cobert
(2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 170, 184.)  A cause of action for fraud must be
alleged with factual specificity.  Plaintiff must plead facts showing
“how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were
tendered. [Citation]” (Small v. Fritz Companies, Inc. (2003) 30
Cal.4th 167, 184.) 
            The FAC sets forth allegations
pertaining to the elements of fraud: misrepresentation (FAC, para. 72),
knowledge (para. 74), intent (para. 78), justifiable reliance (pars. 75-76) and
resulting damage (para. 77).  The
allegations also sufficiently explain “how, when, where, to whom, and by what
means” the representations were tendered. 
As an example, Plaintiff points to the following allegations: How
– willfully deleting language from the Agreement (FAC, para. 74 “willfully
deleted a portion of the statutory “Mechanic’s Lien Warning” notice” and
“included in the Agreement”); When – on or about November 19, 2019, the
contract date (FAC, para. 29); Where – in the Agreement (FAC, para. 74
“included in the Agreement”); To Whom – Plaintiff (FAC, para. 74 “would
have advised Plaintiff” and para. 29 “Plaintiff ASTOR and RENOVATIO DEFENDANTS
entered into an oral agreement memorialized in writing”); and By What Means
– in writing (FAC, para. 74 “deleted a portion of the statutory “Mechanic’s
Lien Warning” notice” and para. 29 “Plaintiff ASTOR and RENOVATIO DEFENDANTS
entered into an oral agreement memorialized in writing”).
 
Thus,
Plaintiff alleged sufficient facts to constitute fraud (misrepresentation).  Accordingly, the demurrer to this cause of
action is OVERRULED.
 
9th
Cause of Action: Disgorgement 
Business
and Professions Code section 7031 provides that “a person who utilizes the
services of an unlicensed contractor may bring an action in any court of
competent jurisdiction in this state to recover all compensation paid to an
unlicensed contractor for performance of any act or contract.”  (Cal. Bus.
& Prof. Code, § 7031(b).)
 
Plaintiff
has alleged that Defendant was unlicensed by virtue of (1) failing to maintain proper
workers compensation coverage to all employees or unlicensed subcontractors
(FAC, para. 80); and (2) failing to exercise direct supervision and control
over the construction operations (FAC, para. 81).  Plaintiff also alleged that he paid
compensation to Defendant for his services (FAC, para. 83: “at least $562,000
paid to Defendants…”). 
 
Plaintiff
has, therefore, stated a claim under this section.  The Court, therefore, OVERRULES
the demurrer to this claim. 
 
Motion to Strike 
The
court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it
deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any
pleading.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 436(a).)  The court may also strike all or any part of
any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a
court rule, or an order of the court.  (Id.,
§ 436(b).)  The grounds for a motion to
strike are that the pleading has irrelevant, false or improper matter, or has
not been drawn or filed in conformity with laws.  (Id., § 436.)  The grounds for moving to strike must appear
on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice.  (Id., § 437.)  “When the defect which justifies striking a
complaint is capable of cure, the court should allow leave to amend.”  (Vaccaro v. Kaiman (1998) 63
Cal.App.4th 761, 768.)
 
Here,
Defendant moves to strike, as relates to the 8th cause of action, Paragraph
78 at Page 17 of the FAC in its entirety, and Prayers for Relief Nos. 22, 23
and 24 of the FAC in their entirety. 
Defendant also moves to strike, as relates to the 9th cause
of action, Paragraphs 84 and 85 at Page 18 of the FAC in their entirety, and Prayers
for Relief Nos. 25 and 26 of the FAC in their entirety. 
 
Since
Plaintiff has pled the facts necessary to support its fraud and disgorgement
causes of of action, therefore, the request to strike allegations pertaining to
these causes of action and  resulting damages
should be denied.  There are, however,
insufficient allegations to support the request for punitive damages.  
 
Punitive Damages 
 California
Civil Code section 3294 authorizes the recovery of punitive damages in
non-contract cases where “the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud,
or malice . . . .”  (Civ. Code, § 3294(a).)  “‘Malice’ means conduct
which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or
despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and
conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.”  (Id. §
3294(c)(1).)  “‘Oppression’ means despicable conduct that subjects a person
to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person’s
rights.”  (Id., § 3294(c).)   “‘Fraud’ means an
intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact known
to the defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby
depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.” 
(Id., § 3294(c)(3).)  Punitive damages thus require more than the
mere commission of a tort.  (Taylor v. Superior Court (1979) 24
Cal.3d 890, 894-95.)  Specific facts must be pleaded in support of
punitive damages.  (Hillard v. A.H. Robins Co. (1983) 148
Cal.App.3d 374, 391-92.)
 
As
stated above, the FAC sufficiently alleges fraud and disgorgement, which allegations
are sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages.  
 
Accordingly,
the motion to strike punitive damages is DENIED.
 
 


 
RULING
            The Demurrer is OVERRULED in its
entirety.  The Motion is DENIED..
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
