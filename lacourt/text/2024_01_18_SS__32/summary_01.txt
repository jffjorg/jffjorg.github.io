And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion to enforce a settlement agreement between the plaintiffs, Janeth Malo and Ashley Leyva, and the defendant, The Estate of John Shing Lee. The settlement agreement was signed on June 7, 2023, and states that the defendant will pay the plaintiffs $375,000.00 in exchange for a release of all claims. However, the defendant has failed to prepare and submit a separate settlement agreement and general release of claims, as required by the proposal. The judge finds that the terms of the settlement agreement are sufficiently definite to constitute an agreement and grants the motion to enforce the settlement. The judge orders judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and dismisses the case with prejudice.
