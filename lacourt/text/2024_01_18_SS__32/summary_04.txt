English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion to continue the trial to October 2024. The trial was previously set for April 25, 2024. The defendants request the continuance because they were served the complaint on October 2, 2023, and have not yet responded to discovery requests or deposed the plaintiff. The court finds good cause to continue the trial based on the factors outlined in California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, including the proximity of the trial date and the need for further discovery. The court orders the trial date to be continued to October 1, 2024, at 8:30 AM in Department 32, and the final status conference to be continued to September 17, 2024, at 10:00 AM in Department 32.
