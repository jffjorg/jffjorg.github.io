Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the motion for a nunc pro tunc order correcting the date of filing on the complaint. The plaintiffs had contended that they filed the complaint on May 31, 2022, but it was rejected due to an insignificant defect. The judge finds that the clerk's rejection of the complaint was improper and that the complaint should be deemed filed on the date it was first presented for filing, which is May 31, 2022. However, the judge also finds that the motion is procedurally improper because the defendant has not been served with notice of the motion. Therefore, the motion is denied.
