And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies Century West BMW, LLC's motion to set aside default and default judgment without prejudice. The court finds that Century West failed to attach a copy of its proposed responsive pleading, as required by California Code of Civil Procedure § 473(b), and did not provide separate notice of motion stating the grounds under which it seeks relief, in violation of California Rules of Court Rule 3.1110. The court also notes that Century West's counsel's declaration states that the default was the result of improper service, which is governed by California Code of Civil Procedure § 473.5 and has separate requirements than those under California Code of Civil Procedure § 473. The court cannot determine the grounds upon which Century West seeks relief and therefore cannot grant the motion.
