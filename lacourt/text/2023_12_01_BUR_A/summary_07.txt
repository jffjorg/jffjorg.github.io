And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a motion to compel arbitration and stay the action brought by Guaranteed Rate, Inc. (the defendant) against John P. Shulak (the plaintiff). The plaintiff alleged wage and hour violations during his employment as a mortgage salesperson for the defendant. The defendant moved to compel arbitration and stay the action pending the District Court's decision on a related case.

The court found that the defendant has shown sufficient issue overlap to justify the imposition of a stay in this matter. The stay will remain in place until the District Court has rendered its decision on the motion to compel arbitration and dismiss representative claims. The court also ruled that the motion to compel arbitration is moot and that the representative claims cannot be ordered to arbitration.

The court ordered the action to be stayed pending the District Court's determination of the defendant's motion to compel arbitration. The motion to compel arbitration is also considered moot. The court set a status conference for May 8, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. to review the District Court's arbitration determination.
