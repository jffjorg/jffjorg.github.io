ALLEGATIONS: 
 
Plaintiff
Cadlerock Joint Venture, LP (“Plaintiff”) filed suit against Ajax Quality Linen
Uniform, Inc., Vahe Azoian (“Azoian”), Varoojan Azojan, Albert Voskansan, and
Bogos Karapetian (collectively “Defendants”) on February 19, 2021. Plaintiff’s
suit arises out of an alleged nonpayment of a business loan. The Complaint
contains causes of action for (1) breach of contract, (2) unjust enrichment,
(3) promissory estoppel, and (4) judicial foreclosure. 
 
Default
Judgment was entered by the court on December 29, 2021, in the amount of
$33,548.19.
 
Plaintiff
now applies for an order for the sale of property. Plaintiff requests the Court
issue an order that the property known as 3636 Urquidez Avenue, Glendale,
California 9120 (the “Property”). The Property is titled to Azoian and his wife
Violet Shahmuradyan as joint tenants. Azoian and Shahmuradyan have rendered no
response to Plaintiff’s application. 
  
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE: 
 
Plaintiff requests
judicial notice be granted of various documents, attached to their request as
exhibits, in support of its application. 
 
Plaintiff seeks
judicial notice of Exhibits A, B, C, D, E, F, H, K, and L pursuant to
California Evidence Code § 452(c). These documents appear to be recorded
property deeds and records of this Court concerning the judgment obtained
against defendants. As such, the Court finds they are judicially noticeable,
and Plaintiff’s request is GRANTED. 
 
Plaintiff seeks that
Exhibits G, I, J, and M be judicially noticed pursuant to California Evidence
Code § 452(g) &(h). These exhibits are: 
 
Historical Housing
Data prepared by the California Association of Realtors (Exh. G); 
 
the California
Consumer Price prepared by the Department of Industrial Relations (Exh. I); 
 
the Los Angeles
County Assessor’s Office report for the Property (Exh. J); 
 
and the Los Angeles
County Tax Collector report for the Property (Exh. M.).
 
The Court finds these
reports are of the type that are not reasonably subject to dispute and are
capable of immediate and accurate determination by resorting to sources of
reasonably indisputable accuracy. (C.C.P. § 452(h).) Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
request is GRANTED. 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
I.                   
LEGAL

The
judgment creditor's application shall be made under oath, shall describe the
dwelling, and shall contain all of the following:
 
(a) A statement
whether or not the records of the county tax assessor indicate that there is a
current homeowner's exemption or disabled veteran's exemption for the dwelling
and the person or persons who claimed any such exemption.
 
(b) A
statement, which may be based on information and belief, whether the dwelling
is a homestead and the amount of the homestead exemption, if any, and a
statement whether or not the records of the county recorder indicate that a
homestead declaration under Article 5 (commencing with Section 704.910) that
describes the dwelling has been recorded by the judgment debtor or the spouse
of the judgment debtor.
 
(c) A
statement of the amount of any liens or encumbrances on the dwelling, the name
of each person having a lien or encumbrance on the dwelling, and the address of
such person used by the county recorder for the return of the instrument
creating such person's lien or encumbrance after recording.
 
(d) A
statement that the judgment is based on a consumer debt, as defined in
subdivision (a) of Section 699.730, or that the judgment is not based on a
consumer debt, and if the judgment is based on a consumer debt, whether the
judgment is based on a consumer debt that was secured by the debtor's principal
place of residence at the time it was incurred or a statement indicating which
of the exemptions listed in subdivision (b) of Section 699.730 are applicable.
If the statement indicates that paragraph (7) of subdivision (b) is applicable,
the statement shall also provide the dollar amount of the original judgment on
which the lien is based. If there is more than one basis, the statement shall
indicate all bases that are applicable.
 
Order to
Show Cause Hearing & Service of Notice - C.C.P. § 704.770
 
(a) Upon
the filing of the application by the judgment creditor, the court shall set a
time and place for hearing and order the judgment debtor to show cause why an
order for sale should not be made in accordance with the application. The time
set for hearing shall be not later than 45 days after the application is filed
or such later time as the court orders upon a showing of good cause.
 
(b) Not
later than 30 days before the time set for hearing, the judgment creditor shall
do both of the following:
 
(1) Serve
on the judgment debtor a copy of the order to show cause, a copy of the
application of the judgment creditor, and a copy of the notice of the hearing
in the form prescribed by the Judicial Council. Service shall be made

(2)
Personally serve a copy of each document listed in paragraph (1) on an occupant

attempted, post a copy of each document in a conspicuous place at the dwelling.
 
Homestead
Exemption Burden of Proof - C.C.P. § 704.780
 
(a) The
burden of proof at the hearing is determined in the following manner:
 
(1) If
the records of the county tax assessor indicate that there is a current
homeowner's exemption or disabled veteran's exemption for the dwelling claimed
by the judgment debtor or the judgment debtor's spouse, the judgment creditor
has the burden of proof that the dwelling is not a homestead. If the records of
the county tax assessor indicate that there is not a current homeowner's
exemption or disabled veteran's exemption for the dwelling claimed by the
judgment debtor or the judgment debtor's spouse, the burden of proof that the
dwelling is a homestead is on the person who claims that the dwelling is a
homestead.
 
(2) If
the application states the amount of the homestead exemption, the person
claiming the homestead exemption has the burden of proof that the amount of the
exemption is other than the amount stated in the application.
 
(b) The
court shall determine whether the dwelling is exempt. If the court determines
that the dwelling is exempt, the court shall determine the amount of the
homestead exemption and the fair market value of the dwelling. The court shall
make an order for sale of the dwelling subject to the homestead exemption,
unless the court determines that the sale of the dwelling would not be likely
to produce a bid sufficient to satisfy any part of the amount due on the
judgment pursuant to Section 704.800. The order for sale of the dwelling
subject to the homestead exemption shall specify the amount of the proceeds of
the sale that is to be distributed to each person having a lien or encumbrance
on the dwelling and shall include the name and address of each such person.
Subject to the provisions of this article, the sale is governed by Article 6
(commencing with Section 701.510) of Chapter 3. If the court determines that
the dwelling is not exempt, the court shall make an order for sale of the
property in the manner provided in Article 6 (commencing with Section 701.510)
of Chapter 3.
 
(c) The
court clerk shall transmit a certified copy of the court order (1) to the
levying officer and 
 
(2) if
the court making the order is not the court in which the judgment was entered,
to the clerk of the court in which the judgment was entered.
 
(d) The
court may appoint a qualified appraiser to assist the court in determining the
fair market value of the dwelling. If the court appoints an appraiser, the
court shall fix the compensation of the appraiser in an amount determined by
the court to be reasonable, not to exceed similar fees for similar services in
the community where the dwelling is located.
 
Trust
Property Subject to Creditors – California Probate Code §§ 18200 & 18201
 
If the
settlor retains the power to revoke the trust in whole or in part, the trust
property is subject to the claims of creditors of the settlor to the extent of
the power of revocation during the lifetime of the settlor. (Cal. Prob. Code §
18200.) 
 
Any
settlor whose trust property is subject to the claims of creditors pursuant to
Section 18200 shall be entitled to all exemptions as provided in Chapter 4 of
Division 2 of Title 9 of Part 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure. (Cal. Prob.
Code § 18201.) 
 
Under
California law, a revocable inter vivos trust does not prevent creditors of the
settlors from reaching trust property. (Zanelli v. McGrath (2008) 166
Cal.App.4th 615, 633.) When property is held in this type of trust, the settlor
and lifetime beneficiary have the equivalent of full ownership of the property.
(Id. [internal quotations and citations omitted].) 
 
Community
Property
 
In In
re Brace (2020) 9 Cal.5th 903, 938, the Court expressly held that for
property acquired with community funds in or after 1985, the titling of a deed
as a joint tenancy is not sufficient to transmute the property into separate
property. Rather, for property acquired in or after 1975, the applied
presumption is that property acquired during the marriage is community
property. (Id.) 
 
II.                
MERITS 
 
Transfer & Judgment 
 
On September 21, 2001,
judgment creditor Azoian acquired title to the Property. (RJN Exh. A.) On
November 6, 2004, Azoian transferred the Property from himself to himself and
his wife, Shahmuradyan, as joint tenants. (RJN Exh. B.) On March 16, 2007, the
property was transferred to Azoian and Shahmuradyan, husband and wife, as joint
tenants. (RJN Exh. C.) 
 
On December 29, 2021, the
Court entered a default judgment against Ajax Quality Linen Uniform (“Ajax”)
and Azoian. (RJN Exh. D.) 
 
On February 11, 2022,
Azoian and Shahmuradyan transferred the Property from themselves to themselves
as trustees of the Varoojan and Violet Azoian Family Revocable Living Trust.
(RJN Exh. F.) The transfer deed reflects that this trust is a living revocable
trust. (Id.) The transfer deed to the trust was recorded on April 18,
2022. (Id.) 
 
On February 14, 2022, the
Court issued an abstract of judgment, which Plaintiff recorded on March 2,
2022. (RJN Exh. E.) The judgment amount entered was $33,548.19. (Id.) On
May 19, 2023, the Court issued a writ of judgment of $38,875.17. (RJN Exh. K.) 
 
Homeowner’s & Homestead
Exemption 
 
Plaintiff states that the
records of the Los Angeles County Assessor indicate no homeowner’s exemption
has been claimed by Azoian. (Walker Decl. ¶ 7, RJN Exh. J.) Nor do the records
indicate a disabled veteran exemption. (Id.) 
 
Plaintiff states that upon
information and belief the Property is the homestead of Azoian. Plaintiff
further states that Azoian is entitled to a homestead exemption by function of
statute in the amount of $626,400.00. (C.C.P. § 704.730.)  
 
C.C.P. § 704.730 provides
the following: 
 
(a)  
The
amount of the homestead exemption is the greater of the following:
 
1.     
The
countywide median sale price for a single-family home in the calendar year
prior to the calendar year in which the judgment debtor claims the exemption,
not to exceed six hundred thousand dollars ($600,000).
 
2.     
Three
hundred thousand dollars ($300,000).
 
(b)  
The
amounts specified in this section shall adjust annually for inflation,
beginning on January 1, 2022, based on the change in the annual California
Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers for the prior fiscal year,
published by the Department of Industrial Relations.
 
The homestead exemption
amount is the law in effect at the time the lien attached. (See Berhanu v.
Metzger (1992) 12 Cal.App.4th 445, 448.) Plaintiff states that at the time
the abstract of judgment was recorded, March 2022, the median price was
$809,750. (RJN Exh. G.) This amount would be in excess of the statutory
limitation of $600,000. The statutory amount of $600,000 is therefore adjusted for
inflation pursuant to the California Consumer Price Index for all Urban
Consumers, resulting in an exemption of $626,400. (See RJN Exh. I.) 
 
Encumbrances 
 
The liens and encumbrances
which are senior to Plaintiff’s abstract of judgment are listed below:

(Bowman Decl. ¶¶ 8-9, Exh.
A & Walker Decl. ¶ 11.) 
 
There are no liens and
encumbrances which are junior to Plaintiff’s abstract of judgment. (Id.)

 
Value of the Property 
 
Plaintiff states that the
Property currently has a real market value of $1,323,000, as determined by
Certified Residential Appraiser Sue A. Sauer. (Sauer Decl. ¶ 3, Exh A.) Saur’s
appraisal is reflected in her appraisal report, attached as Exhibit A to her
declaration, which was based on an exterior inspection of the Property and
sales data analysis of other homes in the area. The difference between the fair
market value and the encumbrances/homestead exemption is $397,395.82. (App. ¶
24.) 
 
Statement Required by
C.C.P. § 704.760(d) 
 
Plaintiff’s application
contains the statement required by statutes that the judgment is not based on
consumer debt. (App. ¶23.) 
 
Service Required by C.C.P.
§§ 704.770(b)(1)-(2)
 
The Court is satisfied that
Plaintiff has satisfied their obligation by posting the required documents at
the Property on November 1, 2023. (See Proof of Service by Posting filed
11/2/23.) Plaintiff also mailed the same to the address via Federal Express
overnight service on October 30, 2023. (See Proof of Mailing filed 11/2/23.)
 
Conclusion 
 
The Court finds Plaintiff’s
application satisfies the statutory requirements of C.C.P. §§ 704.760- 704.780.
Plaintiff has provided the Court with the means to determine the value of the
property as well as the encumbrances against it. Plaintiff has stated the
applicable homestead exemption and the Court agrees that the amount is
$626,400, as per the statutory limit adjusted for inflation. Plaintiff has
appropriately served notice of the order to show cause. 
 
The Court is satisfied that
the Property is legally qualified as community property within the complete
ownership of Azoian. Azoian’s transfer to the revocable inter vivos trust does
not stand as a barrier to a creditor’s application for sale of property as per
C.C.P. §§ 18200 & 18201. Further, pursuant to the ruling in In re Brace,
Azoian and Shahmuradyan own the Property as community property. Having acquired
title by joint tenancy in 2004, the presumption is that both Azoian and
Shahmuradyan own the Property in its entirety, and do not each possess a 50%
interest. 
 
Azoian, nor any other
defendant, have rendered any response to Plaintiff’s application. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
application is GRANTED.
