Moon v. Sguigna, et al.MOTION TO STRIKE COMPLAINT
(CCP §§ 435, 436)
TENTATIVE RULING: 
 
Defendant Joseph Sguigna’s Motion for Striking Portions From
Complaint is DENIED. DEFENDANT IS TO FILE AND SERVE AN ANSWER TO THE COMPLAINT
WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER. 
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
On September 27, 2023, Plaintiff Doo H. Moon (“Plaintiff”)
filed the instant action for breach of lease agreement against Defendant Joseph
Sguigna (“Defendant”). Following Defendant’s failure to file a responsive
pleading, the Court entered their default on November 27, 2023. Default judgment
was entered on December 6, 2023. On March 19, 2024, the Court granted
Defendant’s Motion to Vacate Default and Default Judgment and ordered Defendant
to file and serve the proposed Motion to Strike. (Minute Order, 03/19/24.)
 
Defendant filed the instant Motion to Strike Portions of the
Complaint on April 18, 2024. Plaintiff filed an opposition on May 9, 2024.  
 
Discussion
 
The Motion to Strike is
procedurally defective. First, the Motion is not accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 435.5. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 435.5, subd. (a) [“Before filing a motion to strike pursuant to
this chapter, the moving party shall meet and confer in person, by telephone,
or by video conference with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to
the motion to strike for the purpose of determining if an agreement can be
reached that resolves the objections to be raised in the motion to strike.”].) 
 
Second, a motion to strike may
not be brought with respect to matters outside the four corners of the pleading
or of judicially noticed facts. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437.) Defendant, however,
improperly moves to strike the Complaint based on their own statement of the
facts of the case. (Motion, pp. 3-7.) 
 
Finally, a motion to strike in a
court of limited jurisdiction may only be brought on the grounds that “the
damages or relief sought are not supported by the allegations of the complaint.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 92, subd. (d).) The instant Motion to Strike is based on
the grounds that the allegations are false or irrelevant, which is not
permitted in this limited jurisdiction court. (Motion, pp. 3-7.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Joseph Sguigna’s Motion for Striking Portions of Complaint
is DENIED. DEFENDANT IS TO FILE AND SERVE AN ANSWER TO THE COMPLAINT WITHIN 20
DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
