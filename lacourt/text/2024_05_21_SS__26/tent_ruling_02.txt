ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Emeka
V. Peter (“Plaintiff”), in pro per, filed the instant action for numerous
causes of action against Defendant Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (“Defendant”),
erroneously sued as Cedars Sinai Health Ventures, on December 21, 2022.
Following Defendant’s filing of a demurrer and motion to strike with respect to
the Complaint, Plaintiff filed the First Amended Complaint on February 28,
2023. Defendant filed a demurrer and motion to strike with respect to the First
Amended Complaint on April 20, 2023. The demurrer and motion to strike came for
hearing on July 7, 2023 but the unlimited jurisdiction court did not rule on
the motions. Instead, the case was transferred to the limited jurisdiction
court. (Minute Order, 07/07/23.) On January 23, 2024, the Court sustained the
demurrer with respect to all causes of action except negligence. (Minute Order,
01/23/24.) 
 
Defendant filed the instant Motion to Compel Responses to
Request for Production of Documents, Set One, on April 23, 2024. No opposition
has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
Defendant propounded Request for Production of Documents,
Set One, Plaintiff on July 20, 2023. (Motion, Watson Decl., Exh. A.) Following
Plaintiff’s failure to respond and a meet and confer effort, Defendant re-sent
the discovery requests on January 17, 2024. (Id. at ¶¶5-6 and Exh. B.)
On February 21, 2024, Plaintiff requested a 30 day extension of the time to
respond, which Defendant granted. (Id. at ¶7 and Exh. B.) As of the
filing of these Motions, no responses have been served. (Id. ¶8.) 
 
Based on Plaintiff’s failure to serve initial responses to
the discovery, the Motion to Compel Responses to the Request for Production of
Documents, is granted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) There is no requirement
for a prior meet and confer effort before a motion to compel initial responses
can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) Furthermore, the motion can be
brought any time after the responding party fails to provide the responses.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) Therefore, Defendant is entitled to an order
compelling Plaintiff to serve verified responses to the Request for Production
of Documents, Set One, without objections.
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Cedars-Sinai Medical Center’s Motion to Compel
Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, is GRANTED.
PLAINTIFF EMEKA V. PETER IS TO SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES WITHOUT OBJECTION TO
THE REQUESTS WITHIN 20 DAYS’ NOTICE OF THIS ORDER.
