The MSJ is granted on all three causes of action under the Song-Beverly Act (SBA), as the vehicle was sold used. However, the court grants Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to File a First Amended Complaint (FAC) in part, allowing an amended complaint to be filed under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act. The amended complaint will reflect a single cause of action for violation of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act.
