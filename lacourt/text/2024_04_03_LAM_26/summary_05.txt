And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is denying the defendant's motion to bifurcate the trial. The defendant, Geoffrey H. Palmer, seeks to bifurcate the trial into two phases: Phase One, a bench trial to determine the issue of duty, and Phase Two, a jury trial on the remaining issues. The defendant argues that bifurcation is necessary to avoid wasting time and money on the trial of damages issues if the liability issue is resolved against the plaintiff. The plaintiff, Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard & Smith LLP, opposes the motion, arguing that the issue of duty has already been determined in a previous summary adjudication motion. The judge finds that the issue of duty has not been determined and must still be resolved at trial. The judge also finds that the defendant has failed to show that bifurcation would promote the convenience of witnesses, ends of justice, or economy and efficiency of handling the litigation. The motion is denied.
