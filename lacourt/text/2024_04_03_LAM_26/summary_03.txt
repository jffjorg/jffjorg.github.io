And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment. The request is continued to May 8, 2024, due to several issues with the plaintiff's submissions. Firstly, the plaintiff's request for principal damages in the amount of $399,473 is not supported by evidence, and the plaintiff has failed to provide proof of the damages. Secondly, the plaintiff's interest declaration is inadequate, as it does not provide the rate of interest, the basis for the rate of interest, the period of interest accrual, and the calculation of interest. The contract specifies a 10% interest rate, and the plaintiff's 15% interest rate is not supported. Finally, the plaintiff has failed to establish the basis for liability and damages against the defendant.
