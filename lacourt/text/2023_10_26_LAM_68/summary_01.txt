Summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion for bifurcation of the trial and limiting discovery. The motion was made to determine the shareholder status of the defendant in the restaurant corporation B&K. The judge finds that bifurcation is necessary to streamline the litigation and to avoid prejudice to the parties. The judge also finds that limiting discovery would not be practical or beneficial, as the same evidence would be relevant to both the shareholder status issue and the other claims in the lawsuit. The judge will schedule a trial in the near term to determine the shareholder status of the defendant.
