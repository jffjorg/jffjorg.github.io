Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a lemon law case involving a 2018 Chevrolet Bolt EV. The plaintiff, Garrett Matsunaga, leased the vehicle in 2018 and alleges that it was delivered with serious defects. The defendant, General Motors, LLC, demurred to the complaint on the grounds that the statute of limitations for fraud claims has run. The judge agrees that the statute of limitations has run and sustains the demurrer to the First, Second, and Third Causes of Action with leave to amend.

The judge also finds that the complaint does not plead the fraud causes of action with sufficient specificity and sustains the demurrer to these causes of action with leave to amend. Additionally, the judge grants the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's request for punitive damages with leave to amend.

The judge gives the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint and orders that the case proceed accordingly.
