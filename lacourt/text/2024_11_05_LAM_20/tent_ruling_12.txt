On October 21, 2024, Plaintiff Jason Alan filed the operative Second Amended Complaint against Logix Federal Credit Union.  Plaintiff alleges that Defendant breached a settlement from case no. 23STLC03519.Defendant argues that the settlement from 23STLC03519 bars this lawsuit because Plaintiff failed to provide proper notice prior to filing suit.  Defendant now requests that the Court enforce the settlement by dismissing this action.The Court is authorized to enter judgment pursuant to a stipulated settlement.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 664.6.)  In reviewing a motion to enforce a settlement, the Court determines “whether the parties entered into a valid and binding settlement.”  (Hines v. Lukes (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1174, 1182.)  “A settlement is enforceable under section 664.6 only if the parties agreed to all material settlement terms.  [Citations.]  The court ruling on the motion may consider the parties’ declarations and other evidence in deciding what terms the parties agreed to, and the court’s factual findings in this regard are reviewed under the substantial evidence standard.  [Citations.]  If the court determines that the parties entered into an enforceable settlement, it should grant the motion and enter a formal judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.”  (Id. at pp. 1182-1183; see also Osumi v. Sutton (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 1355, 1357 [“Strong public policy in favor of the settlement of civil cases gives the trial court, which approves the settlement, the power to enforce it”].)The Motion is improper because this Court cannot enter the settlement from 23STLC03519 as a judgment in this case per CCP § 664.6.  The Court also cannot enter judgment in 23STLC03519.  Rather, Defendant can assert the settlement as a defense in this suit.  A motion to enforce settlement under CCP § 664.6 is a summary procedure intended for the case in which the settlement was reached.  Indeed, “The CCP § 664.6 summary procedure to obtain judgment can be utilized only where a settlement is reached in ‘pending litigation.’ It cannot be utilized to enforce a settlement reached before suit was filed.”  (Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial Ch. 12(II)-G.)Therefore, the Motion is denied. Moving party to give notice.
