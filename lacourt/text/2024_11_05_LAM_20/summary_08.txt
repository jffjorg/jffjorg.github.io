The Judge has denied the Defendant's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication on all claims. The Judge found that there are triable issues on all claims, including breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, conversion, quantum meruit, and unjust enrichment. The Judge noted that the Plaintiff contends that the Defendant intentionally sought to compel the Plaintiff to withdraw as counsel after negotiating a short-form settlement, and that the Defendant intentionally lied about her availability to the court. The Judge will not give judgment for the Defendant at this time, and the case will proceed to trial.
