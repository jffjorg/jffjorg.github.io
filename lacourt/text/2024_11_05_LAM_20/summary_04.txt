And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in response to the plaintiffs' motion to hold the defendants in contempt and impose sanctions for failing to provide responses to interrogatories and requests for production of documents (RPDs). The plaintiffs had been granted a motion to compel in March 2023, requiring the defendants to provide responses within 20 days. Despite this, the defendants never provided the required responses. The defense counsel claims that his family's medical issues since December 2023 prevented him from providing the responses, but the judge finds this explanation unsatisfactory, as the defense counsel could have provided responses earlier. The judge declines to hold the defendants in contempt but will award reduced monetary sanctions of $1,500. The judge also denies the plaintiffs' request for issue and evidentiary sanctions, as these are meant to be non-punitive and the defense counsel has agreed to provide responses. The judge orders the defendants to provide the required responses within 30 days.
