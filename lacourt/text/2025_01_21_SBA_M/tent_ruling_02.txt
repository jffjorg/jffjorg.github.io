1.      Patricia
Munoz’s Motion for Order Deeming Admitted Truth of Facts and Request for
Monetary Sanctions 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            Patricia
Munoz’s Motion for Order Deeming Admitted Truth of Facts and Request for
Monetary Sanctions is granted.  
 
            Background
 
            Plaintiff
filed the Complaint on November 9, 2023. Plaintiff and Defendant were involved
in a motor vehicle accident. Plaintiff alleges the following cause of action:
1. Motor Vehicle; 2. General Negligence. 
 
Motion to
Deem Admitted
 
Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280
states:
“If a party to whom requests
for admission are directed fails to serve a timely response, the following
rules apply:
(a) The party to whom the
requests for admission are directed waives any objection to the requests,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied:
(1) The party has
subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections
2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230.
(2) The party's failure to
serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect.
(b) The requesting party may
move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any
matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).
(c) The court shall make
this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission
have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed
response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with
Section 2033.220. It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction
under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or
both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission
necessitated this motion.”
 
Plaintiff states that she
served upon Defendant Requests for Admissions, Set One, on May 10, 2024. (Decl.,
Eduardo Madrid, ¶¶ 3-12.) Plaintiff contends that unverified responses were
served on June 11, 2024. (Id.) Unverified responses are tantamount to no
responses at all. Appleton v. Superior
Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636. 
 
Defendant’s counsel states
that he has been unable to obtain verified responses because Defendant only
speaks Vietnamese and because Defendant’s counsel has lost contact with his
client. (Decl., Brian Leach, ¶¶ 3-10.)  Defendant’s
counsel also reiterates his belief that his client is entitled to a protective
order. The Court notes that Defendant’s motion for protective order was
previously denied. There is no dispute that no verified responses have been
served upon Plaintiff as of this date.
 
The fact that Defendant
speaks a different language than Defendant’s counsel is no excuse for not
providing verified responses. In addition, Defendant’s apparent non-cooperation
in this case is likewise no excuse for not providing verified responses, and,
in fact, even further supports Plaintiff’s need to obtain a court order to
ensure that Defendant complies with his discovery obligations.
 
Thus, the motion to deem
requests for admissions, set one, admitted is granted.
 
Sanctions
 
As noted above, sanctions
are mandatory. Sanctions are awarded in favor of Plaintiff and against
Defendant and Defendant’s counsel in the total sum of $1,460.00. This amount
was derived by utilizing the requested rate of $350/hour x 4 hours to appear
and prepare, plus $60 filing fee.  
 
Sanctions are payable within
30 days of this date. 
 
Plaintiff is ordered to give
notice of this ruling.
