And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the moving papers, oppositions, and replies filed by the parties in this case. The moving defendants, Vesta Housing Solutions, LLC and Bernards Bros. Inc., have filed a motion for a good faith settlement determination. The motion is denied.

The Court has found that the moving parties have not presented substantial evidence regarding their proportionate liability, Vela's damages, or their financial condition and available insurance coverage. The Court has also found that the settlement amount is not within the reasonable range permitted by the criterion of good faith.

The Court has applied the factors set forth in Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates (1985) 38 Cal.3d 488, including the proportionate liability of the parties, the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of settlement proceeds among the parties, and the financial considerations of the parties. The Court has also considered the evidence presented by the parties, including the expert declarations and other evidence.

The Court has determined that the settlement is not in good faith and has denied the motion for a good faith settlement determination. The moving parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling and to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within five days.
