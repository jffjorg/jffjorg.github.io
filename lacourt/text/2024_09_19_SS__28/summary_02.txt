And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion filed by defendants True Loyalty, Inc. and Rodrigo Vital, Jr. to compel the deposition of plaintiff Maria Ruiz Solano and to impose sanctions on the plaintiff. The defendants contend that the plaintiff failed to appear for three previously scheduled depositions and that the plaintiff did not serve a valid objection before the most recent deposition. However, the defendants acknowledge that they took the previous three depositions off calendar as a courtesy to the plaintiff's counsel and that they did not submit a meet and confer declaration or a declaration stating they contacted the plaintiff's counsel to inquire about the nonappearance.

The judge has denied the motion, finding that the defendants did not comply with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, which requires a motion to be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration and a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance. The judge has ordered the moving parties to give notice of this ruling and to file proof of service of this ruling with the court within five days.
