 Case Number:  23STCV05504    Hearing Date:   September 19, 2024    Dept:  28           Having considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules
as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
March 13, 2023, Plaintiffs Jose Luis Espinosa-Rodriguez and Daniel Espinosa, a
minor by and through his guardian ad litem Ma Luisa Huerta-Rangel, filed this
action against Defendants Kasey Williams and Does 1-25 for negligence. 
On
April 13, 2023, the Court appointed Ma Luisa Huerta-Rangel to serve as Plaintiff
Daniel Espinosa’s guardian ad litem. 
On August
20, 2024, Petitioner Ma Luisa Huerta-Rangel
(“Petitioner”) filed a petition to approve the compromise of minor Plaintiff Daniel Espinosa’s claims. The petition was set for
hearing on September 19, 2024. 
On
August 23, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a notice of settlement. 
PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
asks the Court to grant the petition to approve the compromise of the action of
minor Plaintiff Daniel Espinosa.

Gross

Total
medical expenses:                                           $37,978.05

Reductions:                                                              0

Amount
paid:                                                           $2,690.80
To
be paid/reimbursed from proceeds:                     $1,813.56              
Liens:                                                                       $1,813.56              
Attorney’s
fees:                                                        $3,579.20
Costs:                                                                      
 $607.24
Net
settlement amount:                                             $9,000.00
 A.   Medical expenses
 Section
12a(1) of the petition states that total medical expenses were $37,978.05.  Section 12a(3) states that none of this
amount was subject to reductions.  This
should mean that the full amount of medical expenses ($37,978.05) is to be paid
or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. 
However, Section 12a(4) of the petition states that only $1,813.56 is to be paid or reimbursed from
the settlement proceeds.  As a result,
$36,164.49 in medical expenses are unaccounted for. 
Section
12b(4) states that Medi-Cal paid $2,690.80 of the medical expenses and has
agreed to accept $1,813.56 in
reimbursement.  The difference between
these figures ($877.24) is a “reduction” that should be included in Section 12a(3). 
Subtracting
$877.24 from $36,164.49 still leaves $35,287.25 in medical expenses that are
unaccounted for.  The Court cannot approve a petition unless it shows
that all medical expenses that have not been waived or reduced will be paid or
reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. Here, the petition does not show that
the remaining medical expenses of $35,287.25 have been waived or reduced or
will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. 
B.   Section 10b 
In
Section 10b, Petitioner wrote that “Ma Luisa Huerta-Rangel” is the defendant who
is paying $15,000.00 to settle the case.  Ma Luisa
Herta-Rangel appears to be the petitioner, not a defendant. 
C.   Section 11 
Petitioner
has not filled out Section 11 by checking either 11a or 11b and providing any requested information. 
For the reasons stated above, the Court denies the petition. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice the petition to approve the compromise of minor
Plaintiff Daniel Espinosa’s action filed by Petitioner Ma Luisa Huerta-Rangel on
August 20, 2024. 
Petitioner
is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within
five days.
