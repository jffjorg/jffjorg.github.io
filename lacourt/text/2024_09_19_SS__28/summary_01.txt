As for the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case 21STCV06066, denying Hertz Vehicles LLC's motion to continue the trial and related dates. The motion was filed on August 14, 2024, and was set for hearing on September 19, 2024. Hertz Vehicles LLC seeks to continue the trial to obtain additional discovery, including an independent medical examination of the plaintiff and further responses to discovery requests. The Judge finds that Hertz Vehicles LLC has not demonstrated good cause for the continuance and that the motion does not comply with the requirements for a motion to reopen discovery. The Judge also notes that almost one year after the Court granted Hertz Vehicles LLC's request to continue the trial for eleven months, Hertz Vehicles LLC has not acted diligently to obtain the discovery it needs. Therefore, the Judge denies the motion and orders Hertz Vehicles LLC to give notice of this ruling and to file proof of service with the Court within five days.
