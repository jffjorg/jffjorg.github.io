And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the petition to approve the compromise of minor plaintiff Daniel Espinosa's claims. The petition was filed by Ma Luisa Huerta-Rangel, who is also the guardian ad litem for Daniel Espinosa. The petition proposes a settlement of $15,000.00, but the judge has concerns about the payment of medical expenses. The petition states that a total of $37,978.05 was spent on medical expenses, but only $1,813.56 is to be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. The judge notes that the petition does not account for $36,164.49 in medical expenses and that the remaining medical expenses of $35,287.25 are not waived or reduced. Therefore, the judge cannot approve the petition. The judge has ordered the petitioner to give notice of this ruling and to file proof of service of this ruling with the court within five days.
