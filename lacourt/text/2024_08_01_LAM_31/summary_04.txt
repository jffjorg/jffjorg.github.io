And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses the Defendant's arguments regarding the Third Cause of Action, which is based on additional factual allegations. The Judge notes that Plaintiff employs a "chain letter" or cumulative pleading practice, as well as a "shotgun" pleading practice, which are disfavored. The Judge cites Kelly v. General Telephone Co. and Sollberger v. Wachovia Securities, LLC to explain why these practices should be avoided, as they cause ambiguity and redundancy. The Judge also notes that Plaintiff seeks punitive damages in connection with the First and Third Causes of Action, which are based on contract claims. The Judge rules that punitive damages are not recoverable for contract claims, citing Section II(B)(1)-(2) of this ruling.
