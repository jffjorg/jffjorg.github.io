[1] Defendant raises the same
arguments with respect to the Third Cause of Action.  Because that cause of action is based upon
additional factual allegations, the court addresses it separately.


[2] The court makes the following
observations about the Complaint. 
Plaintiff employs a “chain letter” or cumulative pleading practice, as
well as a shotgun pleading practice. 
These practices are disfavored. 
In Kelly v. General Telephone Co. (1982) 136 Cal.App.3d 278, the
court defined a pleading practice that it termed “chain letter” or cumulative
pleading and explained that the practice should be avoided because it causes
ambiguity and creates redundancy.  “[The
p]laintiff employs in part a ‘chain letter’ or cumulative type of pleading.
That is, [the] plaintiff's cause of action for negligent infliction of
emotional distress, the second cause of action in the second amended complaint,
incorporates by reference the entire first cause of action. This type of
pleading should be avoided as it tends to cause ambiguity and creates
redundancy.” (Id. at p. 285.)
 
In Sollberger
v. Wachovia Securities, LLC (C.D. Cal. June 30, 2010, No. SACV 09–0766 AG)
2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66233 at *11–12, 2010 WL 2674456, the court defined a
related pleading practice that it termed “shotgun ” pleading and explained why
that practice should not be tolerated by trial courts. “Shotgun pleadings are
pleadings that overwhelm defendants with an unclear mass of allegations and
make it difficult or impossible for defendants to make informed responses to
the plaintiff's allegations. They are unacceptable.... The Court has recognized
that allowing shotgun pleadings would lead to many negative consequences. See
Mason v. County of Orange, 251 F.R.D. 562, 563–64 (C.D. Cal. 2008) (quoting
Anderson v. District Board of Trustees, 77 F.3d 364, 366–67 (11th
Cir.1996)) (‘[E]xperience teaches that, unless cases are pled clearly and
precisely, issues are not joined, discovery is not controlled, the trial
court's docket becomes unmanageable, the litigants suffer, and society loses
confidence in the court's ability to administer justice.’); see also Byrne
v. Nezhat, 261 F.3d 1075, 1130 (11th Cir. 2001) (‘Cases framed by shotgun
pleadings consume an inordinate amount of a court's time. As a result, justice
is delayed, if not denied, for litigants who are standing in the queue waiting
to be heard. Their impression of the court's ability to take care of its
business can hardly be favorable. As the public becomes aware of the harm
suffered by the victims of shotgun pleading, it, too, cannot help but lose
respect for the system.’)”  
 
 


[3] Plaintiff seeks punitive damages
in connection with her First Cause of Action for Breach of the Implied Warranty
of Habitability and Third Cause of Action for Breach of the Covenant of Quiet
Enjoyment.  These claims are based in
contract.  As discussed in Section II(B)(1)-(2)
of this ruling, punitive damages are not recoverable for contract claims.  Accordingly, the motion to strike punitive
damages from the First and Third Causes of Action is meritorious on this
separate ground.
