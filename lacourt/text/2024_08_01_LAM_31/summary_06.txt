And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling in a case involving a plaintiff and defendant, Ms. Lee. The plaintiff had previously dismissed other defendants, and Ms. Lee argues that the amended judgment should be vacated because she was never served with the summons and complaint. The judge finds that Ms. Lee's argument is unavailing, as a trial court has the authority to amend a judgment to add additional judgment debtors, and Ms. Lee was not involved in the creation of Christable Corp. or this litigation until now. The judge vacates the amended judgment on the grounds stated in the ruling. The plaintiff claims that he will suffer prejudice from the delay in prosecution and has incurred considerable expenses, but the judge does not find it appropriate to hold Ms. Lee liable given her lack of knowledge and involvement in the case.
