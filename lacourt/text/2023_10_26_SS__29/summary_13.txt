Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The Court has denied Defendant Mizanur Rahman's motion to continue the trial date and all trial-related dates. The motion was filed on September 21, 2023, and the trial is currently set for January 18, 2024. The Defendant claimed that he needed additional time to prepare for trial due to the recent substitution of counsel and the need for additional discovery. However, the Court found that the Defendant had not shown good cause for a continuance, as the substitution of counsel is not a basis for a continuance and the Defendant had not demonstrated any diligence in completing discovery. The Court also noted that the Defendant's desire for more time was not sufficient to justify a continuance.
