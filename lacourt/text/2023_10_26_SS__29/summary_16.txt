Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Plaintiff Luis Sanchez's motion to compel Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority's deposition and production of documents. The Plaintiff had requested the deposition of Defendant's person most qualified (PMQ) to testify on various topics related to the bus collision that occurred on December 21, 2021. Defendant had previously produced a 30-second video of the collision, but refused to designate a witness or produce documents as requested.

The court finds that Plaintiff has shown good cause for the requested documents and the deposition topics are properly formulated. The court also orders Defendant to produce a PMQ witness to testify on the topics in the deposition notice and to produce the documents requested in that notice.

In addition, the court grants Plaintiff's request for sanctions, awarding Plaintiff $2,320 in monetary sanctions. The court finds that Defendant's failure to designate a witness and produce documents was unjustified and orders Defendant and their counsel to pay the sanctions.
