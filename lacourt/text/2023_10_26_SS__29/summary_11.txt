And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting two motions to compel filed by the University of California (UC). The motions were filed on August 31, 2023, and seek to compel the plaintiff, Albert Knowles, to respond to discovery requests served by UC on June 21, 2023. The plaintiff has not responded to the discovery requests, and the judge has found that UC has met its burden to show that the plaintiff has failed to respond. As a result, the judge has granted the motions to compel and ordered the plaintiff to provide verified, code-compliant, written responses to UC's discovery requests within 30 days of the notice of this order.
