And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The City of Los Angeles has filed a motion to continue the trial in this case, which stems from an incident in which Alfred Hutchings, an employee of Innovative Terminal Services, was operating a forklift that became stuck in a pothole, causing an injury. The City of Los Angeles argues that a continuance is necessary so that it can have its summary judgment motion heard prior to trial. The judge finds that the City of Los Angeles has shown good cause for the continuance, as the summary judgment motion was filed within the timing parameters of the Code of Civil Procedure and the City of Los Angeles has a right to have its timely filed motion heard prior to trial. Therefore, the judge grants the City of Los Angeles' motion to continue the trial, resetting the trial date to late October 2024.
