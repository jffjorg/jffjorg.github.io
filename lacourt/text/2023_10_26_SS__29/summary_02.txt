And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's response to Form Interrogatories (Set One) is granted. The defendant also requested sanctions, which are granted in part. The plaintiff failed to respond to the interrogatories despite having been served on February 16, 2023. The court finds that the plaintiff's failure to respond waives all objections and grants the defendant's motion to compel. The court also awards sanctions in the amount of $525 against the plaintiff and their counsel, K & L Associates, for their failure to respond to the interrogatories. The plaintiff is ordered to provide a verified, code-compliant, written response to the interrogatories within 21 days of notice of this order.
