And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motion of Defendant Bell Canyon Association, Inc. to change venue from Los Angeles Superior Court to Ventura Superior Court. The Defendant argues that the convenience of witnesses and the ends of justice would be promoted by the change of venue, citing news reports and declarations from first responders. However, the Court finds that the Defendant has not met its burden of showing that the convenience of witnesses and the ends of justice would be promoted by the change of venue. The Court notes that the Defendant has not identified specific witnesses who will be called at trial or explained why they would be inconvenienced by having to appear in Los Angeles County. Additionally, the Court finds that the Defendant has not rebutted the point that Travis's medical providers are located in Los Angeles County, which would likely be substantially less convenient for them than a trial in Ventura. Therefore, the motion is DENIED.
