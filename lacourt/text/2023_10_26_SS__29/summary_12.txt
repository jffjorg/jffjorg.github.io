And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion to compel responses to requests for production and the motion for sanctions. The defendant failed to respond to the discovery requests, but finally served responses two days prior to the hearing. The court finds that the motion to compel initial responses is denied as moot, since the defendant has now responded. However, the request for sanctions is granted in part, as the filing of this motion was necessary to bring the defendant into compliance with his obligations under the Civil Discovery Act. The court awards sanctions in the amount of $760 to the plaintiff, which covers the reasonable expenses incurred by the plaintiff as a result of the defendant's failure to respond to the discovery requests.
