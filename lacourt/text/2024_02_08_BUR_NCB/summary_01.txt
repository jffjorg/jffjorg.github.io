And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Plaintiff's motion for leave to submit a tardy expert witness list is denied. The Plaintiff, Health Pro Pharmaceutical Consulting and Management, Corp., D/B/A Bellaire Pharmacy, alleges that the Defendants, Lusine Mardyan and others, conspired to take their patients and engaged in fraud and deceit. The Plaintiff claims that they failed to submit an expert witness list due to mistake and excusable neglect, but the Judge finds that the Plaintiff's counsel, Mr. Aleksanian, did not make a satisfactory showing of mistake or negligence. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff's delay in submitting the expert witness list would prejudice the Defendants, who would have to expend more expenses and possibly retain experts in response to the Plaintiff's experts. Therefore, the motion is denied and the jury trial is scheduled to proceed as planned on February 20, 2024.
