Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to continue the trial date without prejudice. The defendants had requested a continuance to allow them to file their motion for summary judgment, which is currently reserved for December 10, 2024. The judge found that the defendants had failed to provide sufficient justification for the continuance, as they had not filed a motion for summary judgment and had not specified what necessary discovery remained to be completed. The judge noted that a trial court cannot refuse to hear a summary adjudication motion filed within the time limits of CCP ยง 437c. The judge encouraged the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and specified the procedures for submitting to the tentative ruling.
