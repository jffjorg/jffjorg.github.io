And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies without prejudice a motion by counsel, Nathan Samooha, to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff Jayden Reyes. The motion cites a breakdown in communication and the inability to confirm the plaintiff's address. The court notes that counsel attempted to serve the moving papers on the Clerk of the Court, but the service was rejected due to improper format. The court orders the moving party to give notice and encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement. The parties are advised to submit their intentions to the court by email or appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
