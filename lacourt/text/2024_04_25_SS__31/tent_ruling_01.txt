BACKGROUND FACTS Plaintiff Ron A. Rosen Jonfaza (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against defendants 1875/1925 Century Park East Company, et al. for damages related to premises liability.    On March 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed proof of service of the summons and complaint on defendant Pocrass & De Los Reyes, LLP (“P&D”), alleging P&D was personally served via its authorized agent for service of process James Pocrass (“Pocrass”) on May 7, 2022, at the address 1880 Century Park East, Suite 1415, Los Angeles, California 90067.  On March 15, 2023, Plaintiff also filed proofs of service of the summons and complaint on defendants Pocrass and Michael Devore (“Devore”), alleging these individuals were personally served on March 7, 2022 at 1880 Century Park East, Suite 1415, Los Angeles, California 90067. On December 8, 2023, Plaintiff filed proof of service of the summons and complaint on defendant P&D, alleging P&D was served through its authorized agent for service of process Pocrass via substituted service on “YARA ZOHDY (Office Manager – Authorized to accept service of process)” (“Zohdy”) on November 30, 2023, at the address 10474 Santa Monica Boulevard, Suite 402, Los Angeles, California 90025. Plaintiff filed another proof of service that P&D was served through Pocrass via substituted service with “ELLEN POCRASS (Defendant’s Wife – Authorized to accept service of process)” (“Mrs. Pocrass”) on November 30, 2023 at the address 472 Hillgreen Drive, Beverly Hills, California 90212.  On December 8, 2023, Plaintiff filed proofs of service alleging Pocrass was served via substituted service via Zohdy on November 30, 2023, and that Procrass was served via substituted service with Mrs. Pocrass on November 30, 2023. On December 8, 2023, Plaintiff filed proof of service that Devore was served via substituted service via Zohdy on November 30, 2023.  On February 9, 2024, P&D, Pocrass, and Devore (collectively, “Defendants”) filed the instant motion to quash service of the summons and complaint served allegedly served on them on November 30, 2023.  Plaintiff opposes the motion, and Defendants filed a reply.   II. REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE Defendants request the Court take judicial notice of the proofs of service filed on December 8, 2023 as to P&D, Pocrass, and Devore.  The requests are GRANTED. (Evid. Code § 452(d).)  III. MOTION TO QUASH SERVICE OF SUMMONS Legal Standard “[C]ompliance with the statutory procedures for service of process is essential to establish personal jurisdiction. [Citation.]” (Dill v. Berquist Construction Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1444.)  When a defendant challenges the court’s personal jurisdiction on the ground of improper service of process, the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the existence of jurisdiction by proving the facts requisite to an effective service. (Summers v. McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403, 413.) “The filing of a proof of service creates a rebuttable presumption that the service was proper. However, the presumption arises only if the proof of service complies with the applicable statutory requirements.” (Floveyor Internat., Ltd. v. Superior Court (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 789, 790.) “ ‘On a motion to quash service of summons, the plaintiff bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that all jurisdictional criteria are met. [Citations.] The burden must be met by competent evidence in affidavits and authenticated documents; an unverified complaint may not be considered as supplying the necessary facts.’ [Citation.]”  (Brown v. Garcia (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 1198, 1203; see also Sheard v. Superior Court (1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 207, 211 [“[W]here a defendant properly moves to quash service of summons the burden is on the plaintiff to prove facts requisite to the effective service.”].)   Discussion Defendants contend service upon them was not proper, because Zohdy was not authorized to accept service on behalf of P&D, and Plaintiff’s process server did not inform Zohdy of the contents of the package. Defendants further contend that service on Mrs. Pocrass was not proper because she was not informed of the general nature of the papers and that she was not authorized to accept service on behalf of P&D. Defendants submit the declaration of Zohdy, who declares that on November 30, 2023, someone came into P&D claiming to drop off a “gift” for Pocrass. (Decl. Zohdy, ¶ 3.) The “gift” was a tightly sealed GLS envelope, and the person did not mention anything about service. (Ibid.) After Zohdy signed for the “gift,” the person grabbed the signed document out of her hands and ran out of the office. (Ibid.) Zohdy then opened the package and saw it was service of the summons and complaint for P&D, Pocrass, and Devore. (Ibid.) Defendants also submit the declaration of Mrs. Pocrass, who declares that she is the wife of James Pocrass. (Decl. Ellen, ¶ 1.) She declares that someone came to her home trying to convince her to open the door to receive a bottle of wine. (Id. at ¶ 3.) Mrs. Pocrass declares she was unaware what she was signing for, and later she opened the documents and saw it was the service of the summons and complaint on behalf of P&D and Pocrass. (Ibid.). On December 3, 2023, a process server banged on her door at 10:00 p.m. claiming he was attempting to serve something, and when she did not open the door, the process server claimed he fell in front of her house and was injured. (Id. at ¶ 6.) Police were called because he would not stop screaming or leave, and police escorted the process server off the property. (Ibid.) Here, Defendants have rebutted the presumption that service was proper. The burden is therefore on Plaintiff to establish that service of the summons and complaint was proper. (Summers v. McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403, 413.)  The burden must be met by competent evidence in affidavits and authenticated documents; an unverified complaint may not be considered as supplying the necessary facts.’ [Citation.]” (Brown v. Garcia (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 1198, 1203; see also Sheard v. Superior Court (1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 207, 211 [“[W]here a defendant properly moves to quash service of summons the burden is on the plaintiff to prove facts requisite to the effective service.”].)   In opposition, Plaintiff contends that Defendants submit false and fraudulent declarations to quash service, and that Defendants are engaged in gamesmanship of evading service. Plaintiff argues Defendants have been properly served at both their personal and business addresses at 1880 Century Park East, Suite 1415, Los Angeles, California 90067 (old law office), 10474 Santa Monica Boulevard, Suite 402, Los Angeles, California 90025 (new law office), and 472 Hillgreen Drive, Beverly Hills, California 90212 (home address). Plaintiff submits the declaration of process server James Baird (“Baird”), who declares that he did several stakeouts on Defendants in order to serve them. (Baird Decl. ¶ 5.) Baird declares that he announced he was a processer server when he served Zohdy, and did advise Zohdy of the general natures of the papers, specifying that he was serving the summons and complaints. (Id. at ¶ 9.) Baird declares Zohdy informed him she was the office manager of the law firm P&D and authorized to accept service on its behalf. (Ibid.) A copy of the documents were mailed by first-class mail postage on Zohdy on November 30, 2023. (Ibid.) Baird further declares that he had announced himself as a process server when he served Mrs. Pocrass, and that he advised her of the nature of the papers. (Id. at ¶ 11.) Mrs. Pocrass stated she was the wife of Pocrass, and authorized to accept service on his behalf, but that she was not authorized to accept service of process for Devore, who is her son-in-law, and did not live at the Hillgreen Drive address. (Ibid.) Baird thereafter mailed by first class mail postage prepaid the copies of all documents he had served on November 30, 2023.  Regarding substitute service on a party, CCP § 415.20(b) provides:   “If a copy of the summons and complaint cannot with reasonable diligence be personally delivered to the person to be served, as specified in Section 416.60, 416.70, 416.80, or 416.90, a summons may be served by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint at the person's dwelling house, usual place of abode, usual place of business, or usual mailing address other than a United States Postal Service post office box, in the presence of a competent member of the household or a person apparently in charge of his or her office, place of business, or usual mailing address other than a United States Postal Service post office box, at least 18 years of age, who shall be informed of the contents thereof, and by thereafter mailing a copy of the summons and of the complaint by first-class mail, postage prepaid to the person to be served at the place where a copy of the summons and complaint were left.” Here, Plaintiff has established that service of Pocrass via his Mrs. Pocrass at his residence was proper, and provides sufficient evidence by way of the affidavit of process server Baird. Further, in terms of service of the summons and complaint on P&D, “The term ‘usual place of business’ includes a defendant's customary place of employment as well as his own business enterprise.”  (CCP § 415.20(b), Judicial Council Comment.) P&D does not deny that 10474 Santa Monica Boulevard, Suite 402, Los Angeles is its law firm address, or that Zohdy was its front desk manager. Plaintiff has sufficiently demonstrated that P&D was served at its “usual place of business” within the meaning of CCP § 415.20(b).  The process statutes should be liberally construed to effectuate service and uphold the jurisdiction of the court if actual notice has been received by the defendant, and in the last analysis the question of service should be resolved by considering each situation from a practical standpoint. (See Espindola v. Nunez (1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 1389; Ellard v. Conway (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 540, 544-45.)  The evident purpose of CCP § 415.20 is to permit service to be completed upon a good faith attempt at physical service on a responsible person, plus actual notification of the action by mailing the summons and complaint to the appropriate party. (Khourie, Crew & Jaeger v. Sabek, Inc. (1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 1009.) One benefit of the liberal construction rule is its tendency to eliminate unnecessary, time-consuming, and costly disputes over service of process issues. (Summers v. McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403, 415.)    The California Supreme Court reaffirmed the liberal construction of California’s jurisdiction and service of process statutes, in which the salient factors are “if actual notice has been received by the defendant” then “the question of service should be resolved by considering each situation from a practical standpoint.” (Pasadena Medi-Ctr. Assocs. v. Superior Ct. (1973) 9 Cal. 3d 773, 778.) From a practical standpoint, how else is Plaintiff to serve P&D if not directly at P&D itself? The same could be said about service on Pocrass at his residence, and subservice through his wife if he is continuously not present at his home address to personally receive service of the summons and complaint. The competing declarations cast doubt upon the veracity of each of the parties’ affidavits. However, neither Pocrass nor P&D can deny they have actual notice of this action. Baird’s declaration providing that Zohdy informed him that she was authorized to accept service creates ostensible authority, and ostensible authority to accept service is sufficient to impose personal jurisdiction over P&D. (Pasadena Medi-Ctr. Assocs., supra, 9 Cal. 3d at 778.) Further, although Baird’s declaration does not address Mrs. Pocrass’ declaration that she was tricked into service, neither does Mrs. Pocrass provide any proof substantiating the narrative event from her perspective. Having reviewed the evidence presented, and under the policy of liberal construction when the defendant has actual notice and considering service from a practical standpoint, the Court is persuaded that service was proper under CCP § 415.20 as to P&D and Pocrass. The motion to quash is therefore denied as to P&D and Pocrass. However, Plaintiff has not submitted any evidence supporting proper service on Devore. It is undisputed that Devore, as the purported son-in-law of Pocrass, does not reside at 472 Hillgreen Drive, Beverly Hills, California 90212. Further, Plaintiff has submitted no evidence connecting Devore to the P&D law firm at 10474 Santa Monica Boulevard, Suite 402, Los Angeles or that office manager Zohdy was authorized to accept service on behalf his behalf. Therefore, the motion to quash as to Devore is granted.   IV. CONCLUSION Defendants’ motion to quash is GRANTED IN PART: Devore’s motion to quash service of summons and complaint is GRANTED.  P&D and Pocrass’ motion to quash service of the summons and complaint is DENIED. P&D and Pocrass are ordered to file their responsive pleading within 20 days.   Moving party is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿ Dated this 24th day of April 2024     Hon.
