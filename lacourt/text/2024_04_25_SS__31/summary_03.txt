And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court grants defendant Eureka Realty Partners, Inc.'s unopposed motions to compel discovery responses from plaintiff Nolvia Varela. The defendant served discovery requests on the plaintiff on November 16, 2023, and the plaintiff failed to respond to the requests. As a result, the defendant moved the court for an order compelling the plaintiff to provide responses to the outstanding discovery. The court finds that the plaintiff's failure to respond to the discovery requests is unreasonable, and accordingly, grants the defendant's motion to compel responses. The court orders the plaintiff to serve verified responses to the defendant's first supplemental interrogatory and first supplemental request for production of documents without objections within 20 days.
