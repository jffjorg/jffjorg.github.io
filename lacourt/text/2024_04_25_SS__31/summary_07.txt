Here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer to the Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint (FAC) is sustained without leave to amend. The Plaintiffs' claims against the defendants, including Lebleuchateau dba Burbank Senior Villa West, Burbank Senior Villa West, Trion Solutions Inc., Kornland Building, and Paul Lawrence Dunbar Haney IV, are barred by the workers' compensation exclusive remedy rule. The judge finds no positive misconduct by the defendants to exempt them from the exclusivity rule. The judge concludes that the defendants' failure to report the threatening text message and the subsequent murder of Decedent by Haney falls within the statutory scheme contemplated by the Workers Compensation Act, and therefore, Plaintiffs' sole remedy is under the workers' compensation scheme.
