Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint (SAC). The SAC aims to clarify the statutory basis for the plaintiff's first cause of action against Loyola Marymount University. The motion was made in accordance with California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324, which requires a supporting declaration and specifies the effect, necessity, and propriety of the amendments. The defendant, Loyola Marymount University, did not oppose the motion. The judge found that the plaintiff's motion met the requirements of Rule 3.1324 and that no opposition was filed, thus granting the motion. The judge ordered that the defendants' existing answer to the First Amended Complaint shall stand as to the SAC.
