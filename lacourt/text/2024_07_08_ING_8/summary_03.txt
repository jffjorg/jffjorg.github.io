And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling is to grant the Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment filed by Defendant, Pieces, LP, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5. The Court finds that the Defendant was not served actual notice of the lawsuit, as the service by posting at the subject property, which is a summer vacation home and not the Defendant's regular residence, was improper. The Court notes that the Defendant is a limited partnership with a registered agent for service, and that the Plaintiff failed to seek service through the Secretary of State as one would in a situation where a party had failed to designate a registered agent. The Court's ruling is based on the strong public policy favoring resolution of cases on their merits.
