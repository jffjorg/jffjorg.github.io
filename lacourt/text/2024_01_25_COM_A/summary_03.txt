Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion to enforce the settlement agreement and for costs and fees. The plaintiff seeks to enforce a settlement agreement between the parties, which requires the defendant to pay the plaintiff $150,000 and the plaintiff to withdraw the notice of pendency of action. The defendant has not satisfied its obligations under the settlement agreement and has requested a continuance and reimbursement of attorney fees and costs. The judge finds that the plaintiff's motion is granted and that the court enters judgment pursuant to the terms of the parties' settlement agreement. The court awards the plaintiff attorney's fees of $1,125.00 and costs of $60.00, payable by the defendant within 10 days.
