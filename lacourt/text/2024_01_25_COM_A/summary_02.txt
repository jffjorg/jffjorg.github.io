And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, granting their motion to compel further responses to their request for production of documents. The judge finds that General Motors, LLC's responses to the request were evasive and non-responsive, and that the company failed to respond in good faith to the plaintiffs' requests for meet and confer. The judge also finds that General Motors, LLC's objections to the discovery requests are not supported by evidence and are deemed evasive and non-responsive.

The judge orders General Motors, LLC to serve a verified response and production of documents to the plaintiffs' requests within 10 days, and to comply with the statute in doing so. The judge also refuses to consider the now-five-year-old Declaration of Huizhen Lu, submitted in support of GM's contention that the discovery sought includes trade secret and confidential information.

The judge notes that the plaintiffs are entitled to discover "other vehicle" evidence, and that the discovery of internal investigations and analyses of the "Infotainment" and front bumper defects are relevant to establish General Motors, LLC's knowledge of the defects and whether it failed to comply with the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The judge also finds that the discovery is relevant to the recovery of civil penalties, and that General Motors, LLC has not established with any evidence that compliance with the document request will be unreasonably burdensome and oppressive.
