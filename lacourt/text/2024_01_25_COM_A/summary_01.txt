And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling continues the hearing on the plaintiff's request for default judgment against the defendant, Telops International, Inc. The plaintiff, Lawrence Chibueze, et al, alleges that the defendant, through its agent Julio Benavente, installed solar panels on their home without their consent. The plaintiff claims that Benavente forged their signatures on the installation agreement and financing contract, and that the defendant placed a lien of $84,000 on their home, which increased their mortgage and property taxes. The plaintiff filed a proof of service of Statement of Damages, but failed to provide proof of service of the Statement of Damages and Punitive Damages to the defendant, as required by statute. The court has previously continued the hearing to give the plaintiff an opportunity to perfect their request for default judgment. In this tentative ruling, the court sets an order to show cause re dismissal for failure to obtain default judgment by default for a further continuance.
