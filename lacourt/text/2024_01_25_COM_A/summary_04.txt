And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English:

The Judge has ruled on the demurrer filed by Diamond Construction & Waterproofing, which demurred to all claims alleged against it. The Judge has sustained the demurrer in part, finding that the complaint does not adequately allege fraud, fraudulent concealment, and negligent misrepresentation against Diamond. However, the Judge has overruled the demurrer as to the claims for professional negligence and unfair business practices.

The Judge found that the complaint does not adequately allege fraud, fraudulent concealment, and negligent misrepresentation against Diamond because the allegations do not meet the strict requirements of particularity in pleading. The Judge also found that the complaint does not allege facts that establish Diamond's intent and motivation to misrepresent the true condition of the property to the Plaintiffs.

The Judge has given the Plaintiffs leave to amend the complaint, but has not granted leave to amend as it is the Plaintiffs' burden to demonstrate how the defect can be cured and how the amendment will change the legal effect of the pleading.
