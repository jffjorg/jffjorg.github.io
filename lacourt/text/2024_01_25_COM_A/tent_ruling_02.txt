[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING
PLAINTIFFS’
 MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO PLAINTIFFS’ REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS,
 SET ONE
 
I.       
BACKGROUND
       The
complaint alleges that Defendant, General Motors, LLC (“Defendant”), issued a
written warranty to Plaintiffs with their purchase of a2021 Chevrolet Tahoe.
The vehicle developed defects that Defendant allegedly failed to repair or
repurchase in violation of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.
II.     
ARGUMENTS
       Plaintiffs
argue that Defendant’s responses to the document request were evasive,
non-responsive and contained boilerplate objections. Plaintiffs’ counsel attempted
to engage in numerous efforts to meet and confer with defense counsel, who
failed to respond in good faith. 
       Defendant
argues that Plaintiffs failed to meet and confer in good faith as Plaintiffs
did not provide any meaningful substantive reasoning or analysis. The
objections are well founded. Plaintiff does not need other vehicle information.
Defendant already produced documents sought by Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs seek
confidential material. 
       In
reply, Plaintiffs argue that Defendant has yet to provide documents responsive
to the request served in September 2023. 
III.   
LEGAL STANDARDS
       A
motion to compel further responses to a document request is proper where
Plaintiffs believe Defendant’s statement of compliance is incomplete, or a
representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive
and/or an objection in the response is without merit or too general.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.310.) The parties have met and conferred informally and
with the Court without resolution. 
       The
scope of discovery is liberally construed in favor of disclosure “as a matter
of right unless statutory or public policy considerations clearly prohibit it.”
(Greyhound
Corp. v. Superior Court of Merced County (1961) 56 Cal. 2d 355,
377-378.) The broad scope of permissible discovery includes “any matter, not
privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending
action or to the determination of any motion made in that action, if the matter
either is itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2017.010.)
IV.   
DISCUSSION
       This
matter is the 58th action for violation of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty
Act (“SBA”) filed in this Court against GM. This Court has heard 29 discovery
motions to date involving GM’s failure to respond to relevant and discoverable
requests for documents. As in every discovery motion brought by a plaintiff, GM
opposes on the virtually the same grounds: Plaintiffs failed to meet and confer
in good faith, the discovery involves irrelevant topics that include vehicles
other than Plaintiffs’ (“other vehicle evidence”), the documents are subject to
numerous privileges, and/or compliance is unduly burdensome and oppressive. 
       The
Court has previously articulated its position on these same issues in multiple
motions raised in the following cases involving GM:

       In
this case, Defense counsel failed to respond in good faith to Plaintiffs’
request to meet and confer especially in light of the 29 discovery motions
heard by this Court on the same if not identical issues wherein the Court
rejected GM’s objections concerning the relevance and discoverability of
information sought by Plaintiffs.  Here,
Plaintiffs requests Defendant’s internal investigations and
analyses of the “Infotainment” and front bumper defects. (Requests 16-21, 59-64.)
       Contrary
to Defendant’s argument, Plaintiffs sent detailed letters concerning
Plaintiffs’ issues with Defendant’s objections on October 31, 2023, and
November 7, 2023. (Fennell Decl., Ex. 11, 12). Plaintiffs agreed to sign
Defendant’s protective order. Defendant twice responded with letters standing
by its objections and “maintaining its position.” (Fennell Decl., Exs. 13, 14.)
Plaintiffs sent a third letter, fourth letter, and fifth letter to meet and
confer indicating how Defendant’s responses were deficient. (Fennell Decl., Ex.
15.) Defendant responded on the latter three occasions that it stood by its
objections, that its responses were code compliant, and otherwise refused to
produce any information. (Fennel Decl.,  Ex. 16-19.) 

       GM’S
opposition again offers no substantive or persuasive argument for failing to
produce documents. The Court has previously determined that internal
investigation documents fall within the broad scope of discovery in lemon law
cases. The Court has conducted informal discovery conferences on other matters
with GM’s counsel (Erskine Law Firm) explaining why the discovery is
permissible. 
       The
Court has previously refused to consider the now-five-year-old Declaration of
Huizhen Lu, Defendant’s Senior Technical Consultant, submitted in support of
GM’s contention that the discovery sought includes trade secret and
confidential information. (Declaration, Xylon Quezada, Ex. A.) GM provides a copy
of the same declaration signed on October 25, 2018, that contains generalized
statements about purported trade secret and confidential information which
“may” be contained in the requested discovery. This contention is vague, evasive,
and speculative. The declaration predates the filing of this action and the
date of manufacture of the vehicle at issue. Defendant’s confidentiality objections
are not substantiated. 
       Moreover,
where Defendant objects to testimony concerning confidentiality, trade secret,
attorney-client privilege, work product, or any other privilege, Defendant is
required to provide a privilege log of all documents withheld and the specific
objection asserted to enable the Court to determine whether any privilege
applies. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.240 subp. (b).) The privilege log must
contain clear descriptions of the documents as set forth in the statute. (Id.)

       Plaintiffs
are entitled to discover “other vehicle” evidence. (Donlen
v. Ford Motor Co. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 138, 154.) The requests are
relevant to Plaintiffs’ burden of establishing Defendant’s non-compliance with
its obligations under the Act to reasonably attempt to repair vehicle of the
same make and model with respect to the defects at issue. (Oregel
v. American Isuzu Motors, Inc. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.) 
       The
discovery of internal investigations and analyses of the “Infotainment” and
front bumper defects are also relevant to establish Defendant’s knowledge of
the defects and whether it failed to comply with the Act. The discovery
is also relevant to the recovery of civil penalties. (Jensen
v. BMW of North America, Inc. (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 112, 136.)
To recover civil penalties, the buyer must show that “the manufacturer's
failure to comply was willful. The penalty is important ‘as a deterrent to
deliberate violations. Without such a provision, a seller or manufacturer who
knew the consumer was entitled to a refund or replacement might nevertheless be
tempted to refuse compliance in the hope the consumer would not persist, secure
in the knowledge its liability was limited to refund or replacement.’” (Jensen
v. BMW of North America, Inc. (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 112, 136.)
To establish this violation, the jury can
consider whether “(1) the manufacturer knew the vehicle had not been repaired
within a reasonable period or after a reasonable number of attempts, and (2)
whether the manufacturer had a written policy on the requirement to repair or
replace. (Jensen at 136.) Accordingly, the internal analysis and
investigative documents are relevant and discoverable. 
       Defendant
has not established with any evidence that compliance with the document request
will be unreasonably burdensome and oppressive. Defendant’s remedy
is to move for a protective order, not refuse to respond or unilaterally impose
limitations on Plaintiffs’ discovery. Defendant did not meet its burden of
proof on this issue. (West
Pico Furniture Co. v. Superior Court (1961) 56 Cal.2d 407, 417.) 
       To the
extent Defendant refers Plaintiffs to documents previously produced, the
response is improper. Plaintiffs are entitled to a complete response in the
form required by statute. It is not proper to answer, “by stating, ‘see my
deposition,’ ‘see my pleading,’ or ‘see the financial statement.’ Indeed, if a
question does require the responding party to make reference to a pleading or
document, the pleading or document should be identified and summarized so the
answer is fully responsive to the question.” (Deyo v. Kilbourne,
(1978) 84 Cal. App. 3d 771, 783-784.) 
       Defendant
cannot simply object to the production of electronically stored information
based on “undue burden or expense.” Rather, "the responding party shall
identify in its response the types or categories of sources of electronically
stored information that it asserts are not reasonably accessible. By objecting
and identifying information of a type or category of source or sources that are
not reasonably accessible, the responding party preserves any objections it may
have relating to that electronically stored information." (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.210.)
       In
anticipation of GM’s request for more than 10 days to comply because it is
overburdened by the number of lemon law cases it must defend and the discovery
propounded, the request is denied. Plaintiff served the document request on
September 29, 2023, and has not received any valid response. (Fennell Decl., ¶
15.) Defendants spent nearly five months refusing to produce documents knowing
GM’s familiar objections to the same discovery were not well taken by this
Court on at least 29 occasions. Defense counsel’s inability to accommodate its
case load is not an issue for the Court to resolve, especially where the claim
of “undue burden” is not supported by any evidence. 
V.   CONCLUSION
       Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiffs’ motion is GRANTED.        Defendant is ordered to serve within 10 days, further,
verified responses and production of documents to Requests 16-21,
59-64, without objection and in a form that complies with statute within
10 days. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.210, et seq.) As Plaintiffs did not request imposition
of sanctions, none is awarded.
