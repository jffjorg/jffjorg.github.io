And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a landlord-tenant dispute over habitability issues at an apartment complex in Long Beach, California. The plaintiffs, the tenants, allege that the defendants, Leafy Properties, LLC, Craig Hsu, and Karen Lee Hsu, failed to maintain the property in a habitable condition, resulting in various safety and health hazards. The defendants demurred to the plaintiffs' complaint, arguing that it fails to state a claim against them. The judge has sustained the demurrer as to the first through fifth causes of action, but has given the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint. The judge has also denied the defendants' motion to strike the plaintiffs' request for punitive damages, finding that the complaint contains sufficient factual support for the allegations of malicious conduct. The judge has ordered the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint by November 13, 2023.
