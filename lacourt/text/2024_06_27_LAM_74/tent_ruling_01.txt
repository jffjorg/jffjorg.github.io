  Case Number:  22STCV22815    Hearing Date:   June 27, 2024    Dept:  74 Richard
Lopez v. Rafael David Miranda, et al. 
Defendant Rafael David Miranda’s
Motion for Summary JudgmentDefendant filed his motion for summary judgment on November
16, 2023, but did not at that time file the documents that properly accompany a
motion for summary judgment, such as a separate statement supported by
evidence. The hearing was set for June 27, 2024. Based on a June 27 hearing
date, Defendant was obligated to file and serve his complete
motion no later than April 12, 2024. On May 13, 2024, and May 16,
2024, Defendant filed his amended separate statement and amended notice of
motion and motion for summary judgment, respectively. On May 28, 2024, Defendant
filed his documents in support of his motion: declaration of Plaintiff;
compendium of exhibits; compendium of authorities; and request for judicial
notice. Defendant
did not comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 437c subdivision (a)(2)
because Defendant did not complete service of his motion for summary judgment
at least 75 days before the June 27, 2024 hearing. Accordingly, the court denies
Defendant’s motion because Defendant did not provide timely statutory notice
under section 437c subdivision (a)(2).
