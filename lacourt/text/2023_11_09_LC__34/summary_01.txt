And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge grants the motion to terminate and/or issue, evidence, and monetary sanctions filed by the Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant, Ari Chazanas, against the Defendant/Cross-Complainant, Vazgen Hakobian. The motion is granted because the Defendant/Cross-Complainant has failed to comply with the Court's discovery orders, including serving discovery responses, opposing motions to compel, and complying with the Court's Order dated June 24, 2022. The Court finds that the Defendant/Cross-Complainant has given up on the case and has chosen not to participate in the litigation. As a result, the Court strikes the Defendant/Cross-Complainant's Answer to the Complaint, dismisses with prejudice the Defendant/Cross-Complainant's Cross-Complaint, and denies the request for monetary sanctions to the Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant.
