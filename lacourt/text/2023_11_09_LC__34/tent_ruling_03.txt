Employment Form Interrogatories, and Specially Prepared Interrogatories, Sets
No. One [and] Request for Monetary Sanctions (“ROGs Motion”); (2) Motion to

ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
ROGs Motion
and RPDs Motion
 
A.      Legal Standard
 
California Code of Civil Procedure requires a response
from the party to whom form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and
demand requests are propounded within 30 days after service of the requests,
unless the time is extended by agreement of the parties. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.260, subd. (a), 2030.270, subd. (a), 2031.260, subd. (a), 2031.270, subd.
(a).) If a party fails to serve timely responses, "the party making the
demand may move for an order compelling response to the demand.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (b).) By failing to respond, the offending party
waives any objection to the demand. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)
 
For a motion to compel, all a propounding
party must show is that it properly served its discovery requests, that the
time to respond has expired, and that the party to whom the requests were
directed failed to provide a timely response. (See Leach v. Super. Ct.
(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905, 906.) Indeed, "[o]nce [a party] 'fail[ed]
to serve a timely response,' the trial court had authority to grant [opposing
party's] motion to compel responses." (Sinaiko Healthcare Counseling,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 405.)
 
The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel motions for
interrogatories or requests for production, unless the Court finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an
order compelling answers, the court may make those orders that are just,
including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In
lieu of or in addition to that sanction, the court may impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c).)
 
B.      Discussion
 
Plaintiff moves the Court to compel
Defendants to serve responses to the form interrogatories (“FROGs”), special
interrogatories (“SROGs”), and requests for production of documents (“RPDs”)
that Plaintiff propounded on July 25 and 26, 2023. (ROGs Motion, p. 10:13–16
and Exh. A, p. 8, Exh. C, p. 10; RPDs Motion, p. 11:6–9 and Exh. A, p. 17, Exh.
B, p. 12.) According to Plaintiff’s Counsel, Defendants have not responded to
these discovery requests. (ROGs Motion, Decl. LaCour, ¶¶ 8, 14–15; RPDs Motion,
Decl. LaCour, ¶¶ 10, 17.)
 
There is no evidence before the
Court that would indicate Defendants responded to these discovery requests. 
 
The Court GRANTS the ROGs Motion and the RPDs Motion. Defendants shall
provide initial responses to the ROGs and RPDs within 14 days of the issuance
of this Order.
 
C. 
    Sanctions
 
For each of these motions, Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions
against Defendants and Defense Counsel. 
 
Defendants failed to serve timely responses to the ROGs and RPDs. A
monetary sanction would normally be appropriate. 
 
However, for each of these two motions, Plaintiff’s Counsel requests
$2,500.00 based on a rate of $925.00, without any explanation for how many
hours were incurred or why such a high rate is reasonable. In any case, given
the boilerplate, repetitive motions filed, $2,500.00 is a patently unreasonable
sanction, much less $5,000.00. 
 
“If . . . the
Court were required to award a reasonable fee when an outrageously unreasonable
one has been asked for, claimants would be encouraged to make unreasonable
demands, knowing that the only unfavorable consequence of such misconduct would
be reduction of their fee to what they should have asked in the first place. To
discourage such greed, a severer reaction is needful.” (Serrano v. Unruh
(1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 635 [cleaned up].)¿
 
“A
fee request that appears unreasonably inflated is a special circumstance
permitting the trial court to reduce the award or deny one altogether.” (Chavez
v. City of Los Angeles (2010) 47 Cal.4th 970, 990; Ketchum v. Moses
(2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1137; Serrano, supra, 32 Cal.3d at
p. 635.) 
 
The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s request for sanctions. 
 
D. 
    Conclusion
 
The ROGs Motion and the RPDs Motion are GRANTED. Defendants shall
provide initial responses to the ROGs and RPDs within 14 days of the issuance
of this Order.
 
Plaintiff’s Request for Monetary Sanctions are DENIED. 
 
II.      
RFAs Motion
 
A. 
    Legal
Standard
 
California Code of Civil Procedure requires a
response from the party to whom the request for admissions is directed within
30 days after service of the request for admissions. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.250, subd. (a).)
 
If the party fails to serve a timely response,
“the party to whom the requests for admission are directed waives any objection
to the requests.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).)
 
The requesting party may then “move for an
order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters
specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for monetary sanction
under Chapter 7.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)
 
A court will deem requests admitted, “unless
it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed
has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the
requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.
It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
 
B.      Discussion
 
Plaintiff moves the Court to deem admitted the truth of the
matters specified in the Requests for Admission (“RFAs”) that Plaintiff
propounded on July 25, 2023. (RFAs Motion, p. 4:5–7 and Exh. A, p. 7.)
Plaintiff’s Counsel declares that no responses were served. (RFAs Motion, Decl.
LaCour, ¶¶ 6, 8, 15.)
 
There is no evidence before the Court that would indicate Defendants
responded to the RFAs. 
 
The Court GRANTS the RFAs Motion. The RFAs are DEEMED ADMITTED. 
 
C. 
    Sanctions
 
Plaintiff again requests monetary sanctions of $2,500.00 against
Defendants and Defense Counsel for this motion. 
 
        The purpose of monetary sanctions
is to reimburse the prevailing party for the time spent on preparing the discovery
motion.  Monetary sanctions
encourage “voluntary compliance with discovery procedures by assessing the
costs of compelling compliance against the defaulting party.” (Argaman v.
Ratan (1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 1173, 1179.) 

 
Defendants failed to serve timely responses to the RFAs. Thus, monetary
sanctions would normally be appropriate.  However, for the exact same reasons as with
the sanctions requested for the ROGs Motion and the RPDs Motion, monetary
sanctions are not appropriate here.  Further,
the Court seriously doubts that counsel spent exactly 2.7 hours – at $925/hour –
on each of these motions.
 
        The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s Request for
Monetary Sanctions. 
 
D. 
    Conclusion
 
The RFAs Motion is GRANTED. The RFAs are DEEMED ADMITTED. 
 
Plaintiff’s Request for Monetary Sanctions is DENIED.
