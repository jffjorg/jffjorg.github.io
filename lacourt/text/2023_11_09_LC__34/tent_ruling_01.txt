BACKGROUND:
 
On June 15,
2021, Plaintiff Ari Chazanas filed his Complaint against Defendant Vazgen
Hakobian (sued as Vazgen Hakopian) on causes of action of breach of contract,
fraud, negligence, restitution pursuant to Business and Professions Code
section 7031, and money had and received. 
 
On October
29, 2021, Defendant filed his Answer to the Complaint. 
 
On November
12, 2021, Defendant/Cross-Complainant Vazgen Hakobian filed his Verified
Cross-Complaint against Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Ari Chazanas and
Cross-Defendants Lotus West Properties, Inc., Demetra Chazanas, and Demetra
Design Corp.
 
On March 7,
2022, Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant and the other Cross-Defendants each filed their
respective Answer to the Verified Cross-Complaint. 
 
On June 24,
2022, the Court granted Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant’s motions to compel form
interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for admissions. Notably,
Defendant/Cross-Complainant did not respond to the discovery requests, and
Defendant/Cross-Complainant did not oppose the motions compelling responses to
the discovery requests. 
 
On July 17,
2023, the Court granted Defense Counsel’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel.
When granting Defense Counsel this relief, the Court noted that “[t]he risk of
prejudice to Defendant here is minimal. Trial has not been scheduled in this
matter, giving Defendant sufficient time to find new representation should he
so choose.” (Minute Order dated July 17, 2023, p. 4.)
 
On October
17, 2023, Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant filed his Motion for Terminating and/or
Issue, Evidence, and Monetary Sanctions for Failure to Comply with the Court’s
June 24, 2022 Order. In support of his Motion, Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant
concurrently filed: (1) Memorandum of Points and Authorities; (2) Declaration
of James Kawahito; and (3) Proposed Order. 
 
No opposition
or other response has been filed to the Motion. 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal
Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 gives
the court the discretion to impose sanctions against anyone engaging in a
misuse of the discovery process. A court may impose terminating sanctions by
striking pleadings of the party engaged in misuse of discovery or entering
default judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d).) A violation of a
discovery order is sufficient for the imposition of terminating sanctions. (Collison
& Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1620.) Terminating
sanctions are appropriate when a party persists in disobeying the court's
orders. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 795–796.)
 
A terminating sanction is a "drastic
measure which should be employed with caution." (Deyo, supra,
at p. 793.) 
 
"A decision to order terminating
sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful,
preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe
sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial
court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction." (Mileikowsky v.
Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279–280.)
 
While the court has discretion to impose
terminating sanctions, these sanctions "should be appropriate to the
dereliction and should not exceed that which is required to protect the
interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery." (Deyo, supra,
84 Cal.App.3d at p. 793.) "[A] court is empowered to apply the ultimate
sanction against a litigant who persists in the outright refusal to comply with
his discovery obligations." (Id.) Discovery sanctions are not to be
imposed for punishment, but instead are used to encourage fair disclosure of
discovery to prevent unfairness resulting for the lack of information. (See Midwife
v. Bernal (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 57, 64 [superseded on other grounds as
stated in Kohan v. Cohan (1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 967, 971.)
 
"A trial court has broad discretion to
impose discovery sanctions, but two facts are generally prerequisite to the
imposition of nonmonetary sanctions . . . (1) absent unusual circumstances,
there must be a failure to comply with a court order, and (2) the failure must
be willful." (Biles v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th
1315, 1327; but see Reedy v. Bussell (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 1272, 1291
["willfulness is no longer a requirement for the imposition of discovery
sanctions."].)
 
II.      
Discussion
 
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant moves the
Court to: (1) strike Defendant/Cross-Complainant’s Answer to the Complaint; (2)
dismiss with prejudice Defendant/Cross-Complainant’s Cross-Complaint; (3) in
the alternative, hold Defendant/Cross-Complainant in contempt of court and
prohibit him from participating in the proceedings until he is in full
compliance with the Court’s Minute Order dated June 24, 2022; and (4) sanction
Defendant/Cross-Complainant in the amount of $1,500.00 to the Court and
$5,600.00 to Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant. (Motion, pp. 9:27–28, 10:1–4.)
 
According to Counsel for
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant, Defendant/Cross-Complainant has not complied with
the Court’s Minute Order dated June 24, 2022, in that he has not served any of
the discovery responses or paid the amounts he was sanctioned. (Decl. Kawahito,
¶¶ 2, 4.)
 
        The Court
agrees with Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant’s arguments. There is no indication that
Defendant/Cross-Complainant has served discovery responses or that he has
otherwise complied with the Court’s Order dated June 24, 2022. There is also no
indication that any sanction would result in Defendant/Cross-Complainant
serving responses to Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant’s discovery requests. Rather,
considering Defendant/Cross-Complainant’s failure to serve discovery responses,
oppose motions to compel, or oppose this motion for terminating sanctions, it
appears that Defendant/Cross-Complainant has given up on this case. 
 
        In addition,
Defendant failed to appear at the Status Conference on September 11, 2023 and
did not file a Status Conference report for that hearing.  It appears to the Court that Defendant has
not only ignored this Court’s orders, but has chosen no longer to participate
in this litigation. 
 
        Given that the
Court is imposing terminating sanctions, further monetary sanctions for
Plaintiff would be excessive. (See Shakespeare, King John, Act 4, Scene 2 
“To gild refined gold, to paint the
lily,
To throw a perfume on the violet,
To smooth the ice, or add another hue
Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light
To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,
Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.”)
 
III.     Conclusion
 
The Motion is
GRANTED. 
 
Defendant/Cross-Complainant’s Answer to the Complaint
is STRICKEN. 
 
Defendant/Cross-Complainant’s Cross-Complaint is
DISMISSED with prejudice. 
 
An OSC re Entry of Default Judgement is scheduled for
the previous trial date of Feb. 28, 2024.
