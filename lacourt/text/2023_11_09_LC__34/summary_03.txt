And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motions to compel responses to discovery requests, including form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents. The judge also grants the motion to deem admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admissions. The judge denies the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions against the defendants. The judge finds that the defendants failed to respond to the discovery requests and requests for admissions, but notes that the plaintiff's request for sanctions is unreasonable and excessive. The judge orders the defendants to provide initial responses to the discovery requests within 14 days.
