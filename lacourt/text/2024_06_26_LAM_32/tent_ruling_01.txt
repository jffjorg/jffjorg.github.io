            v.

  Case No.:  20STCV41059
  Hearing Date:  June 26, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s quiet title claim 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On October 26, 2020, Plaintiff
Angela Hsu initiated this action against various Defendants for (1) quiet
title, (2) cancellation of instruments, and (3) usury. Plaintiff alleges that
she and her husband (Decedent) were joint tenants of real property located in
Oceanside, California as of September 1977 (the Property). In May 2015 and
October 2017, unbeknownst to Plaintiff, Decedent borrowed $100,000 and $50,000
from Defendants, secured by the Property. Decedent passed away in August 2020,
and Plaintiff alleges that as a result, she wholly owns the Property without
encumbrance. Defendants have refused to remove the subject liens from the
Property, prompting this lawsuit. 
            On March 4, 2021, Defendants Tsasu
LLC and Hestter Investment, LLC (collectively, the creditors) filed a
cross-complaint against Plaintiff for breach of contract and declaratory
relief, alleging that Plaintiff is responsible for the loans made to Decedent. 
            On August 1, 2022, Plaintiff filed
the First Amended Complaint, which added causes of action for unjust enrichment
and equitable indemnification against Pichi Lin (Lin). Plaintiff alleges that
Decedent and Lin made the loans together without Plaintiff’s knowledge and that
Lin benefitted from the money. Plaintiff alleges that if she is held liable to
the creditors, then in fairness Lin should be liable to her, since Lin was the
true beneficiary of the loans. 
On February 17, 2023, the Court sustained
Lin’s demurrer to the FAC because the facts did not support how Lin was
unjustly enriched or at fault for Plaintiff’s liability, since it is undisputed
that Decedent alone made the loans. However, the Court granted Plaintiff leave
to amend to allege a cause of action based on Family Code section 1100(b),
which allows a spouse to void an improper transfer of community property. The
Court also granted leave to assert causes of action based on improper rent
collection and forgery. 
On March 9, 2023, Plaintiff filed the
operative Second Amended Complaint incorporating the Family Code allegations
and adding causes of action for conversion and fraud by forgery. On May 8,
2023, the Court sustained Lin’s demurrer without leave to amend as to the
unjust enrichment and equitable indemnity claims.
On May 6, 2024, the Court granted Lin’s
motion to sever the causes of action against her from the causes of action
against the creditors. On May 9, 2024, the Court granted the parties’
stipulation for a briefing schedule and hearing on the issue of Plaintiff’s
first cause of action for quiet title.
On June 3, 2024, the parties filed their
opening briefs. On June 17, 2024, the parties filed their response briefs. 
DISCUSSION
I.
Current Status of the Property
“Except as otherwise provided by statute,
all property, real or personal, wherever situated, acquired by a married person
during the marriage while domiciled in this state is community property.” (Fam.
Code, § 760.) Section 760 is a standalone, general provision that applies to
“all” property acquired during marriage, including property acquired in joint
form. (In re Brace (2020) 9 Cal.5th 903, 927.) “Family Code section 760
does not permit the community property presumption to be rebutted simply by the
manner in which a married couple takes title.” (Ibid.) Section 760 also
applies outside of the dissolution context. (Id. at p. 930.) Section 760
is the contemporary standard applicable to characterization of property
acquired after January 1, 1975. (Id. at p. 927.) “[T]he rules
characterizing property as community or separate based on form of title have
faded in the contemporary statutory framework.” (Ibid.) 
However, neither section 760 nor In re
Brace abrogates the rule that “form of title controls the disposition of
joint tenancy property at death.” (In re Brace, supra, 9 Cal.5th at p.
933.) “The Legislature has expressly recognized that characterization of joint
tenancy property as community property does not ‘defeat the right of
survivorship.’” (Ibid.) “Each spouse's right of survivorship arising
from joint tenancy title remains an ‘expectancy’ that is realized upon the
other spouse's death.” (Ibid.) Therefore, the Supreme Court in In re
Brace expressly clarified that “[o]ur decision today does not alter the
well-established default rule that form of title controls at death.” (Id.
at p. 934.) Upon the death of one spouse, “‘the language of how title is held
in the deed (i.e., joint tenancy, tenants in common, or community property)
will be controlling and not the community property presumption.’” (Id.
at p. 932 [quoting Fam. Code, § 2040(c)].) “If one spouse dies . . . before
there is a judgment of dissolution, th[e] community property presumption does
not apply.” (Raney v. Cerkueira (2019) 36 Cal.App.5th 311, 321.) 
Here, Plaintiff and Decedent acquired
title to the Property as joint tenants while they were married. (Plntf.’s Ex. 1
at 35:21-23; Ex. 2.) Ordinarily, the community property presumption would
apply, and the joint title alone would not serve as evidence of a
transmutation. (Fam. Code, §§ 760, 852; In re Brace, supra, 9 Cal.5th at
p. 936.) However, as stated in In re Brace, the community property
presumption does not affect the rule that form of title controls at death. (In
re Brace, supra, 9 Cal.5th at p. 934.) Upon the death of one joint tenant,
the right of survivorship controls over the community property presumption. (Id.
at p. 932; Raney, supra, 36 Cal.App.5th at p. 321.) Therefore, upon
Decedent’s death, Plaintiff became the sole owner of the Property. (Grothe
v. Cortlandt Corp. (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1313, 1317.) 
II.
Effect on the Liens 
It is “settled law in California (and
other jurisdictions) that a lien that has attached to the interest of a joint
tenant expires upon the death of that tenant.” (Dieden v. Schmidt (2002)
104 Cal.App.4th 645, 651.) “[W]hen . . . a joint tenant dies his interest dies
with him, and any encumbrances placed by him on the property become
unenforceable against the surviving joint tenant.” (Tenhet v. Boswell
(1976) 18 Cal.3d 150, 159-60.) Therefore, for example, a surviving joint tenant
takes an estate free from a judgment lien on the interest of a deceased
cotenant judgment debtor. (Zeigler v. Bonnell (1942) 52 Cal.App.2d 217,
220-21.) A “deceased joint tenant ha[s] no interest in the property, and his
judgment creditor has no greater rights.” (Id. at p. 220.) For the same
reason, upon the death of a joint tenant who had unilaterally executed a
mortgage on the tenancy property, the surviving joint tenant takes the property
free of the mortgage. (People ex rel. Department of Public Works v. Nogarr
(1958) 164 Cal.App.2d 591, 594-95.) The mortgage lien attaches only to the
interest of the debtor tenant to the extent that he has one. (Id. at p.
594.) “[W]hen his interest cease[s] to exist the lien of the mortgage expire[s]
with it.” (Ibid.) “A creditor . . . may only levy on the interest of the
debtor tenant.” (Dieden, supra, 104 Cal.App.4th at p. 651.) 
In this case, the debtor tenant is
Decedent because it is undisputed that Decedent alone signed the loans.
(Plntf.’s Ex. 7, 8.) It is further undisputed that Plaintiff had no knowledge
of and did not consent to the loans. (Plntf.’s Ex. 1 at 26:2-27:3; Ex. 3 at
23:21-24:2.) Decedent lost his interest in the Property upon his death. (Tenhet,
supra, 18 Cal.3d at pp. 159-60.) Because Decedent’s creditors have “no
greater rights” than Decedent himself, the liens are extinguished. (Zeigler,
supra, 52 Cal.App.2d at p. 220.) The creditors cite no authority abrogating
the principles summarized above. In fact, the creditors in their own brief
acknowledge “the general rule is that a ‘surviving joint tenant’ takes a real
property free of an encumbrance placed upon it by the deceased joint tenant.”
(Def.’s Opening Br. 14:2-4.)      
            It is true that this may result in
the innocent creditor being left without recourse upon the death of a joint
tenant. However, courts “cannot allow extraneous factors to erode the
functioning of joint tenancy. The estate of joint tenancy is firmly embedded in
centuries of real property law and in the California statute books.” (Tenhet,
supra, 18 Cal.3d at p. 160.) “If the judgment debtor is the first to die,
the lien is lost. If the creditor sits back to await this contingency, . . . he
assumes the risk of losing his lien.” (Nogarr, supra, 164 Cal.App.2d at
p. 595.) 
In sum, the Court finds that Plaintiff
owns the Property free and clear of the subject liens. 
III.
Classification of the Debt 
            “Except as otherwise expressly
provided by statute, the community estate is liable for a debt incurred by
either spouse before or during marriage.” (Fam. Code, § 910(a).) “‘During
marriage’ for purposes of this section does not include the period after the
date of separation.” (Id., § 910(b).) “‘Date of separation’ means the
date that a complete and final break in the marital relationship has occurred,
as evidenced by both of the following: (1) The spouse has expressed to the
other spouse the intent to end the marriage. (2) The conduct of the spouse is
consistent with the intent to end the marriage.” (Id., § 70.) 
            Here, there is no dispute that the
date of separation was 1988 or 1989. (See Plntf.’s Ex. 1 at 24:19-25:10.) There
is also no dispute that the loans were obtained in 2015 and 2017 by Decedent
only. (Plntf.’s Ex. 7, 8.) Therefore, the loans are not community debts but
rather Decedent’s separate debts.
