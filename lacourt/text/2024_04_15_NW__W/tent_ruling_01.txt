BACKGROUND
 
On December 9, 2022, Plaintiff Gal Gawy
filed a complaint against Defendants Francisco Sibrian and Los Angeles Unified
School District for 1. Negligence 2. Negligent Entrustment 3. Neligent Hiring
4. Vicarious Liability 5. Violation of Vehicle Code 17001. Plaintiff alleges on
October 1, 2021, Plaintiff Gawy was driving his vehicle traveling on the
roadway when Defendant Sibrian was driving an agricultural vehicle and unsafely
and negligently crashed into Plaintiff at or near Tampa and Vanowen. Plaintiff
alleges Defendant failed to keep proper lookout, failed to keep a safe
distance, and failed to travel at a speed safe for the existing traffic. 
 
On July 21, 2023, Defendant LAUSD filed
a cross-complaint against Gal Gawy and Joseph Gawy for indemnification,
apportionment of fault, declaratory relief, and motor vehicle negligence. 
 
Plaintiff filed a notice of death of
Cross-Defendant Joseph Gawy on July 26, 2023. LAUSD dismissed Joseph Gawy from
the Cross-Complaint on September 11, 2023.
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Defendant’s
Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Compliance with Discovery Responses Under Code of
Civil Procedure section 2031.320(a) is GRANTED
 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendant Los Angeles Unified School
District moves the court for an order compelling Plaintiff to produce documents
consistent with his responses to Defendant LAUSD’s Request for Production of
Documents, Set One served on December 18, 2023. Defendant LAUSD also seeks
sanctions in the amount of $375.00 against both Plaintiff, and Plaintiff’s
attorney, Shahin Shawn Karimian, Esq. of Karimian Law Group, for the continued
failure to comply to this authorized method of discovery.  
 
“If a party
filing a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling
under Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280 thereafter
fails to permit the inspection, copying, testing, or sampling in accordance
with that party’s statement of compliance, the demanding party may move for an
order compelling compliance.”  (CCP §2031.320(a).) 
 
On July 21,
2023, Defendant LAUSD propounded Request for Production of Documents, Set One
to Plaintiff. (Beckles Decl. ¶5, Exh. A.) After going back and forth, Plaintiff
eventually served verified responses to the Request for Production of
Documents, Set One on December 18, 2023. (Beckles Decl. ¶¶6-7, Exh. B.) Defendant
LAUSD, however, was not served with Plaintiff’s document production. (Beckles
Decl. ¶8.) Defendant LAUSD met and conferred several times requesting the
missing document production; however, to date, Defendant LAUSD has not received
Plaintiff’s discovery responses propounded on July 21, 2023. (Beckles Decl.
¶¶9-10.) No opposition has been filed. 
 
The court GRANTS
Defendant’s motion pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.320.
Plaintiff is ordered to produce documents to responses it stated it would and
failed to do so. 
 
Sanctions
 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 2031.320(b) provides the court shall impose a monetary
sanction against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel compliance with a demand, unless it finds that the
one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.  (CCP §2031.320(b).)
 
Defendant
seeks sanctions in the amount of $375.00 on the grounds Plaintiff cannot
provide any justification for its refusal to comply with his own agreement to
produce responsive documents. The court GRANTS Defendant LAUSD’s request for
monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and his counsel of record, Shahin Shawn
Karimian, Esq. of Karimian Law Group.
