            This case arises from an employment discrimination
suit. Plaintiff Kate Richardson (Plaintiffs) filed suit against her
employer, Defendant Wear it to Heart, Inc. for (1.) Wrongful Termination in
Violation of Public Policy, (2.) Sexual Harassment in Violation of FEHA –
Hostile Work Environment (Cal. Govt. Code § 12940(j)), (3.) Failure to Prevent
Discrimination, Retaliation, and/or Harassment in Violation of FEHA (Cal. Govt.
Code § 12940(k)), (4.) Labor Code Section 98.6, (5.) Retaliation in Violation
of the FEHA (Cal. Govt. Code § 12940(h)), and (6.) Failure To Pay Timely Wages
During Employment (Cal. Lab. Code § 204).
 
            On December 14, 2023, Defendant/Cross-Complainant
Wear it to Heart, Inc. filed a Cross-Complaint
against Cross-Defendant Kate Richardson, alleging a single cause of action for
a violation of Penal Code section 502. 
 
Cross-Defendant
Kate Richardson demurred to the Cross-Complaint. Cross-Defendant also moved to
strike allegations in the Cross-Complaint. Cross-Complainant opposes the
demurrer and the motion to strike. 
 
            The demurrer to the Cross-Complaint
is sustained with leave to amend. The Motion to strike is moot.
 
Demurrer
 
            A demurrer is an
objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the
face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985)
39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency
of a pleading “by raising questions of law.” (Postley v. Harvey (1984)
153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a pleading, for the purpose
of determining its effect, its allegations must be liberally construed, with a
view to substantial justice between the parties.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) The
court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly
pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law . . ..” ’
” (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.)  
 
Analysis 
            
First Cause of
Action for Violation of Penal Code section 502:  
 
            Cross-Defendant argues that the
first cause of action for a violation of Comprehensive Computer Data Access and
Fraud Act (CDAFA) fails to state a claim because no individualized harm, and no
unauthorized conduct, were alleged. 
            To bring a private civil cause of action under section
502, which is otherwise a criminal statute, CDAFA creates a private cause of
action against any person who “[k]nowingly accesses and without permission
takes, copies, or makes use of any data from a computer, computer system, or
computer network, or take or copies any supporting documentation, whether
existing or residing internal or external to a computer, computer system, or
computer network.” (Pen. Code, § 502(c)(2) & (e)(1).) The CDAFA defines
“access” to mean “cause output from” the “logical, arithmetical, or memory
function resources of a computer.” (Pen. Code, § 502(b)(1).) Furthermore, the
statute requires that such access be “without permission.” (Pen. Code, §
502(c)(1)–(2).)
            Further, the plaintiff must plead that the plaintiff
“suffer[ed] damage or loss” due to the criminal violation. (Pen. Code, §
502(e).)
In Heiting
v. Taro Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (C.D. Cal., Dec. 26, 2023, No.
2:23-CV-08002-SPG-E) 2023 WL 9319049, the court considered whether the loss of
some of data qualifies as a “damage or loss” under the statute. The Heiting Court
explained that the “majority of courts” have found that “alleged privacy
invasions do not qualify under the statute.” (Id. at *7; Cottle v. Plaid Inc.
(N.D. Cal. 2021) 536 F. Supp. 3d 461, 488 [finding damage or loss under CDAFA
did not include “loss of the right to control [Plaintiffs'] own data, the loss
of the value of their data, and the loss of the right to protection of the
data”].)[1]
Here,
the Cross-Complaint alleges that, on October 25, 2022, Cross-Defendant
Richardson knowingly accessed and without permission took or copied data
from a computer, computer system and computer network belonging to Cross-Complainant;
this data included Cross- Complainant’s valuable customers and potential
customers contact information. (XC ¶ 15.) 
 
The
Cross-Complaint alleges only the misappropriation of certain information. Thus,
the Cross-Complaint does not allege an adequate economic injury to support a
violation of Penal Code section 502.
 
Cross-Defendant
also argues that the Cross-Complaint fails to allege any “unauthorized” access.

While the term “without permission”
is not defined within the language of the statute, courts have found that “[a]
party acts ‘without permission’ under the CDAFA when it ‘circumvents
technical or code-based barriers in place to restrict or bar a user's
access.’” (Williams v. Facebook, Inc. (N.D. Cal. 2018) 384 F.Supp.3d
1043, 1053; Facebook,
Inc. v. Power Ventures, Inc. (N.D. Cal., July 20, 2010, No. C 08-05780 JW)
2010 WL 3291750, at *11; In re iPhone Application Litig. (N.D. Cal.,
Sept. 20, 2011, No. 11-MD-02250-LHK) 2011 WL 4403963, at *12.) 
Here,
the pleadings indicate that Cross-Defendant Richardson was employed by Cross-Complainant
at the time she “took or copied” the data. (XC ¶ 15.) There is no allegation
that Cross-Defendant Richardson “circumvent[ed] technical or code-based
barriers” to access this information. Thus, the claim fails for this additional
reason, as well.
 
The
demurrer to the first cause of action is sustained. 
 
Motion to
Strike Allegations in the Cross-Complaint: 
 
            The demurrer papers also request “that
Paragraphs 7-11 of the Cross Complaint be stricken.” (Dem., 7:2-3.) 
 
            In opposition, Cross-Complainant
argues that Cross-Defendant Richardson failed to comply with California Rules
of Court, Rule 3.1322, subdivision (b).
            California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1322, subdivision (b)
only requires that, if a defendant attacks a complaint with a demurrer and
motion to strike, both matters must be heard at the same time. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1322, subd. (b).) Although it is better practice to file a
demurrer and a motion to strike separately (Weil & Brown, Motions to
Strike, Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial Ch. 7(I)-B [7:162:1]), there is
no express rule prohibiting a defendant from combining a demurrer and motion to
strike in one document, as was done here. 
            In any case, the motion to strike
portions of the Cross-Complaint has been rendered moot by the ruling on the
demurrer. 
 
Conclusion
 
            The demurrer to the Cross-Complaint is sustained.
The motion to strike is moot. Cross-Complainant shall have leave to amend. The
amended Cross-Complaint shall be filed and served on or before May 17, 2024.
