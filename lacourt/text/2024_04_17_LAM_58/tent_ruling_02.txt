Thomas E. Morgann, III


Tentative
Ruling:      The Motion for Relief from
Failure to File Motion to Tax Costs is denied. 

 
Plaintiff,
attorney Richard Pech, represented Defendant Thomas E. Morgan, III (Morgan) in
numerous legal matters. Pech alleged that Morgan breached the parties’ written
retainer agreement by failing to pay all amounts owed, which had reached
$525,914.90 at the time of Pech’s withdrawal as attorney in an underlying trust
litigation matter. 
 
Pech’s Second
Amended Complaint alleged causes of action for (1.) breach of written contract,
(2.) account stated, (3.) false promise, (4.) intentional misrepresentation, (5.)
quantum meruit, (6.) breach of oral contract, and (8.) quantum meruit.
 
Defendant Morgan
filed a cross-complaint. The Second Amended Cross-Complaint alleges causes of
action for (1.) legal malpractice, (2.) breach of fiduciary duty, (3.) legal malpractice,
(4.) breach of fiduciary duty, and (5.) equitable disgorgement. 
 
The jury returned
a mixed verdict. It rejected attorney Pech’s claim for breach of contract, and
awarded him, on theories of quantum meruit and account stated, $497,880.90 in
“damages.” The jury also found that Plaintiff Pech had acted negligently
toward, and thereby caused harm to, his client and awarded Morgan $323,188.25. A
Judgment was entered on September 29, 2023, which found Plaintiff Pech was
entitled to a judgment against Defendant Morgan in the net amount of
$174,692.65. 
 
Thereafter, Defendant
Morgan filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and Plaintiff
Pech filed motion for new trial. The Court granted Defendant Morgan’s motion
for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The Court denied Pech’s motion for
new trial. On January 19, 2024, a new Judgment was entered finding that Defendant
Morgan was the prevailing party and that Plaintiff Pech shall pay Defendant
Morgan the amount of $323,188.25.
 
On February 2,
2024, Defendant Morgan filed and served a Memorandum of Costs in the amount of
$59,232.33. 
 
On March 20, 2024,
Plaintiff Pech filed a motion for relief from his failure to file a motion to
tax costs. Defendant Morgan opposed the motion. 
 
A motion to tax
costs must be filed and served within 15 days after service of the memorandum of
costs.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1700(b)(1).) Morgan’s Memorandum of Costs was delivered electronically on
February 2, 2024, and is deemed to have been served that day. (Ibid.;
Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6, subd. (a)(4).) 
Pech’s motion to tax costs had to be filed on or before February 20,
2024.  Failure timely to serve and file
the motion to tax costs waives objections to the claimed costs. (Douglas v. Willis
(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 287, 290.)
 
The Motion for
Relief from Failure to File Motion to Tax Costs is denied. 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff Pech moves
for relief from his failure to file a timely motion to tax costs pursuant to
both the mandatory and discretionary grounds set forth in Code of Civil
Procedure section 473, subdivision (b).
 
As a preliminary
matter, Plaintiff – as a self-represented litigant – is not entitled to mandatory
relief. (Esther B. v. City of Los Angeles (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1093, 1100 [“Granting mandatory relief to
parties appearing in pro per, even if they are attorneys, would not serve any
of the purposes of the legislation. In these situations the “client” is not
innocent, there is no one to whom the blame can be shifted and there is no risk
of a malpractice action because the client would have to sue herself.”]; Martin Potts & Associates, Inc. v. Corsair, LLC (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 432, 439.) Thus, the motion is denied on this
ground. 
 
Section 473, subdivision (b), also grants the court discretion “upon any
terms as may be just,” to “relieve a party or his or her legal representative
from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her
through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” (See
Zamora v. Clayborn Contracting Group, Inc. (2002) 28 Cal.4th 249, 254.)
 
A court may grant discretionary
relief under section 473 where a party fails to timely file a motion to tax
costs. (See e.g., Lane v. Pacific Greyhound Lines (1947) 30 Cal.2d 914,
916-917.)  
 
In support of the motion for discretionary relief, Plaintiff Pech represents
that, although he was served on February 2, 2024 with the Memorandum of Costs, he “did
not learn of the Memorandum of Costs until staff observed on February 28, 2024
in [Plaintiff’s] emails that First Legal had served [him] on February 2, 2024.”
(Pech Decl., ¶ 5.)  Plaintiff continues by
arguing that “[t]he failure of staff to either review [his] emails earlier as [was]
[his] custom and practice for them to do, or for [him] to observe it before
staff brought it to my attention was a mistake and/or neglect on behalf of my
staff and myself.” (Pech Decl., ¶ 6.) 
 
Plaintiff seeks relief
based on mistake or excusable neglect. 
 
“Neglect is
excusable only if a reasonably prudent person in similar circumstances might
have made the same error. [Citations.] Relevant factors in assessing counsel
error include: ‘(1) the nature of the mistake or neglect; and (2) whether
counsel was otherwise diligent in investigating and pursuing the claim.’
[Citation.] ‘Conduct falling below the professional standard of care ... is not
therefore excusable.’ [Citations.] ‘To hold otherwise would be to eliminate the
express statutory requirement of excusability and effectively eviscerate the
concept of attorney malpractice.’ [Citation.]” (Huh v. Wang (2008) 158
Cal.App.4th 1406, 1423.)
 
In Huh v. Wang, supra, 158 Cal.App.4th at page 1423, the
court noted that “ ‘press of business' alone generally does not constitute
grounds for relief” under section 473. Rather, “[t]o constitute grounds for
relief, an exceptional workload generally must be accompanied by some factor
outside the attorney's control that makes the situation unmanageable, such as a
mistake ‘caused by a glitch in the office machinery or an error by clerical
staff.’ “ (Id. at p. 1424; Ambrose v. Michelin North America, Inc.
(2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1354-1355.)
 
This rule applies to Plaintiff, even though he is self-represented.
“Under the law, a party may choose to act as his or her own attorney.
[Citations.] ‘[S]uch a party is to be treated like any other party and is
entitled to the same, but no greater consideration than other litigants and
attorneys. [Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (Nwosu v. Uba (2004) 122
Cal.App.4th 1229, 1246–1247.) Thus, a self-represented litigant is not entitled
to lenient treatment. (Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975,
984–985.)
 
Plaintiff’s evidence is inadequate to warrant discretionary relief.
Plaintiff’s barebones declaration asserting that neither he nor his staff noticed
the Memorandum of Costs does not provide any explanation – reasonable or
unreasonable – for this oversight. There is no declaration from any staff
member providing an explanation for the failure to notify Plaintiff. Moreover, Plaintiff’s
own declaration merely suggests that he normally relies on staff to notify him –
although he also had access to his own email and failed to timely respond to
the Memorandum of Costs. 
 
Plaintiff has not presented adequate evidence of a mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
 
Conclusion
 
            The Motion
for Relief from Failure to File Motion to Tax Costs is denied.
