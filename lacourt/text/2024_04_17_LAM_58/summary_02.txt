And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The motion for relief from failure to file a timely motion to tax costs is denied. The plaintiff, Richard Pech, failed to file a timely motion to tax costs, despite being served with the memorandum of costs on February 2, 2024. Pech claims that he did not learn of the memorandum of costs until February 28, 2024, and that his staff did not notify him of the memorandum of costs. However, the court finds that Pech's evidence is inadequate to warrant discretionary relief. The court concludes that Pech's barebones declaration asserting that neither he nor his staff noticed the memorandum of costs does not provide any explanation – reasonable or unreasonable – for this oversight.
