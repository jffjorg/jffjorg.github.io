SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Wendy
Viridinia Solano-Castro, et al. alleges the wrongful death of Raul Garcia-Leon
caused from as a stone fabricator and installer. Plaintiffs contend working
with “toxic” stone products led to the development of silicosis and death of
Garcia-Leon on February 16, 2023.
 
On
May 22, 2023, Plaintiff filed a 582 paragraph complaint for negligence, strict
liability – warning defect, strict liability – design defect, fraudulent
concealment, and breach of implied warranties. On May 31, 2023, Plaintiff a 235
page first amended complaint for negligence, strict liability – warning defect,
strict liability – design defect, fraudulent concealment, and breach of implied
warranties. The action names a multitude of parties comprised of suppliers,
sellers, etc. The case was deemed non-complex on June 5, 2023, and assigned to
Department 68 on June 7, 2023. 
 
On
October 11, 2023, the court sustained the demurrer to the first amended
complaint brought by MS International, Inc. to the fourth cause of action with
20 days leave to amend. On October 18, 2023, the court overruled the demurrer
to the fourth cause of action brought by M S International, Inc. On November 2,
2023, Caesarstone USA, Inc. filed a cross-complaint for indemnity, declaratory
relief and apportionment. On December 29, 2023, Lowes Home Centers, LLC filed a
cross-complaint indemnity, declaratory relief and apportionment.
 
On
September 5, 2024, the court granted the motion for trial preference based on
the age of Rebecca Garcia at the time of the filing of the motion.

Defendant
Cambria Company, LLC (Cambria) moves for summary judgment on the entire
complaint, and alternatively, summary adjudication on the claim for punitive
damages. Cambria moves on a few grounds: Lack of evidence establishing
causation, a complete defense under the Federal Hazards Communications Act, and
sophisticated intermediary/user doctrine. Plaintiffs in opposition challenge
the motion on grounds that Cambria fails to shift the burden of proof, due to
the lack of sufficient competent evidence, and denial of application of the
sophisticated user defense.
 
The pleadings frame the issues for motions, “since it is those
allegations to which the motion must respond. (Citation.)” (Scolinos v. Kolts (1995) 37 Cal. App.
4th 635, 640-641; FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima
(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 382-383; Jordan-Lyon
Prods., LTD. v. Cineplex Odeon Corp. (1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1459, 1472.)
The purpose of a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication “is to
provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order
to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to
resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atl.
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) 
“Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), requires the
trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all
inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other
inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material
fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  (Adler
v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)  
 
“On a motion for summary judgment, the initial burden is
always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no
triable issues of material fact.” (Scalf
v. D.B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) A defendant
moving for summary judgment “has met his or her burden of showing that a cause
of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the
cause of action . . . cannot be established.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) “Once the defendant . . . has
met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a
triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or
a defense thereto.” (Ibid.) 
 
A defendant may alternatively move for summary judgment on
grounds that Plaintiff lacks
sufficient evidence, and cannot reasonably obtain necessary evidence in support
of the claims.¿(Aguilar v. Atl.
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th at pp. 854-855; Collin
v. CalPortland Co. (2014)
228 Cal.App.4th 582, 587; Andrews v. Foster Wheeler LLC (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 96, 101; Union Bank v. Superior Court (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 573, 590.) The
court adheres to this standard for product liability cases, such as asbestos
and crystalline silica (e.g. latent exposure leading to mesothelioma or
silicosis).
 
“When deciding whether to grant summary judgment, the court
must consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers (except evidence to
which the court has sustained an objection), as well as all reasonable
inference that may be drawn form that evidence, in the light most favorable to
the party opposing summary judgment.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159
Cal.App.4th 463, 467; see also Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).) “An
issue of fact can only be created by a conflict in the evidence.  It is not created by speculation, conjecture,
imagination or guesswork.”  (Lyons v. Security Pacific National Bank
(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1001, 1041 (citation omitted).)
 
Cambria relies on denial of any supply, manufacture or
distribution of silica containing products utilized by Decedent, while employed
as a fabricator. The position relies entirely on a challenge to Plaintiffs’
evidence, and otherwise offers no challenge to the allegation that Cambria
engaged in the manufacture/supply/distribution of silica containing artificial
stone products.
 
The court finds the subject matter analogous to
asbestos litigation on the basis of latent injury caused by a dangerous
product, and therefore applies the substantial factor standard in the subject
action. (Lineaweaver v. Plant Insulation
Company (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1409, 1415, 1419.) “In the context of a cause
of action for asbestos-related latent injuries, the plaintiff must first
establish some threshold exposure to the
defendant's defective asbestos-containing products, and must further establish in reasonable medical probability
that a particular exposure or series of exposures was a “legal cause” of his
injury, i.e., a substantial factor in bringing
about the injury. In an asbestos-related cancer case, the plaintiff need not prove that fibers from the defendant's product were the
ones, or among the ones, that actually began the process of malignant cellular
growth. Instead, the plaintiff may meet the burden of proving that exposure to
defendant's product was a substantial factor causing the illness by showing
that in reasonable medical probability it contributed to the plaintiff or
decedent's risk of developing
cancer.” Rutherford v. Owens-Illinois,
Inc. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 953, 982. “[W]e conclude that the proper
analysis is to ask whether the plaintiff has proven exposure to a defendant's
product, of whatever duration, so that exposure is a possible factor in causing
the disease and then to evaluate whether the exposure was a substantial
factor.”  (Lineaweaver v. Plant Insulation Company, supra, 31
Cal.App.4th at p. 1416.)  Exposure by a
contributing party, among many, is sufficient to establish triable issues of
material fact.  The calculation of the
probabilities of whether even limited exposure constituted a substantial factor
is more appropriately addressed before the trial court.  (Id.
at pp. 1417-1419.)
 
“In the
context of a cause of action for asbestos-related latent injuries, the
plaintiff must first establish some threshold exposure to the
defendant's defective [] products, and must further
establish in reasonable medical probability that a particular exposure or
series of exposures was a ‘legal cause’ of his injury, i.e., a substantial
factor in bringing about the injury. In a[] [silicosis] case, the
plaintiff need not prove that [particulate]
from the defendant's product were the ones, or among the ones, that actually
began the process of malignant cellular growth. Instead, the plaintiff may meet
the burden of proving that exposure to defendant's product was a substantial
factor causing the illness by showing that in reasonable medical probability it
contributed to the plaintiff or decedent's risk of developing
[silicosis].” (Rutherford v. Owens-Illinois,
Inc. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 953, 982.)
 
Other than citation to discovery responses (without
indicating the relevant responses) regarding the basis of the complaint,
including the performance of stone fabrication work without sufficient
protective equipment, the court finds no substantive basis for the challenge to
the insufficiency of evidence by Plaintiffs regarding the placement of Cambria
manufactured and/or distributed silica containing artificial stone products on
the premises of any and all of Decedent’s employers during the relevant exposure
period. [See Declaration of Cassidy H. Tynan, Index of Exhibits.] The
conclusive argument and reliance on denial of sufficient evidence fails to
shift the burden. (See McGonnell v. Kaiser Gypsum Co., Inc. (2002)
98 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1103-1104; Scheiding v. Dinwiddie Const. Co. (1999)
69 Cal.App.4th 64, 81.) 
 
The court alternatively finds triable issues of material
fact based on the presence of Cambria vehicles and products on the premises of
Decedent’s place of employment during the relevant time period. Plaintiffs present
testimony identifying Cambria vehicles and products for Bernadino’s shop, and
invoices and sales of Cambria slabs to Bernadino’s shops. [Declaration of Scott
Brust: Deposition of Cesar Quiroz, 68:24-69:14, 164:14-165:2, 342:19- 344:10,
561:4-25.; Declaration of Simonetta Marshall, Exh. A.] The exposure to said
silica containing stone products caused exposure and led to the silicosis
diagnosis and death. [Declaration of Kenneth Rosenman.]
 
The motion for summary judgment reliant on the absence of
sufficient causation is therefore DENIED. 
 
On the ground of sophisticated/intermediate user, the court
reviews the standard. “In general, a manufacturer or
supplier has a duty to warn consumers about the dangers and risks inherent in
the use of its product. (Citations.) The sophisticated user defense is an exception to the general duty to
warn. (Citation.) The defense concerns warnings and does not apply to a
cause of action for design defect. (Citation.) ... [¶] Under
the sophisticated user defense, a manufacturer is not liable to a sophisticated
user of its product for failure to warn about the product's dangers if the
sophisticated user knew or should have known of the dangers. (Citation.)
The ‘should have known’ portion of the formulation is an objective standard. (Citation.) ...
The rationale supporting the defense is that the failure to warn about risks
already known to a sophisticated user usually is not a proximate cause of the
user's injuries. (Citation.)” (Collin v. CalPortland Co. (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th at pp. 601–602.)
 
Cambria relies on an apparent denial of any necessity to
warn based on OSHA/Cal OSHA regulations regarding employer responsibility to
provide safety equipment, due to an admittedly known hazard of silica
particulate matter from stone fabrication. Other than an admission to the
hazards of silica dust, the motion lacks legal support actually addressing the
standard for warning or evidence of the sufficiency of its warning, and instead
offers deflection. To the extent Cambria suggests a sophisticated intermediary
defense, the court also finds no legal or evidentiary support based on reliance
and deflection under uncited OSHA and Cal OSHA standards. (Webb v. Special Electric Co., Inc. (2016) 63 Cal.4th 167, 187-188.) T 
 
The court therefore DENIES the
motion for summary judgment on the failure to establish both insufficient
evidence or a complete defense on this basis. Plaintiff additionally
establishes triable issues of material fact on the known hazards of silica
particulate matter resulting from fabrication, the warning to Decedent’s
employer, and Decedent’s employers’ sophistication. [Declaration of Kenneth Rosenman;
Declaration of Brian P. Barrow: Deposition of
Bernardino Sanchez, 159:8-16.]
 
To the extent Cambria moves for
summary adjudication of the fraudulent concealment cause of action, which is
unclear from the notice and moving papers, Cambria challenges the lack
of any basis of duty to disclose any specific potential harms from the failure
to warn. Cambria relies exclusively on the lack of any duty to disclose due to
the absence of any fiduciary duty. “[T]he elements of a cause of action for
fraud based on concealment are: ‘(1) the defendant must have concealed or
suppressed a material fact, (2) the defendant must have been under a duty to
disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3) the defendant must have intentionally
concealed or suppressed the fact with the intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4)
the plaintiff must have been unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he
did if he had known of the concealed or suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of
the concealment or suppression of the fact, the plaintiff must have sustained
damage. [Citation.]’” (Kaldenbach v. Mutual of Omaha Life Ins. Co.
(2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 830, 850 (internal quotation marks omitted.) 
 
“There are ‘four
circumstances in which nondisclosure or concealment may constitute actionable
fraud: (1) when the defendant is in a fiduciary relationship with the
plaintiff; (2) when the defendant had exclusive knowledge of material facts not
known to the plaintiff; (3) when the defendant actively conceals a material
fact from the plaintiff; and (4) when the defendant makes partial
representations but also suppresses some material facts. [Citation.]’” (LiMandri v. Judkins (1997) 52
Cal.App.4th 326, 336.) “Each of the other three circumstances in which
nondisclosure may be actionable presupposes the existence of some other
relationship between the plaintiff and defendant in which a duty to disclose
can arise. … As a matter of common sense, such a relationship can only come
into being as a result of some sort of transaction between the parties.” (Id. at pp. 336–337.) 
 
“The
requirement's purpose is to inform consumers about a product's hazards and
faults of which they are unaware, so that they can refrain from using the
product altogether or evade the danger by careful use.” (Jones v.
ConocoPhillips Co. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 1187, 1198.) Users include
persons responsible for processing materials not privy to information regarding
necessary safety protocols. The withholding of said information subjects a
defendant to potential fraudulent concealment liability. (Id. at pp.
1199-1200.)
 
The operative complaint presents allegations
regarding knowledge of the allegedly toxic substance, crystalline silica,
dangers to workers engaged in the cutting, grinding, fabrication, polishing,
etc. with the product, and failure to disclose potential toxicity upon working
with said products. Decedent was specifically exposed and harmed as a result of
the non-disclosed hazards and continued work with the supplied product. The
allegations meet the standard for fraudulent concealment. (Bockrath v. Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc.
(1999) 21 Cal.4th 71, 78-79.)
 
Under the consideration for product liability summary judgment,
the court finds insufficient address of this standard by Cambria for purposes
of shifting the burden. The court therefore denies the motion for summary
adjudication on both the failure to shift the burden, and triable issues of
material fact regarding failure to warn on allegedly known hazards caused by
fabrication of products containing silica. [Declaration of Kenneth Rosenman; Declaration
of Brian P. Barrow: Deposition of Bernardino Sanchez, 159:8-16.]
 
On the second item for summary adjudication, punitive damages, Cambria
offers a conclusive challenge regarding the lack of evidence to support the
claim for punitive damages, and state that they did provide a MSDS with
warnings. On punitive damages, Civil Code section 3294, subdivision (c) authorizes
punitive damages upon a showing of malice, oppression, or fraud, which are defined as follows:
 
(1) “Malice” means
conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or
despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and
conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.
(2) “Oppression”
means despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in
conscious disregard of that person’s rights.
(3) “Fraud” means an
intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact known
to the defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby
depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.
 
“‘[M]alice does not require actual
intent to harm. [Citation.] Conscious disregard for the safety of another may
be sufficient where the defendant is aware of the probable dangerous
consequences of his or her conduct and he or she willfully fails to avoid such
consequences. [Citation.] Malice may be proved either expressly through direct
evidence or by implication through indirect evidence from which the jury draws
inferences.’ [Citations.]”  (Pfeifer
v. John Crane, Inc. (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 1270, 1299.) 
 
Consistent with the prior part of the order, the
court again finds the motion insufficiently addresses the evidence presented by
Plaintiffs regarding the knowing distribution of the silica containing product,
including corporate knowledge and direction for the manufacture and
distribution of an allegedly harmful product. The court additionally finds
triable issues of material fact on the basis of knowledge, ratification, and
malice. [Index of Exhibits: Responses to Specially Drafted Interrogatories;
Declaration of Brian P. Barrow: Deposition of Jon Grzeskowiak, and Cambria’s
Safety Data Sheet.] (White
v. Ultramar, Inc. (1999) 21 Cal.4th 563, 576–577; Cruz v. HomeBase (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th
160, 168.) The
motion for summary adjudication is therefore denied in its entirety. 
 
In summary, the court denies the motion for summary judgment
and summary adjudication.

Defendant
M S International, Inc. (MSI) moves for summary adjudication on the fourth
cause of action for fraudulent concealment, and the claim for punitive damages.
MSI moves on grounds that it provided warnings and safety sheets, and that
Plaintiffs are unable to establish that any officer, director, or managing
agent of Defendant ever acted with oppression, fraud, or malice towards
Decedent or Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs in opposition challenge the motion on
grounds that MSI fails to shift the burden of proof, due to the lack of
sufficient competent evidence, and a failure to establish Plaintiff lacks
sufficient evidence to prevail. 
 
The pleadings frame the issues for motions, “since it is those
allegations to which the motion must respond. (Citation.)”  (Scolinos
v. Kolts (1995) 37 Cal. App. 4th 635, 640-641; FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 382-383; Jordan-Lyon Prods., LTD. v. Cineplex Odeon Corp. (1994) 29
Cal.App.4th 1459, 1472.) The purpose of a motion for summary judgment or
summary adjudication “is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the
parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations,
trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atl. Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.)  “Code of Civil Procedure section 437c,
subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the
evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’
and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.”  (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)  
 
“On a motion for summary judgment, the initial burden is
always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no
triable issues of material fact.” (Scalf
v. D.B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) A defendant
moving for summary judgment “has met his or her burden of showing that a cause
of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the
cause of action . . . cannot be established.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) “Once the defendant . . . has
met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a
triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or
a defense thereto.” (Ibid.) 
 
A defendant may alternatively move for summary judgment on
grounds that Plaintiff lacks
sufficient evidence, and cannot reasonably obtain necessary evidence in support
of the claims.¿(Aguilar v. Atl.
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th at pp. 854-855; Collin
v. CalPortland Co. (2014)
228 Cal.App.4th 582, 587; Andrews v. Foster Wheeler LLC (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 96, 101 [41 Cal.Rptr.3d 229, 234]
855Union Bank v. Superior Court (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 573, 590.) The
court adheres to this standard for product liability cases, such as asbestos
and crystalline silica (e.g. latent exposure leading to mesothelioma or
silicosis).
 
“When deciding whether to grant summary judgment, the court
must consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers (except evidence to
which the court has sustained an objection), as well as all reasonable
inference that may be drawn form that evidence, in the light most favorable to
the party opposing summary judgment.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159
Cal.App.4th 463, 467; see also Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).) “An
issue of fact can only be created by a conflict in the evidence.  It is not created by speculation, conjecture,
imagination or guesswork.”  (Lyons v. Security Pacific National Bank
(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1001, 1041 (citation omitted).)
 
“[T]he
elements of a cause of action for fraud based on concealment are: ‘(1) the
defendant must have concealed or suppressed a material fact, (2) the defendant
must have been under a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3) the
defendant must have intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the
intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have been unaware of
the fact and would not have acted as he did if he had known of the concealed or
suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of the concealment or suppression of the
fact, the plaintiff must have sustained damage. [Citation.]’” (Kaldenbach v.
Mutual of Omaha Life Ins. Co. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 830, 850 (internal
quotation marks omitted.) 
 
On Fraudulent Concealment, MSI argues that it did not
conceal or suppress any material fact because it provided warnings and safety
sheets. In support of this, MSI provides the declaration of MSI’s co-CEO Rupesh
Shah, but the court finds the declaration inadmissible as it is based on
information and belief and lacks foundation for its assertions. Even if it were
admissible, Shah provides only 4 sentences generally stating that, on
information and belief, it provided warnings and safety sheets since 1996 and
that it has not withheld or concealed any information from its warnings or
safety sheets. This is insufficient and does not provide any information as to
the warnings or safety sheets provided. Further, MSI’s discussion as to Decedent’s
employer is irrelevant.
 
As this is the only evidence and argument
presented, the court denies the motion for summary adjudication on the
failure to shift the burden.
 
On punitive damages, MSI challenges the sufficiency against the
corporate entity. MSI generally states that Plaintiffs have no evidence to
support this claim and relies on the same arguments made for the fraud cause of
action. 
 
On punitive damages, Civil
Code section 3294, subdivision (c) authorizes punitive damages upon a showing
of malice, oppression, or fraud, which are defined as follows:
 
(1) “Malice” means
conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or
despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and
conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.
(2) “Oppression”
means despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in
conscious disregard of that person’s rights.
(3) “Fraud” means an
intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact known
to the defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby
depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.
 
“‘[M]alice does not require actual
intent to harm. [Citation.] Conscious disregard for the safety of another may
be sufficient where the defendant is aware of the probable dangerous
consequences of his or her conduct and he or she willfully fails to avoid such
consequences. [Citation.] Malice may be proved either expressly through direct
evidence or by implication through indirect evidence from which the jury draws
inferences.’ [Citations.]”  (Pfeifer
v. John Crane, Inc. (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 1270, 1299.) 
 
Consistent with the prior part of the order, the
court again finds that MSI presents no actual evidence in support of its
contentions, does not point to any absence of evidence such as devoid discovery
responses, and relies on its arguments regarding the fraud cause of action
which fail as discussed above. The motion for summary adjudication is therefore
denied in its entirety. 
 
In summary, the court denies the motion for summary
adjudication.

Viridinia Solano-Castro, et al. alleges the wrongful death of Raul Garcia-Leon
caused from as a stone fabricator and installer. Plaintiffs contend working
with “toxic” stone products led to the development of silicosis and death of
Garcia-Leon on February 16, 2023.
 
On
May 22, 2023, Plaintiff filed a 582 paragraph complaint for negligence, strict
liability – warning defect, strict liability – design defect, fraudulent
concealment, and breach of implied warranties. On May 31, 2023, Plaintiff a 235
page first amended complaint for negligence, strict liability – warning defect,
strict liability – design defect, fraudulent concealment, and breach of implied
warranties. The action names a multitude of parties comprised of suppliers,
sellers, etc. The case was deemed non-complex on June 5, 2023, and assigned to
Department 68 on June 7, 2023. 
 
On
October 11, 2023, the court sustained the demurrer to the first amended
complaint brought by MS International, Inc. to the fourth cause of action with
20 days leave to amend. On October 18, 2023, the court overruled the demurrer
to the fourth cause of action brought by M S International, Inc. On November 2,
2023, Caesarstone USA, Inc. filed a cross-complaint for indemnity, declaratory
relief and apportionment. On December 29, 2023, Lowes Home Centers, LLC filed a
cross-complaint indemnity, declaratory relief and apportionment.
 
On
September 5, 2024, the court granted the motion for trial preference based on
the age of Rebecca Garcia at the time of the filing of the motion.

Defendant
Caesarstone USA, Inc. (Caesarstone USA) moves for summary judgment on the
entire complaint, and alternatively, summary adjudication on the entire
complaint, and the claim for punitive damages. Caesarstone USA moves on multiple
grounds, including: Lack of evidence establishing exposure, causation, and any
malice, oppression, or fraud; and affirmative evidence establishing
non-exposure and lack of privity. Plaintiffs in opposition challenge the motion
on grounds that Caesarstone USA fails to shift the burden of proof, due to the
lack of sufficient competent evidence, and contends they provide affirmative
evidence of exposure, causation, and corporate knowledge. 
 
The pleadings frame the issues for motions, “since it is those
allegations to which the motion must respond. (Citation.)” (Scolinos v. Kolts (1995) 37 Cal. App.
4th 635, 640-641; FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima
(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 382-383; Jordan-Lyon
Prods., LTD. v. Cineplex Odeon Corp. (1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1459, 1472.)
The purpose of a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication “is to
provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order
to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to
resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atl.
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.)  “Code of Civil Procedure section 437c,
subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the
evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’
and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.”  (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)  
 
“On a motion for summary judgment, the initial burden is
always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no
triable issues of material fact.” (Scalf
v. D.B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) A defendant
moving for summary judgment “has met his or her burden of showing that a cause
of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the
cause of action . . . cannot be established.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) “Once the defendant . . . has
met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a
triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or
a defense thereto.” (Ibid.) 
 
A defendant may alternatively move for summary judgment on
grounds that Plaintiff lacks
sufficient evidence, and cannot reasonably obtain necessary evidence in support
of the claims.¿(Aguilar v. Atl.
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th at pp. 854-855; Collin
v. CalPortland Co. (2014)
228 Cal.App.4th 582, 587; Andrews v. Foster Wheeler LLC (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 96, 101; Union Bank v. Superior Court (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 573, 590.) The
court adheres to this standard for product liability cases, such as asbestos
and crystalline silica (e.g. latent exposure leading to mesothelioma or
silicosis).
 
“When deciding whether to grant summary judgment, the court
must consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers (except evidence to
which the court has sustained an objection), as well as all reasonable
inference that may be drawn form that evidence, in the light most favorable to
the party opposing summary judgment.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159
Cal.App.4th 463, 467; see also Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).) “An
issue of fact can only be created by a conflict in the evidence.  It is not created by speculation, conjecture,
imagination or guesswork.”  (Lyons v. Security Pacific National Bank
(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1001, 1041 (citation omitted).)
 
Caesarstone USA relies on denial of any supply, manufacture
or distribution of silica containing products utilized by Decedent, while
employed as a fabricator. The position relies on a challenge to Plaintiffs’
evidence by way of devoid discovery responses, and Defendant offers the
deposition testimony of Decedent’s co-worker Domingo Ojeda-Alverdin and the declaration
of its Corporate Support Manager Keuana Lillard. 
 
The court finds the subject matter analogous to
asbestos litigation on the basis of latent injury caused by a dangerous
product, and therefore applies the substantial factor standard in the subject
action. (Lineaweaver v. Plant Insulation
Company (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1409, 1415, 1419.) “In the context of a cause
of action for asbestos-related latent injuries, the plaintiff must first
establish some threshold exposure to the
defendant's defective asbestos-containing products, and must further establish in reasonable medical probability
that a particular exposure or series of exposures was a “legal cause” of his
injury, i.e., a substantial factor in bringing
about the injury. In an asbestos-related cancer case, the plaintiff need not prove that fibers from the defendant's product were the
ones, or among the ones, that actually began the process of malignant cellular
growth. Instead, the plaintiff may meet the burden of proving that exposure to
defendant's product was a substantial factor causing the illness by showing
that in reasonable medical probability it contributed to the plaintiff or
decedent's risk of developing
cancer.” Rutherford v. Owens-Illinois,
Inc. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 953, 982. “[W]e conclude that the proper
analysis is to ask whether the plaintiff has proven exposure to a defendant's
product, of whatever duration, so that exposure is a possible factor in causing
the disease and then to evaluate whether the exposure was a substantial
factor.”  (Lineaweaver v. Plant Insulation Company, supra, 31
Cal.App.4th at p. 1416.)  Exposure by a
contributing party, among many, is sufficient to establish triable issues of
material fact.  The calculation of the
probabilities of whether even limited exposure constituted a substantial factor
is more appropriately addressed before the trial court.  (Id.
at pp. 1417-1419.)
 
“In the
context of a cause of action for asbestos-related latent injuries, the
plaintiff must first establish some threshold exposure to the
defendant's defective [] products, and must further
establish in reasonable medical probability that a particular exposure or
series of exposures was a ‘legal cause’ of his injury, i.e., a substantial
factor in bringing about the injury. In a[] [silicosis] case, the
plaintiff need not prove that [particulate]
from the defendant's product were the ones, or among the ones, that actually
began the process of malignant cellular growth. Instead, the plaintiff may meet
the burden of proving that exposure to defendant's product was a substantial
factor causing the illness by showing that in reasonable medical probability it
contributed to the plaintiff or decedent's risk of developing
[silicosis].” (Rutherford v. Owens-Illinois,
Inc. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 953, 982.)
 
Other than citation to discovery responses regarding
the basis of the complaint, including the performance of stone fabrication work
without sufficient protective equipment, the court finds no substantive basis
for the challenge to the insufficiency of evidence by Plaintiffs regarding the
placement of Caesarstone USA manufactured and/or distributed silica containing
artificial stone products on the premises of any and all of Decedent’s
employers during the relevant exposure period. [See Declaration of Brian L.
King, Compendium of Evidence.] The conclusive argument and reliance on denial
of sufficient evidence fails to shift the burden. (See McGonnell v. Kaiser Gypsum Co., Inc. (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1103-1104; Scheiding v. Dinwiddie Const. Co. (1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 64, 81.) 
 
Further,
the deposition testimony of Decedent’s co-worker Domingo Ojeda-Alverdin and the
declaration of its Corporate Support Manager Keuana Lillard are equally
insufficient to shift the burden. The deposition testimony of Ojeda-Alverdin does
not negate exposure or causation and he admittedly identifies Caesarstone slabs
as ones he worked with, though Caesarstone USA makes a vague claim that it may
be counterfeit without any factual or legal address. Likewise, the declaration
of Lillard does not state that Caesarstone USA never manufactured in the
United States, and otherwise only presents evidence that there are no records
of direct sale to Decedent’s places of work. 
 
The court alternatively finds triable issues of material
fact based on the presence of Caesarstone vehicles and products on the premises
of Decedent’s place of employment during the relevant time period, records and
correspondence of sale involving Caesarstone, and evidence of manufacturing the
product. Plaintiffs present possibly admissible testimony identifying Caesarstone
vehicles and products for Bernadino’s shop, and invoices and sales of Caesarstone
slabs to Bernadino’s shops. [Declaration of Brian P. Barrow: Deposition Testimony
of Cesar Quiroz, 60:13-20, 164:14-165:2, 268:6-15; 269:8-12, 626:24-627:3;
Declaration of Simonetta Marshall, Exh. A.] Plaintiffs also present evidence
that Caesarstone USA had a manufacturing plant in Georgia from 2015 through January
of 2024 based on news articles. [Declaration of Brian P. Barrow, Exhs. 1-2.] The
exposure to said silica containing stone products caused exposure and led to
the silicosis diagnosis and death. [Declaration of Kenneth
Rosenman.]
 
As to Caesarstone USA’s lack of privity argument regarding
the claim for breach of implied warranty, Plaintiffs correctly cite to Peterson
v. Lamb Lumber Co. (1960) 54 Cal.2d 339, 347-348, where our Supreme Court
held that for purposes of breach of implied warranty liability, a worker who is
injured in the course of his work by a defective product purchased by his hirer
is in privity with both the manufacturer and the supplier of the product. 
 
Therefore, the motion for summary judgment and motion for
summary adjudication reliant on the absence of sufficient exposure, causation,
and privity is therefore DENIED. 
 
On Fraudulent Concealment, Caesarstone USA challenges the
lack of any basis of duty to disclose any specific potential harms from the
product(s). Caesarstone USA argues that Decedent did not have a fiduciary or
direct transactional relationship with it, thus foreclosing any duty to
disclose. Caesarstone USA relies on the deposition testimony of Ojeda-Alverdin,
who testified that the stone slabs used at Bernardino Sanchez’s shop were
purchased by the property owner and that the slabs used in the shop were provided
by third-party contractors “Pocholo” and “El Poblano” or “Puebla.” [Compendium
of Evidence, Ojeda-Alverdin Deposition Transcript.] Thus, it argues that there
is no evidence that Decedent, who worked as a fabricator, purchased Caesarstone
USA slabs himself or was in any way involved in ordering slabs on behalf of his
employers. Defendant also relies on the declaration of Lillard, who provides
that Caesarstone USA has no record of selling its products directly to
Decedent’s employers. [Declaration of Keuana Lillard, ¶¶4-6.]
 
In opposition, Plaintiffs argue that Defendant failed to
shift the burden and challenge the evidence presented. Plaintiffs further
contend that Caesarstone USA remains liable because the Hazard Communication
Standard imposed a duty on it to fully disclose the lethal hazards of its
product by affixing hazard warning labels and use instructions to its
artificial stone slabs and by providing safety data sheets to those purchasing
the product, as well as under common law. Plaintiffs also provide possibly
admissible evidence of Caesarstone USA’s CEO Arik Tendler’s knowledge of
silicosis cases against it, a failure to investigate silicosis, a lack of
proper warnings despite knowledge that silica can be hazardous to health, and
policies Caesarstone put in place in Isreal during the manufacturing. [Declaration of Brian P. Barrow, Exh. 7, Deposition Testimony of Arik Tendler.] However, Plaintiffs have yet to show this former testimony
is admissible under any hearsay exception.
 
“[T]he
elements of a cause of action for fraud based on concealment are: ‘(1) the
defendant must have concealed or suppressed a material fact, (2) the defendant
must have been under a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3) the
defendant must have intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the
intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have been unaware of
the fact and would not have acted as he did if he had known of the concealed or
suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of the concealment or suppression of the
fact, the plaintiff must have sustained damage. [Citation.]’” (Kaldenbach v.
Mutual of Omaha Life Ins. Co. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 830, 850 (internal
quotation marks omitted.) 
 
“There are ‘four
circumstances in which nondisclosure or concealment may constitute actionable
fraud: (1) when the defendant is in a fiduciary relationship with the
plaintiff; (2) when the defendant had exclusive knowledge of material facts not
known to the plaintiff; (3) when the defendant actively conceals a material
fact from the plaintiff; and (4) when the defendant makes partial
representations but also suppresses some material facts. [Citation.]’” (LiMandri v. Judkins (1997) 52
Cal.App.4th 326, 336.) “Each of the other three circumstances in which
nondisclosure may be actionable presupposes the existence of some other
relationship between the plaintiff and defendant in which a duty to disclose
can arise. … As a matter of common sense, such a relationship can only come
into being as a result of some sort of transaction between the parties.” (Id. at pp. 336–337.) 
 
The court notes the standard for certain types of
product potentially applicable, and considered in a demurrer on the subject
cause of action brought by a different co-defendant. “The requirement's purpose is to inform consumers about a
product's hazards and faults of which they are unaware, so that they can
refrain from using the product altogether or evade the danger by careful use.”
(Jones v. ConocoPhillips Co. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 1187, 1198.) Users
include persons responsible for processing materials not privy to information
regarding necessary safety protocols. The withholding of said information
subjects a defendant to potential fraudulent concealment liability. (Id.
at pp. 1199-1200.)
 
Paragraphs 541 through 547 of the operative
complaint present allegations regarding knowledge of the allegedly toxic
substance, crystalline silica, dangers to workers engaged in the cutting,
grinding, fabrication, polishing, etc. with the product, and failure to
disclose potential toxicity upon working with said products. Decedent was
specifically exposed and harmed as a result of the non-disclosed hazards and
continued work with the supplied product. [First Amend. Comp., ¶¶ 535-564.] The
allegations meet the standard for fraudulent concealment. (Bockrath v. Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc.
(1999) 21 Cal.4th 71, 78-79.)
 
Under the consideration for product liability summary judgment,
the court finds insufficient address of this standard by Caesarstone USA for
purposes of shifting the burden. Further, as discussed in the prior part of the
order, the court finds the evidence presented by Caesarstone USA to be
insufficient as well. The court therefore denies the motion for summary
adjudication on the failure to shift the burden, and notes there may be triable
issues of material fact regarding failure to warn on allegedly known hazards
caused by fabrication of products containing silica depending on the
admissibility of Plaintiffs’ evidence. [Declaration of Brian P. Barrow, Exh. 7,
Deposition Testimony of Arik Tendler.]
 
On punitive damages, Caesarstone USA challenges the sufficiency
against the corporate entity. Caesarstone USA generally states that Plaintiffs
have no evidence to support this claim and relies on the same arguments made
for the fraud cause of action. Plaintiffs’ opposition lacks much legal address
as well.
 
On punitive damages, Civil
Code section 3294, subdivision (c) authorizes punitive damages upon a showing
of malice, oppression, or fraud, which are defined as follows:
 
(1) “Malice” means
conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or
despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and
conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.
(2) “Oppression”
means despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in
conscious disregard of that person’s rights.
(3) “Fraud” means an
intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact known
to the defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby
depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.
 
“‘[M]alice does not require actual
intent to harm. [Citation.] Conscious disregard for the safety of another may
be sufficient where the defendant is aware of the probable dangerous
consequences of his or her conduct and he or she willfully fails to avoid such
consequences. [Citation.] Malice may be proved either expressly through direct
evidence or by implication through indirect evidence from which the jury draws
inferences.’ [Citations.]”  (Pfeifer
v. John Crane, Inc. (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 1270, 1299.) 
 
Consistent with the prior part of the order, the
court again finds the motion insufficiently addresses the evidence presented by
Plaintiffs regarding the knowing distribution of the silica containing product,
including corporate knowledge and direction for the manufacture and
distribution of an allegedly harmful product. Further, Caesarstone USA presents
no actual evidence in support of its contentions, only generally points to an
absence of evidence without much address, and relies on its arguments regarding
the fraud cause of action which fail as discussed above. [Compendium of
Evidence, Responses to Specially Drafted Interrogatories and Requests for
Production of Documents.] The court additionally notes there may be
triable issues of material fact on the basis of knowledge, ratification, and
malice depending on the admissibility of Plaintiffs’ evidence. [Declaration of Brian P. Barrow, Exh. 7, Deposition Testimony of
Arik Tendler.] (White
v. Ultramar, Inc. (1999) 21 Cal.4th 563, 576–577; Cruz v. HomeBase (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th
160, 168.) The
motion for summary adjudication is therefore denied in its entirety. 
 
In summary, the court denies the motion for summary judgment
and summary adjudication.

Objections to the former Deposition Testimony of Arik Tendler: Sustained, but
parties may argue the applicability of Evidence Code §§ 1291-1292 as Plaintiffs

Caesarstone Ltd. moves for summary adjudication on the fourth cause of action
for fraudulent concealment, and the claim for punitive damages. Caesarstone Ltd.
moves on grounds that it did not directly transact with Decedent and Plaintiffs
have no evidence of officers, directors, or managing agents acting with malice,
fraud or oppression. Plaintiffs in opposition challenge the motion on grounds
that Caesarstone Ltd. fails to shift the burden of proof, due to the lack of
sufficient competent evidence and a failure to establish Plaintiff lacks
sufficient evidence to prevail, and based on additional evidence of corporate
knowledge.  The pleadings frame the issues for motions, “since it is those
allegations to which the motion must respond. (Citation.)”  (Scolinos
v. Kolts (1995) 37 Cal. App. 4th 635, 640-641; FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 382-383; Jordan-Lyon Prods., LTD. v. Cineplex Odeon Corp. (1994) 29
Cal.App.4th 1459, 1472.) The purpose of a motion for summary judgment or
summary adjudication “is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’
pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in
fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar
v. Atl. Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.)  “Code of Civil Procedure section 437c,
subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the
evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’
and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.”  (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)   “On a motion for summary judgment, the initial burden is
always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no
triable issues of material fact.” (Scalf
v. D.B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) A defendant
moving for summary judgment “has met his or her burden of showing that a cause
of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the

(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) “Once the defendant . . . has

grounds that Plaintiff lacks
sufficient evidence, and cannot reasonably obtain necessary evidence in support
of the claims.¿(Aguilar v. Atl.

855Union Bank v. Superior Court (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 573, 590.) The
court adheres to this standard for product liability cases, such as asbestos
and crystalline silica (e.g. latent exposure leading to mesothelioma or
silicosis). “When deciding whether to grant summary judgment, the court
must consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers (except evidence to
which the court has sustained an objection), as well as all reasonable
inference that may be drawn form that evidence, in the light most favorable to

Ltd. challenges the lack of any basis of duty to disclose any specific
potential harms from the product(s). Caesarstone Ltd. argues that Decedent did
not have a fiduciary or direct transactional relationship with it, thus
foreclosing any duty to disclose. Caesarstone Ltd. relies on the deposition
testimony of Decedent’s coworker, Domingo Ojeda-Alverdin, who testified that
the stone slabs used at Bernardino Sanchez’s shop were purchased by the
property owner and that the slabs used in the shop were provided by third-party
contractors “Pocholo” and “El Poblano” or “Puebla.” [Compendium of Evidence, Ojeda-Alverdin
Deposition Transcript.] Thus, Caesarstone Ltd. argues that there is no evidence
that Decedent, who worked as a fabricator, purchased Caesarstone Ltd. slabs
himself or was in any way involved in ordering slabs on behalf of his
employers. Defendant also relies on the Declaration of its Database
Administrator, Barak Cohavi, who provides that Caesarstone Ltd. has no record
of selling its products directly to Decedent’s employers. [Declaration of Barak
Cohavi, ¶¶4-5.] In opposition, Plaintiffs
argue that Defendant failed to shift the burden and challenge the Cohavi
declaration. Plaintiffs further contend that Caesarstone Ltd. established its
domestic subsidiary, Caesarstone USA, Inc., to market and sell its product
throughout the United States. Caesarstone USA’s “Sun Valley Distribution
Center” was located at 11312 Penrose Street in Sun Valley - just 0.3 miles from
the Bernardino Sanchez fabrication shop where decedent worked. The mere fact
that Caesarstone Ltd. (the Israeli company) had no “direct” dealings with
Decedent or his hirer is immaterial to whether it may be liable for fraudulent
concealment. Caesarstone Ltd. remains liable because the Hazard Communication
Standard imposed a duty on it to fully disclose the lethal hazards of its
product by affixing hazard warning labels and use instructions to its
artificial stone slabs and by providing safety data sheets to those purchasing
the product. Plaintiffs also provide possibly admissible evidence of Caesarstone
USA’s CEO Arik Tendler’s knowledge of silicosis cases against it, a failure to
investigate silicosis, a lack of proper warnings despite knowledge that silica
can be hazardous to health, and policies Caesarstone put in place in Isreal during
the manufacturing. [Declaration of Brian P. Barrow,

admissible under any hearsay exception. “[T]he elements of

existence of some other relationship between the plaintiff and defendant in
which a duty to disclose can arise. … As a matter of common sense, such a
relationship can only come into being as a result of some sort of transaction
between the parties.” (Id. at pp.
336–337.)  The court
notes the standard for certain types of product potentially applicable, and
considered in a demurrer on the subject cause of action brought by a different
co-defendant. “The requirement's purpose is to inform consumers about a
product's hazards and faults of which they are unaware, so that they can
refrain from using the product altogether or evade the danger by careful use.”
(Jones v. ConocoPhillips Co. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 1187, 1198.) Users
include persons responsible for processing materials not privy to information
regarding necessary safety protocols. The withholding of said information
subjects a defendant to potential fraudulent concealment liability. (Id.
at pp. 1199-1200.) Paragraphs 541
through 547 of the operative complaint present allegations regarding knowledge
of the allegedly toxic substance, crystalline silica, dangers to workers
engaged in the cutting, grinding, fabrication, polishing, etc. with the
product, and failure to disclose potential toxicity upon working with said
products. Decedent was specifically exposed and harmed as a result of the
non-disclosed hazards and continued work with the supplied product. [First
Amend. Comp., ¶¶ 535-564.] The allegations meet the standard for fraudulent
concealment. (Bockrath
v. Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc.
(1999) 21 Cal.4th 71, 78-79.) Under
the consideration for product liability summary judgment, the court finds
insufficient address of this standard by Caesarstone Ltd. for purposes of
shifting the burden. Further, the court finds the evidence presented by
Caesarstone Ltd. to be insufficient as well, and Caesarstone points to no
absence of evidence such as devoid discovery responses except for improperly in
its reply. The court therefore denies the motion for summary adjudication on
the failure to shift the burden, and notes that there may be triable issues of
material regarding failure to warn on allegedly known hazards caused by
fabrication of products containing silica. [Declaration of Brian P. Barrow,
Exh. 1.] On
punitive damages, Caesarstone Ltd. challenges the sufficiency against the
corporate entity. Caesarstone Ltd. generally states that Plaintiffs have no
evidence to support this claim and relies on the same arguments made for the fraud
cause of action. Plaintiffs’ opposition lacks much legal address as well. On punitive damages, Civil Code section 3294,
subdivision (c) authorizes punitive damages upon a showing of malice,
oppression, or fraud, which are defined
as follows: (1) “Malice” means conduct which is intended
by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct which
is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the
rights or safety of others.(2) “Oppression” means despicable conduct
that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of
that person’s rights.(3) “Fraud” means an intentional
misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact known to the
defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby depriving
a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury. “‘[M]alice does not require actual intent to harm.
[Citation.] Conscious disregard for the safety of another may be sufficient
where the defendant is aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his or
her conduct and he or she willfully fails to avoid such consequences.
[Citation.] Malice may be proved either expressly through direct evidence or by
implication through indirect evidence from which the jury draws inferences.’
[Citations.]”  (Pfeifer v. John Crane,
Inc. (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 1270, 1299.)  Consistent with the prior part of the order, the court again finds that Caesarstone
Ltd. presents insufficient evidence in support of its contentions, does not
point to any absence of evidence such as devoid discovery responses except for
improperly in its reply, and relies on its arguments regarding the fraud cause
of action which fail as discussed above. The court additionally notes there may
be triable issues of material fact on the basis of knowledge, ratification, and
malice. [Declaration
of Brian P. Barrow, Exh. 1.] (White v. Ultramar, Inc. (1999) 21 Cal.4th 563, 576–577; Cruz
v. HomeBase (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 160, 168.) The motion for summary adjudication is therefore
denied in its entirety.  In summary, the
court denies the motion for summary adjudication. Caesarstone Ltd. to

SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Wendy
Viridinia Solano-Castro, et al. alleges the wrongful death of Raul Garcia-Leon
caused from as a stone fabricator and installer. Plaintiffs contend working
with “toxic” stone products led to the development of silicosis and death of
Garcia-Leon on February 16, 2023.
 
On
May 22, 2023, Plaintiff filed a 582 paragraph complaint for negligence, strict
liability – warning defect, strict liability – design defect, fraudulent
concealment, and breach of implied warranties. On May 31, 2023, Plaintiff a 235
page first amended complaint for negligence, strict liability – warning defect,
strict liability – design defect, fraudulent concealment, and breach of implied
warranties. The action names a multitude of parties comprised of suppliers,
sellers, etc. The case was deemed non-complex on June 5, 2023, and assigned to
Department 68 on June 7, 2023. 
 
On
October 11, 2023, the court sustained the demurrer to the first amended
complaint brought by MS International, Inc. to the fourth cause of action with
20 days leave to amend. On October 18, 2023, the court overruled the demurrer
to the fourth cause of action brought by M S International, Inc. On November 2,
2023, Caesarstone USA, Inc. filed a cross-complaint for indemnity, declaratory
relief and apportionment. On December 29, 2023, Lowes Home Centers, LLC filed a
cross-complaint indemnity, declaratory relief and apportionment.
 
On
September 5, 2024, the court granted the motion for trial preference based on
the age of Rebecca Garcia at the time of the filing of the motion.

Defendant
Paragon Industries, Inc. (Paragon) moves for summary judgment on the entire
complaint, and alternatively, summary adjudication on the entire complaint, and
the claim for punitive damages. Paragon moves on multiple grounds, including:
Lack of evidence establishing causation, superseding intervention, the Federal
Hazards Communications Act, and sophisticated intermediary/user doctrine. Plaintiffs
in opposition challenge the motion on grounds that Paragon fails to shift the
burden of proof on ground of insufficient competent evidence, denial of
application of the sophisticated user defense, and challenges any defense to
fraudulent concealment or the punitive damages claim. Paragon in an extensive reply
maintains it shifted the burden of proof based on both direct evidence and an
absence of evidence, and denies the existence of any triable issues of material
fact. Paragon disregards whether Decedent was employed by Sanchez or not, and
reiterates intervening cause as a complete defense. Paragon contends Decedent
misused the product, which “destroys” causation. Paragon next restates the
sophisticated intermediary defense based on a assumed obligation to become
aware of the hazards by Sanchez. Paragon more substantively addresses the
Hazard Communication Act standard, but seeks to establish a defense, again, based
on the failure of Sanchez to provide protective equipment. On Fraudulent
Concealment, Paragon reiterates the claimed lack of evidence regarding the sale
of silica containing slabs to Sanchez, and safety sheets were attached
regardless. Paragon also addresses “direct dealings” but this time outside the
context of the fraudulent concealment claim. Within this thread, Paragon follows
with new argument on the breach of warranty claim on the basis of lack of
privity between Paragon and Decedent. Finally, Paragon challenges the
sufficiency of the evidence on the punitive damages claim.
 
The pleadings frame the issues for motions, “since it is those
allegations to which the motion must respond. (Citation.)” (Scolinos v. Kolts (1995) 37 Cal. App.
4th 635, 640-641; FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima
(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 382-383; Jordan-Lyon
Prods., LTD. v. Cineplex Odeon Corp. (1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1459, 1472.)
The purpose of a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication “is to
provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order
to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to
resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atl.
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) 
“Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), requires the
trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all
inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other
inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material
fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of
law.”  (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110,
1119.)  
 
“On a motion for summary judgment, the initial burden is
always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no
triable issues of material fact.” (Scalf
v. D.B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) A defendant
moving for summary judgment “has met his or her burden of showing that a cause
of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the
cause of action . . . cannot be established.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) “Once the defendant . . . has
met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a
triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or
a defense thereto.” (Ibid.) 
 
A defendant may alternatively move for summary judgment on
grounds that Plaintiff lacks
sufficient evidence, and cannot reasonably obtain necessary evidence in support
of the claims.¿(Aguilar v. Atl.
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th at pp. 854-855; Collin
v. CalPortland Co. (2014)
228 Cal.App.4th 582, 587; Andrews v. Foster Wheeler LLC (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 96, 101; Union Bank v. Superior Court (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 573, 590.) The
court adheres to this standard for product liability cases, such as asbestos
and crystalline silica (e.g. latent exposure leading to mesothelioma or
silicosis).
 
“When deciding whether to grant summary judgment, the court
must consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers (except evidence to
which the court has sustained an objection), as well as all reasonable
inference that may be drawn form that evidence, in the light most favorable to
the party opposing summary judgment.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159
Cal.App.4th 463, 467; see also Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).) “An
issue of fact can only be created by a conflict in the evidence.  It is not created by speculation, conjecture,
imagination or guesswork.”  (Lyons v. Security Pacific National Bank
(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1001, 1041 (citation omitted).)
 
The court finds the subject matter analogous to
asbestos litigation on the basis of latent injury caused by a dangerous
product, and therefore applies the substantial factor standard in the subject
action. (Lineaweaver v. Plant Insulation
Company (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1409, 1415, 1419.) “In the context of a cause
of action for asbestos-related latent injuries, the plaintiff must first
establish some threshold exposure to the
defendant's defective asbestos-containing products, and must further establish in reasonable medical probability
that a particular exposure or series of exposures was a “legal cause” of his injury,
i.e., a substantial factor in bringing
about the injury. In an asbestos-related cancer case, the plaintiff need not prove that fibers from the defendant's product were the
ones, or among the ones, that actually began the process of malignant cellular
growth. Instead, the plaintiff may meet the burden of proving that exposure to
defendant's product was a substantial factor causing the illness by showing
that in reasonable medical probability it contributed to the plaintiff or
decedent's risk of developing
cancer.” Rutherford v. Owens-Illinois,
Inc. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 953, 982. “[W]e conclude that the proper
analysis is to ask whether the plaintiff has proven exposure to a defendant's
product, of whatever duration, so that exposure is a possible factor in causing
the disease and then to evaluate whether the exposure was a substantial
factor.”  (Lineaweaver v. Plant Insulation Company, supra, 31
Cal.App.4th at p. 1416.)  Exposure by a
contributing party, among many, is sufficient to establish triable issues of
material fact.  The calculation of the
probabilities of whether even limited exposure constituted a substantial factor
is more appropriately addressed before the trial court.  (Id.
at pp. 1417-1419.)
 
“In the
context of a cause of action for [silica]-related latent injuries, the
plaintiff must first establish some threshold exposure to the
defendant's defective [] products, and must further
establish in reasonable medical probability that a particular exposure or
series of exposures was a ‘legal cause’ of his injury, i.e., a substantial
factor in bringing about the injury. In a[] [silicosis] case, the
plaintiff need not prove that [particulate]
from the defendant's product were the ones, or among the ones, that actually
began the process of malignant cellular growth. Instead, the plaintiff may meet
the burden of proving that exposure to defendant's product was a substantial
factor causing the illness by showing that in reasonable medical probability it
contributed to the plaintiff or decedent's risk of developing
[silicosis].” (Rutherford v. Owens-Illinois,
Inc. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 953, 982.)
 
Paragon relies on denial of any supply, manufacture or
distribution of silica containing products utilized by Decedent, while employed
as a fabricator. The position relies entirely on a challenge to Plaintiffs’
evidence, and otherwise offers no counter evidence refuting the allegation that
Paragon engaged in the manufacture/supply/distribution of silica containing
artificial stone products.
 
Other than citation to discovery responses regarding
the basis of the complaint, including the performance of stone fabrication work
without sufficient protective equipment, the court finds no substantive basis
for the challenge to the insufficiency of evidence by Plaintiffs regarding the
placement of Paragon manufactured and/or distributed silica containing
artificial stone products on the premises of any and all of Decedent’s
employers during the relevant exposure period. [See Declaration of John
McMahon, Index of Exhibits.] Plaintiffs present pages and pages of factually
detailed discovery regarding the claim for exposure. The conclusive argument
and reliance on denial of sufficient evidence fails to shift the burden. (McGonnell v. Kaiser Gypsum Co., Inc. (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1103-1104; Scheiding v. Dinwiddie Const. Co. (1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 64, 81.) 
 
The court alternatively finds triable issues of material
fact based on the presence of silica containing Paragon products identified at
least in part as Revera and Sequel, and acquired at Bedrosians. The affiliation
with Bedrosians and Paragon remains undisputed. [Declaration of Scott Brust:
Deposition of Cesar Quiroz, 870:23-874:19; see Declaration of Eric Jessen.] The
exposure to said silica containing stone products caused exposure and led to the
silicosis diagnosis and death. [Declaration of Kenneth Rosenman.]
 
The motion for summary judgment and motion for
summary adjudication reliant on the absence of sufficient causation is
therefore DENIED. (McGonnell v. Kaiser Gypsum Co.,
Inc.,
supra, 98 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1103-1104; Scheiding v. Dinwiddie Const. Co., supra, 69 Cal.App.4th 64, 81.)
 
Paragon next contends superseding conduct intervenes any
causation claims. The position relies on deposition testimony whereby a
co-employee admittedly removed warning labels placed on artificial stone slabs
present on the premises of employer Bernadino Sanchez, and said employer failed
to provide adequate respiratory protection equipment. Paragon maintains it
complied with federal regulations requiring the labeling of hazardous products.
Plaintiffs in opposition counters that Bernadino Sanchez was never an employer
of Decedent, and was therefore not obligated to provide safety equipment.
Sanchez also denies ever seeing any material data safety sheets or otherwise
understanding the warning labels on the slabs in terms of silica hazards.
Plaintiffs also represent triable issues of material fact exist on the defense
based on “misuse” doctrine. 
 
Superseding causation constitutes an exception to
reliance on substantial factor causation. (Ash
v. North American Title Co. (2014) 223
Cal.App.4th 1258, 1277 accord Soule v. General Motors Corp. (1994) 8 Cal.4th 548, 573 (footnote 9) [“This principle is
distinct from the defense of ‘superseding cause,’ which absolves a tortfeasor,
even though his conduct was a substantial
contributing factor, when an independent event intervenes in the chain of
causation, producing harm of a kind and degree so far beyond the risk the
original tortfeasor should have foreseen that the law deems it unfair to hold
him responsible”].
 
“The use
of the terms ‘superseding’ or ‘superseding cause’ in these opinions should not
be confused with the doctrine of superseding cause which relieves an actor of
liability notwithstanding that the actor was a cause in fact of the injury for
which recompense was sought. ‘A
superseding cause is an act of a third person or other force which by its
intervention prevents the actor from being liable for harm to another which his
antecedent negligence is a substantial factor in bringing about.’ (Rest.2d Torts, § 440.)
In California the doctrine requires more than mere negligence on the part of
the intervening actor. ‘[T]he fact that an intervening act of a third person is
done in a negligent manner does not make it a superseding cause if a reasonable
man knowing the situation existing when the act of the third person is done
would not regard it as highly extraordinary that the third person so acted or
the act is a normal response to a situation created by the defendant's conduct
and the manner in which the intervening act is done is not extraordinarily
negligent.’” (Doupnik v.
General Motors Corp. (1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 849, 862-863.)
 
The motion itself
lacks specific address of the standard, and simply cites on the existence of
federal regulations regarding disclosure requirements, and deposition testimony
regarding the removal of warning labels. The court declines to make the
arguments for the Federal Hazards Communications Act simply based on
citation to federal regulations and reiteration in reply. As further discussed
below, the court also finds to the extent the position relies on deflecting
responsibility for placement of silica containing stone products into commerce
to Sanchez for removal of the safety tags, the court finds no legal support for
the Federal Hazards Communication Act defense on this basis. 
 
The removal of
warning labels from slabs and failure to provide allegedly provided safety
sheets to stone fabricators on the premises (challenged by Sanchez) otherwise
insufficiently establishes any extraordinary negligence or otherwise altered
the foreseeability of harm caused by the stone cutting operations. Paragon
first and foremost relies on discovery propounded by Surface Warehouse, and
other cases, which the court will not consider for purposes of the subject
motion. [Declaration of John MacMahon ¶¶ 3-8, Index of Exhibits, Ex. 3-7:
Responses to Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories.] Of the reviewed,
admissible evidence, the court finds insufficient consideration of the standard
presented. (Doupnik v.
General Motors Corp., supra,
225 Cal.App.3d at pp. 862-863.) 
 
With the
exception of the removal of certain alleged warning literature and stickers, the
deposition testimony only addresses the workplace conditions rather than any
consideration of the alleged superseding conduct. [MacMahon Decl., ¶¶ 9-11, Ex.
8-9: Deposition of Domingo Ojeda-Alvedrin and Cesar Gonzalez-Quiroz.] Again, the
court finds mere citation to federal regulation standards insufficiently
establishes a basis for relief under the Federal Hazards Communications
Act or superseding causation. Even if Paragon shifted
the burden, court finds triable issues of material fact on the issue of
reasonableness in the alleged conduct, including under the guise of federal
regulations and the existence of any employment relationship between Sanchez
and Decedent. [Id.; Declaration of Scott Brust: Deposition of Cesar
Quiroz.]
 
On the third ground, Paragon challenges the action under sophisticated/intermediate
user. The court reviews the standard. “In general, a
manufacturer or supplier has a duty to warn consumers about the dangers and
risks inherent in the use of its product. (Citations.) The
sophisticated user defense is an
exception to the general duty to warn. (Citation.) The defense
concerns warnings and does not apply to a cause of action for design defect. (Citation.) ...
[¶] Under the sophisticated user defense, a manufacturer is not liable to a
sophisticated user of its product for failure to warn about the product's
dangers if the sophisticated user knew or should have known of the dangers. (Citation.)
The ‘should have known’ portion of the formulation is an objective standard. (Citation.) ...
The rationale supporting the defense is that the failure to warn about risks
already known to a sophisticated user usually is not a proximate cause of the
user's injuries. (Citation.)” (Collin v. CalPortland Co. (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th at pp. 601–602.)
 
Paragon relies on the “obvious danger” standard within the
sophisticated user defense: “The obvious danger rule is an objective test, and the
courts do not inquire into the user's subjective knowledge in such a case. In
other words, even if a user was truly unaware of a product's hazards, that fact
is irrelevant if the danger was objectively obvious. ...  Thus, under the sophisticated user defense,
the inquiry focuses on whether the plaintiff knew, or should have known, of the
particular risk of harm from the product giving rise to the injury.” (Johnson v. American Standard, Inc. (2008) 43 Cal.4th 56, 71.) 
 
While the danger of silica dust
finds medical support (See Declaration of Kenneth Rosenman), Paragon relies on
Decedent’s “experience” as a fabricator to comprehend the medical dangers of silica
dust caused by the cutting of artificial stone. The argument provides no
evidentiary support establishing the “obvious” nature of such an injury. The
reply also appears to mutate the position in the motion as pivoting to
“misuse,” which the court finds factually and legally unsupported. The court,
again, will not consider unmade, or perhaps even new legal argument raised in
the reply. The court declines to find as a matter of law that such a danger
exists for purposes of ruling on the motion. The court therefore finds Paragon,
again, fails to shift the burden. (See McGonnell
v. Kaiser Gypsum Co., Inc., supra,
98 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1103-1104; Scheiding
v. Dinwiddie Const. Co., supra, 69
Cal.App.4th at p. 81.)
 
To the extent Paragon appears to offer a sophisticated
intermediary defense, the court again finds no support based on an assumption
the known hazard of silica particulate matter from stone fabrication. Other
than citation to the public policy and reliance on self-awareness of the
hazards, the motion again lacks legal support actually addressing the standard.
The court also finds no legal or evidentiary support based on reliance and
deflection under uncited OSHA and Cal OSHA standards. (Webb v. Special Electric Co., Inc. (2016) 63 Cal.4th 167, 187-188.) 
 
The court therefore DENIES the
motion for summary judgment based on the failure to establish both insufficient
evidence or a complete defense on this basis. Plaintiff additionally
establishes triable issues of material fact on the known hazards of silica
particulate matter resulting from fabrication. [Rosenman and Burrows Decl.] 
 
On the summary adjudication, to
the extent Paragon relies on the lack of causation regarding proof of Paragon
products in the presence of Decedent, and superseding conduct, the court denies
the motion for summary adjudication as to the first, third, fourth, and fifth
causes of action. 
 
On the fraudulent concealment
cause of action, Paragon additionally challenges the lack of any basis
of duty to disclose any specific potential harms from the failure to warn.
Paragon relies exclusively on the lack of any duty to disclose due to the
absence of any fiduciary duty. “[T]he elements of a cause of action for fraud
based on concealment are: ‘(1) the defendant must have concealed or suppressed
a material fact, (2) the defendant must have been under a duty to disclose the
fact to the plaintiff, (3) the defendant must have intentionally concealed or
suppressed the fact with the intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff
must have been unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he did if he had
known of the concealed or suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of the
concealment or suppression of the fact, the plaintiff must have sustained
damage. [Citation.]’” (Kaldenbach v. Mutual of Omaha Life Ins. Co.
(2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 830, 850 (internal quotation marks omitted.) 
 
“There are ‘four
circumstances in which nondisclosure or concealment may constitute actionable
fraud: (1) when the defendant is in a fiduciary relationship with the
plaintiff; (2) when the defendant had exclusive knowledge of material facts not
known to the plaintiff; (3) when the defendant actively conceals a material
fact from the plaintiff; and (4) when the defendant makes partial
representations but also suppresses some material facts. [Citation.]’” (LiMandri v. Judkins (1997) 52
Cal.App.4th 326, 336.) “Each of the other three circumstances in which
nondisclosure may be actionable presupposes the existence of some other
relationship between the plaintiff and defendant in which a duty to disclose
can arise. … As a matter of common sense, such a relationship can only come
into being as a result of some sort of transaction between the parties.” (Id. at pp. 336–337.) 
 
“The
requirement's purpose is to inform consumers about a product's hazards and
faults of which they are unaware, so that they can refrain from using the
product altogether or evade the danger by careful use.” (Jones v.
ConocoPhillips Co. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 1187, 1198.) Users include
persons responsible for processing materials not privy to information regarding
necessary safety protocols. The withholding of said information subjects a
defendant to potential fraudulent concealment liability. (Id. at pp.
1199-1200.)
 
The operative complaint presents allegations
regarding knowledge of the allegedly toxic substance, crystalline silica,
dangers to workers engaged in the cutting, grinding, fabrication, polishing,
etc. with the product, and failure to disclose potential toxicity upon working
with said products. Decedent was specifically exposed and harmed as a result of
the non-disclosed hazards and continued work with the supplied product. The
allegations meet the standard for fraudulent concealment. (Bockrath v. Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc.
(1999) 21 Cal.4th 71, 78-79.)
 
Under the consideration for product liability summary judgment,
the court finds insufficient address of this standard by Paragon for purposes
of shifting the burden. The court therefore denies the motion for summary
adjudication on both the failure to shift the burden, and triable issues of
material regarding failure to warn on allegedly known hazards caused by
fabrication of products containing silica. [Rosenman Decl. and Declaration of
Brian Barrow.]
 
On the fifth cause of action for breach of implied warranties,
Paragon again contends Sanchez was at fault for not providing safety equipment,
and the products otherwise conformed to safety standards. The argument lacks evidentiary
support. Citing to Plaintiffs’ complaint (See Separate Statement of Material
Fact numbers 24-29) will neither establish an absence of sufficient evidence or
affirmatively establish a conforming product. The single concluding sentence
regarding (the rejected) sophisticated user doctrine and “Bigler-Engler
doctrines discussed infra” (e.g. 19:17-20:20) raises the “direct dealings”
discussion, but in context of the fraudulent concealment claim. In other words,
Paragon owed no duty to disclose. For the same reasons cited in the fraudulent
concealment section, the court rejects this argument as well. The court
otherwise declines to consider the new argument on “privity” and “fitness”
raised in the reply in that it deprives Plaintiffs of an opportunity to
respond. (U.S. Roofing, Inc. v. Credit Alliance Corp. (1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 1431, 1441; Balboa
Ins. Co. v. Aguirre (1983)
149 Cal.App.3d 1002, 1010.) Regardless, for the reasons stated in the
fraudulent cause of action the court finds a basis for a duty of disclosure to
Decedent for purposes of the instant motion and declines to find as a matter of
law a lack of said duty or other basis of a complete defense. (Bigler-Engler
v. Breg, Inc. (2017)
7 Cal.App.5th 276, 313-315.) The motion AND reply otherwise fail to establish
application of the privity requirement in the subject context fully taking into
account and accepting Sanchez as an employer. “[E]xceptions
to the privity requirement have been found in cases involving foodstuffs, drugs
and pesticides, substances marketed with the knowledge the purchaser may not be
the ultimate consumer of the product... The
strict requirement of privity has also been excused when an inherently
dangerous instrumentality causes harm to a buyer's employee. ... Whether these cases are viewed as expanding the doctrine of
privity or relieving a plaintiff of the obligation to demonstrate privity in
favor of the emerging tort doctrine of strict liability ... the result is the same.” (Jones
v. ConocoPhillips Co., supra, 198
Cal.App.4th at p. 1201.)
 
On the last item for summary adjudication, punitive damages, Paragon
offers a conclusive challenge regarding the lack of evidence to support the
claim for punitive damages. On punitive damages, Civil Code section 3294,
subdivision (c) authorizes punitive damages upon a showing of malice,
oppression, or fraud, which are defined
as follows:
 
(1) “Malice” means
conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or
despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and
conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.
(2) “Oppression”
means despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in
conscious disregard of that person’s rights.
(3) “Fraud” means an
intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact known
to the defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby
depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.
 
“‘[M]alice does not require actual
intent to harm. [Citation.] Conscious disregard for the safety of another may
be sufficient where the defendant is aware of the probable dangerous
consequences of his or her conduct and he or she willfully fails to avoid such
consequences. [Citation.] Malice may be proved either expressly through direct
evidence or by implication through indirect evidence from which the jury draws
inferences.’ [Citations.]”  (Pfeifer
v. John Crane, Inc. (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 1270, 1299.) 
 
Consistent with the prior part of the order, the
court again finds the motion insufficiently addresses the evidence presented by
Plaintiff regarding the knowing distribution of the silica containing product,
including corporate knowledge and direction for the manufacture and
distribution of an allegedly harmful product. [Index of Exhibits,
Responses to Specially Drafted Interrogatories and Requests for Production of
Documents.] (White
v. Ultramar, Inc. (1999) 21 Cal.4th 563, 576–577; Cruz v. HomeBase (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th
160, 168.) Such conduct establishes the right to seek punitive damages under
the malice standard. The
motion for summary adjudication is therefore denied in its entirety. 
 
In summary, the court denies the motion for summary judgment
and summary adjudication.
 
Paragon to give notice to all parties.
