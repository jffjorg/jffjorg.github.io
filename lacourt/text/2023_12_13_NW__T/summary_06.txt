And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to strike and tax the costs incurred by Golf Projects Lindero (Golf). The motion was brought by the defendant, Lake Lindero Homeowners Association (LLHOA), which disputed the propriety of the costs.

The court denied the motion to strike and tax the costs, finding that Golf had met its burden to show that the costs were necessary and reasonable. The court also found that LLHOA failed to present any admissible evidence to support its contention that the costs were excessive, unreasonable, or unnecessary.

The court addressed several specific items of cost, including deposition costs, service of process costs, expert fees, court-ordered mediation fees, and photocopying of exhibits. In each case, the court found that Golf had sufficiently explained the necessity and reasonableness of the costs and that LLHOA had failed to present any admissible evidence to support its contention that the costs were excessive, unreasonable, or unnecessary.

The court also noted several technical defects in the case, including the failure to file a request for entry of default and the lack of a substitution of attorney form for one of the defendants. The court ordered the clerk to give notice of its tentative ruling.
