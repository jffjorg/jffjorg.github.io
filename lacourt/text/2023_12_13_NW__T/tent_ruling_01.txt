  Case Number:  21STCV03893    Hearing Date:   December 13, 2023    Dept:  T 21STCV03893 DANIEL B. COOPER, et al. vs BONNIE &  CLYDE Tentative ruling: Motion to continue trial/MSJ-Deny.  No good cause shown. The complaint was filed  2/1/2021.  A First Amended Complaint was  filed 4/13/2021.  Defendants answered the  first amended complaint in June 2021.  New  counsel substituted into this case on 9/20/2023 but waited 2 months to send out  additional discovery.  Trial had already  been set for trial for 3/4/2024 one year earlier on 3/27/2023.  In that one year there was never any concern  about completion of discovery.  Indeed,  the trial setting conference was continued several times. Additionally, this  is the 5th law firm representing plaintiffs in this case.  Plaintiff cannot keep substituting in and out  counsel and then try to continue the matter due to lack of diligence in  conducting discovery.  By the time of  trial, the case will be 3 years old.Ruling on objections:1.
