And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel arbitration and stay the action brought by Hyundai Motor America and Keyes Hyundai of Van Nuys. The defendants argue that the arbitration agreement in the Motor Vehicle Lease Agreement (Lease) and the 2022 Owner's Handbook and Warranty Information (Handbook) is enforceable and that the dispute is within the scope of the arbitration agreement.

The Court finds that the Lease agreement is enforceable and that the dispute is within the scope of the arbitration agreement. However, the Court denies the defendants' request for arbitration and orders them to defend this civil action. The Court also notes that the plaintiff has not disputed the defendants' contention that the vehicle was actually leased, and therefore the Court reviewed the matter under the Lease agreement.

The defendants argued that they could enforce the arbitration agreement in the Lease, but the Court finds that they are not contracting parties or signatories to the Lease. The Court also disagrees with the defendants' argument that they can enforce the arbitration agreement in the Handbook, as there is no evidence that the plaintiff received or knew about the Handbook prior to leasing the vehicle.

The Court exercises its discretion to deny the defendants' request for arbitration and orders them to defend this civil action. The Court also notes that the plaintiff has not presented any admissible evidence to support his contention of indigency.
