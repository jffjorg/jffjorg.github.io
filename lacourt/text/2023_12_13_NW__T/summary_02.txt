And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has made several decisions regarding the motions filed by the parties. First, the plaintiff's motion for a protective order is granted in part. The deposition of the plaintiff will take place without additional production of documents in advance, but defense counsel may ask on the record if the plaintiff has any additional documents responsive to each request for production of documents in the deposition notice. If the plaintiff does have additional documents, they must produce them and then present themselves for a second session of deposition. The court also denied the plaintiff's motion to quash, as it was unnecessary given the grant of the protective order. The defendant's motion to compel deposition was granted, and the plaintiff must produce herself for a Zoom conference deposition by December 28, 2023. The parties are to work together to agree on a date and time, and if they cannot agree, the deposition will take place on December 28, 2023 at 9 a.m. by Zoom. Finally, the court noted that the plaintiff should have responded to defense counsel regarding the postponement of the deposition, but no sanctions will be imposed given the grant of the protective order.
