ALLEGATIONS:
 
Karen
Serrano (“Plaintiff”) filed suit against Daniel Jose Mari Marquez
(“Defendant”) and Does 1-100,
alleging motor vehicle and general
negligence arising out of a vehicular collision occurring on April 3, 2021.
 
HISTORY:
 
On January 25,
2024, Defendant filed the instant two motions: 1) to compel responses to form
interrogatories, set one and 2) to compel responses to request for production
of documents, set one.
No
opposition has been filed to date.
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED:
 
Defendant seeks an order compelling the
production of responses to form interrogatories, set one, and request for
production, set one. 
 
Defendant also seeks attorney fees in
connection with filing the instant motions.
 
ANALYSIS:
 
I.          LEGAL STANDARD
 
Failure to file an opposition to the motion indicates the other parties'
acquiescence that the motion is meritorious. CRC Rule 8.54(c)
 
The
Court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse
of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay
the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. (C.C.P. § 2023.030(a).)  
 
II.        MERITS
 
Defendant
propounded Request for Production of Documents, Set One, and Form
Interrogatories, Set One, on August 9, 2023. (Kandarian-Stein Decl., ¶ 4.) A copy of each
request is attached to their respective motions as Exhibit 1. Defendant granted
Plaintiff’s counsel an extension of time to respond by October 6, 2023.
(Kandarian-Stein Decl., ¶ 6.) However, to date, Plaintiff has failed to provide any response. (Kandarian-Stein Decl., ¶ 8.)
 
Plaintiff
was properly served with the discovery requests and motions to compel and have
filed no oppositions to either motion here. Accordingly, Defendant’s motions to
compel are granted. 
 
Defendant’s
counsel, Gina Kandarian-Stein, requests a total of $980.00 in connection
with bringing the instant motions ($290.00 (Compel RPDs) + $690.00 (Compel Form
Interrogatories)). The Court finds the counsel’s rate and hours reasonable.
Accordingly, Defendant’s request for reasonable attorney fees is granted in the
amount of $980.00 joint and several against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel. 
 
III.       CONCLUSION
 
Defendant’s
motions to compel responses to form interrogatories, set one, and request for
production of documents, set one, are GRANTED. Additionally, Defendant’s
request for reasonable attorney fees is GRANTED in the amount $980.00 joint and
several against Plaintiff’s counsel and Plaintiff.
