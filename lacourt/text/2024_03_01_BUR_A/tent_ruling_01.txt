MOTION TO
QUASH DEPOSITION SUBPOENA

Los Angeles Superior Court
Case # 22BBCV00346

 



MP:  


Anthony Bouyer (Plaintiff)




RP:  


Verdugo, Inc. (Defendant)



 
ALLEGATIONS: 
 
Anthony Bouyer ("Plaintiff")
filed suit against Verdugo, Inc., a California Corporation
("Defendant"), alleging that he is substantially limited in
performing one or more major life activities. Plaintiff visited Defendant’s
business establishment to purchase items and to verify whether Defendant is
complying with the California Unruh Civil Rights Act (“UCRA”) and the Americans
with Disabilities Act (“ADA”). Plaintiff alleges that Defendant’s business
violated ADA guidelines. On May 17, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Complaint, alleging
a single cause of action for Violation of the UCRA, California Civil Code, § 51
et seq.
 
 
HISTORY: 
 
Plaintiff then filed and served the subject
Motion to Quash with this Court with an original hearing date of March 22,
2024, now set for hearing by this Court on March 1, 2024.  On February 5, 2024, at the hearing on
Defendant's Motion to Compel Plaintiffs deposition, this Court advanced the
hearing on the subject Motion to Quash and set it for March 5 1, 2024. Both
parties were present at this hearing.
 
REQUEST FOR CURRENT RELIEF
 
Plaintiff asserts that Defendant improperly
served deposition subpoenas on Plaintiff’s physical therapists seeking business
records at a deposition.  The first
subpoena on Taylor Isaacs was served on January 24, 2024.  Plaintiff argues that Defendant failed to
comply with clear statutory requirements that a Notice to Consumer be timely
served to afford Plaintiff notice and an opportunity to object and oppose and
other rules pertaining to subpoenas.   Defendant sought:
 
• Defendant seeks Plaintiffs medical records in
addition to the witness's testimony but no Notice to Consumer document was ever
served (CCP l 985.3(a)(I )); 
 
• There was no Notice of Deposition served on
counsel with the Subpoena as required by the code; 
 
• the Subpoena was not completely filled out
and contained internally inconsistent information; 
 
• there is no evidence the Subpoena was ever
served on the witness which is required; 
 
• there is no information about how to attend
the deposition even if Plaintiff wanted to attend. 
• The Subpoena was untimely because it was
served on January 24, 2024 for the requested deposition date of January 31,
2024. 
 
Defendant
then served on the physical therapist Jon Gorospe of Core Centers another
subpoena, this one not requesting documents.  This second subpoena was served February 1, 2024.
 
  
ANALYSIS: 
 
I.               
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
Failure to file an opposition to the motion indicates the other parties'
acquiescence that the motion is meritorious. CRC Rule 8.54(c).   
 
CCP § 1987.2 permits a court in its discretion to award reasonable
expenses in making opposing motion a motion if the court finds that the motion
was made or opposed in bad faith or without substantial justification or that
one or more of the requirements of the subpoena was oppressive.
 
 
II.             
MERITS 
 
The Motion to
Quash being unopposed, pursuant to CRC Rule 8.54(c) the Court finds that the
Plaintiff’s motion does not appear to lack merit. Generally, a court construes
a party's failure to oppose a motion as a concession on the merits. D.I.
Chadbourne, Inc. v. Superior Court (1964) 60 Cal.2d 723, 728, fn. 4 (where
nonmoving party fails to oppose a ground for a motion "it is assumed that
[nonmoving party] concedes" that ground).)
 
The original motion
pertained only to the subpoena on Taylor Issacs.  The second subpoena was not part of the noticed
motion to which Defendant did not file an opposition.   As such, CRC Rule 8.54(c) would not be
applicable to that motion, nor was Defendant noticed that the subpoena was
being challenged.  While the Plaintiff
argues some important points in seeking in its notice of no opposition, nonetheless
the Court believes that addressing that subpoena without a properly noticed
motion is not an appropriate action by the Court.  However, the Court, is willing to setting the
matter for an Informal Discovery Conference to address the issue in an effort
to facilitate discovery and mitigate litigation costs.
 
The Court does
not find that Defense has made a sufficient showing that the subpoena was
oppressive to justify sanctions.  
Furthermore, given that Defense did not oppose the Motion to Quash the
Court does not find they acted in bad faith nor without substantial
justification.   As such, the Court declines
to grant sanctions.
