Mariduena, and Does 1 to 50, inclusive, asserting the  following causes of action: (1) breach of lease; (2) violation of Los Angeles  Municipal §  49.99.2; (3) tortious breach of warranty of habitability; (4) breach of the  covenant of quiet enjoyment; (5) negligence; (6) violation of the Los Angeles  Rent Stabilization Ordinance; (7) nuisance; (8) violation of the California  Business and Professions Code § 17200 et seq.; (9) violation of Los Angeles  Municipal Code § 45.33; (10) retaliatory eviction; and (11) harassment & unlawful  intimidation – California Civil Code § 1940.2.    The Complaint alleges the following, among other things. Plaintiff and Defendant Antonella R. Mariduena have been in a  landlord-tenant relationship since 2017. The latter breached the parties’ lease  by, among other things, failing to properly maintain the Property, failing to  provide habitable premises, and allowing unsafe conditions to exist at the  Property. In addition, the defendants retaliated against Plaintiff by filing  two frivolous unlawful detainer lawsuits in retaliation for him exercising his  rights as a tenant.     HISTORY:    On May 12, 2023, Plaintiff amended his Complaint to substitute Defendants  Janina Mariduena and Luis Rodriguez (collectively, “Defendants”) for the  defendants sued fictitiously as Does 1 and 2, respectively.    On  October 5, 2023, Defendants filed the instant motion, seeking an order striking  portions of the Complaint as a Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation (“SLAPP”).  Defendants argue those portions arise from their right to petition.    On January  16, 2024, Plaintiff filed his opposition.    On  January 22, 2024, Defendants filed their objection to the opposition, arguing  the opposition was untimely. The hearing for the motion was initially set for  January 26, 2024, but on January 24, 2024, the Court continued the hearing to  its current date, March 1, 2024.   On  January 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed a supplemental request for judicial notice in  support of his opposition to the motion.     The Court is still  engaged in trial and has been unable to complete its tentative ruling on this  matter.   The matter will be continued  for a short period of time to Wednesday, March 6, 2023 at 10:00 a.m. or such  other date that counsel may stipulate.   ---    RULING:   In the  event the parties submit on this tentative ruling, or a party requests a signed  order or the court in its discretion elects to sign a formal order, the  following form will be either electronically signed or signed in hard copy and  entered into the court’s records.    ORDER  Defendants Janina  Mariduena and Luis Rodriguez’s Special Motion to Strik came on regularly for hearing on March 1, 2024, with appearances/submissions as  noted in the minute order for said hearing, and the court, being fully advised  in the premises, and now rules as  follows:    THE  SPECIAL MOTION TO STRIKE IS CONTINUED TO MARCH 6, 2024 AT 10:00 A.M.   DEFENDANTS  TO GIVE NOTICE.   IT IS SO  ORDERED.    DATE:  March 1, 2024                            _______________________________                                                                           F.M.
