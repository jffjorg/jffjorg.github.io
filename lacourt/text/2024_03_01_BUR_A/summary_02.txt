And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge, F.M. Tavelman, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Jim Cohan (Plaintiff) vs. Sami Ammari (Defendant) regarding a motion to compel response to requests for production of documents (Set One). The motion was filed on January 22, 2024, and no opposition was filed by the defendant. The Judge finds that the plaintiff's motion is meritorious and grants the motion, ordering the defendant to respond to the requests. The Judge also awards monetary sanctions to the plaintiff in the amount of $660.00, based on the defendant's failure to file an opposition to the motion. The Judge notes that the defendant's failure to respond to the requests and failure to file an opposition to the motion indicates that the motion is meritorious and that the defendant has waived his right to oppose the motion. The Judge also notes that the plaintiff's contradictory evidence concerning proper service of discovery demands does not affect the outcome of the motion.
