ALLEGATIONS:
 
Jim Cohan ("Plaintiff") filed a
Complaint on November 8, 2022, against Sami Ammari ("Defendant")  alleging three causes of action: (1) quiet
title; (2) constructive trust; (3) and resulting trust.   
 
PRESENTATION:
 
Plaintiff moves for orders to compel responses to
Request for Production of Documents (Set One). Plaintiff requests an award of
monetary sanctions against Defendant and/or his attorneys of record in the
amount of $2,465.00.   
 
This motion was filed on January 22, 2024. An
opposition to this motion was not filed; however, Defendant only filed an
opposition to the motion concerning interrogatories and special interrogatories
on February 5, 2024. 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
I.          LEGAL
STANDARD
 
A party must respond to a requests for production of
documents within 30 days after service. (C.C.P. §§ 2030.260(a), 2031.260(a).) If
a party to whom a request for production of documents are directed does not
provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order compelling
responses to the discovery. (C.C.P. §§ 2030.290(b), 2031.300(b).) The party
also waives the right to make any objections, including one based on privilege
or work-product protection. (C.C.P. §§ 2030.290(a); 2031.300(a).)  
 
The Court may
impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the
discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct. (C.C.P.
§ 2023.030(a).) The Court shall impose monetary
sanctions against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (C.C.P. § 2030.290(c).)
 
 
II.        MERITS
 
Plaintiff submitted evidence it
propounded his Requests for the Production of Documents, on Defendant on September
7, 2023, via email to Peter M. Cho, Esq. (Miller Decl. at ¶ 2, Exh. 1.) Plaintiff
submitted evidence that he received no responses to the request, even with a 30
day extension, leaving the responses due on October 7, 2023. (Id. at ¶ 4,
Exh. 2.) 
 
As of the date of this hearing, Defendant has
not rendered a response to this motion. Defendant did not file any opposition to
this motion within nine days of the hearing as per C.C.P. § 1005(b). 
 
The Court does note, that similar to the
Plaintiff’s prior motions to compel discovery, Plaintiff presented
contradictory evidence concerning proper service of his discovery demands.
Plaintiff submits the declaration of his counsel, Richard T. Miller (Miller),
which attests that discovery was served on Defendant directly by email on
September 7, 2023. However, the proofs of service attached to the Miller
declaration state that the discovery was served by U.S. mail on that same date.  While it may not be clear from Plaintiff’s
submissions how these documents were served, unlike the other motions to compel
Defendant filed an opposition.   In that
prior opposition, Defendant attested he never received the discovery
demands.   That is not the case
here.   No opposition to refute receipt
of this discovery was received.  Failure to file an opposition to the motion
indicates the other parties' acquiescence that the motion is meritorious. CRC
Rule 8.54(c).
 
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s unopposed
motion to compel Defendant’s initial response to Request for Documents (Set
One) is granted. 
 
 
III.       SANCTIONS
 
As concerns motions to compel, the law only requires
sanctions in the event that a party unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel a response. (C.C.P. §§ 2031.300 and 2031.290.) As such, any monetary
sanctions granted are within the discretionary power of the Court as per C.C.P.
§ 2030.290. It is customary to grant sanctions where a party has filed a motion
to compel and the other party fails to file an opposition. (California Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1348(a).) Here, Plaintiff prepared and filed the instant motion while
Defendant has rendered no opposition. Therefore, the Court awards sanctions to
Plaintiff in the reduced amount of  $660
based on 2 hours of attorney work per motion at $300 per hour, plus a $60
filing fee (300 x 2.0 = 600 + 60 = 660). The additional 3.0 hours estimated by
Defendant’s attorney in preparing a reply is not present in the above
calculation given that no opposition was filed. 
 
RULING:
 
In the event the parties submit on this
tentative ruling, or a party requests a signed order or the Court in its
discretion elects to sign a formal order, the following form will be either
electronically signed or signed in hard copy and entered into the Court’s
records.
