Significant Statements:
  - "To establish personal jurisdiction, compliance with statutory procedures for service of process is essential; if a default judgment was entered against a defendant who was not served with a summons as required by statute, the judgment is void, as the court lacked jurisdiction in a fundamental sense over the party and lacked authority to enter judgment."
  - "To set aside a judgment based upon extrinsic mistake one must satisfy three elements. First, the defaulted party must demonstrate that it has a meritorious case. Second, the party seeking to set aside the default must articulate a satisfactory excuse for not presenting a defense to the original action. Last, the moving party must demonstrate diligence in seeking to set aside the default once ... discovered."
  - "The Court does not find that Defendant has provided adequate proof that he was not served with notice of the action. Therefore, the Court finds no defects in the proof of service that cause the judgment to be void."
  - "The Court declines to find the service on Defendant defective. Defendant does not provide any evidence or support as to the other grounds sought. Thus, Defendant Valentine's motion is DENIED."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to set aside and vacate a default judgment in an unlawful detainer action. The defendant, Christopher Valentine, alleges that he was not served with notice of the lawsuit and that the default judgment is void. The judge finds that the defendant has not provided adequate proof that he was not served with notice of the action and therefore declines to find the service defective. The judge also finds that the defendant has not provided any evidence or support as to the other grounds sought to set aside the default judgment. As a result, the judge denies the motion.
