ALLEGATIONS: 
 
On March 30, 2023, Lilia Alcantar (“Plaintiff”) filed a
Complaint against Sharky’s Coldwater Ventura Enterprises, Inc. and Does
1 through 20 (collectively, “Defendants”). Plaintiff
brings this employment action against Defendants asserting ten causes of action
under the Private Attorney General Act (“PAGA”) such as for failure to pay
wages, failure to pay overtime wages, failure to provide meal periods, and
failure to provide rest periods. 
 
The current Motion for Order of Approval of PAGA Settlement
was filed on February 14, 2024. No opposition was filed.   
 
REQUESTED RELIEF:  
 
Plaintiff requests an Order and Judgment approving the
parties’ PAGA Settlement.  
  
ANALYSIS: 
 
I.                   
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
Under
Labor Code section 2699(l)(2): “The superior court shall review and approve any
settlement of any civil action filed pursuant to this part. The proposed
settlement shall be submitted to the agency at the same time that it is
submitted to the court.”¿ (Lab. Code. §2699(l)(2); see¿Williams v. Superior
Court¿(2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 549 [noting in passing that “PAGA settlements
are subject to trial court review and approval, ensuring that any negotiated
resolution is fair to those affected.”].)¿ 
¿ 
“[N]either
the California legislature, nor the California Supreme Court, nor the
California Courts of Appeal, nor the [LWDA] has provided any definitive answer
as to what the appropriate standard is for approval of a PAGA settlement.”¿(Haralson
v. U.S. Aviation Services Corp.¿(N.D. Cal. 2019) 383 F.Supp.3d 959,
971].)¿“In commenting on a proposed PAGA settlement, the LWDA has offered only
this guidance:¿¿It is thus important that when a PAGA claim is settled, the
relief provided for under the PAGA be genuine and meaningful, consistent with
the underlying purpose of the statute to benefit the public and, in the context
of a class action, the court evaluate whether the settlement meets the
standards of being ‘fundamentally fair, reasonable, and adequate’ with
reference to the public policies underlying the PAGA.”¿ (Id.;¿see also¿Flores
v. Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc.¿(C.D. Cal. 2017) 253
F.Supp.3d 1074, 1077 [federal district court approved PAGA settlement where
court was satisfied that the parties' settlement was “fair and adequate in view
of the purposes and policies of the statute” and the parties “adequately
divvied up the civil penalties under Section 2699(i) of the California Labor
Code.”];¿Nordstrom Com. Cases¿(2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 576, 589¿[a¿court
may exercise its discretion to approve a settlement of a suit that includes a
PAGA claim even if no portion of the settlement is allocated toward payment to
the LWDA].)¿¿ 
 
II.                
MERITS 
 
Plaintiff moves the court
to approve the proposed settlement claims pursuant to the Private Attorneys
General Act. The potential aggrieved employees total 69. (Adams Decl. ¶ 17.)  
 
Terms of the Settlement
 
·        
Settlement
Fund: Defendant shall pay $40,000.00 including the payments to the aggrieved
employees, attorneys’ fees, administration costs, and payment to the
LWDA.  (Adams Decl. ¶¶ 22-25.)
 
·        
PAGA Payment:
$16,943.49 will be allocated to the LWDA and the PAGA fund, with 75% ($12,707.62)
going to the LWDA and 25% ($4,235.87) going to the aggrieved employees via
their individual settlement payments. (Adams Decl. ¶ 25; Stipulation ¶ III(3).) 
 
·        
Counsel
Award: Plaintiff’s counsel shall be awarded fees in an amount not to exceed $13,333.00
and costs not to exceed $5,728.51. (Stipulation ¶ III(4).)  
 
·        
Settlement
Administration Costs: ILYM Group, Inc. shall be paid $3,995.00 to act as the Settlement
Administrator. (Stipulation ¶ III(5).) 
 
The foregoing deductions ($23,056.51) result in
a net settlement of amount of approximately $16,943.49 with an average payment
of $4,235.87 per class member. The Defendant Sharky’s Coldwater Ventura
Enterprises, Inc. will provide the Settlement Administrator no later than
twenty-one (21) business days after the Effective Date, the Settlement
Administrator with a list of the Aggrieved Employees (the “Aggrieved Employees
List”). The Aggrieved Employees List shall include each Aggrieved Employee’s
full name, last known mailing address, start and end date(s) of employment or
total pay periods worked for Defendant in California during the PAGA Period,
and Social Security number, to the extent available from Defendant’s records.
(Stipulation ¶ IV(2).)
Requirement to Send Agency
a Copy of Proposed Settlement 
 
“The proposed settlement
shall be submitted to the agency at the same time that it is submitted to the
court.” (Lab. Code § 2699, subd. (l)(2).) Counsel for Plaintiff declares that
the Proposed Settlement was submitted to the LWDA concurrently with this motion.
(Adams Decl. ¶ 32.) 
 
Settlement Before Class
Certification 
 
California Rules of Court,
Rule 3.769(d) enables the court to make an order approving or denying
certification of a provisional settlement class after the primary settlement
hearing. Here, the parties agree that class certification is appropriate for
purposes of settlement. (See generally, Stipulation.) The Court finds
the requirements of the class being ascertainable, having common questions, and
typical claims are present in accordance with the lower standard for settlement
class certification. (Dunk v. Ford Motor Co. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th
1794, 1807; Adams Decl. ¶¶ 36-41.) 
 
Fairness, Reasonableness,
and Adequacy of PAGA Settlement 
 
“PAGA settlements are
subject to trial court review and approval, ensuring that any negotiated
resolution is fair to those affected.” (Williams v. Superior Court
(2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 549, citing Lab. Code § 2699, subd. (l)(2).) The trial
court must determine that the settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate to
all concerned. (Reed v. United Teachers Los Angeles (2012) 208
Cal.App.4th 332, 337.) 
 
There is a presumption that
the settlement agreement is fair where: (1) the settlement is reached through
arm’s-length bargaining; (2) investigation and discovery are sufficient to
allow counsel and the trial court to act intelligently; (3) counsel is experienced
in similar litigation; and (4) the percentage of objectors is small. (Reed
supra, 208 Cal.App.4th at 337.) This standard applies in the context of
class actions and qui tam actions alike. (See Gov. Code § 12652, subd. (e)(2)
[in qui tam action, a state or political subdivision may settle the action with
the defendant despite objections of the qui tam plaintiff if the court
determines, after a hearing providing the qui tam plaintiff an opportunity to
present evidence, that the proposed settlement is fair, adequate, and
reasonable under all the circumstances]; see also Iskanian v. CLS
Transportation Los Angeles LLC (2014) 59 Cal.4th 348, 382 [a PAGA
representative action is a type of qui tam action].) 
 
On August 17, 2023, the
parties participated in a mediation with mediator Kevin T. Barnes. (Adams Decl.
¶ 19.) The parties did not reach an agreement at the mediation but did reach an
agreement with the mediator’s help several months later. (Adams Dec. ¶
19-20.)  Further, Plaintiff’s counsel conducted an investigation and
engaged in informal discovery since the outset of the action. (Adams Decl. ¶¶ 19.)  Plaintiff’s
counsel states he has been certified as class counsel for several class action
matters. (Adams Decl. ¶ 9.) Plaintiff is unaware of any opposition by the
LWDA or any Aggrieved Employee. (Adams Decl. ¶ 31.) Additionally, the LWDA has
not commented constituting its tacit approval. (Id. at ¶ 32.) Accordingly,
the Court finds the settlement is entitled to a presumption of fairness. 
 
Even once the presumption
of fairness has been established, the court bears the responsibility to ensure
the recovery under the settlement agreement represents a reasonable compromise,
given the magnitude and apparent merit of the claims being released, discounted
by the risks and expenses of attempting to establish and collect on those
claims by pursuing the litigation. (Kullar v. Foot Locker Retail, Inc.
(2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 116, 129.)  
 
Plaintiff states the
estimate liability related to their claims, including PAGA civil penalties, is
approximately $ 61,200.000. (Adams Decl ¶¶ 40.) Plaintiff argues the settlement
is reasonable in light of the hurdle of class certifications and the risk of
losing her case on the merits. (Adams Decl. ¶¶ 37-45.) Additionally, Defendant
has agreed to separately settle Plaintiff’s individual claims alleged in this
action. (Id. at ¶ 46.)  The Court finds the benefits of the
settlement are reasonable as the Settlement Fund provides $4,235.87 to the
aggrieved employees, to be distributed according to how many hours each
employee worked during the period of violations. (Adams Decl. ¶ 25.)  Additionally,
the scope of the release is narrowly tailored. The release is limited to PAGA claims
brought in this action. (Stipulation ¶¶ III (6-7).) Individual underlying
claims or causes of action that Aggrieved Employees may have under the law
against Released Parties for violations of the California Labor Code are not
released. (Id. at ¶ III(7).)
  
The above factors indicate
that the settlement agreement is fair and reasonable.  
 
Attorney’s Fees and
Litigation Costs 
 
The award of attorney fees
is made by the court at the fairness hearing using the lodestar method with a
multiplier, if appropriate.¿ (Ketchum III v. Moses (2000) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1132-36.)¿ Despite any agreement by the parties to the contrary, the
court has an independent responsibility to review the attorney fee provision of
the settlement agreement and award an amount that it determines to be
reasonable.¿ (Garabedian v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. (2004)
118 Cal.App.4th 123, 128.)¿ 
 
Here, Plaintiff seeks no
more than $13,333.00 in fees and $5,728.51 in costs from the $40,000.00 Settlement
Fund. The question of whether class counsel is entitled to this amount will be
addressed at the fairness hearing when class counsel brings a noticed motion
for attorneys’ fees. With the motion, counsel must provide an overall summary
of the time spent by each attorney or paralegal who worked on this matter. (Laffitte
v. Robert Half Intern., Inc. (2016) 1 Cal.5th 480, 505.)  
  
Proposed Class Notice 
 
The notice to Class Members
must fairly apprise the prospective members of the terms of the settlement. (7-Eleven
Owners for Fair Franchising v. Southland Corp. (2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 1135,
1164; see also CRC Rule 3.769.) A review of the proposed Class Notice, attached
as Exhibit B to the Adams Decl., reveals it adequately apprises potential class
members of the terms of the settlement and their legal rights in accordance
with the settlement. 
 
III.             
CONCLUSION
 
The
motion for preliminary approval of the class action settlement is GRANTED.
