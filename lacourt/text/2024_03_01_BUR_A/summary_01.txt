And here is the summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Anthony Bouyer vs. Verdugo, Inc. The case involves a motion to quash two deposition subpoenas served on Taylor Isaacs and Jon Gorospe, physical therapists who treated Bouyer. Bouyer alleges that Verdugo, Inc. violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the California Unruh Civil Rights Act. Bouyer asserts that the deposition subpoenas were served without proper notice and that Verdugo, Inc. failed to comply with statutory requirements.

The Judge granted the motion to quash the deposition subpoena served on Taylor Isaacs, but denied the motion to quash the deposition subpoena served on Jon Gorospe without prejudice as insufficiently noticed. The Judge also denied Verdugo, Inc.'s request for sanctions. The Judge is willing to set the matter for an informal discovery conference to address the issue and facilitate discovery and mitigate litigation costs.
