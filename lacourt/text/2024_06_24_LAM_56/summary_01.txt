And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel responses to special interrogatories, form interrogatories, and requests for production of documents. The plaintiff served the interrogatories and requests on the defendant on November 14, 2023, but the defendant failed to respond. The court found that the plaintiff had shown that the interrogatories were served, the time had expired to respond, and no responses had been served, and therefore granted the motion. The defendant is ordered to submit complete, code-compliant, and verified responses to the interrogatories and requests for production of documents within 20 days of the order. No sanctions were imposed since no request was made in the motion.
