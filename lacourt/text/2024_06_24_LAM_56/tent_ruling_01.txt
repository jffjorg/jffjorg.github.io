BACKGROUND
            This case arises from a complaint filed by Plaintiff Roie Maor
(“Plaintiff”) against Defendant Eve M. Aron (“Defendant”) on December 9, 2022.  The complaint asserts breach of contract and
various other causes of action stemming from an agreement in which Plaintiff
purportedly agreed to lend money to Defendant, who in turn, allegedly agreed to
use the funds to buy and resell horses for profit.


 
 
MOTION
TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE
The Court
considered the moving papers filed.  The
motion is unopposed. 
 
The Court initially
notes that the purported “Reply re Defendant’s Non-Opposition to the Motion to
Compel Further” was not necessary and is not being considered by the Court.
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section
2030.290, subdivision (b), when a party directs interrogatories towards a party,
and that party fails to serve a timely response, the party propounding the
interrogatories may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories.  (CCP § 2030.290, subd.
(b).)  A party who fails to provide a
timely response waives any objection, including one based on privilege or work
product.  (Id., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)  The moving party need only show that the
interrogatories were served on the opposing party, the time has expired to
respond to the interrogatories and no responses have been served in order for the
court to compel the opposing party to respond.  (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d
902, 906.)  “The court shall impose a
monetary sanction… against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully
makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Id.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (c).)
 
Here, Plaintiff
served Special Interrogatories (“SIs”) upon Defendant on November 14, 2023.  (Declaration of Richard B. Rudolph in Support
of Motion to Compel Responses to SIs (“Rudolph SIs Decl.”), ¶ 3.)  Defendant did not serve responses to the SIs
as of the date of filing of this motion on March 26, 2024.  (Rudolph SIs Decl., ¶ 6.)  Plaintiff now moves for an order compelling
Defendant to serve responses to the SIs.
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses to the SIs is GRANTED.  Defendant is
ordered to submit complete, Code-compliant and verified responses to the SIs, without
objections, within 20 days of this
order.  Since no request for sanctions
was made in the motion, no sanctions are imposed.
 
MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO FORM
INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE
 
The Court
considered the moving papers filed.  The
motion is unopposed. 
 
As noted
above, when a party directs interrogatories towards a party,
and that party fails to serve a timely response, the party propounding the
interrogatories may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories.  (CCP § 2030.290, subd.
(b).)  A party who fails to provide a
timely response waives any objection, including one based on privilege or work
product.  (Id., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)  The moving party need only show that the
interrogatories were served on the opposing party, the time has expired to
respond to the interrogatories and no responses have been served in order for the
court to compel the opposing party to respond.  (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d
902, 906.)  “The court shall impose a
monetary sanction… against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully
makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Id.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (c).)
 
Here, Plaintiff
served Form Interrogatories (“FIs”) upon Defendant on November 14, 2023.  (Declaration of Richard B. Rudolph in Support
of Motion to Compel Responses to FIs (“Rudolph FIs Decl.”), ¶ 3.)  Defendant did not serve responses to the FIs
as of the date of filing of this motion on March 25, 2024.  (Rudolph FIs Decl., ¶ 6.)  Plaintiff now moves for an order compelling
Defendant to serve responses to the FIs. 
The Court notes that although the motion was filed as a Motion to Compel
Further, it is in fact a Motion to Compel initial responses.
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses to the FIs is
GRANTED.  Defendant
is ordered to submit complete, Code-compliant and verified responses to the Fis,
without
objections, within 20 days of this
order.  Since no request for sanctions
was made in the motion, no sanctions are imposed.
 
MOTION
TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS, SET ONE
 
The Court
considered the moving papers filed.  The
motion is unopposed. 
 
When a
party fails to serve a timely response to an inspection demand, the party
making the demand may move for an order compelling a response to the inspection
demand.  (CCP § 2031.300, subd. (b).)  A party who fails to provide a timely response
waives any objection, including one based on privilege or work product. (Id.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (a).)  “[T]he court
shall impose a monetary sanction… against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject
to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Id., §
2031.300, subd. (c).)
 
Here, Plaintiff
served Requests for Production of Documents (“RFPs”) upon Defendant on November
14, 2023.  (Declaration of Richard B. Rudolph
in Support of Motion to Compel Responses to RFPs (“Rudolph RFPs Decl.”), ¶ 3.)  Defendant did not serve responses to the RFPs
as of the date of filing of this motion on March 25, 2024.  (Rudolph RFPs Decl., ¶ 8.)  Plaintiff now moves for an order compelling
Defendant to serve responses to the RFPs. 

 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses to the RFPs is
GRANTED.  Defendant
is ordered to submit complete, Code-compliant and verified responses to the RFPs,
without
objections, together with all responsive documents within 20 days of this order. 
Since no request for sanctions was made in the motion, no sanctions are
imposed.
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
