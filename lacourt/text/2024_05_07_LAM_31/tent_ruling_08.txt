DEMURRER
WITHOUT MOTION TO STRIKE



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant
Cesar Enrique Villafuerte 
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiff Luz
Aida Escoto
 
 
I.          FACTUAL AND
PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff Luz Aida Escoto (“Plaintiff” or “Escoto”) was the
owner of the real property located at 1619 W. 70th Street, Los
Angeles, CA, 90047 (the “Subject Property”). 
In 2008, Escoto was experiencing financial issues and was close to
losing the Subject Property.  At the
time, Escoto was in a committed relationship with Defendant Cesar Enrique
Villafuerte (“Defendant” or “Villafuerte”). 
Villafuerte offered to help.  Escoto eventually agreed to transfer the
Subject Property to Villafuerte on a short sale basis through a quit claim
deed.  Villafuerte understood and agreed
that the Subject Property would be transferred to him in name only, and on a
temporary basis.  Villafuerte also agreed
to, and did, submit upon Escoto’s request, a new quitclaim deed to transfer the
Subject Property to Escoto’s mother.  In
exchange, Escoto agreed to pay off a $10,000 debt that Villafuerte owed to
third parties.  Based on the foregoing
agreement, Escoto transferred title to the Subject Property to Villafuerte on
July 14, 2009.  On July 23, 2009, the
deed granting the Subject Property from Villafuerte to Escoto’s mother was
recorded.  Villafuerte never made any payments
for the benefit of the Subject Property and never resided there.
 
In 2014, Escoto
ended the relationship with Villafuerte. 
In retaliation, Villafuerte filed suit against Escoto and others to
cancel the deed recorded on July 23, 2009, claiming that he did not have
knowledge of the parties’ agreement.  Defendant
obtained a Court Judgment in Los Angeles Superior Court Case No. BC486408
which, in relevant part, canceled the deed recorded on July 23, 2009.
 
On November 11, 2023, Escoto filed a Verified Complaint against
Villafuerte in this court, alleging causes of action for  Quiet Title by Adverse Possession and Breach
of Oral Contract.
 
On February 28, 2024, Villafuerte filed this Demurrer to the
Breach of Oral Contract cause of action.
 
Escoto filed an opposition. 
Villafuerte has not filed a reply.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD FOR DEMURRER
            A demurrer
tests the legal sufficiency of the pleadings and will be sustained only where
the pleading is defective on its face.¿ (City of Atascadero v. Merrill
Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 445, 459.)¿
“We treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded but not
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.¿ We accept the factual
allegations of the complaint as true and also consider matters which may be
judicially noticed.¿ [Citation.]”¿ (Mitchell v. California Department of
Public Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007; Del E. Webb Corp. v.
Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604 [“the facts alleged
in the pleading are deemed to be true, however improbable they may be”].)
Allegations are to be liberally construed.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.)¿ In
construing the allegations, the court is to give effect to specific factual
allegations that may modify or limit inconsistent general or conclusory
allegations.¿ (Financial Corporation of America v. Wilburn (1987) 189
Cal.App.3d 764, 769.)¿¿  
            A
demurrer may be brought if insufficient facts are stated to support the cause
of action asserted.¿(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).)¿“A demurrer for
uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some respects
uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery
procedures.”¿(Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th
612, 616.)¿¿¿ 
            Where the
complaint contains substantial factual allegations sufficiently apprising
defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet, a demurrer for uncertainty
will be overruled or plaintiff will be given leave to amend.¿ (Williams v.
Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)¿ Leave to
amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment.¿ (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿ The burden
is on the complainant to show the court that a pleading can be amended
successfully. (Ibid.)¿
III.       DISCUSSION
 
            Meet and Confer
 
            “Before filing a demurrer pursuant
to this chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person, by
telephone, or by video conference with the party who filed the pleading that is
subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be
reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.”¿ (Code
Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).)¿ Here, Defendant has not made a showing of
meeting and conferring in person, by telephone, or by video conference prior to
filing this Demurrer. (See Declaration of Peter D. Gordon, ¶ 1, Ex. A.)  However, “[a] determination by the court that
the meet and confer process was insufficient shall not be grounds to overrule
or sustain a demurrer.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(4).) 
Accordingly, the court exercises its discretion to consider Defendant’s
demurrer.¿¿ 
 
            Analysis
 
Defendant demurs
to the the Second Cause of Action for Breach of Oral Agreement on the ground
that it is time-barred. 
 
The elements of a
breach of contract cause of action are: (1) the existence of a valid contract
between the plaintiff and the defendant, (2) the plaintiff’s performance, (3)
the defendant’s unjustified failure to perform, and (4) damages to the
plaintiff caused by the defendant’s breach. (CACI No. 303; Careau & Co.
v. Security Pacific Business, Inc. (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1371, 1388 (Careau);
Otworth v. Southern Pac. Transportation (1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 452, 458.)
“[T]he complaint must indicate on its face whether the contract is written,
oral, or implied by conduct.” (Otworth, 166 Cal.App.3d at pp. 458-459.)¿
The elements of a breach of oral contract claim are the same as those for a
breach of written contract. (Careau, 222 Cal.App.3d at p. 1388.)  A claim for breach of oral contract must be
brought within two years of the breach. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 339.)
 
Here, Defendant argues
the breach of the oral agreement occurred in 2014.  In support, he points to the allegation that
he “filed a lawsuit against Plaintiff and others on or about December 16, 2014
bearing Los Angeles Superior Court case no. BC486408” and that “[e]ventually,  Defendant obtained a Court Judgment which
canceled the deed recorded on July 23, 2009.” 
(Complaint, ¶ 19.)  “The December
16, 2014 Judgment was recorded with the Los Angeles County Recorder's office on
January 9, 2015 bearing recording number 20091121505.”  (Id.) 
Thus, under Defendant’s theory, Plaintiff had until January 9, 2017—two years
from the recording of the judgment on January 9, 2015—to bring her breach of
oral contract claim.  
 
Defendant’s points
are well taken. Filing suit in 2014 on the ground that Defendant “had no
knowledge of what he had signed and acted ignorantly to the situation” is
certainly inconsistent with “being fully onboard” with the parties oral
agreement.  (Complaint, ¶ 18.)  And, certainly, proceeding to judgment in
2015, is an act inconsistent with the parties’ agreement to make the numerous transfers
of title to the Subject Property.
 
In opposition,
Plaintiff makes the point that the Complaint does not state when the breach
occurred.  Effectively, Plaintiff
concedes that the claim is uncertain.  Plaintiff
further states that she can amend the complaint to allege that “she never
demanded return of the title [to the Subject Property] prior to the filing
other present Complaint, which was filed November 22, 2023.”  (Opposition, p. 2:19-21.)  Given this representation, the court will
sustain the demurrer and grant leave to amend. 
 
IV.        CONCLUSION
            
The Demurrer to the Second Cause of Action is SUSTAINED.  Leave to amend is GRANTED.  Plaintiff shall have twenty days from the
date of this Order to file a First Amended Complaint.   
 
The parties are further ordered to file a Notice of Related
Case in Case No. BC486408.  (See Cal.
Rules of Court, rule Rule 3.300.)
 
Defendant to give notice.
