And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to compel production of unredacted documents without prejudice. The plaintiff filed a motion to compel production of documents, but the defendants asserted claims of privilege and produced redacted documents. The court finds that the dispute centers on the defendants' claim of privilege and that the volume of the instant discovery dispute presents exceptional circumstances to appoint a discovery referee. The court will appoint a discovery referee to determine the defendants' claims of privilege. The parties are directed to each serve and file a list of three candidates with their resumes, and the court will set a hearing to consider the appointment of the referee.
