And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion filed by the plaintiffs, NBZ Investments, LLC, and Neda and Behzad Zaman, to relate their case (22STCV12440) with another case (24STCV02510) filed by Gabriel Basmajian v. Castle Mortgage Corporation. The court previously found that the cases were not related. The plaintiffs are now seeking to relate the cases under California Rules of Court, Rule 3.300(h)(1)(D). However, the court finds that the motion is not properly before it and must be filed with the presiding judge or the judge designated by the presiding judge. The court therefore places the motion off calendar and directs the plaintiffs to file the motion with the presiding judge.
