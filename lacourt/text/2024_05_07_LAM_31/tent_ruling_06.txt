MOTION
TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL



 
MOVING PARTY:               Karo
Karapetyan, Karapetyan Law Firm
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
 
            On March
12, 2024, Karo Karapetyan, counsel for Defendant, Orange County Flight Center,
filed this Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel.
 
            The Motion
is unopposed.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel) requires (1)
notice of motion and motion to be directed to the client (made on the Notice of
Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a
declaration stating in general terms and without compromising the
confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of
Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under
Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the Declaration in Support of
Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-052)); (3) service
of the notice of motion and motion and declaration on all other parties who
have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order relieving counsel
(prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as
Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)).¿ 
The court
has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be
granted provided that there is no prejudice to the client, and it does not
disrupt the orderly process of justice.  (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant
(1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)¿
            
III.      DISCUSSION
 
            Karo Karapetyan seeks to be relieved
as counsel of record for Defendant for the following reasons: “The client has
breached the attorney-client retainer agreement, in several ways, but including
regarding attorney fees and costs. Further evidence in support of this motion
will be provided in camera, if required by the court.”  (Form MC-052.)    
 
Absent a showing
of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398,
406.)¿¿ 
 
Upon review, the
court finds that the Motion complies with California Rules of Court, rule
3.1362. 
 
IV.        CONCLUSION
            
Accordingly, the unopposed Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel
is GRANTED and effective upon the filing of the proof of service of this signed
order on Defendant.  
 
The court notes that Defendant’s demurrer is scheduled for
hearing on May 30, 2024.  The court will
hear from the parties whether the demurrer must be continued or taken off
calendar given the court’s ruling and the requirement that entities, such as
Defendant, must be represented by counsel.
 
The court sets a Status Conference re: Counsel for Defendant
on May 30, 2024.  
 
Dated:   May 7, 2024
