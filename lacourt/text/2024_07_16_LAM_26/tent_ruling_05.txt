[1] Plaintiff
does not argue that she was never given a copy of the rules of the arbitral
body or was not informed as to which arbitral body will preside over the
arbitration. Plaintiff therefore has waived any arguments as to not receiving
any arbitration rules or not being advised of whom will be conducting the
arbitration as “[c]ontentions are waived when a party fails to support them
with reasoned argument and citations to authority.” (Moulton Niguel Water
Dist. v. Colombo (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1210, 1215.)
