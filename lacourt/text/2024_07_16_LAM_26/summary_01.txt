And here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses four motions filed by defendants and cross-defendants in a case involving a breach of contract and declaratory relief. The motions include requests to compel further responses to requests for production and a motion for relief from waiver of objections. The court denies the motions to compel further responses to requests for production filed by defendants E-Shop Labo LLC, Miwa Tamura, and Keisuke Shimada against plaintiffs Total Management Services America, Inc. and Global Data Innovators, Inc. The court also denies the motion to compel further responses to requests for production filed by defendants against plaintiff Total Management Services America, Inc. However, the court grants the motion for relief from waiver of objections filed by cross-defendant Takayuki Sasaki. The court finds that cross-defendant Sasaki's failure to serve timely responses was due to mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect and that relief from waiver of objections is warranted.
