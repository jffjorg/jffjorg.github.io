BACKGROUND    On January 19, 2024,  Plaintiffs Total Management Services America, Inc. (“TMSA”), Global Data  Innovators, Inc. (“GDI”), Takako Shimakage, and Maya Ono (collectively “Plaintiffs”)  filed the operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) against Defendants E-Shop  Labo LLC, Miwa Tamura, and Keisuke Shimada (collectively “Defendants”) for  Breach of Written Contract and Declaratory Relief.     Defendants filed a  Second Amended Cross-Complaint (“SAXC”) against Plaintiffs, Takayuki Sasaki  (“Sasaki”), and DOES 1-10, inclusive for: (1) Breach of Contract – Joint  Venture/Partnership Agreement; (2) Breach of Fiduciary Duty; (3) Breach of  Contract; (4) Breach of Contract; (5) Intentional Misrepresentation; (6)  Promissory Estoppel; (7) Quantum Meruit; and (8) Declaratory  Relief.     II. MOTIONS BEFORE  THE COURT   (1)    On December 21, 2023, Defendants filed a motion for  order compelling Plaintiff GDI to provide verified, code-compliant responses, without objection to  Defendant’s RPD Nos. 25-36, served on October 24, 2023 (CRS 1401).    (2)   On January 8, 2024,  Defendants filed a motion for order compelling Plaintiff GDI to provide verified, code-compliant responses, without  objection to Defendant’s RPD Nos. 25-36, served on October 24, 2023 (CRS 4857).  On February 20, 2024, Plaintiff GDI filed an opposition. On February 27, 2024,  Defendants filed a reply.     (3)    On December 21, 2023, Defendants filed a motion for  order compelling Plaintiff TMSA to provide verified, code-compliant responses, without objection to  Defendant’s RPD Nos. 25-36, served on October 24, 2023 (CRS 0230).    (4)    On February 20, 2024, Cross-Defendant Sasaki filed a motion  for order granting relief from waiver of objections (CRS 6139). On May 13,  2024, Defendants filed an opposition. On May 20, 2024, Cross-Defendant Sasaki  filed a reply.     As to CRS 1401 and 4857, these motions  appear duplicative and, therefore, the Court will address the motions together.  Both motions are DENIED.    As to CRS 0230, on June 18, 2024, the  Court denied Defendants’ motion that is duplicative of CRS 0230, and,  therefore, CRS 2030 is also DENIED.[1] The Court need not further  address the motion.    As to CRS 6139, on June 10, 2024, the  Court appears to have already granted Cross-Defendant  Sasaki’s motion for order granting relief from waiver of objections (CRS 6139).  However, the Court will still address the motion, which is GRANTED.       III.  ANALYSIS    CRS 1401 and 4857: Defendants request  an order compelling Plaintiff GDI to provide verified,  code-compliant responses, without objection to Defendant’s RPD Nos.  25-36, served on October 24, 2023.   A.                   Request for Production of Documents   Code of Civil Procedure Section 2031.310 provides, in pertinent part, as  follows:    (a)¿On receipt of a  response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the  demanding party may move for an order compelling further response to the demand  if the demanding party deems that any of the following apply:  (1)¿A statement of  compliance with the demand is incomplete.  (2)¿A representation  of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.  (3)¿An objection in  the response is without merit or too general.  (b)¿A  motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with both of the following:  (1)¿The  motion shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the  discovery sought by the demand.  (2)¿The  motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.    A code-compliant response to a request for production consists of any of  the following: (1) a statement that the party will comply, (2) a representation  that the party lacks the ability to comply, or (3) an objection. (Code  Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.210.) A statement that the party will comply must  state that the Request for Production (“RPD”) “will be allowed either in whole  or in part, and that all documents or things in the demanded category that are  in the possession, custody, or control of that party and to which no objection  is being made will be included in the production.” (Code Civ. Proc.,  §  2031.220.) “If only part of an item or category of item in a demand for  inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is objectionable, the response shall  contain a statement of compliance, or a representation of inability to comply  with respect to the remainder of that item or category.” (Code Civ.  Proc.,  § 2031.240(a).) If an objection is made the responding party must  “[i]dentify with particularity any document, tangible thing, land, or  electronically stored information falling within any category of item in the  demand to which an objection is being made.” (Code Civ. Proc.,  §  2031.240(b)(1).)    B.                   Meet and Confer   Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 2031.310(b)(2) a motion to  compel further responses to a request for production “shall be accompanied by a  meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(b)(2).) “A meet and  confer declaration in support of a motion shall state facts showing a  reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue  presented by the motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., §  2016.040.)      Here, Defendants did not meet and confer prior to bringing the instant  motion to compel further responses. The declaration of defense counsel  only indicates that the parties met and conferred to receive initial responses.  (12/21/23, 1/08/24 Keech Decl. ¶¶6-10, Exs. C-E.)     C.                   RPD Nos. 25-36   “All DOCUMENTS and COMMUNICATIONS that support or refute, and/or refer,  relate, or pertain to YOUR first cause of action against DEFENDANT in YOUR  COMPLAINT.” (RPD No. 25.)    “All DOCUMENTS and COMMUNICATIONS that support or refute, and/or refer,  relate, and/or pertain to YOUR second cause of action in YOUR COMPLAINT.” (RPD  No. 26.)    “All DOCUMENTS and COMMUNICATIONS that support or refute, and/or refer,  relate, and/or pertain to YOUR third cause of action in YOUR COMPLAINT.” (RPD  No. 27.)    “All DOCUMENTS and COMMUNICATIONS that support or refute, and/or refer,  relate, and/or pertain to YOUR fourth cause of action in YOUR COMPLAINT.” (RPD  No. 28.)    “All DOCUMENTS and COMMUNICATIONS between YOU and any other person and/or  individual that refer, relate, or pertain to the development of the adult  website and related business services as contained in YOUR COMPLAINT and the  CROSS-COMPLAINT.” (RPD No. 29.)    “All DOCUMENTS and COMMUNICATIONS that refer, relate, or pertain to each  discussion YOU had with DEFENDANTS regarding the development of the adult  website and related business services as contained in YOUR COMPLAINT and the  CROSS-COMPLAINT.” (RPD No. 30.)    “All DOCUMENTS and COMMUNICATIONS that refer, relate, or pertain to the  Development Agreement, the Profit Share Addendum, the Asset Purchase Agreement,  the Bill of Sale, and the Agreement for New Project, as contained in YOUR  COMPLAINT and the CROSSCOMPLAINT.” (RPD No. 31.)    “Any and all non-privileged DOCUMENTS and COMMUNICATIONS between YOU and  any other person and/or individual that relate, refer, and/or PERTAIN TO  DEFENDANTS.” (RPD No. 32.)    “All DOCUMENTS and COMMUNICATIONS that memorialize any and all  discussions, conversations, correspondence, and the like with any witnesses to  the allegations contained in YOUR COMPLAINT.” (RPD No. 33.)    “All DOCUMENTS and COMMUNICATIONS that support or refuse, and/or refer,  relate, or PERTAIN TO any and all damages YOU allege in YOUR COMPLAINT.” (RPD  No. 34.)    “Any and all written or recorded statements YOU have obtained from any  individual concerning the subject matter of the COMPLAINT.” (RPD No. 35.)    “All DOCUMENTS YOU relied on, reviewed, or referred to in responding to  DEFENDANTS’ Form Interrogatories, Set One.” (RPD No. 36.)    In response to these requests, Plaintiff GDI initially responded  identically by objecting to the use of the terms “DEFENDANT” and “YOUR” as  vague, ambiguous, overbroad, and unduly burdensome. Plaintiff GDI also objects  to the grounds of attorney-client privilege, attorney work product doctrine,  and privacy to the extent the information sought is protected under these  privileges. Moreover, Plaintiff GDI objects to the extent the requests seek  production of documents that are already in the possession of Defendants.  Additionally, Plaintiff GDI states it has produced all relevant, non-privileged  responsive documents in his possession, custody, or control located after a  reasonably diligent search and produced further documents also responsive to  these requests that are not identified on the privilege log submitted to  Defendants on November 27, 2023. (Response to RPD Nos. 25-36.)    Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 2031.300(a), “[t]he party to  whom the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed  waives any objection to the demand, including one based on privilege or on the  protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section  2018.010).” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300(a).) However, the Court may relieve  that party from this waiver on its determination that: “[t]he party has  subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections  2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280” and “[t]he party’s  failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or  excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300(a)(1)-(2).)    Here, Plaintiff GDI was served with Defendants’ Request for Production of  Documents, Set Two on October 24, 2023. (12/21/23, 1/08/24 Keech Decl. ¶5, Ex.  B.) As such, Plaintiff GDI had until November 27, 2023 to provide verified  responses to RPD, Set Two because it would be 30 days after service of the  production demand per Code of Civil Procedure Section 2031.260(a). Plaintiff GDI  does not dispute that she served untimely responses on December 15, 2023.  However, Plaintiff GDI provided supplemental responses on February 22, 2024.  (Reply at 2:12-13, fn. 1.) Also, Plaintiff GDI’s Motion for Relief from Waiver  of Objections was granted on June 10, 2024.     Therefore, Defendants’ motion has been rendered moot.          CRS 6139: Cross-Defendant  Sasaki requests an order granting relief from waiver of objections to Defendants’ requests for production, set two (“RFPs”). This motion is  made on the grounds that Cross-Defendant Sasaki has substantially compliant  responses to Defendants’ RFPs and Cross-Defendant Sasaki’s failure to serve a  timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable  neglect.     A.          Relief from Waiver of Objections   Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 2031.300(a), “[t]he party to  whom the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed  waives any objection to the demand, including one based on privilege or on the  protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section  2018.010).” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300(a).) However, the Court may relieve  that party from this waiver on its determination that: “[t]he party has  subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections  2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280” and “[t]he party’s  failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or  excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300(a)(1)-(2).)    Here, Cross-Defendant Sasaki’s supplemental responses are in substantial  compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280.  Specifically, Cross-Defendant Sasaki’s responses indicate either  Cross-Defendant Sasaki will comply with a particular request, represents lack  of ability to comply with a request after diligent search and a reasonable  inquiry, asserts objections to particular requests, and specifically identifies  responsive documents that have already produced as required by the cited code  sections. (2/20/24 Flores Decl. ¶ 9, Exs. B-F.) Furthermore, Defendants’  assert that verifications to the supplemental responses were provided on  February 22, 2024. (Opp. 3:23-28, 4:1-3, fn. 1.) Cross-Defendant Sasaki’s  counsel also declares under the penalty of perjury that they mistakenly failed  to notice the email from defense counsel concerning the subject discovery  requests because the e-mail did not indicate it was service of the RFPs and did  not copy the firm’s assistant, Kent Easter, who reminds counsel of such matters  and had been CC’d on previous matters concerning this case. (2/20/24 Flores  Decl. ¶¶ 2-3.) Cross-Defendant Sasaki’s counsel further attests to the fact  that the mistake went unnoticed until an email exchange with defense counsel,  which occurred on December 6, 2023. (Id., ¶¶ 3, 5-6, Ex. A.) A  reasonably prudent person under similar circumstances could neglect to such  email if it failed to note it was purported service of discovery requests and  did not copy a firm’s assistant on the case responsible of scheduling such matters.  As such, Cross-Defendant Sasaki provided evidence that its failure to serve  timely responses were due to the inadvertence and mistake of counsel of  record.     Therefore, Court finds that Cross-Defendant Sasaki has shown that relief  from waiver of objections is warranted.      IV.  DISPOSITION    Defendants  E-Shop Labo LLC, Miwa Tamura, and Keisuke Shimada’s Motion to Compel Responses  to Request for Production, Set Two, against Plaintiff GDI are DENIED as  moot (CRS 1401 and 4857).   Defendants  E-Shop Labo LLC, Miwa Tamura, and Keisuke Shimada’s Motion to Compel Further  Responses to Request for Production, Set Two, against Plaintiff TMSA is DENIED (CRS 0230). Cross-Defendant  Takayuki Sasaki’s Motion for Relief from Waiver of Objections is GRANTED  (CRS 6139).
