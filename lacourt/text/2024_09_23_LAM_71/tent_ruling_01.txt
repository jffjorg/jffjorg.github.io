JAMES
  LYLE,  
  
         vs.
 
EMILY
  ANN SMITH.


 Case No.: 
  23STCV28116
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  June 14, 2024



 
Defendant
Emily Ann Smith’s motion for an order dismissing this action on the grounds of
forum non conveniens is granted.  Plaintiff
James Lyle’s action is dismissed with prejudice.

 
Defendant Emily Ann Smith (“Smith”)
(“Defendant”) moves for an order dismissing this action on the grounds of forum
non conveniens.  (Notice of Motion, pgs.
1-2.)
 
Background
Plaintiff James Lyle (“Lyle”) (“Plaintiff”)
filed his operative Complaint on November 16, 2023, alleging three causes of
action against Defendant: (1) conversion; (2) breach of fiduciary duties; and (3)
money had and received.  Defendant filed
her Answer on January 8, 2024.
Defendant filed the instant motion on June 25,
2024.  Plaintiff filed his opposition on September
10, 2024.  Defendant filed her reply on September
16, 2024.
 
Legal Standard
Even if the court has subject matter and
personal jurisdiction, it may stay or dismiss the action on the ground of
inconvenient forum.  (C.C.P. §418.10(a)(2).)
If the
court finds that “in the interest of substantial justice” an action filed in
California should be adjudicated elsewhere, it may stay or dismiss the action
on such conditions as may be just.  (C.C.P.
§410.30(a).)
C.C.P.
§410.30(a) codifies the common law doctrine of forum non conveniens.  Forum non conveniens is not a jurisdictional
doctrine; rather, it is “an equitable doctrine invoking the discretionary power
of a court to decline to exercise the jurisdiction [to stay or dismiss] it has
over a transitory cause of action when it believes that the action may be more
appropriately and justly tried elsewhere.”  (Stangvik v. Shiley Inc. (1991) 54 Cal.3d
744, 751; In re Christopher B. (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 551, 559.)
Defendant
bears the burden of proof, meaning defendant must provide the trial court with
sufficient evidence to enable it to carry out its weighing and balancing
analysis.  (National Football League
v. Fireman’s Fund Insurance Co. (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 902, 926-927, 933 n.15.)
Plaintiff’s
choice of forum will not be disturbed unless the court is convinced: (1) a
“suitable” alternative forum exists; and (2) the balance of private and public
interest factors makes it “just” that the litigation proceed in the alternative
forum.  (Stangvik, 54 Cal.3d 744,
751; Morris v. AGFA Corp. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1452, 1463.)
Where
plaintiff is a California resident for purposes of forum non conveniens, there
is a “strong presumption” in favor of plaintiff’s choice of forum. (See id.;
Stangvik, 54 Cal.3d 744, 754 [noting that factors underlying “strong
presumption” test apply only to residents of forum state].)
The
fact the defendant may have consented or submitted to California jurisdiction
does not prevent it from moving to stay or dismiss the action on forum non
conveniens grounds.  (Appalachian
Insurance Co. v. Superior Court (1984) 162 Cal.App.3d 427, 440.)
 
Discussion
Defendant’s motion is granted.
Defendant
met her burden to demonstrate a suitable alternative forum exists.  First, Defendant sufficiently demonstrates
New York is a suitable alternative forum: Defendant’s primary duties as
Plaintiff’s personal assistant were carried out in New York City, all witnesses
to the alleged acts and employment relationship in the operative Complaint
reside in New York, and Plaintiff can counter-sue Defendant in New York for
personal injuries.  (Decl. of Smith ¶¶5,
7, 13.)  Plaintiff’s claims are not
barred by the three-year the statute of limitations in New York’s Civil
Practice Law and Rules (“CPLR”) §214(3) for a cause of action for conversion or
CPLR §214(4) for a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty, or the
six-year statute of limitations for money had and received in CPLR §213.  Further, Plaintiff has pursued his claims
against Defendant in New York, specifically the July 10, 2024, mediation
scheduled in New York.  (Decl. of Smith
¶12.) 
Defendant
sufficiently shifted the burden to Plaintiff to show that New York would be an
unsuitable forum despite Defendant being amenable to process and no procedural
bars to a New York court reaching a decision on the merit.  (See Hahn v. Diaz-Barba (2011) 194
Cal.App.4th 1177, 1191.)  Plaintiff fails
to demonstrate New York would be an unsuitable forum based on his speculative argument
that the Southern District of New York (“SDNY”) could potentially determine
that his failure to raise a compulsory counterclaim earlier in Defendant’s
lawsuit would leave him without any forum to seek redress.  (Opposition, pg. 3.)  Further, Plaintiff provides no evidence to
support his argument that Defendant has attempted to evade service of the
compulsory counterclaim in her SDNY lawsuit, or more importantly, that he has
filed a compulsory counterclaim in the SDNY lawsuit.  Further, there is no such factor on the first
prong of the instant analysis that considers whether service on the defendant
in the alternative forum renders the alternative forum inappropriate.
Second,
the totality of the public and private factors support dismissal in favor of a
more convenient forum in New York.  Here,
the evidence and witnesses are located in New York, and the events that are the
subject of this action occurred predominantly in New York; there is no showing of
any evidence in this matter is tethered to the State of California.  (See Complaint.)  Further, the burden of having to determine and
apply New York law in this Court for choice-of-law analysis and substantively to
Plaintiff’s claims is a strong factor favoring dismissal.  (See Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno (1981)
454 U.S. 235, 260 [“the need to apply foreign law pointed towards dismissal”].)
 The application of New York law in this
Court would be especially time-consuming.  Finally, California does not have an interest
in having the case heard here: the parties’ relationship was entered into in
New York; the parties reside in New York; the witnesses reside in New York; New
York law applies.  (Tucci v. Club
Mediterranee, S.A. (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 180, 193; Castro v. Budget
Rent-a-Car Systems, Inc. (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 1162, 1180-1182.)  That forum has an interest in ensuring that
the parties are held to the standards set out in its case and statutory law.
This
Court should not bear the burden of presiding over this foreign case, in light
of this Court’s already congested docket.  “[P]reventing court congestion resulting from
the trial of foreign causes of action is an important factor in the forum non
conveniens analysis.”  (Stangvik,
54 Cal.3d at pg. 758.)
Accordingly,
Defendant’s motion is granted. 
Plaintiff’s action is dismissed with prejudice.
 
Conclusion
Defendant’s motion is granted.  The instant matter is dismissed with
prejudice.
Moving Party to give notice.
