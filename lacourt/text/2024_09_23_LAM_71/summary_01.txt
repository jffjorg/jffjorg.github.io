```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to dismiss the action on the grounds of forum non conveniens. The defendant has demonstrated that New York is a suitable alternative forum, where the events that are the subject of this action occurred predominantly, the witnesses reside, and the parties' relationship was entered into. The judge has found that the totality of the public and private factors supports dismissal in favor of a more convenient forum in New York. The judge has also noted that California does not have an interest in having the case heard in California, and that the court should not bear the burden of presiding over a foreign case, in light of the court's already congested docket. The plaintiff's action is dismissed with prejudice.
