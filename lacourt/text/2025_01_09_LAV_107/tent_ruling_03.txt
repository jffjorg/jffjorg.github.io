Tentative Ruling Deny
 
 
I.               
BACKGROUND
 
On September 16, 2024, Plaintiff
Tag Holdings Corporation (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants
David Benzaken, Basad Corporation, Sapir Razla, Raz Razla, and Does 1 through
10, alleging causes of action for: (1) breach of contract; and (2) indemnification.
 
Plaintiff filed two proofs of
service showing Defendants Raz Razla and Sapir Razla (“Defendants”) were served
by substituted service on October 23, 2024. (Proofs of Service filed 11/04/24.)
 
On December 6, 2024, Defendants filed
a motion to quash service of summons (the ‘Motion”). On December 26, 2024,
Plaintiff filed an opposition. On January 2, 2025, Defendants filed a reply.
 
II.            
DEFENDANTS’
REQUESTS FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
Defendants request this court
take judicial notice of the proofs of summons. (Request for Judicial Notice p.
2.) 
 
The court need not take judicial
notice of a documents that are part of the case file. Thus, Defendants’ requests
for judicial notice are denied.
 
III.           
PLAINTIFF’S
REQUESTS FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
Plaintiff requests this court
take judicial notice of Defendant Raz Razla’s California Department of Real
Estate License Information. (Request for Judicial Notice p. 2.)
 
Evidence Code section 452,
subdivision (c) permits the court to take judicial notice of “[o]fficial acts
of the legislative, executive, and judicial departments of the United States
and of any state of the United States.” This includes taking judicial notice of
a license issued by a state agency. (See Arroyo v. Plosay (2014) 225
Cal.App.4th 279, 296 [stating a “Hospital’s license issued by the State
Department of Public Health was properly subject to judicial notice under
Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (c)[.]”].)  
 
Thus, Plaintiff’s request for
judicial notice is granted.
 
IV.          
DEFENDANTS’
OBJECTIONS
 
Defendants raise five objections
to evidence submitted with Plaintiff’s opposition:
 

Objection No. 1. Cosgrove Declaration,
     Paragraph 1: page 1, lines 26-27, stating: “A true and correct copy of the
     Notice of Acknowledgement and Receipt that was mailed to Raz Razla on
     September 25, 2024 is attached as Exhibit 1.” 
Objection No. 2: Cosgrove Declaration,
     Paragraph 4: page 2, lines 7-9, stating: “A true and correct copy of the
     website showing Raz Razla was listed as an employee at HML Investments as
     of December 10, 2024, and its address is 15391 Chatsworth Street, Granada
     Hills, California, is attached as Exhibit 4.” 
Objection No. 3: Cosgrove Declaration,
     Paragraph 5: page 2, lines 10-11, stating: “A true and correct copy of the
     Notice of Acknowledgement and Receipt that was mailed to Sapir Razla on
     September 25, 2024 is attached as Exhibit 5.”
Objection No. 4: Cosgrove Declaration,
     Paragraph 6: page 2, lines 12-14, stating: “A true and correct copy of the
     results of a skip trace for Sapir Razla showing her address to be 14151
     Chandler Boulevard, Sherman Oaks, California 91401, is attached as Exhibit
     6.” 
Objection No. 5: Cosgrove Declaration,
     Paragraph 7: page 2, lines 15-16, stating: “A true and correct copy of a
     proof of service in LASC Case No. 24CHLC05154, that showed Sapir Razla was
     served at 14151 Chandler Boulevard, Sherman Oaks, California 91401 on
     March 22, 2024, is attached as Exhibit 7.”

 
This court overrules Defendants’
objections.
 
V.             
TIMELINESS
 
“A defendant,
on or before the last day of his or her time to plead or within any further
time that the court may for good cause allow, may serve and file a notice of
motion. . . [t]o quash service of summons[.]” (Code Civ. Proc., §
418.10(a)(1).) Generally, a responsive pleading is due within thirty days after
service of the summons. (Code Civ. Proc., § 412.20(a)(3).) When a party is
served by substitute service, “[s]ervice . . . is deemed complete on the 10th
day after the mailing.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.20(a).)
 
Plaintiff filed proofs of service
showing Defendants were served by substituted service on October 23, 2024.
(Proofs of Service filed 11/24/24.) The documents were mailed to Defendants
that same day. (Proofs of Service filed 11/24/24.)  Accordingly, service was deemed complete on
November 2, 2024, and a responsive pleading was due by December 2, 2024.
 
However, Defendants submit an
email from Plaintiff’s counsel stating that “Requests for entry of default will
be filed if answers are not filed by December 6, 2024.” (Ex. 1 p. 1.)
 
Accordingly, this court finds the
Motion was timely filed.
 
VI.          
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
“A defendant, .
. . may serve and file a notice of motion…to quash service of summons on the
ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her.” (Cal. Code Civ.
Proc., §¿418.10(a)(1).) 
 
When a
defendant moves to quash service of the summons and complaint, the plaintiff
has “the burden of proving the facts that did give the court jurisdiction, that
is the facts requisite to an effective service.” (Coulston v. Cooper
(1966) 245 Cal.App.2d 866, 868.) The plaintiff must establish the facts of
jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. (Aquila, Inc. v. Superior
Court (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 556, 568.) 
 
“The filing of
a proof of service declaration ordinarily creates a rebuttable presumption that
the service was proper, but only if the service declaration ‘complies with the
statutory requirements regarding such proofs.’” (Lebel v. Mai (2012) 210
Cal.App.4th 1154, 1164.) That presumption may be rebutted by contrary evidence
submitted by a defendant. (Fernandes v. Singh (2017) 16 Cal.App.5th 932,
941, fn. 6.)¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
If service of
summons is not properly and validly effectuated by one or more of the approved
methods, California courts lack personal jurisdiction over the defendants, and
any judicial actions taken without such service violates principles of
fundamental due process and is therefore void. (County of San Diego v.
Gorham (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 1215, 1226-1227.)¿
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 415.20, subdivision (a), states:
 
In lieu of personal delivery of a copy of
the summons and complaint to the person to be served as specified in Section 416.10, 416.20, 416.30, 416.40, or 416.50, a summons may be served by leaving a copy of the
summons and complaint during usual office hours in his or her office or, if no
physical address is known, at his or her usual mailing address, other than a
United States Postal Service post office box, with the person who is apparently
in charge thereof, and by thereafter mailing a copy of the summons and
complaint by first-class mail, postage prepaid to the person to be served at
the place where a copy of the summons and complaint were left. When service is
effected by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint at a mailing address,
it shall be left with a person at least 18 years of age, who shall be informed
of the contents thereof. Service of a summons in this manner is deemed complete
on the 10th day after the mailing.
 
“[A]n
individual may be served by substitute service only after a good faith effort
at personal service has first been made: the burden is on the plaintiff to show
that the summons and complaint ‘cannot with reasonable diligence be personally
delivered’ to the individual defendant. [Citations] Two or three attempts to
personally serve a defendant at a proper place ordinarily qualifies as
‘reasonable diligence.’” (American Express Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011)
199 Cal.App.4th 383, 389.)
 
VII.        
DISCUSSION
 
Defendants argue this court has
no personal jurisdiction over Defendants because Plaintiff’s proofs of service
“indicate that Plaintiff only attempted personal service one time before leaving the documents with Jane
‘Lynette’ Doe[.]” (Motion p. 2, original underlining, bolding, and italics.)
 
On November 4, 2024, Plaintiff
submitted proofs of service showing Defendants were served by substituted
service on October 23, 2024. (Proofs of Service filed 11/04/24.) The attached
declarations of diligence indicate Plaintiff only attempted personal service
once before serving Defendants via substituted service. (Proofs of Service filed
11/04/24 pdf p. 3.) Accordingly, the proofs of service do not show that the
summons and complaint could not “with reasonable diligence be personally delivered”
to Defendants.   (See American Express Centurion Bank v. Zara, supra, 199
Cal.App.4th at p. 389.) Thus, the proofs of service filed on November 4, 2024, do
not create a rebuttable presumption that service was proper.
 
Plaintiff seeks to cure this defect by submitting
with its opposition two declarations of diligence showing Plaintiff’s process
server made four unsuccessful attempts to serve Defendants at their residence
before serving Defendants by substitute service at their business address. (Cosgrove
Declaration ¶¶ 2-3, 8; Ex. 2; Ex 8.)
 
In the reply, Defendants argue the declarations of
diligence Plaintiff submits with the opposition are insufficient because “not one of the documents
attached to the December 26, 2024, Declaration of Phillip R. Cosgrove . . .
bears a stamp indicating that Plaintiff submitted the document for filing to
the Court” and “Court rules require that a proof of service, in proper form,
attesting to proper service be filed with the court.” (Reply p. 2, original underlining, bolding, and italics.))
 
Defendants cite Code of Civil Procedure section
417.30, which states: “After a
summons has been served on a person, proof of service of the
summons as provided in Section
417.10 or 417.20 shall be filed, unless the defendant has previously made a
general appearance.” Defendants also cite Code of Civil Procedure section
417.10, that discusses the manner in which a proof of summons can be served on
a person within California.
 
The statutes cited above do not state that a proof
of service must be filed with the court as a separate document. Defendants cite
no other authority for the proposition a proof of service must be filed with
the court as a separate document. Accordingly, this court is not persuaded by
Defendants’ argument that Plaintiff’s declarations of diligence are invalid.
 
VIII.     
 CONCLUSION
 
For the foregoing reasons, this
court denies Defendants’ Motion.
