I.               
BACKGROUND
On December 6, 2023, Defendants Saro
Dereghishian and Sami’s Auto Body Inc. (“Defendants”) hired Plaintiff Sason
Catering Inc. (“Plaintiff”) to cater an event. (Complaint ¶ 12.) Defendants and Plaintiff signed a contract, which
required Defendants to pay Plaintiff $42,645 for Plaintiff’s services.
(Complaint ¶ 13.) Defendants’
checks bounced. (Complaint ¶¶ 13, 15.) On April
26, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendants Saro Dereghishian, Sami’s Auto Body Inc., and
Does 1 through 10, alleging five causes of action for: (1) breach of written
contract; (2) account stated; (3) services rendered; (4) quantum meruit; and
(5) fraud (promise without intent to perform).
 
On September 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
motion to deem its Requests for Admission (“RFAs”), Set No. One admitted against
Defendant Saro Dereghishian (“Defendant”).
 
On October 31, 2024, Plaintiff filed motions
to compel Defendant’s responses to Requests for Production of Documents,
Special Interrogatories, and Form Interrogatories. 
 
On November 6, 2024, Defendant filed an
opposition to the motion to deem RFAs admitted. Defendant filed no opposition
to the motions to compel Defendant’s responses to Requests for Production of
Documents, Special Interrogatories, or Form Interrogatories.
I.               
MOTION
TO DEEM RFAS ADMITTED
 
a.    
Meet
and Confer
 
There
is no requirement that parties meet and confer before bringing a deemed
admitted motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280. (St. Mary v.
Superior Court (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 777.) 
 
Because Plaintiff states
no response was provided to the instant discovery request, there is no
requirement for the parties to have met and conferred.¿(Motion to Deem RFAS
Admitted p. 3.)
 
b.    
Legal
Standard
 
When
a party fails to timely respond to a request for admission, the propounding
party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth
of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280(b).)  The party who failed to respond waives any objections to
the requests, unless the court grants them relief from the waiver, upon a
showing that the party (1) “ has subsequently served a response that is in
substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230”; and
(2) the “failure
to serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or
excusable neglect.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(a)(1)-(2).)¿  
 
The
court shall grant a motion to deem admitted requests for admissions, “unless it
finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”¿ (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(c).)¿
 
Where
a party fails to provide a timely response to requests for admission, “[i]t is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”¿
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(c).)¿ 
 
c.     
Discussion
 
Plaintiff
served its RFAs to Defendant on August 7, 2024, by mail and email. (Javaheri
Declaration ¶ 4; Ex. 1.) Responses to RFAs are due within thirty days after
service, unless the court has shortened or extended the time to respond. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.250(a).) When discovery is served by mail to an address
within California, the time to respond is extended by five calendar days. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1013(a).) Accordingly, Defendant Saro Dereghishian’s responses
were due by September 11, 2024. Defendant Saro Dereghishian submitted no
verified responses by that date. (Javheri Declaration ¶ 9.)
 
Defendant
submits a declaration stating Plaintiff served the RFAs to Defendant on August
7, 2024. (Dereghishian Declaration ¶ 2.) And “On September 7, 2024, Defendants
were granted an extension to provide responses no later than September 16,
2024.” (Dereghishian Declaration ¶ 3.) Defendant states Defendant served
Plaintiff with responses to the RFAs on September 16, 2024. (Dereghishian
Declaration ¶ 4.)
 
In
response, Plaintiff’s counsel submits a supplemental declaration stating that,
on September 13, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel told Defendant’s
“paralegal/mediator” that “there is no ‘extension’ to respond and explaining
that Defendants have waived any objections and must respond with actual
responses (no objections) by September 16, 2024 so Plaintiff is not forced to
file a Motion To Compel and Request for Sanctions, including Terminating
Sanctions[.]” (Javaheri Supplemental Declaration ¶ 5, bolding in original.)
These emails show that on September 13, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel told
Defendant “Please be advised that if Defendants do not provide actual responses
by Monday September 16, 2024, Plaintiff will be forced to make a Motion To
Compel and Request for Sanctions, including Terminating Sanctions.” Defendant
responded by emailing: “thank you for the extension and thank you for your
cooperation throughout this matter and noted that the responses are due on or
before September 16, 2024.” Plaintiff then responded: “Just to be clear, there
is no "extension" to respond. Defendants have waived any objections
and must respond with actual responses (no objections) by September 16, 2024 so
Plaintiff is not forced to file a Motion To Compel and Request for Sanctions,
including Terminating Sanctions.” All of these communications are dated
September 13, 2024.
 
Although
the initial September 13 email is ambiguous re: whether Plaintiff was agreeing
to an extension, the subsequent email clarifies that Plaintiff was not agreeing
to an extension - but merely stating Plaintiff would file the motions if
Defendant did not provide responses without objections.
Plaintiff
submits the email correspondence as an exhibit. (Javaheri Supplemental
Declaration Ex. 1.) On September 19, 2024, after Plaintiff filed the motion to
deem RFAs admitted, Plaintiff received Defendant’s “objection-only ‘responses,’
with no admissions or denials.” (Javaheri Supplemental Declaration ¶ 6.)
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.260, subdivision (a) provides that “(a)
The party requesting admissions and the responding party may agree to extend
the time for service of a response to a set of admission requests, or to
particular requests in a set, to a date beyond that provided in Section 2033.250.” Subdivision (b) provides that “This
agreement may be informal, but it shall be confirmed in a writing that
specifies the extended date for service of a response.” Although Defendant
submits a declaration stating Defendant received an extension to timely file
responses to the RFAs, Defendant submits no writing showing the parties agreed
to an extension. In contrast, Plaintiff submits an email showing Plaintiff did
not agree to an extension. (Javaheri Supplemental Declaration Ex. 1.)
Defendant
also states Defendant timely served Plaintiff with the responses on September
16, 2024. However, Defendant has not submitted Defendant’s responses to the
RFAs to this court, so this court cannot determine whether Defendant’s
responses were in substantial compliance with section 2033.220. (See Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280(c).) 
 
Accordingly,
Plaintiff is entitled to an order deeming its RFAs, Set One, admitted against Defendant.
 
d.    
Sanctions
 
Plaintiff
seeks $2,608.91 in monetary sanctions against Defendant. (Motion to Deem RFAs
Admitted p. 7.) This includes $68.91 in filing fees, four hours of attorneys’
fees for preparing the motion, and one hour for appearing at the hearing.
(Javheri Declaration ¶ 9.)
 
Defendant
did not timely respond to Plaintiff’s RFAs, Set One. Accordingly, sanctions are
mandatory. However, this court finds that four hours in attorneys’ fees for
preparing the motion is excessive, given the motion’s simplicity. 
 
Thus,
Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions is granted in the reduced amount of
$1,268.51, reflecting $68.51 in filing fees, two hours for preparing the
motion, and one hour for appearing at the time, at $400.00 per hour. 
 
II.            
MOTION
TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS
 
a.    
Meet
and Confer and Timeliness
 
Plaintiff
submits a separate statement stating they are seeking to compel Defendant’s
“further responses/amended responses” but given Defendant did not timely serve
Plaintiff with responses, this court finds that this should be a motion to
compel, not a motion to compel further.
Within
the separate statement, Plaintiff correctly points out that Defendant waived
objections by not timely serving Plaintiff with responses. (See e.g., Separate
Statement p. 2.) Regardless, the motion was timely.
 
“Unlike
a¿motion¿to¿compel¿further¿responses, a¿motion¿to¿compel¿responses is
not subject to a 45–day time limit, and the propounding party does not have to
demonstrate either good cause or that it satisfied a ‘meet¿and¿confer’
requirement.” (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.)
 
Plaintiff’s
counsel submits a declaration stating they sent Defendant a meet and confer
letter requesting supplemental responses, but Defendant failed to serve any
supplemental responses. (Javaheri Declaration ¶ 5.) Further, even if the motion
to compel responses to Requests for Production was subject to the forty-five
day time limit, Plaintiff filed the motion within forty-five days of receiving
Defendant’s responses. (See Javaheri Declaration ¶ 4.)
¿¿ 
b.    
Legal
Standard
 
“I]f
a party to whom¿a¿demand¿for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling¿is
directed fails to serve a timely response to it,… [t]he party to whom
the¿demand¿for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling¿is directed waives any
objection to the demand [and]…[t]he party making the demand may move for an
order compelling response to the¿demand.” (Code Civ. Proc. §¿2031.300.) “The
court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination
that . . . (1) The party has subsequently served a response that is in
substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240,
and 2031.280. [and] (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response was the
result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300(a).)¿¿ 
 
“[T]he
court shall impose a monetary sanction . . . against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the
one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300(c).¿ 
 
c.     
Discussion
 
On
August 7, 2024, Plaintiff served Defendant with Plaintiff’s Request for
Production. (Javaheri Declaration ¶ 2; Ex. 1 pdf p. 22.) On September 7, 2024,
Defendant’s “paralegal/mediator” requested an extension to respond. (Javaheri
Declaration ¶ 3.) On September 13, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel responded: ““[t]o
date, Plaintiff has not received responses to the discovery requests sent to
Defendant on August 7, 2024. Please note that Defendants have waived any
objections and must respond. Please be advised that Defendants do not
provide actual responses by Monday September 16, 2024, Plaintiff will be forced
to make a Motion To Compel and Request for Sanctions, including Terminating
Sanctions” (Javaheri Declaration ¶ 3, bolding in original.) On September
23, 2024, Plaintiff “received mostly objection-only responses[.]” (Javaheri
Declaration ¶ 4.) The proof of service accompanying the objections stated the
responses were served on September 16, 2024. (Javaheri Declaration ¶ 4.) But
the envelope was postmarked September 19, 2024. (Javaheri Declaration ¶ 4.)
Plaintiff’s counsel sent a meet and confer letter to Plaintiff’s
“paralegal/mediator” stating that “[t]o avoid Plaintiff having to file a
motion to compel on Thursday October 31, 2024, serve Supplemental Actual
Responses, without Objections, to Defendant Saro Dereghishian’s “Responses” to
Plaintiff’s Requests for Production (inducting actual production of documents),
Requests for Form Interrogatories and Requests for Special Interrogatories
specified above, on or before the close of business on Tuesday October 29, 2024.”
(Javaheri Declaration ¶ 5, bolding and underlining in original.)
 
Plaintiff
served Defendant with Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories by mail and email on
August 7, 2024. Responses are due “[w]ithin 30 days after service of a demand
for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling[.]” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.260(a).) “In case of service by mail . . . [s]ervice is complete at the
time of the deposit, but any period of notice and any right or duty to do any
act or make any response within any period or on a date certain after service
of the document, which time period or date is prescribed by statute or rule of
court, shall be extended five calendar days . . . if the place of address and
place of mailing is within the State of California[.]” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1013(a).)  Thirty days after August 7,
2024, plus five calendar days for service by mail, was September 11, 2024. Plaintiff’s
counsel told Defendant “there is no ‘extension’ to respond.” (Javaheri
Declaration Ex. 2 p. 1.) Thus, even if Defendant served Plaintiff with the
responses on September 16, 2024, and not when the envelope was postmarked on
September 19, 2024, Defendant’s responses were untimely.
 
The
court may relieve a party from its waiver if: “(1) The party has subsequently
served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210,
2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280. [and] (2) The party’s failure to
serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300(a).)¿¿¿
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.240, subdivisions (b) and (c)(1) states that: 
 
(b) If the responding party objects to
the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling of an item or category
of item, the response shall do both of the following:
(1) Identify with particularity any
document, tangible thing, land, or electronically stored information falling
within any category of item in the demand to which an objection is being made.
(2) Set forth clearly the extent of,
and the specific ground for, the objection. If an objection is based on a claim
of privilege, the particular privilege invoked shall be stated. If an objection
is based on a claim that the information sought is protected work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010), that
claim shall be expressly asserted.
(c)(1) If an objection is based on a
claim of privilege or a claim that the information sought is protected work
product, the response shall provide sufficient factual information for other
parties to evaluate the merits of that claim, including, if necessary, a
privilege log.
Defendant’s
untimely responses did not identify the document, tangible thing, land, or
electronically stored information falling within the category or set forth the
specific ground for the objections. (Javaheri Declaration Ex. 3 pdf pp. 31-53.)
 Defendant also raised the
attorney-client privilege and attorney work product doctrine, but Defendant did
not provide any factual information such that Plaintiff could evaluate the
merits of those objections. (See Javaheri Declaration Ex. 3 pdf pp. 31-53.)
Further, as to almost all the responses that Defendant provided responses to
without objections, Defendant simply repeated: “Plaintiff, has been paid in
full and acknowledged payment in full.” (Javaheri Declaration Ex. 2 pdf pp.
48-50.) That response was non-responsive to the applicable Requests for
Production. (Ex. 2 pdf pp.48-50.) Accordingly, this court finds that
Defendant’s untimely responses were not in substantial compliance with Sections
2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280. (See Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300(a).)
 
Defendant
has also not argued to this court that Defendant’s untimely responses were due
to mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.
 
Thus,
Defendant waived any objections to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production.
 
d.    
Sanctions
 
Plaintiff
seeks $1,460.00 in monetary sanctions against Defendant. (Javaheri Declaration ¶
7.) This includes the $60.00 motion filing fee and four hours of attorneys’
fees for preparing the meet and confer letter and motion and attending the
hearing. (Javaheri Declaration ¶ 7.) 
 
Defendant
did not timely respond to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production. This court finds
Defendant did not act with substantial justification and no other circumstances
makes awarding sanctions unjust. This court also finds that three hours in
attorneys’ fees for preparing the meet and confer letter and motion are
excessive, given the motion’s simplicity. 
 
Thus,
Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions is granted in the reduced amount of $1,110.00,
reflecting the $60.00 motion filing fee, two hours for preparing the motion and
supporting documents, and one hour for appearing at the hearing, at $350.00 per
hour.

“If

“The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its

c.     
Discussion
 
On
August 7, 2024, Plaintiff served Defendant with Plaintiff’s Special
Interrogatories by mail and email. (Javaheri Declaration ¶ 2; Ex. 1 pdf p. 30.)
On September 7, 2024, Defendant’s “paralegal/mediator” requested an extension
to respond. (Javaheri Declaration ¶ 3.) On September 13, 2024, Plaintiff’s
counsel responded: “[t]o date, Plaintiff has not received responses to the
discovery requests sent to Defendant on August 7, 2024. Please note that
Defendants have waived any objections and must respond. Please be advised
that Defendants do not provide actual responses by Monday September 16, 2024,
Plaintiff will be forced to make a Motion To Compel and Request for Sanctions,
including Terminating Sanctions.” (Javaheri Declaration ¶ 3, bolding in
original.) That same day, Plaintiff’s counsel sent another email “clarifying
that ‘there is no “extension” to respond’” and explaining Defendants waived any
objections. (Javaheri Declaration ¶ 3.) On September 23, 2024, Plaintiff
“received mostly objection-only responses[.]” (Javaheri Declaration ¶ 4.) The
proof of service stated the responses were sent on September 16, 2024, but the
envelope was postmarked September 19, 2024. (Javaheri Declaration ¶ 4.)
 
Plaintiff
served Defendant with Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories by mail and email on
August 7, 2024.  Responses are due
“[w]ithin 30 days after service of interrogatories[.]” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.260.) “In case of service by mail . . . [s]ervice is complete at the time
of the deposit, but any period of notice and any right or duty to do any act or
make any response within any period or on a date certain after service of the
document, which time period or date is prescribed by statute or rule of court,
shall be extended five calendar days . . . if the place of address and place of
mailing is within the State of California[.]” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1013(a).)  Thirty days after August 7,
2024, plus five calendar days for service by mail, was September 11, 2024.
Plaintiff’s counsel told Defendant “there is no ‘extension’ to respond.”
(Javaheri Declaration Ex. 2 p. 1.) Thus, even if Defendant served Plaintiff
with the responses on September 16, 2024, and not when the envelope was
postmarked on September 19, 2024, Defendant’s responses were untimely.
 
There are a
total of 131 Special Interrogatories. 
Defendant raised
some valid objections. Some of these Special Interrogatories do not appear to
be relevant. For example, Special Interrogatory No. 26 asks: “State whether
cheating people out of money is normal practice in YOUR family.” (Ex. 3 pdf p.
49.) And Special Interrogatory No. 109 states: “Describe what YOU were wearing
at the New Years Eve Event at the VENUE, including the designer name of all
articles of clothing.” (Ex. 3 pdf p. 93.) Special Interrogatory No. 110 states:
“Describe ANY and All jewelry YOU were wearing at the NEW YEARS EVE EVENT at
the VENUE, including the designer name of all Jewelry.” (Ex. 3 pdf p. 94.) .
Special Interrogatory No. 111 states: “Describe the watch YOU were wearing at
the NEW 1 YEARS EVE EVENT at the VENUE, including the designer name and year
purchased.” (Ex. 3 pdf p. 94.)
This case is
about Defendant’s giving Plaintiff bad checks. (Complaint p. 4.) These are just
a few examples of special interrogatories that this court cannot
see how they are relevant to this action.
However,
Defendant did not argue Defendant’s failure to serve a timely response was due
to mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. And section 2030.290,
subdivision (a) states that “The
court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination
that both of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has
subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240. (2) The party's failure to serve a
timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.”
The
court may relieve a party from its waiver if: “(1) The party has subsequently
served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210,
2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240. [and] (2) The party’s failure to serve a
timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290(a).)¿ 
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.210 states:
 
(a)  
The party to whom interrogatories have
been propounded shall respond in writing under oath separately to each
interrogatory by any of the following:
 
(1)   An
answer containing the information sought to be discovered.
 
(2)   An
exercise of the party's option to produce writings.
 
(3) An objection to the particular
interrogatory.
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.240 states:
 
(a) If only a part of an interrogatory
is objectionable, the remainder of the interrogatory shall be answered.
(b) If an objection is made to an
interrogatory or to a part of an interrogatory, the specific ground for the
objection shall be set forth clearly in the response. If an objection is based
on a claim of privilege, the particular privilege invoked shall be clearly
stated. If an objection is based on a claim that the information sought is
protected work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010), that claim shall be expressly asserted.
Defendant
responded to some of the Special Interrogatories with various boilerplate
objections and/or by stating “this information is also available to Plaintiff
and Plaintiffs counsel who is the wife of Plaintiff.” (Ex. 3 pdf p. 40.)
Defendant provided responsive answers to some of the Special Interrogatories.
(Ex. 3 pdf p. 42.) Defendant also raised the attorney-client privilege and
attorney work product doctrine, but Defendant did not provide any factual
information such that Plaintiff could evaluate the merits of those objections.
(See Ex. 3 pdf p. 43.) As to other Special Interrogatories, Defendant
responded: “Plaintiff, has been paid in full.” (Ex 3. Pdf pp. 95-97.) 
 
Even
if this court found that Defendant’s answers were in substantial compliance
with sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240, Defendant has not
argued Defendant’s failure to serve a timely response was due to mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
 
Thus,
Defendant waived the objections to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories.
 
d.    
Sanctions
 
Plaintiff
seeks $1,460.00 in monetary sanctions against Defendant. (Javaheri Declaration ¶
7.) This includes the $60.00 motion filing fee and four hours of attorneys’
fees for preparing the meet and confer letter and motion and attending the
hearing. (Javaheri Declaration ¶ 7.) 
 
Defendant
did not timely respond to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories. This court finds
Defendant did not act with substantial justification and no other circumstances
makes awarding sanctions unjust. This court also finds that four hours in
attorneys’ fees for preparing the meet and confer letter and motion and
attending the hearing are excessive, given the motion’s simplicity.
 
Thus,
Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions is granted in the reduced amount of
$1,110.00, reflecting the $60.00 motion filing fee, two hours for preparing the
motion and supporting documents, and one hour for appearing at the hearing, at
$350.00 per hour.

Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.)
 
Plaintiff’s
counsel submits a declaration stating they sent Defendant a meet and confer
letter requesting supplemental responses, but Defendant failed to serve any
supplemental responses. (Javaheri Declaration ¶ 5.) Further, even if the motion
to compel responses to Special Interrogatories was subject to the forty-five
day time limit, Plaintiff filed the motion within forty-five days of receiving
Defendant’s responses. (See Javaheri Declaration ¶ 4.)

Legal
Standard
 
“If
a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response .
. . [that party] waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings
under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2030.290.) “The party propounding the interrogatories may move for
an order compelling response to the interrogatories.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290(b).)
“The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its
determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The
party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with
Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240. [and] (2) The party’s
failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or
excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290(a).)¿ 
 
“The
court shall impose a monetary sanction . . . against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290(c).)¿ 
 
c.     
Discussion
 
On
August 7, 2024, Plaintiff served Defendant with Plaintiff’s Form
Interrogatories by mail and email. (Javaheri Declaration ¶ 2; Ex. 1 pdf p. 19.)
On September 7, 2024, Defendant’s “paralegal/mediator” requested an extension
to respond. (Javaheri Declaration ¶ 3.) Plaintiff’s counsel responded: “[t]o
date, Plaintiff has not received responses to the discovery requests sent to
Defendant on August 7, 2024. Please note that Defendants have waived any
objections and must respond. Please be advised that Defendants do not
provide actual responses by Monday September 16, 2024, Plaintiff will be forced
to make a Motion To Compel and Request for Sanctions, including Terminating
Sanctions.” (Javaheri Declaration ¶ 3, bolding in original.) That same day,
Plaintiff’s counsel sent another email “clarifying ‘there is no “extension” to
respond[.]” (Javaheri Declaration ¶ 3.) On September 23, 2024, Plaintiff
received “mostly objection-only responses” from Defendant. (Javaheri
Declaration ¶ 4.) The proof of service stated the responses were sent on
September 16, 2024, but the envelope was postmarked September 19, 2024.
(Javaheri Declaration ¶ 4.)
 
Responses
are due “[w]ithin 30 days after service of interrogatories[.]” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.260.) “In case of service by mail . . . [s]ervice is complete at
the time of the deposit, but any period of notice and any right or duty to do
any act or make any response within any period or on a date certain after
service of the document, which time period or date is prescribed by statute or
rule of court, shall be extended five calendar days . . . if the place of
address and place of mailing is within the State of California[.]” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1013(a).)  Thirty days after
August 7, 2024, plus five calendar days for service by mail, was September 11,
2024. Plaintiff’s counsel told Defendant “there is no ‘extension’ to respond.”
(Javaheri Declaration Ex. 2 p. 1.) Thus, even if Defendant served Plaintiff
with the responses on September 16, 2024, and not when the envelope was
postmarked on September 19, 2024, Defendant’s responses were untimely.
 
The
court may relieve a party from its waiver if: “(1) The party has subsequently
served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210,
2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240. [and] (2) The party’s failure to serve a
timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290(a).)¿ 
 
Even
if this court found that Defendant’s untimely responses were in substantial
compliance with the discovery statutes, section 2030.290 requires both a
substantially compliant response and that the failure to serve the timely
response was due to mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. Defendant has
not argued that Defendant’s failure to serve timely responses was due to
mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.
 
Thus,
Defendant waived the objections to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories.
 
d.    
Sanctions
 
Plaintiff
seeks $1,460.00 in monetary sanctions against Defendant. (Javaheri Declaration ¶
7.) This includes the $60.00 motion filing fee and four hours of attorneys’
fees for preparing the meet and confer letter and motion and attending the
hearing. (Javaheri Declaration ¶ 7.) 
 
Defendant
did not timely respond to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories. This court finds
Defendant did not act with substantial justification and no other circumstances
makes awarding sanctions unjust. This court also finds that four hours in
attorneys’ fees for preparing the meet and confer letter and motion and
attending the hearing are excessive, given the motion’s simplicity. 
 
Thus,
Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions is granted in the reduced amount of
$1,110.00, reflecting the $60.00 motion filing fee, two hours for preparing the
motion and supporting documents, and one hour for appearing at the hearing, at
$350.00 per hour. 
 
V.             
CONCLUSION 
 
For
the foregoing reasons, this court grants Plaintiff’s motions to deem RFAs
admitted, compel responses to Requests for Production, compel responses to
Special Interrogatories, and compel responses to Form Interrogatories. 
 
This
court also grants Plaintiff’s requests for monetary sanctions against Defendant
Saro Dereghishian in the reduced amount of $4,598.51, to be paid within thirty
(30) days’ notice of this court’s order.
