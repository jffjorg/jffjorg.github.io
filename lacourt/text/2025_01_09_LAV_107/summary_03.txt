**Significant Statements**
```
- "The filing of a proof of service declaration ordinarily creates a rebuttable presumption that the service was proper, but only if the service declaration 'complies with the statutory requirements regarding such proofs.'" (Lebel v. Mai (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 1154, 1164.)
- "An individual may be served by substitute service only after a good faith effort at personal service has first been made: the burden is on the plaintiff to show that the summons and complaint 'cannot with reasonable diligence be personally delivered' to the individual defendant." (American Express Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 383, 389.)
```
Summary:
The judge denies the defendants' motion to quash service of summons, finding that the plaintiff has established personal jurisdiction over the defendants by showing that the defendants were served by substituted service and that the plaintiff made a good faith effort to personally serve the defendants before resorting to substituted service. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's declarations of diligence are sufficient to establish service, despite the defendants' objections.
