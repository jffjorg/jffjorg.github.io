  Case Number:  22STCV03568    Hearing Date:   June 27, 2024    Dept:  B   SUPERIOR COURT OF THE  STATE OF CALIFORNIA  FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS  ANGELES - CENTRAL DISTRICT      MARBELLA VILLA,                         Plaintiff(s),             vs.   200 PINE AVENUE, LLC, ET AL.,                         Defendant(s).   ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )    )   Case No.: 22STCV03568 [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: DEMURRER    TO FIRST AMENDED CROSS-COMPLAINT   Dept. 31 1:30 p.m.  June 27, 2024        1. Background             On  January 28, 2022, Plaintiff Marbella Villa (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint  against Defendants 200 Pine Avenue, LLC; Automac Parking, Inc.; and DOES 1 to  50 (“Defendants”), inclusive for: (1) General Negligence and (2) Premises  Liability.              On  March 28, 2024, Cross-Complainant Octopus Restaurant Long Beach, Inc. filed a  First Amended Cross-Complaint (“FAXC”) against Cross-Defendants 200 Pine  Avenue, LLC; Automac Parking, Inc.; Riverrock Real Estate Group Inc.  (“Cross-Defendants”); and ROES 1-20, inclusive for: (1) Express Contractual  Indemnity; (2) Equitable Indemnity and Contribution; (3) Breach of Contract;  and (4) Declaratory Relief.  Cross-Defendants  200 Pine Avenue, LLC (“200 Pine”) and Riverrock Real Estate Group, Inc.  (“Riverrock”), at this time, demur to the FAXC. Cross-Complainant opposes the  demurrer, and 200 Pine and Riverrock filed a reply.    2. Request for Judicial  Notice             200  Pine and Riverrock request judicial notice of the Order of this Court on the  Motion for Summary Adjudication filed by 200 Pine, LLC – Exhibit A.              The  request is granted as to the Order only. Courts cannot take judicial notice of  a judge's findings unless the requirements of res judicata or collateral  estoppel must apply pursuant to a final judgment. (Plumley v. Mockett  (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1031, 1051.) Here, 200 Pine and Riverrock make no such  arguments, thus judicial notice here does not extend to the Court’s findings in  a manner that would accord them preclusive effect in this proceeding.              Cross-Complainant  Octopus Restaurant Long Beach, Inc. (“Octopus”) request judicial notice of  Notice of Ruling on 200 Pine’s Demurrer to Cross-Complaint by Octopus – Exhibit  1.  The request is  granted as to the Ruling only. Courts cannot take judicial notice of a judge's  findings unless the requirements of res judicata or collateral estoppel must  apply pursuant to a final judgment. (Plumley v. Mockett (2008) 164  Cal.App.4th 1031, 1051.) Here, Octopus make no such arguments, thus judicial  notice here does not extend to the Court’s findings in a manner that would  accord them preclusive effect in this proceeding.    3. Demurrer to FAXC a. Meet and Confer Prior to filing a  demurrer, the demurring party is required to meet and confer with the party who  filed the pleading that is subject to the demurrer for the purposes of  determining whether an agreement can be reached through a filing of an amended  pleading that would resolve the objections to be raised in the motion to  strike. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41.)  The Court finds that  200 Pine and Riverrock have fulfilled this requirement prior to filing the  instant demurrer. (See Smith Decl., ¶3, Ex. B.)   b. Legal Standard “The primary  function of a pleading is to give the other party notice so that it may prepare  its case [citation], and a defect in a pleading that otherwise properly  notifies a party cannot be said to affect substantial rights.” (Harris v.  City of Santa Monica (2013) 56 Cal.4th 203, 240.)             “A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the factual  allegations in a complaint.” (Ivanoff v. Bank of America, N.A.(2017) 9  Cal.App.5th 719, 725.) The Court looks to whether “the complaint alleges facts  sufficient to state a cause of action or discloses a complete defense.” (Id.)  The Court does not “read passages from a complaint in isolation; in reviewing a  ruling on a demurrer, we read the complaint ‘as a whole and its parts in their  context.’ [Citation.]” (West v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214  Cal.App.4th 780, 804.) The Court “assume[s] the truth of the properly pleaded  factual allegations, facts that reasonably can be inferred from those expressly  pleaded and matters of which judicial notice has been taken.” (Harris, supra,  56 Cal.4th p. 240.) “The court does not, however, assume the truth of  contentions, deductions or conclusions of law. [Citation.]” (Durell v. Sharp  Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.) A general demurrer  may be brought under Code of Civil Procedure Section 430.10, subdivision (e) if  insufficient facts are stated to support the cause of action asserted or under  section 430.10, subdivision (a), where the court has no jurisdiction of the subject  of the cause of action alleged in the pleading. All other grounds listed in  Section 430.10, including uncertainty under subdivision (f), are special  demurrers. Special demurrers are not allowed in limited jurisdiction courts.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 92, subd. (c).)             Leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable  possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18  Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a  pleading can be amended successfully. (Id.)    c. Discussion             First  Cause of Action for Express Contractual Indemnity 200 Pine and  Riverrock contend the Restaurant Lease (“Lease”) only runs in favor of the  Landlord Parties within the context of this case, not Octopus. As such, 200  Pine and Riverrock demur on the ground that the gross negligence and willful  misconduct exception to Octopus’s indemnity obligation does not apply because  (1) Plaintiff has not alleged gross negligence or willful misconduct and (2) Octopus  is otherwise required by the Lease to carry insurance to cover such claims and  have the Landlord named as an additional insured.  “Express indemnity  refers to an obligation that arises ‘by virtue of express contractual language  establishing a duty in one party to save another harmless upon the occurrence  of specified circumstances’ and ‘is enforced in accordance with the terms of the  contracting parties’ agreement.’” (C.W. Howe Partners Inc. v. Mooradian  (2019) 43 Cal.App.5th 688, 699.) “An indemnitee seeking to recover on an  agreement for indemnification must allege the parties’ contractual  relationship, the indemnitee's performance of that portion of the contract,  which gives rise to the indemnification claim, the facts showing a loss within  the meaning of the parties’ indemnification agreement, and the amount of  damages sustained.” (Id. at 699-700.) “‘Gross  negligence’ long has been defined in California and other jurisdictions as  either a ‘want of even scant care’ or ‘an extreme departure from the ordinary  standard of conduct.’” (City of Santa Barbara v. Superior Court (2007)  41 Cal.4th 747, 754.) “[W]illful  misconduct is not marked by a mere absence of care. Rather, it involves a more  positive intent actually to harm another or to do an act with a positive,  active and absolute disregard of its consequences.” (Manuel v. Pacific Gas  & Electric Co. (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 927, 940 [internal quotations  omitted].) The FAXC  alleges: “5. OCTOPUS  RESTAURANT LONG BEACH, INC. assumed a contract to lease the premises specified  in the contract with 200 PINE A VENUE, LLC (the “Lease”)....” “6. Under the  terms of the Lease, the garage and hallway are not OCTOPUS RESTAURANT LONG  BEACH, INC.'s responsibility and the owner, 200 PINE AVENUE, LLC, had  maintenance obligations for the common areas.” “8. The Lease also  states: 10.1.1 Landlord. and its partners and subpartners, and their  respective officers, agents, property managers, servants. employees. and  independent contractors (collectively “Landlord Parties") shall not  be liable and Tenant hereby, waives all claims against them for any damage to  any property or any injury to any person in or about the Premises  (including the Patio Area. Trash Enclosure Area and Storage Area), the  Building or the Real Property by or from any cause whatsoever (including  without limiting the foregoing, rain or water leakage of any character from the  roof, windows, walls, basement, pipes, plumbing works or appliances, the  Building or Real Property not being in good condition or repair, gas, fire,  oil, electricity or theft), except to the extent caused by or arising from  the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord or its agents, employees  or contractors.…” “9. The Lease also  excludes certain claims from Section 10.1.1 stating: 10.1.2  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10.1.1 above to the contrary, the  assumption of risk and release by Tenant set forth above, and Tenant’s  indemnity of Landlord set forth above, shall not apply to: (i) any  Claims to the extent resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct  of Landlord or any of the Landlord Parties and not insured or required to be  insured by Tenant under this Lease (collectively, the “Excluded Claims”), …  . In addition, Landlord shall indemnify, defend, protect and hold Tenant  Harmless from all such Excluded Claims, except for (a) any loss or damage to  Tenant’s property to the extent Tenant has waive such loss or damage pursuant  to Section 10.4 below, and (b) any lost profits, loss of business or other consequential  damages.” “10. Any plumbing  failure which allegedly caused or contributed to Plaintiffs injuries occurred  well outside the four walls of the Premises and 200 Pine and/or RiverRock had a  duty to repair and maintain the basic plumbing and sewage lines at issue.” “12. On  information and belief, Automac, RiverRock, 200 Pine, and Roes 1-20 knew of the  water pooling on the floor of the parking garage prior to the date Plaintiff  alleges she was injured.” “13. On  information and belief, Automac, RiverRock, 200 Pine, and Roes 1-20 acted with  gross negligence and/or willful misconduct of their duties under the Lease when  they chose not to investigate and remedy the cause of the water pooling on the  floor of the parking garage despite their knowledge of the issue.” “15. Pursuant to  Section 10.1.2 of the Lease, 200 Pine is contractually required to indemnify,  defend, protect and hold Tenant Harmless from Excluded Claims, as defined in  the Lease.” “17. By reason of  the gross negligence and/or willful actions or inaction of 200 Pine,  Cross-Complainant is entitled to express indemnification from 200 Pine.” Here, the FAXC does  not state sufficient facts to support the express contractual indemnity cause  of action. As shown above, the FAXC alleges that Octopus, 200 Pine, and  Riverrock had a contractual relationship via the Lease. The FAXC further  alleges that 200 Pine and Riverrock were responsible for maintenance of the  common areas, specifically the plumbing and sewage that purportedly contributed  to Plaintiff’s injuries. The FAXC also alleges that 200 Pine and Riverrock knew  of the water pooling on the floor of the parking garage prior to the date  Plaintiff claims she was injured and failed to investigate and remedy the cause  of the water pooling as required under the Lease, which if accepted as true can  reasonably be inferred as constituting facts to support gross negligence or  willful misconduct despite 200 Pine and Riverrock’s contrary assertions.  However, the FAXC does not allege Plaintiff’s claims were not insured or  required to be insured by Octopus demonstrating that Octopus is entitled to  indemnification under the Lease.  Therefore, the  demurrer is SUSTAINED with Leave to Amend as to the first cause of action.               Second Cause of  Action for Equitable Indemnity and Contribution 200 Pine and  Riverrock contend given the express indemnity paragraph of the Lease, there is  no legal basis to claim equitable indemnity. (Rossmoor Sanitation, Inc. v.  Pylon, Inc. (1975) 13 Cal.3d 622, 628; see also, Regional Steel Corp. v.  Superior Court (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 525, 528- 529.) “The elements of a  cause of action for [equitable] indemnity are (1) a showing of fault on the  part of the indemnitor and (2) resulting damages to the indemnitee for which  the indemnitor is ... equitably responsible.” (C.W. Howe Partners Inc. v.  Mooradian (2019) 43 Cal.App.5th 688, 700.) The FAXC  alleges: “19. If the  Plaintiff sustained injuries, it was a direct result of the negligence of Cross-Defendants,  and each of them.” “20. In the event  the Cross-Complainant is held liable to the Plaintiff in the principal action,  that such liability arises only by reason of the active and primary negligence  of Cross-Defendants, and each of them, and through no fault of  Cross-Complainant whose fault, if any, is secondary and passive only.” “21. The  Plaintiffs damages, if any, were caused by the negligence, carelessness, gross  negligence and willful misconduct of the Cross-Defendants, and each of them,  and as such under the rules of comparative negligence, Cross-Complainant is  entitled to equitable indemnity and equitable contribution for the amount of  negligence attributable to Cross-Defendants, and each of them.” “22. By reason of  these premises, Cross-Complainant is entitled to equitable indemnification and  equitable contribution from said Cross-Defendants, and each of them.” Here, the FAXC state  facts sufficient to support the equitable indemnity and contribution cause of  action. The FAXC alleges 200 Pine and Riverrock are at fault for the  injuries sustained by Plaintiff. The FAXC  further alleges to the extent that Octopus is at fault, it is secondary to 200  Pine and Riverrock’s gross negligence and misconduct. Moreover, the cases cited  by 200 Pine and Riverrock are inapposite because they did not concern issue of  equitable versus express indemnity during the pleading stage but rather on a  motion for summary judgment and final judgment.  Therefore, the  demurrer is OVERRULED as to the second cause of action.               Third Cause of  Action for Breach of Contract 200 Pine and  Riverrock contend there is no legal basis for a breach of contract cause of  action because the rights and obligations of the parties in response to a  personal injury claim are exclusively governed by the express indemnity  paragraph.  “Establishing that  claim requires a showing of “(1) the existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff's  performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant's breach, and (4) the  resulting damages to the plaintiff.” (D’Arrigo Bros. of California v. United  Farmworkers of America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 790, 800.) “Further, the  complaint must indicate on its face whether the contract is written, oral, or  implied by conduct.” (Otworth v. Southern Pac. Transportation Co. (1985)  166 Cal.App.3d 452, 458–459.) The FAXC  alleges: “24. 200 Pine and  Roes 1-10 breached their contract with Cross-complainant by failing to maintain  the “surface parking facility and the building parking structure ... and other  improvements surrounding the Building" which are common areas and failing  to repair and maintain the structural portions of the Building, including the  basic plumbing, sewage.” “25. As a result  of 200 Pine and Roes 1-10 's breaches, they have caused damage to  Cross-complainant and are responsible for Plaintiffs alleged injuries, if  anyone is.” Here, the FAXC does  not state facts sufficient to support the breach of contract cause of action. The  FAXC alleges that Octopus, 200 Pine, and Riverrock entered into a valid written  Lease, which is incorporated by reference. The FAXC further alleges 200 Pine  and Riverrock were responsible for maintenance of the all common areas under  Lease. The FAXC further alleges 200 Pine and Riverrock breached the Lease by  failing to maintain and repair the water pooling that occurred in the parking  garage. As discussed above, it can be reasonably inferred from the FAXC  allegations that 200 Pine and Riverrock’s failed to maintain and repair/remedy  the water pooling issue if taken as true, 200 Pine and Riverrock’s action  demonstrates gross negligence and/or willful misconduct. The FAXC also alleges  200 Pine and Riverrock’s breach has resulted in damages to Octopus. As  previously discussed, however, the FAXC does not allege Plaintiff’s claims were  not insured or required to be insured by Octopus demonstrating that Octopus is  entitled to indemnification under the Lease.  Therefore, the  demurrer is SUSTAINED with Leave to Amend as to the third cause of action.    Fourth Cause of  Action for Declaratory Relief 200 Pine and  Riverrock contend seeking an order that 200 Pine defend Cross-Complainant is  contrary to Civil Code section 2778, Crawford v. Weather Shield Mfg., Inc.  (2008) 44 Cal.4th 541 and its progeny, and contrary to the court’s prior order  granting the Motion for Summary Adjudication by 200 Pine. “To qualify for  declaratory relief under section 1060,13 plaintiffs were required to show their  action (as refined on appeal) presented two essential elements: ‘(1) a proper  subject of declaratory relief, and (2) an actual controversy involving  justiciable questions relating to the rights or obligations of a party.’” (Lee  v. Silveira (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 527, 546.) The FAXC  alleges: “28. An actual  controversy has arisen among Cross-Complainant and 200 Pine concerning the  respective rights, obligations, and duties of said Cross-Complainant and 200  Pine with respect to Plaintiffs claims in this action under the terms of the  Lease between Cross-Complainant and 200 Pine. Cross-Complainant contends that,  independent of any obligations of 200 Pine to indemnify Cross-Complainant, 200  Pine is required to defend Cross-Complainant against Plaintiff's claims in this  action.” “29.  Cross-Complainant has tendered its defense to 200 Pine pursuant to the contract  terms and pursuant to the case Crawford v. Weather Shield (2008) 44 Cal.  4th 541 and California Code Civil Procedure Section 2778.” “30. 200 Pine has  not agreed to defend. Cross-Complainant hereby tenders its defense of  Plaintiff's claims, again, to 200 Pine. Cross-Complainant is informed and  believes and thereon alleges that 200 Pine refuses to accept such tender.” Here, the FAXC does  not state facts sufficient to support the claim for declaratory relief. As  explained above, the FAXC alleges facts that if taken as true reasonably infer  that 200 Pine and Riverrock’s action in failing to maintain and repair/remedy  the water pooling issue despite knowledge of it before the incident giving rise  to Plaintiff’s claim constitutes gross negligence and/or willful misconduct.  The FAXC further alleges that claims caused by gross negligence and/or willful  misconduct of 200 Pine and Riverrock are subject to indemnification.  Nevertheless, the FAXC does not allege Plaintiff’s claims were not insured or  required to be insured by Octopus demonstrating that Octopus is entitled to  indemnification under the Lease. Therefore, the  demurrer is SUSTAINED with Leave to Amend as to the fourth cause of action.    Moving Cross-Defendants  are ordered to give notice.       Dated this 27th day of June,  2024                      Hon. Karen    Moskowitz Judge    of the Superior Court
