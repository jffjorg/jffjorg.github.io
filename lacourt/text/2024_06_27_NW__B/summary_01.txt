And here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling deals with a demurrer to a First Amended Cross-Complaint (FAXC) filed by Cross-Complainant Octopus Restaurant Long Beach, Inc. against Cross-Defendants 200 Pine Avenue, LLC, et al. The FAXC alleges that the defendants are liable for the plaintiff's injuries due to gross negligence and/or willful misconduct. The defendants demurred, arguing that the FAXC does not state sufficient facts to support the causes of action. The court finds that the FAXC does not state sufficient facts to support the first cause of action for express contractual indemnity, the third cause of action for breach of contract, and the fourth cause of action for declaratory relief. However, the court finds that the FAXC states sufficient facts to support the second cause of action for equitable indemnity and contribution. The court orders that the demurrer be sustained with leave to amend as to the first, third, and fourth causes of action, and overruled as to the second cause of action.
