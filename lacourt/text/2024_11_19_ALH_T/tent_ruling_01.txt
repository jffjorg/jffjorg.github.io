  Case Number:  23STCV28339    Hearing Date:   November 19, 2024    Dept:  T Motions to Compel DiscoveryCase Name: Aurora Becerra v. Family Dollar Inc.Moving Party: Defendant Alpha Beta Company dba Food 4 LessResponding Party: N/ATentative Ruling: GRANTBACKGROUNDThis is a personal injury case arising from a May 5, 2022 incident wherein Plaintiff Aurora Becerra (“Plaintiff”) alleges items fell onto her foot while she was shopping. Defendant served its first set of Form and Special Interrogatories on Plaintiff on April 10, 2024. (Motion to Compel Special Interrogatories, p. 10; Exh. A.) Defendant provided an extension until June 21 after receiving no responses by June 7, 2024. (Id. at 21, Exh. B.) Defendant then sent a meet and confer email to Plaintiff after again receiving no response. Plaintiff replied stating the responses were being prepared; in a July 3, 2024, Plaintiff assured that responses would be provided by the end of the day. (Id. at 23-29, Exh. B, C.) Defendant additionally served Plaintiff with its Request for Document Production on April 10, 2024, and has yet to receive a response despite Defendant providing several extensions. To date, Defendant has yet to receive responses to these discovery requests. (Motion to Compel Production, p. 7.)MOVING PARTY POSITIONDefendant argues the Court should grant its motions because Plaintiff’s failures to provide responses is preventing Defendant from obtaining legitimate and essential discovery and warrants the Court’s intervention. Defendant also seeks monetary sanctions against Plaintiff. Defendant requests $735 for the Requests for Production motion, including a $60 filing fee and 1.50 hours preparing the motion, in addition to anticipated 0.75 hours replying to any opposition, 0.75 hours preparing for the hearing. And 0.75 hours to attend it. Defendant’s counsel charges a rate of $225 per hour. (Motion to Compel Production, p. 8.)Additionally, Defendant requests $225 in sanctions for the costs arising from motion to compel arising from Plaintiff’s failure to respond to Form Interrogatories as well as to Special Interrogatories – asserting costs of a $60 filing fee and 1.00 hour of attorney time preparing the motion for each motion.  (Motion to Compel Form Interrogatories, p. 8; Motion to Compel Special Interrogatories, p. 8.) Defendant’s motions seek $285.00 each, but the Court must defer to the number requested in Defendant’s notice – here $225.00.OPPOSITIONNo opposition has been filed to this motion.ANALYSISI.  Motion to Compel DiscoveryCode of Civil Procedure sec. 2031.010 allows a party to propound a written request for document production, to be answered under oath. This discovery may be served by a defendant at any time, without leave of court. (Sec. 2031.020(a).) Written responses to the document production request must also include a statement asserting that the party will comply, that the party cannot comply, or alternatively objecting to the request. (Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.210(a).) Responsive documents shall be produced on the date specified in the demand, or other date agreed by the parties. (Section 2031.280(d).) The party propounding the requests for production may extend the time in which responses are provided, confirmed in writing. (Section 2031.270.) A responding party’s failure to serve a timely response will waive any objection to the demand. (Section 2031.300(a). If a party fails to respond to a document production request, the requesting party may move for an order compelling a response. (Code of Civil Procedure Sec. 2031.310(b).) Written responses to form interrogatories must be made under oath. (Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.210(a), 2030.250(a).) The response must be served within thirty days after the interrogatories are served on the responding party. (Section 2030.260(a).) A party propounding interrogatories may extend the time during which responses can be provided. (Section 2030.270.) If the responding party fails to serve a timely response, that party waives any objection to the interrogatories. (Section 2030.290(a).) If a party fails to respond to a form interrogatories, the party serving the discovery may move for an order compelling a response. (Code of Civil Procedure Sec. 2030.300(a).) The court shall also impose monetary sanctions any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully opposes a motion to compel a response, unless it the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.In this case, granting Defendant’s motions to compel is appropriate. Despite receiving extensions and reminders from Defendant, Plaintiff has failed to provide responses to any of Defendant’s discovery – including the Request for Production, Form Interrogatories, and Special Interrogatories that are the subject of the instant motions. Plaintiff’s failure to provide responses to any of Defendant’s propounded discovery requests, in turn, prevents Defendant from conducting discovery it is entitled to. It is therefore appropriate for the Court to intervene by granting each of Defendant’s motions to compel, requiring Plaintiff to provide responses to Defendant’s yet unanswered Request for Production, Form Interrogatories, and Special Interrogatories.lII. SanctionsDefendant requests sanctions in the amount of $1,185.00 in total for the reasonable costs incurred bringing the three instant motions. Defendant requests sanctions in the amount of $735.00 for the motion to compel production, $225.00 for the motion to compel responses to Form Interrogatories, and $225.00 for the motion to compel responses to Special Interrogatories. The Court finds Defendant’s $225.00 hourly rate is reasonable, and considers sanctions for each motion in turn. The Court discounts the requested number of hours for the motion to compel production by 1 given that no opposition was filed.  RULINGBased on the foregoing, the Court rules as follows:Defendant’s motion to compel responses to Special Interrogatories is GRANTED. Defendant’s request for sanctions pertaining to the motion is GRANTED in the amount of $225.00. Defendant’s motion to compel responses to Form Interrogatories is GRANTED. Defendant’s request for sanctions pertaining to the motion is GRANTED in the amount of $225.00. Defendant’s motion to compel production is GRANTED. Defendant’s request for sanctions pertaining to the motion is GRANTED in the amount of $675.
