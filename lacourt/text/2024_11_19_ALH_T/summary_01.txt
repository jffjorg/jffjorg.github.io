The judge finds that the plaintiff's failure to respond is preventing the defendant from obtaining legitimate and essential discovery and warrants the court's intervention. The judge has also granted the defendant's request for sanctions in the amount of $1,185, which includes $735 for the motion to compel production and $225 for each of the other two motions.
