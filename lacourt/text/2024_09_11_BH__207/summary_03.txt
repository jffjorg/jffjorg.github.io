And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Michael E. Whitaker, has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant Chino Standard, Inc.'s motion to vacate the award of $760 in mandatory sanctions. The sanctions were awarded due to the Defendant's failure to timely serve responses to requests for admission, which necessitated the motion. The Judge found that the failure to serve timely responses was not due to excusable neglect, and that the mandatory sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280 were properly imposed. The Judge also noted that the six-month limit for seeking relief under section 473 is mandatory, and that the Defendant's motion was not made within that time frame.
