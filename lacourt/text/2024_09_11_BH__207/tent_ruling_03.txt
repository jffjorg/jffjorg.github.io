Motion to Vacate Sanctions

MOTION
 
On April 11, 2024, the Court issued a Minute Order, denying as moot
Plaintiff’s request to deem admitted the matters in the requests for admission
served on Defendant Chino Standard, Inc. (“Defendant”), on the grounds that
responses were served two days before the hearing, but awarding $760 in mandatory
sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (c) because
the failure to timely serve responses necessitated Plaintiff’s motion.  
 
Defendant now moves to vacate the award of sanctions on the grounds
that Defendant’s failure to timely provide responses to the RFA was the result
of trial counsel’s and the handling attorney’s abrupt departures from the law
firm at the time the responses were due, including because of the handling
attorney’s diagnosis with Stage 4 Cancer.
 
Plaintiff opposes the motion.
 
ANALYSIS
 
I.               
MOTION TO VACATE
 
Code of Civil procedure section 473 “includes a discretionary
provision, which applies permissively, and a mandatory provision, which applies
as of right.” (Minick v. City of Petaluma (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 15, 25
(hereafter Minick).)  “Section 473
is a remedial statute to be “applied liberally” in favor of relief if the
opposing party will not suffer prejudice. 
Because the law strongly favors trial and disposition on the merits, any
doubts in applying section 473 must be resolved in favor of the party seeking
relief from default.  Unless inexcusable
neglect is clear, the policy favoring trial on the merits prevails.”  (Minick, supra, 3 Cal.App.5th at p. 24
[cleaned up].)  
 
The party or the legal
representative must seek such relief “within a reasonable time, in no case
exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was
taken.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); see Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 980 [“because more than
six months had elapsed from the entry of default, and hence relief under
section 473 was unavailable”]; People v.
The North River Ins. Co. (2011) 200 Ca.App.4th 712, 721 [motion
for relief under section 473 must be brought “within a reasonable time, in no
case exceeding six months”]).  “The
six-month limit is mandatory; a court has no authority to grant relief under
section 473, subdivision (b), unless an application is made within the
six-month period.”  (Arambula v. Union Carbide Corp. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 333, 340,
citations omitted.)  
 
A.   
Discretionary
Relief
 
Per Code of Civil Procedure
section 473, subdivision (b), a court may “relieve a party or his or her legal
representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken
against him or her through his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” 
 
B.   
Mandatory
Relief
 
Notwithstanding any other requirements of this
section, the court shall, whenever an application for relief is made no more
than six months after entry of judgment, is in proper form, and is accompanied
by an attorney's sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, vacate any
(1) resulting default entered by the clerk against his or her client, and which
will result in entry of a default judgment, or (2) resulting default judgment
or dismissal entered against his or her client, unless the
court finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the
attorney's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).)  “In considering whether the trial court
properly denied relief under section 473(b), the first question is the
sufficiency of defendants' showing of attorney fault, if believed, to trigger
the mandatory relief provisions of that statute.”  (Standard Microsystems Corp. v. Winbond
Electronics Corp. (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 868, 896, disapproved on other
grounds by Even Zohar Construction & Remodeling, Inc. v. Bellaire
Townhouses, LLC (2015) 61 Cal.4th 830 (hereafter Standard).)  “Under section 473(b), a party is entitled to
relief from a default and resulting judgment whenever, on timely application
for relief, his attorney ‘attest[s] to his or her mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or neglect’ in connection with the default or the judgment.”  (Ibid.)  
 
            Here, the Court awarded mandatory sanctions
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (c), which
provides, “It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both,
whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated
this motion.”
            
            Section 2033.280 does not provide this
Court with any discretion.  If the
failure to serve a timely response necessitates the motion, as occurred here, monetary
sanctions are mandatory.  Therefore, the
Court cannot vacate the sanctions order on the basis of counsel’s mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, as it would improperly circumvent the
legislative mandate under Section 2033.280.
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
            Therefore, the Court denies Defendant’s
motion to vacate sanctions.  
 
            Defendant shall provide notice of
the Court’s ruling and file the notice with a proof of service.
