MOTIONS
 
            Plaintiff SM 10000 Property LLC
(“Plaintiff”) moves to compel responses from Defendant Tyrina Lee (“Defendant”)
to Special Interrogatories (Set One) (“SROG”) and Demands for Production of
Documents (Set One) (“RPD”).  Defendant
also seeks monetary sanctions in connection with the motions.  
 
Plaintiff’s motions are unopposed.
 
LEGAL
STANDARDS
 
1.     Special
Interrogatories
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290,
“[i]f a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely
response . . . [t]he party to whom the interrogatories are directed waives any
right to exercise the option to produce writings under Section 2030.230, as
well as any objection to the interrogatories, including one based on privilege
or the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010.  . . .   [and] The party propounding the
interrogatories may move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subds. (a)-(b).) 
 
2.     Requests
for Production
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300, subdivision (a),
“[i]f a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
directed fails to serve a timely response . . . [t]he party to whom the demand
for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection
to the demand, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work
product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010.  . . . [and] The party making the demand may
move for an order compelling response to the demand.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subds. (a)-(b).)  
 
ANALYSIS
 
1.    
Discovery Requests
 
Plaintiff served Defendant the SROG and RPD electronically
and by mail on April 1, 2024.  (See Exhibit
1 Declaration of Service.)  As of the filing date of the motions, Plaintiff
has not received responses from Defendant. 
Accordingly, the Court finds that Defendant has failed to serve timely
responses to the SROG and RPD.  (Ishu Decl. ¶ 5.)  
 
2.    
Monetary Sanctions
Plaintiff
requests monetary sanctions for legal fees expended in connection with the
motions.  The Court finds Defendant’s
failure to timely respond to the SROG and RPD to be an abuse of the discovery
process, warranting monetary sanctions. 
(See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.010, subd. (d), 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300,
subd. (c).)  Accordingly, the Court will impose
monetary sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $1,100, which represents
four hours of attorney time to prepare the motions and attend the hearing, at
$275 per hour.   
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court grants Plaintiff’s motions to compel responses to
the SROG and RPD per Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300.  As such, the Court orders Defendant to serve
verified responses to the SROG and RPD, without objections, within 30 days of
notice of the Court’s orders.
   
Further, the Court orders Defendant to pay monetary sanctions in the
amount of $1,100, by and through counsel for Plaintiff, within 30 days of
notice of the Court’s orders.
 
Plaintiff is ordered to
provide notice of the Court’s orders and file the notice with a proof of
service forthwith.
