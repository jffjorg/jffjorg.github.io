The plaintiff has filed a motion to quash a subpoena issued by the defendant, Long Beach Unified School District (LBUSD), which seeks to discover the plaintiff's sexual conduct with individuals other than the alleged perpetrator. The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion, finding that LBUSD failed to comply with the mandatory procedures set forth in Code of Civil Procedure § 2017.220 before serving the subpoena. The judge also notes that the information requested in the subpoena appears overly broad and that any future discovery requests should be more narrowly tailored to the issues in the case.
