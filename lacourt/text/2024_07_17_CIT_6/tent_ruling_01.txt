  Case Number:  24PSCV00591    Hearing Date:   July 17, 2024    Dept:  6 Plaintiff
Tawa, Inc. (Retail)’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment 
Defendant: Liming Luo 
TENTATIVE RULING 
            Plaintiff’s
request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.           
BACKGROUND           
            This
is a commercial lease dispute. On February 26, 2024, plaintiff Tawa, Inc.
(Retail)[1] (Plaintiff) filed this action
against defendant Liming Luo (Defendant) and Does 1 to 10, alleging causes of
action for breach of contract – lease agreement, account stated, and book
account. Default was entered against Defendant on June 4, 2024. Plaintiff
requested entry of default judgment on June 13, 2024.           
LEGAL
STANDARD 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party
has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party
seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court
Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other
admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest
computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration
of nonmilitary status; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all
parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate
judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for
attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.) 
ANALYSIS 
Plaintiff
seeks default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $49,960.37, including
$41,948.32 in damages, $5,838.29 in interest, $1,648.45 in attorney fees, and $525.31
in costs. The Court finds Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment has
some issues. First, Form CIV-100 incorrectly indicated that it was requesting a
clerk’s judgment, to which the clerk’s office sent a notice of rejection on
June 25, 2024. (Notice of Rejection Default/Clerk’s Judgment (6/25/24).) Plaintiff
should instead complete paragraph 1, subdivision (d), on Form CIV-100. Second,
the amount stated in paragraph 2, subdivision (a), of Form CIV-100 does not
match the amount stated in Exhibit 4. (Form CIV-100, ¶ 2, subd. (2)(a);
Plaintiff’s Exhibits in Support of Request for Entry of Default Judgment, Ex.
4.) Third, Plaintiff did not provide a proposed judgment per Rule 3.1800,
subdivision (a)(6), of the California Rules of Court. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1800, subd. (a)(6).) 
CONCLUSION           
            Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s
request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
