And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment. The plaintiff, Tawa, Inc. (Retail), is seeking a default judgment against the defendant, Liming Luo, in the amount of $49,960.37. The judge has denied the request without prejudice due to several issues with the plaintiff's request. Specifically, the judge noted that the plaintiff's Form CIV-100 incorrectly indicated that it was requesting a clerk's judgment, which was rejected by the clerk's office. Additionally, the amount stated in the form did not match the amount stated in an exhibit, and the plaintiff did not provide a proposed judgment as required by the California Rules of Court. The judge has given the plaintiff an opportunity to correct these issues and resubmit its request for entry of default judgment.
