And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's first amended complaint seeking punitive damages. The plaintiff, Stephanie Armstrong, alleged that the defendants, Beach Front Property Management, Inc. and 745-747 Venice Way, failed to maintain the property, leading to vermin infestations, plumbing issues, and other problems. The plaintiff also alleged that the defendants' employees knew of the poor living conditions and failed to fix them, but the judge found that the plaintiff's allegations were conclusory and lacked sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages. The judge also found that the plaintiff's allegations of retaliation, harassment, and racial discrimination were vague and lacked supporting facts. The judge granted the defendants' motion to strike, but allowed the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint to cure the defects.
