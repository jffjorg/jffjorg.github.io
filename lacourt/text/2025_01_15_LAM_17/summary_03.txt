And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling by Judge Hon. Jon R. Takasugi sustains in part and overrules in part the demurrer filed by defendant Ironmark. The demurrer is overruled as to all causes of action except the fifth cause of action, which is sustained with 10 days' leave to amend. The court finds that the fourth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth causes of action are sufficiently pled, but the fifth cause of action lacks specific allegations. The court orders that Plaintiff may add back general allegations related to "Beniga's and Ironmark's Wrongdoing" if the deletion of these allegations was in error. The ruling is subject to change based on any submissions made by the parties.
