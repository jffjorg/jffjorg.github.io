And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to have her Requests for Admission (RFAs) deemed admitted as to the plaintiff. The plaintiff, who is representing herself, has failed to respond to the RFAs and has not opposed the motion. As a result, the court has taken the plaintiff's non-opposition as a concession to the motion and has granted it. Additionally, the court has sanctioned the plaintiff $700.00 for her failure to respond to the RFAs. The court has ordered that the plaintiff's failure to respond to the RFAs is a concession to the motion on the merits, and that sanctions are mandatory due to the lack of substantial justification for the plaintiff's failure to respond.
