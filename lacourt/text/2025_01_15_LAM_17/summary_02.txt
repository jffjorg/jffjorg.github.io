Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant LX Hausys to produce its custodian of record is moot. This is because new counsel for LX Hausys has recently substituted into the case and has been working with the plaintiff's counsel to arrange for the production of LX Hausys' corporate representative for deposition. The judge finds that LX Hausys' conduct is justified and therefore declines to award sanctions. The motion is therefore denied.
