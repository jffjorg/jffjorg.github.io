  vs.
 
JACQUELINE SAULS, et al. 
  


 Case
  No.:  24STCV12255    
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  January 15, 2025




 
Defendant’s
motion to have her RFAs deemed admitted is GRANTED. Plaintiff, who is
representing herself pro per, is sanctioned $700.00.
 
On 5/15/2024,
Plaintiff Olivia Dizon (Plaintiff) filed suit against Jacqueline Sauls,
Frederick Sauls, and Karoline Sauls, alleging: (1) failure to pay wages; (2)
waiting time wage continuation; (3) failure to provide accurate itemized wage
statements; (4) failure to indemnify and reimburse in violation of Labor Code
section 2802; and (5) unfair business practices. 
 
On 12/6/2024,
Defendant Jacqueline Sauls (Defendant) moved to have her Requests for Admission
(RFAs) deemed admitted as to Plaintiff.
 
The motion is
unopposed.
 
Discussion 
 
            Defendant
served Plaintiff with RFAs on 10/16/2024. To date, no responses have been received,
and Plaintiff did not oppose this motion. 
 
            The
Court takes Plaintiff’s non-opposition as a concession to the motion on the
merits. Given the lack of substantial justification for Plaintiff’s failure to
respond, sanctions are mandatory. 
 
            Based
on the foregoing, Defendant’s motion to have her RFAs deemed admitted is
granted. Plaintiff, who is representing herself pro per, is sanctioned $700.00.
($350/hr x 2.) 
 
            It
is so ordered.
