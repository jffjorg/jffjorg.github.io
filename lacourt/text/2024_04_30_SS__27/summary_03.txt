And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Plaintiff's Counsel Armin Abazari's motion to be relieved as counsel, citing an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. Abazari filed the motion, which was unopposed, and had served the necessary forms on the client and other parties. However, the court notes that withdrawing counsel at this time would be prejudicial or disrupt the orderly process of justice, particularly given the upcoming deposition hearing scheduled for May 1, 2024. The court also expresses doubt about whether the Plaintiff has been properly served with the motion. The judge's tentative ruling will be reconsidered if all parties submit their objections in writing by email or appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
