The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's motion to continue the trial scheduled for May 7, 2024. The Plaintiff filed the motion on April 10, 2024, but failed to provide sufficient notice to the Defendant, as required by law. The Defendant filed an opposition arguing that the motion did not meet the 18 court days' notice period. The Judge agrees with the Defendant's argument and denies the motion. The Judge notes that the earliest date to hear a motion filed on April 10, 2024, would be May 6, 2024, and that the Plaintiff did not provide an explanation for failing to meet the required notice period.
