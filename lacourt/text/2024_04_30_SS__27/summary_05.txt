```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to strike punitive damages against Defendant Llorens. The judge finds that the allegations in the complaint are insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. The judge notes that punitive damages require a showing of "malice," which entails despicable conduct carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others. The judge concludes that the allegations in the complaint do not meet the level of willfulness required for malice. The judge also notes that the complaint merely alleges that Defendant Llorens allowed co-defendant Avila, who was intoxicated, to drive his car, but this alone is not sufficient to demonstrate malice. The judge grants the motion to strike without leave to amend as to Defendant Llorens.
