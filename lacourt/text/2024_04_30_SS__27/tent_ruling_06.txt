Background
 
On October 21, 2022,
Plaintiff Eric Canton allegedly tripped and fell on an unsecured metal grate
near the intersection of 6th Street and St. Andrew Place. On December 9, 2022,
the Plaintiff filed a claim with the City of Los Angeles (“City”) under the
Government Claims Act, specifying that the incident occurred at the
intersection of 6th Street and St. Andrew Place. The City rejected the claim
because Plaintiff failed to provide a specific address in the claim form to
pinpoint exactly where the incident occurred. Defendant City now moves the
court for judgment on the pleadings on the basis that Plaintiff’s claim filed
on December 9, 2022, did not substantially comply with the requirements under
the Government Tort Claims Act.
Government Tort Claims Act
The requirements of the Government Tort Claims
Act under Gov Code Section 910 require the Plaintiff to present a government
claim on the public entity prior to filing suit apply to tort claims as well as
claims for money or damages based on contract. (Gov Code § 945.4.)
          Under Government Code Section 910, a claim submitted by the claimant must include various categories of information, including subsection (c) which specifies that the claim must detail the date, place, and other circumstances of the occurrence or transaction that gave rise to the claim. (Gov Code § 910(c).)                    A failure or refusal to amend a claim, whether or not notice of insufficiency is given under Section 910.8, shall not constitute a defense to any action brought upon the cause of action for which the claim was presented if the court finds that the claim as presented complied substantially with Sections 910 and 910.2 or a form provided under Section 910.4. (Gov Code § 910.6(b).)
 
Under Government Code
Section 910, a claimant must provide various pieces of information in a claim
to a government entity. Currently, the only information in dispute between the
parties is the location of the incident. The Defendant, City of Los Angeles,
contends that the Plaintiff needed to provide a precise address to meet the
requirements for substantial compliance of the statute. Plaintiff argues that
the location provided in the claim, "6th Street and St. Andrews Place, Los
Angeles, CA, 90013" substantially complies with the requirements under
Government Code Section 910.
Substantial Compliance
        The
claim requirement is not designed to “eliminate meritorious actions” (Stockett
v. Association of California Water Agencies Joint Powers Ins. Authority
(2004) 34 Cal.4th 441, 446, citing Blair v. Superior Court (1990) 218
Cal.App.3d 221, 225), and “ ‘should not be applied to snare the unwary where
its purpose has been satisfied’ ” (ibid., quoting Elias v. San Bernardino
County Flood Control Dist. (1977) 68 Cal.App.3d 70, 74 (Elias)). Consistent
with these principles, California courts have, for nearly 80 years, applied a
rule of substantial compliance to determine whether a plaintiff has satisfied
the requirements of the act, its predecessors, or similar requirements in local
charters or codes. Under that rule, a claim may be deemed sufficient “if it
substantially complies with all of the statutory requirements for [a] valid claim
even though it is technically deficient in one or more particulars.”  (Santee v. Santa Clara County Office of
Education (1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 702, 713.) 
“The doctrine is based on the premise that substantial compliance
fulfills the purpose of the claims statutes, namely, to give the public entity
timely notice of the nature of the claim so that it may investigate and settle
those having merit without litigation.” 
(Ibid.; see City of San Jose v. Superior Court, supra, 12 Cal.3d
447, 455-457; Phillips v. Desert Hospital Dist., supra, 49 Cal.3d 699,
707.)  The basic principle is that if a
claim is sufficient to fulfill the statute’s purposes, and its deficiencies
inflict no harm on the defendant, the statute will not be applied to impose a
forfeiture of the plaintiff’s cause of action. 
(See Carlino v. Los Angeles County Flood Control Dist., supra, 10
Cal.App.4th 1526, 1534 [“If a claim satisfies the purposes of the claims
statutes without prejudice to the government, substantial compliance will be
found.”].)
Case law distinguishes
between two types of cases concerning compliance with statutory requirements:
those where there has been some compliance but the information provided is
deficient in some way, such as an error in the street number where the incident
occurred, and those cases where compliance is entirely missing, such as not
providing the location where the incident occurred at all. (City of San Jose
v. Superior Court (1974) 12 Cal.3d 447, 456.)
For the first type of
cases, California courts have taken a liberal view of claims statutes where a
reasonable attempt has been made to comply with the law in good faith. ( Johnson
v. City of Los Angeles (1955), 134 Cal.App.2d 600, 602.) California cases
involving defective compliance with claims statutes have invariably held such
attempts constituted substantial compliance. (Uttley v. City of Santa Ana
(1933), 136 Cal.App. 23, 26.) On the other hand, our courts have consistently
held that substantial compliance cannot be predicated upon noncompliance. (Ghiozzi
v. City of South San Francisco (1946), 72 Cal.App.2d 472, 477; Eppstein
v. City of Berkeley (1942), 52 Cal.App.2d 395, 397.) 
Analysis
The Defendant
incorrectly conflates the notion that a precise location was not provided with
the assertion that no location was provided at all. Defendant cites to cases
that involve complete omissions, such as Loehr v. Ventura County Community
College Dist. (1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 1071, 1083, where the court's decision
was based on the total absence of location information. 
However, that is not
the situation in this case, as the Plaintiff's claim notified the City that the
incident occurred at the intersection of 6th Street and St. Andrew Place.
Moreover, courts have routinely found that Plaintiffs substantially comply even
when the wrong address is provided, as long as the Plaintiff acted in good
faith to provide the requested information.
For example, In Johnson
v. City of Oakland, 188 Cal.App.2d 181, 183, the court found substantial
compliance when Plaintiff fell on a defective sidewalk in front of 1819 34th
Avenue, but the verified claim incorrectly indicated 1819 35th Avenue. In Parodi
v. City County of San Francisco, 160 Cal.App.2d 577, the court found
substantial compliance although the claim referred to the wrong intersection.
The same result was reached in Johnson v. City of Los Angeles, 134
Cal.App.2d 600, where the plaintiff tripped on a hole in the sidewalk on the
southwest corner of an intersection but the claim specified the southeast
corner. In Rowan v. City etc. of San Francisco (1966) 244 Cal.App.2d 308, the claim described place of
accident as 3350 Scott St. instead of 3358-3360 Scott St. 
A mistaken address’s impacts on Defendant's
ability to investigate the claim is significantly more than if the exact
address of the incident was not provided. In cases of a mistaken address, the defendant
is directed to an incorrect location where it cannot ascertain where the
incident occurred. Nevertheless, the court, adhering to a longstanding liberal
view that prioritizes a reasonable attempt to comply with the law in good
faith, has found substantial compliance in these instances. The City does not
dispute that the Plaintiff submitted the information in good faith and has
presented no evidence to suggest otherwise. Under the circumstances here, Plaintiff’s
claim has substantially complied with the statutory requirement and Defendant’s
motion for judgment on the pleadings is DENIED.
