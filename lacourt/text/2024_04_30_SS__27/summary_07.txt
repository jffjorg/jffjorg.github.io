And here is the English text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The defendant argued that the wet floor was open and obvious, but the judge found that the evidence presented by the defendant did not satisfy the initial burden of proving that no reasonable minds could differ in concluding that the danger posed by the wet tiles were open and obvious. The judge found that the defendant's evidence did not establish that the tiles were visibly wet at the time of the incident, and that the plaintiff's testimony showed that reasonable minds could differ as to whether the tiles were visibly and obviously wet. The judge also found that the defendant's evidence did not provide sufficient evidence to support the claim that the wet tiles were open and obvious.
