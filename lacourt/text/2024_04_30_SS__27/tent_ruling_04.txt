Legal Standards 
 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the
complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be
apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.30, 430.70). The only issue
involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands,
unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action. [Citation.]” Hahn,
supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at p. 747, citing SKF Farms v. Superior Court
(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) 
 
Government Claims Act
 
Under the Government Claims Act, the general rule is that any
party with a claim for money or damages against a public entity must first file
a claim directly with that entity; only if that claim is denied or rejected may
the claimant file a lawsuit.  (Gov’t Code §§ 905, 945.4; City of Ontario v.
Superior Court (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 894.)  This provides the public
entity with an opportunity to evaluate the claim and make a determination as to
whether it will pay on the claim.  (Roberts v. County of Los Angeles
(2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 474.)  Failure to timely file a tort claim renders
the complaint subject to demurrer.  ¿(V.C. v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist.¿(2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 499, 509—affirming trial court decision to
sustain demurrer without leave to amend on the ground that V.C.'s failure to
timely comply with the requirements of the Tort Claims Act barred her action.) 
 
Where a public entity provides written notice that a claim has
been rejected, the claimant has six months from the date the notice was
personally delivered or deposited in the mail to file suit.  (Gov’t Code §
945.6(a)(1).)   
 
Judicial
Notice
 
Defenant County of Los Angeles’s request for judicial notice is
granted. (Cal.
Evid. Code § 452.)
 
Analysis
 
On April 8,
2022, Plaintiffs Brandon Cardona and Michelle Saenz filed a complaint against
the City of Venice, alleging that on March 30, 2021, Cardona was attacked by a
dog while playing at Oakwood Park, resulting in a fall that broke his right
wrist among other injuries. On January 26, 2024, the County of Los Angeles was
named as a Defendant, and on February 28, 2024, it was served. On March 26,
2024, the County of Los Angeles filed a demurrer, arguing that the Plaintiffs
failed to file a claim with the county under the Government Claims Act before
initiating a lawsuit against the county.
 
Defendant County
of Los Angeles has met its meet and confer requirement prior to the filing of
the demurrer. On March 20, 2024, the Parties discussed the contents of the
demurrer over the phone and Plaintiffs’ counsel expressed his belief that a
claim had been filed with the County of Los Angeles and would provide proof of
the filing. (Declaration of Amber Logan ¶ 6.) However, as of March 26, 2024,
when the motion was filed, Plaintiffs’ counsel had not provided Defendant’s
counsel with proof that a claim had been filed under the Government Claims Act
(Declaration of Amber Logan ¶ 7). The County of Los Angeles also searched its
electronic database and it revealed that no claim was filed under either
Plaintiff’s name for an incident on March 30, 2021. Plaintiffs did not file an
opposition contesting the demurrer or any other filing showing that a claim
under the Government Claims Act had been filed prior to initiating suit against
the County of Los Angeles.
 
Furthermore, the complaint seeks monetary damages against
Defendant.  However, the complaint does not allege facts demonstrating
compliance with the pre-litigation governmental claims requirements. 
 
The Demurrer is therefore sustained in its
entirety. Leave to amend will be granted upon Plaintiff showing that a claim
under the Government
Claims Act has been
filed prior to filing a lawsuit against Defendant County of Los Angeles.
