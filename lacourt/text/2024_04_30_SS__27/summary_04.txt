And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling sustains the demurrer filed by the Defendant County of Los Angeles, dismissing the complaint brought by Plaintiffs Brandon Cardona and Michelle Saenz. The Plaintiffs alleged that Cardona was attacked by a dog while playing at Oakwood Park, resulting in injuries. However, the County of Los Angeles argued that the Plaintiffs failed to file a claim with the county under the Government Claims Act before initiating a lawsuit. The court found that the Plaintiffs did not provide proof of a claim filed under the Government Claims Act and that the complaint does not allege facts demonstrating compliance with the pre-litigation governmental claims requirements. The court granted leave to amend, allowing the Plaintiffs to show that a claim under the Government Claims Act has been filed prior to filing a lawsuit against the County of Los Angeles.
