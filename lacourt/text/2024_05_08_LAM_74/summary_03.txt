Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendants. The defendants have filed a demurrer to the plaintiff's second amended complaint, alleging that the plaintiff has not stated a cause of action for breach of lease, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, conspiracy to defraud, negligence, conversion, rescission, and declaratory relief.

The court has ruled that the plaintiff's causes of action for breach of lease and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing are sufficient. However, the court has sustained the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's causes of action for conspiracy to defraud, negligence, and conversion, with leave to amend.

The court has also sustained the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's cause of action for rescission, without leave to amend. The court has overruled the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's causes of action for declaratory relief and unfair business practices.

The court has ordered the defendants to give notice of its ruling.
