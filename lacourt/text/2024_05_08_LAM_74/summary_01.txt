  - "If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action . . . without having served a valid objection . . . fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, the party giving notice may move for an order compelling the deponent's attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice."

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling orders the plaintiff, Glenn Feldman, to appear for a deposition on June 5, 2024. The judge grants the defendants' motion to compel the plaintiff's production of documents responsive to request nos. 1-89. The judge also grants the defendants' request for sanctions, ordering the plaintiff to pay the defendants' counsel $4,260 in attorney fees and costs within 30 days of the order. The judge finds that the plaintiff's objections to the notice of deposition are invalid and that the defendants' meet and confer efforts were sufficient. The judge also reduces the award of attorney fees and costs due to the defendants' counsel's excessive billing hours.
