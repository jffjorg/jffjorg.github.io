The court grants the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay the proceedings. The plaintiff, Setareh Nelson, signed an attorney-client agreement that provides for arbitration of all disputes, including claims of malpractice. The defendants, Rombro & Manley, LLP, and S. Roger Rombro, filed the motion after the plaintiff filed a complaint alleging professional negligence – legal malpractice. The court finds that the plaintiff has not filed a timely opposition to the motion, and therefore grants the defendants' motion.
