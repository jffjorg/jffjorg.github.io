Nelson v. Rombro & Manley, LLP, et al.
Defendants’ Motion to Compel
Arbitration and Stay Proceedings
 
BACKGROUND 
            This
action arises from an attorney-client dispute.
            On
September 11, 2023, Plaintiff Setareh Nelson (Plaintiff) filed a complaint
against Defendants Rombro & Manley, LLP and S. Roger Rombro (Defendants).
The complaint alleges professional negligence – legal malpractice.
            On
April 4, 2024, Defendants filed this motion to compel arbitration and stay the
proceedings.
DISCUSSION
            Defendants
seek to compel arbitration and stay proceedings. To that end, Defendants attach
the parties’ attorney-client agreement, which provides for arbitration of all
disputes arising from the agreement, including claims of malpractice. (Rombro
Decl., ¶ 4; Ex. A.) The court grants Defendants’ motion because Plaintiff
signed the agreement and alleges legal malpractice in the complaint. Moreover,
Plaintiff has not filed a timely opposition. 
CONCLUSION
The
court grants Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration and stay the proceedings.
Defendants
shall give notice.
