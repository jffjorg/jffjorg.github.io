BACKGROUND
 
This is an unlawful detainer action
involving the non-payment of rent. Plaintiff Shake Amzoyan filed a complaint
against Defendant Jaclyn Ann Kerrigan on August 10, 2023. Plaintiff served
Defendant a 3-day notice to pay rent or quit. 
 
Trial was held on January 11, 12, 16,
and 17 2024. Jury found in favor of Plaintiff. 
 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorney Fees is GRANTED. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff Shake Amzoyan moves this court for an order awarding
Plaintiff its attorney fees and costs in the amount of $8,500.00 against
Defendant Jaclyn Ann Kerigan on the grounds that Plaintiff is the prevailing
party pursuant to the Lease Agreement entered into between Plaintiff and
Defendant and is thus entitled to his attorney fees and costs. 
 
A prevailing party is entitled to recover costs, including
attorneys’ fees, as a matter of right, except as otherwise expressly provided
by statute. (See CCP §§ 1032(a)(4), 1032(b), 1033.5.) A prevailing
party is “the party with a net monetary recovery, a defendant in whose favor a
dismissal is entered, a defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains
any relief, and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any
relief against that defendant.” (Id., § 1032(a)(4).) However, “[w]here
an action has been voluntarily dismissed or dismissed pursuant to a settlement
of the case, there shall be no prevailing party for purposes of [Civil Code
section 1717].” (Civ. Code, § 1717(b)(2); see Shapira v. Lifetech
Resources, LLC (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 429, 441 (“A trial court
lacks discretion to award fees under section 1717(b)(2) where a case has been
voluntarily dismissed.”); see also Santisas v. Goodin (1998)
17 Cal.4th 599, 615.)   
 
First, the court notes Plaintiff is the prevailing party pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 1032 and is entitled to attorney fees
pursuant to Civil Code 1717. Plaintiff presents a copy of the lease agreement,
which includes the following language:  
 
ATTORNEY’S FEES. Should it become
necessary for Lessor to employ an attorney to enforce any of the conditions or
covenants hereof, including the collection of rentals or gaining possession of
the Premises, Lessee agrees to pay all expenses so incurred, including a
reasonable attorneys’ fees. 
 
As Plaintiff prevailed on their claims at trial, Plaintiff is
entitled to recover their costs and attorneys’ fees against Defendant as the
prevailing party. 
 
Next, the court finds $8,500.00 to be a reasonable amount of
attorney fees. “Even after determining that a party is entitled to fees because
it ‘prevailed,’ the trial court must still determine what amount of fees would
be ‘reasonable’ in light of the relative extent or degree of the party's
success in obtaining the results sought.” (Sokolow v. County of San Mateo
(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 231, 247.)
 
Counsel for Plaintiff, Anthony Marinaccio, declares that he
charged Plaintiff a flat fee of $8,500 rather than his hourly rate of $350.
(Marinaccio Decl. ¶11.) Mr. Marinaccio states this rate is average for the area
and the work performed and moreover, the instant action was subject to numerous
continuances and appearances, which were mainly requested by Defendant.
(Marinaccio Decl. ¶¶11, 12.) Additionally, several of the hearings lasted
several hours and there were three mandatory settlement conferences in this
matter. (Marinaccio Decl. ¶¶13, 14.) Counsel was also required to prepare all
of the trial documents and file them with the court. (Marinaccio Decl. ¶16.)
Counsel believes if he had billed Plaintiff at his hourly rate, he would have
incurred significantly more fees than what Plaintiff is seeking in this motion.
(Marinaccio Decl. ¶17.)
 
Considering the foregoing, the court finds $8,500.00 in attorney
fees reasonable given the nature of the action and the type of work
required. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion for attorney fees is GRANTED. 
 
Memorandum of Costs
 
Concerning costs, Plaintiff filed a memorandum of costs on February
1, 2024 requesting 608.60 in costs for filing and motion fees and service of
process fees.  Upon review of the
memorandum, the costs are allowed. No papers have been filed to tax or strike
costs. 
 
Plaintiff’s Memorandum of Costs is GRANTED.
