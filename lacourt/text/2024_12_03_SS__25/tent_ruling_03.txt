ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background
 
 
On or about October 3, 2016, Plaintiffs
Paul Cosaro and Stephanie Cosaro (“Plaintiffs”) entered into a written Lease
Agreement (the “Lease Agreement”) with Defendant Kenneth Raguse (“Defendant”)
regarding a single-residence home. (Compl., ¶ 9.) Over the years, the
parties repeatedly renewed the lease in yearly increments. (Compl., ¶ 10.) In or around
October 2023, the parties entered into an extension of the Lease Agreement with
a termination date of October 14, 2024. (Compl., ¶ 11, Exh. B.) However, Defendant vacated the premises on
January 18, 2024. (Compl.,
¶ 12.) Plaintiffs contend that Defendant breached the Lease Agreement by
“vacating the Premises prior to the full term of the Lease and by leaving the
Premises in a poor and damaged condition, including but not limited to the
evidence of rats,” and failing to pay rent for the full term of the lease until
October 14, 2024. (Compl., ¶¶ 14-15.) 
 
On April 17, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a
Complaint against Defendant, alleging a single cause of action of Breach of
Contract. 
 
On October 28, 2024, Defendant filed an
Answer and the instant Motion to Compel Mediation and Request for Stay of
Proceedings (the “Motion”). No Opposition was filed.
 
On November 19, 2024, Defendant filed a
“Notice of Non-Opposition to Defendant Kenneth Raguse’s Motion to Compel Mediation
and Request for Stay of Proceedings,” notifying the Court that Plaintiffs had
not filed an Opposition to the Motion by the statutory deadline.
 
II.                
Discussion
 
Defendant moves to compel mediation on
the grounds that the Lease Agreement mandates mediation as a condition
precedent to filing a complaint in court. (Motion, p. 3.) 
 
The Lease Agreement states, in
pertinent part: 
 
“39. MEDIATION: 
A. Consistent with paragraphs B and C
below, Landlord and Tenant agree to mediate any dispute or claim arising
between them out of this Agreement, or any resulting transaction, before
resorting to court action. Mediation fees, if any, shall be divided equally
among the parties involved. If, for any dispute or claim to which this
paragraph applies, any party commences an action without first attempting to
resolve the matter through mediation, or refuses to mediate after a request has
been made, then that party shall not be entitled to recover attorney fees, even
if they would otherwise be available to that party in any such action. 
 
B. The following matters are excluded
from mediation: (i) an unlawful detainer action; (ii) the filing or enforcement
of a mechanic’s lien; and (iii) any matter within the jurisdiction of a
probate, small claims or bankruptcy court. The filing of a court action to
enable the recording of a notice of pending action, for order of attachment,
receivership, injunction, or other provisional remedies, shall not constitute a
waiver of the mediation provision.
 
C. Landlord and Tenant agree to
mediate disputes or claims involving the Listing Agent. Leasing Agent or
property manager (“Broker”), provided Broker shall have agreed to such
mediation prior to, or within a reasonable amount of time after, the dispute or
claim is presented to such Broker. Any election by Broker to participate in
mediation shall not result in Broker being deemed a party to this Agreement.” 
 
(Motion, Exh. A; Compl., Exh. B.) 
 
            Here,
Defendant fails to cite to any legal authority to support the Motion. However, the
Court utilizes its discretion to order a status conference on the status of a
mediation date given the express terms of the parties’ Lease Agreement and the
lack of opposition or argument against the validity of the Lease Agreement
signed by the parties. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.891; Jeld-Wen, Inc.
v. Superior Court (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 536, 540-541.) Thus, the Motion is
CONTINUED.
 
            That
said, the Court does not find, and Defendant fails to present, any authority to
stay the proceedings pending mediation. Thus, Defendant’s request to stay the
proceedings is DENIED.
 
 
III.
