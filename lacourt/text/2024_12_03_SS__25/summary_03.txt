And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to compel mediation, but only to continue the hearing to January 14, 2025. The judge also denies the defendant's request to stay the proceedings pending mediation. The court orders a status conference on the status of the mediation proceedings for January 14, 2025, and requires counsel to electronically file a report five court days prior to the hearing date. The court also orders the moving party to give notice.

The judge's decision is based on the express terms of the parties' lease agreement, which mandates mediation before resorting to court action. The court utilized its discretion to order a status conference to explore the possibility of mediation, despite the lack of opposition or argument against the validity of the lease agreement signed by the parties. However, the court denied the defendant's request to stay the proceedings pending mediation, as the defendant failed to present any authority to support this request.
