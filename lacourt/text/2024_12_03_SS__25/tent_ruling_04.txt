ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On August 15, 2024, Plaintiff Angela
Sanguen Sheen (“Plaintiff”) initiated this action against Defendant Artur
Simonian (“Defendant”) and Does 1-20 alleging Motor Vehicle and General
Negligence causes of action. (Compl., pp. 4-5.) The action arises from a motor
vehicle accident that occurred on August 23, 2022. (Compl., p. 5.) Plaintiff
alleges she sustained injuries, pain, suffering, severe emotional distress, and
damages as a result of Defendant’s conduct. (Compl., p. 5.)
 
On October 25, 2024, Defendant filed a
Demurrer to the Complaint (the “Demurrer”).
 
On November 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed
an Opposition. 
 
On November 22, 2024, Defendant filed
a Reply.
 
II.                
Procedural
Issues
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.40
states: “A person against whom a complaint or cross-complaint has been filed
may, within 30 days after service of the complaint or cross-complaint, demur to
the complaint or cross-complaint.” 
 
Here, Plaintiff served Defendant with
the Summons and Complaint by personal service on September 15, 2024. Defendant
filed a Demurrer on October 25, 2024, 10 days after the 30-day time period set
forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 430.40 expired. However, the parties
stipulated to an extension of time for Defendant to file a responsive pleading
to the Complaint. 
 
Thus, the Court uses its discretion to
hear the Demurrer on the merits. (Jackson v. Doe (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th
742, 749-750.)
 
III.             
Legal
Standard
 
“As a general matter, in a
demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading
or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co.
(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the pleading alone,
and not the evidence or facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants,
Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such, the court assumes
the truth of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Ibid.)
The only issue a demurrer is concerned with is whether the complaint, as it
stands, states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
A general demurrer may be
brought under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (e) if
insufficient facts are stated to support the cause of action asserted or under
section 430.10, subdivision (a), where the court has no jurisdiction of the subject
of the cause of action alleged in the pleading. All other grounds listed in
Section 430.10, including uncertainty under subdivision (f), are special
demurrers. Special demurrers are not allowed in limited jurisdiction courts.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 92, subd. (c).) 
Where a demurrer is
sustained, leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable
possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18
Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to show the court that a
pleading can be amended successfully. (Id.; Lewis v. YouTube, LLC (2015)
244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) However, “[i]f there is any reasonable possibility
that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to sustain a
demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).
IV.             
Judicial
Notice Request
 
Defendant requests the Court take
judicial notice of certain documents from the prior small claims action in this
matter. Having reviewed the moving papers on Defendant’s request, the Court
takes judicial notice of the claim and order, judgment, and notice of entry of
judgment in the Small Claims action Sheen v. Simonian, LASC Case No. 24STSC01333,
pursuant to California Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (c). 
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s request for
judicial notice is GRANTED.
 
V.               
Discussion

 
A.    Meet and Confer
 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 430.41 requires that “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this
chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person, by telephone, or
by video conference with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer
for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would
resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41, subd. (a).) The parties are to meet and confer at least five days
before the date the responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41,
subd. (a)(2).) Thereafter, the demurring party shall file and serve a
declaration detailing their meet and confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41, subd. (a)(3).) 
The Demurrer is accompanied by a meet
and confer declaration as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41,
subdivision (a). (Demurrer, Aivadjian Decl.) According to the declaration and
accompanying exhibit, Defendant’s counsel called Plaintiff’s counsel and, when
there was no answer, Defendant’s counsel followed up by email. (Demurrer,
Aivadijian Decl., Exh. D.) Over email, Plaintiff’s counsel granted Defendant’s
counsel’s request for an extension on the time to file a responsive pleading,
and then the parties discussed the contents of the Demurrer. (Demurrer, Aivadijian
Decl., Exh. D.) 
 
Thus, the Court finds the meet and
confer requirement satisfied.
 
B.     Demurrer 
 
Moving Party Position
 
Defendant demurs to the entire Complaint
on the basis the action was resolved in a small claims action that bars
relitigating their claims. (Demurrer Notice, p. 3; Demurrer, p. 4.)
Specifically, Defendant contends Plaintiff’s Complaint is barred under the
doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel. (Demurrer, p. 6.) Regarding res
judicata, Defendant argues the basis for relief in the instant lawsuit is
identical to the basis for relief in the previous lawsuit – “namely, alleged
negligence arising out of the same motor vehicle against the same Defendant” –
and thus the instant action is barred under res judicata. (Demurrer, p. 7.)
Regarding collateral estoppel, Defendant contends the issue decided in the
prior adjudication is identical to the issue presented in the instant action,
there was a final adjudication on the merits in the previous small claims action,
and the party against whom the plea is asserted was a party in the prior
adjudication. (Demurrer, p. 8.) 
 
            Opposition

 
            In
Opposition, Plaintiff does not dispute the previous small claims action.
However, Plaintiff contends the doctrines of collateral estoppel and res
judicata do not bar the instant action because Plaintiff’s previous claim was
solely for “property damage expenses, deductible, and loss of usage” whereas
the instant claim is “for injury to person.” (Opp., 3.) Plaintiff alleges “[p]ersonal
injury claim is classified as distinct from injury to property,” and thus the
instant action is not barred by either res judicata or collateral estoppel.
(Opp., p. 3.)
 
            Reply
 
            In
Reply, Defendant reiterates the points made in the Motion and contends the
instant action is barred by both res judicata and collateral estoppel. (Reply,
pp. 2-3.) 
 
            Allegations
in the Complaint 
 
The Complaint alleges Motor Vehicle
and General Negligence causes of action and contends Plaintiff has suffered
wage loss, loss of use of property, hospital and medical expenses, general
damage, property damage, and loss of earning capacity. (Compl., ¶¶ 10, 11.)
Plaintiff contends the action arose from a motor vehicle accident that occurred
on August 23, 2022 at Vermont Ave., south of Third St., in the city of Los
Angeles, CA 90020. (Compl., ¶ MV-1, p. 5.) Defendant allegedly operated a motor
vehicle, employed a person who operated a motor vehicle, owned a motor vehicle,
entrusted a motor vehicle, or was an agent and employee of the other defendants
and acted within the scope of the agency. (Compl., ¶ MV-2.)
 
            Analysis

 
Defendant demurs to both causes of action
in the Complaint on the grounds of collateral estoppel and res judicata.
 
Collateral Estoppel
 
The elements of collateral estoppel
are (1) a claim or issue raised in the present action is identical to a claim
or issue litigated in a prior proceeding; (2) the prior proceeding resulted in
a final judgment on the merits; (3) the party against whom the doctrine is
being asserted was a party or in privity with a party to the prior proceeding;
and (4) issue to be precluded was actually litigated and necessarily decided.
(Zevnik v. Superior Court (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 76, 83.)
 
Here, the small claims action resulted
in a final judgment on the merits following a non-jury trial, and Defendant,
the party against whom the doctrine is being asserted, was a party in the prior
proceeding. However, the issue of whether Defendant is liable for Plaintiff’s
loss of wages, hospital and medical expenses, and loss of earning capacity
(Compl., ¶ 11) was not actually litigated or necessarily decided in the prior
suit. Indeed, the prior small claims action involved the issue of whether
Defendant owed Plaintiff money for “[p]roperty damages expenses, deductible and
loss of usage.” (Demurrer, Aivadjian Decl., Exh. A, ¶ 3.)
 
Thus, the elements of collateral
estoppel are not satisfied, and the issue raised in the Complaint is not barred
under the doctrine of collateral estoppel. 
 
            Res
Judicata 
 
“ ‘ “Res judicata” describes the
preclusive effect of a final judgment on the merits. Res judicata, or claim
preclusion, prevents relitigation of the same cause of action in a second suit
between the same parties or parties in privity with them.’ [Citation.] ‘A
predictable doctrine of res judicata benefits both the parties and the courts
because it “seeks to curtail multiple litigation causing vexation and expense
to the parties and wasted effort and expense in judicial administration.” ’
[Citation.]” (Consumer Advocacy Group, Inc. v. ExxonMobil Corp.¿(2008)
168 Cal.App.4th 675, 683.)  
 
“A prior judgment is not¿res¿judicata¿on a subsequent
action unless three¿elements¿are satisfied:¿‘(1) the issues decided in the
prior adjudication are identical with those presented in the later action; (2)
there was a final judgment on the merits in the prior action; and (3) the party
against whom the plea is raised was a party or was in privity with a party to
the prior adjudication. [Citation.]’ ” (Id., at pp. 685-86.) “To prevent
piecemeal litigation, the doctrine of res judicata also applies to bar a second
suit arising out of the same factual situation involving matters which were
relevant and within the same scope of the first action, which thus could
have been raised in the first suit. [Citation.]” (Duffy v. City of Long
Beach (1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 1352, 1257-58.) 
Here, Plaintiff filed a small claims
action against Defendant on March 20, 2024 regarding the motor vehicle accident
that occurred on August 23, 2022. (Demurrer, Aivadjian Decl., Exh. A, ¶ 3.) The
small claims court entered judgment for Defendant against Plaintiff for a total
of $0.00 following a non-jury trial. (Demurrer, Aivadjian Decl., Exhs. B, C.)
 
The Court finds the elements of res
judicata are satisfied. The sole claim decided in the prior adjudication is
identical with the later action – namely, Defendant’s liability in the motor
vehicle accident that occurred on August 23, 2022. (Demurrer, Aivadjian Decl.,
Exh. A, ¶ 3; Compl.) While personal injury damages are different in kind from property
damages as Plaintiff suggests, the instant suit arises out of the same factual
situation as the first suit and involves “matters which were relevant and
within the same scope of the first action, which thus could have been
raised in the first suit.” (Duffy, supra, 201 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1257-58;
see Wade v. Ports America Management Corp. (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 648,
658, citing Thibodeau v. Crum (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 749, 755; Holmes,
et al. v. David H. Bricker, Inc. (1969) 70 Cal.2d 786.) Indeed, “[a] mere
change in the form of relief requested does not avoid the res judicata bar.” (Duffy,
supra, 201 Cal.App.3d at p. 1358.) As to the remaining requirements for res
judicata, there was a final judgment on the merits in the prior action
following a non-jury trial (Demurrer, Aivadjian Decl., Exh. B), and Defendant
was the same party in the prior adjudication. 
 
Thus, Plaintiff’s request for personal
injury damages should have been brought in the first action and is now
precluded under the doctrine of res judicata. 
 
            Accordingly,
Defendant’s Demurrer is SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND under the doctrine of
res judicata.
C.     Conclusion & Order

Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint is SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.
