ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On April 19, 2013, Judgment Creditor American
Contractors Indemnity (“American Contractors”) filed an action against Judgment
Debtors Gustavo Miranda (“Miranda”), Armando Torres (“Armando”), and Laura
Torres (“Laura”), alleging causes of action for Breach of Contract and Common
Counts. (Compl., p. 1.) American Contractors is a surety company licensed to do
business in California. (Compl., ¶ 1.) On or about May 23, 2004, Miranda,
Armando, and Laura executed a Bond Application and Indemnity Agreement in favor
of American Contractors. (Compl., ¶ 3.) In consideration of the Agreement and
in reliance of Miranda, Armando, and Laura’s promises to save American
Contractors from any and all claims, American Contractors issued and executed a
Motor Vehicle Dealer Bond, No. 9086203, which named Miranda as Principal, and
the California Department of Motor Vehicles as obligee. (Compl., ¶ 4.)
Subsequently, claims were filed against the Bond as a result of Miranda’s
violations of the Vehicle Code, and American Contractors “was required to
comply with its obligations under the Bond, causing damages in the total amount
of $19,575.” (Compl., ¶ 6.)
 
Default was entered against Armando on
July 10, 2013, Laura on August 5, 2013, and Miranda on September 9, 2013. 
 
On April 22, 2014, a default judgment
of $29,854.73 was entered against Miranda, Armando, and Laura, reflecting damages,
prejudgment interest at the annual rate of 10 percent, attorney fees, and costs.
(4/22/14 Default Judgment.) American Contractors gave Miranda, Armando, and
Laura notice of the entry of judgment on April 26, 2014 via regular mail. (5/2/14
Notice of Entry of Judgment or Order, Proof of Service.) The notice of entry of
judgment was filed with the Court on May 2, 2014. (5/2/14 Notice of Entry of
Judgment or Order.) 
 
On September 28, 2021, Miranda, in pro
per, filed a Motion to Vacate Judgment. On October 14, 2021, American
Contractors filed an Opposition.
 
On October 27, 2021, the Court denied Miranda’s
Motion to Vacate Judgment. In so finding, the Court addressed and rejected Miranda’s
arguments that (1) the Judgment was void against him for lack of personal
service; (2) service was ineffective because Miranda was substitute served at
his mother’s residence where he did not live, (3) the Judgment was void because
the Complaint filed by American Contractors was not verified, and (4) Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure, rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) apply to this matter. (10/27/21
Order, pp. 2-5.) Further, the Court noted “Miranda unreasonably waited over 7
years before moving to vacate the judgment without any documentary evidence
demonstrating the judgment is void for lack of jurisdiction. Further, [American
Contractor’s] presents evidence that Debtor Miranda discussed settling the
matter via email with [American Contractor’s] counsel’s office between July
2013 and July 2014. (Oppo., Murray Decl., ¶¶ 9-18, Exhs. C-K.) Notably, on July
7, 2014, an associate attorney with [American Contractor’s] counsel’s firm
expressly informed Debtor Miranda a judgment of $29,854.73 had been entered
against him when discussing terms of settlement, which Debtor Miranda rejected
over email. (Oppo., Murray Decl., ¶ 18, Exh. K.).” (10/27/21 Order, p. 5.)
 
On October 25, 2023, American
Contractors renewed the Judgment against Miranda, Armando, and Laura.
 
On October 23, 2024, Miranda filed the
instant “Notice of a Defendant Motion and Motion to Void a Default Judgment for
Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction and Fraud” (the “Motion”). No Opposition
has been filed.
 
II.                
Procedural
Issues
 
Before addressing the merits of the
Motion, the Court notes Miranda failed to provide proper proof of service.
Indeed, the proof of service filed with the Motion is missing various pieces of
information, including the name, employer, and business address of the person
who effected service; the date of service; the declaration under penalty of
perjury; and the name and signature of the person who effected service.
(Motion, p. 22.) 
 
Further, the Court notes Miranda also gave
American Contractors improper notice of this hearing. Specifically, the Notice
of Motion incorrectly states that the Motion would be heard at “111 North Hill
Street, Los Angeles, California 90012.” (Notice of Motion.) This is the address
for the Stanley Mosk Courthouse, not the Spring Street Courthouse in which this
Department is located. Should American Contractors wish to attend the hearing
and present oral argument, they will be unable to do so. 
 
Miranda is ordered to correct file new
proof of service and correct the errors noted herein.
