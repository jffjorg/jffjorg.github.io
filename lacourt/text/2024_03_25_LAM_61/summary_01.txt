Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling on a motion to quash a deposition subpoena issued to Sorenson Communications, LLC, Louise Sulka's current employer. The subpoena seeks records related to Sulka's employment with Sorenson, including documents referring to Sulka's employment, payroll, and records from 2017 to present. Sulka argues that the subpoena is overly broad and infringes on her privacy, particularly because she is the plaintiff in an employment-related action. The defendants argue that the information sought is necessary to assess Sulka's claims and to determine the veracity of her complaints of harassment.

The judge finds that Sulka's privacy interest is magnified because the subpoena seeks records from her current employer. However, the defendants have shown good cause for seeking some of the information, including Sulka's compensation at Sorenson, her requests for leave and accommodations, and personnel complaints made by or against Sulka. The judge orders that the defendants may seek this information from Sulka first, and if she does not produce it, they may re-issue a subpoena to Sorenson. The motion to quash is granted subject to these conditions. The judge also declines to award sanctions to either party.
