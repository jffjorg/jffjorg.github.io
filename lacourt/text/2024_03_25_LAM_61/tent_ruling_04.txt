Responses to Special Interrogatories and Requests for Production from Defendant
General Motors are GRANTED as to the Requests for
Production, with the condition that Defendant shall redact requests containing
personal identifying information of customers. The motion is GRANTED as to
Interrogatories No. 23, 25, 39,
41, and 43, and DENIED as to Interrogatories No. 14, 20, and 26.
 
Plaintiff to provide Notice.
 
I.               
MOTIONS
TO COMPEL FURTHER
“Any party may obtain discovery . . . by propounding to any other party to
the action written interrogatories to be answered under oath.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.010(a).) If a
propounding party is not satisfied with the response served by a responding
party, the former may move the court to compel further interrogatory responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.
Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)  The propounding party must demonstrate that
the responses were incomplete, inadequate or evasive, or that the responding
party asserted objections that are either without merit or too general.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300(a)(1)–(3); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 403.)
“A propounding party may demand a responding
party to produce documents that are in their possession, custody or control.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.010.) A party may likewise conduct discovery by
propounding interrogatories to another party to be answered under oath. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2030.010, subd. (a).) The responding party must respond to the
production demand either by complying, by representing that the party lacks the
ability to comply, or by objecting to the demand. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.210.) The responding party must respond to the interrogatories by
answering or objecting. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.210, subd. (a).) If the
responding party fails to serve timely responses, the propounding party may
move for an order compelling responses to the production demand and
interrogatories. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.)
 
Plaintiff moves to compel further responses
to Requests for Production No. 10, 11, 20, 23–26, 28, 29, 37–39, and 44–68, as
well as Special Interrogatories No. 14, 20, 23, 25, 26, 39, 41, and 43, from
Defendant General Motors, LLC (Defendant).
 
Requests for Production No. 10, 11, 20, and
23–26 concerned Defendant’s warranty policies, procedures, and practices. Requests
No. 28 and 29 sought Defendant’s policies and procedures for issuing recalls
and technical service bulletins. (Separate Statement at pp. 15–19.) Request No.
44 sought documents related to communications with repair facilities concerning
the subject vehicle, while the remaining requests (No. 37–39 and 45–68) concern
documents related to various defects in vehicles of the same year, make, and
model as the subject vehicle, and customer complaints related to the same. For
each request, Defendant responded to the requests with objections, stating that
no documents would be produced. 
 
Defendant argues that Plaintiff did not meet
and confer in good faith. (Opposition at pp. 3–4.) However, this argument is
unpersuasive. The parties exchanged letters regarding the requests and
interrogatories at issue in this motion, and exchanged and signed a protective
order pursuant to Defendant’s request. (Motion Exhs. J–N.) The present motion
followed the parties’ offering irreconcilable positions on the merits of their
respective requests and responses. 
 
Good cause supports the requests for
production. Contrary to Defendant’s arguments in opposition, Plaintiffs
may use evidence of other vehicles to pursue their Song Beverly claims. To
succeed on a claim brought under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, the
plaintiff bears the burden of proving several elements, including nonconformity
of a vehicle that substantially impaired its use, value, or safety,
presentation of a vehicle to a manufacturer or authorized representative for
repair, and failure to repair the defect after a reasonable number of attempts.
(Oregel v. Am. Isuzu Motors, Inc. (“Oregel”) (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.) 
 
A buyer may be entitled to a civil penalty of up to two
times the actual damages upon a showing that the manufacturer willfully failed
to abide by any of its obligations under the Act. (Civ. Code § 1794, subd.
(c).) Evidence that a defendant “adopted internal policies that erected hidden
obstacles to the ability of an unwary consumer to obtain redress under the
Act,” is relevant to a determination of “willfulness” in relation to prayers
for the civil penalty. (Oregel, supra, 90 Cal.App.4th at p. 1105.)
 
There is case authority for this proposition. The court in Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009)
174 Cal.App.4th 967, 993–994, held that Bentley’s failure to turn over customer
complaints regarding defects on other Bentleys to support the plaintiff’s claim
under the Song-Beverly Act was an abuse of discovery so flagrant that the trial
court abused its discretion by not
imposing terminating sanctions. Other cases have embraced an evidentiary rule
similar to that only implicit in Doppes.
In Donlen v. Ford Motor Company
(2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 138, the trial court allowed an expert to testify that a
particular transmission was defective 
because he had heard from “others” that the same transmission in “other
vehicle[s]” was “problematic.” The Court of Appeal held that the “other
vehicle” testimony was properly “limited to the transmission model Ford
installed in plaintiff’s truck and other vehicles.”  (Id.
at p. 154.)  The court held that “[s]uch
evidence certainly was probative and not unduly prejudicial.”  (Ibid.)
And in another case, Santana v. FCA US, LLC (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th
334, 347, the court held that a manufacturer’s internal emails concerning a
mechanical defect in a lemon law case were relevant to show that the
manufacturer “intentionally chose not to honor the express warranty,” and thus
merited civil penalties. Thus Plaintiff is not limited to requests concerning
the particular vehicle at issue. 
 
Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s document requests
impermissibly seek trade-secret material concerning its internal investigations
of car components and warranty policies and procedures. (Opposition at pp.
8–9.) Defendant also argues that the requests may include personally
identifying information for Defendant’s consumers. (Ibid.) Defendant
shall indeed redact consumer identifying information. However, Defendant’s
trade secrets offer no persuasive basis to deny Plaintiff’s request for relevant
discovery, where any confidential materials may be adequately preserved by the
entry of an appropriate protective order, as has already been entered in this
case.
 
Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories No. 14,
20, 23, 25, 26, 39, 41, and 43, largely sought the identification of persons
with information related to the subject matter of this action. Interrogatories
No. 14, 20, and 23 sought the identification of all persons who performed
warranty repairs on the vehicle, who tested or inspected the subject vehicle
during a defined period, and persons with knowledge of Plaintiff’s notice of
defects to Defendant. (Separate Statement at pp. 2–7.) Defendant responded by
pointing to documents such as Global Activity Reports, Global Warranty History
Report, and repair orders for the subject vehicle. (Ibid.) Plaintiff
argues that because the information lies in the custody of Defendant’s agents,
Defendant may be compelled to produce it. (Separate Statement at pp. 2–7.)
 
Plaintiff’s
argument is unpersuasive as to Interrogatories No. 14 and 20. The case cited
for the proposition that the dealerships conducting the relevant repairs are
agents of the manufacturer is Ibrahim v.
Ford Motor Co. (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 878, 886, but this case did not decide
that a car dealership was the agent of a car manufacturer for repair purposes,
but that repairs made by an authorized dealer counted as repairs by a
“representative in this state” for the purpose of calculating a reasonable
number of repair attempts under Civil Code § 1793.2, subd. (d). (Ibrahim,
supra, 214 Cal.app.3d at pp. 885–886.) It did not decide that
dealerships are the agents of manufacturers for the purposes of whether the
given information is in their possession or control. The motion is therefore
DENIED as to Interrogatories No. 14 and 20.
However, Plaintiff’s argument is persuasive as to
Interrogatory No. 23. This interrogatory sought the identification of persons
with knowledge of Plaintiff’s notice to Defendant of defects in the vehicle,
i.e. someone receiving information on Defendant’s behalf. Defendant’s reference
to documents that contain the identifies of those who “serviced, maintained, or
repaired the subject vehicle” under Code of Civil Procedure § 2030.230 is
insufficient, because the interrogatory does not ask for such information. The
motion is GRANTED as to Interrogatory No. 23.
Interrogatories No. 25 and 39 sought the identity of
individuals in Defendant’s customer relations department having jurisdiction
over Plaintiff’s complaint, to which Defendant offered objections. (Separate
Statement at pp. 7–10.) Defendant argues that it has responded by offering
relevant policies and procedures. (Opposition at p. 7.) It has not offered the
identifies of the individuals sought, however. Thus the motion is GRANTED as to
Interrogatories No. 25 and 39.
 Interrogatories No.
41 and 43, sought the identity of individuals responsible for the investigation
of the subject vehicle and the decision whether or not to repurchase or replace
it. (Separate Statement at pp. 11–12.) Defendant responded with objections and
references to a broad array of documents, including a warranty global history
report and repair orders, which plainly offer no responsive information as to
the interrogatories at issue. (Ibid.) The motion is GRANTED as to
Interrogatories No. 41 and 43.
The motion is DENIED, however, as to Interrogatory No. 26,
which sought the identification of Defendant’s employee in California “most
knowledgeable regarding your warranty policies,” given that such an inquiry
properly awaits a notice of deposition served under Code of Civil Procedure §
2025.230. (Separate Statement at p. 9.)
In summary, the motion as to requests for production is
GRANTED, with the condition that Defendant shall redact requests containing
personal identifying information of customers. The motion is GRANTED as to
Interrogatories No. 23, 25, 39, 41, and
43, and DENIED as to Interrogatories No. 14, 20, and 26.
