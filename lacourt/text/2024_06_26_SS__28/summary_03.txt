And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has ruled on the motions to strike and for relief from the late designation of expert witnesses. The plaintiff, Richard Forman, had moved to strike the defendant, City of Los Angeles's, late expert witness designation, while the defendant had moved for relief from its own late designation. The judge denied the plaintiff's motion and granted the defendant's motion. The judge found that the defendant's late designation was due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, and that the plaintiff had not been prejudiced by the delay. The judge also noted that the defendant had made its expert available for immediate deposition and had served its expert witness information in a timely manner after the mistake was discovered.
