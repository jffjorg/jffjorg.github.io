BACKGROUND 
On

On

On

On
May 8, 2024, the Court dismissed Matias, Manwarren, and Does 3-20 with

PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to enter a default judgment against Velozo and award Plaintiff
$349,981.58, consisting of $250,000.00 in general damages, $159,400.00 in
special damages, $5,334.00 in attorney’s fees, and $247.58 in costs. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure
section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a).)  
B.       Damages 
 On a request for default judgment, “[w]here a
cause of action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs to introduce
evidence establishing a prima facie case for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal.
Practice Guide), citing Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357,
361 [trial court erred in applying preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
 “Defaulting parties have a constitutional
right to adequate notice of the maximum judgment that may be assessed against
them.”  (Cal. Practice Guide, supra,
¶ 5:250, p. 5-66.)  However, “[i]n
personal injury and wrongful death actions, the complaint must not state the
amount of damages sought [citations]. 
Therefore, before a default may be entered, plaintiff must serve
defendant with a statement of ‘the nature and amount of damages being sought.’
”  (Id., ¶ 5:82, p. 5-27, citing
Code Civ. Proc., § 425.11.)  “[S]ervice
[of the statement of damages] after default but before prove-up [is] not
sufficient.”  (Ibid.)  “The purpose is to
give defendant ‘one last chance’ to respond, knowing exactly what judgment may
be entered if he or she fails to appear.” 
(Id., ¶ 5:83, p. 5-28.) 
The
relief granted to a plaintiff on entry of a defendant's default cannot exceed
the amount demanded in the complaint or, for personal injury cases where
damages may not be stated in the complaint, the amount listed in the statement
of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a), 585, subd. (b).) “The notice
requirement of section 580 was designed to insure fundamental fairness.” (Becker
v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27 Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures
that “defendants in cases which involve a default judgment have adequate notice
of the judgments that may be taken against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment
other than that which is demanded is taken against him, [the defendant] has
been deprived of his day in court—a right to a hearing on the matter
adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A trial court exceeds its jurisdiction
if it awards damages in excess of the amount specified in the complaint or
statement of damages. (Id. at p. 494.) 
DISCUSSION           Plaintiff asks the Court to award future medical expenses of $144,000.00 based on a recommendation that
he receive two $1,500.00 injections per year for the rest of his life (an
estimated 48 years).  Plaintiff’s
statement of damages, however, did not put Velozo on notice of this element of
damage because it states the amount of future medical expenses is “unknown.”  Therefore, the Court denies Plaintiff’s
request for $144,000.00 in future medical expenses. 
          Plaintiff
also denies Plaintiff’s request for $5,334.00 in attorney’s fees.  Plaintiff has not provided a statutory or
contractual basis for an attorney fee award.  In addition, Plaintiff has not explained how he
calculated the amount requested. 
          The Court
denies Plaintiff’s application for default judgment. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES Plaintiff Ian
Nel’s application for default judgment against Defendant Danilo Velozo. 
The Court sets an Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal
for Failure to Resubmit Default Judgment Packet for 08/26/2024 at 08:30 AM in
Department 28 at the Spring Street Courthouse. 
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
