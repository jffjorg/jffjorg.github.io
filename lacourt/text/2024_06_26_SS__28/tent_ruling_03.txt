LEGAL STANDARD 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2034.300 provides: 
“Except as
provided in Section 2034.310 and in Articles 4 (commencing with Section
2034.610) and 5 (commencing with Section 2034.710), on objection of any party
who has made a complete and timely compliance with Section 2034.260, the trial
court shall exclude from evidence the expert opinion of any witness that is
offered by any party who has unreasonably failed to do any of the following: 
“(a) List
that witness as an expert under Section 2034.260. 
“(b) Submit
an expert witness declaration. 
“(c) Produce
reports and writings of expert witnesses under Section 2034.270. 
“(d) Make
that expert available for a deposition under Article 3 (commencing with Section
2034.410).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2034.300.) 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2034.710
provides:  
“(a) On
motion of any party who has failed to submit expert witness information on the
date specified in a demand for that exchange, the court may grant leave to
submit that information on a later date. 
“(b) A motion
under subdivision (a) shall be made a sufficient time in advance of the time
limit for the completion of discovery under Chapter 8 (commencing with Section
2024.010) to permit the deposition of any expert to whom the motion relates to
be taken within that time limit. Under exceptional circumstances, the court may
permit the motion to be made at a later time. 
“(c) The
motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2034.710.) 
          Code of
Civil Procedure section 2034.720 provides: 
“The court
shall grant leave to submit tardy expert witness information only if all of the
following conditions are satisfied: 
“(a) The
court has taken into account the extent to which the opposing party has relied
on the absence of a list of expert witnesses. 
“(b) The
court has determined that any party opposing the motion will not be prejudiced
in maintaining that party’s action or defense on the merits. 
“(c) The
court has determined that the moving party did all of the following: 
“(1) Failed
to submit the information as the result of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect. 
“(2) Sought
leave to submit the information promptly after learning of the mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. 
“(3) Promptly
thereafter served a copy of the proposed expert witness information described
in Section 2034.260 on all other parties who have appeared in the action. 
“(d) The
order is conditioned on the moving party making the expert available
immediately for a deposition under Article 3 (commencing with Section
2034.410), and on any other terms as may be just, including, but not limited
to, leave to any party opposing the motion to designate additional expert
witnesses or to elicit additional opinions from those previously designated, a
continuance of the trial for a reasonable period of time, and the awarding of
costs and litigation expenses to any party opposing the motion.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2034.720.) 
DISCUSSION 
On March
15, 2024, Plaintiff served a demand for exchange of expert witness information
on Defendant.  The demand set April 8,
2024 as the date of exchange.  On April 8,
2024, Plaintiff served expert witness information on Defendant.  Defendant did not serve its expert witness
information on Plaintiff until April 16, 2024. 
Plaintiff objected to Defendant’s late designation. 
Plaintiff
argues that Defendant’s late designation was unreasonable because (1) it gave
Defendant the unfair advantage of seeing Plaintiff’s expert designation before serving
Defendant’s expert designation, (2) it amounted to gamesmanship, and (3) it
will cause Plaintiff delay in preparing for trial. 
In
response, Defendant argues that the late designation resulted from mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable negligence.  On March 31, 2024, the Deputy City Attorney assigned
to the case left the City Attorney’s office.  On April 8, 2024, Plaintiff served his expert
witness designation on the departed attorney’s supervisor, who had not
previously known about the April 8 exchange deadline.  The supervisor quickly reviewed the matter
and investigated the case.  Eight days
later, on April 16, 2024, Defendant served its expert designation.  When Plaintiff objected to Defendant’s late designation, Defendant offered its expert for immediate deposition. 
The
Court finds no evidence that Defendant engaged in gamesmanship in serving a
late expert designation.  Instead,
Defendant’s late designation resulted from mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect for purposes of Code of Civil Procedure section 2034.720,
subdivision (c)(1). 
In
addition, the Court finds that Plaintiff’s reliance on Defendant’s
delay in serving an expert witness designation was minimal because Defendant’s
counsel served an expert designation on April 16, 2024. 
Defendant’s counsel made Defendant’s expert available for immediate
deposition. For the same reasons, the Court finds that granting Defendant leave to submit a late expert designation will not prejudice Plaintiff in maintaining his action on the merits. 
Therefore,
the Court denies Plaintiff’s motion to strike Defendant’s expert witness designation
and grants Defendant’s motion for leave to submit a tardy expert witness designation. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES Plaintiff Richard Forman’s motion
to strike Defendant City of Los Angeles’s late expert witness designation. 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant City of Los Angeles’s motion for relief from its late
designation of expert witnesses. 
Moving
parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
parties are ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
