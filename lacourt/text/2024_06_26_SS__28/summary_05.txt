Summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a default judgment application filed by Plaintiff Ian Nel against Defendant Danilo Velozo. The Plaintiff is seeking a default judgment of $349,981.58, consisting of $250,000.00 in general damages, $159,400.00 in special damages, $5,334.00 in attorney's fees, and $247.58 in costs. The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's request for a default judgment, citing that the Plaintiff's statement of damages did not provide notice to Velozo of future medical expenses, which the Plaintiff is seeking. The Judge has also denied the Plaintiff's request for attorney's fees, as the Plaintiff has not provided a statutory or contractual basis for the award. The Judge has set an Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal for Failure to Resubmit Default Judgment Packet for August 26, 2024, at 8:30 AM in Department 28 at the Spring Street Courthouse.
