English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is in response to Metcalf Construction Services, LLC's motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff, Elton Spain, filed the action against Metcalf and others for negligence-motor vehicle, negligence per se, and negligent hiring, retention, training, and supervision. The accident occurred on July 27, 2021, when Dalessio, a Metcalf employee, was involved in a car accident while driving his personal vehicle with Plaintiff as a passenger. Metcalf argues that Dalessio was not acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the accident, citing the "going and coming" rule. However, the Court finds that Plaintiff has presented evidence raising a triable issue of fact, including a declaration stating that Metcalf's foreman, Matt Cooley, asked Dalessio to drive Plaintiff back to the hotel, contradicting Metcalf's evidence. Therefore, the Court denies Metcalf's motion for summary judgment.
