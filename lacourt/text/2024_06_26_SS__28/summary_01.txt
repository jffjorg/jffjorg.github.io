And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to compel discovery responses from the defendants. The plaintiff had filed the motion to compel responses to discovery requests on June 3, 2024, but the judge ruled that the motion was untimely and should have been filed by June 11, 2024. The judge notes that the discovery and related dates are based on the June 26, 2024 trial date, and that the motions were filed after the trial date was continued. The judge also references several California Code of Civil Procedure sections, including sections 2031.300 and 2030.290, which govern discovery requests. The judge orders the moving party to give notice of the ruling and to file proof of service of the ruling with the court within five days.
