PARTY’S REQUESTS 
Plaintiff

Gonzalez’s responses to demand for production of documents and things and for
sanctions, and (3) to compel Hernandez Loyo’s responses to special interrogatories

LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Inspection demand 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 provides: 
“If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
following rules shall apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party making the demand may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. 
“(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order compelling
a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in
addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(d) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent
exceptional circumstances, the court shall not impose sanctions on a party or
any attorney of a party for failure to provide electronically stored
information that has been lost, damaged, altered, or overwritten as a result of
the routine, good faith operation of an electronic information system. 
“(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter
any obligation to preserve discoverable information.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300.) 
B.   Interrogatories 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides: 
“If
a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response,
the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may
move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition
of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that
sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290.) 
DISCUSSION 
Non-expert
discovery proceedings “must be ‘completed’ 30 days before the date initially
set for trial [citation].”  (L. Edmon
& C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter
2023) ¶ 8:445, p. 8E-10, emphasis omitted.)  “Discovery motions must be heard no later than
15 days before the date initially set for trial.”  (Ibid.; see Code Civ. Proc., §
2024.020, subd. (a) [“Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, any party
shall be entitled as a matter of right to complete discovery proceedings on or
before the 30th day, and to have motions concerning discovery heard on or
before the 15th day, before the date initially set for the trial of the action”].) 
On
December 20, 2022, the Court scheduled the trial for October 30, 2023.  On October 13, 2023, the Court granted
Plaintiff’s ex parte application to continue the trial and continued the trial
to April 11, 2024.  On April 3, 2024, the
Court granted Defendants’ ex parte application to continue the trial and
continued the trial to June 26, 2024. 
The Court ruled that discovery and related dates would be based on the June 26, 2024 trial date. 
On
June 3, 2024 – after the Court continued the trial to June 26, 2024 – Plaintiff
filed these motions to compel Defendants’ discovery responses, to be heard on
June 26, 2024.  The motions are
untimely.  The last day for the Court to
hear a motion concerning non-expert discovery was June 11, 2024.  The Court denies the motions.
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES Plaintiff Dehkora Tupuola’s motion to
compel Defendant Nazario Lopez Gonzalez’s responses to demand for production of
documents and things and for sanctions. 
The
Court DENIES Plaintiff Dehkora Tupuola’s motion to
compel Defendant Jose L. Davila Antonio’s responses to demand for
production of documents and things and for sanctions. 
The
Court DENIES Plaintiff Dehkora Tupuola’s motion to compel Defendant Haydee Veronica Hernandez Loyo’s responses to special
interrogatories and for sanctions.
