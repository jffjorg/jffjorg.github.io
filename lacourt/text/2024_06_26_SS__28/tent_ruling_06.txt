 Case Number:  23STCV03868    Hearing Date:   June 26, 2024    Dept:  28 On
February 22, 2023, Plaintiffs Rene Mauricio Cardona and Sylvia Susana Cardona filed
this action against Defendants Gianpaul Martinez (“Defendant”) and Does 1-10 for
motor vehicle tort and general negligence. 
On
April 17, 2023, Defendant filed an answer. 
On
September 11, 2023, the Court dismissed Plaintiff Sylvia Cardona with prejudice
at Plaintiffs’ request. 
On
April 18, 2024, Plaintiff Rene Maricio Cardona (“Plaintiff”) filed a motion for
leave to amend complaint to add party, claim, and additional allegations.  The motion was set for hearing on May 15,
2024. The Court continued the hearing to June 26, 2024.  
Plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the complaint does not include a proof of service showing that Plaintiff served the motion on
Defendant.  The Court therefore denies
the motion.
