Moving party requests that the Court compel Defendant FCA
US LLC to produce documents consistent with its responses to requests for

and its attorneys of record in the amount of $2,160.00. 
 
RULING: Plaintiff’s motion to compel compliance
with discovery responses under CCP § 2031.320(a) is granted in part.  
 
SUMMARY OF ACTION 
This action arises from Plaintiff’s purchase of an
allegedly defective 2021 Jeep Compass (the “Subject Vehicle”). On February 28,
2023, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against Defendant FCA US LLC (“Defendant”)
and DOES 1 through 10, inclusive, alleging causes of action for: (1) violation
of the Song-Beverly Act—breach of express warranty and (2) violation of the
Song-Beverly Act—breach of implied warranty. 
 
On April 3, 2023, Defendant filed an Answer to the
Complaint. 
 
On October 6, 2023, Plaintiff filed and served the
instant unopposed motion to compel Defendant to produce documents consistent
with its responses to requests for production of documents and for monetary
sanctions against Defendant and its attorneys of record, Ongaro P.C., in the
amount of $2,160.00.
 
On March 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed and served a notice of
non-opposition as to Plaintiff’s motion to compel.  
 
As of March 11, 2024, Plaintiff’s motion is unopposed.
Any opposition to the motion was required to have been filed and served at
least nine court days prior to the hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd.
(b).) 
 
ANALYSIS
Plaintiff argues that she is entitled to document production
consistent with Defendant’s agreement to comply. Specially, Plaintiff asserts
that she sent requests for production to Defendant, to which Defendant
responded by indicating that it would comply and pointed to several documents
that it would produce. (Mem. P&A at 2:11-12.) Plaintiff indicates that
Defendant has not produced the requested documents or provided any excuse for
its delay. (Mem. P&A at 2:12-13.)  Defendant has not complied with its agreement
to comply with Plaintiff’s RFP Nos. 1-5, 7-12, 14-15, and 33-36. (Notice of
Motion at p. i:8-10.) 
 
Where a request for
production of documents is propounded, the responding party may respond by any
of the following: (1) a statement that the party will comply with the
particular demand; (2) a representation that the party lacks the ability to
comply with the demand of a particular item or category of item; or (3) an
objection to the particular demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.210, subds. (a)(1)-(3).) “A statement that
the party to whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling has
been directed will comply with the particular demand shall state that the
production, inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, and related activity
demanded, will be allowed either in whole or in part, and that all documents or
things in the demanded category that are in the possession, custody, or control
of that party and to which no objection is being made will be included in the
production.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.220.) “If a party filing a response to a
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling . . . fails to permit the
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling in accordance with the party’s
statement of compliance, the demanding party may move for an order compelling
compliance.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.320, subd. (a).) “[T]he court shall
impose a monetary sanction . . . against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel compliance with a demand,
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.320, subd. (b).) A court has discretion to
fix the amount of reasonable monetary sanctions.  (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v.
Summit Healthcare Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771, 791.)
 
Plaintiff’s counsel,
Armando Lopez (“Lopez”), declares that on April 11, 2023, Plaintiff sent
Defendant their first set of requests for production of documents and the
production date for the documents was set for 30 days after service of the
requests. (Lopez Decl., ¶ 3 and Exh. A.) On May 16, 2023, Defendant served
responses and agreed to produce certain documents in response. (Lopez Decl., ¶
4 and Exh. B.) Plaintiff’s counsel attests that Defendant has not responded to
his meet and confer correspondence or produced the requested documents. (Lopez
Decl., ¶¶ 5-6 and Exhs. C and D.) Counsel attests to spending 1.6 hours on the
instant motion and anticipates spending two (2) hours reviewing Defendant’s
opposition and drafting a reply brief. (Lopez Decl., ¶ 7(a)-(b).) Counsel
indicates that he expects to spend an additional two (2) hours preparing for
and attending the hearing on this matter. (Lopez Decl., ¶ 7(c).) Counsel’s
billing rate is $375.00 per hour. (Lopez Decl., ¶ 7.) Counsel states that his
office will be forced to spend $60.00 filing the motion and Plaintiff is
requesting total monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,160.00. (Lopez Decl.,
¶¶ 8-9.)
 
Here, the motion is
unopposed which creates an inference that the motion is meritorious. (Sexton
v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.) Here, Plaintiff has
presented evidence that Defendant agreed to produce responsive documents yet
has failed to produce such documents. 
 
The Court therefore GRANTS
Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant to produce documents consistent with its
responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set One. Within
30 days of the date of notice of this order, Defendant is ORDERED to comply
with its agreement to comply with Plaintiff’s RFP Nos. 1-5, 7-12, 14-15, and
33-36.  
 
As to monetary
sanctions, the Court GRANTS IN PART Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions.
The Court AWARDS Plaintiff reasonable monetary sanctions in the amount of $435.00,
which represents one (1) hour of work on the motion plus the $60.00 filing fee.
The Court reduces the total hours given the lack of opposition to the motion,
its relative brevity, and the straightforward nature of the motion. Monetary
sanctions in the amount of $435.00 are to be paid to Plaintiff by Defendant and
Defendant’s counsel of record, Ongaro P.C., jointly and severally, within 30
days of the date of notice of this order. 
 
Moving party to give notice.
