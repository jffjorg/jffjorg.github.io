            Jury Trial

(1)        OSC re: Entry
of Default
 
            On October
3, 2023, this court issued an OSC re: Entry of Default of (a) Defendant Metal
Supply for failure to answer the Ivry Complaint, (b) Defendant Covington
Business for failure to answer the Ivry Complaint, and (c) Cross-Defendant
Design Tech for failure to answer the HOA’s first Cross-Complaint. The OSC was
set for October 20, 2023.
 
            The OSC was
held on October 20, 2023, as scheduled. Plaintiff Ivry had filed a request for
entry of Metal Supply’s default the morning of the hearing, but it had not been
processed. Plaintiff Ivry had not filed a request for entry of Covington
Business’s default, however, and Cross-Complainant HOA had not filed a request
for entry of Cross-Defendant Design Tech’s default. The OSC was continued to
December 28, 2023.
 
            The clerk’s
office rejected the request for entry of Metal Supply’s default. (Notice of
Rejection filed October 20, 2023). No other requests were filed by any counsel.
 
            The OSC was
held again on December 28, 2023. Counsel for Plaintiff Ivry and
Cross-Complainant HOA assured the court that action would be taken. (Minute Order
of December 28, 2023). The OSC was continued to the instant date.
 
            On January
5, 2024, Plaintiff Ivry again filed a request for entry of Metal Supply’s
default. On January 9, 2024, the clerk’s office rejected the request. No
similar attempt has been made to enter the default of Defendant Covington
Business. And Cross-Complainant HOA has made no similar attempt to enter the
default of Cross-Defendant Design Tech. 
 
            Code of
Civil Procedure §§ 583.410(a) and 583.420(a)(2) and California Rules of
Court Rule 3.1340 vest this court with discretion to dismiss a case for lack of
prosecution if it has not been brought to trial within either two (Section 583.420(a)(2)(B)
and Rule 3.1340) or three (Section 583.420(a)(2)(A)) years.
 
            Defendant
Metal Supply will have been a named defendant in the Ivry Complaint for three
years on February 5, 2024. Defendant Covington Business has been a named
defendant in the Ivry Complaint for well over two years. Cross-Defendant Design
Tech has been a named cross-defendant in the HOA’s first cross-complaint for
over three years. It is time they were either defaulted or dismissed.
 
            The OSC re:
default is CONTINUED to February 8, 2024, at 8:30 am.
 
            The court
also sets an OSC re: dismissal of the Complaint filed on January 10, 2020, against
Defendants Metal Supply, LLC and RJ Covington General Contractor, Inc., as well
as of the Cross-Complaint filed by Defendant HOA on February 19, 2020, as against
Cross-Defendant Design Tech Home Inc. dba Design Tech Construction Services. That
OSC will also be held on February 8, 2024, at 8:30 am.
 
            There will
be no further continuances of either OSC.
 
(2)        OSC re:
Dismissal
 
            On October
3, 2023, this court issued an OSC re: Dismissal of the Ivry Complaint against Defendant
LA DBS, and the HOA’s first Cross-Complaint against Metal Supply and Covington
Business, for failure to timely serve those parties with the relevant pleadings.
The OSC was set for October 20, 2023.
 
            The OSC was
held on October 20, 2023, as scheduled. The HOA had filed a request for
dismissal of Cross-Defendant Covington Business. No other dismissals had been
filed. The OSC was continued to December 28, 2023.
 
            The OSC was
held again on December 28, 2023. Counsel for Plaintiff Ivry had filed a request
for dismissal of Defendant LA DBS. The OSC was continued to the instant date.
 
            As of the
present date, no further requests for dismissal have been filed.
 
            The OSC re:
Dismissal of the Ivry Complaint against Defendant La DBS is now DISCHARGED. The
OSC re: Dismissal of the HOA’s first Cross-Complaint against Cross-Defendant
Covington Business is now DISCHARGED. Both of those parties have been dismissed
from the relevant pleadings.
 
            The
Cross-Complaint filed by Defendant HOA on February 19, 2020, as against Cross-Defendant
Metal Supply, is DISMISSED pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
§ 583.210(a) for failure to timely serve. See Inversiones Papaluchi
S.A.S. v. Superior Court (2018) 20 Cal.App.5th 1055, 1061 (“[i]n
short, a plaintiff has three years from the date of filing the complaint to identify
and serve a Doe defendant”). Cross-Complainant HOA filed its cross-complaint in
the Ivry Case on February 19, 2020. All Cross-Defendants should have been
served by February 19, 2023. But Cross-Complainant HOA has neither served nor
dismissed Cross-Defendant Metal Supply. There is no reason to continue this OSC
any further.
