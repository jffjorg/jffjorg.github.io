And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Guiterrez v. Los Angeles Community College District et al. The plaintiff, Guiterrez, served as Interim Vice Chancellor of Human Resources at the defendant district and alleges that she was given an inappropriate, entry-level salary and was then financially punished when she resisted. The plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) on October 30, 2023, alleging gender and national origin discrimination, retaliation, and labor code violations. The defendant demurred to the entire FAC on the grounds of uncertainty. The judge has granted the defendant's request for judicial notice and overruled the demurrer. The judge finds that the remaining ambiguities in the complaint do not prevent the defendant from responding and should be cleared up through discovery, not further pleading practice. The plaintiff has complied with the court's instructions and produced a pleading to which the defendant can rationally and cleanly respond. The defendant is ordered to answer within 10 days.
