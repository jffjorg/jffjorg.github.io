And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling addresses two OSCs (Orders to Show Cause): one regarding the entry of default and the other regarding the dismissal of the Complaint and Cross-Complaint. The court finds that it is time for Defendants Metal Supply, LLC, Covington Business, and Design Tech to be either defaulted or dismissed. The court sets an OSC re: Entry of Default for February 8, 2024, and an OSC re: Dismissal for the same date.

The court also rules that the Cross-Complaint filed by Defendant HOA on February 19, 2020, as against Cross-Defendant Metal Supply, is dismissed due to failure to timely serve. The court notes that the HOA has not served or dismissed Cross-Defendant Metal Supply, and there is no reason to continue the OSC any further.

The court also discharges the OSC re: Dismissal of the Ivry Complaint against Defendant LA DBS and the HOA's first Cross-Complaint against Covington Business.
