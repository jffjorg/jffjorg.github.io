And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel the deposition of the person most qualified (PMQ) and document production. The motion was filed by Plaintiff Donald Stephenson, who alleges that his 2020 Mercedes-Benz GT63C4S vehicle suffers from certain defects not repaired by Defendant Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC. The court has granted the motion, requiring the presentation of the PMQ for deposition via videoconference, with a pre-provided Zoom link presented by Plaintiff's counsel. The court has also ordered document production on the undisputed categories. The parties are ordered to meet and confer within the next five days to agree upon a mutually convenient deposition date of the PMQ. The court declines to impose sanctions against either party, given the lack of effort to resolve the issue and the lack of a certificate of non-appearance presented by Plaintiff. Trial remains set for January 21, 2025.
