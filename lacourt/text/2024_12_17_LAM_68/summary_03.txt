And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to strike the allegations in support of and claim for punitive damages on grounds of immunity provided by Government Code section 818. The plaintiff opposed the motion, arguing that the operative complaint only seeks damages against individual defendants and that the plaintiff may seek punitive damages against those employees. The judge found that the motion to strike is proper and that the plaintiff offers no dispute to the propriety of the motion regarding immunity of the City of Redondo Beach. The judge granted the motion to strike as to the City of Redondo Beach with prejudice, without leave to amend. The allegations will remain in place as to the individual defendants and are subject to further adjudication in January 2025.
