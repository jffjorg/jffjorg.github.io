SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
April 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed a notice of settlement of the entire case, with
the determination of attorney fees reserved for a hearing.
 
RULING: Granted.
Plaintiff Kye Lee moves for $41,242.97 in attorney
fees and costs, listed as: $29,650 in fees, $1,180.47 in costs a 1.25
multiplier, and $3,000 for the instant motion. Defendant Hyundai Motors
America, Inc. (Hyundai) in opposition challenges the motion on grounds of
excessive attorney fees and lack of any justification for a multiplier.
Plaintiffs in reply acknowledges the lack of any opposition to the entitlement
of fees, and reiterates the reasonableness of all entries as well as
entitlement to a multiplier enhancement.
 
The accepted 998 offer and
settlement agreement specifically delegated determination of statutorily
recoverable fees and costs to the court, thereby entitling Plaintiffs to bring
the subject motion. [Declaration of Alex Cha, Ex. D.] (Engle v. Copenbarger & Copenbarger, LLP (2007)
157 Cal.App.4th 165, 168–169.) Plaintiffs are also presumed prevailing parties
for purposes of statutory recovery. (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 1032, subd. (a)(4); 1033.5, subd. (a)(10)(B); Civ. Code,
§ 1794, subd. (d).) 
 
As a prevailing party, Plaintiffs
are entitled to recover post-offer costs as well. The court finds the
provisions of Code of Civil Procedure section 998 not applicable, as the action
settled rather than going to trial and leading to judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., § 998, subd. (e).)
Nothing in the opposition to the motion otherwise establishes any right to a
fee cut-off subsequent to the time of the offer, due to Defendant obtaining a
better result via judgment. (Scott Co. of California v. Blount, Inc. (1999) 20
Cal.4th 1103, 1114; Duale v. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 718, 726; see Dominguez v. American Suzuki Motor Corp. (2008)
160 Cal.App.4th 53, 60; Ellis
Law Group, LLP v. Nevada City Sugar Loaf Properties, LLC (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 244, 248.)
 
Plaintiff has “the burden of showing that the fees incurred [are]
“’allowable,’ [are] ‘reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation,’
and [are] ‘reasonable in amount.’” (Levy v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. (1992) 4
Cal.App.4th 807, 816; Morris v. Hyundai Motor America (2019) 41
Cal.App.5th 24, 34.) The statute “requires the
trial court to make an initial determination of the actual time expended; and
then to ascertain whether under all the circumstances of the case the amount of
actual time expended and the monetary charge being made for the time expended
are reasonable. These circumstances may include, but are not limited to,
factors such as the complexity of the case and procedural demands, the skill
exhibited and the results achieved. If the time expended or the monetary charge
being made for the time expended are not reasonable under all the
circumstances, then the court must take this into account and award attorney
fees in a lesser amount.” (Nightingale v. Hyundai Motor America (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th
99, 104.) The lodestar method for determination
of fees applies. (Robertson v. Fleetwood Travel Trailers of California, Inc. (2006)
144 Cal.App.4th 785, 819.)
 
“‘[T]he lodestar
is the basic fee for comparable legal services in the community; it may be
adjusted by the court based on factors including, as relevant herein, (1) the
novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in
presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded
other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.
[Citation.] The purpose of such adjustment is to fix a fee at the fair market
value for the particular action. In effect, the court determines,
retrospectively, whether the litigation involved a contingent risk or required
extraordinary legal skill justifying augmentation of the unadorned lodestar in
order to approximate the fair market rate for such services.’” (Graciano v.
Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144
Cal.App.4th 140, 154.)
 
The reasonableness of attorney fees lies within the
discretion of the trial court. (PLCM
Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1096.) The court makes it
determination based on the consideration of a number of factors, including,
“the nature of the litigation, its difficulty, the amount involved, the skill
required in its handling, the skill employed, the attention given, the success
or failure, and other circumstances in the case.” (Ibid.) The court should apply an objective standard of
reasonableness. (Id. at p. 1098.) “A
fee request that appears unreasonably inflated is a special circumstance
permitting the trial court to reduce the award or deny one altogether.” (Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d
621, 635.) The court adheres to the “market
rate” approach for contingency cases, and finds the “Laffey” charts general and
only suggestive. (Pasternack v. McCullough (2021) 65 Cal.App.5th 1050, 1057; Center for Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino (2010)
188 Cal.App.4th 603, 619-620.)
 
Counsel
lists billable rates of $350/hour for attorney Sena Hori and $550/hour for Alex
Cha. Counsel identifies a total of 69 hours—Hori for 41.5 hours billed; Cha for
27.5 hours. The $3,000 request for the subject motion is listed in the
declaration as an entry by Cha for four hours. The remaining amount to bring
the total to $3,000 falls under the costs for the reply and appearance.
Plaintiff seeks a 1.25 times multiplier applied to the $29,650 base for an
additional $7,412.50, as well as $1,180.47 in identified costs. 
 
Hyundai in opposition, while not disputing the right to recovery,
offers no suggested reasonable counter amount, and instead challenges the
reasonableness of specific entries, and denial of any multiplier enhancement,
given the “simple” and “routine” nature of the action and experience of
counsel. Hyundai also challenges the range of hourly rates, and asserts that
associate Hori in fact works for Wood Smith Henning & Berman, LLP, a
firm not identifying lemon law as a specialty practice of the firm, thereby diminishing
the recoverable rate. Hyundai also takes issue with Cha only listing lemon law
practice for two years, thereby also lowering any reasonable rate to “no more
than $300 per hour” for such work. The suggested rate is commensurate with
contract defense work billing at $200-$250/hour.
 
The
subject action was presumably taken on a contingency basis, with statutory
recovery an assumed condition for recovery of any fee. Song-Beverly litigation
constitutes a specialty, due to the extensive statutory guidelines and
technical requirements in analyzing a vehicle. The court declines to consider
any purported relationship between Hori and Wood Smith Henning & Berman,
LLP. A failure to either update notice of employment or otherwise somehow
jointly work with a law firm in no way even ostensibly associated with the
subject action will not undermine the determination of the reasonableness of
the hourly rate or total recovery. Given the nature of contingency work
relative to defense billing, the court also declines to compare reasonableness
of rates on this basis. The court also finds that while Cha may have only
identified lemon law as a specialty more recently, Cha still presents as an
experienced lawyer well within the rate for a consumer advocate litigator in
Los Angeles County. the court finds the billing rates represent a reasonable range
for the market and practice area. (Mikhaeilpoor
v. BMW of North America, LLC (2020) 48
Cal.App.5th 240, 247, 256; Center for Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino,
supra, 188 Cal.App.4th at pp. 619-620; see Lindy Bros. Builders, Inc. of Phila. v. American Radiator &
Standard Sanitary Corp. (3d Cir. 1973) 487 F.2d 161, 167.) 
 
The court
next considers the listed entries. “In referring
to ‘reasonable’
compensation, we indicated that trial courts must carefully review attorney
documentation of hours expended; ‘padding’ in the form of inefficient or
duplicative efforts is not subject to compensation.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001)
24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132; Levy v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc., supra, 4 Cal.App.4th at p. 817.) The
court considers the individual contributions of each attorney rather engage in
a categorical determination of entitlement. (Morris
v. Hyundai Motor America (2019) 41
Cal.App.5th 24, 40; Mountjoy v. Bank of America, N.A. (2016) 245
Cal.App.4th 266, 280-281; Christian Research Institute v. Alnor, (2008) 165
Cal.App.4th 1315, 1329.) 
 
The court
finds no documented examples of unrelated work leading to the settlement, but certain
items appear as redundant billing items. (Donahue v. Donahue (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 259,
271.) Hyundai addresses a number of entries as to the necessity and efficiency,
while Plaintiff in reply emphasizes the reasonableness of its billing,
including block billing. Overall, the court finds certain entries excessive,
particularly in the complaint and discovery related work. 
 
The
tersely worded complaint reflects a consistent pro forma style for Song-Beverly
Act litigation. While counsel perhaps spent time researching the vehicle,
nothing in the subject complaint reflects four hours of work. The court deducts
three (3) of the four (4) hours from the October 31, 2022, entry thereby
leaving one hour at the $350/hour rate.
 
On the
discovery motions, the six hours spent drafting discovery requests on November
22, 2022, one and one half hours reviewing responses on December 7 and February
24, 2023 (total of three hours), additional review on February 27, 2023 and
April 4, 2023, review of verifications and research on motions on April 10,
2023, six hours drafting four motions to compel initial responses on April 12,
2023, review of the motions and drafting of replies on June 12 and 16, 2023,
and attend the hearing on June 26, 2023 (whereby the court awarded $1,000 in
sanctions), are excessive, and seek to recover an improper windfall. The court
determined compensation for the exact same items in the form of sanctions at
the time of the hearing. The court strikes these entries in their entirety
given both the excessive amount of hours listed, and the prior award reflecting
compensation for the items. Any award for recovery of additional fees on the
subject discovery items constitutes an improper double recovery.
 
On the
July 11, 2023, the court finds the reviews of document production by both
attorneys for a total 4.5 hours improperly redundant. Nothing in the
declaration establishes completely separate and discrete items, or the
necessity of two attorneys to review presumably at least some of the same
items. The court reduces the entry by two and one half hours for a total
recovery of two hours on this date. The court awards one hour each at the $350
and $550 hourly rates.
 
The two
and one half hours for the PMK deposition motion on January 8, 2024, when read
in context with the entries regarding the PMK deposition beginning on September
27, 2023, is excessive and unnecessary. The court docket shows no filed motion.
Furthermore, the court stayed the case on March 28, 2024, and the case settled
before any motion was considered. [Declaration of Donna Hopper.] The court
strikes all entries, with the exception of the 12-7-24 entry for settlement
discussion with client by Cha.
 
Finally,
the five and one half hours spent reviewing the arbitration motion by both
attorneys on March 27 and 28, 2024, is redundant and therefore excessive. The
court reduces the total to two and one half hours with an even split at the
respective rates.
 
On the
discovery motions, the court therefore deducts 23.4 hours for Hori ($8,190),
and 9.5 hours for Cha ($5,225). The reduced and adjusted costs on the
complaint, document review, and arbitration/stay motion amount to $2,375. The deducted
amounts render a remainder of the fee for $13,297.50 ($4,497.50 Hori  + $8,800 Cha), plus $3,000 for the instant
motion for a total of $16,297.50.
 
The court declines to award a
multiplier on the subject action. “The lodestar
amount is presumptively the reasonable fee amount, and thus a multiplier may be
used to adjust the lodestar amount upward or downward only in “ ‘rare’ and
‘exceptional’ cases, supported by both ‘specific evidence’ on the record and
detailed findings by the lower courts” that the lodestar amount is unreasonably
low or unreasonably high.” (Van Gerwen v. Guarantee Mut. Life Co. (9th Cir.
2000) 214 F.3d 1041, 1045.) The court finds the lodestar determination
sufficiently addresses the fee. Nothing in the litigation over the subject
vehicle which led to a pre-trial settlement demonstrates a rare or exceptional
case showing a significant benefit beyond reimbursement for the vehicle and
lost time, as well as a fee reflecting the assumed contingency nature of the
representation. (Blum v. Stenson (1984) 465 U.S. 886, 901; Hensley v. Eckerhart (1983)
461 U.S. 424, 434; see Thayer v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2001) 92
Cal.App.4th 819, 844.)
 
On costs, the
court appreciates the argument from Hyundai regarding the lack of a memorandum
of costs, but the declaration clearly articulates each and every item. The
court finds no improperly listed items. The items appear reasonable, especially
given the fixed fees for court costs, without or without documentation. The
service of process fees in no way appears excessive. The court awards all
costs.
 
The court therefore awards $16,297.50
in attorney fees plus $11,180.47 in costs for a total recovery of $17,477.97.
 
Because the amount of fees exceeds $5,000, the order is
immediately appealable. (Code Civ. Proc., 904.1, subd. (a)(12); Doe v. Luster (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th
139, 146.)
