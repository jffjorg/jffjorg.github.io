On
June 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint for 1. Discrimination
Based On Physical Disability (Govt. Code §12940(A)); 2. Hostile Work
Environment (Govt. Code §12940 Et Seq.); 3. Retaliation In Violation Of Govt.
Code §12940 Et Seq.; 4. Failure To Prevent Discrimination (Govt. Code
§12940(K)); 5. Harassment (Govt. Code §12940(J); 6. Failure To Accommodate
Physical Disability In Violation Of Govt. Code §12940(M); 7. Failure To Engage
In A Good Faith Interactive Process In Violation Of Govt. Code §12940(N); and
8. Defamation.
 
On
August 22, 2024, the court denied the special motion to strike the first
amended complaint brought by City of Redondo Beach. On November 7, 2024,
Plaintiff dismissed “Redondo Beach Police Department” without prejudice.
 
RULING: Granted.
Defendant
City of Redondo Beach moves to strike the allegations in support of, and claim
for, punitive damages on grounds of immunity provided by Government Code
section 818. Plaintiff in opposition maintains the operative complaint only
seeks damages against the individual defendants, and Plaintiff may seek
punitive damages against said employees. Plaintiff also challenges the
propriety of the motion seeking to strike the supporting allegations. Defendant
in reply reiterates the necessity of dismissing the improper punitive damages
claim.
 
The
motion to strike both the allegations in support of, and claim for punitive
damages is proper. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436.) Plaintiff offers no dispute to the
propriety of the motion regarding immunity of the City of Redondo Beach. “Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a
public entity is not liable for damages awarded under Section 3294 of the Civil
Code or other damages imposed primarily for the sake of example and by way of
punishing the defendant.” (Gov. Code, § 818.)
 
The notice of motion is
brought only by City of Redondo Beach. The individual defendants are not
identified as moving parties in the subject motion. The individual defendants
in fact have separately scheduled demurrers without motions to strike on calendar
for January 6, 8 and 23, 2025, respectively. The court therefore grants the
motion to strike as to City of Redondo Beach with prejudice/without leave to
amend. Though the first amended complaint names City of Redondo Beach in all
identified paragraphs and the prayer for relief, the allegations will remain in
place as to the individual defendants and therefore subject to further
adjudication in January 2025. The order only applies to City of Redondo Beach.
 
Next
demurrer scheduled for January 6, 2025.
 
Defendants
