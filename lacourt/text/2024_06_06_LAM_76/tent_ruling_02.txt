[1]  A demurrer does not lie to only part of a cause of action or a
particular type of damage or remedy. (See
Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redevelopment Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th
1028, 1046; PH II, Inc. v. Superior Court
(Ibershof) (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1680, 1682.)  The proper procedure is to bring a motion to
strike the substantively defective allegation. 
(Id. at 1682-83.)
