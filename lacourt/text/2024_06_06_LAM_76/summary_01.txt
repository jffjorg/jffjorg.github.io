And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 24STCV01844. The defendant, North American Security and Investigations, Inc., demurred to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint alleging retaliation in violation of Labor Code § 1102.5. The judge has ruled that the demurrer to the fifth cause of action is overruled. The plaintiff's allegations of retaliation are based on a series of retaliatory conduct that occurred before his employment was terminated, including after he complained to Human Resources. The plaintiff filed a complaint with the EEOC and received a Right-to-Sue letter, which justified the application of the equitable tolling doctrine. The court finds that the plaintiff's EEOC complaint was filed within the statutory period, and that the EEOC claim alerted the defendant to the need to investigate the underlying facts. The court further finds that the plaintiff's filing of the Complaint in this action was reasonable and in good faith. As such, the demurrer to the fifth cause of action is overruled, and the defendant is ordered to answer the First Amended Complaint within 10 days.
