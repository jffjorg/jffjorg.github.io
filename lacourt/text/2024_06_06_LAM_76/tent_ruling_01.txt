ANALYSIS
Demurrer To First
Amended Complaint
Meet and Confer
            The Declaration of Kimberly A.
Westmoreland reflects that Defendant’s counsel satisfied the meet and confer
requirement set forth in Civ. Proc. Code, § 430.41.
Discussion
Defendant North American Security
and Investigations, Inc. demurs to the First Amended Complaint.
1.         Fifth
Cause of Action (Retaliation in Violation of Labor Code, § 1102.5).
            Labor Code
§ 1102.5(b) prohibits an employer from retaliating against an employee for
disclosing information to a person with authority over the employee or another
employee who has the authority to investigate, discovery or correct the
violation of noncompliance of a state or federal statute, rule or regulation.
            Defendant
argues that this cause of action is time-barred by the three-year of statute of
limitations set forth in Civ. Proc. Code, § 338(a), because Plaintiff alleges
that his employment ended on October 29, 2020, yet he did not file his
Complaint in this action until January 24, 2024.
            Plaintiff
argues that the statute of limitations was tolled during the time that
Plaintiff’s charge with the EEOC was pending until Plaintiff received a
Right-To-Sue letter from the EEOC.
            The Court
finds Plaintiff’s argument to be persuasive.
Equitable tolling allows a plaintiff who has a choice of
legal remedies to pursue one remedy without simultaneously pursuing another
remedy. (McDonald v. Antelope Valley Community College Dist. (2008) 45
Cal.4th 88, 99–100 [84 Cal. Rptr. 3d 734, 194 P.3d 1026] (McDonald); California
Restaurant Management Systems v. City of San Diego (2011) 195 Cal.App.4th
1581, 1593–1594 [126 Cal. Rptr. 3d 160].) The doctrine relieves the plaintiff
claiming employment discrimination from the hardship of pursuing duplicate and
possibly unnecessary procedures to enforce the same rights or obtain the same
relief. (Downs v. Department of Water & Power (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th
1093, 1100 [68 Cal. Rptr. 2d 590].)
The equitable tolling doctrine generally requires a
showing that the plaintiff is seeking an alternate remedy in an established
procedural context. (See McDonald, supra, 45 Cal.4th at pp. 102–104;
Schifando v. City of Los Angeles, supra, 31 Cal.4th at p. 1082.)
Informal negotiations or discussions between an employer and employee do not
toll a statute of limitations under the equitable tolling doctrine. (See 65
Butterfield v. Chicago Title Ins. Co. (1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 1047, 1063 [83
Cal. Rptr. 2d 40].) Acuna does not allege any facts showing she was pursuing an
alternate remedy that excused her from timely filing her administrative claim
and/or from filing her lawsuit.
 [*1417] 
Moreover, the equitable tolling doctrine is
inapplicable once the employee is on notice that his or her rights had been
violated and that her alternate remedies will be unsuccessful. (Richards,
supra, 26 Cal.4th at p. 814.) As discussed above, Acuna acknowledged that
by February 2007 she understood that SDG&E was refusing to
accommodate her disability and was not interested in informally resolving her
claims.
(Acuna v. San Diego Gas &
Electric Co. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 1402, 1416-17 [bold emphasis added].)
 
“As the name suggests, equitable estoppel is an
equitable issue for court resolution.” (Hoopes v. Dolan, supra, 168
Cal.App.4th at p. 161; see C & K Engineering Contractors, supra, 23
Cal.3d at p. 9 [“equitable estoppel may be tried by the court without a
jury”].)
. . .  [*746] . . .
 “The equitable tolling of statutes of
limitations is a judicially created, nonstatutory doctrine. [Citations.] It is
‘designed to prevent unjust and technical forfeitures of the right to a trial
on the merits when the purpose of the statute
of limitations—timely notice to the defendant of the plaintiff's
claims—has been satisfied.’ [Citation.] Where applicable, the doctrine will
‘suspend or extend a statute of
limitations as necessary to ensure fundamental practicality and
fairness.’ [Citation.]” (McDonald, supra, 45 Cal.4th at p. 99.)
In Elkins v. Derby (1974) 12 Cal.3d 410, 414 [115
Cal.Rptr. 641, 525 P.2d 81] (Elkins), the Supreme Court held that the
doctrine of equitable tolling may apply to toll the statute of limitations on a
claim during the period in which a plaintiff pursues another remedy for the
harm that the plaintiff suffered. The Elkins court adopted a line
of cases in which courts had concluded that “if the defendant is not prejudiced
thereby, the running of the limitations period is tolled ‘[w]hen an injured
person has several legal remedies and, reasonably and in good faith,
pursues one.’” (Id. at p. 414, quoting Myers v. County of Orange
(1970) 6 Cal.App.3d 626, 634 [86 Cal.Rptr. 198] (Myers).)
. . . [*747]  . . .
The Elkins court reasoned that the primary
purpose of a limitations statute is to “‘(prevent) surprises through the
revival of claims that have been allowed to slumber until evidence has been
lost, memories have faded, and witnesses have disappeared.’” (Elkins,
supra, 12 Cal.3d at p. 417, quoting Telegraphers v. Ry. Express Agency
(1944) 321 U.S. 342, 348–349 [88 L.Ed. 788, 64 S.Ct. 582].) According to the
Elkins court, that purpose is “normally satisfied when the defendant
receives timely notification of the first of two proceedings.” (Elkins,
supra, at p. 416, fn. 3.)
In the wake of Elkins, the California Supreme
Court has stated that in order to prove the applicability of the equitable
tolling doctrine, a party must establish “three elements: ‘timely notice, and
lack of prejudice, to the defendant, and reasonable and good faith conduct on
the part of the plaintiff.’ [Citations.]” (McDonald, supra, 45
Cal.4th at p. 102.) “‘“The timely notice requirement essentially means that
the first claim must have been filed within the statutory period. Furthermore[,]
the filing of the first claim must alert the defendant in the second claim of
the need to begin investigating the facts which form the basis for the second
claim. Generally this means that the defendant in the first claim is the
same one being sued in the second.” [Citation.] “The second prerequisite
essentially translates to a requirement that the facts of the two claims be
identical or at least so similar that the defendant's investigation of the
first claim will put him in a position to fairly defend the second.” [Citation.]
“The third prerequisite of good faith and reasonable conduct on the part of
the plaintiff is less clearly defined in the cases. But in Addison v.
State of California [(1978)] 21 Cal.3d 313 [146 Cal.Rptr. 224, 578 P.2d
941][,] the Supreme Court did stress
that the plaintiff filed his second claim a short time after tolling ended.” [Citation.]’
[Citation.]” (McDonald, supra, at p. 102, fn. 2.)
(Hopkins v. Kedzierski
(2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 736, 745-47 [bold emphasis added].)
            Here, at
least a part of Plaintiff’s Labor Code, § 1102.5 whistleblower claim is based
on a series of retaliatory conduct which occurred before he was terminated[1],
including immediately after he complained to Human Resources on August 27, 2019.
(See 1AC, ¶¶ 11 -  24.) Plaintiff
alleges that on July 15, 2020, he filed with complaint with the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission concerning the statement Lieutenant Figueroa
made and the repeated issues of unsubstantiated reprimands in retaliation for
making a complaint. (1AC, ¶ 25.) Plaintiff was terminated on October 29, 2020,
but negotiated to have is position reinstated. (Id. at ¶ 32.)
            Plaintiff
alleges that after the EEOC attempted reconciliation for three and one-half
years, the parties were unable to come to an agreement and Plaintiff received a
Right-to-Sue letter on December 5, 2023, against North American. (1AC, ¶ 40;
Exh. A.) Plaintiff filed his Complaint in this action on January 24, 2024.
            The
foregoing facts pled in the 1AC are sufficient to satisfy the elements of
timely notice, lack of prejudice to defendant, and reasonable and good faith
conduct on the part of the plaintiff. Plaintiff’s EEOC complaint was filed
within the statutory period, the EEOC claim alerted defendant of the need to
investigate underlying facts, and Plaintiff filed this Complaint a little less
than 2 months after receiving the right-to-sue letter from the EEOC.
            Courts have
found that filing a complaint with the EEOC justifies application of the
equitable tolling doctrine in the context of a FEHA claim.  (Mitchell
v. State Dept. of Public Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1010.)
            In that the
application of equitable tolling of the statute of limitations is a question
for the Court, the Court finds there are sufficient facts pled to justify
application of the equitable tolling doctrine at this stage of the pleadings.
            As such,
the demurrer to the fifth cause of action is OVERRULED. Defendant is ordered to
answer the First Amended Complaint within 10 days.
