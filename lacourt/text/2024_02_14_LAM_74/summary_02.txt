And here is the English-text summary:

In this tentative ruling, Judge Sonya Howard considers the defendants' motion to dismiss the plaintiff's breach of contract complaint. The defendants argue that the court should dismiss the action under Code of Civil Procedure section 581, subdivision (f)(2), as the plaintiff failed to amend their complaint after the court sustained the defendants' demurrer with leave to amend. The court finds that the plaintiff never amended their complaint within the allowed time and therefore grants the defendants' motion to dismiss with prejudice. The court cites relevant case law, including Otworth v. Southern Pac. Transportation Co. (1985) and Cono v. Glover (2006), to support its decision.
