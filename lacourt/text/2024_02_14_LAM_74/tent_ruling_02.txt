 Case Number:  23STCV04761    Hearing Date:   February 14, 2024    Dept:  74 Sonya Howard
v. Norma Serena, et al.
Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss
The
court considered the moving papers. No opposition was timely filed. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1005, subd. (b) [“All papers opposing a motion […] shall be field with
the court and a copy served on each party at least nine court days […] before
the hearing.”].) 
BACKGROUND 
            On March 2, 2023, Plaintiff Sonya
Howard (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against Defendants Norma Serena and HACLA
Housing Authority of Los Angeles, California (Defendants). The complaint
alleges breach of contract.
            On November 1, 2023, the court
sustained Defendants’ demurrer to the complaint with leave to amend.
            On December 7, 2023, Defendants
filed this motion to dismiss.
DISCUSSION
            Defendants seek dismissal of this
action under Code of Civil Procedure section 581, subdivision (f)(2): “The court
may dismiss the complaint […] when […] after a demurrer to the complaint is
sustained with leave to amend, the plaintiff fails to amend it within the time
allowed by the court and either party moves for dismissal.” Here, the court
sustained Defendants’ demurrer to Plaintiff’s complaint with leave to amend on
November 1, 2023. Moreover, the court allowed Plaintiff to amend her complaint
within 30 days of its order. But Plaintiff never did so. Thus, the court has
grounds to dismiss this action. (Otworth v. Southern Pac. Transportation Co.
(1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 452, 457 [“When a plaintiff elects not to amend the
complaint, it is presumed that the complaint states as strong a case as
possible; and the judgment of dismissal must be affirmed if the unamended
complaint is objectionable on any ground raised in the demurrer.”].) 
CONCLUSION 
The
court grants Defendants’ motion to dismiss with prejudice. (Cono v. Glover
(2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 326, 329.) 
Defendants shall give
notice.
