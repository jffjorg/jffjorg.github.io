  Case Number:  20STCV09612    Hearing Date:   February 14, 2024    Dept:  74 Glenn Feldman, et al. v. Fraser Ross, et al.
 
Defendants’ Motion to Quash or Modify Deposition Notice and Subpoena to
Custodian of Records of Khan & Associates 
 
BACKGROUND 
            This action arises from
a contractual dispute.
            On March 9, 2020,
Plaintiff Glenn Feldman (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against Defendants Fraser
Ross, Kitross Apparel Los Angeles, and Christopher Lee (Defendants). In the
complaint, Plaintiff alleges the following causes of action: intentional
misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty,
breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, constructive trust,
accounting, and fraudulent conversion.
            On July 25, 2023,
Plaintiff claims he issued a deposition notice and subpoena to Third-Party Khan
& Associates (Third-Party), who is Defendants’ accountant.
            On August 14, 2023,
Defendants and Third-Party filed this motion to quash the deposition notice and
subpoena to Third-Party under reservation number 315316257871. The motion lists
February 24, 2024, as the hearing date. But on August 15, 2023, Defendants and
Third-Party filed a notice of errata indicating that February 14, 2024, is the
correct hearing date.
            On November 1, 2023, Plaintiff filed an opposition to the motion, which
identifies the reservation number as 315316257871 and the hearing date as
November 15, 2023.
            On November 7, 2023,
Defendants and Third-Party filed a reply, which identifies the reservation
number as 315316257871 and the hearing date as November 15, 2023.
            On November 14, 2023,
the court continued the November 15 hearing to December 4, 2023.
            On December 4, 2023, the
court denied the motion to quash.
DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION
            This motion is moot because the court already denied it on December 4,
2023.
Defendants shall give notice.
