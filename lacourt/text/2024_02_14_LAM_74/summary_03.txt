Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrer filed by the defendant and has overruled the demurrer for the fourth and fifth causes of action, namely intentional infliction of emotional distress and private nuisance. The court finds that the plaintiff's allegations of extreme and outrageous behavior and reckless disregard of the probability of causing emotional distress are sufficient to state a cause of action. The court also finds that the defendant's intentional failure to repair and exterminate the premises created a private nuisance.

The court has also reviewed the motion to strike filed by the defendant, which seeks to remove references to punitive damages from the complaint. The court denies the motion to strike in its entirety. The court finds that the plaintiff's allegations of malice, oppression, and fraud are sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages and that the defendant's failure to repair and exterminate the premises was done with a conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.
