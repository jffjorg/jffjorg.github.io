ROULA ELKON, AN INDIVIDUAL vs YEGHISHEH MIRZOYAN, D.D.S.
 
[Tentative]
Ruling on Motion to Compel Further Discovery Responses:
The motions
to compel further responses to special and form interrogatories have been taken
off calendar.  The only remaining motion
is as to the Request for Production of Documents.  After reviewing the supplemental responses,
the court orders a verified further response and production to RFP # 6 only
within 15 days.  Plaintiff fails to state
whether the responsive document(s) “does not exist” because they never existed,
destroyed, lost, misplaced, or stolen or whether the item has never been or is
no longer in Plaintiff's custody or control, and whether they are in the
possession of a person or entity, and to identity that person or entity.
Monetary
sanctions are awarded against plaintiff’s counsel HG LAW, APC and plaintiff
Roula Elkon, jointly and severally, in the sum of $1,200 per CCP section
2023.010, discovery abuse without substantial justification, payable to the
Client Trust Account of Lawrence Rosenzweig APC, 1990 S. Bundy Drive, Suite
777, Los Angeles, CA 90025 by 12/15/2023. 
No sanctions against Ms. Boyajian because since she associated into the
case after the motion was filed, she has made reasonable efforts to resolve the
discovery disputes.
