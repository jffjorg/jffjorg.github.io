 Case Number:  23VECV01030    Hearing Date:   November 15, 2023    Dept:  T 23VECV01030 SHELLY HART vs LASALLE PROPERTY FUND REIT,
INC.
Tentative ruling: Ex Parte Application By LPF Triana For "Leave
To Amend Verified Answer And Reject Request For Entry Of Default"
Pursuant to CRC 3.1204(b)(1), the declaration of notice
fails to state whether there was any response to the notice, although the court notes
it has received and reviewed plaintiff's opposition and amended opposition to the ex parte application.  
Default has already been entered as to defendant
"LaSalle Property Fund Reit, Inc. dba LPF Triana, Inc., a
corporation."  There is no affirmative factual showing in a
declaration containing competent testimony based on personal knowledge of
irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for granting
relief ex parte. 
Therefore, the ex parte application to "For Leave To
Amend Verified Answer And Reject Request For Entry Of Default" is denied
without prejudice to filing a noticed motion.
