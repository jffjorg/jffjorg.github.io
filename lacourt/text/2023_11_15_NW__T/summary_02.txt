```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's ex parte application to amend their verified answer and reject the request for entry of default, without prejudice to filing a noticed motion. The application was denied because there was no affirmative factual showing of irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for granting relief ex parte. The plaintiff had opposed the application, and default had already been entered against the defendant. The judge noted that they had received and reviewed the plaintiff's opposition and amended opposition, but the declaration of notice failed to state whether there was any response to the notice.
