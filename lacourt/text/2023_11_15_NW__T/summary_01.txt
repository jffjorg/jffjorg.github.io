And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel further discovery responses. The motion to compel further responses to special and form interrogatories has been taken off calendar, leaving only the request for production of documents. The judge orders the plaintiff to provide a verified further response and production to RFP # 6 only within 15 days. The plaintiff is also required to state whether the responsive document(s) "does not exist" due to destruction, loss, or theft, or whether the item is in the custody or control of a person or entity. Monetary sanctions of $1,200 are awarded against the plaintiff's counsel HG LAW, APC and plaintiff ROULA ELKON, jointly and severally, for discovery abuse without substantial justification. The sanctions are payable to the Client Trust Account of Lawrence Rosenzweig APC by December 15, 2023. No sanctions are awarded against Ms. Boyajian, who associated into the case after the motion was filed and made reasonable efforts to resolve the discovery disputes.
