ALLEGATIONS:  
Yuqin Liu
(“Plaintiff”) brings this action against Beverly
Hills New Life Medical Group, LLC (“Defendant”). Plaintiff alleges that
Defendant negligently administered derma filler injections which resulted in
personal injury. 
Before the Court are two
motions brought by Defendant. Defendant moves to compel further responses to its
Form Interrogatories Set One and Special Interrogatories Set One. Plaintiff has filed no opposition to these motions. 
ANALYSIS:  
I.               
LEGAL
STANDARD  
On
receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an
order compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that the
responses contain: (1) answers that are evasive or incomplete, (2)¿an
unwarranted or insufficiently specific exercise of an option to produce
documents in lieu of a substantive response, or (3) unmerited or overly
generalized objections.  (C.C.P.
§¿2030.300(a).) The responding party has the burden of justifying the
objections thereto. (Coy v. Sup.Ct. (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220-21.) 
II.             
MERITS 
Defendant moves to compel
Plaintiff’s further response to its Form
Interrogatories Set One and Special Interrogatories Set One. Upon review, the Court finds the meet and
confer efforts sufficient. (Palin Decl. ¶ 13, Exh. 3.) 
Defendant propounded its interrogatories
on Plaintiff on August 7, 2023. (Palin Decl. ¶ 2.) Plaintiff thereafter
requested, and Defendant’s counsel granted, an extension to reply to September 15,
2023. (Plain Decl. ¶ 5.) Further extension was requested to allow
Plaintiff’s new counsel, Peter Deng (“Deng”), to appear in the matter. (Palin Decl.
¶ 6.) Defendant emailed all outstanding discovery requests to Deng on September
16, 2023 and emailed a reminder that responses were due on September 29, 2023.
(Palin Decl. ¶¶ 7-8.) Having received no responses, Defendant filed a
motion to compel scheduled to be heard November 16, 2023. (Palin Decl.
¶ 11.) Plaintiff served her responses to both Form and Special
Interrogatories on October 23, 2023. (Palin Decl. ¶ 12.) 
Defendant contends that Plaintiff’s
responses to both interrogatories contain improper objections. Defendant argues
that, per C.C.P. § 2030.290 (a), Plaintiff waived objections by failure to
render timely responses. Accordingly, Defendant argues Plaintiff’s objections
to various Form and Special Interrogatories are improper. (See Form
Interrogatory Nos. 2.3-2.8, 2.13-2.14, 6.2, 7.1-7.3, 11.1-12.7; Special
Interrogatory Nos. 3-50.) 
Defendant further argues
that several of the Form Interrogatory responses are incomplete because Plaintiff
has failed to fully identify where she lived in contravention of her deposition
testimony. (Palin Decl. ¶ 15.) Defendant also states that many of the responses
contain nonsensical responses referencing a slip and fall accident which is not
the subject of this case. (See Form Interrogatory Nos. 6.3, 12.1, 20.1) Further,
while Plaintiff’s response to Form Interrogatories Nos. 6.2, 6.4-6.7, and 12.6
state Plaintiff’s medical records are attached as Exhibit 1, no such records
were attached. (Palin Decl. Exh. 2.) Similarly, Plaintiff references Exhibit 2
in her response to Form Interrogatory No. 12.4 but no such exhibit was
attached. (Palin Decl. Exh. 2.) 
The Court notes that
Plaintiff has filed no opposition to this motion. A failure to oppose a motion
may be deemed a consent to the granting of the motion. (C.R.C. Rule 8.54(c).)
Further, on a motion to compel further response Plaintiff has the burden to
justify her objections thereto. Here, Plaintiff has failed to oppose this
motion and failed to justify her objections. 
Given the foregoing,
Defendant’s unopposed motions to compel further responses to its Form
Interrogatories Set One and Special Interrogatories Set One are GRANTED. 
Sanctions 
As concerns motions to
compel, the law only requires sanctions in the event that a party
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further responses. (C.C.P. §
2033.290(d), C.C.P. §¿2030.300(d).) As such, any monetary sanctions granted are
within the discretionary power of the Court as per C.C.P. § 2030.290. As per
C.C.P. § 2023.010(d), failure to respond constitutes a misuse of the discovery
process. Additionally, it is customary to grant sanctions where a party has
filed a motion to compel, and the other party fails to file an opposition.
(C.R.C. Rule 3.1348(a).)  
Here, Defendant has filed two
motions to compel further responses, neither of which were opposed by
Plaintiff. Given the relative simplicity of the motions and their similar
nature, the Court considers sanctions collectively rather than with respect to
each motion. 
The Court awards sanctions in
the amount of $859. This amount reflects 3.4 hours of attorney work at a rate
of $235 per hour, plus the $60 filing fee. (Mantovani Decl. ¶¶ 2-4.)  This amount does not include the anticipated
time in reviewing the opposition and replying, as each motion was unopposed.
This amount also does not include the $15 LA CourtConnect fee as Defendant’s
counsel is not obligated to appear remotely.---
 
RULING: 
In the
event the parties submit on this tentative ruling, or a party requests a signed
order or the court in its discretion elects to sign a formal order, the
following form will be either electronically signed or signed in hard copy and
entered into the court’s records.
