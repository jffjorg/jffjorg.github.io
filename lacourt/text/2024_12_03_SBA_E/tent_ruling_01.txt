            The Court
grants the Motion for Summary Judgment.
 
BACKGROUND
 
            On
November 8, 2024, Plaintiff Susan
Josepher filed the Complaint against Defendant
Trader Joe’s Company, alleging causes of action for general negligence, premises
liability, and willful failure to warn arising out of an alleged trip and fall
incident.
 
            On September 10, 2024, Defendant
filed the instant Motion for Summary Judgment.
 
            On November 22, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the Opposition.
 
            On November 27, 2024, Defendant
filed the Reply.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
            The function of a
motion for summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to
whether an opposing party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or
claim and to enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil
Procedure section 437 subdivision (c) “requires the trial judge to grant
summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably
deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or
evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of
the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the
issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether
there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the
pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67,
citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367,
381-382.)  
 
As to each cause of action, as framed by the
complaint, the defendant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication
must satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to show “that one
or more elements of the cause of action ... cannot be established, or that
there is a complete defense to the cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
437c(p)(2); see also Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of
the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence
in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39
Cal.4th 384, 389.)  
 
Once the defendant has met that burden, the
burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more
material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto. To
establish a triable issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must
produce substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)  
 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
This case involves a trip and fall incident
that occurred on February 22, 2022, when Plaintiff tripped over an all-black
wheel stop in the parking lot of a shopping center located at 1761 S. Elena
Avenue, Redondo Beach, California.  At
the time of the incident, Defendant Riviera Place, LLC owned the parking lot
and shopping center, where Defendant Trader Joe's was one of the tenants.
 
Timeliness
 
All opposition
papers must be served on the moving party and filed with the court at least
fourteen days before the hearing. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c sudb. (b)(2).) Here, Plaintiff's opposition was filed on November
22. Therefore, the Opposition was late. 
Defendant asks the Court to disregard the Opposition as untimely. The
Court rejects this request and exercises its discretion to review all submitted
papers. (Iverson v. Superior Court, (1985) 167 Cal. App. 3d 544, 546.)
 
 
Causes
of action 1 and 2 - Negligence and Premises Liability 
 
Defendant
argues that they are entitled to summary judgment for both causes of action
because Defendant did not own, control, or maintain the premises where
Plaintiff tripped and fell.
 
“The elements for negligence cause
of action are duty, breach, causation, and damages.” (County of Santa Clara
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 292, 318.) The elements of a cause of action
for premises liability are the same as those for negligence: duty, breach,
causation, and damages. (Castellon v. U.S. Bancorp¿(2013) 220
Cal.App.4th 994, 998.)  Those who own,
possess, or control property generally have a duty to exercise ordinary care in
managing the property¿to¿avoid exposing others to an unreasonable risk of harm.
(Annocki¿v. Peterson Enterprises, LLC¿(2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 32,
37.)  The existence and scope of duty are
legal questions for the court. (Id. at p. 36.) 
If there is a condition that poses a danger to customers and others on
the premises, the property owner is “under a duty to exercise ordinary care
either to make the condition reasonably safe for their use or to give a warning
adequate to enable them to avoid the harm.” (Bridgman v. Safeway Stores,
Inc.¿(1960) 53 Cal.2d 443, 446.)
 
Defendant
argues that they cannot be held liable for a defective or dangerous condition
on property they do not own, possess, or control. Liability in premises cases
requires actual ownership, possession, or control, as these elements establish
the duty to maintain or ensure the safety of the premises. (Isaacs v.
Huntington Memorial Hospital (1985) 38 Cal.3d 112, 114.) Without control,
there is no duty to prevent injury. Defendant asserts that the undisputed facts
show that Defendant neither owned, possessed, nor controlled the common areas
of the property where Plaintiff’s trip and fall incident occurred, nor did Defendant
design, create, or modify the wheel stop alleged to have caused the incident.
(UMF Nos. 6-50, 11.)  As a result, Defendant
contends it is entitled to summary judgment.
 
In
opposition, Plaintiff argues that Defendant had a duty to maintain the premises
in a reasonably safe condition, including the parking lot where the incident
occurred, as it exercised control over the area. While Defendant claims it did
not own the property, Plaintiff contends that ownership is not the sole
determinant of liability; control over the premises is crucial. (University
of Southern California v. Superior Court (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 429, 445.)
 
Defendant’s
employees routinely used the parking lot to retrieve shopping carts, and the
parking lot served as a means of ingress and egress for customers, making it
effectively part of Defendant’s premises. (MF 8, 10, 11, 27.) Plaintiff further
notes that Defendant had actual notice of the dangerous condition posed by the
all-black wheel stops, as evidenced by previous tripping incidents, and failed
to warn customers or take adequate safety measures. (MF 51, 52.) While Defendant
argues its responsibility was limited to informing the property owner or
management company, Plaintiff asserts that Defendant's duty extended beyond
mere notification.
 
Additionally,
Plaintiff disputes Defendant’s claim that its lease agreement absolved it of
responsibility, arguing that the lease’s terms are ambiguous, and that Defendant’s
conduct demonstrates control over the incident location. Plaintiff concludes
that Defendant’s failure to act on its knowledge of the hazardous condition and
its control over the parking lot establishes a duty of care owed to Plaintiff,
making the case unsuitable for summary judgment.
 
In
reply, Defendant argues that summary judgment is warranted because the
undisputed facts establish that Defendant did not exercise ownership or legal
control over the parking lot where the incident occurred. While Plaintiff
concedes that Defendant did not own the property, Defendant asserts that Defendant’s
actions, such as collecting shopping carts, reporting incidents, using the lot
for customers, and regulating employee parking, do not amount to the
"dramatic assertion" of ownership necessary to establish legal
control. (Lopez v. City of Los Angeles (2020) 55 Cal.App.4th 244,
258.)
 
Defendant
emphasizes that the lease agreement between Defendant and Riviera explicitly
granted Riviera exclusive control over the parking lot, including the authority
to make physical changes. The activities performed by Defendant are described
as typical tenant actions, consistent with shared use of the parking lot by
multiple tenants, rather than indicative of ownership or control. Defendant argues
that simple maintenance or nominal influence does not meet the standard of
"control" required for premises liability. (Moses v.
Roger-McKeever (2023) 91 Cal.App.5th 172, 181.) For example, Defendant did
not take affirmative actions to limit Riviera's ability to address or remedy
conditions in the parking lot. (Contreras v. Anderson (1997) 59
Cal.App.4th 188, 200.)
 
In
University of Southern California v. Superior Court, the Court found
that USC did not exercise control over a frat house because USC did not have
exclusive rights to the property. (University of Southern California, supra,
30 Cal.App.5th 429, 446.) In Contreas, the Court found that the
Defendant did not exercise control over the property because the defendant did
not fence off the property or enjoy exclusive access. (Contreras, supra,
59 Cal.App.4th 188, 201.)
 
Here,
Defendant has shown that they are not the owner of the property where the
incident occurred. (UMF 8.) Furthermore, Defendant did not design, create,
construct, or take any affirmative action relating to the subject parking space
wheel stop that caused the subject incident. (UMF 11.) Therefore, because
Defendant has shown that they do not own or control the land where the subject
incident occurred, the Court finds that Defendant has satisfied their burden by
showing that Defendant did not owe a duty to Plaintiff.
 
Plaintiff
argues that there is a genuine dispute of material fact over whether Defendant
controlled the parking lot and, therefore, has a duty to Plaintiff. Plaintiff
argues that Defendant exercised control over the premises because customers
frequently used the parking lot, and Defendant's employees were sent into the
parking lot to collect carts. (MF 8, 10, 11, 27.) However, neither of these
instances shows the exclusive access required to exert control, as seen in University
of Southern California and Contreas. (University of Southern
California, supra, 30 Cal.App.5th 429, 446; Contreras, supra,
59 Cal.App.4th 188, 201.)  Defendant
argues that Schwartz v. Helms Bakery Limited shows that Defendant owes a
duty to care in the means of ingress and egress customers are expected to take.
(Schwartz v. Helms Bakery Limited (1967) 67 Cal.2d 232, 239.)  In Schwartz, the Court states that “the
premises may include such means of ingress and egress as a customer may
reasonably be expected to use,” but “the crucial element is control.” (Id.)
Thus, even if the parking lot was a reasonable means of egress and ingress,
Plaintiff has not shown facts to dispute that Defendant did not control the
parking lot.
 
Therefore,
the Court grants the Motion for Summary Judgment as to causes of action one and
two.
 
Causes
of action 3 – Willful Failure to Warn
 
Defendant
contends that Plaintiff's cause of action for will failure to warn under Civil
Code section 846 fails because Section 846 only applies to land used for
recreational purposes. Defendant argues that Civil Code Section 846 does not
apply to the present case because Plaintiff's injuries occurred while shopping
at Trader Joe's, not during a recreational activity. Section 846 limits
landowner liability for injuries sustained by individuals using the property
for recreational purposes, such as hiking, camping, or picnicking, and provides
immunity from negligence claims unless specific exceptions apply. (Collins v
Tippet (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 1017, 1019.)
 
The
statute is designed to encourage landowners to make their property available
for recreational use by eliminating the risk of liability for injuries
resulting from such use. To invoke Section 846, two conditions must be met: (1)
the defendant must have an interest in the property, and (2) the plaintiff's
injury must arise from a "recreational purpose" use of the property.
(Klein v. United States of America (2010) 50 Cal.4th 68, 78-79.)
 
Defendant
asserts that Plaintiff's shopping activity does not meet the recreational
purpose requirement, and no evidence supports this essential element.
Therefore, Defendant contends that Plaintiff's claim under the statute for
willful failure to warn must be dismissed as a matter of law.
 
Plaintiff
has provided no opposition to Defendant’s argument.
 
Here,
Defendants have met their burden of showing that Plaintiff’s claim for willful
failure to warn fails as a matter of law as Defendants have shown that the
property was not used for a recreational purpose. Plaintiff has provided no
evidence to show that Defendants can be held liable for willful failure to warn
under Civil Code section 846.
 
Therefore,
the Court grants the Motion for Summary Judgement as to cause of action three
for willful failure to warn.
