Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment as to causes of action one and two, which allege negligence and premises liability. The court finds that the defendant did not own or control the parking lot where the plaintiff tripped and fell, and therefore did not have a duty to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition. The court also finds that the defendant did not exercise control over the parking lot, as evidenced by the fact that the defendant did not design, create, or modify the wheel stop that caused the incident.

As to cause of action three, which alleges willful failure to warn, the court grants summary judgment in favor of the defendant. The court finds that the defendant's failure to warn is not actionable because the property was not used for a recreational purpose, as required by Civil Code section 846.

The court has reviewed the papers filed in this matter and finds that there is no triable issue of material fact and that the defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The court has exercised its discretion to review all submitted papers, including the opposition, which was filed late.
