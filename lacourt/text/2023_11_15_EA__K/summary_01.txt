Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion to amend their complaint to add new defendants and causes of action. The Plaintiff, Sukhdev Vasisht and Vansukh, Inc., alleges that they were misled by Rajinder Adlakha, who represented that he was the owner of a commercial property and a laundromat and check cashing business. The Plaintiff claims that Adlakha failed to sign supplemental contract documents, withdrew rental income, and failed to pay mortgage payments, causing the business to be abandoned prior to changeover. The Judge has denied the motion because the Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that the proposed amendments are necessary and proper, and because the Plaintiff has failed to provide sufficient evidence to support their claims. The Judge has also noted that the Plaintiff's lack of due diligence in investigating the property and the loan submission to the SBA was a factor in the denial of the motion.
