And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to consolidate the above cases. The motion was filed on March 27, 2023, and has been continued multiple times. The case has been reassigned to different departments and judges, including Judge Gridiron Winston in Department 6, West Covina Courthouse. Despite the multiple changes, there is no indication that the plaintiff, C. Milliner, has given notice of the case reassignment to the parties. Furthermore, the moving defendants' counsel, Lisa Louise Renaud, has not provided notice of the change in location of the hearing. The judge intends to schedule a hearing in Department K, but is concerned that the parties have not been properly notified of the change.
