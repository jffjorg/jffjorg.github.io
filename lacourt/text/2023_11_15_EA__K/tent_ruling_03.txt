 Case Number:  21PSCV00758    Hearing Date:   November 15, 2023    Dept:  K Plaintiff
SoCal Lien Solutions LLC’s Application for Default Judgment is DENIED without
prejudice.
Background   
Plaintiff SoCal Lien Solutions LLC (“Plaintiff”) alleges as
follows:
Plaintiff’s assignor, C&M
Stucco Specialists, Inc. (“Assignor”) provided certain improvements to the
property located at 1155 Via Verde, San Dimas, California, 91773 (“subject
property”) but has not been paid in full.
On September 15, 2021, Plaintiff filed a complaint, asserting
causes of action against Pacific Core Construction, Inc., ADP of San Dimas, LLC
(“ADP”), Advocacy Development Partners, LLC (“Advocacy Development”) and Does
1-10 for:
1.                 
Open Book Account
2.                 
Services Rendered
3.                 
Foreclosure of Mechanic’s Lien
On September 29, 2021, Plaintiff dismissed ADP and Advocacy
Development, with prejudice.
On October 25, 2023, Plaintiff filed an “Amendment to
Complaint,” wherein the name of “Pacific Core Construction Inc.” was corrected
to “Pacificore Construction, Inc.” (“Pacificore”).
On August 8, 2023, Pacificore’s default was entered.
An Order to Show Cause Re: Default Judgment is set for
November 15, 2023.
Discussion
Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment is denied without
prejudice. The following defects are noted:
1.                 
Plaintiff has failed to utilize Judicial
Council Form CIV-100 [Rev. January 1, 2023].
2.                 
Plaintiff has failed to provide the court
with a brief summary of the case, as per 
California
Rules of Court (“CRC”), Rule 3.1800, subdivision (a)(1).
3.                 
Paragraph 2(e) of Plaintiff’s Judicial
Council Form CIV-100 lists attorney’s fees of $38,003.85 under the “Amount”
column. This appears to be a typographical error, inasmuch as it is the same
amount listed in the “Amount” column of Paragraph 2(f) and as the proposed
judgment does not seek attorneys’ fees; clarification, however, is requested.
4.                 
Kathryn Ann (“Ann”) is requested to attach
and authenticate the assignment attached as Exhibit A to Plaintiff’s unverified
complaint. 
5.                 
Ann attests that the amount owing was
$37,378.60, that a payment of $29,978.60 was made by a co-defendant in the
action during the course of the litigation and that the adjusted claim amount
is $7,500.00. (Ann Decl., 2:14-19). Paragraph 2(a) of Plaintiff’s Judicial
Council Form CIV-100, however, lists the balance as $10,485.00, not $7,500.00.
This discrepancy must be reconciled.
