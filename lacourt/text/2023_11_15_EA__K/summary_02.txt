And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to set aside a Business Loan Agreement dated November 26, 2019, between Vasisht and Bank. The motion was filed and served via email on October 20, 2023, but the notice period calculation is affected by a court holiday on November 10, 2023. Bank and Chong have opposed the motion on its merits, arguing that the appearance and opposition to the motion waive any defects or irregularities in the notice. The judge notes that the motion was timely filed but not served electronically as required, and that the notice period calculation is extended after service by electronic means by two court days. Despite this, the judge concludes that the motion defects are waived by the opponents' appearance and opposition, and tentatively rules in favor of Bank and Chong.
