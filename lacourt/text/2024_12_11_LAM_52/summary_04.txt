And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the petition filed by John Flaherty to release real property from the claim of mechanics lien held by Restorerz Emergency Services, LLC. The judge has determined that Restorerz Emergency Services, LLC did not commence an action to enforce the lien within the required 90-day period, and therefore the claim of lien has expired and is unenforceable. The judge has also found that John Flaherty complied with all requirements for filing the petition, including serving the petition and notice of hearing on the claimant, and demanding that the claimant execute and record a release of the claim of lien. As a result, the judge is releasing the real property from the claim of lien and granting John Flaherty reasonable attorney fees.
