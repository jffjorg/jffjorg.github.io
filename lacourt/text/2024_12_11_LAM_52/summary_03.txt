Here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the petition of Rich Horizons, LLC to approve the transfer of structured settlement payment rights from Rosario Maselli. The court must determine whether the transfer is fair and reasonable and in the best interest of the payee. The judge found that the equivalent interest rate of 25.92% is too high and that Maselli is not properly ensuring that the transfer is fair, reasonable, and in her best interest. The judge also noted that Maselli has the right to independent legal or financial advice, but waived that right. The judge concluded that it is in Maselli's best interest not to transfer her rights to the future payments for $60,936.85.
