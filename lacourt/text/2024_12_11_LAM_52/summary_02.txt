And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion of plaintiff Jane M.R. Doe to reopen discovery to permit the depositions of four witnesses: Cassandra Roy, Aadil Naazir, Marilyn Fuller, and Peter Misseijer. The plaintiff seeks to depose these witnesses to gather evidence to oppose the defendant Los Angeles Unified School District's (LAUSD) motion for summary judgment. The court finds that the plaintiff has shown good cause to reopen discovery, as the witnesses' declarations were submitted in support of LAUSD's motion, and the statute on summary judgment motions contemplates that additional discovery may be required to oppose such a motion. The court also finds that the plaintiff has shown adequate diligence, as they became aware of the witnesses months ago but only sought to depose them after LAUSD filed its motion. The court grants the motion and reopens discovery solely to permit the plaintiff to depose the four specified witnesses.
