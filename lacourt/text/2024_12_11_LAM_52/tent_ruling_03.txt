 Case Number:  24STCP02551    Hearing Date:   December 11, 2024    Dept:  52 Petitioner Rich Horizons, LLC’s First
Amended Petition for Approval of Transfer of Structured Settlement Payment
Rights 
Petitioner Rich Horizons, LLC petitions for approval
of transfer of structured settlement rights by payee Rosario Maselli.  The court must determine whether the transfer “is fair and
reasonable and in the best interest of the payee.”  (Ins. Code, § 10137(a).)  Specifically, the court must consider
“[w]hether the financial terms of the transaction, including the discount rate
applied to determine the amount to be paid to the payee, the expenses and costs
of the transaction for both the payee and the transferee, the size of the transaction,
the available financial alternatives to the payee to achieve the payee’s stated
objectives, are fair and reasonable.” 
(Ins. Code, § 10139.5(b)(9).)  
Maselli
agreed to transfer rights to a total of $176,500 in payments due from 2025 to
2036.  (Amended Petition, Ex. A, p.
11.)  Petitioner will pay Maselli
$60,936.85 for the right to those future payments.  (Ibid.)  This transaction is equivalent to paying
25.92% interest on a loan.  (Id.,
p. 13, ¶ F.)  
Maselli
states, “I intend to use the proceeds I receive from Rich H under the Agreement
to work closely with a financial to monitor and grow my money.”  (Maselli Decl., ¶ 10.)  Maselli has the right under Insurance Code
section 10139.5, subdivision (h) to have petitioner pay up to $1,500 for
independent legal or financial advice about this transaction.  As required, petitioner advised Maselli of
that right, which she waived.  The time
to begin working with a financial advisor is before the transfer, when petitioner
must pay up to $1,500 of the cost of that advice.  Someone who waives that right but claims she
plans to “work closely with a financial advisor to monitor and grow my money” (Maselli
Decl., ¶ 10) is not properly ensuring the transfer is fair, reasonable, and in
her best interest.  
Moreover,
the terms of this transaction are not fair, reasonable, or in Maselli’s best
interest.  The equivalent interest rate
of 25.92% is too high.  It is unlikely
that any effort to grow her money would result in a better return on investment
than 25.92%.  Any investment that could
plausibly perform that well would pose a significant risk of losing money.  Taking the $60,936.85 now may “improve [her]
present standard of living” (Maselli Decl., ¶ 9), but she does not have to wait
long for the first payment, which is substantial: $25,500 on July 9, 2025.  (Ex. A, p. 11.)  By July 2027, Maselli will be paid $76,500,
25% more than she will be paid now in this transfer.  (Ibid.)  And this transaction would also transfer
Maselli’s rights to payments of $40,000 in 2031 and $60,000 in 2036.  (Ibid.)  It is in Maselli’s best interest not to
transfer her rights to these future payments for $60,936.85.
Petitioner Rich Horizons, LLC’s first
amended petition for approval for transfer of structured settlement payment
rights is denied.
