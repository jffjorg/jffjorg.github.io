And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining defendant BMW of North America, LLC's demurrer to the complaint filed by plaintiffs Joshua De Paz and Milvia Ramos. The plaintiffs alleged five causes of action, including violations of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, breach of express written warranty, and breach of implied warranty of merchantability, arising from alleged defects in the 2019 BMW 530 E they purchased in April 2023. The judge found that the plaintiffs did not allege sufficient facts to support their claims, as the vehicle was not new and the defendant did not issue a new vehicle warranty with the sale. The judge gave the plaintiffs 20 days to file a first amended complaint to correct the deficiencies.
