And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

Judge grants plaintiff's motion to reopen discovery to permit the deposition of four witnesses: Cassandra Roy, Aadil Naazir, Marilyn Fuller, and Peter Misseijer. The plaintiff sought to reopen discovery to depose these witnesses because LAUSD submitted declarations from them in support of its motion for summary judgment. The judge finds that the plaintiff has shown good cause to reopen discovery, as the statute on summary judgment motions contemplates that additional discovery may be required to oppose such a motion. The judge also finds that the plaintiff has shown adequate diligence and that permitting the depositions will not prevent the case from going to trial on the scheduled date. The judge orders the parties to meet and confer to schedule the depositions no later than December 18, 2024.
