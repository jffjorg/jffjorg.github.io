 Case Number:  24STCV19698    Hearing Date:   December 11, 2024    Dept:  52 Non-Appearance Case Review Re: Default
Judgment
Plaintiff RESQ HR, LLC requested clerk’s judgment by
default against defendant Apex HR Solutions, LLC.  Plaintiff’s application establishes it is
entitled to default judgment.  
Plaintiff did not, however, request
dismissal of defendants Does 1-10.  A
request for default judgment must include “[a] dismissal of all parties against
whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment against
specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a
showing of grounds for each judgment.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a)(7).)  Plaintiff does not seek default judgment against
the Doe defendants.  They therefore must
be dismissed.  The court hereby dismisses
defendants Does 1-10 without prejudice. 
 
Plaintiff’s request for default judgment is granted.  The court hereby directs the clerk to sign
and enter clerk’s judgment on the form JUD-100 plaintiff submitted on November
12, 2024.
