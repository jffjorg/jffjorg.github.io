And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, Eaze Technologies Inc., sought a bill of particulars from the plaintiff or for the court to preclude the plaintiff from presenting evidence for its fourth cause of action for money had and received, citing Code Civ. Proc. ยง 454. However, the motion is denied as moot because the plaintiff has now served the defendant with a bill of particulars. Counsel are instructed to submit on the tentative ruling, and those who do not submit are strongly encouraged to appear via LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
