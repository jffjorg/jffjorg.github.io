```

And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Further Responses and Documents from the Defendant, Zanna USA 2SB Holdings, Inc. The Motion was granted in part, as the Court ruled that the Plaintiff's requests for production of documents, including information about shareholders, managers, banks, and profit and loss statements, are not private and are relevant to identifying witnesses and establishing damages. However, the Court denied the Motion as to requests 13-14, which involve documents subject to the taxpayer privilege. The Defendant subsequently served supplemental responses to the subject discovery, which the Court finds sufficient. As a result, the Motion to Compel is denied as moot. The Court awards sanctions in the reduced amount of $800, as the Defendant served responses only with its Opposition.
