Defendant Eaze Technologies Inc. seeks a bill of particulars from Plaintiff or for the Court to preclude Plaintiff from presenting evidence for its fourth cause of action for money had and received.Code Civ. Proc. § 454 states in relevant part, “It is not necessary for a party to set forth in a pleading the items of an account therein alleged, but he must deliver to the adverse party, within ten days after a demand thereof in writing, a copy of the account, or be precluded from giving evidence thereof.”“A demand for bill of particulars may be served on the plaintiff only in an action on ‘an account.’ . . .  ‘On account’ . . . means any action in contract or quasi-contract consisting of one or more items and pleaded in general terms. The most frequent case is where the complaint contains one or more of the common counts: • Open book accounts; • For labor and materials furnished under a contract; • For monies loaned; • For ‘money had and received.’ ”  (Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial Ch. 8K-2.)The Motion is denied as moot because Plaintiff indicates that it has now served Defendant with a bill of particulars.  (Welch Decl. at ¶ 5, Ex. A.)Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
