SHANGHAI HONGBAO LIGHTING CO., LTD., a Chinese Corporation,

 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Jilbert Tahmazian,
  Esq. and Tahmazian Law Firm, P.C.’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel.



 
On March 8, 2024, Jilbert Tahmazian, Esq. and Tahmazian Law
Firm, P.C. filed a (1) a motion to be relieved as counsel for Defendant T-1
Lightning, Inc. on Judicial Council form MC-051, (2) a declaration in support
of their motion to be relieved as counsel on Judicial Council form MC-052, and
(3) a proposed order in support of their motion to be relieved as counsel on
Judicial Council form MC-053. All three of these filings attach proofs of
service showing service on Defendant T-1 Lightning, Inc. via mail but failing
to show service on Plaintiff Shanghai Hongbao Lightning Co., Ltd. (Shanghai
Hongbao). (3/8/24 MC-051, MC-052, MC-053, Proofs of Service.)
The motion is unopposed.
A motion to be relieved as counsel must comply with California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362. A court may deny a motion to relieve counsel based on undue
prejudice or undue delay. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915; Mandell v. Superior Court (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 1,
4.)
Here, Jilbert Tahmazian, Esq. and Tahmazian Law Firm, P.C. comply with
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 by filing properly filled out Judicial
Council forms MC-051 to MC-053 and attaching proofs of service for the same on
Defendant T-1 Lightning, Inc. However, the Court notes that this motion does
not appear to have been served on Plaintiff Shanghai Hongbao. (3/8/24 MC-051,
MC-052, MC-053, Proofs of Service.)
The motion also gives a proper reason for withdrawal as part of Judicial
Council form MC-052: Defendant cannot pay fees, and ongoing representation
without payment of fees will cause hardship to counsel. (3/8/24 MC-052, § 2.)
The Court otherwise notes that because no trial is set in this action,
which was initiated on February 1, 2023, no undue prejudice or delay exists to
deny this motion.
Jilbert Tahmazian, Esq. and Tahmazian Law Firm, P.C.’s motion is thus
GRANTED, conditioned on proof of service of counsel’s motion on Plaintiff or
Plaintiff’s non-opposition to withdrawal at the hearing.
Defendant T-1 Lightning, Inc., is advised of its need to find a
substitute attorney, or it will face the possibility of a dismissal or default for
lack of representation. This is because in California, a company cannot
represent itself in court. (See Gamet v. Blanchard (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th
1276, 1284, fn. 5 [court has duty to inform corporate client of need for
representation].)
Withdrawal SHALL not be effective until proof of service of this order is
filed with the Court showing service of this order on all parties, as granted
without conditions.
