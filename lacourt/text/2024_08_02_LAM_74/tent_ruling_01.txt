et al. v. American Honda Motor Co., Inc.
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel
Deposition of the Person Most Knowledgeable for American Honda Motor Co., Inc.
and Request for Production of Documents
 

 

 
BACKGROUND 
            On
January 5, 2022, Eri Cortez and Eunice Cortez (Plaintiffs) filed this action
against Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc. (Defendant or Honda) The First
Amended Complaint (FAC) asserts causes of action for: (1) Violation of
Subdivision (d) of Civil Code Section 1793.2, (2) Violation of Subdivision (b)
of Civil Code Section 1793.2, (3) Violation of Subdivision (a)(3) of Civil Code
Section 1793.2, (4) Breach of Implied Warranty of Merchantability, and (5)
Fraudulent Inducement – Concealment. The FAC alleges Plaintiffs 2019 Honda
Pilot suffered from various defects, including those related to the
infotainment system. 
            The
motion now before the Court is Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Deposition of the
Person Most Knowledgeable for American Honda Motor Co., Inc. and Request for
Production of Documents (the Motion). No opposition was filed. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
¿¿            A
motion lies to compel deposition attendance and document production, after
service of a deposition notice, where a deponent fails to appear at, or proceed
with, a deposition, without having served a valid objection. (CCP
§2025.450(a).) No meet and confer is required to compel initial deposition
attendance, but instead there must be a declaration showing that moving party
inquired about the nonappearance. (CCP §2025.450(b)(2).)   
            “Implicit
in the requirement that counsel contact the deponent to inquire about the
nonappearance is a requirement that counsel listen to the reasons offered and
make a good faith attempt to resolve the issue,” including by rescheduling. (Leko
v. Cornerstone Bldg. Inspection Serv. (2001) 86 Cal. App. 4th
1109, 1124. See also L.A.S.C.L.R.
3.26, Appendix 3.A(e) (reasonable consideration should be given to
accommodating schedules in setting depositions).)  
 
DISCUSSION  
            Plaintiffs
contend that they have been attempting to take the deposition of Honda’s person
most knowledgeable (PMK) since April of 2023. (Declaration of Hannah C.
Theophil, ¶22.) On April 26, 2023, Plaintiffs served a Notice of Deposition for
Honda’s PMK for a June 26, 2023 deposition. (Id.) However, Honda
objected stating that neither witness nor counsel would be available. On August
11, 2023, Plaintiffs’ counsel sent an email to Honda requesting dates for the
deposition of the PMK, however, no response was received. Plaintiffs’ counsel
followed up on September 11, 2023, but again no response was given. (Id.
at ¶24.) On October 4, 2023 Plaintiffs served an Amended Notice of Deposition
for Honda’s PMK. The deposition was to take place on October 13, 2023.
Accompanying this second notice was a meet and confer letter. Honda objected to
the second notice and did not respond to the meet and confer letter. (Id.
at ¶26.) As Plaintiffs have shown that Honda has failed to provide valid
objections, failed to meet and confer, and as Honda has provided no opposition,
the Motion is granted.       
 
CONCLUSION 
            Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Deposition of the Person Most Knowledgeable for American Honda
Motor Co., Inc. and Request for Production of Documents is GRANTED.
Defendant’s objections are struck. Defendant is ordered to produce the
documents requested in Plaintiffs’ Amended PMK Deposition Notice and is to
schedule a deposition date within ten (10) calendar days of this order. 
Plaintiffs
shall give notice.
