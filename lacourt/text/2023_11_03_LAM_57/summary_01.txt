And here is the English-text summary:

The Court agrees with the Defendant's argument that proceedings in this Court must be stayed pending the Defendant's appeal of the Court's August 8, 2023 order vacating the January 10, 2023 order compelling the parties to arbitrate the Plaintiff's claims and staying proceedings in this Court pending the outcome of the arbitration. The Court rests this determination on three considerations: an appeal from an order denying a motion to compel arbitration automatically stays proceedings in the trial court pending the appeal; an aggrieved party may appeal from an order vacating a prior order granting a motion to compel arbitration and staying proceedings in the trial court; and an order vacating an order compelling arbitration is the functional equivalent of an order denying a petition to compel arbitration in the first place. As a result, the Court has stayed proceedings in this Court pending the outcome of the Defendant's appeal. A conference on the status of the appeal is set for July 2, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.
