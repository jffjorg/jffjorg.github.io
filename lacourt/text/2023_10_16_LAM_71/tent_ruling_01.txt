granted (July 19, 2023).
 
Plaintiff Merary Gomez Carbajal (“Gomez Carbajal”)
(“Plaintiff”) moves for this Court to reconsider its January 11, 2023,
order (“1/11/23 Ruling”) granting Defendant FCA US, LLC’s (“FCA”) (“Defendant”)
motion to compel arbitration.  (Notice of
Motion, pg. 2.)  
 
Procedural Background
          On March 30,
2022, Plaintiff filed her operative complaint against FCA, Premier Automotive
of Placentia, LLC (“Premier Automotive”), and Premier Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram
of Buena Park (“Premier Buena Park”) (collectively, “Defendants”) alleging two
causes of action under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, Civil Code
§§1790 et seq. (“Song-Beverly”) and one in common law tort: (1) violation of Song-Beverly- breach of express warranty [against
FCA]; (2) violation
of Song-Beverly- breach of implied warranty [against FCA]; and (3)
negligent repair [against Premier Buena Park]
arising from Plaintiff’s September 15, 2020 entry into a warranty contract with
FCA regarding a 2020 Jeep Cherokee [“Subject Vehicle”].
          On January
11, 2023, this Court granted FCA’s motion to compel arbitration of Plaintiff’s
claims.  (1/11/23 Ruling.)
          Plaintiff
filed the instant motion on June 22, 2023. 
FCA and Premier Automotive filed their opposition on October 4,
2023.  Plaintiff filed her reply on October
9, 2023.  
 
Motion for Reconsideration
C.C.P. §1008(c) provides, as follows: “If a court at
any time determines that there has been a change of law that warrants it to
reconsider a prior order it entered, it may do so on its own motion and enter a
different order.” 
(C.C.P. §1008(c).)
Defendants’ objection to Plaintiff’s motion as untimely
because it was not filed within 10 days of notice of entry of the 1/11/23
Ruling is unavailing.  In Malek v.
Blue Cross of California (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 44, the Court of
Appeal determined that a change in the law required the trial court to
reconsider its prior ruling compelling arbitration.  (Id. at pgs. 59-60.)  The Malek Court stated, “the progress
of the arbitration is not material when considering a change in the law
affecting whether the arbitral forum was a correct one.”  (Id. at pg. 60.)  
“If a court believes one of its prior interim orders was
erroneous, it should be able to correct that error no matter how it came to
acquire that belief. For example, nothing would prevent the losing party from
asking the court at a status conference to reconsider a ruling.  (See Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial, supra, § 9:327.8, p.
9(1)–107.)  But a party may not file a
written motion to reconsider that has procedural significance
if it does not satisfy the requirements of section 437c, subdivision
(f)(2), or 1008. The court need not rule on any suggestion that it
should reconsider a previous ruling and, without more, another party would not
be expected to respond to such a suggestion.” 
(Le Francois v. Goel (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1094, 1108, as
modified (June 10, 2005).)  
          Plaintiff
requests this Court reconsider its 1/11/23 Ruling in light of the publication
of Yeh v. Superior Court of Contra Costa County (Cal. Ct. App., Sept. 6, 2023, No.
A166537) 2023 WL 5741703; Kielar v. Superior Court of Placer
County (Cal. Ct. App., Aug. 16, 2023, No.
C096773) 2023 WL 5270559; Montemayor v. Ford Motor Company (2023) 92
Cal.App.5th 958, review filed (Aug. 1, 2023); and Ford Motor Warranty
Cases (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324, review granted (July 19, 2023)
Here, the Court has been put on notice of new case law that
disagrees with Felisilda, the case on which this Court relied to grant the
1/11/23 Ruling.  Accordingly, the Court will sua sponte
reconsider its Order.
Parties are to submit
simultaneous briefs on November 28, 2023, regarding the new case law that
disagrees with Felisilda: Yeh, Kielar, Montemayor, and Ford Motor Warranty Cases.
Accordingly, the Court sua
sponte sets a hearing to reconsider Defendants’ motion to compel
arbitration for Tuesday, December 12, 2023, at 8:30 a.m.
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration is continued to Tuesday,
December 12, 2023, at 8:30 a.m.
The Court sua sponte sets a hearing to reconsider
Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration for Tuesday, December 12,
2023, at
8:30 a.m.  Parties are to submit
simultaneous briefs on November 28, 2023.
Moving Party to
give notice.
