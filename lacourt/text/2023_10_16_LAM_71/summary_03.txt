And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendants' motion to compel the deposition of Jose Solano, but limits the deposition to three hours. Solano failed to appear for his deposition on September 14, 2023, and filed an untimely objection to the notice of deposition. The judge finds that good cause exists to compel Solano's deposition due to the new causes of action alleged in his Cross-Complaint. The judge also grants the defendants' request for sanctions in the amount of $1,390.00, which is calculated based on the reasonable expenses incurred by the defendants' counsel in preparing the motion and corresponding with Solano's counsel.
