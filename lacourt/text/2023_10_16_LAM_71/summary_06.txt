And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' request to strike the plaintiff's trial subpoenas without a noticed motion. However, the defendants are allowed to file a single omnibus motion to quash by October 17, 2023, as long as it provides a concise outline of the items requested and each objection thereto, as required by CRC Rule 3.1345(b)(2). The court has set a hearing on the defendants' motion and the plaintiff's motion to quash for October 23, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. in Department 71. The plaintiff's ex parte motion has been granted, and oppositions to both motions are due by October 18, 2023, with replies due by October 20, 2023.
