 Case No.: 
  22STCV25657
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  October 16, 2023



 
Defendants
Pinnacle Estate Properties, Inc.’s, Jeremy Rodriguez’s, and Sylvia Ena’s
motion to compel the deposition of Cross-Complainant Jose Solano is granted but
limited to three hours.  Jose Solano is
ordered to appear for depositions and produce documents within 10 days of this
ruling.
 
Defendants
Pinnacle Estate Properties, Inc.’s, Jeremy Rodriguez’s, and Sylvia Ena’s
request for sanctions is granted in the reduced amount of $1,390.00.
 
          Defendants
Pinnacle Estate Properties, Inc.’s (“Pinnacle”), Jeremy Rodriguez (“Rodriguez”),
and Sylvia Ena (“Ena”) (collectively, “Defendants”) move to compel Cross-Complainant Jose Solano[1] (“Solano”)
(“Cross-Complainant”) to appear for deposition.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2;
C.C.P. §§2034.210 et seq., 2025.450, 2025.610.)  Defendants request sanctions against Solano
and/or his counsel of record in the amount of $1,580.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2.)
 
          Meet and Confer
A motion to compel a deposition must be accompanied by a
declaration stating facts showing “a reasonable and good faith attempt at an
informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.”  (C.C.P. §§2016.040, 2025.480(b).)
Defendants’ counsel declares that Cross-Complainant’s counsel sent
a meet and confer letter on or about September 5, 2023, arguing that a second
deposition for Solano is not allowed under the rules and proposed a limited
scope of two hours for a second deposition. 
(Decl. of Hawatmeh ¶9, Exh. C.)   Defendants’ counsel declares she responded
to the meet and confer letter by email on or about September 6, 2023, arguing
the discovery cut-off had not passed and that Defendants did not have the
benefit of knowing what Cross-Complainant’s allegations would be prior to its
filing.  (Decl. of Hawatmeh ¶10, Exh. D.).
Defendants’ counsel’s declaration does not indicate the parties met and
conferred by telephone.  Defendants’
counsel’s declaration does not substantially comply with the requirements of
C.C.P. §2016.040.  Regardless, the Court
in its discretion will consider Defendants’ motion.
 
Background
Defendants served a Notice of Deposition
of Solano on August 24, 2023, for the date of September 14, 2023.  (Decl. of Hawatmeh ¶8,
Exh. B.)  On September 8, 2023, Solano
served an untimely objection to Defendants’ notice of deposition.  (Decl.
of Hawatmeh ¶11, Exh. E.)
 On September 14, 2023, Solano
did not appear for his deposition.  (Decl.
of Hawatmeh ¶12, Exh. F.)  
Defendants filed the instant motion on
September 18, 2023.  Solano filed his
opposition on October 2, 2023.  Plaintiffs
Teodulo Castellanos (“Teodulo”) and Maria Castellanos (“Maria”) (collectively,
“Plaintiffs”) filed their opposition on October 2, 2023.  Defendants filed the replies to Solano and
Plaintiffs on October 9, 2023.
 
          Discussion
C.C.P. §2025.450 states,
in pertinent part, as follows:
(a) If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an
officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person
designated by an organization that is a party under Section 2025.230, without
having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document,
. . . described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move
for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production
for inspection of any document, . . .  described in the deposition notice.
 
(1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing good cause
justifying the production for inspection of any document . . . described in the
deposition notice.
 
(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration
under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition
and produce the documents . . . described in the deposition notice, by a
declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire
about the nonappearance.
 
(C.C.P. §2025.450(a).)
In the context of a motion to compel,
the information or testimony should be compelled if the moving party simply
shows “good cause” for the request.  (C.C.P.
§2025.450(b)(1).)  Similarly, the Court
can order the second deposition of a natural person by a party that was served
with the first deposition notice based on a showing of “good cause.”  (C.C.P. §§2025.610(a), (b); Fairmont Insurance
Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 254.)  “Good cause” is liberally construed, and
discovery is justified where specific facts show that the evidence is necessary
for effective trial preparation or to prevent surprise at trial.  (Associated Brewers District Co., Inc. v.
Superior Court (1967) 65 Cal.2d 583, 587.)  A party is not subject to repeated depositions
on the same factual issue, but there is no absolute limitation that a party may
only take a single deposition.  (Carlson
v. Superior Court (1961) 56 Cal.2d 431, 439 n.5.)
          A
party who seeks to resist or limit a self-executing form of discovery has the
burden of producing facts that establish, to the Court’s satisfaction, good
cause for denying or limiting the discovery sought.  (Southern California Edison Co. v. Superior
Court (1972) 7 Cal.3d 832, 843.) 
          Defendants’
motion to compel the deposition of Solano is granted.  Solano filed his Cross-Complaint about a
month after his first deposition was taken, and it alleges new causes of action
that necessitate further discovery by Defendants.   (Decl. of Hawatmeh ¶¶ 4-6.)  However, in light of Solano’s prior
deposition on November 10, 2022, lasting almost three hours, the second
deposition at issue in this motion is limited to three hours.  (C.C.P. §2025.290(a).)
The Court grants Defendants’ motion
pursuant to C.C.P. §2025.450 and orders Solano to appear for deposition
within 10 days of this ruling.
 
Sanctions
C.C.P. §2023.030(a) provides that a
court “may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse
of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay
the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a
result of that conduct.”
Defendants’ counsel declares her hourly
fees are $190 per hour, and she spent 5 hours preparing the instant motion and corresponding
with counsel for Solano regarding his deposition.  (Decl. of Hawatmeh ¶14.)  However, reasonable attorneys’ fees cannot be
compensated for time incurred meeting and conferring.  Defendants’ counsel also requests three
additional hours to draft a reply brief and appear in court.  Defendants’ counsel also requests $60 for the
costs to file the instant motion.
Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff
sanctions in the amount of $1,390.00, as calculated below:
(7 hours x $190/hour) + $60 filing fee =
$1,390.00
 
Conclusion
Defendants’ motion to compel Solano to appear for deposition is granted
and limited to three hours.  Solano is to
appear for deposition with 10 days of this ruling.
Defendants’ request for
sanctions is granted in the reduced amount of $1,390.00.
Moving Party is to give
notice of this ruling.
