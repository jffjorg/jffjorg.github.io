And here is the summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling is for the case number 24STCV08952, hearing date November 6, 2024, department 39. The case involves a motion to quash a subpoena filed by the plaintiff, Jesus Jose Acosta, against the defendant, Taft Electric Company. The subpoena seeks all of the plaintiff's employment records, including documents related to his termination from previous jobs and termination notices from employers.

The court has denied the motion to quash the subpoena, finding that the defendant has a legitimate interest in conducting discovery on the plaintiff's work history to determine if the plaintiff's allegations of age discrimination are supported by evidence. The court notes that the plaintiff has a right of privacy in his employment records, but this right is not absolute and may be outweighed by the defendant's need for discovery.

The court also declined to award sanctions to the defendant, finding that the plaintiff's motion to quash was brought in good faith based on his privacy rights. The court orders the plaintiff to give notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
