Motions to Quash Depositions

MOTION
              Plaintiff
Kenneth Oleesky (“Plaintiff”) moves to quash deposition notices that Defendant Van
Nuys-L, Inc. (“Defendant”) served on Deponents Haig Panossian, M.D., Florcita Bryan
Duc Nguyen, and Carrie Ann Algozine, D.O. (“Deponents”).  Plaintiff designated Deponents as expert
witnesses.  Defendant opposes the motions.
ANALYSIS
When the trial in this case was set to commence
on October 15, 2025, in its order of November 8, 2023 concerning the parties’
stipulation to continue the trial, the Court accepted the stipulation and noted
pursuant to it ‘“[a]ll discovery deadlines are extended to sixty (60) days
before the new trial date,’  i.e., August
16, 2024.”  (See November 8, 2023 Minute
Order, p. 2.)  Defendants do not dispute
they served the three notices of depositions at issue after the discovery
cut-off date.  Accordingly, the Court
grants the motion to quash those notices. 

In opposition, Defendant argues it “understood
that the August 16 discovery cutoff date applied only to fact discovery.”  (Defendants’ Omnibus Opposition to Motion to
Quash, p. 1.)  The Court’s November 8,
2023 order, however, as noted above, explicitly applies to all discovery
deadlines, including expert witness discovery.  If Defendant believed that order was issued in
error, Defendant should have sought relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 1008, subdivision (e).  Defendant
did not do so.  Moreover,  even though this Court on October 4, 2024 continued
the trial to October 7, 2025 (see October 4, 2024 Minute Order), Defendant has not moved to reopen discovery
to take the depositions at issue.
Defendant also argues Plaintiff denied
Defendant’s right to complete the cross-examination of Dr. Florcita Soraya Alvarez-Galoosian
(“Alvarez-Galoosian”).  That issue is not
part and parcel of the three motions presently before the Court, as it is the
subject of a motion to be heard on January 23, 2024.  (See October 4, 2024 Minute Order, p. 1.)  
Because the Court
does not credit any confusion Defendant may have had concerning the application
of the discovery cutoff date to expert witnesses, and Defendant chose not to obtain
any relief from that date, it finds Defendant’s notices of expert witness depositions
in violation of the discovery cut-off date constitute abuses of the discovery
process and imposes sanctions.  Defendant
and its counsel of record, Saber Law Group, jointly and severally, are to pay
sanctions in the amount of $2,380, which represents four hours of attorney time
to prepare the motions and attend the hearing at $595 per hour.  Defendant and its counsel of record, Saber
Law Group, are to pay $2,380 in sanctions to Plaintiff, by and through counsel,
within 30 days.
Plaintiff is to give notice of this
order and to file proof of service of same.
