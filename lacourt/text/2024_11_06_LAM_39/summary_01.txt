And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash deposition notices served by the defendant, Van Nuys-L, Inc., on expert witnesses Haig Panossian, M.D., Florcita Bryan Duc Nguyen, and Carrie Ann Algozine, D.O. The plaintiff, Kenneth Oleesky, sought to quash the notices, arguing that they were served after the discovery cut-off date of August 16, 2024. The court agrees with the plaintiff and grants the motion to quash the notices.

The court notes that the defendant did not dispute serving the notices after the discovery cut-off date and did not seek relief to reopen discovery. The court also finds that the defendant's notices of expert witness depositions constitute an abuse of the discovery process.

Additionally, the court imposes sanctions on the defendant and its counsel, Saber Law Group, in the amount of $2,380, which represents four hours of attorney time to prepare the motions and attend the hearing. The defendant and its counsel are required to pay the sanctions to the plaintiff within 30 days.
