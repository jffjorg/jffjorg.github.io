```

Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the court's prior order denying leave to file a fourth amended complaint. The court finds that the motion is untimely, lacks a code-compliant affidavit, and relies on new evidence that was available at the time of the prior hearing. However, the court is inclined to grant the plaintiff leave to amend to state a single cause of action for breach of contract, but only if the plaintiff excludes irrelevant allegations and limits the amended complaint to 12 pages. The court also orders the plaintiff to explain any inconsistent allegations between the prior pleadings and to provide further facts regarding the services performed after the January invoice.
