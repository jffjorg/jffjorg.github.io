Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the unopposed motion filed by Defendant Salomon Melchor to compel responses to Form Interrogatories-General, Set One. The motion was filed because Plaintiff Ramiro Hernandez failed to serve timely responses to the interrogatories, despite being granted extensions. The judge found that Hernandez's failure to respond waived any objections to the interrogatories, including those based on privilege or protection for work product.

The judge also granted in part Defendant's request for monetary sanctions. The total and reasonable amount of attorney's fees and costs incurred for work performed in connection with the motion is $360.00. Hernandez and his attorney are ordered to jointly and severally pay this amount to Defendant's counsel within 20 days.

The judge ordered Plaintiff Ramiro Hernandez to serve verified responses, without objection, to the Form Interrogatories-General, Set One, within 20 days.
