Los Angeles Superior Court Case No. 23CHCV03054

 
Motion
filed: 7/24/24
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant State Farm Mutual Automobile
Insurance Company 
RESPONDING PARTY: None.
NOTICE: OK.
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED: An
order compelling Plaintiff Larry Brent to serve verified responses, without
objection, to Defendant State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company’s Special
Interrogatories, Set One. 
 
TENTATIVE
RULING: The
motion is GRANTED.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from an alleged breach of contract by the
insurer defendant. Plaintiff Larry Brent (“Plaintiff” or “Brent”) alleges that
Defendant State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (“Defendant” or “State
Farm”) refused to compensate him for damages to his insured vehicle, despite a
valid policy being in place during the March 7, 2022, incident that caused
damages to his vehicle, in breach of the agreed-upon insurance policy between
the parties. (Compl. ¶¶ 7-12.)
 
On October 11, 2023, Plaintiff filed his Complaint against
Defendant State Farm and Does 1 to 25, alleging the following causes of action:
(1) Breach of Contract, (2) Tortious Breach of the Covenant of Good Faith and
Fair Dealing, and (3) Declaratory Relief. 
 
On January 4, 2024, the Department F51 Court sustained State
Farm’s Demurrer to the Second and Third Causes of Action and granted its motion
to strike references to punitive damages. Plaintiff was granted a 30-day leave
to amend. (1/4/24 Minute Order.) Subsequently, no amendments were filed by Plaintiff,
and State Farm filed its Answer to the Complaint on February 8, 2024.
 
On July 24, 2024, State Farm filed the instant Motion to Compel
Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One (the “Motion”).
 
            No
Opposition or Reply papers have been received by the Court.
 
ANALYSIS
 
“If a party to
whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and for a monetary
sanction. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) The statute contains no
time limit for a motion to compel where no responses have been served. All that
needs to be shown in the moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was
properly served on the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired,
and that no response of any kind has been served. (Leach v. Superior Court
(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905-906.)
 
Additionally,
“[i]f a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely
response ... [t]he party to whom the interrogatories are directed waives any
right to exercise the option to produce writings under Section 2030.230, as
well as any objection to the interrogatories, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product...” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(a).)
 
A.   
Motion to
Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One
Defendant State Farm’s
counsel, Robert Kubler (“Kubler”), attests that on April 29, 2024, Plaintiff Brent
was served with the first set of Special Interrogatories (“SROG”) by U.S. mail.
(Kubler Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. “B.”)  This
service established that responses were due on June 3, 2024, including the five-day
extension applicable to the service method. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260, 1013.)
No responses were received by June 5, 2024. (Kubler Decl. ¶ 6.) Kubler then
sent a letter to Plaintiff’s counsel, Thomas M. Bundy (“Bundy”), requesting
responses to be served within 7 days. (Ibid.) However, as of June 25,
2024, State Farm had not received any responses to the SROG. (Kubler Decl. ¶
8.)
Based on the above records, the
Court determines that Plaintiff Brent failed to serve a timely response,
thereby waiving any objection to the interrogatories, including those based on
privilege or protection for work product, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2030.290, subdivision (a).
 
Nevertheless, under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (a), “[t]he court, on motion, may
relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the
following conditions are satisfied: ¶ (1) The party has subsequently served a
response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220,
2030.230, and 2030.240. ¶ (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.”
 
Here, Plaintiff Brent did
not file an Opposition to the Motion. Nor did he move separately for relief
from the waiver. Additionally, there is no record indicating any responses have
been subsequently served by Brent prior to the hearing. Consequently, the Court
finds that relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290,
subdivision(a) is unavailable in this circumstance.
Based on the foregoing,
the Court GRANTS the unopposed Motion.
CONCLUSION
 
Defendant State Farm Mutual
Automobile Insurance Company’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff Larry Brent’s Responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set One, is GRANTED.
 
Plaintiff
Larry Brent is ordered to serve verified responses, without objection, to the Special
Interrogatories, Set One, within 20 days.
 
Moving party to give notice.
