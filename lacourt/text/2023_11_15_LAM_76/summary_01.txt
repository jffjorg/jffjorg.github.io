And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for sanctions filed by Plaintiff Jacquelin Brenda Ramirez against Defendant Mother's Nutritional Center, Inc. and its counsel, Robert Orozco. The motion was brought in connection with a previous motion to compel further responses to interrogatories, which the court granted in part and denied in part on April 10, 2023. The court has granted the motion for sanctions in part, ordering Defendant and its counsel to pay $1,710 to Plaintiff for attorney's fees incurred in connection with the motion. The court has denied the remainder of the motion for sanctions. The judge notes that the failure to respond to interrogatories was not propounded upon Defendant Jasmine Fajardo, so her disappearance is not relevant to this sanction.
