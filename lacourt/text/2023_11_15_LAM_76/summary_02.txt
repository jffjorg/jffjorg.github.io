The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel arbitration and stay action. The motion has been filed by the defendants, Classic Distributing Beverage Group, LLC, Classic Distributing and Beverage Group, Inc., Classic Beverage of Southern California, LLC, Joe Hwang, and John Morales.

The judge has concluded that the defendants' motion to compel arbitration is GRANTED. The litigation is ordered stayed pending arbitration.

The judge has found that an agreement exists between the parties whereby the plaintiff agreed to submit all of the claims asserted against all of the defendants in his complaint to mandatory arbitration. The burden shifts to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the arbitration agreement should not be enforced.

The judge has also found that the arbitration agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and that it provides for neutral arbitrators, adequate discovery, written awards, all types of relief available in court, and does not require employees to pay unreasonable costs or fees.

The judge has considered the plaintiff's argument that the agreement is unconscionable, but has found that it is not substantively unconscionable. The judge has also found that the class action waiver in the agreement is enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act.

The parties are ordered to meet and confer to agree upon the arbitral forum. If the parties are unable to agree, the defendants may request a hearing to resolve the dispute. Regardless of the forum, the defendants will bear all costs of arbitration and the arbitrator's fees.
