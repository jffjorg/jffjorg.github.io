ANALYSIS 
Motion For Sanctions 
On April 10, 2023, the Court granted in part and
denied in part Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses as to Plaintiffs’
motion to compel further responses to interrogatories from Defendant Mother’s
Nutritional Center, Inc., and as to this motion only, the Court denied the request
for sanctions without prejudice to a separately-noticed sanctions motion. (See
April 10, 2023 minute order.) As such, the Court will only consider the request
for sanctions as to this motion. The only form interrogatory at issue in that
motion was form interrogatory – general No. 12.1. The reasonable amount of
attorney’s fees incurred in connection with that motion and this sanctions
motion is $775 (3 hours at $550/hour—Joshua M. Mohrsaz Decl,. ¶ 33), plus a$60
filing fee, for a total of $1,710. The request for sanctions is against
Defendant Mother’s Nutritional Center, Inc. and its counsel of record Robert
Orozco, jointly and severally. This set of interrogatories was not propounded
upon Defendant Jasmine Fajardo, so her disappearance is not relevant to this
sanction.
The remainder of the motion for sanction is DENIED.
