As for the summary in English text, here is a brief summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge grants the motion to quash service of summons filed by LoginRadius, Inc. (the defendant) on the grounds that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over the defendant. The court finds that there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that the defendant has purposefully availed itself of California as a forum or that it has minimum contacts with the state. The court also declines to impose alter ego liability on the defendant. The judge notes that the plaintiff (Deepak Gupta) has failed to meet his burden of showing that the defendant has purposefully availed itself of California as a forum.
