And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering whether the defendant, Moving Party, has purposeful availment of California's jurisdiction. The judge notes that Moving Party contracts with WeWork, which has offices in California, but this is not enough to establish jurisdiction. The judge also notes that Plaintiff's claim is unrelated to Moving Party's contacts in California. The judge is not persuaded that Moving Party's alleged assistance in Plaintiff's relocation to California, or its filing of taxes and holding a bank account in California, is sufficient to establish purposeful availment. The judge is also skeptical of Plaintiff's unsigned "offer of employment" with LoginRadius USA, Inc., which includes an arbitration clause. The judge suggests that it may be inequitable to hail Moving Party to this forum because its employee, Plaintiff, moved to California and it accommodated his request, but ultimately decides not to analyze agency between the two corporations.
