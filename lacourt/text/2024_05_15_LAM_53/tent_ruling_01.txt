  Order RE:
 
defendant’s motion to compel further
  responses to requests for admission and for sanctions
 



 
MOVING PARTIES:              Defendant and cross-complainant
Mulgrew Aircraft Components, Inc., and defendant Mohammad Houshiar                        
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Plaintiff David Maijala
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Admission and for
Sanctions
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Defendant and cross-complainant Mulgrew Aircraft Components, Inc., and
defendant Mohammad Houshiar (“Houshiar”) (“Defendants”) move the court for an
order (1) compelling plaintiff David Maijala (“Plaintiff”) to serve further
responses to Houshiar’s Requests for Admission, Set One, numbers 3, 6, 7, and
8, and (2) awarding monetary sanctions in favor of Defendants and against
Plaintiff in the amount of $1,500.
The court denies Houshiar’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s further
response to Request for Admission, number 3 because the objections to that
request are not without merit since that request seeks information that (1) is
not relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action, and is not
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, and (2) is
protected by Plaintiff’s right to privacy in his personnel records in his
former employment relationships.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (a)(2), 2017.010.) 
The court denies Houshiar’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s further
responses to Requests for Admission, numbers 6, 7, and 8 because the objections
to those requests are not without merit since those requests seek information
that is protected by Plaintiff’s right to privacy in his personnel records in
his former employment relationships. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (a)(2).) 
The court denies Defendants’ request for monetary sanctions against
Plaintiff.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.290, subd. (d).) 
ORDER
            The court denies defendant and
cross-complainant Mulgrew Aircraft Components, Inc., and defendant Mohammad
Houshiar’s motion to compel further responses to requests for admission and for
sanctions.
            The court orders plaintiff David
Maijala to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
