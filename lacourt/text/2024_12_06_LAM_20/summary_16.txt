And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a employment action case, where the plaintiff, Kathleen Sullivan, is seeking damages for extreme mental and emotional distress caused by the defendant's conduct. The defendant is seeking to compel a mental exam of the plaintiff to gather evidence. The judge has granted the motion in part, limiting the mental exam to 7 hours, not including breaks, and permitting inquiry into the plaintiff's sex life with her husband. The judge has also balanced the plaintiff's right to privacy with the defendant's right to discovery, allowing questions about the plaintiff's sex life for the limited purpose of exploring the plaintiff's statement about a "lack of sex drive" caused by the defendant's misconduct.
