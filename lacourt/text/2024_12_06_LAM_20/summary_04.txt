And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in response to a motion to quash a deposition notice filed by defendant Symrise, Inc. The plaintiff, Roland Esparza, had filed a second amended complaint alleging that he developed a serious lung condition due to the use of butter spray manufactured, distributed, or sold by the defendants. Esparza had sought to take a preservation deposition, which was granted by the court in November 2024. Symrise now seeks to quash the deposition notice and delay the deposition, citing concerns about the sequencing of the deposition. However, the court finds that Symrise fails to justify its request and that the deposition should proceed as originally scheduled. The judge rules that Esparza's preservation deposition will move forward, and that defense counsel may question him after he has provided his preservation testimony. The motion to quash is denied, and Symrise is ordered to give notice of the ruling.
