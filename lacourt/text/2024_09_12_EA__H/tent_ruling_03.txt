Introduction In  2022, following a burglary at the Karlin home involving the theft of a large  sum of cash, a criminal court issued an order requiring offender David Escoto  to pay restitution in the amount of $129,660 to Theresa Karlin, Petitioner’s  wife(Bassirian Decl., ¶ 3, Exh. 1; Karlin  Decl. ¶ 3.) Theresa Karlin passed away in 2012. Following her death, the  California Victim Compensation Board (the “Board”) initially continued to issue  checks to Petitioner by manually changing the name on the check to Petitioner’s  name, rather than Theresa Karlin. (Karlin Decl., ¶ 4.) However, Petitioner was  informed in 2021 that the Board’s legal division had determined it did not have  legal authority to change the names on checks received from the California  Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. (Id.) The balance owed  under the restitution order is $109,000. (Id. ¶ 3.) Petitioner now  petitions this Court for an order  modifying the beneficiary of the restitution order issued in Case No. KA057115,  a 2002 criminal matter against Escoto, so that Petitioner is the beneficiary,  rather than Theresa Karlin.   Legal Standard “[I]n every case in which a victim has suffered economic  loss as a result of the [criminal] defendant’s conduct, the court shall require  that the defendant make restitution to the victim or victims in an amount  established by court order, based on the amount of loss claimed by the victim  or victims or any other showing to the court” (Pen. Code § 1202.4, subd. (f).) “A  restitution order imposed pursuant to subdivision (f) shall be enforceable  as if the order were a civil judgment.” (Pen. Code § 1202.4, subd. (i).)“[T]rial courts have  the authority to deem restitution orders money judgments. The plain  language of section 1214 equates a restitution order to a civil judgment  and articulates how such orders can be enforced within the criminal courts, but  if a civil court is asked to convert such a restitution order into a civil  judgment, . . . it is not error for it to do so.” (Nationwide Ins. Co. of  America v. Tipton (2023) 91 Cal.App.5th 1355, 1358; see also People v.  Harvest (2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 641, 647 [i.e., “(V)ictim restitution is a  civil remedy which does not require a criminal forum The governing statutes  specify that an order for victim restitution may originate from criminal court,  but expressly recognize that such an order shall be enforceable as a civil  judgment. It therefore contemplates that subsequent enforcement efforts may  occur outside the context of the criminal law.” (quotations and citations  omitted)].)   Discussion In support of his  petition, Petitioner has submitted a declaration from Petitioner, a copy of the  email he received from the Board, a copy of Theresa Karlin’s death certificate,  and a copy of the October 22, 2022 order in Case No. KA057115 requiring Escoto  to pay restitution in the amount of $129,660.00. (Bassirian Decl., ¶ 3, Exh. 1;  Karlin Decl. ¶¶¶ 5, 6, 7, Exhs. 1-3.) However, before ruling on the petition, the  Court would like additional information about Theresa Karlin’s estate and  whether there are other individuals who may have an interest in the restitution  order. Specifically, the Court requests that Petitioner advise the Court (1)  whether or not a probate was ever opened for Theresa Karlin’s estate and, if  so, the disposition of that estate, (2) whether anyone other than Petitioner  would have any interest in Theresa Karlin’s restitution order, and (3) whether Theresa  Karlin ever assigned or left her interest in the restitution order to anyone  other than Petitioner.Accordingly, the  Court will continue the hearing on the petition to November 15, 2024, at  8:30 a.m. Petitioner is directed to file and serve his supplemental brief  addressing the foregoing issues by no later than November 1, 2024.  Counsel for Petitioner is to provide notice.
