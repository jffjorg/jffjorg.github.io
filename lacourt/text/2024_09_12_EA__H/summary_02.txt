And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a future Court Hearing. The Moving Defendants have requested summary adjudication on 18 separate issues. The Judge is considering the dispute over the Business Purpose of a loan, specifically whether the Moving Defendants inserted a new provision in the Promissory Note that advises that changing the Business Purpose is an event of default. The Judge notes that the $170,000 Note includes a provision that states that changing the Business Purpose is an event of default, and that the HOEPA law requires lenders to make additional disclosures to borrowers of "high-cost" or "high-rate" loans. The Judge is considering the evidence presented and will issue a final ruling at a later date.
