 Case Number:  KS021326    Hearing Date:   September 12, 2024    Dept:  H The Court is
inclined to grant the Motion for Distribution to Funds on Deposit with the
Court, filed by Claimant Celeste Osborne, Administrator and Heir to the Estate
of Ernest Osborne. At the hearing on September 12, 2024, the Court
requests that Claimant’s Counsel address whether notice was provided to
the lienholders of the three liens identified in Attachment 11b to the Petition
Filed by MTC Financial Inc.
 
Background
On
May 30, 2018, MTC Financial Inc. (“MTC”) filed a “Petition and Declaration
Regarding Unresolved Claims and Deposit of Undistributed Surplus Proceeds of
Trustee’s Sale” (“Petition”). MTC was the trustee under the deed of trust
executed on April 19, 2006 and recorded on April 25, 2006 which encumbered the
real property commonly known as 1525 Rama Drive in La Puente (the “subject
property”). The subject property was the subject of a trustee’s sale that was
held on September 21, 2016. MTC’s Petition sought a determination of claims to
surplus proceeds. 
On
June 8, 2018, an “Order to Deposit Surplus Proceeds Pursuant to Civil Code §
2924j(c) & (d)” (“June 8, 2018 Order”) was entered.
On
July 2, 2018, a “Notice of Deposit” was filed, wherein MTC advised that it had
submitted the surplus proceeds deposit of $30,969.29 pursuant to the Court’s
June 8, 2018 Order.
On
October 3, 2018, the Court ordered that surplus proceeds in the amount of
$30,969.29 remain deposited with the superior court until such time as they are
ordered part of the trial court operations fund per Government Code § 68084.1
or escheated to the State.

Discussion 
Claimant
Celeste Osborne, Successor In Interest and Administrator to Estate of Ernest
Osborne (“Claimant”), moves for an order distributing the funds on deposit with
the Court in the amount of $30,969.29.
Request
for Judicial Notice
Turning
first to Claimant’s Request for Judicial Notice, a court may take judicial
notice “of official acts of the legislative, executive, and judicial
departments of a state and of facts and propositions that are not reasonably
subject to dispute and are capable of immediate and accurate determination by
resort to sources of reasonably indisputable accuracy.” People v. Terry,
38 Cal. App. 3d 432, 439, 113 Cal. Rptr. 233, 237 (Ct. App. 1974) [citing Evid.
Code §
452].)
With
that standard in mind, the Court grants the request for judicial notice as to: Exhibit
2 (Joint Tenancy Grant Deed recorded July 11, 1984 and Affidavit—Death of Joint
Tenant recorded December 3, 2012); Exhibit 5 (Certificate of Death for Ernest
Osborne); and Exhibit 6 (“Petition and Declaration Regarding Unresolved Claims
and Deposit of Undistributed Surplus Proceeds of Trustee’s Sale” filed May 30,
2018 in this case). The Court denies the request for judicial notice as to:
Exhibit 1 (page entitled “Search for Unclaimed Property” taken from http://www.sco.ca.gov/search_upd.html);
Exhibit 3 (Declaration of Claimant); Exhibit 4 (Copy of Claimant’s California
driver’s license); and Exhibit 7 (Declaration of David M. Brandon, Esq.).


Claimant’s
Motion        
Civil
Code section 2924k(a), which governs the priority in which claimants must be
paid after a foreclosure sale, provides that the proceeds be distributed in the
following order: “(1) To the costs and expenses of exercising the power of sale
and of sale . . . (2) To the payment of the obligations secured by the deed of
trust or mortgage which is the subject of the trustee’s sale. (3) To satisfy
the outstanding balance of obligations secured by any junior liens or
encumbrances in the order of their priority. (4) To the trustor or the trustor’s
successor in interest. In the event property is sold or transferred to another,
to the vested owner of record at the time of the trustee’s sale.”
Passage
of property to the state by escheat is “not favored by the law and is ‘to be
avoided wherever possible.’” (Estate of Johnson (1984) 162 Cal.App.3d
917, 921.) Code of Civil Procedure section 1351 provides that “all money or
other property deposited in the State Treasury under the provisions of this
title, if not claimed by the person entitled thereto within five years from the
date of such deposit, shall become the property of the State by escheat”
pursuant to proceedings commenced under Code of Civil Procedure section 1410.
The Court maintains
ancillary jurisdiction to distribute funds on deposit. (Lord v. Superior
Court of Los Angeles County (1946) 27 Cal.2d 855.) Further,
“[j]urisdiction of the court over the parties and the subject matter of an
action continues throughout subsequent proceedings in the action.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 410.50, subd. (b).) 
Here,
Claimant is the biological daughter and sole heir of Ernest Osborne, who passed
away in 2015. Ernest Osborne was the owner of the subject property before the
foreclosure sale and the only person listed on the title to the subject
property. Ernest Osborne was widowed when he died and had no will, and there
are no pending probate petitions in this jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction
regarding Ernest Osborne. (Claimant Decl., ¶¶ 1-5; Request for Judicial Notice (“RJN”),
Exhs. 2, 5.) Accordingly, Claimant is a successor in interest and administrator
of Ernest Osborne’s estate, as defined in Probate Code section 13006.  
Following
the foreclosure sale in 2016, $30,969.29 in proceeds remaining from the
foreclosure sale were deposited with the Court. (Claimant Decl., ¶ 7.) There is
no evidence that any escheat proceedings have taken place pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 1410, and there is no indication that the superior
court has escheated the funds and published notice pursuant to Government Code
section 68084.1. subdivision (a). In fact, the funds remain on deposit with the
superior court. (Brandon Decl., ¶ 2.)
No
opposition has been filed by any entities and/or individuals listed on the
accompanying proof of service.
Based
on the foregoing facts, the Court is inclined to grant the petition. That said, at the hearing on September 12, 2024, the Court requests that Claimant’s
counsel address whether notice of MTC’s
petition was provided to certain lienholders referenced in Attachment 11b to
the Petition and if not, its bearing (if any) on the instant motion. Specifically,
counsel should address whether notice was provided to the lienholders of the following
three liens identified in Attachment 11b to the Petition: (1) lien recorded
November 28, 1989 as Instrument No. 89 1902708 naming
Barclays American/Financial, Inc., a North Carolina Corporation as beneficiary,
(2) lien recorded on April 16, 2002 as Instrument No. 02 0888278 naming Deborah
Russell, an unmarried woman as to an undivided 100.00000000% interest as
beneficiary and (3) lien recorded April 16, 2022 as Instrument No. 02 0888279
naming Sandy Cape Management L.L.C. as to an undivided 100.00000000% interest
as beneficiary). (See RJN Exh. 6). Although the Court’s October 3, 2018 ruling
states that “[t]he Trustee has identified the following potential claimants: 1)
Secretary of Housing and Urban Development; and 2) prior owner, Ernest Osborne;
and 3) three liens recorded on the property” and that “[a]ll potential
claimants were given notice of the surplus funds,” the proof of service
accompanying the Petition does not reflect that service of the Petition was
made on the aforementioned lienholders.
