And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of In re Donald Karlin, Case No. 24PSCP00070. The hearing on Petitioner Don Karlin's Amended Petition to Modify Victim Restitution is continued to November 15, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Petitioner is directed to file a supplemental brief by November 1, 2024, addressing three issues: whether a probate was opened for Theresa Karlin's estate and the disposition of that estate; whether anyone other than Petitioner would have any interest in the restitution order; and whether Theresa Karlin ever assigned or left her interest in the restitution order to anyone other than Petitioner. The case involves a burglary at the Karlin home in 2022, resulting in the theft of a large sum of cash, and the issuance of a restitution order in the amount of $129,660 to Theresa Karlin, Petitioner's wife. After Theresa Karlin's death in 2012, the California Victim Compensation Board continued to issue checks to Petitioner, but the Board's legal division determined it did not have legal authority to change the names on checks. The balance owed under the restitution order is $109,000.
