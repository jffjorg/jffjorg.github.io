```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is inclined to grant the motion for distribution of funds on deposit with the court in the amount of $30,969.29. The funds were deposited with the court after a foreclosure sale in 2016. The claimant, Celeste Osborne, is the administrator and heir to the estate of Ernest Osborne, who passed away in 2015. The court has jurisdiction to distribute the funds and has not escheated them to the state. The court requests that claimant's counsel address whether notice was provided to certain lienholders referenced in Attachment 11b to the petition, specifically lienholders who have not been served with notice of the petition. The court's request is due to the lack of evidence that notice was provided to these lienholders.
