[FN1] Specifically, Moving Defendants
alternatively request summary adjudication as to 18 separate issues, as
outlined in their moving papers.


[FN2] Judge Hernandez, on that same
date, granted Moving Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment as to C. Wang.


[FN3] The Moving Defendants are not
named in the second and eight causes action, which were brought against Lin,
First American, and Does 1 through 60.


[FN4] K. Wang asserts that Moving
Defendants inserted a “brand new provision” in Paragraph 3 of the second
Promissory Note, reading:
            “3. Business Purpose
This is a Business Purpose loan. The proceeds is to
payoff existing junior loans resulted from prior business transactions.” 
The
$170,000 Note (Cheung Decl., ¶ 18, Exh. 11), however, advises under Paragraph 8
“Events of Default,” that “You will be in default under this Agreement if any
of the following events occurs: a) if you change the Business Purpose of the
loan.”


[FN5] The fourth cause of action was not asserted against BB Wells, so the
Court’s analysis as to this cause of action pertains only as to Cheung and
Protec.


[FN6] HOEPA “requires lenders to make
additional disclosures to borrowers of ‘high-cost’ or ‘high-rate’ loans.”
