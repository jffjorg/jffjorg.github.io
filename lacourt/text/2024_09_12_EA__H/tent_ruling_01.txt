  Case Number:  19PSCV00586    Hearing Date:   September 12, 2024    Dept:  H Wang
v. BB Wells Investment Inc., et al. (19PSCV00586)


ORDER
Defendants James Cheung’s, BB Wells
Investment Inc.’s and Protec Investment Inc.’s Motion for Summary Judgment is
GRANTED. 
 
Background
Plaintiff Kirby Wang Wang (“K. Wang”) alleges as
follows:

K. Wang and his mom, Cher Wang
(“C. Wang”), had been the owners of the property located at 24332 Delta Drive,
Diamond Bar, CA (the “subject property”) since 1989. In about July 2017, K.
Wang fell behind on his first mortgage loan with Wells Fargo. There were 5
loans on the subject property at that time; the first two were with Wells Fargo
and the latter three were with private lenders. K. Wang wanted to reinstate the
first loan and pay off the third, fourth, and fifth loans. In 2017, K. Wang was
introduced by Ginny Lin (“Lin”), an acquaintance and real estate agent, to
James Cheung (“Cheung”). Cheung is a hard money lender and the principal of
Protec Investment Inc. (“Protec”). Cheung
agreed to lend K. Wang a $170,000 loan at 18% annual interest, all due within
one year and secured by the subject property.  In about September 2017, K. Wang signed a real estate
listing agreement with Faith Global Realty Group, a company that belonged to
Lin, for about $980,000.00. Lin suggested that K. Wang should sell the subject
property due to the loan maturity and to avoid default and foreclosure. Lin
never procured any acceptable offers. When the $170,000 loan matured on about
July 17, 2018, Cheung demanded $250,000.00 from K. Wang to pay off the loan. In
the fall of 2018, Cheung told C. Wang
that Cheung and Protec would reduce the interest rate from 18% to 9%; no
documents were provided reflecting this change, however. On October 18, 2018, Cheung recorded an assignment of the
deed of trust to BB Wells Investment Inc. (“BB Wells”), a company Cheung
controls. The assignment was signed by Cheung as President of Protec, even
though Protec had already been dissolved. On November 15, 2018, a Notice of
Default was recorded. On May 10, 2019, BB Wells foreclosed on the subject
property. BB Wells subsequently filed an unlawful detainer action against
K. Wang and his father, who were forced to vacate the subject property in July
2019. During the unlawful detainer case, a second promissory note with
different language and a different interest rate was produced. K. Wang had
never seen or signed the second promissory note and believes the first page of
the first and second promissory notes were swapped.On June 27, 2019, K. Wang and C. Wang brought this
lawsuit against BB Wells, Protec, and Cheung. In their initial complaint, the
plaintiffs asserted several causes of action in connection with the $170,000
loan, including negligent and reckless misrepresentations, constructive fraud, and
unfair business practices. On July 31, 2019, BB Wells filed a cross-complaint,
asserting causes of action against K. Wang, C. Wang, and Roes 1-100 for
declaratory relief and abuse of process. On April 8, 2021, K. Wang filed a First Amended
Complaint (the “Operative Complaint” or “FAC”), asserting causes of action
against BB Wells, Protec, Cheung, Lin, First American Financial & Investment
Corp. (“First American”), and Does 1-60 for: 
1.       Fraud
(against all defendants and Does 1-60);
2.       Constructive
Fraud (against Lin, First American, and Does 1-60);
3.       Conspiracy
to Commit Fraud (against all defendants and Does 1-60);
4.       Negligent
Misrepresentation (against Cheung, Protec, and Does 1-60);
5.       Violation
of Federal Truth in Lending Act (against Cheung, Protec, BB Wells, and Does
1-60);
6.       Rescission
(against Cheung, Protec, BB Wells, and Does 1-60);
7.       Wrongful
Foreclosure (against Cheung, BB Wells, Protec, and Does 1-60);
8.       Breach
of Fiduciary Duty (against Lin, First American, and Does 1-60); and
9.       Unfair
Business Practices (against all defendants and Does 1-60). On September 27, 2023, Protec and Cheung filed a
First Amended Cross-Complaint asserting causes of action against K. Wang and
Does 1-10 for fraud or deceit based on intentional misrepresentations, fraud or
deceit based on concealment, fraud or deceit based on false promises, fraud or
deceit based on negligent misrepresentations, breach of contract, and breach of
the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The Final Status Conference is set for October 1
2024. Trial is set for October 15, 2024. Pending before the Court is Cheung, BB Wells, and
Protec’s motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication.
For the reasons stated herein, the Court grants the motion for summary judgment.  
Legal Standard“A party may move for summary judgment. . . if it is
contended that the action has no merit or that there is no defense to the
action or proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (a)(1).) “The motion for summary judgment shall be granted if
all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material
fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).)“On
a motion for summary judgment[/adjudication], the initial burden is always on
the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no triable issues
of material fact.” (Scalf v. D.B. Log
Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) “A plaintiff or cross-complainant
has met his or her burden of showing that there is no defense to a cause of
action if that party has proved each element of the cause of action entitling
the party to judgment on the cause of action. Once the plaintiff or
cross-complainant has met that burden, the burden shifts to the defendant or
cross-defendant to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts
exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
437c, subd. (p)(1).) “A defendant or
cross-defendant has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has
no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of
action. . . cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to the
cause of action. Once the defendant. . . has met that burden, the burden shifts
to the plaintiff or cross-complainant to show that a triable issue of one or
more material facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd.
(p)(2).)
Discussion Cheung, BB
Wells and Protec (together, “Moving Defendants”) move the Court for summary
judgment in their favor and against K. Wang as to all causes of action and
claims for damages in the Operative Complaint brought against Moving
Defendants. In the alternative, Moving Defendants seek summary adjudication that
there is no merit to the causes of action brought against Moving Defendants.[FN1] 
Prior Motion for Summary Judgment/Adjudication  At the outset, the Court has been made aware through
the parties’ briefing that on February 9, 2021, the previously assigned judge (The
Honorable Peter Hernandez) denied Moving Defendants’ Motion for Summary
Judgment as to K. Wang, denied Moving Defendants’ Motion for Summary
Adjudication as to all but one issue, and granted Moving Defendants’ Motion for
Summary Adjudication as to one issue.[FN2] Moving Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment or, Alternatively, Summary Adjudication
as to K. Wang was directed at the causes of action in the original complaint
filed June 27, 2019, which asserted causes of action for (1)
Misrepresentations, (2) Constructive Fraud, (3) Voiding of Contract, (4) Unfair
Business Practices, (5) Accounting and (6) Quieting Title to Real Property.While not specifically referenced by either party,
the Court is mindful that “[a] party shall not move for summary
judgment based on issues asserted in a prior motion for summary adjudication
and denied by the court unless that party establishes, to the satisfaction of
the court, newly discovered facts or circumstances or a change of law supporting
the issues reasserted in the summary judgment motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
437c, subd. (f)(2).)The instant motion is directed at the Operative
Complaint filed April 8, 2021, which was filed pursuant to stipulation and
asserted causes of action for (1) Fraud, (2) Constructive Fraud, (3) Conspiracy
to Commit Fraud, (4) Negligent Misrepresentation, (5) Violation of Federal
Truth in Lending Act, (6) Rescission, (7) Wrongful Foreclosure, (8) Breach of
Fiduciary Duty and (9) Unfair Business Practices; the second and eighth causes
of action are not asserted against Moving Defendants and the fourth cause of
action is asserted against Cheung and Protec only. The Court has reviewed Judge Hernandez’s February 9,
2021 ruling, as well as the Notice of Motion filed July 7, 2020 with respect to
Moving Defendants’ prior Motion for Summary Judgment or, Alternatively, Summary
Adjudication. The Court determines that Moving Defendants’ instant motion does
not violate the restrictions set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 437c,
subdivision (f)(2), notwithstanding the fact that both the original complaint
and the Operative Complaint contain causes of action for fraud, negligent
misrepresentation, rescission/voiding of contract and unfair business
practices, because Judge Hernandez elected to treat the previous motion as a
motion for judgment on the pleadings with respect to these causes of action.
(See Page 6 [“All these contentions essentially argue that the pleading are
[sic] insufficient to put Defendants on notice as to the claim alleged against
them. Thus, this argument is equivalent to a demurrer or a motion for judgment
on the pleadings. Thus, the court shall treat this issue as a motion for
judgment on the pleadings rather than a motion for summary judgment. . .”]; see
also, Page 7 [“Defendants reiterate the arguments made above for the First and
Second Causes of Action. However, the court already address this [sic] as not a
sufficient basis to grant summary judgment, and instead allowed Plaintiffs to
correct this defect. Thus, the court will grant Plaintiffs an opportunity to
correct this defect. . .;” and “Defendants contend that this cause of action
‘piggybacks’ on the same causes of action discussed above. . . The court has
already addressed these other issues by denying summary adjudication on them. .
.”].) Accordingly, the Court will proceed to the merits of
the motion.  
Opposing Separate Statement The Court observes that K. Wang’s opposing separate
statement does not comply with California Rules of Court rule 3.1350,
subdivision (f), which provides, in relevant part, as follows:“The Separate Statement in Opposition
to Motion must be in the two-column format specified in (h).
(1)      Each
material fact claimed by the moving party to be undisputed must be set out
verbatim on the left side of the page, below which must be set out the
evidence said by the moving party to establish that fact, complete with the
moving party's references to exhibits.

(2)      On
the right side of the page, directly opposite the recitation of the moving
party's statement of material facts and supporting evidence, the response must
unequivocally state whether that fact is ‘disputed’ or ‘undisputed.’ An
opposing party who contends that a fact is disputed must state,
on the right side of the page directly opposite the fact in dispute, the
nature of the dispute and describe the evidence that supports the
position that the fact is controverted. Citation to the evidence in support
of the position that a fact is controverted must include reference to the
exhibit, title, page, and line numbers. . .” (Emphasis added). K. Wang purports to “dispute” material
fact nos. 6, 11, 20, 21, 26, 32, 35, 44, 46, 53, 59, 62, 63, 65, 66, 67, 69,
76, 77, 82, 85, 87, 89, 91, 93, 96, 98, 100, 102, 105, 108 and 110-112, but
fails to identify the nature of the dispute. Additionally, while K. Wang
purports to “dispute” material fact nos. 16-18 (and part of no. 27), he fails
to cite to any supporting evidence. K. Wang also fails to cite Moving
Defendants’ evidence in the left-hand column of his opposing separate
statement. Next, the Court notes that K. Wang’s opposing
separate statement contains evidentiary objections, which is improper.
California Rules of Court rule 3.1354 expressly states that “objections must
not be restated or reargued in the separate statement.” (See also, Hodjat v.
State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co. (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 1, 9 [“interposing objections into the separate statement defeats the
goal of allowing the trial court to quickly and efficiently determine what
particular piece of evidence is admitted and what is not”].) The Court declines to consider
any evidentiary objections contained in K. Wang’s opposing separate statement
on this basis. 
Request for Judicial Notice Accompanying Moving Defendants’ motion is a Request
for Judicial Notice. A court may take judicial notice of,
among other things, “official acts of the legislative, executive, and judicial
departments of a state and of facts and propositions that are not reasonably
subject to dispute and are capable of immediate and accurate determination by
resort to sources of reasonably indisputable accuracy.” People v. Terry,
38 Cal. App. 3d 432, 439, 113 Cal. Rptr. 233, 237 (Ct. App. 1974) [citing Evid.
Code §
452].) With this standard in mind, the Court grants Moving Defendants’ Request for
Judicial Notice and takes judicial notice of Exhibit Nos. 1, 2, 15, 18, 20-24,
31, 34, 36-43, 48, 53, 57, 59 and 60.  
Evidentiary Objections 
The Court rules on the parties’ evidentiary
objections as follows: 
As to K. Wang’s evidentiary
objections to Cheung’s declaration, the Court overrules the objections as to
Nos 1-9, 11, 13-17 and No. 10 (except as to “. . . and Note was signed in front
of a travel notary I arranged. . .”) and sustains the objections to part of No.
10 (i.e., as to “. . . and Note was signed in front of a travel notary I
arranged. . .”) and No. 12. As to Moving Defendants’
evidentiary objections to K. Wang’s declaration, the Court overrules the
objections as to Nos. 1-10 and sustains the objections as to No. 11. As to
Moving Defendants’ evidentiary objections to Lu’s declaration, the Court
sustains the objections as to Nos. 1-3 and as to third sentence of No. 4 and overrules
the objections as to No. 5 and first two sentences of No. 4. 
Merits                  Moving Defendants seek summary judgment as to every cause
of action brought against them in the Operative Complaint.[FN3] The Court addresses the causes of action in turn. 
First and Third Causes of Action (i.e., for Fraud
and Conspiracy to Commit Fraud, Respectively) “The elements of the tort of fraudulent
misrepresentation are: (1) representation; (2) falsity; (3) knowledge of
falsity; (4) intent to deceive; and (5) reliance and resulting damages
(causation).” (Cooper v. Equity Gen. Insurance (1990) 219 Cal.App.3d
1252, 1262.) “[T]he elements of an action for fraud
and deceit based on concealment are: (1) the defendant must have concealed or
suppressed a material fact, (2) the defendant must have been under a duty to
disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3) the defendant must have intentionally
concealed or suppressed the fact with the intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4)
the plaintiff must have been unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he
did if he had known of the concealed or suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of
the concealment or suppression of the fact, the plaintiff must have sustained
damage.” (Boschma v. Home Loan Center, Inc. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 230,
248 [quotations and citation omitted].)K. Wang’s first cause
of action is comprised of one count of fraudulent misrepresentation and one
count of fraud and deceit based on concealment. More specifically, K. Wang
first alleges that at the time Protec issued the $170,000.00 loan in July 2017,
Cheung represented to him that the only payment he would have to make was a
balloon payment after one year for a total of $200,600. (FAC, ¶ 34.) K. Wang
alleges that Cheung knew this statement was untrue at the time it was made, “as
evidenced by Defendants’ later demand of $259,507.71 in the Notice of Default
and $309,166.96 at the foreclosure sale,” and that K. Wang was unaware of the
falsity of the statement and relied on it, causing him damage. (Id.)K. Wang next alleges
that sometime between July 2017 and July 2020, Defendants secretly fabricated
the second Promissory Note with changed terms in Paragraphs 3-5, along with a
changed interest rate, without his knowledge or consent, even though they knew
they had a legal duty to disclose these changes to him. He further alleges that
he could not have discovered the suppression of these adverse material facts
despite care and diligence and that he suffered damages. (Id., ¶ 35.)Moving Defendants contend
that K. Wang cannot establish that Cheung’s statement in Paragraph 34 was false
at the time it was made. The Court agrees. It is undisputed that default on any
other senior or junior loan or payment of taxes was grounds for default
pursuant to Paragraph 8, subdivision (h) of the $170,000 Note (Moving Defendants’
Separate Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (“UMF”) No. 29); that changing
the business purpose of the loan was grounds for default pursuant to Paragraph
8, subdivision (a) of the $170,000 Note (UMF No. 29); that, in the event of
default, Protec could raise the annual percentage rate to 24% during the period
K. Wang was in default pursuant to Paragraph 9, subdivision (c) of the $170,000
Note and could sell the property pursuant to subdivision (d) (UMF No. 30); that
the Protec Deed of Trust (“DOT”) permitted Protec to protect the collateral for
the Protec DOT by making payments to senior lenders if K. Wang failed to do so
(UMF No. 31); that on February 1, 2018, Protec made a second payment to Wells
Fargo in the amount of $8,910 to bring the Wells Fargo first lien current after
K. Wang missed another two months of mortgage payments (UMF No. 33); that the
first lien Wells Fargo monthly payment was in excess of $4,000; that from July
2017 to May 2019 (a total of 22 months), K. Wang did not make any payment to
Wells Fargo but knew that Protec had made that foregoing payments to Wells
Fargo to prevent Wells Fargo from foreclosing on the property (UMF No. 34); and
that Cheung wired $37,302 to Wells Fargo on October 1, 2018 (UMF No. 45), which
Cheung represents was to stop the Wells Fargo Trustee’s Sale set for the
following day. (Cheung Decl., ¶ 42, Exh. 35.)Further, while K.
Wang purports to dispute material fact no. 32 (i.e., that “[o]n November 2,
2017, Plaintiff sent Cheung a text message informing him that Plaintiff was 3
months in arrears on the Wells Fargo loan, and he asked Protec to make the
payment. . .”), on the basis that it “misstates the document” (i.e., Moving
Defendants’ Exhibit 27), a review of Moving Defendants’ Exhibit 27 reflects a
text message exchange where K. Wang, at 11:11 a.m. on November 2, 2017, texted
Wells Fargo’s phone number, the loan number, and the property address before
stating “Amt is 12,399.63 without late fees which the rep said is ok to pay
first—thanks for your help we are gonna get an appraisal done in few days per
ginny and lower price as well ASAP.” This statement supports Moving Defendants’
material fact no. 32, particularly when read in light of the undisputed
material fact that the first lien Wells Fargo monthly payment was in excess of
$4,000. K. Wang, moreover,
does not explain the nature of his dispute as to material fact no. 35 (i.e.,
that “[i]n order to protect its security interest in the Property when
Plaintiff failed to make required payments to Wells Fargo, BB Wells as a junior
lien holder made mortgage payments to Wells Fargo for a total of approximately
$100,000. This is known as an ‘advance to senior debt,’ and the amount was
added to Plaintiff’s outstanding balance to Protec as allowed for under
Provision 3 of the Protec DOT”) or as to material fact no. 59 (i.e., that
“[t]he itemization as of May 10, 2019, shows that Plaintiff owed an outstanding
balance of $326,573 to BB Wells”). The foregoing evidence reflects that K. Wang’s
outstanding debt increased due to K. Wang’s failure to make payments. Moving Defendants
also assert that K. Wang cannot establish damages with respect to the second
Promissory Note. Again, the Court agrees. K. Wang never made any payments on
any loan and by the time BB Wells foreclosed on the second promissory note (the
10% note), it also could have foreclosed on the initial promissory note (the
18% note). While K. Wang contends that “the falsified 10 Percent Note ties in
to Defendants’ failure to comply with the Truth in Lending Act” (Opp.,
10:17-18)[FN4],
K. Wang’s Trust in Lending Act (“TILA”) cause of action fails, for the reasons
set forth below in the Court’s discussion of the fifth cause of action.Finally, K. Wang’s third cause of action likewise
fails, inasmuch as it is derivative of his failed first cause of action.  
Fourth Cause of Action (i.e., Negligent
Misrepresentation)[FN5]“The
elements of negligent misrepresentation are
(1) the misrepresentation of a
past or existing material fact, (2) without reasonable
ground for believing it to be true, (3) with intent to induce another’s reliance on the fact
misrepresented, (4) justifiable reliance
on the misrepresentation, and (5) resulting damage.”
(Apollo Capital Fund, LLC v. Roth Capital
Partners, LLC (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 226, 243.) K. Wang alleges, with
respect to the fourth cause of action, that Cheung “made an assertion of untrue
fact in that all Plaintiff had to pay was $170,000 plus interest at time of
maturity; that, when Defendants (i.e., Protec and Cheung only) made this
representation to him, they lacked reasonable ground for the belief, with an intent
to induce him to rely upon that representation; and that he, in fact, relied on
this representation by entering into the loan transaction to his detriment and
later faced an “exorbitant amount of charges” and was damaged. (FAC, ¶ 46.) Moving Defendants
assert that K. Wang cannot establish that Cheung’s statement in Paragraph 46
was made without a reasonable ground for believing it was true at the time it
was made. The Court agrees for the same reasons set forth above as to the
fraudulent misrepresentation action.   
Fifth Cause of Action (i.e., for Violation of Federal
Truth in Lending Act [“TILA”]) K. Wang asserts that Moving Defendants violated TILA
by failing to make certain disclosures and provide certain documents to him
“before [he] undertook the loan transaction with CHEUNG and PROTEC.” (FAC, ¶ 55.)As an initial matter, the Court notes that it is
undisputed that pursuant to paragraph 8, subdivision a, of the $170,000 Note,
changing the business purpose of the loan was a ground for default. (UMF
No. 29.) It thus appears that the $170,000 Note is not subject to TILA at all.
(See, e.g., Mauro v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. (E.D.N.Y. 2010) 727
F.Supp.2d 145, 155 [loans for business purposes are exempt from TILA
coverage].)Even if it were assumed that the loan to K. Wang was
a consumer loan, Moving Defendants assert that they are entitled to
adjudication of this cause of action in their favor because, inter alia, they
are not “creditors” under TILA. The Court agrees. Section 1602(g) of Title 15 of
the United States Code provides, in relevant part, that “[t]he term ‘creditor’ refers only to a person who both (1) regularly extends, whether in
connection with loans, sales of property or services, or otherwise, consumer
credit which is payable by agreement in more than four installments or for
which the payment of a finance charge is or may be required, and (2) is the
person to whom the debt arising from the consumer credit transaction is
initially payable on the face of the evidence of indebtedness or, if there is
no such evidence of indebtedness, by agreement.” It further provides that “[a]ny
person who originates 2 or more
mortgages . . . in any 12-month period or any person who originates 1 or more
such mortgages through a mortgage broker shall be considered to be a creditor.”
15 U.S.C. § 1602(g). It is undisputed that
Cheung did not individually extend credit of any kind in 2016 nor 2017. (UMF
No. 22.) It is also undisputed that BB Wells, a California corporation
incorporated in 2017, did not extend credit of any kind in 2016 or 2017 and had
no involvement of any kind with K. Wang until June 2018, when K. Wang entered
into an Equity Purchase Agreement with BB Wells. (UMF No. 23.) Further, K. Wang
does not explain the nature of his dispute as to material fact nos. 20 (i.e.,
“Protec was a California corporation incorporated in 1989. Protec did not
regularly extend consumer credit in 2016 nor 2017. Protec made two business
purpose loans and zero consumer loans in 2016.”) and 21 (i.e., “Protec made two
loans in 2017. One of the loans was to a limited liability company for a
development project. The other loan was the $170,000 loan to Plaintiff.”). While K. Wang argues
that Protec was a creditor under section 1602(aa), K. Wang has not brought a
cause of action under Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (“HOEPA”), as
discussed below. Further, while K. Wang asserts that Protec is a “creditor”
pursuant to 12 C.F.R. section 226.2(a)(17)(v) (explaining, in part, that “[a]
person regularly extends consumer credit if, in any 12-month period, the person
originates more than one credit extension that is subject to the requirements
of § 226.32 or one or more such credit extensions through a mortgage broker”), K.
Wang does not offer up any evidence that the requirements of section 226.32
applied.Moving Defendants also argue that K. Wang’s TILA
cause of action is time-barred. The Court agrees.Section 1640(e) of
Title 15 of the United States Code provides, in relevant part, that “any action
under this section may be brought . . . within one year from the date of the
occurrence of the violation” and that “[a]ny action under this section with
respect to any violation of section 1639, 1639b, or 1639c of this title may be
brought . . . before the end of the 3-year period beginning on the date of the
occurrence of the violation.”Here, any failure to
make the required disclosures occurred at the time the loan documents were
signed, which occurred on July 24, 2017. (UMF No. 12.) Plaintiff’s lawsuit was
filed on June 27, 2019, nearly two years later.Although K. Wang, in
opposition, asserts that the three-year statute of limitations applies, based
on the purported applicability of 15 U.S.C. section 1639, the Court notes that the
Operative Complaint does not allege any violation of section 1639, which falls
under HOEPA.[FN6] (See, e.g., Cunningham v. Nationscredit Financial Servs. Corp. (7th Cir.
2007) 497 F.3d 715, 717; Lopez v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, Nat. Ass’n (E.D.
Cal. 2012) 2012 WL 2953065, at *5 [“Plaintiff’s complaint does not allege facts
demonstrating that her mortgage qualifies for protection under HOEPA. Even
assuming the truth of Plaintiff’s allegations, her failure to sufficiently
allege that her mortgage falls under HOEPA protection subjects the claim to
dismissal”].) “On a motion for summary judgment, the issues are framed by the
pleadings since it is those allegations to which the motion must respond.” (Scolinoa
v. Kolts (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 635, 641.) The Court declines to address Moving Defendants’ other arguments made as
to the TILA cause of action as they are unnecessary to resolve the instant
motion. Summary judgment is granted as to this cause of action. 
 
Sixth Cause of Action (i.e., for Rescission)K. Wang’s sixth cause of action is predicated on
Civil Code section 1689, subdivision (b)(1), which allows a party to a contract
to rescind the contract “[i]f the
consent of the party rescinding, . . . was given by mistake, or obtained
through . . . fraud, or undue influence, exercised by or with the connivance of
the party as to whom he rescinds.” Moving
Defendants assert that K. Wang’s sixth cause of action is barred because K.
Wang did not and could not tender at any time before the property was sold. The
Court agrees.“One who desires to
cancel a contract on the ground of fraud or mistake must tender back whatever
he has received prior to the commencement of the action, offer to place his
contractee in statu quo and he must
allege such tender or offer in his complaint.” (Williams v. Smith (1954)
127 Cal.App.2d 607, 612; Civ. Code § 1691(b) [“to effect a rescission a party
to the contract must. . . [r]estore to the other party everything of value
which he has received from him under the contract or offer to restore the same
upon condition that the other party do likewise. . .”].)K. Wang does not
explain the nature of his dispute as to material fact no. 62 (i.e., “Plaintiff
never requested a payoff amount from Protec or Cheung or BB Wells, never
communicated any notice of tender or intent to tender, and never offered to
return the principal money lent to Plaintiff or any portion thereof. From the
date of Protec’s loan to Plaintiff onward, Plaintiff never paid a single lender
on the Property.”). K. Wang concedes that, as of the time of the May 2019
foreclosure, he did not have $170,000 “to pay off the $170,000 loan/principal.”
(Response to Material Fact No. 57.) Accordingly, the Court grants Moving
Defendants’ motion for summary judgment as to the sixth cause of action. 
 
Seventh Cause of Action (i.e., for Wrongful
Foreclosure) “[W]here a mortgagee
or trustee makes an unauthorized sale under a power of sale he and his
principal are liable to the mortgagor for the value of the property at the
time of the sale in excess of the mortgages and liens against said
property.” (Munger v. Moore (1970) 11 Cal.App.3d 1, 11 [emphasis
added]).It is undisputed that
K. Wang testified that the value of the property was around $950,000 to
$1,050,000 at the time of foreclosure in 2019. (UMF No. 64.) Further, Cheung
attests that a property tax bill on the property from the Los Angeles County
Assessor’s Office appraised the property to have a value of $1,003,700 as of
May 10, 2019, which he appealed, and that an April 13, 2021 re-appraisal of the
property value conducted by the County of Los Angeles Appeals Board reduced the
property value to $813,000.00. (Cheung Decl., ¶ 61, Exh. 53.)It is also undisputed
that K. Wang gifted C. Wang 50% of the ownership of the property on March 13, 2019 (UMF No. 50),
that C. Wang filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding on March 14, 2019 (UMF No. 51),
and that C. Wang, as a co-owner of the property, listed in her bankruptcy schedules that
the property had a value of $1,100,000 and an outstanding balance of $869,000
from the two Wells Fargo Liens (UMF No. 52). K. Wang does not explain the
nature of his dispute as to material fact 66 (i.e., “Given the value range
maximum of $1,100,000, and the debt on the Property of $1,139,861, Plaintiff
could not have been damaged by the foreclosure because the debt exceeded every
valuation in the record”). While K. Wang argues that the property was
ultimately sold for $1.44 million, what matters is the valuation of the
property at the time of the foreclosure. Because the total liens on the property exceeded the
value of the property at the time of the sale, K. Wang cannot demonstrate he
incurred any damages. The Court thus grants Moving Defendants’ motion for summary
judgment as to this cause of action. 
 
Ninth Cause of Action (i.e., for Unfair Business
Practices) Business and Professions Code section 17200
“prohibits practices that are unfair, unlawful or fraudulent.” (Countrywide
Financial Corp. v. Bundy (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 234, 256.) “While the scope
of conduct covered by the UCL is broad, its remedies are limited. A UCL action
is equitable in nature; damages cannot be recovered.” (Korea Supply Co. v.
Lockheed Martin Corp. (2003) 29 Cal.4th 1134, 1144.) Under the UCL,
“prevailing plaintiffs are generally limited to injunctive relief and
restitution.” (Id. [quotations and citation omitted].)Moving Defendants assert that K. Wang’s ninth cause
of action fails because damages are not an available remedy under Business and
Professions Code section 17200 and because, while K. Wang does not claim a
remedy of restitution, he made no payments that could be restored. The Court
agrees. Again, the Operative Complaint is devoid of any requests for injunctive
relief and/or restitution. (See FAC, ¶¶ 72-77 and Prayer.)Accordingly, the Court grants Moving Defendants’
motion for summary judgment.
