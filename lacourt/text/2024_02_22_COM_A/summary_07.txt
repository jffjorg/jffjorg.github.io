And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case, which is a dispute between Plenitude Holdings, LLC (the plaintiff) and the County of Los Angeles (the defendant) over a breach of contract. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant breached a 2021 Ground Lease agreement and a 2022 Amendment, which required the defendant to consider the plaintiff's request for an additional extension to commence construction of the redevelopment plan in good faith. The defendant denies any breach of contract and argues that the plaintiff's request was unreasonable.

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the first cause of action for breach of contract, finding that the plaintiff's complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. However, the judge has overruled the demurrer to the second and third causes of action, finding that the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to state claims for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and breach of the contractual duty of reasonableness, good faith, and fair dealing.

The judge has given the plaintiff 10 days to amend the first cause of action and has set a hearing date for February 22, 2024.
