And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling grants a motion filed by Helen Won, counsel for Plaintiff Malcolm Harper, to be relieved as counsel. The motion was filed on January 16, 2023, after Harper abandoned the case and failed to respond to Won's calls. Won served the motion at Harper's last known address, but correspondence was returned as undeliverable. As Won was unable to determine a new address for Harper, she served the motion and supporting papers to the clerk of the court, as required by statute. The court finds that Won has complied with all necessary requirements, and therefore grants the motion. The order will be effective upon the filing of proof of service of the signed order upon Harper.
