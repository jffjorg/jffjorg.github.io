And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication, finding that there are numerous material issues of fact that remain in dispute. The plaintiff, Compton Unified School District, seeks to adjudicate claims against James Burnett and his company, BP Builders, for violating conflict-of-interest provisions. The District argues that Burnett's contracts were solicited, negotiated, and approved by AD Liddell, who had a financial interest in LDCP, a company that was a partner with Burnett. The District seeks an order requiring Burnett to disgorge any profits made from the void contracts and to make restitution in the amount of $608,470.31.

The Judge finds that the District has not met its burden of establishing that it is entitled to adjudication of the issues. The Judge notes that there are numerous disputes of fact, including whether AD Liddell had authority to approve invoices for payment, whether Burnett was aware of internal payment processes at the District, and whether AD Liddell directed contracts to Burnett. The Judge also finds that the District has not established that Burnett was aware of the internal payment process at the District, and that AD Liddell's involvement in the process is unclear.

The Judge also finds that the District's objections to the declaration of James Burnett are overruled, except for hearsay statements. The Judge notes that the District has not explained the relevance of certain facts, such as the involvement of Shelby Development Company, a company authorized to conduct business in California, and the payment of $500 from BP Builder's business account to LDCP's business account.

Overall, the Judge finds that the District has not met its burden of establishing that it is entitled to summary adjudication, and therefore denies the motion.
