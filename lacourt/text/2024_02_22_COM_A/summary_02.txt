And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling continues the hearing on a petition to change the name of Kamron Jeffery Santana, a 15-year-old minor, to Kamron Devon Marshall. The court previously continued the hearing to permit the guardian to serve notice on the father and for the petitioner to comply with publication requirements. However, the guardian was unable to provide proof of service on the father, and the court's file does not reflect that the petitioner complied with the publication requirements. As a result, the court is continuing the hearing to May 7, 2024, and ordering the petitioner to comply with the requirements and serve notice on the father 30 days before the hearing.
