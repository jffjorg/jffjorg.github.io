The demurrer was filed in response to the Complaint filed by Richard Diaz and others, alleging that Progressive mishandled their uninsured motorist claim. The court has reviewed the information presented and determined that the demurrer should be taken off the calendar due to the untimely service of the motion on January 26, 2024. According to California Code of Civil Procedure, the motion should have been filed and served by January 25, 2024, taking into account the court holidays on February 12 and 19, 2024. The court has also noted that the Plaintiffs have informed counsel that an amended complaint will be filed.
