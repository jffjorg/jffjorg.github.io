 JEFFERY SANTANA

[TENTATIVE]
ORDER CONTINUING THE HEARING ON PETITION TO CHANGE NAME 
 
      Petitioner, Kamron
 Jeffery Santana, is 15 years old and files this petition through a
legal guardian and grandmother, Concepcion Jones.  Petitioner proposes a name change to
Kamron Devon Marshall to add the father’s surname.  
      The Court
previously continued the hearing on this petition from January 10, 2024, to
permit the guardian to “provide notice of the hearing to any living parent of
the minor by personal service at least 30 days before the hearing.” The
Guardian was able to locate the father, but there is no proof that the Guardian
delivered this petition to the father. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1277.) 
      The
Court also continued the hearing to permit Petitioner to comply with the
requirements for publication of the Order to Show Cause. (Code Civ. Proc., §
1277.) The Court’s file does not reflect that Petitioner complied.
      Accordingly,
the court again continues the hearing to May 7, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department A of the
Compton Courthouse. Petitioner is ordered to comply with publication
requirements and serve notice of the hearing on the father 30 days before the
hearing.
