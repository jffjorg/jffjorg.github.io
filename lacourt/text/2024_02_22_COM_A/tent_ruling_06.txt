 Richard Diaz, et al v. Progressive Insurance
Thursday,
 February 22, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER TAKING THE HEARING ON
DEFENDANT’S DEMURRER TO PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT OFF CALENDAR
 
      This
action arises from the alleged mishandling of Plaintiffs’ uninsured motorist
claim by Defendant, Progressive Insurance (“Progressive”).
      Progressive
demurs to all causes of action on grounds Plaintiffs did not allege that all
conditions precedent to the accrual of their claims against their insurer have
been satisfied. Defense counsel has met and conferred with Plaintiffs’ counsel
who informed that an amended complaint would be filed. 
      Defendant
untimely served the motion on Plaintiffs on January 26, 2024. Plaintiffs are entitled
to 16 court days of notice increased by two court days for service by
electronic mail. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1010.6, subd. (a)(4)(A).) Accordingly, the motion should have
been filed and served by January 25, 2024, as February 12 and 19, 2024, were court
holidays and are not counted as “court days.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 12a.)
