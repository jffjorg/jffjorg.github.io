[TENTATIVE]
DENYING THE PETITION FOR CHANGE OF NAME
 
       The court has
considered the Petition filed on October
 19, 2023, by Dominique Jasmine Jolly to change name to Jasmine
 Dominique Jolly because Petitioner
 is under a protection order, believes she is in danger, and is the victim of
 “severe identity theft”. 
Petitioner is over the age of 18. The Criminal History Assessment does
not reflect any substantial reason for denying the petition. 
       This is the
third petition for a name change filed by Petitioner. In Case No. 22CMCP00128
 filed on July 29, 2022, Petitioner filed two petitions but both were
dismissed for failure to submit proof of publication of the order to show
cause. 
       This Court
continued the hearing on this petition from January 4, 2024 because the Court’s
file did not reflect that Petitioner complied with the requirements for
publication of the Order to Show Cause or otherwise explain why she is exempt
from the requirements for publication. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1277 subd. (a)(2)(A).
       As Petitioner
did not comply with the foregoing requirements, the Petition is DENIED.
