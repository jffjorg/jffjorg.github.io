[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING
 MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL FOR PLAINTIFF, MALCOLM HARPER
 
Helen Won, counsel for Plaintiff,
 Malcolm Harper, filed this motion on January
 16, 2023, for an order to be relieved as counsel because the
 client has abandoned the case and fails to respond to counsel’s calls.
Counsel served the motion at the client’s last known address; however,
correspondence has been returned as undeliverable. Counsel is unable to
determine a new address, therefore, counsel served the motion and supporting
papers to the clerk of the court, for that party as required by statute. (Code Civ. Proc., §
1011
subd. (b)(d).)
Counsel has complied with the requirements of
California Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1362.
Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED. The order is effective upon the filing of
the proof of service of the signed order upon the client.
