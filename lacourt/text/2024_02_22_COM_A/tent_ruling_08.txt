provision on which the concessionaire relied did not impose an obligation to
“even participate” in activity leading to modification. "Notwithstanding
any of the provisions of this contract, the parties may hereafter, by mutual
consent, agree to modifications thereof or additions thereto in writing which
are not forbidden by law. The State shall have the right to grant reasonable extensions
of time to Concessionaire for any purpose or for the performance of any
obligation of Concessionaire hereunder.” (Racine
& Laramie, Ltd. v. Department of Parks & Recreation (1992) 11
Cal.App.4th 1026, 1030–1031].)
