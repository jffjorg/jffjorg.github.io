And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment in a quiet title action against the defendant, 1670 Gilcrest Dr., et al. The plaintiff, Gilcrest LLC, filed a complaint seeking to quiet title to a portion of Assessor's Parcel No. 4352-004-017, known as the "Gap Property." The plaintiff alleges that it acquired fee title to the surrounding property and that record title to the Gap Property was held by the defendant, Gilcrest Suspended Corp. The plaintiff also alleges that it has used the Gap Property in a manner that is actual, open, exclusive, hostile, and adverse to any claims of the defendant.

The judge ruled that an evidentiary hearing is required before entering default judgment on a quiet title cause of action, as provided by Code of Civil Procedure section 764.010. The plaintiff has not requested an evidentiary hearing nor has it submitted any evidence with the request for default judgment. Therefore, the request for default judgment is denied.
