REQUEST FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT (filed 5/22/2024) 
 
TENTATIVE RULING 
 
Request for default judgment is DENIED.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On July 18,
2023, Plaintiff Gilcrest LLC filed the Complaint for Quiet Title against Defendant
1670
Gilcrest Dr., a suspended California corporation; and all persons claiming by,
through, or under it; and all other persons unknown, claiming any legal or
equitable right, title, estate, lien, or interest in the property described in
this complaint, which is adverse to Plaintiff's title or creates any cloud on
Plaintiff's title. 
 
The Complaint
alleges the following. Plaintiff is the sole owner of fee simple title to that certain
real property constituting a portion of Assessor's Parcel No. 4352-004-017, hereafter
referred to as the “Gap Property.” On or about March 28, 2023, Plaintiff
acquired fee title to the real property surrounding the Gap Property. During
the course of the Purchase Transaction, it was discovered that (1) record title
to the Gap Property was held not by the seller in the Purchase Transaction but
by Defendant Gilcrest Suspended Corp. as a result of that certain Grant Deed
executed on August 11, 1953 by Duncan R. Rimmer and Pearl J. Rimmer as grantors
in favor of Gilcrest Suspended Corp. as grantee and recorded on September 15,
1953 as Document No. 1423, and (2) although predecessor owners of the
Surrounding Property had used the Gap Property in the manner hereafter alleged
and paid all property taxes associated with the Gap Property for several
decades, record title remained in the name of Defendant Suspended Corp. For
more than five years preceding the filing of this action (and in fact for many
decades prior to such five year period), Plaintiff and Plaintiffs predecessors
in interest have used the Gap Property in a manner that is actual, open,
exclusive, hostile, and adverse to any claims of Gilcrest Suspended Corp. and
have in addition timely paid all real property taxes assessed against the Gap
Property. Plaintiff seeks to quiet title as of March 28, 2023, the date as of
which Plaintiff acquired fee title to the Surrounding Property.
 
On May 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Request for
Default Judgment. 
 
II.DISCUSSION
 
A.      Legal
Standard
 
CCP § 585 permits entry of a judgment after a Defendant has
failed to timely answer after being properly served.  A party seeking
judgment on the default by the Court must file a Request for Court Judgment,
and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible
evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as
necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of
judgment; (6) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought;
(7) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an
application for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for
attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. 
(CRC Rule 3.1800.) 
 
B.     
Discussion 
 
Plaintiff submitted a CIV-100 form and seeks
entry of default judgment against Defendants.
 
However, the Court cannot grant default judgment
on Plaintiff’s quiet title action. An
evidentiary hearing is required before entering default judgment on a quiet
title cause of action. (CCP § 764.010; Yeung v. Soos (2004) 119
Cal.App.4th 576, 582.) Code of Civil Procedure
section 764.010 provides that:
 
“The court shall examine into and
determine the plaintiff's title against the claims of all the defendants. The
court shall not enter judgment by default but shall in all cases require
evidence of plaintiff's title and hear such evidence as may be offered
respecting the claims of any of the defendants, other than claims the validity
of which is admitted by the plaintiff in the complaint. The court shall render
judgment in accordance with the evidence and the law.” 
 
“[S]ection 764.010 is frequently referred to as a prohibition
against default judgments in quiet title actions. However, the provision
against default judgments [in quiet title actions] appears to be a misnomer;
i.e., it seems only to require a higher standard of evidence at the ‘prove-up’
hearing []. Competent evidence is required at the hearing of a quiet title
action after default…[S]ection 764.010 simply provides that a plaintiff does
not have a right to entry of judgment in his or her favor as a matter of course
following entry of the defendant's default in a quiet title action. The statute
does not preclude entry of a defendant's default. In fact, the statute was
expressly intended to be consistent with...section 583, subdivision (c), which
concerns default judgments where service is by publication.” (Yeung v. Soos
(2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 576, 580-581.)  To prevail on a quiet
title claim, a plaintiff must establish title to the property in dispute. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 761.020; Hoeller v. Lloyd (1959) 173 Cal.App.2d 777,
778.) 
 
Here, it does not appear that Plaintiff has requested an
evidentiary hearing nor has Plaintiff submitted any evidence with the request
for default judgment. Accordingly, request for
default judgment is DENIED.
 
III.
CONCLUSION 
 
Request for default judgment is DENIED.
