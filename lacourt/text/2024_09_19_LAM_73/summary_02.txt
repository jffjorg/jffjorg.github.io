And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion for attorney fees and costs filed by Defendant Courtney Young. The Court has granted the motion, awarding Defendant $25,158.35 in attorney fees and costs incurred in connection with her successful anti-SLAPP motion and the instant motion.

The Court's analysis is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 425.16(c), 1032, and 1033.5, which provide for the award of attorney fees and costs to the prevailing party in a civil action. The Court also considered the hourly rates and reasonable hours incurred by Defendant's counsel, as well as the complexity of the issues and the nature of the litigation.

The Court found that the fees sought by Defendant are reasonable and do not include excessive time billed or duplicative entries. The Court notes that Plaintiff filed a notice of non-opposition to the motion and does not dispute that Defendant is entitled to fees. However, the Court will not grant the request for $2,975 in attorneys' fees that Defendant anticipated she would incur in connection with opposing this motion.

The Court's ruling is effective as of September 19, 2024.
