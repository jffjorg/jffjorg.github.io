DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO COMPEL DISCOVERY
RESPONSES FROM PLAINTIFF TO SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES (SET ONE) AND REQUEST FOR
PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS (SET ONE) (filed 07/12/2024)
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendant’s Motion to
Compel Discovery Responses from Plaintiff to Special Interrogatories (Set One)
and Request for Production of Documents (Set One) is DENIED without prejudice. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
On August 23, 2023, Plaintiff Katherine Averilla filed the instant
action against Defendant ASN Long Beach Nephro Care. 
 
Plaintiff asserts the following causes of action:
1.     
Retaliation in Violation of Labor Code §1102.5; 
2.     
Wrongful Termination In Violation Of Public Policy; 
3.     
Violation Of Labor Code Section 1198.5; 
4.     
Unpaid Wages (Labor Code § 202); 
5.     
Failure To Pay Overtime (Labor Code §§ 510, 1194); 
6.     
Failure To Provide Rest Periods (Labor Code §226.7); 
7.     
Failure To Provide Off-Duty Meal Period (Labor Code §§ 226.7,
512);
8.     
Failure To Furnish Accurate Wage Statements (Labor Code §§ 226,
226.3, 1174, 1174.5); and 
9.     
Waiting Time Penalties (Labor Code §§ 226, 226.3)
 
The Complaint alleges the following. In 2022, Plaintiff was hired by
Defendant as an acute dialysis coordinator. Plaintiff began asking for proper
payment of wages, mandatory breaks and time off. However, Plaintiff alleges
that instead of properly paying Plaintiff’s wages, giving her mandatory breaks,
and remedying violations of company policy as reported by Plaintiff, Defendant
fired Plaintiff. Plaintiff further alleges Defendants discriminated and
retaliated against Plaintiff solely because of her race, age, and attempt to
obtain her proper pay.
 
On July 12, 2024, Defendant filed the
instant Motion to Compel Discovery Responses from Plaintiff to Special
Interrogatories (Set One) and Request for Production of Documents (Set One), arguing:
·       Defendant moves to compel responses to:
o  
Defendant’s Requests for Special Interrogatories, Set No. One,
(Requests 1-61)
o  
Defendant's Request for Production of Documents, Set No One
(Request 1-31)
·       Defendant requests the
following sanctions:
o  
Sanctions in the amount of $2,500 for the unprofessional and
untimely cancellation of Dr. Gia Tran’s deposition, which caused significant
financial harm and disruption
o  
Sanctions in the amount of $3,000 for Plaintiff’s failure to
provide adequate written discovery responses, accounting for the time spent on
the meet and confer process and this motion to compel
 
No opposition was filed. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
A.      Legal
Standard 
 
“Any party
may obtain discovery . . . by propounding to any other party to the action
written interrogatories to be answered under oath.”¿ CCP § 2030.010(a).¿
“Within 30 days after service of interrogatories, the party to whom the
interrogatories are propounded shall serve the original of the response to them
on the propounding party, unless on motion of the propounding party the court
has shortened the time for response, or unless on motion of the responding
party the court has extended the time for response.”¿ CCP § 2030.260(a).¿ 
¿ 
“The party to
whom interrogatories have been propounded shall respond in writing under oath
separately to each interrogatory by any of the following: (1) An answer
containing the information sought to be discovered. (2) An exercise of the
party's option to produce writings. (3) An objection to the particular
interrogatory.”¿ CCP § 2030.210(a).¿ “If the responding party does not have
personal knowledge sufficient to respond fully to an interrogatory, that party
shall so state, but shall make a reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the
information by inquiry to other natural persons or organizations, except where
the information is equally available to the propounding party.”¿ CCP §
2030.220(c).¿ 
¿ 
“On receipt
of a response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that any of the
following apply: (1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or
incomplete. (2) An exercise of the option to produce documents under Section
2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is
inadequate. (3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too
general.”¿ CCP § 2030.300(a).¿ “A motion under subdivision (a) [of CCP §
2030.300] shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040.”¿ CCP § 2030.300(b).¿ In addition, a separate statement is required.¿
California Rules of Court (“CRC”) Rule 3.1345(a)(2).¿ 
¿ 
“Unless
notice of this motion is given within 45 days of the service of the verified
response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific
later date to which the propounding party and the responding party have agreed
in writing, the propounding party waives any right to compel a further response
to the interrogatories.”¿ CCP § 2030.300(c).¿“[T]he time limitations set forth
in section 2030 and section 2034, subdivision (a) [are] mandatory and [when]
not met, the trial court's order is in excess of its jurisdiction.”¿(Vidal
Sassoon, Inc. v. Superior Court¿(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 681, 685.)
 
A motion to
compel further responses to a demand for inspection or production of documents
(“RFP”) may be brought based on: (1) incomplete statements of compliance; (2)
inadequate, evasive or incomplete claims of inability to comply; or (3)
unmerited or overly generalized objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310(c).) 
 
A motion to
compel further production must set forth specific facts showing good cause
justifying the discovery sought by the inspection demand. (See Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.310(b)(1).) It is not necessary for the motion to show that the material
sought will be admissible in evidence. “Good cause” may be found to justify
discovery where specific facts show that the discovery is necessary for
effective trial preparation or to prevent surprise at trial. (See Associated
Brewers Dist. Co. v. Superior Court (1967) 65 Cal.2d 583, 586-588; see also
CCP §§ 2017.010, 2019.030(a)(1) (Information is discoverable if it is itself
admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence and it is not unreasonably cumulative or
duplicative, or is obtainable from some other source that is more convenient,
less burdensome, or less expensive.); Lipton v. Superior Court (1996) 48
Cal.App.4th 1599, 1611-1612 (noting a party may obtain discovery regarding any
matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the
pending action, if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or
appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence).) 
 
B.      Procedural
Deficiencies 
 
According to Defendant’s motion, Defendant
is seeking responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, (Requests 1-61) and
Request for Production of Documents, Set One, (Requests 1-31). (Notice of
Motion, p. 2.) Defendant is also seeking sanctions for the cancellation of a
deposition and sanctions for bringing the instant motion. (Notice of Motion, p.
2.) However, the Court notes that there are several procedural deficiencies
with Defendant’s motion. 
 
Defendant propounded Special
Interrogatories, Set One, (Requests 1-61) and Request for Production of
Documents, Set One, (Requests 1-31) on Plaintiff on February 28, 2024. (Motion,
p. 3, Exs. A & D.) Plaintiff responded to these discovery requests on April
15, 2024, with additional responses on April 23, 2024. (Motion, p. 3, Exs. C
& F.) Defendant argues in its motion that Plaintiff responded to
Defendant’s discovery requests with improper objections. 
 
First, the Court notes that although
Defendant’s motion is styled as a motion to compel, this is in fact a motion to
compel further responses because Plaintiff already served responses. Motions to
compel further responses must be accompanied by a separate statement. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(a)(3).) A properly-prepared Separate Statement
enables both the parties and the Court to accurately analyze relevance and
objections. The substantial rights of the parties are affected when there is no
separate statement. Here, Defendant failed to file separate statements. 
 
Further, the Court notes that the single
motion submitted should have been submitted as separate motions, one for the
RFPs, one for the special interrogatories, and one seeking sanctions as to the
cancelled deposition.  While there is no specific provision of law that,
in so many words, requires separate motions for each, Code of Civil Procedure
1003 provides: “ Every direction of a court or judge, made or entered in
writing, and not included in a judgment, is denominated an order. An
application for an order is a motion.” Additionally, as discussed above, motions
under Code of Civil Procedure §2030.300 & §2031.310 each require separate
statements. The effect is to require that each request for further response to
RFPs or special interrogatories, requires a separate motion as a matter of
course, as the Plaintiff is requesting relief as to a specific and distinct
discovery request. Thus, the current motion appears to be combining multiple
motions into one. Due process and basic fairness requires that each party
against whom relief is sought is adequately appraised of the relief sought
against them in separate motions in order to prevent inequitable and unjust
results. 
 
The Court also notes that no proofs of
service are attached to Defendant’s motion. Failure to give notice of a motion
is not only a violation of the statutory requirements but of due process. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1005; Jones v. Otero (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 754,
757.)  
 
Based on the foregoing procedural deficiencies, the Court DENIES
Defendant’s Motion to Compel Discovery
Responses from Plaintiff to Special Interrogatories (Set One) and Request for
Production of Documents (Set One).
 
DISPOSITION
 

Defendant’s Motion to Compel Discovery Responses from
Plaintiff to Special Interrogatories (Set One) and Request for Production of
Documents (Set One) is DENIED without prejudice.
