And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the request for default judgment filed by the plaintiffs against defendant Kathy Hyun Kyung Lee. The plaintiffs allege that defendant Lee misrepresented herself as a licensed mortgage/loan broker or agent and convinced them to deposit $43,759.04, which defendant Lee did not refund. The plaintiffs are seeking judgment against defendant Lee in the amount of $154,770.52, including the original deposit, interest, and costs.

The Judge has denied the request for default judgment without prejudice, finding that the plaintiffs have not adequately supported their claims for damages. The Judge noted that the plaintiffs' declarations do not provide any documentary evidence of the deposit, such as bank statements or correspondence with defendant Lee. The Judge further stated that a CCP § 585 declaration must include a proper foundation for the testimony, which the plaintiffs' declarations do not do.

The Judge has given the parties the opportunity to respond to the tentative ruling and has set a hearing for September 19, 2024.
