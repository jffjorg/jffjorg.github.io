DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO VACATE ENTRY OF
DEFAULT (filed 06/10/2024)
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendant’s Motion to Vacate Entry of
Default is GRANTED. 
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On August 28, 2023, Plaintiff Brian Whitaker filed this
action against Defendant Helen Shamma Chaaban for violations of the Americans
with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) and violations of the Unruh Civil Rights Act
(“Unruh”). 
 
The Complaint alleges that Whitaker suffers from a spinal
cord injury and is a quadriplegic who uses a wheelchair for mobility. (Complaint,
¶ 1.) The action stems from Whitaker’s visit to Chaaban’s restaurant on July
19, 2023 where Whitaker found that the facility failed to comply with ADA
standards. (Complaint, ¶¶ 8-11.) Specifically, Whitaker alleges that there was
not enough toe clearance under the outdoor dining surfaces. (Complaint, ¶ 11.)
 
On October 4, 2023, Chaaban filed a Cross-Complaint against Whitaker
alleging causes of action for: (1) Unfair Business Practices, (2) Fraud and
Deceit, (3) Tortious Abuse of Process, and (4) Champerty and Unclean Hands.
 
On January 26, 2024, the Court granted Cross-Defendant Whitaker’s special
motion to strike the Cross-Complaint.
 
The Court entered default on May 20, 2024.
 
On June 10, 2024, Defendant filed the instant
Motion to Vacate Entry of Default, arguing:
·      
Defendant
is entitled to relief under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 473 due
to mistake, inadvertence and excusable neglect.
·      
Pro
per Defendant filed a declaration stating she inadvertently failed to timely
file an answer to Plaintiff’s Complaint.
·       Defendant attached her proposed
Answer.
 
No
opposition was filed.
 
II. DISCUSSION 
 
A.      Legal
Standard 
 
The Court’s
authority to set aside defaults and default judgments is found in section 473,
subdivision (b). This single subdivision contains two separate provisions for
setting aside default: a discretionary provision and a mandatory provision. The
mandatory provisions do not apply in this instance because Defendant is
self-represented and there is no attorney. (See Esther B. v. City of Los
Angeles (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1093, 1100 [concluding that “the plain
language of section 473, subdivision (b) precludes mandatory relief in favor of
a ‘pro. per.’ party” even when party was herself an attorney].) 
 
The
discretionary relief provisions of section 473, subdivision (b) provide in
pertinent part: 
 
“The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or
his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other
proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall be
accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall be made
within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment,
dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.” 
 
As to
discretionary relief, “[a]lthough a trial court has discretion to vacate the
entry of a default or subsequent judgment, this discretion may be exercised
only after the party seeking relief has shown that there is a proper ground for
relief, and that the party has raised that ground in a procedurally proper
manner, within any applicable time limits.” (Cruz v. Fagor America, Inc.
(2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 488, 495.) 
 
B.      Discussion
 
Defendant
argues the default should be set aside pursuant to CCP section 473(b) on
grounds of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.
 
CCP section
473(b) provides that relief must be sought within a reasonable time, not
exceeding six months after entry of default or default judgment. Here, default
was entered on May 20, 2024. Defendant filed
the instant motion on June 10, 2024. As this is within the six month
limitation, the Court finds the motion is timely.
 
The Court
finds Defendant is entitled to relief pursuant to CCP section 473(b). It is
well established that trial courts should be liberal in granting relief under
section 473. (See Kisling v. Otani (1962) 201 Cal.App.2d 62, 66; Brown
v. Martin (1914) 23 Cal.App. 736, 739.) This is because the law favors
resolution of cases on the merits. (See Jones v. Lindsey (1952) 114
Cal.App.2d 237, 239; Brown, supra, 23 Cal.App. at 739.) “Even in a case
where the showing under section 473 is not strong, or where there is any doubt
as to the setting aside of a default, such doubt should be resolved in favor of
the application [of section 473 relief.]” (Arnke v. Lazzari Fuel Co.
(1962) 202 Cal.App.2d 278, 281.) Here, Defendant declares she made the
inadvertent mistake in failing to timely file her Answer to the Complaint.
Defendant states “I realized that I made inadvertent mistake when I learned
recently the entry of default and the formal minute order regarding the
demurrer hearing. At the demurrer hearing, though I understood my demurrer was
not successful, I could not hear specifically about any future legal document
that I should file.” (Chaaban Decl., ¶ 5.) 
 
The Court notes that Plaintiff did not file an opposition. “A party who has not timely filed
written opposition to a motion…may not be afforded an opportunity to offer oral
argument at the hearing.” (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.) “The failure to file opposition creates an inference
that the motion or demurrer is meritorious.”¿ (Id.)¿ “In such cases, the
court may hear argument limited to a request for a continuance of the hearing
in order to afford an opportunity for written opposition.” (Id.) “[T]he
rule is patently intended to prevent the introduction of legal theories without
prior notice to opposing counsel and the court.” (Id.)
 
Given that any
doubts should be resolved in favor of setting aside the default and the policy
of resolving cases on the merits, the Court finds Defendant is entitled to
relief under CCP section 473(b)’s discretionary relief provision. Defendant
has filed a proposed Answer to the Complaint in compliance with CCP section
473(b).
 
The motion is GRANTED and Defendant’s default is ordered set
aside. Defendant is ordered to file its proposed Answer—which is attached in
support of the motion—within ten (10) days of the date of this order so that it
becomes an operative pleading in this action. 

 
III. DISPOSITION
 

Defendant’s
Motion to Vacate Entry of Default is GRANTED.
 
Defendant is
ordered to file its proposed Answer—which is attached in support of the
motion—within ten (10) days of the date of this order so that it becomes an
operative pleading in this action.
