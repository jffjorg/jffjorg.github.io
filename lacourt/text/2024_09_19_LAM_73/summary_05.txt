And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the Defendant's Motion to Vacate Entry of Default. The Defendant, Helen Shamma Chaaban, filed the motion claiming that she made an inadvertent mistake in failing to timely file her answer to the Complaint. The Court finds that the motion is timely and that the Defendant is entitled to relief under California Code of Civil Procedure section 473 due to mistake, inadvertence, and excusable neglect. The Court notes that the Plaintiff did not file an opposition to the motion, which creates an inference that the motion is meritorious. The Court grants the motion and orders the Defendant to file its proposed answer within ten days of the date of the order.
