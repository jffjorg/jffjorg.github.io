 Case Number:  23STCV07418    Hearing Date:   June 25, 2024    Dept:  57 The Court is granting the motion of Homebound Technologies, Inc. to consolidate for all purposes two already-related actions: Watson v. Hackett (case number 23STCV07418) and Homebound Technologies, Inc. v. Watson (case number 23STCV12308).  There is a substantial overlap in the factual and legal issues presented in both actions that supports consolidation.  The Court discerns no practical reason at this time to parse out from consolidation the claims against Geoffrey Hackett in Watson v. Hackett.  Whether those claims should be bifurcated for trial is reserved for a later date based on a motion to bifurcate.
