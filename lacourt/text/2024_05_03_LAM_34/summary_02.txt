Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling is to deny the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions without prejudice. The defendant had requested terminating sanctions against the plaintiffs due to their failure to comply with discovery obligations. However, the court finds that the plaintiffs lost their legal representation during the period when they were required to respond to the discovery requests, and they were unable to defend themselves in this matter until they obtained counsel. The court is unaware of any reason why the plaintiffs should not immediately comply with the court's minute order dated February 28, 2024. Therefore, the motion is denied without prejudice.
