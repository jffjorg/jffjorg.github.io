ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 gives
the court the discretion to impose sanctions against anyone engaging in a
misuse of the discovery process. A court may impose terminating sanctions by
striking pleadings of the party engaged in misuse of discovery or entering
default judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d).) A violation of a
discovery order is sufficient for the imposition of terminating sanctions. (Collison
& Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1620.) Terminating
sanctions are appropriate when a party persists in disobeying the court's
orders. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 795–796.)
 
A terminating sanction is a "drastic
measure which should be employed with caution." (Deyo, supra,
at p. 793.) 
 
"A decision to order terminating
sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful,
preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe
sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial
court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction." (Mileikowsky v.
Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279–280.)
 
While the court has discretion to impose terminating
sanctions, these sanctions "should be appropriate to the dereliction and
should not exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the party
entitled to but denied discovery." (Deyo, supra, 84
Cal.App.3d at p. 793.) "[A] court is empowered to apply the ultimate
sanction against a litigant who persists in the outright refusal to comply with
his discovery obligations." (Id.) Discovery sanctions are not to be
imposed for punishment, but instead are used to encourage fair disclosure of
discovery to prevent unfairness resulting for the lack of information. (See Midwife
v. Bernal (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 57, 64 [superseded on other grounds as
stated in Kohan v. Cohan (1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 967, 971.)
 
"A trial court has broad discretion to
impose discovery sanctions, but two facts are generally prerequisite to the
imposition of nonmonetary sanctions . . . (1) absent unusual circumstances,
there must be a failure to comply with a court order, and (2) the failure must
be willful." (Biles v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th
1315, 1327; but see Reedy v. Bussell (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 1272, 1291
["willfulness is no longer a requirement for the imposition of discovery
sanctions."].)
 
II.       Discussion
 
Defendant/Cross-Complainant moves the Court to issue
terminating sanctions against Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants. (Motion for
Terminating Sanctions, p. 7.) 
 
Defendant/Cross-Complainant argues that terminating sanctions
are warranted because Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants have refused to comply with
the discovery obligations and not complied with the Court’s Minute Order dated
February 28, 2024. (Motion for Terminating Sanctions, pp. 7–9.) 
 
In the alternative, Defendant/Cross-Complainant argues that
it would be appropriate to issue evidentiary sanctions that would exclude any
evidence offered by Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants in support of their negligent
misrepresentation, fraud, and conversion claims. (Motion for Terminating
sanctions, p. 9:16–20.)
 
Defendant/Cross-Complainant requests $4,350.00 in monetary
sanctions for this motion, which would comprise of six hours of attorney work
at $725.00 per hour. (Motion for Terminating Sanctions, p. 9:21–26; Decl. Lin,
¶ 13.)
 
Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants do not oppose the Motion for
Terminating Sanctions, even though it appears they are now represented by legal
counsel. (See Notice of Change of Address, filed April 12, 2024; see also Ex
Parte Application to Continue Trial Date, All Trial Related Deadlines, and
MSJ Hearing Date, filed May 1, 2024.)
 
Based on the evidence currently before the Court, it does not
appear that Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants have complied with the Court’s Minute
Order dated February 28, 2024. However, Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants lost their
legal representation during the period when they were required to respond to
the discovery requests, and they were unable to defend themselves in this
matter until they obtained counsel. 
 
At this time, it does not appear to the Court that sanctions
are appropriate. However, Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants now appear to have legal
representation, and the Court is unaware of any reason why they should not
immediately comply with the Court’s Minute Order dated February 28, 2024. 
 
III.    
Conclusion
 
The Motion for Terminating Sanctions is DENIED without prejudice.
