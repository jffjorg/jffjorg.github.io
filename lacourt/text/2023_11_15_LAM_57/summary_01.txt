And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling granting Zvi Sperling's motion for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint (SAC) against his brother Jacob Sperling. The proposed SAC seeks to add five new causes of action, including intentional interference with contractual relations, breach of fiduciary duty, promissory estoppel, and judicial dissolution against new parties, including Naomi Sperling Goldman and Maxim Lighting International, Inc. The Court finds that Jacob will not be prejudiced by the granting of the motion, as the case is still in its early stages and there is ample time for discovery and motion deadlines. The Court also declines to weigh in on the merits of the new causes of action at this stage, instead allowing the parties to dispute them through an actual demurrer and opposition. Zvi is directed to file the proposed SAC by November 27, 2023.
