And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, Flintridge Riding Club, moves for summary judgment or summary adjudication of each cause of action brought by the plaintiff, David Johnston. The defendant establishes that it is entitled to summary judgment of the action. The plaintiff alleges nine causes of action, including labor code violations, business and professions code violations, and a claim under the private attorneys general act. All nine causes of action require that the plaintiff establish that the defendant employed him as an employee. The defendant presents sufficient evidence to negate that element of the plaintiff's action.

The defendant establishes that it is a referral agency under Labor Code section 2777 and that the plaintiff was an independent contractor under the Borello test. The defendant shows that the plaintiff was free from the control and direction of the referral agency, that the plaintiff delivered services to clients under his own name, and that he provided his own tools and supplies. The defendant also shows that the plaintiff was previously engaged in an independently established business or trade and that he was free to accept or reject clients and contracts.

The defendant also establishes that the plaintiff was an independent contractor under the ABC test. The court finds that the defendant has met its burden of showing that the plaintiff was an independent contractor under both the Borello test and the ABC test. The court grants the defendant's motion for summary judgment.
