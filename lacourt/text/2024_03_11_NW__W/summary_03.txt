And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted, in part, Plaintiff Bryan Guino's Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories from Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc. The motion seeks to compel Defendant to provide further responses to special interrogatories nos. 14 and 54-55, which seek information relevant to Plaintiff's claims. The court finds that Defendant's objections to the special interrogatories are without merit and that Defendant has not provided code-compliant responses. The court orders Defendant to provide further responses to the special interrogatories, including identifying software specifications for the Honda Sensing system and explaining why the repair orders demonstrate that Plaintiff's vehicle does not qualify for repurchase.

The court also denied Plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $1,830.00, finding that both parties had substantial justification for their positions.
