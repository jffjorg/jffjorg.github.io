And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on three motions: a motion for a protective order, a motion to strike, and a special motion to strike. The motion for a protective order is moot, as the subpoena was never served on the bank. The motion to strike is denied, as the allegations do not arise from protected speech. The special motion to strike is also denied, as the allegations do not arise from protected speech. The court finds that the allegations of intentional infliction of emotional distress, elder abuse, and civil harassment are not protected speech and therefore are not subject to an anti-SLAPP motion. The court also finds that the allegations of unauthorized practice of law are not protected speech and therefore are not subject to an anti-SLAPP motion.
