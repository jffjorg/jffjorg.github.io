The judge is considering a motion to correct an error in the name of the plaintiff in a default judgment.

However, the judgment has a clerical error, repeating the word "Commercial" in the plaintiff's name. The judge is granting the motion to correct this error, as allowed by Code of Civil Procedure section 473(d), which provides for the correction of clerical mistakes in judgments. The corrected judgment will be issued on a Judicial Council form JUD-100.
