 Case Number:  23STCV11736    Hearing Date:   January 11, 2024    Dept:  52 Plaintiff
National Commercial Recovery, Inc.’s Motion to Correct Name of Plaintiff in
Default Judgment
Plaintiff National Commercial Recovery, Inc. d/b/a
Blair Smith and Associates moves to amend the judgment to correct an error in
the plaintiff’s name.  
Code of Civil Procedure section 473(d) provides, “The
court may, upon motion of the injured party, or its own motion, correct
clerical mistakes in its judgment or orders as entered, so as to conform to the
judgment or order directed.”  A trial
court has “inherent power to correct clerical error in [a] judgment.”  (Ames v. Paley (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th
668, 672.)
The court entered default judgment for plaintiff
against defendant Stephanie Garcia on September 26, 2023.  The default judgment, however, has a clerical
error in plaintiff’s name.  It identifies
plaintiff as “National Commercial Commercial Recovery, Inc. a California
corporation d/b/a Blair Smith and Associates,” repeating the word
“Commercial.”  (Judgment, § 5.a.)  The court will correct this clerical error to
conform section 5.a. of the Judicial Council form JUD-100 to the default judgment
entered for plaintiff National Commercial Recovery, Inc. d/b/a Blair Smith and
Associates.
Disposition
Plaintiff National Commercial Recovery, Inc. d/b/a Blair Smith and Associates’
motion to correct name of plaintiff in default judgment is granted.  The court
will issue a corrected judgment on Judicial Council form JUD-100.
