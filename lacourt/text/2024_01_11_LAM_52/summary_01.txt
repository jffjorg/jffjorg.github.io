And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English:

The Judge has ruled that the defendants' demurrer is overruled, and they must answer the plaintiff's complaint within 15 days. The Judge found that the plaintiff's causes of action for elder abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, fraud, and penal code section 496 are sufficient and not "vague and unintelligible". The Judge also found that the defendants' arguments that the plaintiff's causes of action are vague and unintelligible are without merit, and that the complaint must be liberally construed in favor of the plaintiff. The Judge ruled that the defendants' demurrer was disfavored and was granted only because the pleading was not incomprehensible. The Judge also found that the defendants' arguments that the property could not be "stolen" because they paid for it and the plaintiff conveyed it are without merit, and that the statute extends to property that has been obtained in any manner constituting theft.
