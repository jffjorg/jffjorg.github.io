I. Background
A. Pleadings
1.
Complaint
Plaintiff Lenny K. Dykstra (Plaintiff) sues
Defendants Robert R. Shiri, The Law Offices of Robert R. Shiri, APC (Shiri Law)
(with Robert Shiri, the Shiri Defendants), and Does 1-100 pursuant to an August
20, 2021, Complaint alleging a single cause of action for declaratory relief
regarding legal fees and other issues that arose between the parties in
relation to LASC No. BC650381, a legal malpractice action by Plaintiff
Dykstra against Boucher, LLP in which Robert Shiri and Shiri Law
acted as counsel for Plaintiff Dykstra (the underlying action).
The summons and
Complaint were personally served on Shiri Law on August 25, 2021, and were
served by substituted service on Robert Shiri on August 30, 2021.
This action was
designated LASC No. 21STCV30922.
2.
Cross-Complaint
Shiri Law, in turn,
sues Plaintiff Dykstra pursuant to an August 26, 2021, Complaint filed in a separate
action as LASC No. 21SMCV01425. The Cross-Complaint alleges claims of breach of
contract, account stated, open book account, and reasonable value claims based
on legal fees owed from the underlying action.
B. Relevant
Procedural History
On August 26, 2021,
Shiri Law filed a notice of related case.
On September 10, 2021,
the Court related LASC No. 21STCV30922 (the Lead Case) and LASC
No. 21SMCV01425 (the Santa Monica Case).
On September 9, 2021, Shiri
Law served Plaintiff Dykstra with Form Interrogatories – General, Set No. 1
(FROGs, Set One), and Request for Admission, Set No. One (RFA, Set One).
On October 15, 2021,
Plaintiff secured an entry of default in the Lead Case as against
Robert Shiri.
On October 20, 2021,
Plaintiff secured an entry of default in the Lead Case
as against Shiri Law.
On October 21, 2021,
the Shiri Defendants filed a demurrer to the Complaint in the Lead Case.
On November 16, 2021, Shiri
Law filed two motions in the Santa Monica Case: (1) a motion to compel initial
responses to FROGs, Set One; and (2) a motion to deem the truth of matters in RFA,
Set One admitted. Both motions requested an award of monetary sanctions in the
amount of $2,560.
On December 14, 2021,
the Shiri Defendants filed nearly identical motions to set aside the entries of
default entered against them in the Lead Case.
On January 14, 2022,
the Court consolidated the Lead Case and the Santa Monica Case.
On April 14, 2022, the
Court ruled that the Shiri Defendants’ demurrer was a legal nullity based on
their defaulted status in the Lead Case at the time of filing.
On June 1, 2022, Shiri
Law’s motions related to FROGs, Set One, and RFAs, Set One, came before the
Court, at which time the Court continued the hearing on these motions to July
25, 2022—the same date for the hearing for the Shiri Defendants’ motions to set
aside.
On July 25, 2022, the
Court granted the Shiri Defendants’ motions to set aside their defaults in the
Lead Case. The Court also granted, in part, Shiri Law’s motions related
to FROGs, Set One, and RFAs, Set One, while specifically denying sanctions. The
minutes for July 25, 2022, do not clarify the meaning of the partial grant of Shiri
Law’s motions, nor does the record reflect a signed order clarifying the
meaning of the July 25, 2022, minutes.
C. Motions Before the Court
On March 29, 2024, Shiri Law filed
motions to compel initial responses to FROGs, Set One, and to deem the truth of
matters in RFAs, Set One, admitted. Both motions seek $2,560 in monetary
sanctions against Plaintiff and/or counsel and attach a proof of service
showing service of the motion was effected by mail on Plaintiff’s counsel and
on Plaintiff “in pro per.”
No opposition, reply,
or notice of non-opposition appear in the record.
Shiri Law’s March 20,
2024, motions are now before the Court.
 
II. Court’s Determination, March 29, 2024, Motions: DENIED,
without prejudice.
The Court DENIES Shiri Law’s
motions, without prejudice.
A review of the March 29, 2024,
motions shows that that they are identical to the motions previously filed by
Shiri Law on November 16, 2021, other than as to filing dates.
The Court ruled on Shiri Law’s
November 16, 2021, motions on July 25, 2022.
For these reasons, by filing the March
29, 2024, motions, Shiri Law is in effect asking for the same relief she has
already been granted, or different relief based on the same facts; a motion governed
by the statute regarding motions for reconsideration. (See Code Civ. Proc., §
1008.)
A trial court may construe a motion
bearing one label as a different type of motion. (Austin v. Los Angeles
Unified School Dist. (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 918, 930.) “‘The nature of a
motion is determined by the nature of the relief sought, not by the label
attached to it. The law is not a mere game of words. … The principle that a
trial court may consider a motion regardless of the label placed on it by a
party is consistent with the court’s inherent authority to manage and control
its docket.’ [Citation.]” (Ibid.) 
Here, Shiri Law’s March 29, 2024,
motions ask for the same relief as those motions brought and granted by this
Court in its July 25, 2022, ruling. To construe the March 29th motions as
motions brought in the first instance would require this Court to ignore the
fact that any order this Court could make disposing of the March 29, 2024, motions
would necessarily conflict with the Court’s July 25, 2022, order on the same
subject matter.
Motions pursuant to section 1008
must be brought within 10 days of the ruling that is being challenged. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (a).) Here, the challenged ruling is the Court’s July
25, 2022, ruling. Given that Shiri Law’s motions were filed on March 29, 2024—well
beyond 10 days after July 25, 2022—the Court determines that Shiri Law’s motions
are untimely.
Shiri Law’s March 29, 2024, motions
are thus DENIED.
The Court notes, however, that this
denial is without prejudice.
Because Shiri Law’s March 29, 2024,
motions are identical to those filed on November 16, 2021, they provide the
Court with no explanation of why Shiri Law is again seeking the same relief
from this Court. It may be that Shiri Law is asking for a clarification of the
Court’s July 25, 2022, order, which does not clarify what the grant “in part”
of the order entails. If this is the intent of the March 29, 2024, motions,
that is not clear from their content.

General, Set No. 1
Law Offices of Robeert R. Shiri,
APC’s Motion to Compel Answers to Form Interrogatories, and Request for

B. Request for Admissions, Set
No. One
Law Offices of Robeert R. Shiri,
APC’s Motion to Deem Request for Admissions Admitted, and Request for Monetary
Sanctions in the Amount of $2,560.00 Against Lenny K. Dykstra and/or Attorneys
of Record is DENIED, without prejudice.
