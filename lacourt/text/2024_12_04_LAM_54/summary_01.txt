As for the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the motions to compel deposition of third-party witnesses Drew Martinez, Javier Jamarilo, and Victor Lares. The witnesses are ordered to appear for deposition within 45 days of notice of ruling, and the parties are ordered to meet and confer regarding dates. The Court declines to award sanctions because the papers do not state how the deponents are related to this action and because Defendants' objections to the production of documents are substantially justified.
