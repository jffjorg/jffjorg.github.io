  Case Number:  24AHCV00190    Hearing Date:   October 8, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING MOTION
TO DEEM REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION ADMITTED AS MOOT AND AWARDING SANCTIONSI.         INTRODUCTION
This action arises from a breach of
contract dispute between Plaintiff and Cross Defendant Bronco Entertainment,
Inc. (“Bronco”) and Defendant and Cross-Complainant Hansen Dam Equestrian
Center, LLC (“Hansen”). The dispute is about a sublicense agreement that
allowed Bronco to present live entertainment at Hansen’s facility, which Hansen
terminated effective December 29, 2021. Following the termination, Bronco
initiated this action.
On June 20, 2024, Hansen served
Bronco with Requests for Admissions (RFAs) Set One. The responses were due by
July 22, 2024. The Parties agreed to extend the deadline, yet Bronco did not
serve responses until September 25, 2024.
Hansen moves to have the RFAs Set
One admitted and requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,000 for
failure to provide timely responses.
Moving Party’s Position
Hansen moves to deem admitted the
RFAs Set One served on Bronco on June 20, 2024. The responses were due on July
22, 2024. However, Bronco failed to serve timely responses. Hansen also seeks
monetary damages in the amount of $3,000, representing attorney fees and costs
incurred due to Bronco’s failure to respond.
Opposition
Bronco opposes this motion,
asserting that it provided responses to RFAs Set One on September 25, 2024,
prior to the hearing on this motion. Bronco asserts that the delay was due to
difficulties in obtaining verification following the death of the principal
operator, Jose De Los Santos, and the subsequent transition in management.
Bronco contends that sanctions should not be imposed, as the responses were
served before the hearing on this matter.      
 
            II.        REQUESTS
FOR ADMISSIONS 
“Any party may obtain discovery . . . by a written request that any other
party to the action admit the genuineness of specified documents, or the truth
of specified matters of fact, opinion relating to fact, or application of law
to fact. A request for admission may relate to a matter that is in controversy
between the parties.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.010.)¿ “Within 30 days after
service of requests for admission, the party to whom the requests are directed
shall serve the original of the response to them on the requesting party, and a
copy of the response on all other parties who have appeared . . . .”¿ (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.250(a).)  
If a party to whom request for admissions are served fails to provide a
timely response, the party to whom the request was directed waives any
objections, including based on privilege or the work product doctrine. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(a).) The requesting party can move for an order that the
genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
request be deemed admitted, as well as for monetary sanctions. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280(b).) The court shall issue this order unless the party to
whom the request was made serves a response in substantial compliance prior to
the hearing on the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(c).) 
Hansen served its RFAs on June 20, 2024, making Bronco’s responses due by
July 22, 2024. (White Decl., ¶ 4, Exh. A.) On August 13, 2024, Hansen granted
Bronco’s request for an extension to respond until August 19, 2024, and
subsequently extended the deadline again to August 23, 2024. (Exh. B.) Bronco
failed to serve timely responses by the agreed-upon dates, prompting Hansen to
file this motion. However, on September 25, 2024, before the hearing on this
motion, Bronco served Hansen with responses to RFAs Set One. (McKinniss Decl.,
¶¶ 5-6.)
Since Bronco served responses before the hearing, Hansen’s motion to deem
matters admitted is moot. As per CCP section 2033.280(c), the court is required
to deny the motion to deem admitted the RFAs. 
Accordingly, Hansen’s request to deem the RFAs admitted is DENIED.
Sanctions
Sanctions are mandatory against the party, the attorney, or both whose
failure to serve a timely response to the request necessitated the motion to
deem request for admissions as admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(c); see
also Cal. Rules of Court R. 3.1348(a) [the court can award sanctions under
the Discovery Act in favor of a party seeking to compel discovery even though
no opposition was filed, the opposition was withdrawn, or the requested
discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed].) 
Here, Bronco failed to timely serve responses to RFAs, Set One, by the
July 22, 2024, deadline. Despite an agreed extension to August 23, 2024, Bronco
did not provide responses until September 25, 2024, after Hansen had filed this
motion. Although the Court finds the motion to deem the RFAs admitted moot due
to Bronco's eventual compliance, sanctions are mandatory under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.280(c). 
The Court also considers the mitigating factors provided by Bronco
regarding the delay in serving responses. Specifically, Bronco's counsel cited
the death of Bronco's principal operator, Jose De Los Santos, and the
subsequent transition in management as contributing to the delay. These factors
mitigate, but do not eliminate, the necessity for sanctions.
Hansen requests $3,000 in sanctions, claiming that 7 hours were spent in
securing compliance and preparing and filing the motion papers. Hansen also
seeks an additional 3 hours of fees for future work. The Court finds this
request excessive, particularly given that Hansen’s counsel has 45 years of
experience. A motion of this nature should not reasonably require 7 hours of
attorney time.
The Court finds that an appropriate amount of time to prepare and file
this motion is 2.5 hours, billed at Hansen counsel's rate of $275 per hour.
Accordingly, the Court awards Hansen monetary sanctions in the amount of
$687.50.
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Hansen’s request for sanctions in part,
awarding $687.50 for 2.5 hours of preparation. 
IV.       CONCLUSION AND ORDER
            Motion by Hansen
for an Order to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted Set One is DENIED. Motion
by Hansen for an order compelling sanction of $687.50 is GRANTED. Bronco is
ordered to pay sanctions to Hansen within 30 days of this order. Hansen is ordered to provide notice
of this order.Dated: October 8, 2024 JARED D. MOSES JUDGE OF THE SUPERIOR COURT
