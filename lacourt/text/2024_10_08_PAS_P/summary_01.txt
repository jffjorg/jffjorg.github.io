And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has denied Hansen's motion to deem the Requests for Admissions (RFAs) Set One admitted, as Bronco has since provided responses to the RFAs. However, the Judge has ordered Bronco to pay sanctions to Hansen in the amount of $687.50 for failing to respond timely to the RFAs. The sanctions are mandatory under California Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280(c) and are intended to punish Bronco for its failure to comply with the discovery process. The Judge has also rejected Hansen's request for $3,000 in sanctions, finding that the amount requested is excessive.
