 Case Number:  23SMCV03182    Hearing Date:   February 8, 2024    Dept:  205 Case Number: 23SMCV03182   Hearing Date: February 7, 2024     Dept: 205   Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District  Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205  FLEMING CONSTRUCTION BUILDING GROUP, INC.,   Plaintiff, v.  KIMBERLY COOPER, et al.,    Defendants.    Case No.:  23SMCV03182     Hearing Date:  February 8, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:   PLAINTIFF/CROSS-DEFENDANT    FLEMING CONSTRUCTION BUILDING    GROUP, INC.’S DEMURRER AND    MOTION TO STRIKE FIRST AMENDED    CROSS-COMPLAINT      This hearing is on Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Fleming Construction Building Group, Inc.’s (“Fleming’s”) demurrer and motion to strike the First Amended Cross-Complaint filed by Defendant/Cross-Plaintiff Kimberly Cooper.   Code Civ. Proc. §§ 430.41 and 435.5 requires that before the filing of a demurrer or motion to strike, the moving party “shall meet and confer in person or by telephone” with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer or motion to strike for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.  (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 430.41(a), 435.5(a).)  The parties are to meet and confer at least five days before the date the responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 430.41(a)(2), 435.5(a)(2).)  Thereafter, the moving party shall file and serve a declaration detailing its meet and confer efforts.  (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 430.41(a)(3), 435.5(a)(3).)   Fleming submits the Declaration of James Devine which fails to show the parties met and conferred “in person or by telephone.”  Rather, Defendants sent counsel for Plaintiff a letter by email.  For this reason, the Court will continue the hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike, so that Fleming can comply with the requirements of Sections 430.41 and 435.5.  The hearing is continued to March 14, 2024 at 9:00 a.m.    IT IS SO ORDERED.  DATED: February 8, 2024    ___________________________ Edward B.
