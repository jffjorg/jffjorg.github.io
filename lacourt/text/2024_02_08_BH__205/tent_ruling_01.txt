  Case Number:  20STCV05703    Hearing Date:   February 8, 2024    Dept:  205 Case Number: 20STCV05703   Hearing Date: February 7, 2024     Dept: 205   Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District  Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205   MEHDI MOHAMMADI,    Plaintiff, v.  GARFIELD BEACH CVS, LLC, et al.,    Defendants.    Case No.:  20STCV05703     Hearing Date:  February 8, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:    DEFENDANTS AUERBACH NATIONAL     SEPULVEDA, LLC AND KENNEDY-    WILSON PROPERTIES, LTD.’S     MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT     OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE FOR     SUMMARY ADJUDICATION     This case arises from an assault and battery of Plaintiff Mehdi Mohammadi outside a CVS store.  Defendants Auerbach National Sepulveda, LLC and Kennedy Wilson Properties Ltd. (“Moving Defendants”) have filed a motion for summary judgment or in the alternative, for summary adjudication.  Moving Defendants’ motion is procedurally defective.  Moving Defendants have not submitted a separate statement as required under Cal. Rules of Court 3.1350(c)(2) and (d).   “The¿separate statement is not merely a technical requirement; it is an indispensable part of the¿summary judgment or adjudication process.  Separate statements are¿required not to satisfy a sadistic urge to torment lawyers,¿but rather to afford due process to opposing parties and to permit trial courts to expeditiously review complex motions for … summary judgment to determine quickly and efficiently whether material facts are disputed.’  (United Community Church v. Garcin¿(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 327, 335.)”  (Whitehead v. Habig¿(2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 896, 902.) Accordingly, because Moving Defendants did not file a separate statement, the Court denies Moving Defendants’ motion for summary judgment or in the alternative, for summary adjudication.  IT IS SO ORDERED.   DATED: February 8, 2024    ___________________________ Edward B.
