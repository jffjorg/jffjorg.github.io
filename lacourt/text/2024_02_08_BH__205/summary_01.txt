And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion for summary judgment or in the alternative for summary adjudication filed by defendants Auerbach National Sepulveda, LLC and Kennedy-Wilson Properties Ltd. The motion was deemed procedurally defective because the defendants failed to submit a separate statement as required by California Rules of Court 3.1350(c)(2) and (d). The Judge cited two previous cases, United Community Church v. Garcin and Whitehead v. Habig, to emphasize the importance of the separate statement in the summary judgment or adjudication process.
