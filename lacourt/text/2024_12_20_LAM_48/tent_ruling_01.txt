  CASE NO.: BC618470
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO BE RELIEVED
  AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
December 20, 2024



 
Armen
M. Tashjian, counsel of record for Plaintiff John B. Cassady, seeks to be relieved
as counsel.  Counsel’s declaration states
that there has been a breakdown of the attorney-client relationship that precludes
counsel from continuing the relationship. 
No party opposed the motion.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motion
complies with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  A new trial following remittitur has not yet been
scheduled, and there is no prejudice to Plaintiff.
The
unopposed motion to be relieved is GRANTED and effective upon filing a proof of
service showing service of the signed Form MC-053 order and this order on John B.
Cassady and all parties who have appeared.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
