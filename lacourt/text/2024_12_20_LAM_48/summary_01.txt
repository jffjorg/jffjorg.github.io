And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that Armen M. Tashjian, counsel for plaintiff John B. Cassady, is granted permission to withdraw from representing Cassady. This decision is based on Tashjian's declaration stating that there has been a breakdown of the attorney-client relationship, which precludes him from continuing to represent Cassady. Since no party opposed the motion, the court has found that absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney's request for withdrawal should be granted. The court has ordered that Tashjian be relieved as counsel and that notice be given to Cassady and all parties who have appeared in the case.
