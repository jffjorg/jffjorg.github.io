  Case Number:  24STCV09680    Hearing Date:   December 20, 2024    Dept:  49 KB Acquisitions, LLC v. Alysanne, LLC, et al. DEMURRER TO CROSS-COMPLAINT MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff and Cross-Defendant KB Acquisitions, LLCRESPONDING PARTY(S): NoneSTATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: Plaintiff KB Acquisitions contracted with Defendants Alysanne, LLC, and Snyder Vine Owner, LLC, to purchase a commercial office building. Around the time of the contemplated purchase, Skims Body, Inc., had signed a lease to occupy the premises. Plaintiff alleges it was a term of the agreement and necessary for financing from its lender that the premises be 70% occupied by Skims. Plaintiff alleges that it discovered that Skims had little, if any, activity at the premises, and therefore did not close the transaction. In response, Defendant Snyder Vine contended that Plaintiff defaulted under the Agreement and that Defendant was entitled to retain Plaintiff’s $5,000,000 deposit. Plaintiff now brings this action for (1) breach of contract and (2) violation of the UCL to recover a portion of its deposit on the failed transaction. Defendants have Cross-Complained against Plaintiff for (1) breach of contract, (2) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and (3) declaratory relief. Cross-Defendant now demurrers to the Complaint. No opposition was filed. TENTATIVE RULING:Cross-Defendant’s Demurrer to the Cross-Complaint is SUSTAINED. Generally speaking, leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment.  (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) Cross-Complainants have not sought leave to amend. In order to be given leave to amend one or more causes of action, they must make a sufficient “offer of proof” at the hearing. Plaintiff is ordered to give notice, unless waived.DISCUSSION:DemurrerI. Meet and ConferThe declaration of Lisa R. Patel, counsel for the moving party, reflects that the meet and confer requirement was satisfied.II. Legal StandardA demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal. App. 4th 740, 747.)  When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context.  (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal. App. 4th 1216, 1228.)  In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or by proper judicial notice.  (CCP § 430.30(a).)  A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters.  (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal. App. 3d 902, 905.)  Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed.  (Id.)  The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.  (Hahn, 147 Cal.App.4th at 747.)III. AnalysisA. Allegations in the ComplaintThis matter arises from Plaintiff Kingsbarn’s agreement to purchase a commercial office building at 1601 Vine Street, Los Angeles, CA, from Defendants Alysanne and Snyder Vine Owner. (Compl. ¶ 7.) Under the PSA and its amendments, Kingsbarn made deposits totaling $5 million in escrow. (Id.)  Section 3(b) of the Third Amendment delineates certain conditions under which Kingsbarn would receive a refund of half of its $5,000,000 deposit. (Id. ¶ 14.) Particularly, Kingsbarn alleges that it “was entitled to be refunded $2,500,000 of its $5,000,000 in total deposits if: (a) by December 28, 2023, Skims was not actively occupying at least seventy percent of the Premises under the Skims Lease (referred to as the “Skims Closing Occupancy”); (b) Kingsbarn’s lender required a new appraisal of the Building prior to closing, and such appraisal was obtained in the first quarter of 2024; (c) the lender appraisal showed a property value of less than 90% of the purchase price in the PSA, as amended; and (d) Kingsbarn notified the Seller that it was electing not to proceed with the purchase and sale transaction within five days of issuance of the lender appraisal.” (Id.)Kingsbarn maintains that Skims was not actively occupying the premises by the closing date and therefore attempted to exercise its rights under the PSA.  (Id. ¶ 19.) In response, Snyder Vine contended that Kingsbarn had failed to close the transaction by the closing date. (Id. ¶ 20.) Kingsbarn “had therefore defaulted under the PSA and Snyder Vine purportedly was entitled to retain the entire $5,000,000 deposit.” (Id.)Kingsbarn contends that all conditions were met under section 3(b) of the PSA. Thus, on March 22, 2024, Plaintiff “provided written notice to Snyder Vine, Alysanne, and their counsel that, pursuant to Section 3(b) of the Third Amendment, Kingsbarn was electing not to proceed with Closing, that escrow should be cancelled, and that $2,500,000 of Kingsbarn’s deposit should be returned to Kingsbarn.” (Id.) Defendant refused to return any portion of the deposit. Kingsbarn therefore filed this action to pursue recovery of the $2,500,000 and its attorney’s fees and costs. (Id. ¶ 24.)B. Allegations in the Cross-ComplaintAlysanne and Snyder Vine have Cross-Complained against Kingsbarn. Cross-Complainants allege that Cross-Defendant breached the Purchase Agreement by not purchasing the Building “because it was financially unable to do so and was unwilling to adopt alternatives for financing the purchase.” (Cross-Compl. ¶ 16.) Cross-Complainants allege that “Cross-Defendant did not close the transaction and now seeks repayment of a deposit to which it knows it is not entitled,” and “[i]n doing so, Cross-Defendant did not act fairly and in good faith.” (Id. ¶ 23.) Cross-Complainants seek judicial declarations [1] “[t]hat the Skims Closing Occupancy occurred before December 28, 2023, as certified by the letter provided by Skims pursuant to Section 3(a) of the Third Amendment to the Purchase Agreement; [2] That Cross-Defendant is not entitled to any portion of its security deposit; and [3] That Cross-Defendant breached the Purchase Agreement and Cross-Complainants are entitled to damages as set forth in Section 16.2 and Section 18.5 of the Original Purchase Agreement.” (Id. ¶ 27.)C. Demurrer to First Cause of Action for Breach of Contract and Second Cause of Action for Breach of Implied CovenantTo prevail on a breach of contract claim, Plaintiff must establish “(1) the existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff's performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant's breach, and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff.” (D'Arrigo Bros. of California v. United Farmworkers of Am. (2014) 224 Cal. App. 4th 790, 800.) Kingsbarn argues the first cause of action fails because the Cross-Complaint does not allege either (1) a breach of contract or (2) damages. This is because the liquidated damages provision contained in Section 16.2—the section of the PSA purportedly breached—provides that Defendant’s sole “sole and exclusive remedy” is “an amount equal to the deposit.” (Cross-Complaint ¶ 5.) Section 16.2 provides:16.2 Default by Buyer. IN THE EVENT THE CLOSE OF ESCROW DOES NOT OCCUR AS HEREIN PROVIDED BY REASON OF ANY DEFAULT OF BUYER, BUYER AND SELLER AGREE THAT IT WOULD BE IMPRACTICAL AND EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE DAMAGES WHICH SELLER MAY SUFFER. THEREFORE BUYER AND SELLER DO HEREBY AGREE THAT A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE TOTAL NET DETRIMENT THAT SELLER WOULD SUFFER IN THE EVENT THAT BUYER DEFAULTS AND FAILS TO COMPLETE THE PURCHASE OF THE PROPERTY IS AND SHALL BE AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE DEPOSIT, TOGETHER WITH THE ACCRUED INTEREST THEREON; AND, AS SELLER’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY (WHETHER AT LAW OR IN EQUITY), SAID AMOUNT SHALL BE DISBURSED TO SELLER AS THE FULL, AGREED AND LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR A BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT BY BUYER WHICH RESULTS IN THE CLOSE OF ESCROW NOT OCCURRING, ALL OTHER CLAIMS TO DAMAGES OR OTHER REMEDIES IN RESPECT OF BUYER’S BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT BEING HEREIN EXPRESSLY WAIVED BY SELLER. SUCH PAYMENT OF THE DEPOSIT IS NOT INTENDED AS A PENALTY, BUT AS FULL LIQUIDATED DAMAGES. NOTHING CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION 16.2 SHALL LIMIT SELLER’S RIGHT TO RECEIVE REIMBURSEMENT FOR COSTS AND EXPENSES PURSUANT TO SECTION 18.5 BELOW, NOR WAIVE OR AFFECT BUYER’S INDEMNITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS.(Cross-Complaint ¶ 5.)The “key fact here,” Alysanne suggests, “is that Defendants already have Kingsbarn’s entire deposit” and have not alleged otherwise. (Dem. 4: 16-25.) Therefore, “[b]ecause Defendants have already received Kingsbarn's entire deposit, they have received all of the compensation to which they are entitled under the PSA.” (Id.)Here, the Cross-Complaint reads and operates like a defense to the allegations in the Complaint more so than any standalone right of action. Based on the allegations and terms PSA—and in the absence of any opposition—the court agrees that Cross-Complainants have failed to allege a breach or damages. Additionally, to the extent the PSA might allow for the recovery of attorney’s fees, such fees are not damages. “In California, ‘attorney's fees qua attorney's fees’ — that is, the fees ‘attributable to the bringing of the ... action itself’ — are not an element of damages.” [Citation.] “Instead, they are defined as ‘costs’.” (Pulliam v. HNL Auto. Inc. (2022) 13 Cal. 5th 127, 141.) Like for breach of contract, an essential element for breach of the implied covenant is “damages resulting from the breach[].” (Vu v. California Com. Club, Inc. (1997) 58 Cal. App. 4th 229, 233.) As discussed, Cross-Complainants have not alleged any damages from the breach because they received and maintained the $5 million deposit. Therefore, the second cause of action also fails.Accordingly, Cross-Defendant’s Demurrer to the First and Second Causes of Action is SUSTAINED. Generally speaking, leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment.  (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) Cross-Complainants have not sought leave to amend. In order to be given leave to amend one or more causes of action, they must make a sufficient “offer of proof” at the hearing. D. Demurrer to Third Cause of Action for Declaratory ReliefCross-Complainants seek judicial declarations [1] “[t]hat the Skims Closing Occupancy occurred before December 28, 2023, as certified by the letter provided by Skims pursuant to Section 3(a) of the Third Amendment to the Purchase Agreement; [2] That Cross-Defendant is not entitled to any portion of its security deposit; and [3] That Cross-Defendant breached the Purchase Agreement and Cross-Complainants are entitled to damages as set forth in Section 16.2 and Section 18.5 of the Original Purchase Agreement.” (Cross-Complaint ¶ 27.)A court may refuse to issue a judicial declaration “in any case where its declaration or determination is not necessary or proper at the time under all the circumstances.” (CCP § 1061; (Schessler v. Keck (1954) 125 Cal. App. 2d 827, 837 [A judicial declaration is unnecessary when “[a]n adjudication upon the issues raised” in the other causes of action “would fully and adequately determine all matters actually in controversy between the parties.”].)Kingsbarn argues the request for declaratory relief is not necessary or proper because it seeks the same relief that Kingsbarn seeks in its Complaint for breach of contract. Kingsbarn is correct. To properly adjudicate the underlying breach of contract in Kingsbarn’s Complaint, this court will necessarily need to address the exact issues on which Cross-Defendants seek declarations. Therefore, Cross-Complaints’ declaratory relief cause of action is duplicative and serves no practical purpose.Accordingly, Cross-Defendant’s Demurrer to the Third Cause of Action is SUSTAINED without leave to amend.IT IS SO ORDERED.Dated:   December 20, 2024 ___________________________________ Randolph M.
