Here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion of Defendant Yapstone Holdings, Inc.'s counsel, Theresa A. Kristovich, to be relieved as counsel. The motion was made because of a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and Defendant Yapstone's failure to adhere to the material terms of its retainer agreement. The judge found that Attorney Kristovich complied with the Rules of Court by filing the required forms and providing adequate explanation for why she is moving to be relieved as counsel. The notice to the client was provided via mail, and the client has not opposed the motion, indicating that there is adequate time to retain new counsel. The judge granted the motion, allowing Attorney Kristovich to be relieved as counsel.
