And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the motion to compel arbitration filed by the defendants, The Cheesecake Factory Inc. and The Cheesecake Factory Restaurant Inc. The motion was filed in response to the plaintiff, Lizbeth Parra's, employment action against the defendants. The defendants sought to compel arbitration of the plaintiff's claims, including allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault, and to stay the action while arbitration is pending.

The judge found that the defendants failed to demonstrate that the arbitration agreement is enforceable. The agreement was executed in 2021, but the Ending the Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021 (EFAA) applies to disputes that arise or accrue on or after its date of enactment, March 3, 2022. The plaintiff's claims, including the sexual harassment and sexual assault allegations, are subject to the EFAA and are non-arbitrable.

The judge also rejected the defendants' argument that the EFAA only applies to the sexual harassment-related claims and that the other claims must be compelled to arbitration. The judge found that the EFAA precludes arbitration of all the claims in the Complaint, including the non-sexual harassment claims.
