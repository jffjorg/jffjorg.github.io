And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled in favor of the plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees. The plaintiff is seeking an award of $232,419 in attorney's fees and $3,129.35 in costs. The lease agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant provides for the payment of attorney's fees by the prevailing party. The plaintiff has spent 537.35 hours on this matter over three years, and the hourly rates and billing entries appear reasonable. The plaintiff also provides invoices showing its costs, which are allowable under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5(a). The defendant did not oppose the motion, which amounts to a concession that the motion is meritorious. Therefore, the plaintiff's motion is granted in the amounts requested.
