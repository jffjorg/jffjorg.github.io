Legal Standard
Unless a statute provides for them, (e.g., Code of Civil Procedure
sections 1032, et seq.), the measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and
counselors at law is left to the agreement, express or implied, of the
parties.¿(Code Civ. Proc., section 1021.)¿ The prevailing party on a contract,
which specifically provides for attorney fees and costs incurred to enforce the
agreement, is entitled to reasonable attorney fees in addition to other costs.¿
(Civ. Code, section 1717, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., sections 1032;
1033.5, subd. (a)(10)(A).)¿
The court, upon notice and motion by a party, shall determine the prevailing
party and shall fix, as an element of the costs of suit, the reasonable
attorney fees.¿ (Civ. Code, section 1717, subds. (a), (b).)¿ A party moving for
attorneys’ fees as an element of costs shall serve and file the notice before
or at the same time the party serves and files the memorandum of costs; if only
attorney fees are claimed as costs, the party shall serve and file the notice
within the time specified in the Rules of Court, Rule 3.1700 for filing a
memorandum of costs.¿ (Cal. Rules Court. 3.1702; Gunlock Corp. v. Walk on
Water, Inc. (1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 1301, 1303, fn. 1.)¿¿¿  ¿¿¿ 
“It is well established that
the determination of what constitutes reasonable attorney fees is committed to
the discretion of the trial court, whose decision cannot be reversed in the
absence of an abuse of discretion.”¿ (Melnyk v. Robledo (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d
618, 623 624.) The fee setting inquiry in California ordinarily “begins with
the ‘lodestar’ [method], i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended
multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.”¿ (Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales,
Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.)¿ “[A] computation of time spent on a
case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a determination of
an appropriate attorneys’ fee award.”¿ (Margolin v. Reg’l Planning Comm’n
(1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004.)¿ The court may then adjust the lodestar
figure based on consideration of factors specific to the case, to fix the fee
at the fair market value for the legal services provided.¿ (See Serrano v.
Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49 [discussing factors relevant to proper attorneys’
fees award].)¿  
Discussion
Here, attorney’s fees are authorized by the lease
between Plaintiff and Kumar. Specifically, the lease agreement provides that if
any “Party…brings an action or proceeding involving the Premises whether
founded in tort, contract or equity…the Prevailing Party in any such
proceeding, action, or appeal thereon, shall be entitled to reasonable
attorney’s fees…In addition, Subless” (Kim Decl., Exh. A at ¶¶11 of Sublease.)
Additionally, “the prevailing party…shall be entitled to recover all costs and
expenses incurred…including court costs, expert witness fees and reasonable
attorneys’ and legal assistants’ fees, prior to and during such action or
proceeding, on appeal and for post judgment proceedings, including enforcement
and collection thereof.” (Id., ¶ 15(c) of Master Sublease.)  
Plaintiff is the prevailing party here because it
obtained judgment in its favor and is therefore entitled to attorney’s fees and
costs. Plaintiff properly provides a detailed account of its’ counsel’s
billing. Plaintiff’s six attorneys and one litigation support analyst spent
537.35 hours on this matter over three years for a total of $232,419. (Kim
Decl., ¶18, Exhs. D, E.) Counsels’ hourly rates and billing entries appear
reasonable. (Id., ¶¶19-26, Exh. D, E.) 
Plaintiff also provides invoices showing its costs
totaled $3,129.35 for filing and motion fees, deposition costs, and service of
process. (Id., Exh. C.) Plaintiff’s costs are allowable under Code Civ.
Proc., section 1033.5(a). 
Kumar did not oppose this motion and thus did not
challenge Plaintiff’s request for fees and costs. That lack of an opposition
amounts to a concession that the motion is meritorious. (See California Rules
of Court Rule 3.1113(a); see also Rule 3.1320(f); Herzberg v. County of
Plumas (2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 1, 20 (the party who fails to
argue an issue abandons that issue).) Therefore, here, Plaintiff’s motion is
granted in the amounts requested.
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s motion for attorney’s fees is GRANTED.
