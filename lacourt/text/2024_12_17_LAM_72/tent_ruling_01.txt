Defendants (in non-lead case) Regal Medical Group, Inc.
(“Regal Medical Group”) and Lakeside Medical Organization, A Medical Group,
Inc. (“Lakeside”) (collectively, “Regal”) move for an award of attorney’s fee
and costs against Plaintiff (in non-lead case) Advanced Orthopedic Center, Inc.
(“AOC”) pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, section 425.15, subd. (c)(1).
Regal seeks an award of $210,627.48.
 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion in the amount of $155,225.98.
 
Background
 
This action arises out of a medical fee dispute between AOC and
Regal.
 
The Regal Parties are an independent physician association
that works with health care insurers to coordinate care for their insureds and
assumes the financial risk of providing physician care services to those
insureds. Jonathan Nissanoff, M.D., a defendant in the lead case, is a
physician and the sole owner of AOC. Nissanoff offers orthopedic medical
services. Nissanoff and AOC are not “in-network” with Regal.
 
On October 3, 2019, a patient that the parties refer to as
“Patient 5” presented at Nissanoff’s practice. Nissanoff examined Patient 5 for
an issue relating to the patient’s foot. After the appointment, Nissanoff took
a $500.00 deposit from Patient 5. (7/29/2024 Nissanoff Decl. in Support of
AOC’s Opposition to Opening Brief (“Nissanoff Decl.”) ¶ 11.) Nissanoff
explained to Patient 5 that all or part of the deposit would be returned once
Regal had paid Patient 5’s claim. (Nissanoff Decl. ¶ 11.) Nissanoff billed
Regal for $1,716.00 for his services to Patient 5. (Nissanoff Decl. ¶ 13.)
 
Regal paid AOC a total of $150.33 for Nissanoff’s services
and assigned an additional $40.00 to patient responsibility. (Nissanoff Decl. ¶
14.) Because AOC had not been paid in full, it retained the $500.00 deposit.
(Nissanoff Decl. ¶ 14.)
 
In 2020, AOC filed a small claims lawsuit in the Los Angeles
Superior Court against Regal seeking payment of the full $1,716.00 charge.
(Nissanoff Decl. ¶ 15.) The case was tried, and judgment was entered in favor
of AOC for the amount requested. (Nissanoff Decl. ¶ 15.) Regal filed an appeal
and obtained a de novo trial, which would eventually occur on March 7, 2022.
 
In the meantime, on October 30, 2022, Regal sued Nissanoff
and AOC for violating the Unfair Competition Law (Bus. & Prof. Code, §
17200 et seq.) and for fraud, unjust enrichment, and declaratory relief. That
lawsuit is the lead case in this action. Regal alleged, inter alia, that
Nissanoff billed for emergency services when there was no emergency.
 
On August 24, 2021, AOC filed a separate lawsuit, which was
consolidated with the lead case in this action and now forms the basis for
Regal’s anti-SLAPP motion. AOC originally raised claims for quantum meruit and
breach of contract, contending that it was entitled to receive payment based on
its total billed charges.  The
allegations at issue in the current anti-SLAPP motion were not included in the
original complaint.
 
According to the declaration of Regal’s vice president of
legal affairs, Mary Coash, Regal had “a strict policy against providers
‘balance billing’ patients, i.e., collecting money from the patient that is
above the patient’s financial responsibility.” (Coash Decl. in Support of
Anti-SLAPP Motion (“Coash Decl.”) ¶ 2.) 
 
On January 24, 2022, slightly over a month before the second
trial stemming from AOC’s small claims action, Coash spoke with Patient 5.
(Coash Decl. ¶ 3.) Although Coash declares that Patient 5 stated that Nissanoff
had required the $500.00 deposit as a prerequisite to treatment (Coash Decl. ¶
3.), Patient 5’s statement is not evidenced through declarations from Patient
5, and is therefore inadmissible hearsay. In any event, Coash told Patient 5
that Regal would reimburse him for the $500.00 deposit that Patient 5 had paid
to AOC. (Coash Decl. ¶ 3.) On February 3, 2022, Regal issued a check to patient
5 in the amount of $500.00. (Coash Decl. ¶ 4.)
 
On February 9, 2022, Regal’s counsel in the small claims
case, Michael Amir, had a telephone call with Patient 5 and asked whether
Patient 5 would testify in the then-upcoming March 7, 2022 trial. (Amir Decl.
in Support of Anti-SLAPP Motion (“Amir Decl.”) ¶ 8.) Patient 5 agreed to
provide testimony in the form of a declaration. (Amir Decl. ¶ 8.) On February
11, 2022, Amir sent Patient 5 an email providing a draft declaration for
Patient 5’s review and signature. (Amir Decl. ¶ 8, Ex. 5.) Amir’s email requested
that Patient 5 make sure that all the statements were accurate. (Amir Decl. ¶
8, Ex. 5, Part 1.) Amir’s email also noted that Regal had reimbursed Patient 5
for the $500.00 deposit and stated that “as [Amir] said yesterday, the
statements in the declaration should in no way be impacted by the reimbursement
check. You are entitled to the check, with or without your assistance.”
(Amir Decl. ¶ 8, Ex. 5, Part 1 [emphasis in original].)
 
During the de novo trial, Regal’s counsel disclosed the
$500.00 payment that Regal had made to Patient 5.  (Nissanoff Decl. ¶ 21.)  Regal asserted that the payment was
reimbursement of the $500.00 deposit that Nissanoff had taken from Patient 5.
The Court entered judgment in the amount of $1,716.00 in AOC’s favor but also
ordered AOC to refund $500.00 to Patient 5.
 
On May 9, 2022, AOC filed the SAC in the non-lead case in
this action, adding claims for unfair competition and for declaratory relief.
These claims were based in part on allegations that Regal’s $500.00 payment to
Patient 5 violated California’s bribery statute (Pen . Code, § 137) and the
federal anti-gratuity statute (18 U.S.C. § 201(c)(2).)
 
On June 20, 2022, Regal moved to strike allegations related
to the bribery and gratuity theories under Code of Civil Procedure, section
425.16. This is the anti-SLAPP motion that is now at issue. On August 2, 2022,
the Court denied the anti-SLAPP motion. In reaching its ruling, the Court found
that neither Penal Code, section 137 nor 18 U.S.C. section 201(c)(2) require
the actual procurement of false testimony, but only payment and corresponding
intent. The Court therefore concluded that AOC’s allegations of false testimony
merely served as evidence of liability, and did not comprise the wrongful act
complained of, which the Court found was the allegedly illegal payment. The
Court therefore found that the basis of AOC’s claims was not protected
activity.
 
Regal appealed the denial of its anti-SLAPP motion. The
Court of Appeal affirmed in part and reversed the Court’s finding of
non-protected activity as to paragraph 11 (except for the portions that state
“despite the lack of any legitimate health care or business justification for
doing so” and “drafted entirely by Defendants or their attorneys, containing
outright misrepresentations and falsehoods about AOC’s business practices”),
the first sentence of paragraph 91, paragraphs 94, 95, 115(g) and (h), 118, 119,
and subparagraph 4(e) of AOC’s declaratory relief claim. (Remittitur at p. 28.)

 
The Court of Appeal noted that “[a]cts undertaken to obtain
or shape witness testimony are protected activity” (Remittitur at p. 20) and
determined that “[t]he allegations at issue state, and require as elements to
establish liability, payment with the intent of procuring favorable testimony
coupled with Regal having indicated to Patient 5 that payment was offered to
influence his testimony.” (Remittitur at p. 24.)
 
The Court of Appeal directed the Court to determine whether
AOC met its burden of demonstrating a reasonable probability of prevailing on
the merits of its claims at trial with respect to those portions of the SAC.
(Remittitur at p. 28.)
 
On May 30, 2024, the Court set a hearing for the
determination of the merits issue and ordered additional briefing by the
parties. Regal filed an opening brief on June 28, 2024. AOC filed an opposition
on July 29, 2024. Regal filed a reply on August 6, 2024.
 
On August 13, 2024, the Court granted Regal’s anti-SLAPP
motion as to the allegations identified by the Court of Appeal.
 
On October 11, Regal filed this motion for attorney’s fees.
AOC filed an opposition and Regal filed a reply.
 
Evidentiary Objections
 
The Court overrules Regal’s objections to the Nissanoff
Declaration.
 
Legal Standard
 
A defendant who prevails on an anti-SLAPP motion is
generally entitled to recover attorney fees and costs. (Code Civ. Proc., §
425.16, subd. (c)(1).)
 
Attorney’s fees in anti-SLAPP motions are determined using
the lodestar method. (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.) “Under
the lodestar method, the trial court must first determine the lodestar
figure—the reasonable hours spent multiplied by the reasonable hourly
rate—based on a careful compilation of the time spent and reasonable hourly
compensation of each attorney involved in the presentation of the case.” (Glaviano
v. Sacramento City Unified School Dist. (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 744,
751.) 
 
The trial court has broad authority to determine the amount
of a reasonable fee. (PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th
1084, 1095.)  
 
The moving party bears the burden of proof as to
“reasonableness” of any fee claim. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(5).)
The party seeking fees has the burden of documenting the appropriate hours
expended and hourly rates. (City of Colton v. Singletary (2012) 206
Cal.App.4th 751, 784.) This burden requires competent evidence as to the nature
and value of the services rendered. (Martino v. Denevi (1986) 182
Cal.App.3d 553, 559.) A plaintiff’s verified billing invoices are prima
facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and services listed were necessarily
incurred. (Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682.) 
 
“In challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many
hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point
to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to
the evidence. General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative,
or unrelated do not suffice.” (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230
Cal.App.4th 459, 488, quoting Premier Med. Mgmt. Sys., Inc. v. California
Ins. Guarantee Ass’n (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.) When items are
properly objected to, the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as
costs. (Melnyk v. Robledo (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618, 623-624.)
 
Discussion
 
Entitlement to Fees and Costs
 
Regal prevailed on its anti-SLAPP motion as to a portion of
the SAC.
 
AOC argues that Regal’s attorney fee recovery should be
denied because Regal only obtained an order striking limited portions of the
SAC. The Court disagrees.
 
“[T]he anti-SLAPP statute does not refer to parties that
have “prevail[ed]” in a lawsuit; it refers specifically to defendants that have
prevailed ‘on [the] special motion to strike.’ (Code Civ. Proc., §
425.16, subd. (c)(1), italics added.) A defendant that successfully moves to
strike a plaintiff’s cause of action, whether on merits or nonmerits grounds,
has ‘prevailed’ on the motion, and therefore is entitled to attorney's fees and
costs under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16, subdivision (c). This
understanding of the scope of the anti-SLAPP's fee-shifting provision is
consistent with its apparent purpose: namely, compensating the prevailing
defendant for the undue burden of defending against litigation designed to
chill the exercise of free speech and petition rights.” (Barry v. State Bar
of California (2017) 2 Cal.5th 318, 327–328 [emphasis in original].)
 
Here, Regal successfully obtained an order striking AOC’s
allegations that Regal bribed Patient 5. This included striking AOC’s 
 
Regal is therefore entitled to recover attorney’s fees and
costs.
 
Amount of Award
 
Regal seeks a total fee award of $210,627.48.
 
The Court has reviewed the hourly rates for Regal’s
attorneys and finds them to be reasonable.
 
Regal provides the billing records for its attorneys, as
well as several charts breaking the fees down by month, attorney, and type of
task. (Amir Decl., Ex. 1, 2.) 
 
The time expenditures by Regal’s attorneys did not result
from a typical anti-SLAPP motion alone. These hours include briefing and
argument on the original motion, opposition to AOC’s motion for attorney’s fees
when the original motion was denied, time spent on appeal (including in
opposing AOC’s cross-appeal), briefing and argument at the trial court
following remand, and Plaintiff’s motion for attorney’s fees. Thus, the large
size of the fee request does not appear inherently unreasonable. However, the
Court makes some reductions as discussed below.
 
AOC argues that the anti-SLAPP motion had a minimal benefit
to Regal in this litigation, and that the fee award should therefore be
reduced. In essence, AOC contends that, while the Court and the Court of Appeal
struck AOC’s explicit allegations of bribery, there remain allegations
in the SAC which functionally state all of the elements of bribery. The Court
of Appeal disagreed, and this Court does too. “Because efforts to obtain and
shape testimony are protected activities, … protected activity forms the basis
for the bribery and anti-gratuity claims. AOC cannot omit [the stricken
allegations] and still state a claim” for bribery. (Remittitur at pp. 24-24.)
 
Further, although the change in potential damages resulting
from the anti-SLAPP motion will likely be small, it succeeded in eliminating
the only criminal claim against Regal in an otherwise civil case. The strategic
effect of the anti-SLAPP motion thus went beyond the mere change in damages,
and also includes potential effects on Regal’s business reputation.
 
The Court does believe that AOC has not demonstrated that
certain of the hour expenditures are reasonable. Jason Baim billed 76.80 hours
for trial court briefing and oral arguments following remittitur, in addition
to 10.20 hours spent by Lloyd Vu, 4.30 hours by Michael Amir, and 2.7 hours by
Mary Glarum. This time was in addition to 84.80 hours on the appeal by Baim and
85.30 hours on the appeal by Lloyd Vu. This case involved complex issues on
both appeal and remand. However, the time spent on remand is excessive when
considering how much time was invested in preparing these issues on appeal. There
were also inefficiencies on appeal, with multiple attorneys, and in opposing
the original fee motion. The Court makes a number of reductions to bring the
hours in line with what it considers reasonable under the circumstances.
 
The Court grants Regal’s motion. The Court reduces Mr.
Baim’s hours for trial court briefing following remand from 76.80 to 35. The
Court reduces the time spent on this motion for attorney’s fees to 25.30 to 15.
The Court reduces Mr. Baim’s hours on appeal from 84.80 to 64.80. The Court
reduces Mr. Vu’s hours on appeal from 85.30 to 65.30. The Court reduces Mr.
Baim’s hours opposing Plaintiff’s fee motion from 36.20 to 15.
 Based on the hourly rates provided, the Court reduces the
fee award by $55,401.50. The Court therefore awards $155,225.98.
