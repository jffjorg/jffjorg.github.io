 Hearing Date:  December 17, 2024
 Calendar Number:  9



 
 
 
Defendant Lynwood Unified School District (“LUSD”) demurs to
the FAC filed by Plaintiff Latrice Harris. 
 
The Court SUSTAINS the demurrer to the sixth claim.
Plaintiff may file a motion for leave to amend as to the sixth claim, but may
not amend as a matter of right. 
 
The Court OVERRULES the demurrer to the remaining claims.
 
Background
 
This is an employment case. The following facts are taken
from the allegations of the FAC, which the Court accepts as true for purposes
of the demurrer.
 
Plaintiff worked for LUSD from 2017 to 2023 as a Benefit and
Payroll Manager and Benefit and Risk Manager.
 
Plaintiff alleges that from around August 2022 until June
2023, Plaintiff was subject to discrimination based on race and color by her
supervisor Brenda Romero. Plaintiff alleges that Romero called her derogatory
terms, including racial slurs, and encouraged other employees to file meritless
complaints against Plaintiff. Plaintiff alleges that Romero told Plaintiff that
Romero was going to get Plaintiff fired or make Plaintiff’s working conditions
intolerable.
 
Plaintiff alleges that LUSD constructively terminated her in
June 2023.
 
Plaintiff alleges that in October 2001, Ms. Rodriguez, a
candidate for the LUSD school board who was later elected to the board, told
the board that their job was to get rid of black people, using a racial slur.
Plaintiff alleges that since the time of Rodriguez’s election to the board,
LUSD has targeted black employees in the district for harassment, intimidation,
removal, and demotion based on their race.
 
Plaintiff filed this action against LUSD and Romero on
January 10, 2024, raising claims for (1) discrimination based on race; (2)
discrimination based on color; (3) retaliation in violation of FEHA; (4)
failure to prevent discrimination, harassment, and retaliation; and (5)
intentional infliction of emotional distress (“IIED”).
 
LUSD demurred to the complaint on July 23, 2024. The hearing
date was set for August 15, 2024. Plaintiff did not file an opposition prior to
August 15, 2024. On August 13, 2024, two days before the scheduled hearing,
Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (the “Rejected FAC”) which attempted
to cure certain defects raised in the demurrer and added a sixth claim for
negligent supervision, retention, and hiring.
 
On August 15, 2024, Plaintiff did not appear at the hearing
because Plaintiff’s counsel assumed that the FAC would moot the demurrer and
that the demurrer would therefore be taken off calendar. Plaintiff’s counsel
had another hearing on the same day, which ran the full day. The Court
continued the hearing to August 29, 2024.
 
On August 22, 2024, five court days before the August 29,
2024 hearing, Plaintiff filed an opposition. On August 23, 2024, LUSD filed a
reply.
 
On August 29, 2024, the Court sustained LUSD’s demurrer to
the first, second, third, and fourth claims as to Romero without leave to amend
and dismissed Romero from the action as a defendant. The Court noted that those
claims stand against LUSD, which did not demur to them on its own behalf. The
Court sustained LUSD’s demurrer to the fifth claim as to itself with leave to
amend. The Court stated that Plaintiff would have to seek leave of court if she
wished to add her claim for negligent supervision, retention, and hiring.
 
On September 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed the FAC, which raises
claims for (1) discrimination based on race; (2) discrimination based on color;
(3) retaliation in violation of FEHA; (4) failure to prevent discrimination,
harassment, and retaliation; and (5) intentional infliction of emotional
distress (“IIED”); and (6) negligent supervision, retention, and hiring.
 
Legal Standard
 
As a general matter, in a demurrer proceeding, the defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins.
Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the pleading
alone, and not the evidence or facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants,
Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) The court assumes the truth
of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Ibid.) The only issue a demurrer is
concerned with is whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of
action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
 
Where a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be
allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335,
348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to show the court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Ibid.;
Lewis v. YouTube, LLC (2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) However, “[i]f
there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause
of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).
 
Discussion
 
Discrimination Based on Race – First Claim
 
To establish a claim for discrimination, a plaintiff must
show “that (1) [the plaintiff] was a member of a protected class, (2) [the
plaintiff] was qualified for the position he sought or was performing
competently in the position [they] held, (3) [the plaintiff] suffered an
adverse employment action, such as termination, demotion, or denial of an
available job, and (4) some other circumstance suggests discriminatory motive.”
(Guz v. Bechtel National Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 317, 355.)
 
“A party demurring to a pleading that has been amended after
a demurrer to an earlier version of the pleading was sustained shall not demur
to any portion of the amended complaint, cross-complaint, or answer on grounds
that could have been raised by demurrer to the earlier version of the
complaint, cross-complaint, or answer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41.)
 
Here, LUSD not only previously demurred to the Complaint, it
demurred to this claim – but only on behalf of Romero. LUSD now argues for the
first time that Plaintiff failed to exhaust her administrative remedies as to
her first, second, third, and fourth claims. LUSD failed to raise any arguments
on its own behalf as to this claim. LUSD’s new arguments here are therefore
waived.
 
The Court overrules the demurrer to this claim.
 
Discrimination Based on Color – Second Claim
 
This claim was in the Complaint to which LUSD previously
demurred. LUSD did not raise any arguments against this claim on its own
behalf. LUSD’s new arguments here are therefore waived. (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41.)
 
The Court overrules the demurrer to this claim.
 
 
Retaliation – Third Claim
 
The elements of a cause of action for failure to prevent
harassment or retaliation are: (1) actionable discrimination or harassment by
employees or nonemployees; (2) defendant’s legal duty of care toward plaintiff
(i.e., defendant is the plaintiff’s employer); (3) breach of that duty (i.e.,
failure to take all reasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination and
harassment from occurring); (4) legal causation; and (5) damages to plaintiff.
(Trujillo v. North County Transit
District (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 280, 287, 289; Bradley v. Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation (2008)
158 Cal.App.4th 1612, 1630; Gov. Code, § 12940.)
 
This claim was in the Complaint to which LUSD previously
demurred. LUSD did not raise any arguments against this claim on its own
behalf. LUSD’s new arguments here are therefore waived. (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41.)
 
The Court overrules the demurrer to this claim.
 
Failure to Prevent Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation – Fourth
Claim
 
The elements of a cause of action for failure to prevent
harassment or retaliation are: (1) actionable discrimination or harassment by
employees or nonemployees; (2) defendant’s legal duty of care toward plaintiff
(i.e., defendant is the plaintiff’s employer); (3) breach of that duty (i.e.,
failure to take all reasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination and
harassment from occurring); (4) legal causation; and (5) damages to plaintiff.
(Trujillo v. North County Transit
District (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 280, 287, 289; Bradley v. Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation (2008)
158 Cal.App.4th 1612, 1630; Gov. Code, § 12940.)
 
This claim was in the Complaint to which LUSD previously
demurred. LUSD did not raise any arguments against this claim on its own
behalf. LUSD’s new arguments here are therefore waived. (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41.)
 
The Court overrules the demurrer to this claim.
 
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress – Fifth Claim
 
“The elements of a prima facie case for the tort of
intentional infliction of emotional distress are: (1) extreme and outrageous
conduct by the defendant with the intention of causing, or reckless disregard
of the probability of causing, emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff’s
suffering severe or extreme emotional distress; and (3) actual and proximate
causation of the emotional distress by the defendant’s outrageous conduct.
Conduct to be outrageous must be so extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually
tolerated in a civilized community.” (Wilson
v. Hynek (2012) 207 Cal.App.4th 999, 1009, citation and ellipses omitted.) “Whether
a defendant’s conduct can reasonably be found to be outrageous is a question of
law that must initially be determined by the court; if reasonable persons may
differ, it is for the jury to determine whether the conduct was, in fact,
outrageous.” (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 534.)
 
“[T]here is no common law tort liability for public entities
in California; such liability is wholly statutory.” (In re Groundwater Cases
(2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 659, 688.) “Except as otherwise provided by statute …
[a] public entity is not liable for an injury, whether such injury arises out
of an act or omission of the public entity or a public employee or any other
person.” (Gov. Code, § 815.)
 
“[B]ecause under the Tort Claims Act all governmental tort
liability is based on statute, the general rule that statutory causes of action
must be pleaded with particularity is applicable.” (Lopez v. Southern Cal.
Rapid Transit Dist. (1985) 40 Cal.3d 780, 795.) “This means that, to state
a cause of action against a public entity, every fact material to the existence
of its statutory liability must be pleaded with particularity. (Peter W. v.
San Francisco Unified Sch. Dist. (1976) 60 Cal.App.3d 814, 819.) “Since the
duty of a governmental agency can only be created by statute or ‘enactment,’
the statute or ‘enactment’ claimed to establish the duty must at the very least
be identified.” (Searcy v. Hemet Unified School Dist. (1986) 177
Cal.App.3d 792, 802.)
 
Plaintiff fails to identify a statute setting forth the
applicable duty for her IIED claim.
 
Plaintiff alleges that LUSD can be held liable under
Government Code, section 815.2, subd. (a), which holds public entities liable
for injuries caused by their employees within the scope of employment. LUSD argues
in response that nothing in this statute provides for public entity liability
for IIED. The express language of the statute is not consistent with
Defendant’s argument: “A public entity is liable for injury proximately caused
by an act or omission of an employee of the public entity within the scope of
his employment if the act or omission would, apart from this section, have
given rise to a cause of action against that employee or his personal
representative.” (Gov. Code, § 815.2, subd. (a).)
 
LUSD argues that Plaintiff’s exclusive remedy for this claim
is worker’s compensation. (See Miklosy v. Regents of University of
California (2008) 44 Cal.4th 876, 902.) “So long as the basic conditions of
compensation are otherwise satisfied [citation], and the employer's conduct
neither contravenes fundamental public policy [citation] nor exceeds the risks
inherent in the employment relationship [citation], an employee's emotional
distress injuries are subsumed under the exclusive remedy provisions of workers'
compensation.” (Livitsanos v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.4th 744, 754.)
Here, Plaintiff’s IIED claim rises out of alleged racial discrimination and
harassment, which contravenes public policy. Thus, it is not barred by workers
compensation exclusivity.
 
Defendant argues that none of the alleged conduct rises to
the level of outrageous conduct. Here, Plaintiff alleges that Romero called her
derogatory terms, including racial slurs, and encouraged other employees to
file meritless complaints against Plaintiff. Plaintiff alleges that Romero told
Plaintiff that Romero was going to get Plaintiff fired or make Plaintiff’s
working conditions intolerable. This conduct goes well beyond “ ‘mere insults,
indignities, threats, annoyances, petty oppressions, or other trivialities[.]’
” (Ankeny v. Lockheed Missiles and Space Co. (1979) 88 Cal.App.3d 531,
537)
 
The Court therefore overrules the demurrer to this claim.
 
Negligent Supervision, Retention, and Hiring
 
In sustaining the previous demurrer, the Court stated that
Plaintiff would have to seek leave of court if she wished to add her claim for
negligent supervision, retention, and hiring. Plaintiff has not obtained leave
to amend to raise this claim.
 
The Court therefore sustains the demurrer to this claim.
Plaintiff may seek leave of court to amend.
