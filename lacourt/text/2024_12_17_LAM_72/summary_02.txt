Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer filed by Luis and Maria, as well as the demurrer filed by Aley, in the case involving 10869 Drury Lane Prop, LLC (Plaintiff) and Aley & L Group, Corporation, Luis Del Cid, Maria Del Cid, and Monzon & Son Enterprises, Inc. (Defendants).

The judge has overruled the demurrer to the second claim, which is for trespass, finding that the Plaintiff has adequately alleged the necessary elements to state a cause of action.

The judge has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend as to the third and fourth claims, which are for intentional and negligent interference with prospective economic advantage, respectively. The judge found that the Plaintiff has not adequately alleged the necessary elements to state a cause of action for these claims.

The judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to the fifth claim, which is for unjust enrichment. The judge found that the Plaintiff cannot state a claim against the sublessees, Luis and Maria, as they were not the original lessees and did not have a direct agreement with the Plaintiff.

The judge has given the Plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint to address the defects in the claims that were sustained.
