And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Anitria Michelle Tomlin vs. County of Los Angeles, et al. The ruling concerns a Pitchess motion filed by the defendants, seeking leave to disclose certain law enforcement personnel records, including records of the plaintiff.

The judge has tentatively granted the motion and ordered in camera review of the requested materials. However, the judge has denied the plaintiff's request to be present during the in camera review.

The court has also ordered that any documents ordered produced following the in camera review be produced to all parties under a protective order. The protective order requires that the documents be used only for the purposes of this litigation and must be returned to the County at the conclusion of the case.

The judge's decision is based on the following facts: the plaintiff is a sworn Lieutenant for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department; the fingerprint identification process is a 24/7 operation; the plaintiff reported concerns about understaffing to her superiors; the plaintiff was not paid overtime compensation; and the plaintiff was subject to an internal investigation.

The case involves several disputes, including the plaintiff's claims of whistleblower retaliation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and conspiracy, and the defendants' claims of legitimate business decisions. The judge's decision will likely have significant implications for the case, including the potential disclosure of confidential information and the admissibility of evidence at trial.
