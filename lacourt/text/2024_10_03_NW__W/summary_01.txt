```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted the Plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend their complaint to include allegations of punitive damages against Defendant The Vons Companies, Inc. The Plaintiffs seek to add punitive damages based on newly discovered information that David Fair, a supervisor and alleged managing agent at the Vons grocery store, consciously disregarded the dangerous condition that caused Plaintiff Mary Ann Tamayo's injuries. The Court has found that the proposed amendment may be viable and has granted the motion, declining to resolve the merits of the claim on a motion for leave. Defendant Vons is free to make merit-based arguments on a demurrer, summary judgment, or the like.
