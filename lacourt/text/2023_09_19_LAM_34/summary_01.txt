And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Motion for Default of Forcible Detainer and Order for Issuance of Writ of Attachment filed by Plaintiff LA Fitness. The Motion is denied due to two procedural reasons. Firstly, the Plaintiff failed to state whether they are suing as an individual or as a registered entity, which is important because corporations cannot represent themselves in propria persona. Secondly, the Plaintiff failed to provide proof of service of the Motion on all defendants, which is required by California Rules of Court and Code of Civil Procedure. The Court cannot consider the Plaintiff's request for relief without proof of service on all defendants, as this would violate the constitutional right of defendants to due process.

**English Summary:**

The judge denied LA Fitness's motion for a default judgment and a writ of attachment against Fitness International LLC, Esporta, City Clubs, and Club One Fitness. The judge cited two procedural reasons for the denial: 

1. **Unclear Legal Status:** LA Fitness did not clearly state whether it's suing as an individual or a registered entity.  This is important because corporations generally can't represent themselves in court.
2. **Lack of Service:** LA Fitness failed to provide proof that it properly served the defendants with the motion, violating their due process rights. 


The case will likely proceed with LA Fitness needing to clarify its legal status and properly serve the defendants with the motion.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, LA Fitness, has filed a motion for default of forcible detainer and order for issuance of a writ of attachment against several defendants. However, the court has denied this motion for two procedural reasons. Firstly, the court is unclear whether LA Fitness is suing as an individual or as a registered entity, as it is a registered entity with multiple corporate entities registered with the California Secretary of State. Secondly, the court is unable to consider the motion because the plaintiff has not served all defendants with the motion, despite the constitutional right of defendants to due process. The court notes that the plaintiff has filed a proof of service of summons and complaint, but it appears to be incomplete. As a result, the motion is denied.

##  English Text Summary:

The judge has denied LA Fitness's motion for a default judgment and writ of attachment against Fitness International LLC, Esporta, City Clubs, and Club One Fitness. 

The judge found two main problems with LA Fitness's request: 

1. **Unclear legal status:** The Complaint doesn't clearly state if LA Fitness is suing as an individual or as a registered business entity. This is important because corporations can't represent themselves in court without a lawyer.
2. **Incomplete service:** LA Fitness hasn't provided proof that all defendants were properly notified about the motion.  

The judge emphasized that defendants have a right to due process, meaning they must be informed of the lawsuit against them and have a chance to respond.  Because of these procedural issues, the judge denied LA Fitness's motion.

### English Summary
The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for default of forcible detainer and order for issuance of writ of attachment. The plaintiff, LA Fitness, filed a handwritten complaint against multiple defendants, including Fitness International LLC and Club One Fitness, seeking $7 trillion in damages for emotional and mental distress. However, the court has identified two procedural issues with the motion.

Secondly, there is no evidence that the plaintiff has served the defendants with the motion, which is a requirement under California law. The court has denied the motion due to these procedural issues, citing the defendants' right to due process and the need for proper service of the motion.
