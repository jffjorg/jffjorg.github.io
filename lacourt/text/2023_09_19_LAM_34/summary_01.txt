And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Motion for Default of Forcible Detainer and Order for Issuance of Writ of Attachment filed by Plaintiff LA Fitness. The Motion is denied due to two procedural reasons. Firstly, the Plaintiff failed to state whether they are suing as an individual or as a registered entity, which is important because corporations cannot represent themselves in propria persona. Secondly, the Plaintiff failed to provide proof of service of the Motion on all defendants, which is required by California Rules of Court and Code of Civil Procedure. The Court cannot consider the Plaintiff's request for relief without proof of service on all defendants, as this would violate the constitutional right of defendants to due process.
