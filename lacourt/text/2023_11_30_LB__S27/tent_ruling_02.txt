1.     Background
Facts
Plaintiff, Delara Toufanpour filed
this action against Defendants, Plantonics, Inc., Jorge Larios, Brian M.
Danaher, and Southern California Equity for breach of contract, breach of the
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraud, breach of fiduciary
duty, rescission of contracts and restation, conversion and misappropriation, and
common counts.  
 
The crux of Plaintiff’s complaint
is that she and three others purchased all shares of Plantonics pursuant to a
Share Purchase Agreement from Defendant Larios on 5/17/21; pursuant to the
agreement, she and non-party Justin Weiner each own 100 shares, non-party Brit
Joshua Parker owns 250 shares, and Defendant Danaher owns 550 shares.  She alleges she paid $200,000 to Larios to
acquire her interest in Plantonics and paid an additional $150,000 to Plantonics
as her share of rents in the property.  
Plaintiff also alleges she entered into
a Stock Pledge Agreement and Promissory Note, pursuant to which she has paid $3333/month
in interest, totaling more than $40,000 to date, accruing on the $1 million
promissory note, which is secured by the stock shares she purchased.  
 
Plaintiff alleges Plantonics’
business is conducting commercial cannabis activity.  She alleges that, because of pending criminal
or other charges made by the City against Larios, Plantonics has been prevented
from commencing or performing the business described in the purchase agreement
or any other revenue-generating activities. 
She alleges Larios represented there was a valid license in place, but
those licenses are not being used due to Larios’s criminal activity.  
 
Plaintiff also alleges she has been
paying $5312 in monthly rent.  
 
She alleges there are inaccuracies
in the purchase agreement, and she alleges Larios and the other defendants are
working together to deprive her of her interest in Plantonics.  
 
2.     2/07/23
Hearing on Demurrer by Defendant Danaher
On 2/07/23, the Court heard Danaher’s
demurrer to the FAC.  The Court issued a
tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend in part and
with leave to amend in part.  The parties
appeared at the hearing, and at the conclusion of the hearing, the Court
adopted its tentative ruling as its final order on the demurrer.  
 
On 3/09/23, Plaintiff filed a
Second Amended Complaint in compliance with the ruling sustaining the demurrer.
The SAC named only one defendant – Jorge Larios.  All claims against Danaher were eliminated
from the SAC.  Notably, on 3/16/23,
Plaintiff filed a request for dismissal of her complaint as to all claims asserted
against Danaher and SoCal Equity Holdings, LLC.
3.     Motion
for Attorneys’ Fees 
On 4/24/23, Danaher filed this
motion for attorneys’ fees, setting it for hearing on 11/30/23.  Any opposition to the motion was due on or
before 11/15/23 in light of the Thanksgiving holiday and CCP §1005(b).  The Court has not received timely opposition
to the motion, and will not consider untimely opposition papers.  
 
The motion was timely filed, as it
was filed within sixty days after Plaintiff dismissed her claims against
Danaher.  See CRC 8.104, 8.108, and
3.1702(b)(1), as well as Sanabria v. Embrey (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th
422, 429.  
 
The motion shows that the parties’
contract includes an attorneys’ fees provision. 
§7.12 of the agreement makes clear that the prevailing party in any
litigation between the parties is entitled to recover attorneys’ fees
incurred.  Thus, pursuant to CCP
§1032(a)(4) and Civil Code §1717, Danaher is entitled to recover his attorneys’
fees incurred in defending against this action. 

 
Danaher seeks to recover fees in
the total amount of $19,052.50.  The
request for fees is based on the Declaration of Counsel, Alexander Conti who
details the efforts that he and co-counsel, Meg Smith, billed Defendant in
connection with this action.  Conti also
attaches detailed billing records as Exhibit D to his declaration.  The Court has reviewed the billing statements
and finds all amounts fair and reasonable, and also finds the requested rates ($300/hour
for Smith and $395/hour for Conti) fair and reasonable.  The motion is granted in full.
 
4.     Case
Management Conference
The parties are reminded that there
is a CMC on calendar concurrently with the hearing on the motion for attorneys’
fees.  The Court asks the parties to make
arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing on the motion and the CMC.
