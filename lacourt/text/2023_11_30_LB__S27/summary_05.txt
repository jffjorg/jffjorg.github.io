This is a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Far West Restaurant Group, LLC, seeking to dismiss the complaint filed by Tattyanna Frescas. The plaintiff alleges that she was assaulted and battered by restaurant employees outside of the restaurant due to a personal relationship with the members of the car with which she had a collision. The demurring defendant argues that the alleged acts were not connected to the employees' duties on the job and therefore the employer is not liable. The Court finds that the demurrer is sustained in its entirety and the complaint is dismissed. The Court also notes that the plaintiff has the burden to show how the complaint can be amended to state a cause of action and that late-filed opposition to the demurrer will not be considered.
