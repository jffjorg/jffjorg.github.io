And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to RFAs (Request for Admissions) filed by the defendant, David Quackenbush. The plaintiff, Duk Ha Kim, filed a lawsuit against the defendant for injuries sustained when he fell off a ladder at the defendant's property.

The judge notes that the plaintiff has taken no steps to have a guardian ad litem (GAL) appointed, despite his condition making it difficult for him to litigate the case on his own. The judge orders the plaintiff to file the necessary application to have a GAL appointed forthwith, and once a GAL is appointed, the parties must meet and confer concerning further responses to the RFAs.

The judge also considers the issue of sanctions and notes that while the plaintiff's responses are technically code-compliant, the lack of a GAL appointed at the outset of litigation has caused delays and difficulties in the case. The judge is inclined to continue the matter to a hearing on January 18, 2024, and requires the parties to file a joint statement of items in dispute at least two weeks prior to the hearing.

The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change based on further submissions from the parties.
