And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents (RPDs) filed by the plaintiffs, Antonio Calderon, Ana Canchola, and Frank G. Martinez, against Southern California Edison Company (SCE). The motion was filed due to SCE's failure to provide complete and straightforward responses to the RPDs. The court finds that SCE's responses were not sufficient and that the motion was made necessary by SCE's refusal to supplement its responses despite agreeing to do so.

The court also grants the plaintiffs' request for sanctions in the amount of $627.66, which represents one hour of their attorney's time plus associated costs. The sanctions are imposed against SCE only and not against its attorney of record.

The court notes that the parties have an additional discovery motion scheduled for February 22, 2024, and asks them to continue to work together in good faith to resolve the issues related to that motion without the need for a hearing.
