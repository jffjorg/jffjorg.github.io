And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment, finding that the plaintiff has raised triable issues of material fact concerning the application of the Good Samaritan defense and breach of standard of care and causation. The plaintiff claims that the defendant, Dr. Askari, was not a Good Samaritan under the applicable law and that his actions caused damage to her child. The judge found that the plaintiff's evidence is sufficient to defeat the Good Samaritan defense, as Dr. Askari was assigned to treat patients in emergency situations like the one the plaintiff experienced. The judge also found that the plaintiff's expert evidence raised triable issues of material fact concerning breach of standard of care and causation. As a result, the motion for summary judgment is denied, and the case will proceed to a hearing.
