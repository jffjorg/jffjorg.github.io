**Tentative Order Granting Motion for Attorneys' Fees**

The Court has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant Brian Danaher's motion for attorneys' fees in the amount of $19,052.50. The motion was filed on April 24, 2023, and the Court did not receive timely opposition to the motion.

The plaintiff, Delara Toufanpour, filed a complaint against multiple defendants, including Brian Danaher, alleging breach of contract and other claims. Danaher filed a demurrer and motion for attorneys' fees, which was heard on February 7, 2023. The Court sustained the demurrer in part and granted leave to amend in part. The plaintiff filed a second amended complaint, which named only one defendant, Jorge Larios, and eliminated all claims against Danaher. The plaintiff also filed a request for dismissal of all claims against Danaher and SoCal Equity Holdings, LLC.

The Court finds that the parties' contract includes an attorneys' fees provision, which entitles the prevailing party to recover attorneys' fees incurred. The Court grants the motion for attorneys' fees, finding that the requested rates ($300/hour for Smith and $395/hour for Conti) are fair and reasonable. The Court also grants the motion in full, ordering Danaher to recover the requested attorneys' fees.
