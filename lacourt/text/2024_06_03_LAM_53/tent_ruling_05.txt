  and         (2) issue new order
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Court, on its own motion        
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Artem Gerashchenkov, as plaintiff in the unlawful detainer case

Order to Show Cause why the court should not (1)
reconsider and vacate (i) its September 29, 2023 order deeming the Unlawful
Detainer Action and Civil Action related, (ii) its September 29, 2023 order
reassigning the Unlawful Detainer Action to Department 53 at the Stanley Mosk
Courthouse, (iii) its September 29, 2023 order consolidating the Unlawful
Detainer Action and Civil Action for all purposes, and (iv) its March 5, 2024
order reclassifying the Unlawful Detainer Action as a civil unlimited case, and
(2) issue a new order (i) finding that the Unlawful Detainer Action and Civil
Action are not related, (ii) denying the request to consolidate the Unlawful
Detainer Action and Civil Action for all purposes, and (iii) leaving the
Unlawful Detainer Action as a limited unlawful detainer case
In Martin-Bragg v. Moore (2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 367, 385, the
Court of Appeal stated:  “[T]he trial
court has the power to consolidate an unlawful detainer proceeding with a
simultaneously pending action in which title to the property is in issue.  That is because a successful claim of title
by the tenant would defeat the landlord’s right to possession. [Citation.] When
an unlawful detainer proceeding and an unlimited action concerning title to the
property are simultaneously pending, the trial court in which the unlimited
action is pending may stay the unlawful detainer action until the issue of
title is resolved in the unlimited action, or it may consolidate the actions.
[Citation.]”  Thus, the Court of Appeal
concluded that “the trial court abused its discretion in refusing [the unlawful
detainer defendant’s] request to consolidate the unlawful detainer and quiet
title actions for trial and that [the unlawful detainer defendant] was
prejudiced by being forced to litigate the complex issue of title to the property
under the summary procedures that govern actions for unlawful detainer.”  (Id. at pp. 370-371.)     
Here, following the ruling in Martin-Bragg, the court, on
September 29, 2023, issued an order granting the ex parte application filed by
plaintiff Aysia A. Rowe (“Rowe”) and ordering that (1) this unlimited civil
action filed by Rowe (Case No. 23STCV14562) (the “Civil Action”) and the
limited civil action for unlawful detainer filed by defendant Artem
Gerashchenkov (“Gerashchenkov”) (Case No. 23IWUD01124) (the “Unlawful Detainer
Action”) are related cases, (2) the Unlawful Detainer Action shall be assigned
to Department 53, and (3) the Civil Action and the Unlawful Detainer Action are
consolidated for all purposes.  (Sep. 29,
2023 Minute Order, p. 1.)  On March 5,
2024, the court issued an order reclassifying the Unlawful Detainer Action
(which was filed as a limited jurisdiction civil case) as an unlimited civil
case.  (Mar. 25, 2024 Minute Order, p.
1.)   
On May 9, 2024, based on new facts and circumstances, the court
exercised its discretion to set an Order to Show Cause why the court should not
(1) reconsider and vacate (i) its September 29, 2023 order deeming the Unlawful
Detainer Action and Civil Action related, (ii) its September 29, 2023 order
reassigning the Unlawful Detainer Action to Department 53 at the Stanley Mosk
Courthouse, (iii) its September 29, 2023 order consolidating the Unlawful
Detainer Action and Civil Action for all purposes, and (iv) its March 5, 2024
order reclassifying the Unlawful Detainer Action as a civil unlimited case, and
(2) issue a new order (i) finding that the Unlawful Detainer Action and Civil
Action are not related, (ii) denying the request to consolidate the Unlawful
Detainer Action and Civil Action for all purposes, and (iii) leaving the
Unlawful Detainer Action as a limited unlawful detainer case.  (May 9, 2024 Order, p. 3:16-25.)  The court further ordered that any response
to the Order to Show Cause shall be filed no later than nine court days before
the hearing.  (May 9, 2024 Order, p. 3:26-27.)  Finally, the court ordered Gerashchenkov to
give notice of the court’s May 9, 2024 order.  (May 9, 2024 Order, p. 4:1.)
On May 16, 2024, Gerashchenkov filed a “Notice of Ruling” with the
court, summarizing the court’s ruling and attaching a copy of the court’s May
9, 2024 order.  (May 16, 2024 Notice of
Ruling, p. 2 and Ex. A.)  Attached to
Gerashchenkov’s Notice of Ruling is a proof of service stating that the Notice
of Ruling was served, by electronic service, on “Attorneys for Defendant” Mike
Chappars.  (May 16, 2024 Notice of
Ruling, pp. 3-5 [internal italics omitted].) This proof of service, however,
does not state that Gerashchenkov served the Notice of Ruling on Rowe.  (Ibid.)  Moreover, Rowe did not file a response to the
court’s Order to Show Cause. 
Thus, it appears that Rowe was not served with the court’s May 9, 2024
order and therefore may not have been given proper notice of the court’s Order
to Show Cause.
The court therefore finds that it is appropriate, and exercises its
discretion, to continue the hearing on the court’s Order to Show Cause so that
(1) Rowe has an opportunity to file a response to the Order to Show Cause, and
(2) the court has an opportunity to consider any such response filed by Rowe.
ORDER
The court orders that the hearing on the court’s Order to Show Cause
why the court should not (1) reconsider and vacate (i) its September 29, 2023
order deeming the Unlawful Detainer Action and Civil Action related, (ii) its
September 29, 2023 order reassigning the Unlawful Detainer Action to Department
53 at the Stanley Mosk Courthouse, (iii) its September 29, 2023 order
consolidating the Unlawful Detainer Action and Civil Action for all purposes,
and (iv) its March 5, 2024 order reclassifying the Unlawful Detainer Action as
a civil unlimited case, and (2) issue a new order (i) finding that the Unlawful
Detainer Action and Civil Action are not related, (ii) denying the request to
consolidate the Unlawful Detainer Action and Civil Action for all purposes, and
(iii) leaving the Unlawful Detainer Action as a limited unlawful detainer case.
is continued from June 3, 2024, to June 17, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., in Department
53.
The court orders that any response to the Order to Show Cause shall be
filed and served at least three court days before the hearing. 
The court orders Artem
Gerashchenkov (1) to give notice of this ruling, and (2) to file with the court,
no later than June 7, 2024, a notice of ruling and proof of service with the
court establishing that Artem Gerashchenkov has served all parties with the
notice of ruling. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  June 3, 2024
