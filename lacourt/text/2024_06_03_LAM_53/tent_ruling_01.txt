MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Eric Jones     
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Herbert Hayden, of Harris & Hayden, counsel for defendant
Los Angeles Unified School District 
Motion for Sanctions
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
The court grants plaintiff
Eric Jones’s request for judicial notice. 
(Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (d); People v. Hinkley (1987) 193
Cal.App.3d 383, 386, n. 2 [taking judicial notice of the decision and findings
of the State Bar Court].) 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Eric Jones (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order (1) sanctioning
Herbert Hayden, Esq., and Harris & Hayden (“Counsel”), counsel for
defendant Los Angeles Unified School District (“Defendant”) in the amount of
$13,693.05; (2) awarding Plaintiff attorney’s fees and costs in the amount of
$11,993.05; (3) directing Counsel to pay Plaintiff $700 so that Plaintiff may
pay Howard Twomey’s invoice; and (4) imposing a $1,000 sanction pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.050, and directing Counsel to report any
such sanction to the State Bar.  Plaintiff
moves for this relief on the ground that Counsel made misrepresentations in
Defendant’s expert witness declaration under penalty of perjury.
A “court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in
the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or
both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone
as a result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).)  “A trial
court may impose sanctions, however, only ‘[t]o the extent authorized by the
chapter governing any particular discovery method or any other provisions of
this title.’  ([Code Civ. Proc.,] §
2023.030.)  ‘This means that the statutes
governing the particular discovery methods limit the permissible sanctions to
those sanctions provided under the applicable governing statutes.’”  (Moofly Productions, LLC v. Favila (2020)
46 Cal.App.5th 1, 10-11, quoting New Albertsons, Inc. v. Superior Court (2008)
168 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1422.)  Thus, “sections
2023.010 and 2023.030 do not independently authorize the trial court to impose
monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery.”  (City of Los Angeles v.
PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 504, review granted
January 25, 2023, S277211; Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030.)
First, the court denies Plaintiff’s requests for monetary sanctions
and attorney’s fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030.  
Plaintiff did not cite statutory authority that would permit the court
to impose sanctions against Counsel pursuant to section 2023.030.  As set forth above, the court may impose
sanctions only “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter governing any
particular discovery method or any other provision of this title.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030; Moofly, supra,
46 Cal.App.5th at pp. 10-11.)  Although
Plaintiff cited, generally, the requirements of section 2034.260, that statute
does not provide for the imposition of sanctions.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2034.260.)  Plaintiff did not cite any other provision authorizing
sanctions set forth in the statutes governing expert witness exchanges.[1]
 Plaintiff also did not cite authority
establishing that the court has authority to direct Defendant (and/or Counsel)
to pay the increased deposition fees sought by Twomey. 
Moreover, based on the evidence and arguments presented in the moving,
opposition, and reply papers, the court finds that Plaintiff has not met his
burden to establish that Counsel has engaged in conduct that violates Business
and Professions Code section 6106. 
Thus, the court finds that Plaintiff has not met his burden to show
that the court should (1) impose monetary sanctions against Counsel, (2) award
Plaintiff attorney’s fees, and (3) direct Counsel to pay Twomey’s $700 invoice.

The court notes that, although it is denying Plaintiff’s motion and is
not issuing a ruling on the requested relief regarding Twomey’s $700 invoice since
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 do not authorize the
court to impose sanctions based on the alleged conduct, the court would expect
that Twomey will be compensated for his time testifying at deposition based on
the statement of his hourly fee for providing deposition testimony as stated in
Defendant’s expert witness declaration pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2034.260, subdivision (c)(5).
Second, the court denies Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions in
the amount of $1,000 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.050.
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.050, the “court shall
impose a one-thousand-dollar ($1,000) sanction . . . if, upon reviewing a
request for a sanction made pursuant to Section 2023.040, the court finds” that
the party, person, or attorney (1) did not respond in good faith to a request
for the production of documents or an inspection demand, (2) produced requested
documents within seven days before the court was scheduled to hear a motion to
compel production of records that was filed by the requesting party as a result
of the other party’s, person’s, or attorney’s failure to respond in good faith,
or (3) failed to confer with the party or attorney requesting documents in a
reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve informally any dispute concerning
the request.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.050, subd. (a).)  Plaintiff has not
shown that Defendant or Counsel engaged in the conduct described above.  
Thus, the court finds that Plaintiff has not met his burden to show
that the court should impose monetary sanctions against Counsel in the amount
of $1,000 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.050.
ORDER
            The court denies plaintiff Eric
Jones’s motion for sanctions.
            The court orders defendant Los
Angeles Unified School District to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
