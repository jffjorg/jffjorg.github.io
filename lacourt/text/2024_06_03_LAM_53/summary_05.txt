The tentative ruling is about the court's order to show cause why it should not reconsider and vacate its previous orders related to the consolidation of cases and reclassification of a civil unlimited case. The case involves an unlawful detainer action and a civil unlimited case, which the court consolidated in September 2023. However, on May 9, 2024, the court issued an order to show cause why it should not reconsider and vacate its previous orders. The court finds that it is appropriate to continue the hearing to allow the plaintiff, Aysia A. Rowe, to file a response to the order to show cause. The court also orders that the defendant, Artem Gerashchenkov, provide notice of the court's ruling and file a proof of service with the court. The hearing is continued to June 17, 2024.
