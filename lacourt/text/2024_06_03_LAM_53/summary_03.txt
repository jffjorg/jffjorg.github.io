And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has decided to continue the hearing on the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories, set twelve, to August 2, 2024. The court has also ordered that the plaintiff give notice of this ruling. The court's decision comes after considering the parties' motions and oppositions. The defendant had filed a motion for a protective order seeking to avoid responding to certain discovery propounded by the plaintiff. The court has decided to continue the hearing on the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses in order to consider both the defendant's motion for a protective order and the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses, as they appear to concern the same set of discovery.
