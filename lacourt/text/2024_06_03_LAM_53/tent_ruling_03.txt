  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion to compel further
  responses to special interrogatories, set twelve
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D.,
Inc.
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant Yang Lu
Motion to Compel Further Responses to
Special Interrogatories, Set Twelve
The court considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in
connection with this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D., Inc. (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an
order (1) compelling defendant Yang Lu (“Defendant”) to serve further responses
to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories, Set Twelve, numbers 143-153, and (2)
awarding sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of
$5,346.65.
The court notes that, on December 20, 2023, Defendant filed a motion
for a protective order seeking an order that Defendant need not respond to
certain discovery propounded by Plaintiff. 
(Def. Mot. for Protective Order filed Dec. 20, 2023, p. 9:18-21.)  The motion appears to concern, at least in
part, Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories, numbers 143-153.  (Id., p. 7:13-21 [noting that
Plaintiff served “153 special interrogatories” and contending that Plaintiff is
using interrogatories to harass Defendant].) 
The court advanced the hearing on Defendant’s motion to June 28,
2024.  (April 26, 2024 Minute Order, p.
1.)
Because
Defendant’s motion for a protective order and Plaintiff’s motion to compel
further responses appear to concern the same set of discovery, the court finds
that it is appropriate, and exercises its discretion, to continue the hearing
on Plaintiff’s pending motion to compel Defendant’s further responses to
special interrogatories so that it may be heard after the court rules on
Defendant’s motion for a protective order.  
ORDER
            The court orders that the hearing on
plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D., Inc.’s motion to compel further responses to
special interrogatories, set twelve, is continued to August 2, 2024, at 10:00
a.m., in Department 53. 
            The court orders plaintiff Seran Ng,
D.M.D., Inc.to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  June 3, 2024
