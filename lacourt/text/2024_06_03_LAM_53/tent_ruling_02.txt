The court notes that Plaintiff has also filed this motion pursuant to Rules of
Professional Conduct, rule 8.3, based on Plaintiff’s counsel’s concern that he
may be liable for not reporting this conduct to the State Bar or the
court.  (Irmas Decl., ¶ 33.)  This rule, however, does not permit the court
to impose monetary sanctions against Counsel.
