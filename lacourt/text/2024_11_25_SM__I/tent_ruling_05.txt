 Case Number:  23SMCV02264    Hearing Date:   November 25, 2024    Dept:  I This is a motion for terminating sanctions.  The court had been prepared to grant the
motion, but on Friday, plaintiff submitted responses.  The court has not seen those responses, but
if they comply with the court’s prior order, then terminating sanctions seem
excessive.  That said, if they do not
comply, the court anticipates that the defense will (after appropriate meet and
confer assuming these responses are in good faith) bring another motion, and
this time for sanctions other than monetary, and perhaps terminating sanctions
again.  Defendants have requested monetary
sanctions.  That request is GRANTED in
the amount prayed of $1209.50, payable within 30 days.  The sanctions are imposed against plaintiff,
but not counsel.  The court will also
inquire of plaintiff as to why it has taken until now for plaintiff to respond
to the discovery and to obey the court’s order. 
The court warns plaintiff that the responses just served must not have
been in bad faith.  That means that they
should comply with the court’s prior orders and should not be dissembling or
full of non-responses or objections.
 
The court is more than a little bit disappointed at
plaintiff and counsel.  Should this
continue, plaintiff can rest assured that the court has plenty of tools in its
toolbox to deal with the situation appropriately.
