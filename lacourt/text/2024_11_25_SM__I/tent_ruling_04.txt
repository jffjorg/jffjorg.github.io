 Case Number:  23SMCV00366    Hearing Date:   November 25, 2024    Dept:  I The matter is here for a final status conference.  However, the court has received a notice of
settlement.  Because this case is a PAGA
case, court approval of the settlement is required.  The settlement has been lodged with the
court.  The court has reviewed the
settlement and has the following thoughts. 
The court is inclined to APPROVE the settlement, but that assumes it is
reading certain things correctly.  As the
court understands it, plaintiff’s counsel is not seeking a fee and plaintiff is
not seeking a special payment.  The
employees who would recover under the settlement are waiving their right to
bring a PAGA action, but are not waiving their right to sue for any underlying
violations and to seek damages in their own right, except for the named
plaintiff.  The named plaintiff has no
other action against the defendant that is being or has been settled related to
employment issues.  Assuming that all of
that is true, the court will APPROVE the settlement.  However, the court does note that the
administrative costs are almost as much as the employees are receiving.  That is unfortunate, but the court cannot think
of any other way to do it.  The court
will require a stand alone order.
