And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for a protective order brought by the defense, which seeks to restrict the plaintiff's communication style to a civil tone. The judge has reviewed the plaintiff's submissions and finds that they have included profanity and personal attacks on counsel, which is not permitted. The judge notes that while the plaintiff is self-represented, she still must follow the rules of court and communicate professionally.

The judge grants the request for a protective order, requiring all written communications between the defense and plaintiff to be civil in tone. The judge also denies the request for monetary sanctions, but warns that if the plaintiff continues to use inappropriate language, sanctions will be imposed.

The judge reminds the parties that the final status conference is set for December 23, 2024, and the trial is set for December 30, 2024. The parties are expected to comply with the court's orders and work together to ensure a timely resolution of the case.

Finally, the judge notes that the plaintiff's request to prohibit all communications between the defense and plaintiff unless the defense provides a settlement check is frivolous and in bad faith. The court will not entertain such requests and expects the parties to work towards a resolution through settlement or trial.
