And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling addresses the lack of preparation from the defendant in a Song-Beverly matter, which was originally set for trial in October but was moved to November 25, 2024, due to the court's schedule. The plaintiff submitted FSC materials, including a witness list, jury questions, exhibit list, short statement of the case, and special verdict form, but the defendant did not. The court intends to inquire about the defendant's lack of preparation and may deem the matter not ready for trial and vacate the trial date if the reasons are not satisfactory. The court may also consider barring the defendant from calling witnesses or introducing evidence, or deeming the defendant to have waived any objection to the exhibits submitted by the plaintiff.
