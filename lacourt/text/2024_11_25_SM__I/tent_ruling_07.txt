 Case Number:  24SMCV02939    Hearing Date:   November 25, 2024    Dept:  I The unopposed motion to compel arbitration and stay the
action is GRANTED.  Defendant has
established that there is an arbitration clause in the operative contract
(actually, two of them) and there is  no
showing of unconscionability or the like. 
Accordingly, the court GRANTS the motion to compel arbitration, STAYS
the action pending the completion of the arbitration, and will SET A STATUS
CONFERENCE for about 9 months from now to make sure that the arbitration is
moving forward properly.
