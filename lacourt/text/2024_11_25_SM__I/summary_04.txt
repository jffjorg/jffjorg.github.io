And here is the summary in English text:

The court has reviewed the settlement proposal and is inclined to approve it, pending certain conditions being met. The settlement would require court approval due to the case being a PAGA (Private Attorney General Act) case. The court understands that the plaintiff's counsel is not seeking a fee, the plaintiff is not seeking a special payment, and the employees who would benefit from the settlement are waiving their right to bring a PAGA action, but not waiving their right to sue for underlying violations and seek damages in their own right, except for the named plaintiff. The named plaintiff has no other action against the defendant related to employment issues. Assuming all of this is true, the court will approve the settlement. However, the court notes that the administrative costs are almost as high as the amount received by the employees, which is unfortunate, but the court cannot think of a better way to do it. The court will require a standalone order to finalize the settlement.
