And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the readiness of the case for trial at the upcoming Final Status Conference (FSC) on November 25, 2024. The court has received documents from the defendant, including a witness list, jury instructions, exhibit list, and special verdict, but the plaintiff's documents have not been jointly submitted. The judge notes that the parties have failed to meet and confer as ordered, and that the court has not received required documents such as jury instructions from the plaintiff, trial briefs, and an updated estimate of total trial time. The court will inquire about the jointness of the submitted documents and will not proceed with trial if they are not joint. If the documents are joint, the court will inquire about the timing of jury instructions and exhibit conferencing. The judge also notes that the trial date may need to be re-set due to the court's current trial schedule, and that sanctions may be imposed if the parties fail to complete the required work.
