And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a request to set an order to show cause (OSC) regarding sanctions due to the parties' failure to follow the court's orders regarding the prior FSC. The court was disappointed with the parties' lack of responsibility and failure to complete the work, with many counsel blaming each other for the problem. However, in their supplemental declarations, all parties now accept responsibility for the failure and explain the circumstances surrounding the issue. The court believes that the purpose of the OSC has been accomplished, and that the parties now understand the importance of working together to get the case ready for trial in a timely manner. Therefore, the court declines to impose sanctions, finding that they would serve no valid purpose and would only be a form of punishment. The OSC is discharged.
