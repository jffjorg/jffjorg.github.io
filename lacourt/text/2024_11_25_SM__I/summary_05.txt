And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for terminating sanctions. Although initially prepared to grant the motion, the judge has not seen the plaintiff's responses submitted on Friday, but if they comply with the court's prior order, terminating sanctions might be excessive. However, if the responses do not comply, the judge anticipates that the defense will bring another motion for sanctions, possibly terminating sanctions again. The judge grants the defense's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $1209.50, payable within 30 days. The sanctions are imposed on the plaintiff but not the counsel. The judge warns the plaintiff that the responses must be in good faith and comply with the court's prior orders, and expresses disappointment with the plaintiff and counsel.
