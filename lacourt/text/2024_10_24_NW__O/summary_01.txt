And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the defendants' motion to strike the plaintiffs' complaint. The defendants argued that the filing of an unlawful detainer action (UD Action) was protected activity under California Code of Civil Procedure ยง 425.16, and that the plaintiffs' causes of action were based on this protected activity. However, the Judge found that the plaintiffs' causes of action were not based on the UD Action, but rather on the defendants' alleged breach of promise to convey title to the property. The Judge concluded that the defendants did not meet their burden of showing that the causes of action arose from protected activity, and therefore denied the motion to strike.
