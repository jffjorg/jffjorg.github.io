ORDER
  DENYING DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO STRIKE PURSUANT TO CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE §
  425.16
 
 



 
I.        INTRODUCTION
          This
case arises out of Defendants Nathaly Whiting’s (“Whiting”) and Claudia Cortez’s
(“Cortez”)(collectively, “Defendants”) alleged promise to convey title of a
home located at 5460 White Oak Avenue, Unit G220, Encino, CA 91316 (“Property”)
to Plaintiffs Roberto Luis Arevalo and Santos Gloria Arevalo (collectively,
“Plaintiffs”). Plaintiffs allege Cortez’s daughter Whiting agreed to purchase
the Property on behalf of Plaintiffs to make up for Cortez’s failure to prevent
the foreclosure of a separate property owned by Plaintiffs. (See Complaint,
¶¶ 7-10.) As part of the agreement, Plaintiffs allegedly promised to pay the
down payment, mortgage, and homeowner’s fess of the Property while Whiting
promised to transfer the Property’s title to Plaintiffs within a reasonable
amount of time after purchase. (See Complaint, ¶ 10.) Plaintiffs further
allege Whiting did not transfer title to Plaintiffs after purchasing the
Property on November 2, 2021, and, as a result, Plaintiffs stopped paying the
Property’s mortgage and fees. (See Complaint, ¶¶ 11, 13.) 
          On
May 21, 2024, Plaintiffs allege Whiting initiated an unlawful detainer action
(“UD Action”) against Plaintiffs. (See Complaint, ¶ 14.) 
          Plaintiffs
then filed the instant action against Defendants on July 19, 2024. 
          Defendants
now seeks to strike Plaintiffs’ Complaint pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §
425.16.[1] 
II.      PROCEDURAL
HISTORY
On July 19,
2024, Plaintiffs filed their Complaint, alleging (1) Promissory Estoppel; (2)
Fraud; (3) Quiet Title; (4) Imposition of Constructive Trust; (5) Breach of Quasi-Contract
and for Restitution and Unjust Enrichment; (6) Breach of Fiduciary Duty; and
(7) Negligence. 
On August 5,
2024, this Court denied Plaintiffs’ Ex Parte Application to consolidate the UD
Action but granted Plaintiffs’ Request to Stay the UD Action pending the
resolution of this action provided Plaintiffs post an undertaking. 
On August 16,
2024, Plaintiffs filed Notice of Issuance of Bond. 
On September
25, 2024, Defendants filed the instant Motion to Strike Pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure § 425.16 (“Motion”).
          On October 1, 2024, Plaintiffs
filed their Opposition. 
On October
17, 2024, Defendants filed their Reply. 
III.     LEGAL
STANDARD
“A cause of action against a person arising
from any act of that person in furtherance of the person’s right of petition or
free speech under the United States Constitution or the California Constitution
in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to
strike [“anti-SLAAP motion”], unless the court determines that the plaintiff
has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on
the claim.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 425.16(b)(1); see also Church of Scientology
v. Wollersheim (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 628, 644-645 (observing the legislature
enacted Code Civ. Proc. § 425.16 to protect citizens exercising constitutional
rights of petition and free speech from meritless lawsuits) (overruled in other
part by Equilon Enters. v. Consumer Cause, Inc. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 53,
68, fn. 5.)[2]
The trial court applies a burden
shifting analysis when considering a special motion to strike brought under
section 425.16. (See Soukup v. Law Offices of Herbert Hafif (2006) 39
Cal.4th 260, 278.) First, the defense must carry its burden of making a
threshold showing that a challenged cause of action arises from “any act of
that person in furtherance of the person's right of petition or free speech
under the [federal or state constitution] with a public issue.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 425.16(b)(1); see also Soukup, 39 Cal.4th at 278.) Acts which
are protected under section 425.16 include “any written or oral statement or
writing made before a … judicial proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 425.16(e)(1); see
also Briggs v. Eden Council for Hope & Opportunity (1999) 19 Cal.4th
1106, 1116 (anti-SLAPP statute protects all petition-related activity before a
governmental body, whether the statements involve a public issue or not). Second,
only after the defendant has met its initial burden does the burden shift to
the plaintiff to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on the merits of the
pleading or on part of the pleading at issue. (See Equilon, 29 Cal.4th
at 67.)   
A plaintiff opposing a special motion
to strike has the burden to “state[] and substantiate[] a legally sufficient
claim.” (Navellier v. Sletten (2002) 29 Cal.4th 82, 88, 93.) “Put
another way, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally
sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to
sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is
credited.” (Navellier, 20 Cal.4th at 88–89 (cleaned up).) To that
end, the plaintiff must present competent evidence, “that would be admissible
at trial.” (HMS Capital, Inc. v. Lawyers Title Co. (2004) 118
Cal.App.4th 204, 212.) “[D]eclarations may not be based upon ‘information and
belief’” and documents submitted without the proper foundation will not be
considered. (Id. (citation omitted).) The complaint, even if
verified, is insufficient to carry the plaintiff's shifted burden. (See Roberts
v. Los Angeles County Bar Assn. (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 604, 614; see also
Karnazes v. Ares (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 344, 354 (stating “pleadings do not
constitute evidence”).)
IV.     ANALYSIS
A.            
Defendants Do Not Meet Their Burden as to the First Prong.
“A cause of action is
subject to a special motion to strike if the defendant shows that the cause of
action arises from an act in furtherance of the Defendants’ constitutional
right of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue and the
plaintiff fails to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on the claim.” (Digerati
Holdings, LLC v. Young Money Entertainment, LLC (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 873,
883 (citations omitted).)  
“An ‘act in furtherance
of a person’s right of petition or free speech under the United States or
California Constitution in connection with a public issue’ is defined by
statute to include ‘(1) any written or oral statement or writing made before a
legislative, executive, or judicial proceeding, or any other official
proceeding authorized by law, (2) any written or oral statement or writing made
in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,
executive, or judicial body, or any other official proceeding authorized by law,
(3) any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public
or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest, or (4) any
other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of
petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public
issue or an issue of public interest.’ … If the defendant shows that the
cause of action arises from a statement described in clause (1) or (2) of
section 425.16, subdivision (e), the defendant is not required to separately
demonstrate that the statement was made in connection with a ‘public issue.’” (Id.
(citations omitted).) 
Defendants seek to
strike portions of Plaintiffs’ Complaint pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §
425.16(e)(1). (See Motion, p. 5.) Specifically, Defendants seek to
strike the portions of Plaintiffs’ causes of action and prayer for relief which
reference the UD Action, as Defendants argue the filing of the UD Action constitutes
protected activity. (See id.)[3] “Not
only is the filing of the UD Action protected, but the statements made within
the UD Action are also protected activities.” (Id. at 6.) 
In opposition,
Plaintiffs argue their references to the UD Action in their Complaint merely serve
as evidence related to liability and do not form the basis on which liability
is based. (See Opposition, pp. 7-8 (“…the actions that form the basis of
Plaintiffs’ complaint do not arise out of a constitutional right to petition or
free speech in connection with a public issue…[t]he action does not arise out
of the filing by Defendants of an unlawful detainer action.”) 
In reply, Defendants dispute
Plaintiffs’ argument in opposition and argue Plaintiffs’ causes of action are
supported by Plaintiffs’ references to the UD Action. (See Reply, pp.
3-4.) Of note, Defendants argue, is Plaintiffs’ incorporation by reference of Paragraphs
1-15, and in particular Paragraphs 14 and 15 [under the heading “Allegations
Common to All Causes of Action”], in each of the causes of action at issue. (See
Reply, pg. 4.)[4]
Defendants argue Plaintiffs’ incorporation of Paragraphs 14 and 15 into each
cause of action demonstrates the UD Action allegations provide the basis for each
cause of action and thus each cause of action is based on protected conduct. (See
Reply, pp. 4-6.)
As an initial matter,
the Court agrees with Defendants that the filing of a lawsuit in an underlying
unlawful detainer action is generally considered protected petitioning activity
and that, as such, the portions of Plaintiffs’ Complaint Defendants seek to
strike would be considered protected activity. (See Aron v. WIB Holdings
(2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 1069, 1083; see Feldman v. 1100 Park Lane Associates
(2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 1467, 1480.) The Court also agrees Defendants may seek
to strike those portions of a complaint which describe protected activity. (Baral
v. Schnitt (2016) 1 Cal.5th 376, 395-396.) 
The critical
consideration, however, “is whether the cause of action is based on the
defendant's protected free speech or petitioning activity.” (Navellier,
29 Cal.4th at 89.) Allegations of “protected activity that merely provide
context, without supporting a claim for recovery, cannot be stricken under the
anti-SLAPP statute.” (Baral, 1 Cal. 5th at 394.) “The only means
specified in section 425.16 by which a moving defendant can satisfy the
[‘arising from’] requirement is to demonstrate that the defendant's conduct by
which plaintiff claims to have been injured falls within one of the four
categories described in subdivision (e)....In short, in ruling on an anti-SLAPP
motion, courts should consider the elements of the challenged claim and what actions
by the defendant supply those elements and consequently form the basis for
liability.” (Park v. Board of Trustees of Cal. State Univ. (2017) 2
Cal.5th 1057, 1063 (citations omitted).) 
Despite Defendants’
arguments to the contrary, the Court does not find Plaintiffs’ causes of action
rest on Plaintiffs’ references to the UD Action. Plaintiffs’ Complaint is
largely focused on Whiting’s breach of her promise to convey title, a
breach Plaintiffs allegedly learned about prior to the filing of the UD Action,
an action based on possession. (See Complaint; Declaration of
Nathaly Whiting filed September 25, 2024, ¶ 5, Ex. A.) Paragraph 13 states “[i]n
or about later in the year 2024, the Plaintiffs learned that the Encino
Property had not been placed in their name, and that Defendant Whiting had no
intention of conveying the property to them. Frustrated with this
development, Plaintiffs no longer believed that the payments they were making
to cover the mortgage payments and the association dues were appropriate, and,
therefore, those payments stopped.” (Complaint, ¶ 13 (emphasis added).) It is
after Paragraph 13, and after Plaintiffs allegedly learned of Whiting’s intent
to retain title to the Property, that Plaintiffs mention the UD Action and the
fact that “the threat of eviction is in direct contradiction with Defendants’
promises that the Plaintiffs would have permanent and exclusive possession of
the [Property].” (Complaint, ¶ 15.) 
Plaintiffs’ first
(promissory estoppel), second (fraud), third (quiet title), and fifth (breach
of quasi-contract) causes of action rest on the alleged failure to convey title,
not the filing of the UD Action/Whiting’s attempt to regain possession of the
Property. (See Complaint, ¶¶ 16-41.) Plaintiffs’ sixth cause of action
(breach of fiduciary duty) is not even related to the Property and is alleged
only against Cortez and her failure to prevent the foreclosure of a separate
property owned by Plaintiffs. (See Complaint, ¶¶ 51-55.) In sum, Plaintiffs’
references to the UD Action, though incorporated into each cause of action, do
not supply the elements of those causes of action but provide context only. Defendants
have thus failed to meet their burden of making a threshold showing that the
challenged causes of action arise
from “any act of that person in furtherance of the person's right of petition
or free speech under the [federal or state constitution] with a public issue.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 425.16(b)(1).)
Accordingly, the
Court DENIES Defendants’ Motion.
IV.     CONCLUSION
Based on
the foregoing, the Court DENIES Defendants’ Motion to Strike Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. §
425.16.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
DATED:      October 24, 2024
