[2] SLAPP is an acronym for
“strategic lawsuit against public participation.” (Equilon Enterprises, 29
Cal.4th at 57.) For clarity, we also refer to an “anti-SLAPP” motion as “a
special motion to strike”—the language used in the statute (Code Civ. Proc. §
425.16(b)(1)).
 


[3] The Court will not
further address Defendants’ Motion as it pertains to Paragraph 7 of Plaintiffs’
prayer for relief as it does not find Paragraph 7 is a “cause of action”
subject to being stricken. (See Code Civ. Proc. 425.16(b)(1); see
also Baral v. Schnitt (2016) 1 Cal.5th 376, 381–382.)
 


[4] Paragraph 14 states
“[i]n response, on or about May 21, 2024, Defendant Whiting, with the knowledge
and participation of Defendant Cortez, filed an unlawful detainer lawsuit, Case
Number, 24VEUD01733. In that unlawful detainer lawsuit, Defendant Whiting seeks
to evict the Plaintiffs from their residence. In the unlawful detainer lawsuit,
Defendant Whiting has falsely alleged that an ‘oral’ rental agreement existed
between the Plaintiffs and her.” (Complaint, ¶ 14.) The relevant portion of
Paragraph 15 states “…and Defendant Whiting has requested that the Court schedule
a trial date so that an eviction can be ordered and that the Plaintiffs would
then be evicted from their own home. The threat of eviction is in direct
contradiction with Defendants’ promises that the Plaintiffs would have
permanent and exclusive possession of the Encino Property.” (Complaint, ¶ 15.)
