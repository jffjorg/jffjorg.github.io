for Breach of Guaranty against Jane Un (Defendant) and Does 1-10.
            The
Court issued its finding for Plaintiff on January 03, 2024.
            On
November 14, 2023, Plaintiff filed its Motion for Attorney’s Fees.
            On

LEGAL STANDARD
¿¿            The
California Code of Civil Procedure provides for attorney’s fees to the
prevailing party in a contract action only if the contract included an
attorney’s fees provision.  (Cal. Civ.
Proc. § 1717.)  The “prevailing party” is
the party who obtained grater relief in the action.  (Cal. Civ. Proc. § 1717(b)(1).)
            A
plaintiff’s verified billing invoices are prima facie evidence that the costs,
expenses, and services listed were necessarily incurred.  (See Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167
Cal.App.3d 677, 682.)  Counsel has the
burden of providing the reasonable number of hours devoted to the litigation,
through declarations, or redacted or unredacted timesheets or billing
records.  (Concepcion v. Amscan
Holdings, Inc. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 1309, 1325.)  “[T]he verified time statements of the
attorneys, as officers of the court, are entitled to credence in the absence of
a clear indication the records are erroneous.” (Horsford v. Board of
Trustees of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 396.)  
“‘In
challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many hours of work are
claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point to the specific
items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to the evidence.
General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do
not suffice.’”  (Lunada Biomedical v.
Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 488. Accord Etcheson v. FCA US LLC
(2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 831, 848.)
The
determination of reasonable amount of attorney fees is within the sound
discretion of trial courts.  (PLCM
Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.)
“[A]ttorney
fees need not be reduced for work on unsuccessful claims if the claims ‘are so
intertwined that it would be impracticable, if not impossible, to separate the
attorney's time into compensable and noncompensable units.’"  (Mann v. Quality Old Time Service, Inc.
(2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 328, 342.) 
Costs
are recoverable if they are reasonably necessary to the litigation and are
reasonable in amount.  (See Thon v.
Thompson (1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1546, 1548.) 
If
items appear on their face to be proper, the verified memorandum of costs is
prima facie evidence of their propriety, shifting the burden of proof to the
attacking party.  (Adams v. Ford Motor
Co. (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 1475, 1486-1487.)   “[T]he
burden is on the objecting party to show them to be unnecessary or
unreasonable.”  (Nelson v. Anderson
(1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 131.)  
 
 
 
DISCUSSION  
            Two
contracts were at issue in the matter, a loan agreement between Plaintiff and
MJM Ventures and Guarantee Agreements between Jane Un and Linkage.  These contracts provide for reasonable
attorney’s fees and costs.  Plaintiff was
the prevailing party in the matter and, therefore, Plaintiff is entitled to
attorney’s fees. 
 
1)     
Attorney’s
Fees
Plaintiff
submitted a Declaration from Paul Johnson supporting the hourly rate and costs
associated with this case.  Additionally,
Plaintiff submitted a reasonably redacted billing record.  (Concepcion, supra, 223
Cal.App.4th at 1325.)  Given that
Plaintiff has submitted a billing record, the burden shifts to Defendant to
challenge the sufficiency of the billing statements.  (Lunada Biomedical, supra, 230
Cal.App.4th at 342.)
Defendant
alleges three primary insufficiencies of the billing statements (1) the billing
statement is redacted; (2) blocked billing; (3) complexity.  The central component to the Defendant’s
objections is that the billing records are redacted and block billed in a way
that makes it impossible to distinguish between different causes of action for
the purpose of awarding attorney’s fees. 
Defendant
challenges that Plaintiff did not prevail on some matters, including the 18%
interest rate and the recovery of collection costs.  In cases where a party succeeds on some
claims, but fails on other distinct claims, the Court must be able to
differentiate between the attorney work for the separate claims.  (See Hensley, supra, 461 U.S.
at 440.)  In this case, Plaintiff was
successful on the merits of the claims, the Court’s finding for only a 12%
interest rate and the denial of collection costs are not factually distinct
from Plaintiff’s overall success. 
Therefore, the billing statement does not need to be so specific as to
differentiate for work done on each issue or cause of action for the Court to
assess reasonableness. 
Defendant’s
objections to redactions and alleged block billing are not sufficient or
persuasive in this case because the fees sufficiently show that Plaintiff’s
counsel was working on the case for which they were the prevailing party.  The Court need not separate the causes of
action.
 
2)     
Reasonableness
The
Court is in the best position to establish the reasonableness of attorney’s
fees.  (PLCM Group, supra,
22 Cal.4th at1095.)
Plaintiff
requests $80,026.70 for attorneys’ hours and $11,887.09 in costs for a total of
$91,913.79.  Plaintiffs request an hourly
fee between $175 and $595 based on attorney status and time employed, attesting
that the salary of each attorney, assistant and paralegal is reflective of
their skill and time employed.  The Court
finds this evidence sufficient to show the hourly rate is reasonable.  There is no evidence submitted that the
hourly rates reasonable in San Jose are somehow unreasonable in Los Angeles.  
Plaintiff
also included the billing records to support their 205.4 hours spent on this
case.  The Court finds the time spent
reasonable.  
Therefore,
the Court awards $80,026.70 in attorney’s fees.
 
3)     
Costs
Plaintiffs
submitted their Memorandum of Costs, requesting a total of $11,887.09 in costs.
Defendant requests that the entirety of costs be denied because they allege
that without the causes of action for contractual damages and interest rates,
this “case never should have been initiated before [t]his court.”  
The
Court finds that the costs appear proper on their face.  Defendant does not challenge any particular
cost.  Rather, Defendant alleges that all
of the costs were unnecessary and unreasonable based on their supposition that
the case may not have been brought to court if Plaintiff’s causes of action
were different. This is not a proper objection, and therefore, the Court awards
costs as requested, $11,887.09. 
 
CONCLUSION 
The
court grants Plaintiff’s motion for attorney’s fees and costs and awards
$91,931.79 to Plaintiff.
Plaintiff
shall give notice.
