 Case Number:  BC487908    Hearing Date:   October 11, 2024    Dept:  74 June Duley v. _Depuy Inc. et al.
Defendant Depuy Inc.’s Motion for
Sanctions.
 
BACKGROUND 
            This
case arises out of a products liability claim. 

            On
July 6, 2012, plaintiff Jane Duley (Plaintiff) filed a complaint that that she
was implanted with a defective orthopedic implant which was made by Dupey
Orthopedics, Inc. (Defendant). In April 2024, the court entered two sanctions
orders against Plaintiff for her failure to produce discovery. The first order
entered on April 12 imposed $1,665.00 in sanctions and an order entered three
days later on April 15 imposed $1,110.00 in sanctions. Plaintiff has paid
neither sanctions award and has not produced the demanded discovery. On July 9,
Defendant filed this motion seeking evidentiary and issue sanctions for
Plaintiff’s violations of this court’s discovery orders. Plaintiff has not
filed an opposition.
             The court finds Plaintiff’s failure to comply
with discovery orders is willful. The court further finds lesser sanctions will
not bring about compliance. Given that less severe sanctions failed to produce
compliance with discovery and the non-compliance was willful, the Count finds
that issue and evidence sanctions are warranted.
Defendant
requests $3,272.50 in monetary sanctions based on 4.5 hours of attorney time to
prepare the motion, which the court will award. Defendant also requests 1 hour to
prepare a reply, which the court rejects because Plaintiff did not oppose the
motion. The court finds Defendant’s hourly rate of $595 is reasonable and orders
Plaintiff to pay Defendant’s attorney $2,677.50 in attorney’s fees.
The
court will sign Defendant’s proposed order filed on July 9, 2024, as modified
to award $2,677.50 in sanctions.
Defendant
shall give notice.
