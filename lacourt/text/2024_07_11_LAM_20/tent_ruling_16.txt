 On October 23, 2023, Plaintiffs Jessica Spratt, Steven Spratt, and Carla Whalen filed the operative Complaint against their landlords, Defendants James M. Ward and Duopoly, LLC, for (1) breach of contract, (2) breach of implied warranty of habitability, (3) breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment, (4) negligence, (5) breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, (6) private nuisance, (7) premises liability, (8) retaliatory acts, and (9) violation of LA TAHO.On May 14, 2024, Defendants filed a Cross-Complaint against Plaintiffs for (1) breach of contract, (2) fraud, and (3) defamation.  Plaintiffs now seek to strike the entirety of the third cause of action for defamation in the Cross-Complaint pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. § 425.16.  Alternatively, Plaintiffs seek to strike portions of the defamation claim. Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16 sets forth the procedure governing anti-SLAPP motions.  In pertinent part, the statute states, “A cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person’s right of petition or free speech under the United States Constitution or the California Constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike, unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 425.16(b)(1).)  The purpose of the statute is to identify and dispose of lawsuits brought to chill the valid exercise of a litigant’s constitutional right of petition or free speech.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 425.16(a); Sylmar Air Conditioning v. Pueblo Contracting Services, Inc. (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 1049, 1055-1056.)Courts employ a two-step process to evaluate anti-SLAPP motions.  (Equilon Enterprises v. Consumer Cause, Inc. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 53, 61.)  To invoke the protections of the statute, the defendant must first show that the challenged lawsuit arises from protected activity, such as an act in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech.  (Ibid.)  From this fact, courts “ ‘presume the purpose of the action was to chill the defendant’s exercise of First Amendment rights.  It is then up to the plaintiff to rebut the presumption by showing a reasonable probability of success on the merits.’ ”  (Ibid.)  In determining whether the plaintiff has carried this burden, the trial court considers “the pleadings, and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 425.16(b)(2); see Soukup v. Law Offices of Herbert Hafif (2006) 39 Cal.4th 260, 291 (“Soukup”).)Protected Activity To meet their burden for the first prong of the anti-SLAPP analysis, Plaintiffs must demonstrate that the defamation claim arises from protected activity.  That is, it must be that “defendant’s conduct by which plaintiff claims to have been injured falls within one of the four categories described in subdivision (e) . . . ‘the act underlying the plaintiff’s cause’ or ‘the at which forms the basis for the plaintiff’s cause of action’ must itself have been an act in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech.’ ”  (Equilon Enterprises v. Consumer Cause, Inc. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 53, 63 (internal citations omitted).)  An “ ‘act in furtherance of a person’s right of petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue’ includes: (1) any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative, executive, or judicial proceeding, or any other official proceeding authorized by law, (2) any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any other official proceeding authorized by law, (3) any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest, or (4) any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 425.16(e).)Plaintiffs argue that the subject defamation claim arises from protected activity under Code Civ. Proc. § 425.16(e)(2)-(4).Defendants’ defamation claim alleges that Plaintiffs appeared on television for KTLA and stated: a. Cross-Complainant was a slumlord; b. Cross-Complainant refused to make repairs; c. Cross-Complainant refused to take complaints seriously; d. Cross-Complainant told her to just get a cat for the rodent problem and falsely stated that Cross-Complainant called the mice “mosies;” e. When her family returned to the remediated house, nothing had been done; andf. There was mold at the property.(Cross-Compl. ¶ 30.)  Defendants also allege that “Cross-Defendants provided pictures and videos to the news team which were not current, but assembled together, created a false representation of the current situation at the property.”  (Cross-Compl ¶  32.)   Plaintiffs have carried their burden to show that the allegations arise from protected activity under Code Civ. Proc. § 425.16(e)(3).  “The definition of ‘public interest’ within the meaning of the anti-SLAPP statute has been broadly construed to include not only governmental matters, but also private conduct that impacts a broad segment of society and/or that affects a community in a manner similar to that of a governmental entity.”  (Damon v. Ocean Hills Journalism Club (2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 468, 479.)  A statement concerns a “public issue” where it either “[(1)] concerned a person or entity in the public eye [Citations], [(2)] conduct that could directly affect a large number of people beyond the direct participants [Citations] or [(3)] a topic of widespread, public interest.”  (Rivero v. Am. Fed'n of State, Cty., & Mun. Employees, AFL-CIO (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 913, 924.)For the purposes of Code Civ. Proc. § 425.16(e)(3), “[a] ‘public forum’ is traditionally defined as a place that is open to the public where information is freely exchanged.”  (Damon, supra, 85 Cal.App.4th at p. 475.)   Here, the subject statements relate to a matter of public interest because they pertain to misconduct by a local landlord that garnered a television audience and that could be relevant to any individual seeking to rent property from Defendants.  Indeed, “an issue of public interest’ within the meaning of section 425.16, subdivision (e)(3) is any issue in which the public is interested.’ ”  (Nygard, Inc. v. Uusi-Kerttula (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 1027, 1042.)  Actually, KTLA’s YouTube video of the incident, which includes Plaintiffs’ statements, has nearly 19,000 views alone.  (https://youtu.be/nLEqoC3WUkQ?si=63CYmppgHh_pSp1g.) Furthermore, the statements were made in a public forum to the extent uttered on television on KTLA, which is known to be broadcast widely throughout Southern California.  (See, e.g., Annette F. v. Sharon S. (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 1146, 1161 [A “news publication is a ‘public forum’ within the meaning of the anti-SLAPP statute if it is a vehicle for discussion of public issues and it is distributed to a large and interested community.”].)   Defendants merely argue that the statements are not a matter of public interest because they are false and misleading.  Defendants have confused the analysis for the two prongs of the anti-SLAPP framework.  The falsity of Plaintiffs’ statements pertains to the merit of Defendants’ claim for the second prong.  The first prong merely examines whether the statements were a matter of public interest, which is to be construed broadly.   The Court concludes that the defamation claim arises from protected activity under Code Civ. Proc. § 425.16(e)(3) and that Plaintiffs have carried their burden.Minimal MeritOn the second component of the analysis, courts employ a “summary-judgment-like” procedure, “accepting as true the evidence favorable to the plaintiff and evaluating the defendant’s evidence only to determine whether the defendant has defeated the plaintiff’s evidence as a matter of law.”  (Gerbosi v. Gaims, Weil, West & Epstein, LLP (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 435, 444.)  In other words, the Court does not assess credibility, and the plaintiff is not required to meet the preponderance of the evidence standard.  The Court accepts as true the evidence favorable to the plaintiff, who need only establish that his or her claim has “minimal merit” to avoid being stricken as a SLAPP.  (Soukup, supra, 39 Cal.4th at p. 291.)The tort of defamation consists of (1) a publication that is (2) false, (3) defamatory, and (4) unprivileged, and that (5) has a natural tendency to injure or that causes special damage.  (Taus v. Loftus (2007) 40 Cal.4th 683, 720.)  Where, as here, the subject statements involve a public issue, a private figure cannot obtain “presumed and punitive damages absent a showing of ‘actual malice.’ ”  (Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc. (1985) 472 U.S. 749, 756; Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc. (1974) 418 U.S. 323, 349; Brown v. Kelly (1989) 48 Cal.3d 711, 747 [“A private-figure plaintiff must prove at least negligence to recover any damages and, when the speech involves a matter of public concern, he must also prove New York Times malice, supra, 376 U.S. 254, to recover presumed or punitive damages.”]  Here, Defendants’ one declaration does not establish pecuniary damages arising directly from the statements themselves and in fact hardly discusses the effects of the defamatory statements at all.  The only expenses discussed relate to efforts at (a) remediation, (b) providing alternate housing, and (c) providing payment to induce Plaintiffs to vacate.  These are not pecuniary damages caused by the defamatory statements.  Therefore, for the purposes of this Motion, Defendants must show actual malice to establish a right to presumed damages.  Actual malice requires that the statement at issue be made “with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.”  (New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964) 376 U.S. 254, 280.)  “[R]eckless conduct is not measured by whether a reasonably prudent man would have published, or would have investigated before publishing. There must be sufficient evidence to permit the conclusion that the defendant in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his publication. Publishing with such doubts shows reckless disregard for truth or falsity and demonstrates actual malice.” (P. 731, 88 S.Ct. at p. 1325.)The quoted language establishes a subjective test, under which the defendant's actual belief concerning the truthfulness of the publication is the crucial issue. (See Alioto v. Cowles Communications, Inc. (N.D.Cal.1977) 430 F.Supp. 1363, 1365–1366.) This test directs attention to the “defendant's attitude toward the truth or falsity of the material published ... [not] the defendant's attitude toward the plaintiff.” (Widener v. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (1977) 75 Cal.App.3d 415, 434, 142 Cal.Rptr. 304.). . . [A]ctual malice can be proved by circumstantial evidence. “[E]vidence of negligence, of motive and of intent may be adduced for the purpose of establishing, by cumulation and by appropriate inferences, the fact of a defendant's recklessness or of his knowledge of falsity.” (Goldwater v. Ginzburg (2d Cir.1969) 414 F.2d 324, 342; Widener v. Pacific Gas & Electric Co., supra, 75 Cal.App.3d 415, 434, 142 Cal.Rptr. 304.) A failure to investigate (see Widener v. Pacific Gas & Electric Co., supra, 75 Cal.App.3d 415, 434, 142 Cal.Rptr. 304), anger and hostility toward the plaintiff (id., at p. 436, 142 Cal.Rptr. 304), reliance upon sources known to be unreliable (Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts, supra, 388 U.S. 130, 156, 87 S.Ct. 1975, 1992, 18 L.Ed.2d 1094; Pep v. Newsweek, Inc. (S.D.N.Y.1983) 553 F.Supp. 1000, 1002), or known to be biased against the plaintiff (Fisher v. Larsen (1982) 138 Cal.App.3d 627, 640, 188 Cal.Rptr. 216; Burns v. McGraw-Hill Broadcasting Co., Inc. (Colo.1983) 659 P.2d 1351, 1361–1362)—such factors may, in an appropriate case, indicate that the publisher himself had serious doubts regarding the truth of his publication.(Reader's Digest Assn., supra, 37 Cal.3d at pp. 256–58.)Actual malice must be shown by “clear and convincing evidence”, and—on a summary judgment or anti-SLAPP motion—the plaintiff must meet her burden by demonstrating that “the evidence and all the inferences which can reasonably be drawn from it . . . meet the higher standard.”  (Id. at p. 252.)  The Motion “should be granted unless it appears that actual malice may be proved at trial by clear and convincing evidence.”  (Basich v. Allstate Ins. Co. (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 1112, 1119.)  Here, Defendants have not presented evidence approaching the “clear and convincing” standard that Plaintiffs’ statements were made with knowledge of or reckless disregard of falsity.  There are no documents provided whatsoever.  In essence, Defendants state that they have expended large sums of money to remediate any defects at the property and that there are text messages that could prove this.  Defendants’ one declaration, without attachments, merely creates an ordinary factual dispute and does not approach the “clear and convincing” standard.  Defendants have failed to establish an element of their claim—damages.Because Defendants have not carried their burden to show a reasonable probability of prevailing on their defamation claim, the Anti-SLAPP Motion is granted.  Plaintiffs’ Request for Judicial Notice is granted.  Moving parties to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
