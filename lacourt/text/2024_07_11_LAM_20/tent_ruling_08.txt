 On May 16, 2024, among other things, the Court deemed admitted certain requests for admission propounded on Plaintiffs John P. Middleton and The John Powers Middleton Companies, LLC. Plaintiffs now seek relief from the Court’s May, 16, 2024, order.Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(a) provides that the Court may relieve a party from its waiver of objection when “(1) The party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with [the Code of Civil Procedure, and] (2) The party's failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” Plaintiffs indicate that: “Code complaint Responses were served on May 2, 2024. On May 16, 2024, the RFAs, however, were deemed admitted through two mistakes by counsel. As outlined in the accompanying declaration, the response date did not get properly calendared. As outlined below, the reason for the failure to proper calendar the responses justifies the relief sought herein. Moreover, the second error was not notifying the Court in advance of the May 16th Motion that Responses had already been served.” It seems that responses to the requests for admission had been served prior to the May 16, 2024, hearing.  Thus, the Motion to Deem Admitted should have been denied.  The Court finds that the May 16, 2024, order arose from Plaintiffs’ counsel’s excusable neglect.  Thus, the Motion is granted. Moving parties to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
