Defendant Trancas PCH LLC seeks to dismiss this lawsuit because it has not been brought to trial within 5 years and 6 months.A civil action must be brought to trial within five years after it is commenced against the defendant. (Code Civ. Proc. § 583.310.)  If the action is not brought to trial within that time, dismissal is mandatory on the motion of any party or on the court’s own motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 583.360; Martinez v. Landry's Restaurants, Inc. (2018) 26 Cal.App.5th 783, 794.)An action is “brought to trial” for purposes of the five-year dismissal statute when the jury is sworn in a jury trial or when the first witness is sworn in a nonjury trial.  (Hartman v. Santamarina (1982) 30 Cal.3d 762, 765; Lakkees v. Superior Court (4th Dist. 1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 531, 536.)  A “jury” is the panel of prospective jurors, and trial commences when they are assembled in the courtroom for voir dire and sworn to tell the truth, even though the actual trial jurors selected will be sworn again.  (Stueve v. Nemer (2017) 7 Cal.App.5th 746, 752.)This action was filed on November 19, 2018.  5 years from that date is November 19, 2023.  The COVID emergency rules extended this date by 6 months, (Cal. Rules of Court, Emergency Rule 10(a)), or to May 20, 2024.  This action, however, has yet to go to trial.  Plaintiff argues that this Motion is part of a scheme concocted by Defendant in that Defendant requested and obtained a trial continuance on October 3, 2023.  Plaintiff contends it was Defendant that “typed” the Court’s minute order.  Plaintiff also argues that discovery has been obstructed by Defendant.  “In computing the time within which an action must be brought to trial pursuant to this article, there shall be excluded the time during which any of the following conditions existed:(a) The jurisdiction of the court to try the action was suspended.(b) Prosecution or trial of the action was stayed or enjoined.(c) Bringing the action to trial, for any other reason, was impossible, impracticable, or futile.”(Code Civ. Proc. § 583.340.)There is no contention that subsections (a)-(b) above apply.  The issue is whether subsection (c) applies.“In determining whether the impossibility exception applies, courts have crafted a three-part test. Under this test, the plaintiff has the burden to prove (1) a circumstance of impossibility, (2) a causal connection between that circumstance and the plaintiff's reason for not bringing the action to trial, and (3) the plaintiff's reasonable diligence in trying to bring the action to trial.”  (O'Connor's California Practice * Civil Pretrial Ch. 10-F § 4 (2024 ed.).)Nothing has been cited to indicate that discovery challenges qualify as an impossibility or impracticability for the purposes of Code Civ. Proc. § 583.340.With regard to the contention that Defendant’s chose the current trial date, the truth is that it was the Court that selected July 29, 2024, as the trial date—not Defendant.  Actually, Defendant’s ex parte application requested that the trial be continued to “a date in the February-March 2024 timeframe”.  Notably, the court clerk setting a late trial date is not grounds to establish impossibility.  (Cent. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Exec. Motor Home Sales, Inc. (Ct. App. 1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 791, 796.)On the other hand, due to illness, the Judicial Officer of this department has been unavailable for a jury trial from April through June 2024.  This is an impossibility that made it such that trial could not be commended until July 2024.  That means the time to bring the suit to trial was tolled by almost two months. Therefore, the current July 29, 2024, trial date is still within the 5-year rule.  The Court also does not see how Plaintiff has not been diligent when he is a pro per litigant and Defendant has requested at least two trial continuances since August 2023.   For these reasons, the Motion to Dismiss is denied. Defendant also seeks terminating sanctions, contending that Plaintiff has abused the discovery process.  Nothing has been cited to indicate that such a motion—which relates to discovery—can be combined with an ordinary motion to dismiss.  Thus, Defendant’s request is rejected.  Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
