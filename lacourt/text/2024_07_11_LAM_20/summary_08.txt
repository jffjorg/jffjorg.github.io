And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that a motion to deem admitted certain requests for admission should be granted. The motion was filed by Plaintiffs John P. Middleton and The John Powers Middleton Companies, LLC, who are seeking relief from the Court's May 16, 2024, order. The Court found that the order was the result of excusable neglect by Plaintiffs' counsel, who failed to properly calendar the response date and did not notify the Court in advance of the May 16th Motion. Despite the responses to the requests for admission having been served prior to the May 16, 2024, hearing, the Court deemed them admitted. The judge has granted the motion and is granting relief from the Court's May 16, 2024, order.
