 Gibson, Dunn, & Crutcher LLP (“GD”) seeks to seal (1) Mark Perry’s opposition to the Petition to Vacate Award and (2) GD’s reply thereto, as well as the instant Motions themselves.    Unless confidentiality is required by law, court records are presumed to be open to public review.  (Cal. Rules of Court 2.550(c); see also Cal. Const., art. I, § 3, subd. (b)(1) [“The people have the right of access to information concerning the conduct of the people’s business”].)  “The court may order that a record be filed under seal only if it expressly finds facts that establish: (1) There exists an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record; (2) The overriding interest supports sealing the record; (3) A substantial probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed; (4) The proposed sealing is narrowly tailored; and (5) No less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.550(d); see also NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc. v. Superior Court (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178, 1217-1218.)The basis for the Motions is substantially the same as the requests to seal that were heard on June 27, 2024.  The Court incorporates by reference its June 27, 2024, order, and hereby enters the same ruling on the instant Motions.  Thus, the Motions to Seal are granted in part. The Court notes that GD has also set a motion to seal as to its opposition to the former partners’ motion to unseal for July 25, 2024.  If there is no objection, that Motion is advanced to this date and also granted in part to the same extent as the other motions discussed herein.GD to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
