And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a lawsuit filed by the plaintiff against Trancas PCH LLC. The defendant seeks to dismiss the lawsuit because it has not been brought to trial within 5 years and 6 months, citing California Code of Civil Procedure § 583.310 and Martinez v. Landry's Restaurants, Inc. (2018) 26 Cal.App.5th 783, 794. The plaintiff argues that the case should not be dismissed, citing obstacles and diligence.

The judge has ruled that the case should not be dismissed, citing California Code of Civil Procedure § 583.340 and O'Connor's California Practice * Civil Pretrial Ch. 10-F § 4 (2024 ed.). The judge found that the Judicial Officer's unavailability due to illness from April to June 2024 was an impossibility that made it impossible to bring the case to trial until July 2024. The judge also found that the plaintiff has been diligent in pursuing the case, despite being a pro per litigant and despite the defendant's request for multiple trial continuances.

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to dismiss and has rejected the defendant's request for terminating sanctions, citing California Rules of Court, Emergency Rule 10(a) and Cent. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Exec. Motor Home Sales, Inc. (Ct. App. 1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 791, 796. The judge has encouraged the parties to resolve their disputes amicably and has reminded them that the COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing.
