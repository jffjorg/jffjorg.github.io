And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a Motion for Sanctions filed by Plaintiff David Wetmore against Defendant Bureau Veritas Commodities and Trade, Inc. The Plaintiff is seeking issue, evidentiary, and monetary sanctions against the Defendant for allegedly failing to comply with the parties' April 2023 stipulation regarding discovery requests. The Defendant argued that the Motion is untimely, but the Court rejected this argument. The Judge found that while some of the Defendant's responses are non-compliant, they do not warrant issue or evidentiary sanctions, and instead, the Plaintiff should have moved to compel further responses in a timely fashion. The Judge will award reduced monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,000, but will deny the Motion for all other relief.
