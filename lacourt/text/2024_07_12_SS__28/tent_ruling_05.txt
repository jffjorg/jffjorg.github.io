 Case Number:  BC692873    Hearing Date:   July 12, 2024    Dept:  28 Having  considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers, the Court rules as  follows.  BACKGROUND  On February 6, 2018, Plaintiff Billy Parker (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against  Defendants Jessica Monique Rios, FC Pac Holdings LLC, Kan Di Ki LLC dba  Diagnostic Laboratories, and Does 1-50 for motor vehicle tort and general  negligence.  On  March 12, 2018, Defendants Jessica Monique Rios and Kan Di Ki, LLC dba  Diagnostic Laboratories filed an answer.  On  March 27, 2018, the Court dismissed Defendant FC Pac Holdings LLC without prejudice at Plaintiff’s request.  On  January 15, 2021, the Court appointed Kayla Sullivan to act as guardian ad  litem for Sean Parker Sullivan.  On  September 2, 2021, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to substitute Sean  Parker Sullivan, by and through his guardian ad litem Kayla Sullivan, as  successor-in-interest to Plaintiff, who passed away on March 20, 2019.  On  July 25, 2022, the Court set an order to show cause re: dismissal (settlement)  for August 29, 2022. On  August 29, 2022, the Court continued the order to show cause to October 28,  2022.  Plaintiff’s counsel stated that  signature of the release was pending.  On  October 28, 2022, the Court continued the order to show cause to February 1,  2023 after Plaintiff’s counsel stated that the settlement was being finalized.  On  February 1, 2023, the Court continued the order to show cause at Plaintiff’s  request to April 5, 2023.  On April 5, 2023, the Court continued the order to  show cause at Plaintiff’s request to June 13, 2023.  On June 13, 2023, the Court continued the order to  show cause to July 28, 2023 based on the parties’ oral stipulation.  Counsel stated they needed more time to  obtain signatures on the settlement release.  On  July 28, 2023, at Defendant’s request, the Court continued the order to show  cause to August 31, 2023.  On August  31, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel did not appear.  At Defendant’s request, the Court continued  the order to show cause to November 9, 2023.   The Court ordered Plaintiff to appear on November 9, 2023.  On November 9, 2023, no party or counsel appeared or  contacted the Court.  The case had been  pending for more than five years and six months. The Court dismissed the case without prejudice.   On  May 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to set aside or vacate the dismissal, to  be heard on July 12, 2024.  On June 28,  2024, Defendants FC Pac Holdings LLC, Jessica Monique Rios, and Kan Di Ki, LLC dba  Diagnostic Laboratories (“Defendants”) filed an opposition.  On July 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply.  On July 12, 2024, the Court issued a tentative ruling and heard argument from Plaintiff's counsel.  (Defendant's counsel did not appear.) PARTIES’ REQUESTS  Plaintiff  asks the Court to set aside the dismissal under Code of Civil Procedure section  473, subdivision (b).  Defendants  ask the Court to deny the motion.  LEGAL STANDARD  A.   Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b)  Code  of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), provides in part:  “Notwithstanding any other requirements of this  section, the court shall, whenever an application for relief is made no more  than six months after entry of judgment, is in proper form, and is accompanied  by an attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence,  surprise, or neglect, vacate any (1) resulting default entered by the clerk  against his or her client, and which will result in entry of a default  judgment, or (2) resulting default judgment or dismissal entered against his or  her client, unless the court finds that the default or dismissal was not in  fact caused by the attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. The  court shall, whenever relief is granted based on an attorney’s affidavit of  fault, direct the attorney to pay reasonable compensatory legal fees and costs  to opposing counsel or parties. However, this section shall not lengthen the  time within which an action shall be brought to trial pursuant to Section  583.310.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473,  subd. (b).)  B.   Dismissal for failure to bring a case to trial within  five years  Code  of Civil Procedure section 583.310 provides that “An action shall be brought to  trial within five years after the action is commenced against the defendant.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §  583.310.)  On April 6, 2020, the  Judicial Council issued Emergency rule 10(a), which provides: “Notwithstanding  any other law, including Code of Civil Procedure section 583.310, for all civil  actions filed on or before April 6, 2020, the time in which to bring the action  to trial is extended by six months for a total time of five years and six months.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, appen. I, Emergency rule 10(a); see Barron v. Santa  Clara County Valley Transportation Authority (2023) 97 Cal.App.5th 1115, 1123.)  Code  of Civil Procedure section 583.340 provides:  “In computing the time within which an action must be  brought to trial pursuant to this article, there shall be excluded the time  during which any of the following conditions existed:  “(a) The jurisdiction of the court to try the action  was suspended.  “(b) Prosecution or trial of the action was stayed or  enjoined.  “(c) Bringing the action to trial, for any other  reason, was impossible, impracticable, or futile.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 583.340.)  Code  of Civil Procedure section 583.360 provides:  “(a) An action shall be dismissed by the court on its  own motion or on motion of the defendant, after notice to the parties, if the  action is not brought to trial within the time prescribed in this article.  “(b) The requirements of this article are mandatory  and are not subject to extension, excuse, or exception except as expressly  provided by statute.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 583.360.)  DISCUSSION  The Court’s November 9, 2023 order dismissing the case did  not state the basis for dismissal.  The  parties appear to assume the Court dismissed the case because Plaintiff’s  counsel did not appear at the hearing as ordered.  Accordingly, Plaintiff  argues that his counsel’s failure to appear at the August 31, 2023 and November  9, 2023 order to show cause hearings resulted from the inadvertence of  counsel’s paralegal, who failed to calendar the hearing dates.  Plaintiff has provided an attorney  declaration attesting to his attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, and excusable  neglect.  The parties' papers do not address whether the Court was required to dismiss the case under  Code of Civil Procedure section 583.360 for failure to bring it to trial within five years and six months after Plaintiff filed the complaint on February 6, 2018.  The  time during which an enforceable settlement is in effect is excluded when computing  the time that a case has been pending under Code of Civil Procedure section 583.340,  subdivision (c).  (See Gorman v. Holte  (1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 984, 987 [parties “stipulated to the terms of the  settlement on the record in open court” and “there remained no issues to be  tried after the parties had arrived at a complete settlement of their dispute”];  Brown & Bryant, Inc. v. Hartford Accident & Indemnity Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 247, 250 [parties “executed a  written ‘Settlement Agreement and Release’ ”]; Schiro v. Curci (1990) 220  Cal.App.3d 840, 843 [parties’ settlement was enforceable under Code of Civil  Procedure section 664.6]; Canal Street, Ltd. v. Sorich (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th  602, 608 [“the time during which a settlement agreement is in effect tolls the  five-year period, for the reason that attempting to bring an action to trial  when all issues have been resolved through settlement would be futile”]; id.  at pp. 604-605 [parties placed settlement on record at judicially mandated  settlement conference].) The parties here did not place the  terms of a settlement agreement on the record and do not assert in their papers that an  enforceable settlement agreement existed before the Court dismissed the case. At the July 12, 2024 argument on Plaintiff's motion, Plaintiff's counsel asserted that a "settlement in principle" existed which tolled the running of the five-year period, avoiding the mandatory dismissal requirement of Code of Civil Procedure section 583.360.The Court continues the hearing on Plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal to give the parties an opportunity to address whether a settlement tolled the time to bring the case to trial (or excluded time from the running of the five-year period) for purposes of Code of Civil Procedure section 583.340, subdivision (c).  The Court continues the hearing to August 23, 2024.  The parties may submit supplemental briefs no later than five court days before the August 23, 2024 hearing. CONCLUSION  The  Court CONTINUES the hearing on Plaintiff’s motion to set aside the dismissal to August 23, 2024 at 1:30 p.m. in Department 28 of the Spring Street Courthouse. No later than five court days before the August 23, 2024 hearing, the parties may file supplemental briefs addressing whether a settlement tolled the time to bring the case to trial (or excluded time from the running of the five-year period) for purposes of Code of Civil Procedure section 583.340, subdivision (c). Moving  party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Moving  party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court  within five days.
