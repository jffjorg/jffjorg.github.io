Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers and rules as follows. The Plaintiff, Julio Alberto Pineda, has filed a complaint against the Estate of Larry Edward Voit and others for general negligence. The Court has granted Barrett Business Services, Inc.'s motion to intervene, and the Plaintiff has amended the complaint to include additional defendants. Corona Aircraft Engines, Inc., doing business as Corona Engines, has filed a demurrer to the complaint, arguing that the Plaintiff has failed to plead facts showing Corona's negligence or causation of the Plaintiff's injuries. The Court sustains the demurrer, finding that the Plaintiff has not adequately alleged Corona's acts or omissions that constitute negligence or caused the Plaintiff's injuries. The Court gives the Plaintiff 30 days' leave to amend the complaint and orders the moving parties to give notice of this ruling and file proof of service with the Court within five days.
