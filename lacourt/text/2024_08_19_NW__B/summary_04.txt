And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for a default judgment against Defendant AA Yellow Company Inc. The plaintiff originally sued Defendant Uber Technologies Inc. and Defendant Anthony DOE for general negligence after suffering personal injuries as a passenger in Defendant Anthony's vehicle. The plaintiff is seeking compensatory damages of $2,000,000.00 and other damages. However, the court has rejected the plaintiff's prior attempts to file a default judgment application due to incomplete paperwork. The latest attempt was also denied due to the same deficiencies. The court notes that the plaintiff has failed to provide any evidentiary support or further itemization of damages and has not provided a proposed judgment. As a result, the court must deny the plaintiff's request for default.
