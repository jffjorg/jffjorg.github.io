**Significant Statements**
```
"Premises liability is grounded in the possession of the premises and the attendant right to control and manage the premises."
"If the photos Plaintiff provides are accurate, they show nothing outside the typical sidewalk lay persons encounter daily."
"It is well within the common knowledge of lay judges and jurors just what type of a defect in a sidewalk is dangerous."
"The Court deems that not only was there no actual nor constructive notice, but that the alleged defect was trivial."
```
And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the County of Los Angeles' Motion for Summary Judgment. The motion was filed by the Defendant, the County of Los Angeles, seeking summary judgment against the Plaintiff's claims of premises liability and negligence. The Plaintiff, Farideh Raubitschek, alleges that she tripped and fell on a hole in the sidewalk located at 4600 Via Marina, California 90292, which is owned and maintained by the County of Los Angeles. The Defendant claims that it did not create the dangerous condition, did not have actual or constructive notice of the condition, and that causation is absent.

The Judge finds that the Defendant has met its burden of showing that the Plaintiff cannot establish a triable issue of material fact as to any of the claims. The Judge concludes that the Defendant did not create the dangerous condition, that there was no actual or constructive notice of the condition, and that causation is absent. The Judge finds that the alleged defect was trivial and that the Defendant's inspection of the property before the incident showed no dangerous condition. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff's own testimony does not support the element of causation.

Accordingly, the Judge grants the County of Los Angeles' Motion for Summary Judgment and orders the Defendant to give notice and submit a proposed judgment for the Court's signature.
