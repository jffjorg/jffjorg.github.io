DISCUSSION
 
This
action against AA Yellow Cab is brought by Plaintiff Pruitt and arises out of
Plaintiff’s ride as a lawful passenger on December 15, 2019, while in Defendant
Anthony DOE’s rideshare vehicle. Plaintiff alleges Defendant Doe drove in an
unsafe manner and was speeding over several dips and/or speed bumps on the road
which caused Plaintiff severe injuries.
 
The
Complaint was filed on November 30, 2021, and on October 5, 2023, Plaintiff
added AA Yellow Company as a Doe after dismissing Defendant Uber. Plaintiff
filed a CIV-100 on April 12, 2024 and then again on April 17, 2024 which the
Court rejected on April 17, and April 19 of 2024, respectively, for being
incomplete. The Court noted the deficiencies therein.
 
The
Court notes that Plaintiff does not set forth an amount in damages in the
complaint but provides a Statement of Damages requesting a total of
$2,000,000.00 in special and general damages. There are no declarations or
exhibits corresponding with the statement of damages.
 
Moreover,
the same deficiencies remain which were specified in the Court’s prior Notices
of Rejection on April 17 and 19, 2024.
 
Damages 
 
Plaintiff seeks (in excess of) $1,000,000.00 in general
damages and (in excess of) $1,000,000.00 in special damages but does not
provide any evidentiary support or further itemization of damages. There are no
exhibits or supporting declarations attached to the complaint or any of the
default papers. There also is no proposed judgment.
 
Costs
 
            There is no memorandum or
itemization of costs in the CIV-100.  The
Court has pointed this out in its previous rejections of default because
Plaintiff continues to leave blank material sections of the CIV-100. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Accordingly,
the Court must DENY Plaintiff’s Request for Default for failure to
comply with the requirements of CRC Rule 3.1800.
