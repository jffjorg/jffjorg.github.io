Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on CA-Lats South, LLC's motion for summary judgment. The motion is based on the grounds that the alleged dangerous condition was so open, obvious, and avoidable that CA-Lats had no duty to warn or remedy the condition, and that CA-Lats had no notice of a dangerous condition. The Judge finds that CA-Lats has met its initial burden, and the burden now shifts to the Plaintiff.

The Judge reviews the evidence and finds that a triable issue of material fact exists as to whether CA-Lats knew or should have known of the subject parking block's dangerous condition. The Judge notes that the parking block was in a location that made it "so open, obvious, and avoidable" and that CA-Lats had no reports of any incidents involving the subject parking block. The Judge also notes that the Plaintiff was familiar with the parking garage and had used her parking pass on at least 65 separate occasions prior to her fall.

The Judge denies CA-Lats' motion for summary judgment and orders CA-Lats to give notice. The Judge concludes that a triable issue of material fact exists as to whether CA-Lats knew or should have known of the subject parking block's dangerous condition.
