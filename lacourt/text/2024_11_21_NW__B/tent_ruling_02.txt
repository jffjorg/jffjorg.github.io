 Case Number:  22STCV18559    Hearing Date:   November 21, 2024    Dept:  B [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: DEFENDANT/CROSS-COMPLAINANT CA-LATS SOUTH, LLC’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT Dept. B DATE: November 21, 2024 TIME: 8:30 A.M. COMPLAINT FILED: JUNE 7, 2022 TRIAL DATE: FEBRUARY 24, 2025I. BACKGROUNDOn June 7, 2022, Plaintiff Tracy Lynn Kamar (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants Parking Concepts, Inc. (“Parking Concepts”), and Does 1 to 25 (collectively “Defendants”) alleging two causes of action: (1) general negligence; and (2) premises liability. The complaint arises from a February 25, 2022, incident where Plaintiff allegedly sustained serious injuries after tripping over Defendants’ negligently placed parking block.On November 22, 2022, Plaintiff filed an amendment to their complaint identifying CA-Lats South, LLC (“CA-Lats”) as Doe 1.On July 12, 2023, CA-Lats filed a cross-complaint against Parking Concepts for (1) equitable indemnity; (2) contribution; (3) express contractual indemnity; and (4) declaratory relief.On June 5, 2024, the matter was reassigned to the Honorable Judge Moskowitz in Department B of Van Nuys Courthouse East, effective June 24, 2024.On June 18, 2024, CA-Lats filed the instant motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff’s complaint.On November 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed their opposition.On October 15, 2024, CA-Lats filed their reply.II. MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENTCA-Lats moves for summary judgment on Plaintiff’s complaint on the following grounds: (1) the alleged dangerous condition was so open, obvious, and avoidable that CA-Lats had no duty to warn or remedy the condition; and (2) CA-Lats had no notice of a dangerous condition. Therefore, CA-Lats argues that they do not owe Plaintiff a duty as a matter of law. (Notice of Motion, p. 2:12-16.)III. LEGAL STANDARDSBurden on Summary Judgment or Summary AdjudicationIn reviewing a motion for summary judgment, the Court must apply a three-step analysis: (1) identify the issues framed by the pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has met his or her initial burden; and (3) determine whether the opposition has demonstrated the existence of a triable, material factual issue. (Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.) “[T]he initial burden is always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no triable issues of material fact.” (Scalf v. D.B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) A defendant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if the partyhas shown that one or more elements of the cause of action . . . cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of action.” (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 437c(p)(2).)A moving defendant may satisfy the initial burden to show that one or more elements cannot be established by “presenting evidence that conclusively negates an element of the plaintiff's cause of action or by relying on the plaintiff's factually devoid discovery responses to show that the plaintiff does not possess, and cannot reasonably obtain, evidence to establish that element.” (Schmidt v. Citibank, N.A. (2018) 28 Cal.App.5th 1109, 1119; Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 856 [it is insufficient for the defendant to merely point out the absence of evidence.]; Gaggero v. Yura (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 884, 891.) “The defendant must present evidence, typically in the form of factually devoid discovery responses, showing that plaintiff does not have and cannot reasonably obtain evidence to support his or her claim.” (Ibid.)Unless and until a defendant meets that burden, the plaintiff has no burden to present controverting evidence. (Consumer Cause, Inc. v. SmileCare (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 454, 468 [“There is no obligation on the opposing party . . . to establish anything by affidavit unless and until the moving party has by affidavit stated facts establishing every element . . . necessary to sustain a judgment in his favor.”].) If a defendant fails to meet that burden, summary judgment must be denied, even if the plaintiff fails to file an opposition and fails to proffer any evidence.On the other hand, if the defendant “has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (CCP § 437c(p)(2).) The plaintiff may not merely rely on allegations or denials in its pleadings to show that a triable issue of material fact exists, but instead “shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to the cause of action.” (Ibid.)“If the plaintiff cannot do so, summary judgment should be granted.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 463, 467.)IV. DISCUSSIONEvidentiary ObjectionsCA-Lats objects to the ASTM 1637-19 Standard, Exhibits C through H of Philip Rosescu’s Declaration, the National Safety Council Data Sheet #597, Slips, Trips, and Falls by William English, Slip and Fall Practice by Charles E. Turnbow, and the Institute of Transportation Engineers – Traffic Engineering Handbook. These objections are not properly raised in a separate evidentiary objections memorandum and are therefore overruled. (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1354(b).)Defendant’s BurdenCA-Lats meets their initial burden.CA-Lats moves for summary judgment on Plaintiff’s complaint on the following grounds: (1) the alleged dangerous condition was so open, obvious, and avoidable that CA-Lats had no duty to warn or remedy the condition; and (2) Parking Concepts had no notice of a dangerous condition. Therefore, CA-Lats argues, they did not owe Plaintiff a duty as a matter of law. (Notice of Motion, p. 2:12-16.)The elements of a cause of action for premises liability are the same as those for negligence: duty, breach, causation, and damages. (Castellon v. U.S. Bancorp (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 994, 998.) Those who own, possess, or control property generally have a duty to exercise ordinary care in managing the property to avoid exposing others to an unreasonable risk of harm. (Annocki v. Peterson Enterprises, LLC (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 32, 37.) If a dangerous condition exists, the property owner is “under a duty to exercise ordinary care either to make thecondition reasonably safe for [customers’] use or to give a warning adequate to enable them to avoid the harm.” (Bridgman v. Safeway Stores, Inc. (1960) 53 Cal.2d 443, 446.) The existence and scope of a property owner’s duty are legal questions for the court. (Annocki, supra, 232 Cal.App.4th at p. 36.)Because the owner is not the insurer of the visitor’s personal safety . . . the owner’s actual or constructive knowledge of the dangerous condition is a key to establishing its liability.” (Ortega v. Kmart Corp. (2001) 26 Cal.4th 1200, 1206.) “[W]here the plaintiff relies on the failure to correct a dangerous condition to prove the owner’s negligence, the plaintiff has the burden of showing that the owner had notice of the defect in sufficient time to correct it.” (Ibid.) The party asserting the cause of action has the burden to prove that the owner had actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition in sufficient time to correct it.¿ (Ortega, 26 Cal.4th at 1203, 1206.) To establish liability for negligence, “[t]here must be some evidence . . . to support the conclusion that the condition had existed long enough for the proprietor, in the exercise of reasonable care, to have discovered and remedied it.”¿(Girvetz v. Boys’ Market (1949) 91 Cal.App.2d 827, 829; Ortega, supra, 26 Cal.4th at p. 1206.)A property owner owes no further duty to make a condition reasonably safe or give an adequate warning of a condition when the danger of the condition is so obvious that the condition itself serves as a warning.¿(Kinsman v. Unocal Corp (2005) 37 Cal.4th 659, 673.) “[I]f the danger is so obvious that a person could reasonably be expected to see it, the condition itself serves as a warning, and the landowner is under no further duty unless harm was foreseeable despite the obvious nature of the danger.”¿(Danieley v. Goldmine Ski Associates, Inc. (1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 111, 122.) Whether a condition is obvious and whether the obviousness negates a property owner’s duty of care are legal questions for the court.¿(See Jacobs v. Coldwell BankerBrokerage Co. (2017) 14 Cal.App.5th 438, 446-450 [affirming a trial court’s granting of summary judgment based on a finding that a dangerous condition was obvious].)¿The obvious character of the condition does not negate a property owner’s duty of care to remedy a conspicuous danger when it is foreseeable that a person will encounter the danger despite the danger’s obviousness. (Martinez v. Chippeqa Enterprises, Inc. (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 1179, 1185 [indicating a dangerous condition encountered on a sole access way from the street to the defendant’s building would not negate the defendant’s duty of care owed to the plaintiff]; see also Osborn v. Mission Ready Mix (1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 104, 123 [finding an employee did not assume the risk of an obvious danger when the employee’s employment required him to encounter a dangerous condition].)Plaintiff alleges that she tripped over a parking block in a garage owned by CA-Lats. (CA-Lats Separate Statement of Facts “C-SSF” No. 2; Exh. 4 [Plaintiff’s Complaint].) The subject parking block was in a disabled-accessible parking stall. (Ibid. at No. 4; Exh. 10 [Wolfe Decl. ¶¶ 3-4]; Exh. 11 [photographs of subject parking block].) At the time of the underlying incident, there was no car in the subject stall. (Ibid. at No. 5; Exh. 12 [video surveillance footage of underlying incident].) The subject stall is outlined with 4-inch wide blue stripes and contains the painted disabled logo as required by California Building Code, Title 24, Chapter 11B. (Ibid. at No. 6; Exh. 10 [Wolfe Decl. ¶ 3]; Exh. 14 [photograph of parking stall].) The subject parking block is painted blue and set 26 inches from the right front inside stripe of the stall. (Ibid. at No. 8; Exh. 10 [Wolfe Decl. ¶ 4]; Exh. 11 [photographs of subject parking block].) Between the front of the subject stall and the parking garage wall is a 6-foot wide, blue-striped access route to the garage’s exit. (Ibid. at No. 10; Exh. 10 [Wolfe Decl. ¶ 5]; Exh. 14 [photograph of parking stall].)CA-Lats alleges that these facts show that the subject parking block was open and obvious. Further, Plaintiff’s fall was captured on surveillance video, which shows Plaintiff had aplain view of the parking block. (C-SSF Nos. 16, 17, and 21; Exh. 15 [Espana Decl. ¶ 2]; Exh. 10 [Wolfe Decl. ¶ 6]; Exh. 12 [video surveillance footage].) The footage shows Plaintiff walking directly towards the parking block. (Ibid. at No. 16; Exh. 15 [Espana Decl. ¶ 2]; Exh. 10 [Wolfe Decl. ¶ 6]; Exh. 12.) Plaintiff turns around to look behind her and, when she turns back around, she proceeds to trip over the parking block. (Ibid. at Nos. 18 and 19; Exh. 15 [Espana Decl. ¶ 2]; Exh. 10 [Wolfe Decl. ¶ 6]; Exh. 12.) No obstacles prevented Plaintiff from walking around the parking block. (Ibid. at No. 23; Exh. 15 [Espana Decl. ¶ 2]; Exh. 12.) Furthermore, Plaintiff was familiar with the parking garage as her parking pass data shows she had used her pass on at least 65 separate occasions prior to her fall. (Ibid. at No. 22; Exh. 15 [Espana Decl. ¶¶ 3-4]; Exh. 5 [parking key records].) Prior to Plaintiff’s injury, CA-Lats had no reports of any incidents involving the subject parking block. (Ibid. at No. 36; Exh. 15 [Espana Decl. ¶ 5].)CA-Lats sets forth sufficient evidence showing that the subject parking block was “so obvious that the [block] itself serve[d] as a warning.” Kinsman v. Unocal Corp (2005) 37 Cal.4th 659, 673.) A reasonable person could have been expected to see the parking block. Additionally, CA-Lats provides evidence that it had no notice or prior reports of the parking block’s dangerous condition.Accordingly, CA-Lats meets its initial burden. The burden now shifts to Plaintiff.Plaintiff’s BurdenPlaintiff argues that (1) the parking block’s dangerous condition was not open and obvious and (2) CA-Lats knew or should have known of the parking block’s dangerous condition.First, Plaintiff argues that the parking block’s dangerous condition was not open and obvious. Plaintiff argues that, at most, only three seconds elapsed between when she looked back and when she tripped over the parking block. (Plaintiff’s Separate Statement of Facts “P-SSF”No. 52; Exh. 12.) She argues that, up to the eight second mark, she did not see anything on the ground in front of her because the blue parking block blended in with the blue driver side limit line and access aisle marking. (Ibid. at Nos. 53 and 54; Exh. 1 [Kamar Depo. at 61:10-15]; Exh, 3 [Rosescu Decl. ¶¶ 7-9; Exh. B (pictures 5-10)]; Exh. 4 [Kamar Decl. ¶¶ 10 and 11].) As a result, Plaintiff argues the wheel stop was not open and obvious. However, upon review of the evidence, the Court finds that the brightly colored wheel stop stands out from the grey cement of the parking stall. Plaintiff has failed to meet her burden on this ground.Next, Plaintiff argues that CA-Lats had notice of the parking block’s dangerous condition. Parking Concepts, who managed the premises on behalf of CA-Lats, conducted monthly inspections or walkthroughs of the premises. (Ibid. at No. 57; Exh. 2 [Alvarez Depo. at 17:10-21, 48:6-19].) The subject parking block had been in its location since at least 2018. (Ibid. at No. 58; Exh. 2 [Alvarez Depo. at 43:5-21].) All the parking blocks at the subject parking garage are off-center. (Ibid. at No. 60; Exh. 2 [Alvarez Depo. at 44:17-24].) Philip Rosescu (“Rosescu”), Plaintiff’s retained safety and liability expert, is a licensed professional civil engineer. (Ibid. at No. 61; Exh. 3 [Rosescu Decl. ¶ 2].) Rosescu is currently a forensic engineer employed by Aperture, a forensic engineering firm. (Ibid. at No. 62; Exh. 3 [Rosescu Decl. ¶ 3].) In the past 15 years, Rosescu has analyzed over 5,000 accidents. (Ibid.) Rosescu provides that industry standards discourage the use of parking blocks as they can cause pedestrians to fall. (Ibid. at Nos. 68 and 72; Exh. 3 [Rosescu Decl. ¶¶ 8 and 10.) Parking blocks should be inset from the limit lines of the parking stall to ensure a free pedestrian walkway between cars. (Ibid. at No. 81; Exh. 3 [Rosescu Decl. ¶ 10(f) Exh. H [Charles E. Turnbow, Slip and Fall Practice].) If a parking block extends past the edge of a vehicle, pedestrians are likely to trip on them. (Ibid.) Further, it is industry standard to place parking blocks within the center of parking stalls. (Ibid. at No. 84; Exh. 3 [Rosescu Decl. ¶ 10(a)(iv) Exh. C [ASTM 1637-19, Section 9.4].) Here,it is undisputed that the left side of the parking block abuts the driver side limit of the parking stall. (Ibid. at No. 70; Exh. 2 [Alvarez Depo. at 42:21-44]; Exh. 3 [Rosescu Decl. ¶¶ 7-9; Exh. B (pictures 5-10)].) Therefore, upon Parking Concepts’s monthly inspections of the premises, and considering industry standards, CA-Lats knew or should have known of the subject parking block’s dangerous positioning.On summary judgment, the opposing party’s affidavits or declarations are liberally construed. (Corwin v. Los Angeles Newspaper Service Bureau, Inc. (1971) 4 Cal.3d 842, 851-852.) Therefore, Plaintiff meets her burden with evidence showing a triable issue of material fact as to whether CA-Lats knew or should have known of the subject block’s dangerous condition.V. CONCLUSIONA triable issue of material fact exists as to whether CA-Lats knew or should have known of the subject parking block’s dangerous condition. Accordingly, Defendant’s motion for summary judgment is DENIED.Moving party is ordered to give notice.Dated: November 20, 2024 __________________________________Hon.
