And here is the English text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant Alice Christian King's motion to compel Plaintiff Devin R. White's responses to Requests for Production, Set One. The Plaintiff failed to respond to the requests despite multiple extensions of time granted by the defense counsel. As a result, the Judge orders the Plaintiff to serve the Defendant with verified, objection-free responses within 20 days of the hearing. Additionally, the Judge orders the Plaintiff and their counsel to pay $760.00 in sanctions to the defense counsel within 20 days. This amount is reduced from the initial request of $1,135.00 due to the straightforward nature of the motion and lack of opposition.
