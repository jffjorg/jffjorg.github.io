And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Rebecca Alvarez v. General Motors, LLC, et al. The Court has sustained the defendant's demurrer, which means that the plaintiff's complaint does not state a cause of action for fraud. The Court has also found that the plaintiff's allegations of fraud do not meet the required specificity. The Court has also granted the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's prayer for punitive damages. The Court's tentative ruling is that the defendant's demurrer is sustained without leave to amend, and the motion to strike is mooted.
