And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a quiet title action filed by Gerold Davis, a pro per litigant. The defendant has not been served with the summons and complaint. Alejandro Alers, Jr., a non-party, has filed a motion to compel Davis to add him as a defendant, but did not provide a memorandum of points and authorities. The court construes the motion as a motion to intervene, allowing Alers to file an answer-in-intervention. The court finds that intervention is mandatory under California Code of Civil Procedure ยง 387 because Alers claims an interest in the subject property and the disposition of the action may impair or impede his ability to protect that interest. The motion is granted, and Alers is ordered to file an answer within 20 days.
