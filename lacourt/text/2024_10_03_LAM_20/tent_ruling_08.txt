 This is a quiet title action filed by Plaintiff Gerold Davis, a pro per litigant.  None of the Defendants have been served with the summons and Complaint.  Non-party Alejandro Alers, Jr., another pro per litigant, has brought a “motion to compel” Plaintiff to add Alejandro as a defendant.  Alejandro did not provide a memorandum of points and authorities.Because Alejandro is not a party, the Court construes the instant application as a motion to intervene.  That is, Alejandro seeks to file an answer-in-intervention.Plaintiff did not file an opposition.  Code Civ. Proc. § 387 provides for instances in which intervention is mandatory and discretionary.  Intervention is mandatory where “[a] provision of law confers an unconditional right to intervene [or] [t]he person seeking intervention claims an interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action and that person is so situated that the disposition of the action may impair or impede that person’s ability to protect that interest, unless that person’s interest is adequately represented by one or more of the existing parties.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 387(d)(1).)  Discretionary intervention is allowable when “the nonparty has a direct and immediate interest in the litigation; . . . [t]he intervention will not enlarge the issues in the case; and [t]he reasons for intervention outweigh any opposition by the existing parties.”  (Truck Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court (1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 342, 346.)Here, intervention appears mandatory because this is a quiet title action and Alejandro claims an interest in the subject property.  The Motion is granted.  Alejandro is ordered to file an answer within 20 days.Alejandro to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
