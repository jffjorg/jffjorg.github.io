And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge issues a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion for an order allowing the court clerk to sign quit claim deeds transferring title to the subject properties. The motion is filed by the plaintiff, Teresa J. Apolinar, against her son, Defendant Jorge Apolinar, who allegedly defrauded her into transferring title to certain real property. The court finds that the plaintiff is entitled to executed quit claim deeds transferring title to the subject properties, as the defendant has refused to sign them. The court also finds that the defendant's arguments that the motion should be denied pending the resolution of two pending actions and appeal are without merit. The court notes that the plaintiff does not consent to any stay of the enforcement of the judgment, and that the court lacks the authority to stay the execution of the judgment. The court orders the plaintiff to file a proposed order reflecting the court's ruling.
