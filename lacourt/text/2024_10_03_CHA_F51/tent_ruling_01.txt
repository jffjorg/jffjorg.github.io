BACKGROUND
 
This
action arises out of Plaintiff’s claims that her son, Defendant, defrauded her
into transferring the title to certain real property to him.¿¿ 
 
On 6/30/21, Plaintiff filed this action against
Defendant for: (1) Quiet Title; (2) Financial Elder Abuse;¿(3) Breach of
Fiduciary Duty; (4) Constructive Fraud; (5) Intentional Misrepresentation;¿(6)
Negligent Misrepresentation; (7) Conversion; (8) Cancellation of
Instruments;¿(9) Constructive Trust and (10) Accounting. On 3/1/22, Plaintiff
filed her operative first amended complaint (“FAC”) against Defendant, alleging
the same causes of action, with the additional cause of action for Resulting
Trust.
 
On 5/16/23, jury trial of the matter commenced.
On 5/23/23, the jury returned its verdict. On 8/29/23, the Court ordered
Defendant to transfer title of four properties back to Plaintiff within 30
days. On 9/26/23, the Court entered its judgment.
 
On 11/2/23, Defendant filed a notice of appeal
of both the jury trial and court trial judgments.
 
On 7/2/24, Plaintiff filed the instant motion.
On 9/20/24, Defendant filed his opposition. On 9/23/24, Plaintiff filed her
reply.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Every court has the power to
“compel obedience to its judgments, orders, and process, and to the orders of a
judge out of court, in an action or proceeding pending therein.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 128, subd. (a)(4).) “An elisor is a person appointed by the court to
perform functions like the execution of a deed or document. … A court typically
appoints an elisor to sign documents on behalf of a recalcitrant party in order
to effectuate its judgments or orders, where the party refuses to execute such
documents.” (Blueberry Properties, LLC v. Chow (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th
1017, 1020.)
 
Here, Plaintiff seeks to
have the Court order the Clerk of Court to execute the quit claim deeds
transferring title to the following properties from Defendant to Plaintiff,
pursuant to the Court’s 9/26/23 judgment, because Defendant has refused to sign
the quit claim deeds for the properties:
a. 19343 Newhouse Street, Canyon Country, CA 91351;
b. 19438 Delight Street, Canyon Country, CA 91351;
c. Kern County Property, an unimproved lot APN:
345-282-18-00-3; and
d. Lancaster Property, an
unimproved lot APN: 3361-013-009.
 
Defendant argues that the
Court should deny the motion pending the resolution of two pending actions, Los
Angeles County Superior Court Case No. 23CHCV02374 and Los Angeles County
Superior Court Case No. 23STPB11831. These two actions respectively relate to
the partition of real property on which Defendant’s personal residence is
located, and the appointment of a conservator over Plaintiff. (Def.’s Opp.
1:25–2:12.) Defendant further argues that the enforcement of the judgment
should be stayed because he has filed an appeal thereof. (Id. at
2:13–16.)
 
Plaintiff argues in reply that the two pending actions
have not been deemed related to the instant action, and therefore “should not
prevent execution of this Court’s Judgment of September 23, 2023.” (Pl.’s Reply
2:8–9.) Plaintiff further argues that the filing of an appeal does not stay the
enforcement of a judgment for money or real property, because here, no
undertaking was given. (Id. at 3:4–7, citing Code Civ. Proc. §§ 917.1,
917.4.) The Court agrees.
 
Even if the required undertaking was given, “a trial
court shall not have power, without the consent of the adverse party, to stay
the enforcement thereof pursuant to this section for a period which extends for
more than 10 days beyond the last date on which a notice of appeal could be
filed.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 918, subd. (b).) Normally, a notice of appeal must
be filed on the earlier date of either 60 days after service of a Notice of
Entry of Judgment or 180 days after entry of judgment. (Cal. Rules of Ct., r.
8.104(a).)
 
Here, Plaintiff served Defendant with a Notice of
Entry of Judgment on 10/12/23. Therefore, the last date on which Defendant
could file a Notice of Appeal was 12/11/23. Accordingly, the last date until
which the Court could stay the enforcement of the judgment, even if an
undertaking was given, was 12/21/23. Moreover, by virtue of the instant motion,
Plaintiff does not consent to any stay of the enforcement of the judgment. Thus,
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 918, this court lacks the authority,
without Plaintiff’s consent or any undertaking by Defendant, to stay execution
past 12/21/23. And as it is now October 2024, the court has no authority to
stay the execution of the judgment.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion
is granted. Plaintiff is entitled to executed quit claim deeds transferring to
her title of the subject properties. Plaintiff is to file with the Court a
proposed order reflecting the Court’s ruling.
