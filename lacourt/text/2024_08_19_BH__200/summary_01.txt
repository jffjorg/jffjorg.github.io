And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge is addressing four motions: ODS' motions to bifurcate (1) the public policy issue, (2) liability and damages, and (3) 2017 & 2018 accounting issues, and Lucanish's motion for leave to file a second amended cross-complaint.

The judge finds that the public policy issue is not suitable for bifurcation, as it is a factual issue that requires a jury to decide whether Lucanish had a reasonable good faith belief of wrongdoing by ODS. The judge also denies ODS' motions to bifurcate liability and damages, finding that it would not save significant time and could potentially cause prejudice to Lucanish.

The judge also denies Lucanish's motion to file a second amended cross-complaint, finding that it is untimely and would cause prejudice to ODS. The judge concludes that the remaining issue to be decided at trial on the cross-complaint appears to be whether Lucanish had a reasonable good faith belief of wrongdoing by ODS.
