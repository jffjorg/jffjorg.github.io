Here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is regarding a motion to compel further discovery responses and a motion to deem requests for admission admitted against the plaintiff, Vito Anthony Derasmo, by the defendant, House of Hayden, Inc. The defendant seeks to compel further responses to special interrogatories and deem requests for admission admitted due to the plaintiff's failure to timely respond. The plaintiff opposes both motions. The court finds that the plaintiff did provide supplemental responses to the requests for admission, but the fact that the responses were served at all renders the motion to deem requests for admission admitted moot. The court orders the parties to participate in an informal discovery conference (IDC) prior to filing any further motions and continues the hearing on the motions to compel further discovery responses. The court encourages the parties to meet and confer to resolve outstanding issues and provides guidance on the procedures for submitting the tentative ruling and appearing at the hearing.
