And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is regarding a motion to compel a second deposition of Defendant Edward Damas, who is in pro per. The motion was filed by Plaintiff David Williams, who seeks to depose Damas regarding a motor vehicle collision. Damas refused to participate in the deposition, invoking the Fifth Amendment to each and every question. The Court finds that Damas's conduct was unnecessary and obstructive, preventing the deposition from proceeding as it should. Therefore, the Court grants Plaintiff's motion to compel a second deposition. The Court also awards Plaintiff $1,560 in sanctions, including attorney's fees and costs. The parties are ordered to meet and confer to schedule the deposition within 30 days.
