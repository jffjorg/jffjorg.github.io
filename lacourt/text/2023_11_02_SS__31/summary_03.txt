And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting State Farm's motion to intervene in a lawsuit filed by Maria Del Consuelo Bustos Rodriguez against Malachi Rashid Mapps, LLC and Mia Marie Ballantyne. The lawsuit stems from an automobile collision, and State Farm is seeking to intervene to protect its insured's interests. The court finds that State Farm has a sufficient interest to intervene in this action to protect its interests, as it may be exposed to liability under Insurance Code § 11580 for any judgment taken against Defendant Mapps. The court grants State Farm's motion for leave to intervene and orders State Farm to file a separate copy of its complaint-in-intervention and serve it upon all parties within 10 days of the court's order.
