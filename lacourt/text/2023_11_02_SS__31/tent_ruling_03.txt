Background On February 24, 2022, Plaintiff Maria Del Consuelo Bustos Rodriguez (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Malachi Rashid Mapps (“Mapps”) and Mia Marie Ballantyne for damages arising from an automobile collision.  At this time, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (“State Farm”) moves for leave to intervene in the case, contending State Farm has a direct interest in the litigation due to the insurance policy issued to its insured, Defendant Mapps, who has not been located to date. Plaintiff opposes the motion, and State Farm filed a reply.  II.  Legal Standard  “An intervention takes place when a¿nonparty, deemed an intervenor, becomes¿a party to an action or proceeding between other persons¿by doing any of the following:¿(1) Joining a¿plaintiff in claiming what is sought by the complaint.¿¿(2) Uniting with a defendant¿in resisting the claims of¿a¿plaintiff.¿¿(3)¿Demanding¿anything¿adverse¿to both¿a¿plaintiff and a defendant” (CCP¿§¿387(b)(1)-(3).)¿ “A nonparty shall petition the court for leave to intervene by noticed motion or ex¿parte¿application. The petition shall include a copy of the proposed¿complaint¿in intervention or answer in intervention and set¿forth the grounds upon which intervention rests.”¿(CCP¿§ 387(c).)  “The court shall, upon timely application, permit a nonparty to intervene in the action or proceeding if either of the following conditions is satisfied:¿(A) A¿provision of law confers an unconditional right to intervene.¿¿(B) The¿person seeking intervention claims an interest relating to the property or transaction¿that¿is the subject of the action and that person is so situated that the disposition of the action may¿impair or impede that person's ability to protect that interest, unless that person's interest is adequately represented by¿one or more of the¿existing parties.”¿¿(CCP¿§ 387(d)(1)(A)-(B).) “The¿court¿may, upon timely application, permit¿a nonparty¿to intervene¿in the action or proceeding if the person has an interest in the matter in litigation, or in the success of either of the parties, or an interest against both.”¿¿CCP¿§ 387(d)(2).¿  “It is well settled that the intervener's interest in the matter in litigation must be direct, not consequential, and that it must be an interest which is proper to be determined in the action in which intervention is sought.”¿(Simpson Redwood Co. v. State of California¿(1987)¿196 Cal.App.3d 1192, 1199-1200.) Furthermore, “the interest which entitles a party to intervene must be an interest in the matter in litigation in the suit as¿originally¿brought, and of such a present, direct and immediate character that the intervener will either gain or lose by the direct effect of the judgment. [Citations.] An intervener cannot be permitted to broaden the scope or function of such special proceeding by urging claims or contentions which have their proper forum elsewhere.”¿(People v. Brophy¿(1942)¿49 Cal.App.2d 15, 34-35 (emphasis in original).)¿¿  The court permits intervention when the¿following factors are met: (1) the proper procedures have been followed; (2) the nonparty has a direct and immediate interest in the action; (3) the intervention will not enlarge the issues in the litigation; and (4) the reasons for the intervention outweigh any opposition by the parties presently in the action.¿ (Siena Court Homeowners¿Ass’n¿v. Green Valley Corp.¿(2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1416, 1428.)¿ CCP¿§ 387 should be liberally construed in favor of intervention.¿(Simpson Redwood Co. v. State of California¿(1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 1192, 1200.).    III.  Discussion  Under California law, an insurance carrier who is not a party to an action can intervene on behalf of its insured when the insurance carrier could be subject to a subsequent action under Insurance¿Code¿section¿11580.¿ (See¿Reliance Ins. Co. v. Superior Court¿(2000) 84 Cal.App.4th¿383, 386,¿(“An insurer’s right to intervene in an action against the insured, for personal injury or property damages, arises as a result of Ins. Code section 11580.”).)¿¿“Section 11580 provides that a judgment creditor may proceed directly against any liability insurance covering the¿defendant, and¿obtain satisfaction of the judgment up to the amount of the policy limits.¿¿Thus, where the insurer may be subject to a direct action under Insurance Code section 11580 by a judgment creditor who has or will obtain a default judgment in a¿third party¿action against the insured, intervention is¿appropriate.”¿ (Id.;¿see also¿Jade K. v.¿Viguri¿(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 1459, 1468¿(permitting an insurer to intervene in lawsuit to litigate liability and damage issues).)¿¿“‘Intervention may . . . be allowed in the insurance context, where third party claimants are involved, when the insurer is allowed to take over in litigation if its insured is not defending an action, to avoid harm to the insurer.’”¿ (Western Heritage Ins. Co. v. Superior Court¿(2011)¿199 Cal.App.4th 1196, 1205 (quoting¿Royal Indemnity Co. v. United Enterprises, Inc.¿(2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 194, 206).)¿ State Farm declares that it issued the applicable automobile policy to Defendant Mapps and that, despite diligent efforts to reach Defendant Mapps, defense counsel has been unable to contact Defendant Mapps. State Farm avers Defendant Mapps did not cooperate with both prior defense counsel and current defense counsel, and that he has not responded to discovery or appeared for his deposition. State Farm argues it is entitled to intervene to protect its insured’s interests, and that as Defendant Mapps liability insurer, State Farm has interest in the property that is the subject of this litigation, namely the insurance policy from which Plaintiff seeks damages arising from the automobile incident.  Plaintiff, in opposition, contends State Farm has not been diligent in seeking leave to intervene because it took Defendant over four months to bring the instant motion. Plaintiff argues State Farm has not provided any declaration from its investigator or defense counsel demonstrating efforts to locate Defendant Mapps. Plaintiff also contends that State Farm, as an insurer, acted in bad faith by failing to offer the policy limits, and that Plaintiff will be prejudiced if intervention is granted because it may affect the open policy. In reply, State Farm argues it filed the motion on July 28, 2023, and the first available date for the Court to hear the motion was not for another four months thereafter. State Farm contends it should not be punished for the Court’s limited resources.   The Court finds no undue delay in filing the motion, and Plaintiff’s conclusory contention of potential prejudice to be unavailing. Further, the Court finds that State Farm may be exposed to liability pursuant to Insurance Code § 11580 for any judgment taken against Defendant Mapps.¿ State Farm thus has a sufficient interest to intervene in this action to protect its interests. Accordingly, State Farm’s motion or leave to intervene is GRANTED. State Farm is ordered to file a separate copy of its complaint-in-intervention and serve upon all parties a copy of the same within ten (10) days of the Court’s order.    State Farm is ordered to give notice and to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within five days.  PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 1st day of November 2023      Hon.
