Legal
Standard
 
Relief under section 473(b) is either discretionary
or mandatory. A motion for mandatory relief must be made no more than six
months after entry of judgment and be accompanied by an attorney’s sworn
affidavit attesting to the attorney’s “mistake, inadvertence, surprise or
neglect.” (CCP § 473(b).) The attorney affidavit of fault must contain a
“straight forward admission of fault.” (State Farm Fire & Casualty Co.
v. Pietak (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 600, 610.) But it need not contain an
explanation of the reasons for the attorney’s mistake, inadvertence surprise or
neglect. (Martin Potts &
Assocs., Inc. v. Corsair, LLC (2016)
244 Cal.App.4th 432, 438-441.)
Relief must be
granted “unless the court finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact
caused by the attorney's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.” (Ibid.) If mandatory relief is
granted, the court must “direct
the attorney to pay reasonable compensatory legal fees and costs” to the
opposing counsel or parties. (CCP § 473(b).)
 
Where a party cannot obtain an attorney affidavit of
fault, the party may seek discretionary relief under section 473(b) due to “mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” (CCP § 473(b).) A motion for
discretionary relief must be made “within a reasonable time but in no instance
exceeding six months after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was
taken.” (Id.) If discretionary relief is granted, the court may in its
discretion order the moving party to pay the costs, including attorney fees,
incurred in obtaining the default. (Rogalski v. Nabers Cadillac (1992)
11 Cal.App.4th 816, 823; Vanderkous v. Conley (2010) 188
Cal.App.4th 111, 118-119.) If the motion for discretionary relief is granted, the
court may order the offending attorney to pay monetary sanctions up to $1,000
to opposing parties, or up to $1,000 to the State Bar Client Security Fund, or
“[g]rant other relief as is appropriate.” (CCP § 473(c)(1)(A), (B), (C).)
 
A motion for relief under section 473(b) “shall be
accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted. . .” (CCP § 473(b).)
However, this requirement is
not jurisdictional; substantial compliance may suffice. (Carmel, Ltd. v. Tavoussi (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 393, 403
[finding substantial compliance where counsel offered proposed answer at
motion hearing rather than serving it with moving papers].) 
 
Analysis
 
Defendant Heritage Escrow Company
moves for an order: (1) vacating and setting aside the dismissal without
prejudice of Heritage’s, “Cross-Complaint for Express Contractual Indemnity,”
against Caroline Kreling, Darren Cobrea, John Cobrea and Elevated Equities, a
Nevada limited liability company entered on October 27, 2023; (2) reinstating
the cross-complaint of the Heritage Escrow Company; and (3) reinstating the
defaults entered against cross-defendants Darren Cobrea, John Cobrea and
Elevated Equities, LLC, a Nevada Limited Liability Company on the
Cross-Complaint of the Heritage Escrow Company on
April 9 and 12, 2021.
 
As a result of a settlement,
Heritage agreed to dismiss Kreling from their cross-complaint without
prejudice. Counsel for Heritage mistakenly prepared form CIV-110 by identifying
the cross-complaint, but failing to limit the dismissal without prejudice to
Kreling only. (Ross Decl., ¶ 7; see RJN Ex. 1.) Notably, the proof of service
on the Request for Dismissal states “as to Caroline Kreling on the
Cross-Complaint of Heritage”. (Id.) On October 31, 2023, counsel discovered his
mistake. (¶ 10.) Heritage promptly moved for relief on November 8, 2023.
 
The court finds that the above
record shows good cause for mandatory and discretionary relief. (CCP § 473(b).)

 
Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED.
