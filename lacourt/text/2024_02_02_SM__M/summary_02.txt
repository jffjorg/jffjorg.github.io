And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to declare James Hunter a vexatious litigant and require him to post a $25,000.00 security to cover expected attorneys' fees. The motion is brought by Darren Burris and Sierra Fino, who are protected persons under a restraining order issued in case 22SMR00115. The judge finds that while Hunter commenced actions while the restraining order was in place, this showing alone is insufficient to declare him a vexatious litigant. The judge also finds that the instant actions have not been determined to be meritless, and that the settlement agreement entered into under case no. 22SMCV01181 does not demonstrate that the actions are without merit. The judge is reluctant to litigate the issue of the settlement agreement's validity, especially when other concurrent actions exist. Therefore, the judge denies the motion to declare Hunter a vexatious litigant.
