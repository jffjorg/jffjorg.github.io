And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to vacate the dismissal without prejudice of Heritage Escrow Company's cross-complaint against Caroline Kreling, Darren Cobrea, John Cobrea, and Elevated Equities, LLC. The dismissal was caused by counsel's mistake in preparing the form CIV-110, which failed to limit the dismissal without prejudice to Kreling only. The court finds that the record shows good cause for mandatory and discretionary relief under CCP ยง 473(b). As a result, the motion is granted, and the dismissal without prejudice is vacated.
