And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by defendants Darren Burris and Sierra Fino to declare plaintiff James Hunter a vexatious litigant and require him to post a $25,000.00 security bond. The defendants argue that Hunter is a vexatious litigant because he is the named defendant in a restraining order issued in case 22SMR00115, which designates Fino and Burris as protected persons. However, the judge finds that this showing alone is insufficient as a matter of law. Under section 391(b)(5) of the California Code of Civil Procedure, the instant actions need to have been "determined to be meritless" and "caused the person protected by the order to be harassed or intimidated." The judge notes that the action has not been determined to be meritless, and the defendants have not shown that they were harassed or intimidated by the instant suits.

Additionally, the judge finds that the defendants have not demonstrated that Hunter repeatedly filed unmeritorious motions, pleadings, or other papers that were frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay. The judge also notes that the defendants' contention that the instant actions are without merit because they are embraced by a settlement agreement entered into in case 22SMCV01181 is not certain, as there has been no determination that the settlement agreement was valid or procured by fraud.

Based on these findings, the judge denies the defendants' motions.
