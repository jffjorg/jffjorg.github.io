```

And here is the English text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has ruled that the motion for good faith settlement filed by defendant Mario Saldivar is granted. The motion was contested by defendant Westlake Services LLC, who argued that the settlement was made in bad faith. However, the court finds that Saldivar has presented sufficient evidence demonstrating that the settlement was made in good faith under the Tech-Bilt factors. The court notes that Saldivar's proportionate liability would be minimal, and that he should pay less in settlement than he would if he were found liable after a trial. The court also finds that Westlake has failed to show that the settlement was made in bad faith, as it relies solely on allegations in the complaint and does not provide any substantive grounds for a high recovery by the plaintiff. Therefore, the court grants the motion and determines that the settlement was made in good faith.
