And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by plaintiff Wayne Lewis to correct the clerk's error in filing his complaint and summons. The plaintiff claims that he timely filed the documents on February 16, 2024, but the clerk's office rejected them due to errors. The plaintiff's counsel corrected the errors and refiled the documents multiple times, but the clerk's office continued to reject them until March 4, 2024. The plaintiff notes that this delay caused the statute of limitations to expire prior to acceptance. The court agrees that for statute of limitations purposes, the filing of the action occurred on February 22, 2024, and grants the motion for a nunc pro tunc order stating the correct filing date.
