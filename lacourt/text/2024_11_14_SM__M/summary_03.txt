And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Montcho v. UCLA Medical Center (Case No. 23SMCV04736). The Defendant, The Regents of the University of California, moves to compel the Plaintiff, Louis Montcho, to respond to a Request for Production of Documents, Set One. The Defendant served the Plaintiff with the request on August 2, 2024, and sent a follow-up correspondence on September 12, 2024, advising the Plaintiff of the past-due discovery responses and providing an additional 7 days to respond. Despite this, the Plaintiff failed to respond. The Judge has granted the motion to compel and ordered the Plaintiff to provide verified responses within 10 days, without objection. This ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2031.010 and 2031.300, which provide that a party must seek an order compelling a response if there has been no timely response to a discovery demand, and that failure to timely respond waives all objections, including privilege and work product.
