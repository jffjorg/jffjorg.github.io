  Case Number:  23SMCV02880    Hearing Date:   November 14, 2024    Dept:  M CASE NAME:           Fuller, et
al., v. General Motors LLC, et al.
CASE NO.:                23SMCV02880
MOTION:                  Motion
to Compel Deposition 
HEARING DATE:   11/14/2024
 
Legal
Standard
 
Service of a proper deposition notice obligates a party or “party-affiliated”
witness (officer, director, managing agent or employee of party) to attend and
testify, as well as produce any document, electronically stored information, or
tangible thing for inspection and copying. (CCP § 2025.280(a).) If, after service
of a deposition notice, a party deponent fails to appear, testify, or produce
documents or tangible things for inspection without having served a valid
objection under CCP § 2025.410, the deposing party may move for an order
compelling attendance, testimony, and production. (CCP § 2025.450(a).) The
motion must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration, or, when a party
deponent fails to attend the deposition, the motion must also be accompanied by
a declaration stating that the moving party has contacted the party deponent to
inquire about the nonappearance. (CCP § 2025.450(b)(2).) If the deposition
notice included a request for production of documents, the motion to compel
attendance must also show good cause to justify the production. (CCP § 2025.450(b)(1).) 
  
A motion to compel production of documents described in a
deposition notice must be accompanied by a showing of good cause. (CCP §
2025.450(b)(1).) In other words, the moving party must provide declarations
containing specific facts justifying inspection of the documents described in
the notice. Courts liberally construe good cause in favor of discovery where
facts show the documents are necessary for trial preparation. 
 
The motion to compel must be “made no later than 60 days
after the completion of the record of the deposition.” (CCP § 2025.480(b).) 
 
Analysis
 
Plaintiffs Darren E. Fuller and
Gianni M. Black move to compel Defendant General Motors LLC’s person most
knowledgeable (PMK) deposition pertaining to Examination 1-3, 6-24, 26-28, 30,
and 33, and responses and production of documents pursuant to Plaintiffs’
associated Request for Production of Documents, numbers 1-17.
 
            Plaintiffs’
claims arise from their purchase of a 2021 Cadillac Escalade. Plaintiffs allege
that GM was unable to repair the vehicle within reasonable number of attempts,
and refused to repurchase Plaintiffs’ vehicle despite its knowledge that
Plaintiffs’ vehicle suffers from serious electrical system defects. (Yowarski
Decl., ¶¶ 6-7, Ex. 1.)  Plaintiffs served
a notice of deposition of Defendant GM’s PMK and requested production of
documents on October 19, 2023, with the deposition to take place on November 7,
2023. (Id., ¶ 16., Ex. 3.) Defendant did not serve any objections regarding
Plaintiffs’ Notice of PMK Deposition and did not provide a PMK witness as
noticed. (Id. ¶ 17.) On November 7, 2023, Plaintiffs served an Amended
Deposition Notice of GM’s PMK for November 21, 2023. (Id. ¶ 18., Ex. 4.) GM
again failed to serve any objections and did not provide a PMK witness as
noticed. (Id. ¶ 19.)
 
The motion is untimely. The
deposition record was completed on November 21, 2023, the date the operative
notice set for the deposition. Plaintiff waited almost a year before attempting
to compel the deposition, which is beyond 60 days after the completion of the record.
Any objections posed by GM in July 2024 would not revive this motion. The meet
and confer efforts in July 2024 did not pertain to this action since the
correspondence does not show any reference to Plaintiffs Fuller and Black, or
this case number. (See Yowarski Decl., ¶¶ 20-25, Exs. 5-7.) 
 
As such, the motion is DENIED.
