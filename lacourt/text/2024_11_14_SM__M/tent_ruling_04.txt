ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiff Wayne Lewis moves for an
order nunc pro tunc to correct the Clerk of the Court’s error during the filing
of Plaintiff’s Complaint, Summons and Civil Case Cover Sheet. Plaintiff
requests that the court correct the incorrect filing date of March 4, 2024, to
reflect the date of February 16, 2024.
 
Plaintiff explains that on February
16, 2024, he timely electronically transmitted the complaint. (Jackman Decl., Ex.
3.) Plaintiffs’ counsel experienced extreme difficulty while attempting to load
the documents including the complaint, summons, and the civil cover sheet with
an addendum as additional documents. The system refused to upload the two
supporting documents, and as such, the complaint was uploaded by itself. The
Clerk rejected the filing on February 20, 2024, indicating that additional
documents were needed to complete the filing. Ten minutes later, Plaintiff’s
counsel successfully filed the entire series of required documents. (Ex. 4.) The
documents were rejected by the clerk’s office because the names in the Case
Information didn’t match the names in the complaint. On February 22, 2024, Plaintiff’s
counsel corrected the errors and refiled the entire series of documents
required. (Ex. 5). Again, the documents were rejected by the clerk’s office
because more than one box had been checked as for the type of action on the
civil case addendum sheet. (Ex. 6.) On February 23, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel
corrected the errors and refiled the entire series of documents. (Ex. 7.) On
February 27, 2024, the documents were rejected by the clerk’s office because
more than one box had been checked as for the type of action on the civil case
addendum sheet. (Ex. 8.) On March 2, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel again attempted
to correct the errors and refiled the entire series of documents. (Ex. 9.) The documents
were finally accepted by the clerk’s office on March 4, 2024. (Ex. 10.) Plaintiff
notes that the clerk’s refusal to accept the filings delayed the filings by
twelve days, unfortunately causing the statute of limitations to expire prior
to acceptance. 
 
The Court concurs that for statute
of limitations purposes, the filing of this action occurred on February 22,
2024, and that Plaintiff is entitled to nunc pro tunc order stating as such. Where
the clerk rejects a filing for
immaterial variance with court rules, it would be error to deny a nunc pro tunc
order to reflect the true filing date and deprive a litigant of an otherwise
timely claim. (Rojas v. Cutsforth (1998)
67 Cal.App.4th 774, 777–778; Carlson
v. State of California Department of Fish & Game (1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 1268; Mito v. Temple
Recycling Center Corp. (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 276.) Accordingly, the
motion is GRANTED.
