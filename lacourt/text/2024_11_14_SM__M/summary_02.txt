And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion of Counsel Dariush Adli, Vernon Nelson, and ADLI Law Group PC to be relieved as counsel of record for Defendants Gaurav Srivastava, Birdsong Central LLC, and Sharan Srivastava. The motion is granted because the client was served by mail at his last known address, which was confirmed within the past 30 days by email, and trial is not set. The court does not find that the client will be prejudiced by the withdrawal.
