And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to compel the deposition of General Motors LLC's Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK) and the production of documents. The motion is untimely, as the deposition record was completed on November 21, 2023, and the motion was filed almost a year later. The judge notes that any objections posed by General Motors in July 2024 would not revive this motion. The meet and confer efforts in July 2024 did not pertain to this action, as the correspondence did not reference the plaintiffs, Darren E. Fuller and Gianni M. Black, or this case number.
