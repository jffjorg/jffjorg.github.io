And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a slip-and-fall incident that occurred on January 9, 2022, at a Trader Joe's store in Santa Ana, California. The plaintiff, Bradley Erwin, claims that the defendants, including Trader Joe's, were negligent in maintaining the premises and that he suffered serious injuries as a result of the incident.

The defendants, including Trader Joe's, filed a demurrer to the complaint, arguing that it failed to state a cause of action. The plaintiff filed an opposition and the defendants filed a reply.

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the first and second causes of action, which are for premises liability and general negligence, respectively. The judge has also sustained the demurrer for uncertainty, which means that the complaint is unclear and does not specifically identify which defendants are responsible for the alleged wrongful conduct.

The judge has given the plaintiff 20 days to file a first amended complaint that addresses the issues raised in the demurrer.
