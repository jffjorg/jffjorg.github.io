 Case Number:  24AHCV00046    Hearing Date:   September 26, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER SUSTAINING  DEFENDANT TRADER JOE’S DEMURRER TO COMPLAINT, WITH LEAVE TO AMEND. I.         INTRODUCTION             This action  arises out of an alleged slip-and-fall incident involving Plaintiff Bradley  Erwin ("Plaintiff") that occurred on January 9, 2022, at 3329 South  Bristol Street in Santa Ana, California. Plaintiff alleges that, while lawfully  on the premises, he slipped and fell on an unknown liquid substance. Plaintiff  claims that Trader Joe’s, Excel Realty Partners, Excel Realty Partners, L.P.,  and Does 1 through 100 (collectively, "Defendants") negligently  owned, maintained, and operated the premises. As a result of the fall, Plaintiff  asserts that he sustained serious injuries and required medical treatment. On  January 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed this lawsuit, asserting causes of action for  (1) premises liability and (2) general negligence.   PROCEDURAL HISTORY On January 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed  the Complaint. On May 30, 2024, Defendants, specifically, Trader Joe’s  (“Defendant Trader Joe’s”) filed a Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint. On September 11, 2024, Plaintiff  filed an Opposition to Defendant Trader Joe’s Demurrer, and on September 19,  2024, Defendant Trader Joe’s filed a Reply to Plaintiff’s Opposition. Timeliness of the Demurrer Plaintiff’s counsel alleges that  Defendant Trader Joe’s did not timely file its demurrer, asserting that the  defense had 30 days from service to respond to the complaint. (Renge Decl.,  Exhibit A) Plaintiff served Defendant Trader Joe’s via personal  service on April 2, 2024. Under California Code of Civil Procedure section  412.20(a)(3), after personal service of a summons and complaint, a defendant  must file a responsive pleading within 30 days. Therefore, the original  deadline for Defendant to respond was May 2, 2024. However, on May 1, 2024,  Defendant's counsel requested a thirty-day extension to file a responsive  pleading, which Plaintiff’s counsel granted. (Renge Decl., Exhibit B) As a  result, Defendant’s filing of the demurrer on May 30, 2024, was timely and  within the extended deadline agreed upon by both parties. Meet and Confer Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure  section 430.41, subdivision (a), the demurring party is required to meet and  confer with the party who filed the pleading at least five days before the  responsive pleading is due. This must occur in person, telephone or by video  conference with the aim of resolving any objections raised in the demurrer.  Additionally, the demurring party must file and serve a declaration detailing  the meet and confer efforts. It should be noted, however, that the failure to  meet and confer is not itself grounds for sustaining or overruling a demurrer,  or granting or denying a motion to strike. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, subd.  (a)(4), 435.5, subd. (a)(4).) In this instance, the Court finds  that Defendant Trader Joe's sufficiently complied with the meet-and-confer  requirements. Defense counsel for Trader Joe's first reached out via email on  May 1, 2024, requesting potential dates and times for a meet and confer,  specifically stating, "Please let us know a few dates/times you are  available to discuss." (Renge Decl., ¶2, Exhibit B) On May 17, 2024,  defense counsel sent another letter via email, reiterating that the letter  constituted a good faith effort to meet and confer and again requesting,  "Please provide me with available dates so that we can complete our  telephonic meet and confer requirements." (Mathis Decl., ¶3, Exhibit A)  Despite these attempts, Plaintiff’s counsel responded on May 20, 2024, without  providing any specific dates or times to conduct a telephonic meet and confer.  (Renge Decl., Exhibit C) Accordingly, the Court finds that  the defense has made reasonable and sufficient efforts to comply with the  meet-and-confer obligations under Code of Civil Procedure sections 430.41 and  435.5. MOVING PARTY’S ARGUMENT Defendant Trader Joe’s demurs to  the causes of action for (1) premises liability and (2) general negligence,  arguing that Plaintiff fails to state sufficient facts to support either cause  of action. Additionally, Defendant Trader Joe’s contends that Plaintiff’s  complaint is uncertain regarding the specific allegations against each  defendant. II.        LEGAL STANDARD A demurrer tests the legal  sufficiency of a complaint. Donabedian v.  Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994. A plaintiff’s allegations  must be accepted as true for purposes of demurrer, no matter how “improbable”  they are. (Del E. Webb Corp. v.  Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604 (Del E. Webb).) Allegations need not be  accepted as true if they are contradicted by judicially noticeable facts. (Cansino v. Bank of America (2014) 224  Cal.App.4th 1462, 1474.)  Pleadings are to be broadly  construed (Code Civ. Proc., § 452) and demurrers are to be overruled where the  facts are sufficient to state any cause of action. (Quelimane Co. v. Stewart  Title Guaranty Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 38.) Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (f)  provides for a demurrer where a pleading is uncertain. Demurrers for  uncertainty are disfavored and are only sustained where a pleading is so incomprehensible  a defendant cannot reasonably respond. (A.J. Fistes v. GDL Best Contractors,  Inc. (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 677, 695; Khoury v. Maly’s of California (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)  III.      ANALYSIS A.     General Demurrer – Failure to State Facts  Sufficient to Constitute a Cause of Action A general demurrer may be taken to  a complaint where “[t]he pleading does not state facts sufficient to constitute  a cause of action.” (Code  Civ. Proc., §  430.10, subd. (e).) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations  liberally and in context.¿ (Wilson v. Transit Authority of City of  Sacramento (1962) 199 Cal.App.2d 716, 720-21.)¿ First cause of action: Premise Liability Defendant Trader Joe’s demurs to  the first cause of action for premises liability, arguing that Plaintiff has  failed to plead sufficient facts to establish the necessary elements for  premises liability against a landowner. (Demurrer, pp. 8-10). The elements of a cause of action  for premises liability mirror those for negligence: duty, breach, causation,  and damages. (Castellon v. U.S. Bancorp (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 994, 998;  Civ. Code, § 1714, subd. (a).) To plead a cause of action for premises  liability, Plaintiff must allege that Defendant Trader Joe’s had actual or  constructive knowledge of the dangerous condition, or that they could have  discovered the condition through the exercise of ordinary care. (See Ortega  v. Kmart Corp. (2001) 26 Cal.4th 1200, 1206). Constructive knowledge can be  imputed if the dangerous condition existed for a sufficient period of time to  be discovered by a reasonably prudent person. (Id. at p. 1207). “A condition is dangerous if it  creates a substantial risk of injury when foreseeable users use the property  with due care.” (Huffman v. City of Poway (2000) 84 Cal.App.4th  975, 991 (citing Gov. Code, § 830, subd. (a).) “A condition is not  dangerous if the risk of injury created by the condition is so minor, trivial  or insignificant that it arises only when foreseeable users do not use due  care.” (Id., citing Gov. Code, § 830.2.) “Whether a given set of facts  and circumstances creates a dangerous condition is usually a question of fact.”  (Ibid.) “The issue of a dangerous condition becomes a question of  law only where reasonable minds can come to only one conclusion.” (Ibid.) “Whether  the condition of property posed a substantial risk of injury to foreseeable  users exercising due care is an objective standard and is measured by the risk  posed to an ordinary foreseeable user.” (Id. at p. 992.) In this case, the Court finds that  Plaintiff’s allegations are conclusory and fail to plead sufficient facts to  meet the required elements of a premises liability claim. Duty: Plaintiff alleges that Defendants  owed him a duty to maintain the premises in a safe condition, claiming that  "Defendants breached their duty to Plaintiff by failing to address,  alleviate, remove and/or remedy the dangerous condition." (Compl. p.4).  The Court finds that this allegation lacks specificity regarding how Defendant  Trader Joe’s failed to uphold its duty. Plaintiff has not provided facts  regarding the time and manner in which he was on the premises, whether he was  shopping at Trader Joe’s, or if the incident occurred during closed hours. Plaintiff  also fails to allege where on the premises the incident occurred, e.g. inside  the store, the parking lot, the loading dock, etc.  The absence of these factual details renders  the claim insufficient to support the contention that Defendant Trader Joe’s  owed a duty of care.   Breach: Plaintiff alleges that Defendants  failed to remove or remedy the dangerous condition. Specifically, Plaintiff  claims that "Defendants breached their duty to Plaintiff by failing to  address, alleviate, remove and/or remedy the dangerous condition."  (Compl., p. 4.) The Court finds that while the statement that Defendants  breached their duty is a legal conclusion, the demurrer admits the truth of all  material, ultimate facts alleged in the complaint. As such, Plaintiff is not  required to plead detailed evidentiary facts at this stage but must only allege  ultimate facts sufficient to apprise Defendants of the nature of the claim.  Causation: While Plaintiff alleges that the  breach of duty caused severe injuries, the complaint does not include  sufficient factual allegations to establish a causal link between Defendant  Trader Joe’s actions (or inaction) and the incident. Plaintiff’s general statement  that “this caused Plaintiff to suffer severe injuries” (Compl. p. 4) is  insufficient to demonstrate how Defendant’s conduct led to the harm suffered. Damages: Plaintiff pleads that he received  "reasonable and necessary medical care and treatment" as a result of  the fall (Compl. p. 4). The Court finds that the damages were sufficiently  pled. Dangerous Condition - Premise Liability Finally, Plaintiff describes the  dangerous condition as an “unknown liquid substance” (Compl. p. 4). While this  may suggest a potentially hazardous condition, the Court finds that Plaintiff  has not provided sufficient details about the nature of the substance, how long  it was present, or whether Trader Joe’s knew or should have known of its  existence. A premises liability claim requires more than a conclusory statement  about a dangerous condition; Plaintiff must provide facts indicating that the  condition posed a substantial risk of harm to foreseeable users exercising due  care. (Huffman v. City of Poway (2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 975, 991.)   Second cause of action: General Negligence Defendant Trader Joe’s demurs to  the second cause of action for general negligence, arguing that Plaintiff has  failed to plead sufficient facts to establish the necessary elements of  negligence. (Demurrer, pp. 11-13). To state a claim for negligence,  Plaintiff must allege the following elements: (1) the existence of a legal duty  of care, (2) breach of that duty, and (3) proximate cause resulting in an  injury. (McIntyre v. Colonies-Pacific, LLC (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 664,  671). Here, Plaintiff alleges that  "Defendants so negligently owned, operated, maintained, entrusted, and/or  controlled the subject premises." (Compl. p. 5). The Court finds that this  allegation is conclusory. Merely stating that Defendants acted negligently does  not provide sufficient factual detail to support the claim. There are no  specific facts presented regarding how Trader Joe’s conduct constituted  negligence or how Defendants' actions led to the alleged harm. Additionally,  Plaintiff asserts that "Defendants owed a legal duty, and Defendants  breached their duty." (Compl. p. 5). Again, the Court finds that this  language is conclusory and lacks sufficient factual support. Plaintiff has not  adequately explained how the duty was breached or what specific actions or  inactions by Defendant Trader Joe’s amounted to a breach of the duty of care. Plaintiff also claims that  "Defendants were subject to and violated ADA, California Health &  Safety Codes" (Compl. p.5), and that "these violations legally caused  Plaintiff's damages" (Compl. p. 4). The Court finds that these allegations  are similarly conclusory and do not provide sufficient factual details.  Plaintiff fails to specify which provisions of the ADA or Health & Safety  Codes were allegedly violated, how these violations occurred, or how they  directly caused Plaintiff’s injuries. In conclusion, the Court finds that  Plaintiff has not sufficiently plead the elements required to support a claim  for general negligence. The allegations are too conclusory and lack the  necessary factual specificity to establish that Defendant Trader Joe’s owed and  breached a duty of care, or that their conduct proximately caused Plaintiff’s  injuries. Thus, because Plaintiff fails to  allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for general negligence,  the Court SUSTAINS the demurrer to the first two causes of action with leave to  amend.    B.     Special Demurrer - Uncertainty             A defendant  may demur to a complaint on the grounds that the pleading is “uncertain.” (Code  Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (f).) Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10,  subdivision (f), provides that a pleading is uncertain if it is ambiguous or  unintelligible. (Ibid.) A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed  because ambiguities can be clarified through modern discovery procedures. (Khoury  v. Maly’s of Cal., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) A demurrer for  uncertainty will be sustained only where the complaint is so vague that the  defendant cannot reasonably respond—that is, they cannot reasonably determine  what issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are directed  against them.  Additionally, the objection of  uncertainty does not pertain to a failure to allege sufficient facts. (Brea  v. McGlashan (1934) 3 Cal.App.2d 454, 459.) It pertains instead to doubt  about what the pleader means by the facts alleged. (Ibid.) A demurrer  should not be sustained where the allegations of the complaint are sufficiently  clear to apprise the defendant of the issues they must meet. (People v. Lim  (1941) 18 Cal.2d 872, 882.) In this case, Defendant Trader  Joe’s alleges that Plaintiff’s complaint is uncertain because it fails to  specify which defendants are responsible for the alleged wrongful conduct.  Plaintiff refers collectively to “Defendants,” which include Trader Joe’s,  Excel Realty Partners, Excel Realty Partners, L.P., and Does 1 through 100. By  not distinguishing between the individual defendants, Plaintiff fails to  provide clear factual allegations identifying the specific actions or inactions  attributable to each defendant. Defendant Trader Joe’s argues that  Plaintiff’s use of the term “Defendants” without specificity hinders their  ability to respond adequately to the complaint, and that it prejudices their  defense. (Demurrer, p. 19.) Although the Court agrees that grouping all  defendants together without specifying individual roles makes it challenging  for Defendants to ascertain responsibility, Defendant Trader Joe’s can still  reasonably determine whether the premises in question are theirs. The Court  finds that this lack of specificity does not severely prejudice Defendant  Trader Joe’s, and the issue can be remedied by an amendment to the complaint. Accordingly, the special demurrer  for uncertainty is SUSTAINED with leave to amend. IV.       ORDER             The Court  SUSTAINS the demurrer as to first and second causes of action, as well as the  demurrer for uncertainty with leave to amend.  Plaintiff to file his first amended complaint within 20 days of this ruling.   Defendant is to give notice.                      Dated: September 26, 2024                                                                              JARED D.
