Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion to set aside the judgment of dismissal. The plaintiff, Brison Hardin, had filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) against the County of Los Angeles, alleging FEHA discrimination, FEHA retaliation, and FEHA failure to prevent discrimination and retaliation. However, the Court sustained the County's demurrer to the FAC because the plaintiff had not pleaded an adverse employment action. The plaintiff's former counsel, Nathalie Meza Contreras, failed to appear at the demurrer hearing due to technical difficulties, which resulted in the dismissal of the case. The former counsel has submitted an affidavit of attorney fault, stating that she would have presented arguments at the hearing supporting an amended pleading. The Court finds that the dismissal was caused by the former counsel's mistake and grants the motion to set aside the judgment. The Court directs the former counsel to pay the defendant $1,500 in fees and costs. The plaintiff is required to file an amended pleading within 10 days.
