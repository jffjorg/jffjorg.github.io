Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Maria Aguayo's motion for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint (SAC). The proposed SAC adds claims for disability discrimination, failure to engage in the interactive process, failure to provide reasonable accommodation, failure to provide supplemental sick leave, and retaliation for use of sick leave. The Judge finds that the proposed SAC is deemed filed and served as of the date of the hearing. The Judge also declines the defendant's request to continue the trial date. The Judge's ruling is based on the legal standard that courts must apply a policy of great liberality in permitting amendments to the complaint when no prejudice is shown to the adverse party.
