The Final Status Conference is set for March 18, 2025. Trial
is set for April 1, 2025.
Legal Standard
“The court
may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow a
party to amend any pleading…” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1); and see §
576 [“Any judge, at any time before
or after commencement of trial, in the furtherance of justice, and upon such
terms as may be proper, may allow the amendment of any pleading or pretrial
conference order”].)
“[T]he trial court has wide discretion in allowing the
amendment of any pleading.” (Bedolla v.
Logan & Frazer (1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 118, 135.) “[I]t is irrelevant that
new legal theories are introduced as long as the proposed amendments relate to
the same general set of facts.” (Kittredge
Sports Co. v. Superior Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1048 [quotation
marks and citation omitted].) “[E]ven if the proposed legal theory is a novel
one, the preferable practice would be to permit the amendment and allow the
parties to test its legal sufficiency by demurrer,
motion for judgment on the pleadings or other appropriate proceedings.” (Id. [quotation marks and citation
omitted].) With that said, “the failure of a proposed amendment to state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action or defense may support an order
denying a motion to amend.” (California Casualty Gen. Ins. Co. v. Superior
Court (1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 274, 280, disapproved of on other grounds in Kransco
v. American Empire Surplus Lines Ins. Co. (2000) 23 Cal.4th 390)
Courts must apply a policy of great liberality in permitting
amendments to the complaint at any stage of the proceedings, up to and
including trial, when no prejudice is shown to the adverse party. (Atkinson v. Elk Corp. (2003) 109
Cal.App.4th 739, 761.) However, “even if a good amendment is proposed in proper
form, unwarranted delay in presenting it may—of itself—be a valid reason for
denial    . . . denial may rest upon the element of lack of diligence in offering
the amendment after knowledge of the facts, or the effect of the delay on the
adverse party.” (Roemer v. Retail Credit
Co. (1975) 44 Cal.App.3d 926, 940.)
“A motion to amend a pleading before trial must: (1) Include
a copy of the proposed amendment or amended pleading, which must be serially
numbered to differentiate it from previous pleadings or amendments; (2) State
what allegations in the previous pleading are proposed to be deleted, if any,
and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the deleted allegations are
located; and (3) State what allegations are proposed to be added to the
previous pleading, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the
additional allegations are located.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(a).)
Additionally, “[a] separate declaration must accompany the
motion and must specify: (1) The effect of the amendment; (2) Why the amendment
is necessary and proper; (3) When the facts giving rise to the amended
allegations were discovered; and (4) The reasons why the request for amendment
was not made earlier.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(b).)
Discussion
Plaintiff moves the
court, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 473, for leave to file her
proposed Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”)
Plaintiff
represents that the proposed SAC adds claims for disability discrimination in
violation of Government Code § 12940(a), failure to engage in the interactive
process in violation of Government Code § 12940(n), failure to provide
reasonable accommodation in violation of Government Code Section 12940(m),
failure to provide supplemental sick leave in violation of Labor Code Section
248.6, and retaliation for use of sick leave in violation of Labor Code
Sections 246.5, 233 and 234. (Motion, 5:10-15).
The motion reflects sufficient compliance with California
Rules of Court rule 3.1324, subdivisions (a) and (b). Plaintiff has provided
the court with “clean” and “redline” versions of the proposed SAC and has
identified the proposed amendments on pages 7 and 8 of the motion.
Plaintiff’s counsel Mazen Khatib (“Khatib”) represents that
Plaintiff propounded written discovery requests to District on December 28, 2023
(Khatib Decl., ¶ 3); that District’s 
discovery responses, provided March 5, 2024, cited “concerns with
[Plaintiff’s] attendance” as District’s purportedly legitimate non-retaliatory
reason for terminating Plaintiff’s employment (Id., ¶ 4, Exh. 3); that
District produced Plaintiff’s attendance logs with its document production,
which reflected that Plaintiff was absent for a period in February 2023 and also
absent a few times in March 2023 (Id., ¶ 5); that the foregoing absences
coincided with the dates of Plaintiff’s severe COVID illness (Id.); that
Plaintiff’s former supervisor, Keith Kovach (“Kovach”), was deposed on April 2,
2024 (Id., ¶ 6, Exh. 4)[1]; that
she received Kovach’s deposition transcript on May 3, 2024 (Id., ¶ 7)
and that she unsuccessfully asked District’s counsel to stipulate to the filing
of the proposed SAC on May 14, 2024 and May 21, 2024 (Id., ¶ 8, Exh. 5).
District asserts
that it will be prejudiced if the instant motion were granted, because Kovach
and Rod Zerbel, Director of Personnel Services, have already been deposed, such
that it has been “depriv[ed]. . . of the opportunity to thoroughly and
adequately prepare a defense to these . . . new legal theories.” (Opp., 2:8-11;
see also, Huffman Decl., ¶¶ 2-4). Plaintiff, however, has specified that the
proposed SAC was drafted in partial response to the testimony obtained from
Kovach’s deposition regarding Plaintiff’s absences. Plaintiff has also
specified that District raised the issue of Plaintiff’s work absences in the
first instance, via its written discovery responses. Further, District fails to
explain why it would be prejudiced by the fact that Zerbel has already been deposed,
particularly given the fact that District would appear to have ready access to
Zerbel as its own employee. 
District also asserts
that “the proposed amendment will cause [it] to incur significant additional
expenses to conduct discovery.” (Opp., 4:20-21). The foregoing statement,
however, is unsupported.
The motion is
granted. The proposed SAC is deemed filed and served as of the date of the
instant hearing. The court declines District’s request, as a condition for
granting the motion, that the April 1, 2025 trial date be continued for “at
least” six months at this juncture.
