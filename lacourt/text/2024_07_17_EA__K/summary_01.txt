And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses from the defendants, Carlos Morrell and Brian Wiesner, to certain requests for production of documents. The judge orders Morrell to provide further responses to requests nos. 3, 16, 24-26, and 28, and Wiesner to provide further responses to requests nos. 25 and 26.

The judge also awards sanctions against Morrell in the amount of $1,460.00 and against Wiesner in the amount of $1,110.00. The sanctions are payable within 30 days of the notice of ruling.

The judge denies the defendant's motion to file documents under seal for in camera review, as California Rules of Court rules 2.550 and 2.551 are not applicable in the context of a discovery dispute.

The judge's ruling is based on the facts that Wiesner and Morrell failed to comply with discovery requests, and that their objections to the requests were without merit. The judge also notes that Wiesner has not satisfied his burden to justify his claims of privilege and that Morrell's inclusion of the phrase "in whole" in his responses suggests that he is at least able to comply in part with the requests.
