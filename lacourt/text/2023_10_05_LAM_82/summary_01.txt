And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for the appointment of a receiver to manage the 5th and L.A. joint venture. The defendants, Michael Khorshidi and Nejatolah Rabbanian, had requested the appointment of a receiver due to alleged mismanagement by the joint venture's managers, Alexander Javaheri and David Javaheri. The judge found that even if the allegations of mismanagement were true, the appointment of a receiver was not necessary, as the joint venture was still operational and profitable. The judge also noted that the defendants could assert a claim for damages resulting from any lower buy-out price if they were to sell their interest in the joint venture. The motion was denied, and the case will proceed.
