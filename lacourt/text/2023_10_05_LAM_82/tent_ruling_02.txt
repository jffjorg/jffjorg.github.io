            Petitioner
Fix the City, Inc. moves for an award of an attorney fees and costs in the
total amount of $155,670.41.  The request
is GRANTED IN PART.
 
I.       Background
 
            On
September 22, 2021, petitioner Fix the City, Inc. filed a petition for writ of
mandate challenging the issuance of certificates of occupancy for two separate
apartment buildings located at 1772 Glendon Avenue and 1751 Malcolm Avenue
pursuant to the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act (“AP Act”). (Prayer
¶¶ 1, 2.)  On February 20, 2022, the
Court (Hon. Mary H. Strobel) granted the petition for writ of mandate. The
Court ordered supplemental briefing with respect to the appropriate remedy and
set a hearing for April 11, 2023. 
 
            On
April 11, 2023, the Court ruled that it would issue a writ directing respondent
Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety (“LADBS”) to require real party
in interest HS Westside Properties, LLC to conduct further geologic
investigation of the potential fault trace in the vicinity of the Glendon
Avenue side of the Project shown in the 2018 Alquist Priolo Earthquake Fault
Zone map. The Court also ruled that it would direct LADBS to provide notice to
each occupant of the units at 1772 Glendon and 1751 Malcolm of the Court’s final
rulings in this matter and that forthcoming geologic seismic studies will be undertaken.
 
            On
April 24, 2023, the Court entered judgment granting the petition for writ of
mandate.  
 
II.      Analysis
 
A.          
Entitlement
to Fees under Code of Civil Procedure § 1021.5
 
          Petitioner seeks an award of attorney fees pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure § 1021.5. “Upon motion, a court may award attorneys’ fees to a
successful party against one or more opposing parties in any action which has
resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest….”
(CCP § 1021.5.) 
“[E]ligibility for
section 1021.5 attorney fees is established when ‘(1) plaintiffs’ action “has
resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public
interest,” (2) “a significant benefit, whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary has
been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons” and (3) “the
necessity and financial burden of private enforcement are such as to make the
award appropriate.”’” (Conservatorship of Whitley (2010) 50 Cal.4th
1206, 1214.)
 
1.           
Successful Party
 
A party “may be
considered successful if they succeed on any significant issue in the
litigation that achieves some of the benefit they sought in bringing suit.” (Ebbetts
Pass Forest Watch v. Department of Forestry & Fire Protection (2010)
187 Cal.App.4th 376, 382.) In determining whether the issue upon which a party
prevailed is significant, “the court must critically analyze the surrounding
circumstances of the litigation and pragmatically assess the gains achieved by
the action.” (Ibid.)
 
Here, petitioner succeeded
in obtaining writ relief directing LADBS to require real party to conduct further
geologic investigation after Fault Evaluation Report 259 of the California
Geological Survey (“FER 259”) and the resulting update to the Alquist Priolo Earthquake
Fault Zone Map in 2018 (“2018 AP Zone Map”) demonstrated a potential fault
trace in the southwesterly portion of the project near
Glendon. (2/28/23 Minute Order at 41-43; 4/11/23 Minute Order at 3, 6.) Because
petitioner prevailed on a significant issue in the litigation, petitioner is
the successful party under section 1021.5. Respondents City of Los Angeles, Los
Angeles Department of Building and Safety, and Board of Building and Safety
Commissioners do not argue otherwise.
 
2.           
Enforcement of Important
Right Affecting the Public Interest
 
“In assessing whether an
action has enforced an important right, courts should generally realistically
assess the significance of that right in terms of its relationship to the
achievement of fundamental legislative goals. As to the benefit, it may be conceptual
or doctrinal and need not be actual and concrete; further, the effectuation of
a statutory or constitutional purpose may be sufficient ... [However,] [t]he
benefit must inure primarily to the public. Thus, the statute directs the
judiciary to exercise judgment in attempting to ascertain the ‘strength’ or
‘societal importance’ of the right involved.” (Sandlin v. McLaughlin
(2020) 50 Cal.App.5th 805, 829, quoting Choi v. Orange County Great Park
Corp. (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 524, 531, internal quotations and citations
omitted.) 
 
In enacting the AP Act,
the Legislature declared two objectives: (1) “to provide policies and criteria
to assist cities, counties, and state agencies in the exercise of their
responsibility to prohibit the location of developments and structures for
human occupancy across the trace of active faults”; and (2) “to provide the
citizens of the state with increased safety and to minimize the loss of life
during and immediately following earthquakes by facilitating seismic
retrofitting to strengthen buildings, including historical buildings, against
ground shaking.” (Pub. Res. Code § 2621.5(a).) 
 
            Public Resources Code § 2623(b) states: “After a report
has been approved or a waiver granted, subsequent geologic reports shall not be
required, provided that new geologic data warranting further investigations is
not recorded.” The Court here found that the potential fault trace reflected in
FER 259 and the 2018 AP Zone Map constituted “new geologic data,” which necessitated
further geologic investigation. (2/28/23 Minute Order at 43.) Requiring further
geologic investigation advances the legislative objectives of assisting cities
to avoid approving structures for human occupancy across the trace of active
faults and providing citizens of the state with increased safety and to
minimize the loss of life during and immediately following earthquakes. 
 
Respondents do not contest
that the violation of the AP Act addressed by the judgment pertains to an important
right affecting the public interest. For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds
that petitioner’s action has resulted in the enforcement of an important right
affecting the public interest. 
 
3.           
Significant Benefit
Conferred on General Public or Large Class of Persons
 
“Whether a successful
party’s lawsuit confers a ‘significant benefit’ on the general public or a
large class of persons is a function of (1) ‘the significance of the benefit,’
and (2) ‘the size of the class receiving [the] benefit.’ [Citation.] In
evaluating these factors, courts are to ‘realistic[ally] assess[ ]’ the lawsuit’s
‘gains’ ‘in light of all the pertinent circumstances.’ [Citation.]” (La
Mirada Avenue Neighborhood Assn. of Hollywood v. City of Los Angeles (2018)
22 Cal.App.5th 1149, 1158.) “A benefit need not be monetary to be significant.
(§ 1021.5 [defining “a significant benefit” as either “pecuniary or
nonpecuinary”].) Where, as here, the nonpecuniary benefit to the public is the
proper enforcement of the law, the successful party must show that the law
being enforced furthers a significant policy. [Citation.]” (La Mirada,
22 Cal.App.5th at 1158.) 
 
Respondents argue that,
because the Court found that neither FER 259 nor the 2018 AP Zone Map
conclusively establishes the existence of a fault trace, petitioner has not
shown a significant benefit that was conferred on the general public or a large
class of persons. (4/11/23 Minute Order at 4.) “[T]he significant benefit
requirement of section 1021.5 requires more than a mere statutory violation.” (Burgess
v. Coronado Unified School District (2020) 59 Cal.App.5th 1, 9.) However, a
significant benefit can be found “simply from the effectuation of a fundamental
constitutional or statutory policy” “from a realistic assessment, in light of
all the pertinent circumstances, of the gains which have resulted in a
particular case.” (Woodland Hills Residents Assn., Inc. v. City Council
(1979) 23 Cal.3d 917, 939-40.)
 
Here, FER 259 and the
2018 AP Zone Map show the existence of a potential fault trace in the vicinity
of 1772 Glendon and 1751 Malcolm, where people reside. Ascertaining whether any
threat of harm to the residents of the project is not unlike environmental
actions in which a governmental agency is ordered to analyze or reassess
environmental impacts associated with a proposed project, which courts have
found to confer a significant benefit on members of the public living near a
proposed project site. (See Keep Our Mountains Quiet v. County of Santa
Clara (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 714, 737 [listing cases]; RiverWatch v.
County of San Diego Dept. of Environmental Health (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th
768, 782 [“With drought a persistent threat in California, public agencies and
members of the public living and working near the proposed project site
benefitted from the court's requiring DEH to specifically identify and address
the sources of water necessary to construct and operate the landfill”].) 
 
Here, the failure of real
party to properly consider the potential existence of a fault near the project presents
the threat of harm to the project’s residents. If further investigation were to
establish the existence of an active fault, then efforts could be made to abate
any such harm, including assessment of whether further retrofitting should be required.  The Court finds that the instant lawsuit
conferred a significant benefit on a large class of persons, specifically the
residents of the apartments at issue. 
 
4.           
Necessity and Financial
Burden of Private Enforcement
 
“[T]he necessity and
financial burden requirement really examines two issues: whether private
enforcement was necessary and whether the financial burden of private
enforcement warrants subsidizing the successful party’s attorneys.” (Whitley,
50 Cal.4th at 1214.) 
 
            Private enforcement was necessary in this case because
the petitioner brought the action against the government agencies responsible
for approving the construction of the project. (See Woodland Hills Residents
Assn., Inc. v. City Council (1979) 23 Cal.3d 917, 941 [“Inasmuch as the
present action proceeded against the only governmental agencies that bear
responsibility for the subdivision approval process, the necessity of private,
as compared to public, enforcement becomes clear”].) Further, the financial
burden of private enforcement warrants a fee award here, as petitioner did not
obtain any financial relief from the judgment. (See Whitley, 50 Cal.4th
at 1217 [“As a logical matter, a strong nonfinancial motivation does not change
or alleviate the ‘financial burden’ that a litigant bears”].) 
 
            Respondents do not argue that private enforcement by
petitioner was unnecessary or did not pose a financial burden. For the
foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the necessity and financial burden of
private enforcement by petitioner warrants a fee award under CCP § 1021.5. 
 
B.          
Reasonableness
of Fees Requested
 
Petitioner moves for $155,670.41
in fees and expenses. Petitioner’s request is comprised of (1) the fees on the
merits, (2) the fees incurred in connection with the fee motion, and (3) out-of-pocket
expenses. 
 
1.           
Merits
 
With respect to the fees
incurred in obtaining a favorable judgment, petitioner seeks a total of $130,515.00,
calculated as follows:
 



Timekeeper


Hours


Rate


Lodestar




Beverly Grossman Palmer


106.4


$800


$85,120.00




Michael J. Strumwasser


2.1


$900


$1,890.00

  Fees Requested for Merits


$87,010.00




Additional
  Multiplier for Merits


$43,505.00




TOTAL
  FOR MERITS:


$130,515.00



 
            The Court finds the asserted hourly rates to be
reasonable under the circumstances, and respondents to not suggest otherwise. 
 
            Respondents contend that the fee request should be
reduced by 15.60 hours, or a total of $12,480 (based on attorney Palmer’s hourly
rate), on the ground that fees for pre-litigation administrative proceedings
are not recoverable. Respondents’ citation to Beach Colony II v. California
Coastal Com. (1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 106 for this proposition is unavailing.
In Beach Colony II, the Court of Appeal compared CCP § 1021.5 with CCP §
1028.5 and noted that the “absence of any reference to administrative
proceedings in section 1021.5 suggests, at least, the section was not meant to
apply to non-judicial aspects of an administrative proceeding.” (Beach
Colony II, 166 Cal.App.3d at 116.) The Court of Appeal did not reach the
issue of whether CCP § 1021.5 allows for the recovery of fees “incurred
during the quasi-judicial portion of administrative proceedings from which
judicial review is taken through writ procedures.” (Ibid.; see also
Best v. California Apprenticeship Council (1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 1448,
1456 [“our holding in Beach Colony II left open the possibility that
section 1021.5 allows attorney's fees arising from quasi-judicial, as opposed
to quasi-legislative, administrative proceedings”].) 
 
Attorney fees incurred in
an administrative proceeding are compensable under CCP § 1021.5 if the
administrative proceeding is “useful and necessary to the public interest
litigation.” (Best, 193 Cal.App.3d at 1461; Edna Valley Watch v.
County of San Luis Obispo (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 1312, 1318-20.) Here, petitioner
was required to exhaust its administrative remedies by filing an appeal with the
Board of Building and Safety Commissions (“BBSC”) and create an administrative
record. Therefore, the administrative proceeding was useful and necessary to
this action. (See Best, 193 Cal.App.3d at 1461 [“Since the
administrative proceedings here were the first step in the litigation leading
to the mandamus proceeding (§ 1094.5), by their very nature they were useful
and of a type ordinarily necessary to the public interest litigation”].) Fees
may be awarded for the administrative proceedings to the extent they were
reasonably incurred. Respondents do not argue that the fees incurred during the
administrative proceedings were not reasonably incurred; their opposition to
such fees is limited to the argument that they are not recoverable at all. The
Court thus finds that petitioner may recover fees for the claimed 15.60 hours incurred
for the administrative proceedings. 
            
            Respondents also contend that the lodestar should be
reduced because petitioner only had limited success. “Courts have discretion to
compensate a partially successful plaintiff for time spent on unsuccessful
legal theories, provided such time was reasonably incurred.” (Environmental
Protection Information Center v. Department of Forestry & Fire Protection
(2010) 190 Cal.App.4th 217, 240.) In deciding the amount of an appropriate
reduction, the Court examines the goals and objectives of petitioner. (Ibid.
[“a reduction in the fee award may be appropriate where a plaintiff has failed
to succeed on some of its claims”].) “California courts have tended to
distinguish theories and claims by comparing the goals or objectives of the
plaintiff's litigation with the relief ultimately obtained.” (Ibid.)
 
            In the petition, petitioner asserted several theories: (1)
respondents violated the AP Act and city regulations by failing to require any
geologic investigation for the structure at 1772 Glendon (2/28/23 Minute Order
at 36-37); (2) LADBS could not rely on studies from Applied Earth Sciences
(“AES”) because AES did not comply with the AP Act and pertinent regulations (id.
at 37-41); (3) the mitigation recommended by AES and approved by LADBS—a
10-foot setback, mat foundations, or cantilevering—and did not comply with the
AP Act (id. at 44-46); and (4) new geologic data in FER 259 and the 2018
AP Zone Map warranted further investigation of the project (id. at
41-43). Petitioner did not prevail on the first three theories, which were
essentially challenges to the City’s approval of the 2015-2015 geological
studies and compliance measures.  
 
            Petitioner, however, did prevail on the fourth theory,
which was essentially a challenge to the failure to conduct further geological
investigation concerning the fault trace along the site.  As a consequence, the Court issued a Writ of
Mandate commanding LADBS to require HS Westside Properties, LLC to conduct
further geological investigation and provide notice to the occupants of the
apartment buildings at issue that forthcoming geologic seismic investigation
will be undertaken.  (4/24/23 Writ of
Mandate at 2.) 
 
            The Court has discretion to compensate petitioner for
time spent on the unsuccessful legal theories, i.e., all theories except
for the one based on failure to further investigate based on new geologic data.
“Attorneys generally must pursue all available legal avenues and theories in
pursuit of their clients' objectives; it is impossible, as a practical matter,
for an attorney to know in advance whether or not his or her work on a
potentially meritorious legal theory will ultimately prevail.” (Greene v.
Dillingham Construction, N.A., Inc. (2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 418, 424,
quoting Sokolow v. County of San Mateo (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 231, 250.)  The Court, however, declines to exercise such
discretion to compensate petitioner for attorney time spent on its failed legal
theories.
 
            Rather, given that petitioner’s theories can be grouped
into two types of challenges—(1) the challenge to the City’s approval of the
prior study and compliance measures and (2) the challenge to the failure to
conduct further geological investigation—the Court, in its discretion will award
half of the claimed merits fees.  In so
doing, the Court recognizes that petitioner achieved its objective of effectuating
a “critical state safety law intended to mitigate the hazard of surface
faulting to structures for human occupancy” by obtaining further investigation
to assure that the project adequately considers all fault traces in the
vicinity. (Pet. ¶ 1.) Considering that the goal of the AP Act is to provide
increased safety and minimize the loss of life during and immediately after
earthquakes (CCP § 2621.5), which is promoted by the further investigation
ordered by the Court, the Court finds that an award of 50% of the claimed fees
is appropriate, even though petitioner succeeded on only one of four (i.e.,
25%) of its asserted theories.
 
            Petitioner’s asserted lodestar of $87,010 is thus reduced
by 50% to $43,505.
 
            Petitioner
also seeks a 1.5 multiplier. Courts look to the following factors, among
others, in determining whether a multiplier is appropriate: “(1) the novelty
and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill displayed in presenting
them; (2) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other
employment by the attorneys; (3) the contingent nature of the fee award, both
from the point of view of eventual victory on the merits and the point of view
of establishing eligibility for an award; (4) the fact that an award against the
state would ultimately fall upon the taxpayers ….” (See Serrano v. Priest
(1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 48.)
 
            Here,
the Court finds that the requested 1.5 multiplier is warranted. Respondents do
not dispute petitioner’s contention that no published case addressed when
supplemental geologic reports were required in response to new geologic data.
Counsel for petitioner’s skill in persuading the Court of the merit of its
contention is demonstrated by the Court’s reliance on petitioner’s arguments in
its briefing. (2/28/23 Minute Order at 3.) Counsel for petitioner also agreed
to represent petitioner on a partially contingent basis with significantly
reduced rates. (Palmer Decl. ¶ 2.) A multiplier is designed to address the risk
that counsel bears of not receiving payment. (Graham v. DaimlerChrysler
Corp. (2004) 34 Cal.4th 553, 580 [“The contingent fee compensates the
lawyer not only for the legal services he renders but for the loan of those
services”].) 
 
Accordingly,
the Court awards petitioner $65,257.50 for fees incurred in obtaining a
favorable judgment ($87,010 merits request x .5 for partial success x 1.5
multiplier). 
 
2.           
Fee Motion
 
With respect to the fees
incurred in obtaining fees, petitioner seeks a total of $23,018.50, calculated
as follows:
 



Timekeeper


Hours


Rate


Lodestar




Beverly Grossman Palmer


16.1


$800


$12,880.00




Julia Michel


2.3


$495


$1,138.50




Fees for Fee Motion Reply and Argument (12.8 hours billed)[1]


$9,000.00




TOTAL FOR FEE MOTION:


$23,018.50




 
            The Court finds the asserted hourly rates to be reasonable under the
circumstances, and respondents to not suggest otherwise.
 
            The
Court finds that the hours billed for the motion and reply are excessive. In
light of attorney Palmer’s relatively high hourly rate and experience in filing
fee motions (Palmer Decl. ¶ 25), the Court finds that 8 hours for the motion
and 4 hours for the reply are more appropriate. Accordingly, the fees for the
fee motion are calculated as follows:
            



Timekeeper


Hours


Rate


Lodestar




Beverly Grossman Palmer


12


$800


$9,600.00




Julia Michel


2.3


$495


$1,138.50




TOTAL
  FOR FEE MOTION:


$10,738.50



 
C.          
Out-of-Pocket Expenses
 
Petitioner
seeks to recover $2,136.91 in costs. (Palmer Decl. ¶ 26 & Ex. B.)
Respondents object to $1,547.80 of those costs, which petitioner incurred in
appealing the issuance of the building permit and temporary certificate of
occupancy issued for the project. (See 2/28/23 Minute Order at 33.)
Respondents contend that the costs did not arise from the litigation itself and
therefore were not “reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation.” (CCP
§ 1033.5(c)(2).) Because petitioner was required to exhaust its administrative
remedies by appealing to the BBSC, as stated above, the Court finds that the costs
incurred in appealing to the BBSC are recoverable under CCP § 1033.5(c)(4).
 
D.         
Party or Parties Against Whom Fee Award Is
Directed
In
the original briefing, petitioner did not state who should be responsible for
paying the fee award. On August 29, 2023, the Court ordered the parties to file
supplemental briefs addressing to whom any order of fees requested by
petitioner should be directed. (8/29/23 Minute Order.) 
 
On
September 13, 2023, respondents filed a joint stipulation between them and real
party in interest HS Westside
Properties, LLC. The stipulation indicated that real party will not contest the
fee award being directed to it. (9/13/23 Stipulation at 2:24-27.) This accords
with case law finding that a real party can be held liable for attorney fees
under CCP § 1021.5. “[A] real party in interest in a mandamus proceeding that
has a direct interest in the litigation, more than merely an ideological or
policy interest, and actively participates in the litigation is an opposing
party within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 and can be
liable for attorney fees under the statute.” (Mejia v. City of Los Angeles
(2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 151, 161.) Real party has a direct interest in the
litigation as the developer of the subject project. Moreover, real party joined
in respondents’ opposition, filed a declaration in support of the opposition,
and filed a brief proposing a remedy for the writ of mandate. (1/27/23 Joinder
Brief; 4/4/23 Brief Regarding Potential Remedies.) Accordingly, the fee award
will be directed against real party. 
 
With respect to whether the fee award
should be directed against respondents as well, respondents contend that the
order of fees should be against real party only. (Resp. Supp. Brief at
2:18-19.) The joint stipulation states that real party agreed to indemnify
respondents against all costs the City incurred in defending the approval of
the project. (9/13/23 Stipulation at 2:8-12.) Irrespective of any indemnity
agreement between respondents and real party, petitioner is entitled to a fee
award against all opposing parties. “Generally speaking, the opposing party
liable for attorney fees under section 1021.5 has been the defendant person or
agency sued, which is responsible for initiating and maintaining actions or
policies that are deemed harmful to the public interest and that gave rise to
the litigation.” (Connerly v. State Personnel Bd. (2006) 37 Cal.4th
1169, 1176-77.) Respondents issued the building permits and certificates of
occupancy from which this proceeding arose. Accordingly, respondents are
opposing parties under CCP § 1021.5. 
 
Respondents do not cite any authority
supporting the notion that an indemnification agreement precludes the indemnitee
from being an opposing party for purposes of CCP § 1021.5 and being held liable
for the attorney fees of the successful party. San Bernardino Valley Audubon
Society, Inc. v. County of San Bernardino (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 738; Mejia
v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 151, 161; and Save the
Agoura Cornell Knoll v. City of Agoura Hills (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 665, all
cited by respondents, address whether a real party in interest can be liable
for attorney fees under CCP § 1021.5, but not whether the respondent governmental
agency can be relieved from liability for fees under the statute pursuant to an
indemnification agreement. Accordingly, the Court finds that attorney fees shall
be imposed on respondents as an opposing party. 
 
III.     Conclusion
 
            The motion is GRANTED IN PART. Using the appropriate lodestar approach, and
based on the foregoing findings and in view of the totality of the
circumstances, the total and reasonable amount of attorney fees and costs incurred
for the work performed in connection with the Petition for Writ of Mandate is $78,132.91 ($65,257.50 merits + $10,738.50 fee
motion + $2,136.91 costs).
 
            Such
fees are awarded to petitioner Fix the City, Inc. and against respondents City
of Los Angeles, Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety, and Board of Building
and Safety Commissioners and real party in interest HS Westside
Properties, LLC, jointly and severally. (See Friends of the Trails v. Blasius (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 810, 838, citing Civ. Code § 1431 [“When an
obligation is imposed on several persons it is presumed to be joint”].)
