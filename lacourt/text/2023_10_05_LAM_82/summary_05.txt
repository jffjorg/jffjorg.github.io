And here is the English-text summary:

In this tentative ruling, the Judge is considering the case of MWN, a respondent, against the City, a petitioner. The Judge notes that an independent consultant has verified MWN's net capital costs to be $26,650,948, while the fair market value of the Property is $17,710,000. The Judge believes that the City's obligation to reimburse MWN's net capital costs can be satisfied by transferring the title of the Property from the City to MWN. The Judge also references a California law, CEQA, which states that if a public agency properly finds that a project is exempt from environmental review, no further review is necessary. The Judge is considering the City's exemption from CEQA review and whether it is valid.
