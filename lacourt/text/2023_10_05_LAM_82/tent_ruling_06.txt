RE: PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION
  
Date:               10/5/23
(1:30 PM)
Case:               Dionne Wynn v. Selene Finance
LP, et al. (23STCV15619)
  
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff Dionne Wynn’s request for a preliminary injunction
is DENIED. 
 
The request for judicial notice as to Exhibits 1-7 is
GRANTED, pursuant to Evidence Code §§ 452(g)
and (h), but only for the limited purposes set forth in Fontenot v. Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 256, 265. (Fontenot,
198 Cal.App.4th at 265 [“Taken together, the decisions discussed above
establish that a court may take judicial notice of the fact of a document's
recordation, the date the document was recorded and executed, the parties to
the transaction reflected in a recorded document, and the document's legally
operative language, assuming there is no genuine dispute regarding the
document's authenticity”].”) 
 
The request for judicial notice as to Exhibits 8-11 is
GRANTED, pursuant to Evidence Code § 452(d). 
 
As a preliminary matter, on September 12, 2023, the Court
granted plaintiff’s ex parte application for a temporary restraining order and
enjoined defendants Selene Finance LP (“Selene”); Wilmington Savings Fund
Society, FSB dba Christiana Trust, Not Individually But As Trustee For Pretium
Mortgage Acquisition Trust (“Wilmington”); and MTC Financial Inc. dba Trustee
Corps from selling the property located at 3748 S Muirfield Rd, Los Angeles, CA
90016 (“Property”). (9/13/23 Order.) The Court ordered defendants to appear on
October 5, 2023 and show cause why they should not be enjoined from conducting
a trustee’s sale against the Property. (Ibid.) 
 
The Court ordered plaintiff to serve moving and supplemental
papers no later than September 15, 2023 with proof of service to be filed no
later than September 21, 2023. (9/13/23 Minute Order.) The Court did not deem
the ex parte application to be the moving papers. Plaintiff filed a “moving
paper” on September 19, 2023 and served it on September 20, 2023.
Notwithstanding the untimeliness of the moving paper, because defendants Selene
and Wilmington (collectively, “defendants”) addressed the substantive merits of
the moving paper in their opposition, the Court exercises its discretion and considers
the moving paper. (Rule of Court
3.1300(d) [“No paper may be rejected for filing on the ground that it was
untimely submitted for filing. If the court, in its discretion, refuses to
consider a late filed paper, the minutes or order must so indicate”].) 
 
With respect to evidence in support of the moving paper,
plaintiff did not file any evidence after the issuance of the temporary
restraining order. Plaintiff instead referenced the declaration filed in
support of the ex parte application. As stated above, the Court did not deem
the ex parte application to be the moving papers. Nevertheless, because
defendants addressed plaintiff’s declaration filed in support of the ex parte
application (Opp. at 12:14-19), the Court considers the declaration of
plaintiff filed on September 12, 2023 in the interests of resolving the OSC on
the merits. 
 
“[T]he question whether a preliminary injunction should be
granted involves two interrelated factors: (1) the likelihood that the
plaintiff will prevail on the merits, and (2) the relative balance of harms
that is likely to result from the granting or denial of interim injunctive
relief.”  (White v. Davis (2003) 30 Cal. 4th 528, 554.)
 
The Court first examines the likelihood that plaintiff will
prevail on the merits.
 
With respect to the first cause of action for Violation of
Civil Code § 2923.5, the statute “requires, before a notice of default may be
filed, that a lender contact the borrower in person or by phone to ‘assess’ the
borrower's financial situation and ‘explore’ options to prevent foreclosure.” (Mabry
v. Superior Court (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 208, 213-14.) Civil Code § 2923.5
also states: “A notice of default recorded pursuant to Section 2924 shall
include a declaration that the mortgage servicer has contacted the borrower,
has tried with due diligence to contact the borrower as required by this section,
or that no contact was required because the individual did not meet the
definition of ‘borrower’ pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 2920.5.” (Civ.
Code § 2923.5(b).)  
 
A Notice of Default was recorded on March 8, 2023. (Wynn
Decl. ¶ 12 & Ex. B; Fox Decl. ¶ 23 & RJN Ex. 6.) Plaintiff avers that no
defendant, including servicer Selene, contacted her by telephone or in person
to assess her finances or explore non-foreclosure options. (Wynn Decl. ¶ 14.)
However, defendants present evidence that pursuant to plaintiff’s request, plaintiff
was granted a loan modification in June 2021. (Fox Decl. ¶ 19 & RJN Ex. 4
[loan modification agreement notarized by plaintiff].) Accordingly, the Court
finds plaintiff’s claim that Selene’s agents gave her the “run around” in
connection with her attempts to apply for loan modifications is not credible. (See
Wynn Decl. ¶ 11.) 
 
Shortly after entering into the loan modification, beginning
in August 2021, plaintiff defaulted on the modified loan. (Fox Decl. ¶ 20 &
Ex. 19.) Selene’s records reflect that, between November 2021 and April 22,
2022 – at least 30 days prior to the recording of the Notice of Default (Civ.
Code § 2923.5(a)(1)(A) – Selene made at least 15 attempts to contact plaintiff
by telephone on different days of the week and different times of the day. (Fox
Decl. ¶ 24.) Selene also mailed letters to plaintiff on January 13, 2022, and
April 13, 2022, indicating that Selene has been attempting to reach plaintiff
and including phone numbers to HUD-certified housing counseling agencies. (Fox
Decl. ¶¶ 25-27 & Exs. 20, 21.) Defendants’ declaration demonstrates Selene’s
compliance with the “due diligence” requirements set forth in Civil Code § 2923.5(e)
at least 30 days before recording the Notice of Default on March 8, 2023. 
 
Based on the foregoing evidence, plaintiff fails to show a
likelihood of prevailing on the first cause of action for Violation of Civil
Code § 2923.5.
 
With respect to the second cause of action for Violation of
Civil Code § 2923.6(c)(1), this statute states: “If a borrower submits a
complete application for a first lien loan modification offered by, or through,
the borrower’s mortgage servicer at least five business days before a scheduled
foreclosure sale, a mortgage servicer, mortgagee, trustee, beneficiary, or
authorized agent shall not record a notice of default or notice of sale, or
conduct a trustee’s sale, while the complete first lien loan modification
application is pending. A mortgage servicer…shall not record a notice of
default or notice of sale or conduct a trustee’s sale until any of the
following occurs…
(3) The borrower accepts a written first lien loan
modification, but defaults on, or otherwise breaches the borrower’s obligations
under, the first lien loan modification.” 
 
Plaintiff contends that Selene did not provide promised
paperwork or in-person assistance to complete her loan modification
application. (Wynn Dec. ¶¶ 7-10.) As discussed above, Selene presents evidence
that plaintiff was granted a loan modification in June 2021 and that plaintiff
defaulted on the modified loan shortly thereafter in August 2021. (Fox Decl. ¶
19 & RJN Ex. 4; ¶ 20 & Ex. 19.) Insofar as plaintiff may have
subsequently applied for another loan modification, plaintiff fails to show
that “there has been a material change in the borrower’s financial
circumstances since the date of the borrower’s previous application and that
change is documented by the borrower and submitted to the mortgage servicer,”
such that defendants were required to consider the subsequent application for
loan modification before recording the Notice of Default on March 8, 2023 or
the Notice of Trustee’s Sale on June 16, 2023. (Civ. Code § 2923.6(g); Fox
Decl. ¶¶ 23, 28 & RJN Exs. 6, 7.) 
 
Based on the foregoing evidence, plaintiff fails to show a
likelihood of prevailing on the second cause of action for Violation of Civil
Code § 2923.6(c)(1).
 
With respect to the third cause of action for Violation of
Civil Code § 2923.7, this statute states: “When a borrower requests a
foreclosure prevention alternative, the mortgage servicer shall promptly
establish a single point of contact and provide to the borrower one or more
direct means of communication with the single point of contact.” (Civ. Code §
2923.7(a).) Plaintiff contends that, because the due diligence requirements
under Civil Code § 2923.5 were not satisfied, this evidences a failure to
assign her a single point of contact. (Wynn Decl. ¶ 15.) However, defendants
present evidence that, on January 13, 2022 and April 13, 2022, Selene sent
letters informing plaintiff that Selene has been trying to reach her and
providing her with the names of the single point of contact. (Fox Decl. ¶¶
25-27 & Exs. 20, 21.) In view of this evidence, plaintiff fails to
demonstrate a likelihood of prevailing on the third cause of action for
Violation of Civil Code § 2923.7. 
 
With respect to the fourth cause of action for Violation of
Business & Professions Code § 17200, this cause of action is predicated on
the first through third causes of action. (Compl. ¶¶ 93, 94.) Because plaintiff
fails to demonstrate a likelihood of prevailing on the first through third
causes of action, plaintiff fails to show any likelihood of prevailing on the
fourth cause of action for Violation of Business & Professions Code §
17200. 
 
Having failed to show a likelihood of prevailing on any
cause of action, plaintiff’s request for a preliminary injunction is DENIED,
notwithstanding any harm that may result from the denial of plaintiff’s
request. (Jessen v. Keystone Savings & Loan Assn. (1983) 142
Cal.App.3d 454, 459 [“In a practical sense it is appropriate to deny an
injunction where there is no showing of reasonable probability of success, even
though the foreclosure will create irreparable harm, because there is no
justification in delaying that harm where, although irreparable, it is also
inevitable”].) 
 
The temporary restraining order entered on September 13,
2023 is hereby DISSOLVED.  The Court’s
Order to Show Cause Re: Preliminary Injunction is DISCHARGED.
