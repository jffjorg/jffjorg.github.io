[TENTATIVE] RULING ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
 
Dept. 82 (Hon. Curtis A. Kin)
 




 
MWN COMMUNITY HOSPITAL, LLC,  


 
 
 
 
Real Party in Interest. 
 


 


 

 



 


 


 


 

 


          Petitioner Warren Blesofsky petitions
for a writ of mandate directing respondent City of Long Beach to vacate and set
aside a declaration of surplus land, determination of exemption under the
California Environmental Quality Act (“CEQA”), and transfer of City-owned
property to a private entity until respondent complies with the Surplus Land
Act and CEQA.
 
I.       Factual Background
 
            This
proceeding concerns 8.7 acres of real property located at 1720 Termino Avenue,
1760 Termino Avenue, and 4111 E. Wilton Street in Long Beach (“Property”),
which was owned by respondent City of Long Beach (“City”). (AR 235.) Through
several different private operators, an acute care hospital occupied the
Property for over 100 years. (AR 340.)  
 
            On
June 19, 2018, after the prior operator of the hospital terminated its lease
agreement with the City, the City Council authorized the execution of an
Exclusive Negotiation Agreement with the predecessor of real party in interest
MWN Community Hospital, LLC (“MWN”) for continued operation of the hospital. (AR
235-37.) 
 
          On October 15, 2019, the City Council authorized the execution of an
Amended and Restated Lease (“Lease”) with MWN for the operation of the
hospital. (AR 248-49, 148-202.) The Lease allowed MWN to terminate it if MWN
determined that it was not economically feasible to operate the hospital. (AR 175,
250.) Under the Lease, MWN was required to perform seismic retrofitting
mandated by the State of California for acute care hospitals. (AR 171-175, 250,
258-59.) In 2017, an active seismic fault line had been identified under the
acute care facility on the Property. (AR 276, 303.) The City agreed to reimburse MWN for its net capital costs to operate the
hospital, including seismic retrofitting costs, either directly, from proceeds
of the sale of the Property to MWN, or from a sale on the open market. (AR 178-179,
250-51.) 
          
          On September 27, 2021, MWN notified the City that it was not economically
feasible to provide acute care services. (AR 258.) The costs for seismic
retrofitting had increased by 50%, for which revenues from acute care services
were insufficient to cover. (AR 258.) MWN surrendered its general acute care
hospital license effective December 31, 2021. (AR 224, 258.) 
 
On February 15, 2022,
pursuant to MWN’s request, the City Council authorized the removal of the
requirement in the Lease to operate an acute care hospital on the Property. (AR
258.) In recommending to the City Council that it adopt such an amendment to
the Lease, the City’s Economic Development Department described the amendment
“as necessary to accommodate the ongoing negotiations between the City and the
Tenant [MWN] for potential sale pursuant to the Lease.”  (AR 259.) 
The City Council thus amended the Lease to allow MWN to provide
non-acute services such as behavioral health, recuperative care, social
services, education, government offices, housing for healthcare students, and other
specialized services. (AR 204, 259.) The amendment to the Lease was fully
executed on March 29, 2022. (AR 206.) 
The amendment explicitly notes the City and MWN “are currently in the
process of . . . preparation for the potential transfer of the Premises.”  (AR 203.)
 
            To reimburse MWN for the net capital costs MWN had incurred
to operate the hospital, the City Council elected to sell the Property to MWN
for a purchase price of zero dollars in accordance with the Lease.[1]
(AR 10-13.) On October 4, 2022, the City’s staff recommended the City Council (1)
declare the Property as surplus, (2) authorize the execution of an agreement for
transfer of the Property to MWN for zero dollars, and (3) determine that the declaration
and transfer were categorically exempt from the California Environmental
Quality Act (“CEQA”) pursuant to the Class 12 exemption for surplus government
property sales (14 C.C.R. § 15312). (AR 10-15.)
 
          Petitioner Warren Blesofsky, a Long Beach resident and taxpayer, submitted,
through counsel, a letter to the City Council objecting to the declaration of
surplus property and sale of the Property. (AR 227-29.) Petitioner argued that (1)
the declaration of surplus property was not accompanied by a finding that the
property is not necessary for the City’s use, as purportedly required by the
Surplus Land Act, (2) the Surplus Land Act required the Property to be put to
bid for development of affordable housing development, and (3) the City
violated CEQA by segmenting the change of use from the declaration of surplus
property and transfer to render both of those actions exempt from environmental
review. (AR 227-29.)
 
          On October 4, 2022, despite petitioner’s objection, the City Council
approved the recommendation of the City’s staff with respect to the Property.
(AR 79-80.) The City filed a CEQA Notice of Exemption on October 14, 2022,
which erroneously stated: “The project involves the transfer of ownership of an
existing cemetery with no proposed change of use.” (AR 3, 5, emphasis
added.) On October 27, 2022, the City filed a revised CEQA Notice of Exemption,
stating: “The project involves the transfer of ownership of an existing
hospital with no proposed change of use.” (AR 2, 4.) 
 
II.      Procedural History
 
            On
November 18, 2022, petitioner filed a verified petition for writ of mandate. On
July 14, 2023, petitioner filed a verified first amended petition for writ of
mandate. On August 15, 2023, respondent filed an answer. 
 
            On July 14, 2023, the same day
the first amended petition was filed, petitioner filed an opening brief. On August
15, 2023, respondent filed an opposition. On August 30, 2023, petitioner filed
a reply. The Court has received an electronic copy of the administrative record
and an electronic and hard copy of the joint appendix. 
             
III.     Request
for Judicial Notice
 
          Petitioner’s request to take judicial notice of Exhibit 1 (California
Department of Housing and Community Development’s “List of Developers that have
notified the Department of Housing and Community Development of Interest in
Surplus Land”) is GRANTED, pursuant to Evidence Code § 452(h).
 
            Respondent’s request to take judicial notice of Exhibits
A-D (agendas and meeting minutes of the City Council of the City of Long Beach)
is GRANTED, pursuant to Evidence Code § 452(b).
 
            Respondent’s request to take judicial notice of Exhibit E
(copy of the recorded grant deed transferring title of the Property) is GRANTED,
pursuant to Evidence Code § 452(h). 
 
            Respondent’s request to take judicial notice of Exhibits
F-H (provisions of the Surplus Land Act as they existed on December 31, 2019)
is GRANTED, pursuant to Evidence Code § 452(a).
 
IV.     Standard of Review
 
Review
of an agency’s quasi-legislative decisions occurs with an ordinary or
traditional writ of mandate petition under CCP § 1085. (Martis Camp
Community Association v. County of Placer (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 569, 593.)
CCP § 1085(a) provides: “A writ of mandate may be issued by any court to any
inferior tribunal, corporation, board, or person, to compel the performance of
an act which the law specially enjoins, as a duty resulting from an office,
trust, or station, or to compel the admission of a party to the use and
enjoyment of a right or office to which the party is entitled, and from which
the party is unlawfully precluded by that inferior tribunal, corporation,
board, or person.”
 
“There
are two essential requirements to the issuance of a traditional writ of
mandate: (1) a clear, present and usually ministerial duty on the part of the
respondent, and (2) a clear, present and beneficial right on the part of the
petitioner to the performance of that duty.” (California Assn. for Health
Services at Home v. State Dept. of Health Services (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
696, 704.) “An action in ordinary mandamus is proper where…the claim is that an
agency has failed to act as required by law.” (Id. at 705.)
 
“When
a party seeks review of an administrative decision pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 1085, judicial review is limited to examining the agency
proceedings to ascertain whether the agency's action has been arbitrary,
capricious or lacking entirely in evidentiary support, or whether the agency
failed to follow the proper procedure and give notices required by law. And,
where the case involves the interpretation of a statute or ordinance, our
review of the trial court's decision is de novo.” (Ideal Boat & Camper
Storage v. County of Alameda (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 301, 311, citing Pomona
Police Officers' Assn. v. City of Pomona (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 578, 584.) In
independently reviewing legal questions, “An administrative agency's
interpretation does not bind judicial review but it is entitled to
consideration and respect.” (Housing Partners I, Inc. v. Duncan (2012)
206 Cal.App.4th 1335, 1343.) 
 
An
agency is presumed to have regularly performed its official duties. (Evid. Code
§ 664.) In a CCP § 1085 writ petition, the petitioner generally bears the
burden of proof. (California Correctional Peace Officers Assn. v. State Personnel
Bd. (1995) 10 Cal.4th 1133, 1154.)         
 
V.      Analysis
 
A.          
First Cause of Action – Surplus Land Act
 
1.           
Overview of Act
 
The Surplus Land Act (“SLA”) “advances state land
use policy objectives by mandating a uniform approach to the disposition of
land that local public agencies, including charter cities, no longer need. [Citations.]
In a nutshell, the Act establishes procedures requiring ‘[a]ny local agency
disposing of surplus’ government land to first notify in writing certain public
entities of the offer to sell or lease the property for a designated purpose.
[Citations.] The listed purposes that require entity notification are ‘low- and
moderate-income housing’ ([Gov. Code] § 54222, subd. (a)) and park and
recreational or open space purposes (id., subd. (b)), as well as
purposes related to school facilities, enterprise zones, and infill
opportunities (id., subds. (c)-(e)).” (Anderson v. City of San Jose
(2019) 42 Cal.App.5th 683, 705.)
 
As a preliminary matter, the SLA provides that, if
the local agency entered into an exclusive negotiating agreement to dispose of
property as of September 30, 2019, and if the disposition was completed by
December 31, 2022, as applicable here, then the disposition of the property is
governed by the SLA as it existed on December 31, 2019. (Gov. Code § 54234(a).)
The exclusive negotiating agreement between the City and MWN was effective on
July 3, 2018. (AR 87-99.) The grant deed transferring the Property was recorded
on October 31, 2022. (City RJN Ex. E.) The parties do not dispute, for the
purposes here, that the SLA as it existed on December 31, 2019, applies. (OB at
13:16-17; Opp. at 17:19-20.)
 
The SLA defines “surplus land” as “land owned by
any local agency, that is determined to be no longer necessary for the agency’s
use, except property being held by the agency for the purpose of exchange.” (Former
Gov. Code § 54221(b), provided in City RJN Ex. G.) On October 4, 2022, the City
Council declared the Property as surplus. (AR 79-80.) 
 
2.             
Sufficiency of Declaration of Surplus Land
 
Citing former Government Code § 54221(b),
petitioner contends that the City’s declaration of surplus land was not
supported by substantial evidence. However, former section Government Code §
54221(b) contains no such requirement. Rather, the statute provides a
definition of surplus land. (Former Gov. Code § 54221(b), provided in City RJN
Ex. G.) Petitioner’s citation to Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community v.
County of Los Angeles (1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, in which the Supreme Court
found that “[i]mplicit in section 1094.5 is a requirement that the agency which
renders the challenged decision must set forth findings to bridge the analytic
gap between the raw evidence and ultimate decision or order.” 
 
The instant proceeding is not brought pursuant to CCP
§ 1094.5, as the Court is not reviewing any “final administrative order or
decision made as the result of a proceeding in which by law a hearing is
required to be given.” (See CCP § 1094.5(a).) In any event, the City’s
EDD department explained that the costs of State-required seismic retrofitting
for acute care hospitals increased prohibitively to the point that revenues
from acute care operations would not cover the costs. (AR 258.) Thus, to the
extent requirement for substantial evidence as set forth in Topanga applies
to the instant proceeding, the EDD’s analysis sufficiently establishes that the
Property was no longer necessary for the City’s use, i.e., as an acute
care hospital, because the Property could not be used for that intended use. 
 
Accordingly, the Court finds that the City was
sufficiently justified in making its declaration of surplus land.
 
3.           
Written Offer to Lease or Sell
 
Petitioner contends that the record does not
reflect that any written offer to lease or sell the Property was sent to the
entities listed in former Government Code § 54222. (Former Gov. Code §
54222, provided in City RJN Ex. H.) Petitioner also contends that the City’s
declaration of surplus land was not supported by substantial evidence. 
 
With respect to the first contention, the City does
not dispute that it did not send any written offers to lease or sell to the
entities set forth in former Government Code § 54222. Instead, the City
contends that such offers would have been futile because the Property was
located on an active earthquake fault and recorded covenants limit the use of
the Property for healthcare. (AR 276, 303 [earthquake fault]; City RJN Ex. E
[healthcare covenant].) Former Government Code § 54222 contains no exceptions
for futility that would excuse the City’s obligation to send out the required
offers to lease or sell.
 
In any event, with respect to the earthquake fault,
14 C.C.R. § 3602 presumes that the area within 50 feet of an active fault is unsuitable
for structures for human occupancy, i.e., housing. (14 C.C.R. § 3602(a).)
However, the City determined that the portions of the Property beyond 50 feet
from the fault are seismically safe, thereby accommodating housing potentially.
(AR 276 [portion of map shaded in blue].) Likewise, a restrictive covenant for
use of the land could be lifted or declared invalid when circumstances
justifying the covenant have changed, thereby allowing for other uses of the Property.  (See Wolff v. Fallon (1955) 44
Cal.2d 695; Hess v. Country Club Park (1931) 213 Cal. 613.) Accordingly,
a written offer to lease or sell the Property for the purpose of developing
low- and moderate-income housing or other uses by entities entitled to receive a
written lease or sell offer would not have been necessarily futile.
 
 
4.           
Available Relief 
 
Even if there was an SLA violation, the City
contends that former Government Code § 54230.5 limits the available remedies
for the violation, because that code provision explicitly bars the invalidation
of the transfer of the Property to MWN. 
Thus, according to the City, the relief petitioner seeks cannot be
obtained.  (Cf. FAP at 12 [prayer
for relief seeking (1) to vacate or set aside the transfer or (2) a stay,
temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, and permanent injunction
“prohibiting any actions by [City] pursuant to [City]’s declaration of surplus
land [and] transfer”].)   The Court
agrees.
 
Former Government Code § 54230.5 states: “The
failure by a local agency to comply with this article shall not invalidate the
transfer or conveyance of real property to a purchaser or encumbrancer for
value.” (Former Gov. Code § 54230.5, provided in City RJN Ex. F.) Here,
although the purchase price for the Property was zero dollars, the City
nonetheless transferred or conveyed the Property to MWN for value.  The agreed-upon fair market value for the
Property was $17,710,000, and, in exchange for transferring that property to
MWN, the City’s obligation to reimburse MWN’s net capital costs of $26,650,948
for operating the hospital (including seismic  retrofit expenditures) was deemed satisfied
per the terms of the Lease.  (AR 12,
178-183, 251.)  There can be no serious
doubt the City received value for the transfer or conveyance of the Property.  Thus, although the City violated the SLA by
transferring the Property to MWN without first sending written offers to lease
or sell such Property to the entities listed in former Government Code
§ 54222, the City’s violation cannot cause the City’s transfer to MWN to
be invalidated.
 
Although invalidation
of the Property transfer is not an available remedy, petitioner contends that declaratory
relief may be had for the SLA violation. 
Generally speaking, petitioner is correct that “declaratory relief may
be awarded in a mandamus action.” (Malott v. Summerland Sanitary Dist.
(2020) 55 Cal.App.5th 1102, 1110.) 
However, “the fundamental
basis of declaratory relief is the existence of an actual, present controversy
over a proper subject.”  (In re
Tobacco Cases II (2015) 240 Cal.App.4th 779, 804.)  In such a case, the Court may exercise its
discretion to provide declaratory relief it finds “necessary” and
“proper.”  (Ibid.)  But here, a mere declaration that the City
violated the SLA in connection with transferring the Property to MWN is neither
necessary nor proper, because it would serve no purpose.  The transfer has occurred, and, as discussed
above, it cannot be invalidated.[2]  There is thus “no likelihood of future
violations” and “[t]he parties need no judicial guidance to conform their
conduct to the law or avoid future litigation.” 
(Id. at 805; see also Kirkwood v. California State Automobile
Ass’n (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 49, 59 [“Declaratory
relief operates prospectively, serving to set controversies at rest before obligations
are repudiated, rights are invaded or wrongs are committed,  Thus the
remedy is to be used to advance preventive justice, to declare rather than
execute rights. [Citation.] Declaratory relief serves a practical purpose
in stabilizing an uncertain or disputed legal relation, thereby defusing doubts
which might otherwise lead to subsequent litigation”]; Gafcon, Inc. v.
Ponsor & Assocs. (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 1388, 1403 [“[D]eclaratory
relief operates prospectively, and not merely for the redress of past wrongs”].) 
 
5.           
Conclusion
 
The Court finds the City failed to act as required
by law when it did not send any written offer to lease or sell the Property to
the entities set forth in former Government Code § 54222.  However, the Court cannot provide any relief
for the violation.  Accordingly, the
petition is DENIED as to the first cause of action for violation of the Surplus
Land Act. 
 
B.          
Second Cause of Action – Violation of CEQA
 
1.           
Overview of CEQA
 
“With narrow exceptions, CEQA requires an EIR [environmental
impact report] whenever a public agency proposes to approve or to carry out a
project that may have a significant effect on the environment.” (Laurel
Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of California (1988) 47
Cal.3d 376, 390.) “Project” means “the whole of an action, which has a
potential for resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment,
or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment….”
(CEQA Guidelines [codified in 14 C.C.R. § 15000 et seq.] § 15378(a).) The broad
definition of project “ensures CEQA's requirements are not avoided by chopping
a proposed activity into bite-sized pieces which, when taken individually, may
have no significant adverse effect on the environment.” (POET, LLC v. State
Air Resources Board (2017) 12 Cal.App.5th 52, 73.) “‘CEQA forbids “piecemeal”
review of the significant environmental impacts of a project.’ [Citation.]” (Banning
Ranch Conservancy v. City of Newport Beach (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 1209,
1222.)
 
In a CEQA Notice of Exemption, the City asserted
that the transfer of the subject Property to MWN was exempt from CEQA under 14
C.C.R. § 15312 because it was a “transfer of ownership of an existing hospital
with no proposed change of use” and the Property was surplus.[3]
(AR 4; see also Guidelines § 15312(b)(3) [Class 12 categorical exemption
for sale of surplus government property where the “use of the property and
adjacent property has not changed since the time of purchase by the public
agency”].) 
 
“The lead agency has the burden to demonstrate that
a project falls within a categorical exemption and the agency’s determination
must be supported by substantial evidence.” (Citizens for Environmental
Responsibility v. State ex rel. 14th Dist. Ag. Assn. (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th
555, 568.) “Where the record contains evidence bearing on the
question whether the project qualifies for the exemption…and the agency makes
factual determinations as to whether the project fits within an exemption
category, we determine whether the record contains substantial evidence to
support the agency's decision.” (Save Our Carmel River v. Monterey Peninsula
Water Management Dist. (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 677, 694.)
 
2.           
Change of Use and Improper Piecemealing
 
Petitioner contends that, on February 15, 2022, the
City intentionally changed the use of the Property from an acute care hospital
to non-acute care services, which would have taken the transfer of the Property
out of the exemption had the Property also been sold at the same time. Petitioner
raises the question of whether the City improperly segmented (i.e.,
engaged in piecemealing) the change of use from the sale of the Property to
avoid certain obligations under CEQA. 
 
Whether several actions constitute a single project
is generally a question of law. (Tuolomne County Citizens for Respondent
Growth, Inc. v. City of Sonora (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 1214, 1223-24.) The
California Supreme Court has set forth the following piecemealing test: “[A]n
EIR must include an analysis of the environmental effects of future expansion
or other action if: (1) it is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the
initial project; and (2) the future expansion or action will be significant in
that it will likely change the scope or nature of the initial project or its
environmental effects.” (Laurel Heights, 47 Cal.3d at 396; see also
County of Ventura v. City of Moorpark (2018) 24 Cal.App.5th 377, 385 [where
two activities are “part of a coordinated endeavor” they may constitute a
single project].)
 
What constitutes a “reasonably foreseeable
consequence” has been described as “murky.” (Banning Ranch, 211 Cal.App.4th
at 1222.) However, case law instructs that there are two types of cases where
improper piecemealing has been found: (1) “when the purpose of the reviewed
project is to be the first step toward future development”; and (2) “when the
reviewed project legally compels or practically presumes completion of another
action.” (Id. at 1223.) 
 
Petitioner contends that, on February 15, 2022,
when the City Council instituted a
change of use of the Property by amending the Lease to allow MWN to provide
non-acute services, the City knew full well that it did so in
furtherance of selling the Property, albeit at a later time.  That is true. 
In the February 15, 2022  Resolution
No. RES-22-0032 (“Resolution”) approving the change of use, the City explicitly
acknowledged that “the Subject Property shall be sold to Tenant or a
third-party in accordance with procedures provided for in the Lease, provided that
in either event the Subject Property shall be restricted primarily to the
provision of health care services to the surrounding community and related and
supporting uses….” (AR 6.) The City’s Economic Development Department’s (“EDD”)
recommendation for the City Council to adopt that Resolution also was clear
such a change was “necessary to accommodate ongoing negotiations between the
City and the Tenant for potential sale of the Subject Property pursuant to the
Lease….” (AR 259.) Indeed, the amendment to the Lease itself conceded the City
and MWN “are currently in the process of preparing, exchanging, reviewing, and
approving various documentation as required by the Lease . . . in preparation
for the potential transfer of the Premises.” (AR 203.)  Further, the City’s intent was again
confirmed in the EDD’s recommendation
that the City Council approve transfer of the Property to MWN on October 4,
2022, acknowledging: “On February 15,2022 the City Council approved this
request [to amend the Lease] as noted above and the City and Tenant have
continued negotiations for a Tenant Sale Option while the Tenant continues its
efforts to determine viability of converting the Subject Property to a general
healthcare campus….” (AR 11.)
 
The City’s own words reveal
that the whole of the project for CEQA purposes was to sell or transfer the
Property with the use restriction for acute care lifted.  Indeed, even without the City’s multiple
statements indicating such a plan, it is most logical to conclude that the sale
or transfer of the Property—whether to MWN or by sale on the open market to some
third-party—only made sense if the acute services restriction were lifted.  It is undisputed that operating the Property
as an acute care facility was not economically feasible (see AR 6, 11, 258), and,
accordingly, only a change of use would render the Property marketable to MWN
or any other third-party in the future.
 
The Court thus finds
that the February 15, 2022 authorization of the change of use did “practically
presume” the subsequent transfer of the Property to MWN or a third party. (See
Banning Ranch, 211 Cal.App.4th at 1222.) 
The City therefore could not
avoid the requirement under CEQA to evaluate the environmental effect of the
transfer of the Property to MWN separate and apart from the change of use of
the Project from acute to non-acute. Accordingly, the City could not rely on
the Class 12 exemption from CEQA, which applies only to sales and transfers of
surplus land without a change of use. (Cf., e.g., Arviv
Enterprises, Inc. v. South Valley Area Planning Com. (2002) 101
Cal.App.4th 1333 [housing developer could not segment a project for a 21-hosue
development by seeking permits for smaller portions of the project]; Citizens
Assn. for Sensible Development of Bishop Area v. County of Inyo (1985) 172
Cal.App.3d 151 [county improperly divided proposed shopping center project into
two different sets of approvals—one concerning rezoning and the other
concerning subdivision of lots and road abandonment].) 
 
3.           
Statute of Limitations
 
Citing Public Resources § 21167(a), the City argues
that the instant proceeding, as framed by petitioner, is time-barred. Public
Resources § 21167(a) states: “An action or proceeding alleging that a public
agency is carrying out or has approved a project that may have a significant
effect on the environment without having determined whether the project may
have a significant effect on the environment shall be commenced within 180 days
from the date of the public agency’s decision to carry out or approve the
project, or, if a project is undertaken without a formal decision by the public
agency, within 180 days from the date of commencement of the project.” 
 
However, petitioner’s challenge is not simply to the
February 15, 2022 approval of change of use. Rather, Petitioner challenges the
project as a whole, namely, the transfer of the Property to MWN after having effectuated
a change of use on October 19, 2022, and accompanying notice of exemption claiming
no change in use. (Pet. ¶ 28; FAP ¶ 44.) Accordingly, the 35-day statute of
limitations under Public Resources Code § 21167(d) applies. (See Guidelines
§ 15112(c)(2) [providing for 35-day statute of limitations where public agency
filed notice of exemption], (c)(5) [providing that 180-day statute of
limitations applies “[w]here none of the other statute of limitations periods
in this section apply”].)
 
The Notice of Exemption stating there was no
proposed change of use from an existing hospital was filed and posted on
October 27, 2022. (AR 2, 4.) Petitioner
commenced this proceeding on November 18, 2022, within 35 days from the date of
filing and posting. The instant proceeding is therefore timely. 
            
4.           
Conclusion
 
            Based
on the foregoing, the Court finds that the City improperly piecemealed the
change of use from the transfer of the Property to avoid certain obligations
under CEQA. Accordingly, the CEQA Notice of Exemption (AR 2) is deemed invalid,
and the City shall comply with its obligations under CEQA concerning the
transfer of the Property to MWN with the change of use.
 


VI.     Conclusion
 
The
petition is GRANTED as to the second cause of action for Violation of CEQA. Pursuant
to Local Rule 3.231(n), petitioner shall prepare, serve, and ultimately file a
proposed judgment and proposed writ of mandate.
