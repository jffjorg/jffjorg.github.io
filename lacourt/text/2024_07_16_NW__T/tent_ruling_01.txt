  Case Number:  23VECV01049    Hearing Date:   July 16, 2024    Dept:  T ALVAREZ  V MCGUIRE 23VECV01049   SUMMARY OF  TENTATIVE RULINGS AS TO CROSS-COMPLAINT   Summary  judgment is DENIED as to Cross-Defendant Alvarez. Summary  judgment is GRANTED as to Cross-Defendants Leocadio and Enamorado. Summary  adjudication of First Cause of Action DENIED as to Cross-Defendant Alvarez. Summary  adjudication of the Second Cause of Action GRANTED as to Cross-Defendant  Alvarez. Summary  adjudication of the Third Cause of Action MOOT as not asserted against  Cross-Defendant Alvarez. Summary  Adjudication of the Fourth Cause of Action DENIED as to Cross-Defendant  Alvarez. Summary  adjudication of the Fifth Cause of Action GRANTED as to Cross-Defendant  Alvarez.   Accordingly,  on the Cross-Complaint, the only remaining issues to be tried by  Cross-Complainant McGuire are against Cross-Defendant Alvarez on the First  Cause of Action for Assault and the Fourth Cause of Action for Intentional  Infliction of Emotional Distress. _____________________________________________________________________ Cross-Defendants  Jonathan Alvarez (Alvarez), Tomas Leocadio (Leocadio), and Edin Alex Enamorado  (Enamorado) seek summary judgment on the First Amended Complaint by  Cross-Complainant Dan McGuire (McGuire).   The motion also seeks summary adjudication of each of the five causes of  action.   CCP section  437c allows for summary judgment if it is contended that the action has not  merit, that are no triable issues of material fact, and that moving party is  entitled to win the case as a matter of law. “The motion  for summary judgment shall be granted if all the papers submitted show that  there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is  entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd.  (c).) The party moving for summary judgment carries both the burden of  persuasion and the burden of production of evidence."(Evid. Code, § 500;  Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850.) To prevail on  summary judgment, a [Cross-Defendant] must show that the “cause of action has  no merit” by demonstrating “that one or more of the elements of the cause of  action . . . cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to that  cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).)[Emphasis added.]   A  Cross-Defendant “may point to the absence of evidence to support the  [Cross-Complainant’s[ case, or present affirmative evidence negating an  essential element of the [Cross-Complainant’s[ claim. (Leslie G. v. Perry  & Assocs. (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 472, 482 (italics omitted); Guz v. Bechtel  Nat’l, Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 317, 334–335.)[Emphasis added.] A  [Cross-Defendant] need not conclusively negate an element of the  [Cross-Complainant’s] cause of action, but must only “show that the  [Cross-Complainant] does not possess needed evidence . . . [and] that the  [Cross-Complainant] cannot reasonably obtain needed evidence.” (Aguilar v.  Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 854).[Emphasis added.] If  Cross-Defendant establishes by admissible facts their burden, then “the burden  [then] shifts to the [Cross-Complainant] . . . to show that a triable issue  of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense  thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).)[Emphasis added.]  To avoid  summary judgment, the Cross-Complainant must “set forth the specific facts  showing that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists.” (Ibid.)  “[T]he [Cross-Complainant] must produce substantial responsive evidence  sufficient to establish a triable issue of material fact on the merits of the  [Cross-Defendant’s] showing.” (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151,  162–163.) “[R]esponsive evidence that gives rise to no more than mere  speculation cannot be regarded as substantial, and is insufficient to establish  a triable issue of material fact.” (Id. at p. 163.)[Emphasis added.] The  [Cross-Complaint] represents the “outer measure of materiality” for a summary  judgment motion, which may not be denied on issues not raised therein. (FPI Dev.,  Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 381.) If the [Cross-Complainant]  cannot carry the burden of producing substantial admissible evidence to  establish a triable issue of material fact, the [Cross-Defendant] is entitled  to judgment as a matter of law. (Saelzler v. Advanced Grp. 400 (2001) 25  Cal.4th 763, 780–781.) See:research.ceb.com/practitioner/standard-documents/summary-judgment-legal  standard. The court  reviewed the moving and opposition papers, the reply papers, the exhibits  submitted by the parties (except for a video which was no longer online), the  declarations of the parties, the separate statement and the response to  separate statement. Cross-Defendants  met their burden of providing admissible evidence in support of their motion. However, the  evidence provided by Cross-Complainant in opposition to the motion is full of  speculation and unsupported statements in his declaration.  He has lumped all three defendants together  without specific evidence against any of them except as to Cross-Defendant  Alvarez.  He cites to videos in which  there is no identification of any party.   He does not state facts to explain how he can identify any of the  Cross-Defendants by name.  He does not  provide any evidence of the zoning, of licensure, or business registration. He  has attached no documents as evidence.   His Cross-Complaint also does not attach any evidence. The video does  not show an angry racist mob of anarchists. He cites to a video which shows he  was imprisoned but there is no video which shows this. He overgeneralizes in  his declaration without specifics.  His  evidence cannot be regarded as substantial and, therefore, is insufficient to  establish triable issues of fact. Summary  adjudication motions allow a court to adjudicate a limited set of issues  specified in California’s summary judgment statute, section 437c, subdivision  of the Code of Civil Procedure. Summary adjudication is authorized to  adjudicate one or more causes of action within the action; one or more  affirmative defenses within the action; that there is no valid claim for  punitive damages; or that the Cross-Defendant did, or did not, owe the  Cross-Complainant a duty. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd.(f)(1).) Here, the  moving parties seeks adjudication of each cause of action. Cross-Defendants  Alvarez, Leocadio, and Enamorado submit that because there are no triable  issues of fact as to the following issues 1-5, the motion for summary judgment  or adjudication should be granted: 1. Cross-Defendants never assaulted  McGuire (First Cause of Action for Assault) 2. Cross-Defendant  Jonathan Alvarez (“Alvarez”) and Tomas Leocadio (“Leocadio”) fruit stand was  not a private nor public nuisance (Second Cause of Action to Abate a Nuisance) 3. Cross-Defendants  Leocadio and Edin Alex Enamorado (“Enamorado”) did not falsely imprison McGuire  (Third Cause of Action for False Imprisonment) 4. Cross-Defendants'  alleged acts against McGuire do not rise to extreme and outrageous conduct  (Fourth Cause of Action for Intentional  Infliction of Emotional Distress) 5.  Cross-Defendants did not breach any  duty of care as it related to McGuire (Negligence) The court  addresses these issues separately:   1.           CROSS-DEFENDANTS NEVER ASSAULTED  MCGUIRE    As to Alvarez Alvarez  contends he did not assault McGuire (XDSS para. 58, 59) McGuire  contends that Alvarez threatened to kill him and his dog with a knife (XCSS  59.)
