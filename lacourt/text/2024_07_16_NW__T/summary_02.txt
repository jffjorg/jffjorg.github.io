And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiffs' motion for judgment on the pleadings. The plaintiffs, Russell M. Frandsen, Christie H. Frandsen, Andre Berger, and Tracy Berger, claimed that the defendants' answer failed to state sufficient facts to constitute a defense to the cause of action for unlawful detainer. The defendants, Foxman, denied certain allegations but did not provide specific denials for each. The judge found that the defendants' denials were sufficient and clear, and therefore denied the motion. The judge cited Hoelzle v. Fresno County (1958) 159 Cal.App.2d 478 and Muraco v. Don (App.3 Dist. 1926) 79 Cal.App. 738 in support of the ruling, stating that the requirement for "specific" denials is no longer part of the current statute.
