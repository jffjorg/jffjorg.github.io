And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the case. The defendant, Emanate Health Medical Center, argues that the plaintiff's allegations of elder abuse are insufficient because the plaintiff has not pleaded sufficient facts to establish authorization or ratification of the conduct of its staff. The judge agrees that the plaintiff has not met this requirement, citing a previous case, Covenant Care, Inc. v. Superior Court, which holds that pleading authorization or ratification with particularity is required for allegations of elder abuse.

The judge also notes that the plaintiff's allegations are based on circumstantial evidence and that the defendant is not disputing recklessness, but rather the plaintiff's failure to plead sufficient facts. The judge references other cases, including Hartman v. Shell Oil Co. and Worsham v. O'Connor Hospital, to support this ruling.

The judge's tentative ruling is that the plaintiff's allegations of elder abuse are insufficient and that the defendant's demurrer should be sustained.
