And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the plaintiff's motion to amend the judgment to include the name "Hrair George Tufenkdjian" as an additional alias of the judgment debtor. The plaintiff seeks to amend the judgment because it did not use the debtor's true name in the original suit. The debtor used the alias "Harayer G. Narsis" during the lease application process, but further investigation revealed that his true name is actually Hrair George Tufenkdjian. The court finds that the amendment is permissible under CCP section 187 and cites several cases that establish the authority of the court to impose liability on the true name of the judgment debtor.
