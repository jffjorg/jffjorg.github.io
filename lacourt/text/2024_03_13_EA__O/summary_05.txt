  - Motion: MOTION TO COMPEL BINDING ARBITRATION

Background:
  - Case is a lemon law case
  - Plaintiff filed suit on September 18, 2023
  - Defendant filed motion on November 6, 2023

Legal Standard:
  - California Code of Civil Procedure section 1281 et seq.

Discussion:
  - Issue is whether arbitration provision in Owner's Handbook & Warranty Information should be enforced
  - Defendant relies on contract principles, including doctrine of mutuality of obligation and lack of mutual assent
  - Plaintiff relies on Norcia v. Samsung Telecommunications Am. LLC, 845 F.3d 1279 (9th Cir. 2017)

Conclusion:
  - Motion DENIED for lack of mutual assent
  - Defendant failed to meet burden to establish that Plaintiff intended to assent to Handbook terms
  - Plaintiff was not informed about Handbook upon signing sales contract, did not receive Handbook, did not sign Handbook, and did not otherwise act in a manner to show intent to accept arbitration
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Hyundai Motor America, has moved to compel binding arbitration in this lemon law case. However, the court has denied the motion due to lack of mutual assent. The defendant argues that the plaintiff, Sara Pineda, agreed to the arbitration provision in the Owner's Handbook & Warranty Information, but the court finds that there is no evidence of mutual assent. The court notes that the handbook does not constitute a contract because it does not identify the parties, does not bear signatures, and does not set forth the good/vehicle at issue. Furthermore, the court finds that the plaintiff was not informed about the handbook upon signing the sales contract, did not receive the handbook, did not sign the handbook, and did not otherwise act in a manner to show intent to accept arbitration. The court relies on the Ninth Circuit's decision in Norcia v. Samsung Telecommunications Am. LLC, 845 F.3d 1279 (9th Cir. 2017), which held that the plaintiff's silence was not sufficient to demonstrate intent to accept an arbitration agreement. Therefore, the motion to compel arbitration is denied.
