And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied Defendant Marvin Urbina, M.D.'s motion for summary judgment. The motion was filed on November 9, 2023, and the opposition was filed on February 27, 2024. The Judge found that the declaration of Dr. Johnson, which was submitted in support of the motion, failed to meet the evidentiary requirements set forth in Kelley v. Trunk. Specifically, the declaration did not provide a reasoned explanation for the opinion expressed and did not address the issues of whether a physician in similar or like circumstances would have interpreted the symptoms differently or would have ordered a pelvic/abdominal CT scan earlier. As a result, the Judge found that there were triable issues of material fact as to standard of care and causation, and that the motion for summary judgment was denied.
