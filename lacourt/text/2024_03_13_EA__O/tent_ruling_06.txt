[1] For clarity, the
initial burden, and Defendant’s burden, is to establish that a valid contract
governs. (See Rosenthal v. Great W. Fin. Sec. Corp., 14 Cal.4th 394, 413, 58 Cal.Rptr.2d 875, 926 P.2d
1061 (1996) [The burden of proving the existence of an agreement
to arbitrate by a preponderance of the evidence rests on the moving party].) 
 


[2] Plaintiff also
argues she cannot read Spanish and negotiated the sale of the vehicle in
Spanish. However, the court is uncertain as to the persuasiveness of this
argument as Plaintiff is not contended that the sales contract (which she
presumably signed) was in English. To take her argument would then mean the
sales contract itself is likely unenforceable. (Plus, there is no analysis as
to unconscionability.)
