[1] Drs. Coen and Truong
have been dismissed. 
 


[2] Plaintiff filed a notice of
non-opposition “[b]ased upon discovery and evidence to date, the moving papers
and discussions with counsel [Defendant].” 
 


[3] Though Plaintiff has
filed a notice of non-opposition as to Dr. Copeli’s MSJ, a moving party’s
motion “may still not be granted unless his papers clearly establish that there
is no triable issue of fact.” (See Harman v. Mono General Hospital (1982)
131 Cal.App.3d 607, 612-613.) Accordingly, the court still needed to address
Dr. Copeli’s burden. 
 


[4] “The
determination of the expert's qualifications is ordinarily a matter addressed
to the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal
absent a clear showing of abuse.” (Chadock v. Cohn (1979) 96 Cal.App.3d
205, 208.)
 


[5] The court must consider “‘all of the inferences
reasonably drawn [from the evidence],’ and ‘must view such evidence [citation]
and such inferences [citations] ... in the light most favorable to the
opposing party.’” (Powell v. Kleinman (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 112,
120-121, quoting Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25
Cal.4th 826, 843 (Aguilar).)


[6] In comparison, see
declaration of Dr. Harvey D. Cohen (one of Plaintiff’s expert) which delineates
how Dr. Urbina allegedly breached standard of care (e.g., [“Given Mr.
Roybal’s history and symptomatology, the standard of care called for a stat
order CT with stat follow up and/or hospital admission.”], italics
original.)
