Moving Party: Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant
Oliver Damavandi
Resp. Party:    Defendants Michael J. Tisdale Construction,
Inc., Zachary Beer, Cardinal-West Construction, LLC, and Matthew George
 
 
The Motion is GRANTED in part. The Tisdale
Parties’ costs are TAXED by $1,328.60. Costs are AWARDED in favor of the
Tisdale Parties’ and against Oliver Damavandi in the total amount of $1,304.70.

 
PRELIMINARY
COMMENTS:
 
        As indicated below,
the Court is taxing certain costs. 
However, the Court questions the value of filing the Memorandum of
Costs, the Motion to Tax, and the Opposition. 
The Tisdale Parties claimed $2,633.30 in costs;
Plaintiff moved to tax the entire $2,633.30. 
However, on these two motions, the parties have probably spent at least
$2,600 in attorney's fees.  In other
words, both parties lost by filing – and opposing – this motion.
 
        Counsel should carefully
consider whether they are doing their clients a disservice by charging ahead
with litigation tactics that are not worth the candle.

ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal Standard
 
“Except as
otherwise expressly provided by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a
matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1032, subd. (b).)
 
Prevailing
parties seeking to claim costs must comply with California Rules of Court, rule
3.1700(a), and parties seeking to contest costs must comply with California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1700(b). 
 
II.       Discussion
 
A.      The
Parties’ Arguments
 
The Tisdale Parties claim $2,633.30 in costs,
which comprises of:
 
(1)       $1,304.70 in filing
and motion fees;
(2)       $837.50 in court
reporter fees; 
(3)       $411.90 in e-filing
fees; and
(4)       $79.20 in “other”
fees. 
 
(MC-010.)
 
        Oliver Damavandi moves the
Court to strike the Memorandum of Costs or, in the alternative, to tax and
disallow the costs claimed. (Motion, p. 10:2–3.) He argues: (1) that the Court
erred by entering judgment for the Tisdale Parties on June 6, 2023 due to the
one final judgment rule; (2) that the Tisdale Parties have not shown that they
themselves actually incurred and paid any costs; (3) that the filing, motion,
and e-filing fees were duplicative and overcharged; (4) that the court reporter
fees were not authorized; and (5) that the “other” costs are not authorized
here. (Id. at pp. 5:10, 7:24–25, 8:11, 10:1, 10:15.)
 
        The Tisdale Parties oppose
the Motion, arguing: (1) that the Court properly entered a final judgment as to
the Tisdale Parties; (2) that the costs incurred were necessary and reasonable;
(3) that the filing and motion costs are recoverable; (4) that the court reporter
fees are recoverable; and (5) that the “other” costs are “electronic filing
fees and delivery costs related to the delivery of courtesy copies as required
by the Court’s standing order.” (Opposition, pp. 2:11–12, 4:3, 4:16, 5:20–21,
6:5–6.)
 
        Oliver Damavandi
reiterates his arguments in his Reply. 
 
B.      Discussion
 
“It has long been the settled rule that in a case
involving multiple parties, a judgment is final and appealable when it leaves
no issues to be determined as to one party.” (Dakota Payphone, LLC v.
Alcaraz (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 493, 506, citation omitted.) That is the
case here, where the Court entered dismissal only as to the Tisdale Parties
because their demurrers to the FAC were sustained without leave to amend and no
issues remained for determination as to them. 
 
Plaintiff argues that the Tisdale parties did not themselves
incur the claimed costs.  However, it is
irrelevant who paid upfront for costs incurred in a litigation. The statute
allows “a prevailing party . . . to recover costs in any action or proceeding.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (b).) It is undisputed that the Tisdale
Parties, who are defendants in whose favor a dismissal was entered, are
indisputably the “prevailing party” here. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd.
(a)(4).) Thus, the Tisdale Parties are entitled to recover the costs they
incurred. 
 
Further, the Court agrees with the Tisdale
Parties that they did not need to file a single demurrer and were allowed to
file two demurrers. A review of these demurrers shows that they were extremely
similar but did contain slight differences when discussing defendant-specific
facts. In addition, the Tisdale Parties note correctly that the Standing Order
of Department 28 (the standing order of the department in which this case was heard
at the time most of these costs were incurred) does require courtesy copies in
accordance with General Order re Mandatory Electronic Filing. (Gov. Code, §§
70602.5, 70602.6, 70612; Standing Order of Dep’t 28, “Filings”; General Order
re Mandatory Electronic Filing for Civil, ¶ d.4.A.) Thus, while the Court
itself only requires $870.00 in costs for the filing of the two demurrers,
certain other costs relating to the demurrers were reasonable. However, the
Court will tax costs related to the notices of related case, as those did not
require e-filing costs, courtesy copies, or the other additional charges listed
on the invoices. (Opposition, Exh. A.) 
 
        The Court agrees with
Oliver Damavandi’s argument regarding court reporter fees. Such fees are
allowable as established by statute; the Tisdale Parties have not pointed to
any statute that specifically authorizes them. The Court will tax the court
reporter fees. 
 
        Finally, the “other” fees
are listed as “fees for lodging judgment.” (MC-010, Worksheet, Item 16.) The
Court agrees with Oliver Damavandi that this item should be taxed. 
 
The Court GRANTS in part the Motion. The
Tisdale Parties’ costs are TAXED by $1,328.60. Costs are AWARDED in favor of
the Tisdale Parties’ and against Oliver Damavandi in the total amount of
$1,304.70. 
 
III.     Conclusion
 
The Motion is GRANTED in part. The Tisdale
Parties’ costs are TAXED by $1,328.60. Costs are AWARDED in favor of the
Tisdale Parties’ and against Oliver Damavandi in the total amount of $1,304.70.
