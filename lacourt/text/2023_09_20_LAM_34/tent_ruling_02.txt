BACKGROUND:
 
On May 12, 2021,
Plaintiff Presciliano Contreras filed his Complaint against Defendants Kelly
Pipe Co., LLC, JFE Shoji America, LLC, JFE Shoji America Holdings, Inc., JFE
Shoji Steel American, Inc., R. Bourgeois JFE Shoji Magnetic Lamination, Inc.,
Art Shelton, Steve Livingston, and James Fiorillo. The causes of action arise
from Plaintiff’s employment with Defendants. 
 
On September 22,
2021, by stipulation of the Parties, the Court dismissed without prejudice
Defendants Art Shelton and Steve Livingston from the Complaint. 
 
On January 18, 2022,
by stipulation of the Parties, the Court dismissed without prejudice Defendants
JFE Shoji America, LLC, JFE Shoji America Holdings Inc., JFE Shoji Steel
America, Inc. (erroneously identified in the Complaint as JFE Shoji Steel
American, Inc.), and R. Bourgeois JFE Shoji Magnetic Lamination, Inc. from the
Complaint. 
 
On January 12, 2023,
the Court granted summary judgment in favor of Defendants and against Plaintiff
on the fifth and sixth causes of action in the Complaint. 
 
From June 12 to June
16, 2023, the Court held a jury trial in this matter. 
 
On June 16, 2023, the
Jury found in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant Kelly Pipe Co.
(“Defendant”) on all causes of action tried: (1) age discrimination; (2) age
harassment; (3) retaliation; (4) failure to prevent discrimination; (5)
wrongful termination; (6) whistleblower retaliation; and (7) intentional
infliction of emotional distress. The Jury further: (1) found a total of
$1,300,000.00 in damages; (2) found clear and convincing evidence that
Defendant acted with malice, oppression, or fraud; and (3) awarded $5,000,000.00
in punitive damages. 
 
On July 20, 2023,
Plaintiff filed: (1) Motion for an Order for Pre-Judgment Interest; and (2)
Motion for an Award of Attorneys’ Fees. With each of these motions, Plaintiff
concurrently filed a Proposed Order. In addition, for the Motion for an Award
of Attorneys’ Fees, Plaintiff also filed: (1) Request for Judicial Notice; (2)
Proposed Order for Request for Judicial Notice; (3) Appendix of Evidence; and
(4) Notice of Lodging Federal Authorities. 
 
On July 25, 2023,
Plaintiff filed his Judicial Council Form MC-010, Memorandum of Costs
(Summary). 
 
On July 25, 2023, the
Court entered Judgment in accordance with the Jury’s Verdict. 
 
On August 2, 2023,
Defendant filed: (1) Statement of Non-Opposition Re: Plaintiff’s Motion for an
Order for Pre-Judgment Interest; and (2) Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for
an Award of Attorneys’ Fees. In support of its Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion
for an Award of Attorneys’ Fees, Defendant concurrently filed: (1) Request for
Judicial Notice; (2) Declaration of Gary Scalabrini; (3) Declaration of Michael
W. Kelly; (4) Notice of Lodging Federal Authorities; and (5) Proof of Service. 
 
On August 8, 2023,
Plaintiff filed its Replies regarding the Motion for an Order for Pre-Judgment
Interest and the Motion for an Award of Attorneys’ Fees. 
 
On August 9, 2023,
Defendant filed: (1) Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict (“Motion

ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Motion
for JNOV
 
A. 
    Objection
and Request for Judicial Notice
 
Plaintiff objects to Defendant’s
Reply regarding the Motion for JNOV. Defendant argues that this Reply is timely
and files a Request for Judicial Notice regarding a trial order in another
case. 
 
The Court agrees with Defendant
that its Reply is timely. (Reply to Objection, p. 2:6–10.) Even if this Reply
were untimely, the Court would still consider it in the interests of justice. 
 
The Court DENIES as irrelevant the
Request for Judicial Notice. The Court OVERRULES the Objection. 
 
B. 
    Legal
Standard
 
“The court,
before the expiration of its power to rule on a motion for a new trial, either
of its own motion, after five days’ notice, or on motion of a party against
whom a verdict has been rendered, shall render judgment in favor of the
aggrieved party notwithstanding the verdict whenever a motion for a directed
verdict for the aggrieved party should have been granted had a previous motion
been made.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 629, subd. (a).)
 
“The trial judge’s power to grant a judgment notwithstanding
the verdict is identical to his power to grant a directed verdict. The trial
judge cannot weigh the evidence, or judge the credibility of witnesses. If the evidence is conflicting
or if several reasonable inferences may be drawn, the motion for judgment
notwithstanding the verdict should be denied.” (Hauter v. Zogarts
(1975) 14 Cal.3d 104, 110, citations omitted, scrivener’s error corrected.)
 
“A motion for
judgment notwithstanding the verdict of a jury may properly be granted only if
it appears from the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the party
securing the verdict, that there is no substantial evidence to support the
verdict. If there is any substantial evidence, or reasonable inferences to be
drawn therefrom, in support of the verdict, the motion should be denied.” (Brandenburg v. Pac. Gas & Elec. Co. (1946)
28 Cal.2d 282, 284, citations omitted.)
 
C. 
    Discussion
 
Defendant moves the Court for
judgment notwithstanding the Jury’s Verdict on: (1) the cause of action for
intentional infliction of emotional distress; and (2) punitive damages. (Motion
for JNOV, p. 17:11–12.)
 
Defendant argues that this would be
appropriate because: (1) Plaintiff presented no evidence of extreme and
outrageous conduct; (2) Plaintiff presented no evidence of reckless intent to
cause extreme emotional distress; (3) as a matter of law, punitive damages may
not be awarded here because there was not clear and convincing evidence of
malice, oppression, or fraud; and (4) the punitive damages award exceeded the
constitutional maximum. (Motion for JNOV, pp. 10:20–21, 12:14–15, 13:3, 15:15.)
 
Plaintiff opposes the Motion,
pointing to various pieces of evidence and arguing that Defendant’s cases are
inapposite. 
 
Defendant reiterates its arguments
in its Reply, as well as arguing against Plaintiff’s reading of case law. 
 
The Court disagrees with
Defendant’s arguments. 
 
First, Plaintiff presented evidence
of (1) extreme and outrageous conduct and (2) reckless intent to cause extreme
emotional distress. The Jury voted 12-0 in favor of Plaintiff on his cause of
action for wrongful termination; 11-1 in favor of Plaintiff on his cause of
action for age harassment; and 12-0 in favor of Plaintiff on his causes of
action for retaliation. The Jury was also unanimous in finding for Plaintiff on
his cause of action for IIED. 
 
There was sufficient evidence
presented to uphold each of these verdicts. In addition, Plaintiff’s expert
witness, Anthony Reading, testified that, as a result of Defendant’s conduct,
Plaintiff suffered an adjustment disorder with anxiety and major depressive
disorder. 
 
The Court need not, and will not,
recount all of the evidence. It is sufficient for a motion for judgment
notwithstanding the verdict that some substantial evidence supports the verdict
on these grounds. (Brandenburg, supra, 28 Cal.2d at p. 284.)
 
Second, there has been no evidence
presented to show that the jury failed to consider all of the evidence
presented to it by Plaintiff and Defendant. Based upon that evidence, the Jury
found clear and convincing evidence of malice, oppression, or fraud. Had this
been a Court trial, the Court might have found differently. But the Court
cannot weigh the evidence. (Hauter, supra, 14 Cal.3d at p. 110.)
It is sufficient to note that substantial evidence supports the verdict on this
ground. 
 
Finally, the Jury found
$1,300,000.00 in damages and, in the second, bifurcated part of the trial, awarded
Plaintiff $5,000,000.00 in punitive damages. The finding of clear and
convincing evidence was unanimous. Although the finding of $5,000,000.00 in
punitive damages was by a vote of 9-3, the Court has no evidence whether the
three dissenting votes would have imposed a higher or lower amount of punitive
damages. The punitive damages award is approximately 3.85 times larger than the
damages finding. While Defendant correctly notes that there are constitutional
limits on punitive damages awards, this punitive damages award does not approach
that limit. Further, in the punitive damages portion of the trial, evidence was
presented that Defendant had net sales of $1,000,000,000.00; a net worth in
2022 of $172,000,000.00; a net worth in 2023 of $136,000,000.00; and a
revolving loan of up to $160,000,000.00. Thus, substantial evidence supports
this punitive damages award. 
 
D. 
    Conclusion

 
The Motion for
JNOV is DENIED.
 
II.      
Motion
for New Trial
 
A. 
    Objection
and Request for Judicial Notice
 
Plaintiff objects to Defendant’s
Reply regarding the Motion for New Trial. Defendant argues that this Reply is
timely and files a Request for Judicial Notice regarding a trial order in
another case. 
 
The Court agrees with Defendant
that the Reply is timely. (Reply to Objection, p. 2:6–10.) Even if this Reply
were untimely, the Court would still consider it in the interests of justice. 
 
The Court DENIES as irrelevant the
Request for Judicial Notice. The Court OVERRULES the Objection.

    Legal
Standard
 
“A new trial is a re-examination of
an issue of fact in the same court after a trial and decision by a jury, court,
or referee.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 656.)
 
“The verdict may be vacated and any other
decision may be modified or vacated, in whole or in part, and a new or further
trial granted on all or part of the issues, on the application of the party
aggrieved, for any of the following causes, materially affecting the
substantial rights of such party: 
 
. . . 
 
“5. Excessive or inadequate damages.
 
“6. Insufficiency of the evidence to justify
the verdict or other decision, or the verdict or other decision is against law.
 
. . .
 
“When a new trial is granted, on all or part
of the issues, the court shall specify the ground or grounds upon which it is
granted and the court’s reason or reasons for granting the new trial upon each
ground stated.
 
“A new trial shall not be granted upon the
ground of insufficiency of the evidence to justify the verdict or other
decision, nor upon the ground of excessive or inadequate damages, unless after
weighing the evidence the court is convinced from the entire record, including
reasonable inferences therefrom, that the court or jury clearly should have
reached a different verdict or decision.
 
“The order passing upon and determining the
motion must be made and entered as provided in Section 660 and if the motion is
granted must state the ground or grounds relied upon by the court, and may
contain the specification of reasons. If an order granting such motion does not
contain such specification of reasons, the court must, within 10 days after
filing such order, prepare, sign and file such specification of reasons in
writing with the clerk. The court shall not direct the attorney for a party to
prepare either or both said order and said specification of reasons. . . .”
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 657.)
 
“In ruling on such motion, in a
cause tried without a jury, the court may, on such terms as may be just, change
or add to the statement of decision, modify the judgment, in whole or in part,
vacate the judgment, in whole or in part, and grant a new trial on all or part
of the issues, or, in lieu of granting a new trial, may vacate and set aside
the statement of decision and judgment and reopen the case for further
proceedings and the introduction of additional evidence with the same effect as
if the case had been reopened after the submission thereof and before a
decision had been filed or judgment rendered. Any judgment thereafter entered
shall be subject to the provisions of sections 657 and 659.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 662.)
 
C. 
    Discussion
 
Defendant moves the Court to grant
a new trial if Plaintiff refuses to consent to a remittitur correcting the
punitive damages award. (Motion for New Trial, p. 16:2–4.)
 
        Defendant
argues that this would be appropriate because: (1) the punitive damages award
is not supported by clear and convincing evidence; and (2) the punitive damages
award is excessive and unconstitutional under federal and state law. (Motion
for New Trial, pp. 10:7–8, 12:2–3.)
 
        Plaintiff
disagrees, arguing that the punitive damages award is supported by such
evidence and that the award is not excessive or unconstitutional. 
 
        Defendant
reiterates its arguments in its Reply. 
 
        The Court
disagrees with Defendant’s arguments. 
 
        In order for
the Court to grant a new trial upon the grounds of insufficiency of the
evidence or excessive damages, the Court must weigh the evidence and be
“convinced from the entire record, including reasonable inferences therefrom,
that the court or jury clearly should have reached a different verdict or
decision.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 657.)
 
        Upon weighing
the evidence submitted in this case, the Court is not convinced that the Jury
clearly should have reached a different verdict or decision. As seen by the
poll of the jury, different Jurors had different opinions on various causes of
action, and the Jurors did not consistently vote one way or another. (Minute
Order dated June 16, 2023, pp. 4–5.) However, the jury’s verdict, including its
award of $5,000,000.00 in punitive damages, was supported by substantial
evidence. The Court’s conclusion after reviewing the entire record, including
reasonable inferences therefrom, is that the jury’s verdict was sound.
 
D. 
    Conclusion

 
The Motion for
New Trial is DENIED. 
 
III.    
Motion
for an Order for Pre-Judgment Interest
 
A. 
    Legal
Standard
 
“A person who is entitled to recover damages
certain, or capable of being made certain by calculation, and the right to
recover which is vested in the person upon a particular day, is entitled also
to recover interest thereon from that day, except when the debtor is prevented
by law, or by the act of the creditor from paying the debt. . . .” (Civ. Code,
§ 3287, subd. (a).)
 
“Every person who is entitled under any
judgment to receive damages based upon a cause of action in contract where the
claim was unliquidated, may also recover interest thereon from a date prior to
the entry of judgment as the court may, in its discretion, fix, but in no event
earlier than the date the action was filed.” (Civ. Code, § 3287, subd. (b).)
 
B.      Discussion
 
Plaintiff requests that the Court
award: (1) pre-judgment interest at the rate of 7% per annum on the economic
damages award of $570,938.00 from June 6, 2020 to the date of entry of
judgment; and (2) pre-judgment interest at the rate of 10% per annum on the
noneconomic damages award of $729,062.00 from December 12, 2022 through
satisfaction of the judgment. (Motion for an Order for Pre-Judgment Interest,
p. 6:15–21.)
 
Defendant filed a Statement of
Non-Opposition, clarifying Plaintiff’s motion but not substantively opposing
it.  (See Statement of Non-Opposition,
filed 8/2/2023.) 
 
Plaintiff calculates the first set
of interest at $125,262.23 and the second set of interest at $44,942.18, for a
total amount of $170,204.41 in pre-judgment interest. (Reply regarding Motion
for an Order for Pre-Judgment Interest, p. 2:6–15.)
 
C. 
    Conclusion
 
The Motion for an Order for
Pre-Judgment Interest is GRANTED. 
 
Pre-Judgment interest is AWARDED in
favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of $170,204.41.

C. 
    Discussion
 
1. 
    The
Parties’ Arguments
 
Plaintiff moves the Court to award
$2,457,612.50 in attorneys’ fees, which would consist of: (1) $1,404,350.00 in
lodestar attorneys’ fees; and (2) a multiplier enhancement of 1.75 times the
lodestar (which itself would be $1,053,263.50). (Motion for an Award of
Attorneys’ Fees, pp. 11:13–14, 13:19.)
 
Plaintiff argues: (1) that as the
prevailing party, Plaintiff is entitled to attorneys’ fees under the Fair
Employment and Housing Act (“FEHA”); (2) that the size of the verdict should
not lessen the fee award; (3) that Plaintiff’s requested attorneys’ fees are
reasonable; and (4) that a multiplier of 1.75 times the lodestar is necessary
given the contingent risk, preclusion of other work, difficulty of questions
involved, and level of skill displayed in this litigation. (Motion for an Award
of Attorneys’ Fees, pp. 5:14, 6:1, 6:24, 11:15–16.)
 
 Defendant disagrees, arguing: (1) that an
award of attorneys’ fees is not mandatory; (2) that Plaintiff’s Counsel must
meet its burden to demonstrate the fees requested are reasonable; (3) that
Plaintiff’s lodestar is substantially based on 166 “trial preparation” entries
that cumulatively account for 1,030.5 attorney hours; (4) that if the Court
decides to award fees, the lodestar should be reduced significantly; and (5)
that the circumstances of this case do not justify a multiplier. (Opposition to
Motion for an Award of Attorneys’ Fees, pp. 5:12–13, 6:12–13, 8:23–24, 11:4.)
Defendant argues in the alternative that the Court should award $819,888.24 in
attorneys’ fees, which would consist of: (1) $803,812.00 in lodestar attorneys’
fees; and (2) a multiplier enhancement of 1.02 times the lodestar (which itself
would be $16,076.24). (Id. at p. 16:23–24.) 
 
        In his Reply,
Plaintiff argues: (1) that fee awards under FEHA should ordinarily be granted
as a matter of legislative purpose; (2) that Defendant’s misrepresentation of
authority underscores the need for a fee award; (3) that Defendant makes
misrepresentations and omissions from other fee awards; (4) that Plaintiff’s
entries are sufficient under the law; (5) that Defendant does not contest
Plaintiff’s requested hourly rates; and (6) that Defendant cannot overcome the
compelling interests in awarding a multiplier. (Reply regarding Motion for an
Award of Attorneys’ Fees, pp. 2:8–9, 2:22, 4:10, 7:3, 8:9, 8:17.)
 
2. 
    The
Prevailing Party 
 
a.  
    Legal
Standard
 
The relevant section of FEHA
“grants the trial court discretion to award attorney fees to a prevailing
party.” (Chavez v. City of Los Angeles (2010) 47 Cal.4th 970, 976.)
“This statute has been interpreted to mean that in a FEHA action a trial court
should ordinarily award attorney fees to a prevailing plaintiff unless special
circumstances would render a fee award unjust. (Ibid.)
 
b.  
    Discussion
 
Plaintiff is indisputably the
prevailing party here. The Jury found in favor of Plaintiff on all causes of
action tried; found clear and convincing evidence that Defendant acted with
malice, oppression, or fraud; and awarded punitive damages in favor of Plaintiff
and against Defendant. There are no circumstances here that would render a fee
award unjust. 
 
The Court exercises its discretion
here to award Plaintiff attorneys’ fees. (Gov. Code, § 12965, subd. (c)(6).)
 
3. 
    The
Method for Calculating Recovery
 
a.  
    Legal
Standard
 
“An attorney fee award under the
FEHA is designed to incentivize and reward a plaintiff's attorney in a civil
rights case. Trial courts first determine a lodestar amount: the hours spent
times a reasonable hourly rate. Courts may then increase the amount, usually by
applying a multiplier to the lodestar. The multiplier is to compensate for
extrinsic factors such as the risk of nonpayment (the contingency factor), the
public interest advanced by the case, the difficulty of the issues involved,
and the skill of the attorneys.” (Caldera v. Dep’t of Corr. & Rehab. (2020)
48 Cal.App.5th 601, 604, citing Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122,
1135.)
 
b.  
    Discussion
 
Although Defendant argues that no fees
should be awarded, neither Party disputes that the appropriate approach for
calculating recovery of attorneys’ fees is the lodestar adjustment method,
which involves multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended by the
reasonably hourly rate. (Caldera, supra, 48 Cal.App.5th at p.
604.) Nor do the Parties dispute that consideration of a multiplier is
appropriate, although Defendant argues that a multiplier is ultimately not
appropriate here. 
 
The Court uses the lodestar adjustment
method here and considers whether a multiplier is appropriate.  
 
4. 
    Reasonableness
of the Fees
 
a.  
    Legal
Standard
 
“[T]he reasonable value of attorney
services is variously defined as the hourly amount to which attorneys of like
skill in the area would typically be entitled.” (Ketchum, supra,
24 Cal.4th at p. 1133, citation and internal quotation marks omitted.)
 
“[A]bsent circumstances rendering
the award unjust, an attorney fee award should ordinarily include compensation
for all the hours reasonably spent, including those relating solely to
the fee.” (Ketchum, supra, at p. 1133, citation and emphases
omitted.) 
 
“The burden is
on the party seeking attorney fees to prove that the fees it seeks are
reasonable. However, in challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many
hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point
to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to
the evidence. General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative,
or unrelated do not suffice.” (Vines v. O’Reilly Auto Enters., LLC (2022)
74 Cal.App.5th 174, 184 [cleaned up].)
 
b.  
    Discussion
 
i.   
    The
Hourly Rates
 
Plaintiff claims: (1) that Counsel
Carney Shegerian charges $1,350.00 per hour; (2) that Counsel Anthony Nguyen
charges $1,100.00 per hour; (3) that Counsel Mahru Madjidi charges $900.00 per
hour; (4) that Counsel Bryan Kirsh charges $825.00 per hour; (5) that Counsel
Iris Salem charges $600.00 per hour; (6) that Counsel Allison Norder charges
$550.00 per hour; (7) that Counsel Kierston Yamamoto charges $450.00 per hour;
(8) that Counsel Zalman Robles charges $450.00 per hour; and (9) that Counsel
Thomas Rouston charges $450.00 per hour. (Motion for an Award of Attorneys’
Fees, p. 11:7–13.
 
Most, but not all, of the attorneys
that comprise Plaintiff’s Counsel provided declarations that help explain the
hourly rates they charge. (Appendix of Evidence: Decl. Shegerian, ¶ 7; Decl.
Nguyen, ¶ 10; Decl. Madjidi, ¶ 11; Decl. Kirsh, ¶ 4; Decl. Norder, ¶ 4; Decl.
Yamamoto, ¶ 4.) 
 
Counsel Shegerian has over 30 years
of experience practicing law and is considered, both by this Court and the
legal community, to be an exceptional trial attorney. Counsel Nguyen has nearly
15 years of experience practicing law and has previously appeared before this
Court.  Counsel Madjidi has 10 years of
experience practicing law. Counsel Kirsh has been an attorney for six years.
Counsel Norder (who has been an attorney for less than two years) and Counsel
Yamamoto (who has been an attorney for less than one year) are still
entry-level attorneys. The Court does not have any information for Counsel
Salem, Robles, or Rouston — even though Counsel Salem apparently charges more
than Counsel Norder and Yamamoto.
 
This Court
has previously granted Attorney Shegerian fees of $1,300/hour.  Understanding that top defense counsel who
are partners at major law firms charge up to $1,600/hour, the Court finds
Shegerian’s requested rate of $1,350/hour to be reasonable.  Based upon an evaluation of the declarations
submitted, the Court’s understanding of the prevailing rate for attorneys of
comparable skill and experience in the relevant community, and the Court’s
personal knowledge of the attorneys’ skills as presented in Court, the Court
lowers the hourly rates allowed to reasonable rates, as shown in the chart
below. 
 
ii.         
The
Number of Hours
 
Plaintiff’s Counsel Anthony Nguyen
declares that 1,755.5 hours of attorney time are sought in connection with this
case. (Reply regarding Motion for an Award of Attorneys’ Fees, Decl. Nguyen, ¶
14.)
 
Defendant specifically argues that
the 1,030.5 hours spent on “trial preparation” were excessive. (Opposition to
Motion for Award of Attorneys’ Fees, p. 6:12–13.) Defendant proposes that only
450 hours be allowed for trial preparation. (Id. at p. 9:11–14.)
Defendant does not make other arguments that specifically point to issues with
the hours sought by Plaintiff’s Counsel. 
 
        The Court
agrees with Defendant that 1,030.5 hours spent on trial preparation is
excessive, but only marginally so. This was a difficult, fact-intensive case.
There was no guarantee that Plaintiff would be successful in his claims, and
Plaintiff’s Counsel did an excellent job trying this case. The fact that
Defense Counsel only spent 376.2 hours on trial preparation in the three months
leading up to trial may have contributed to the jury’s verdict. 
 
The Court will lessen the hours of
Counsel Madjidi, Nguyen, and Norder by 75 hours, 50 hours, and 25 hours,
respectively, in rough accordance with their proportionate hours spent on trial
preparation. (Opposition to Motion for Award of Attorneys’ Fees, p. 6:13–22.)
 
        The Court will
grant the other hours sought, as Plaintiff has met his initial burden of proof
on those hours and Defendant has not met its subsequent burden to show that
those hours should be reduced.
 
5. 
    Multiplier
to the Lodestar
 
a.  
    Legal
Standard
 
“The purpose
of the multiplier is to reward the prevailing attorney with an increased fee in
light of the extrinsic Ketchum factors: the importance and difficulty of the litigation;
the novelty of the issues involved; the risk of nonpayment for the attorney's
services (the contingency factor); the skill of the attorney in presenting the
case; and the magnitude of the results obtained.” (Caldera, supra,
48 Cal.App.5th at p. 607, citing Ketchum, supra, 24 Cal.4th at
pp. 1132–34.)
 
“Of course, the trial court is not required to include a fee enhancement to the basic
lodestar figure for contingent risk, exceptional skill, or other factors,
although it retains discretion to do so in the appropriate case; moreover, the
party seeking a fee enhancement bears the burden of proof.” (Ketchum, supra,
24 Cal.4th at p. 1138, emphasis omitted.)
 
b.  
    Discussion
 
Plaintiff requests a multiplier
enhancement of 1.75. (Motion for Award of Attorneys’ Fees, p. 11:15–16.)
 
Defendant argues that there should
be no multiplier, or in the alternative only a multiplier or 1.02. (Opposition
to Motion for Award of Attorneys’ Fees, pp. 11:4–5, 16:19–20.)
 
For the reasons listed below, the
Court finds that Plaintiff meets his burden regarding a multiplier enhancement.

 
First, Plaintiff’s Counsel took
this case on complete contingency. (Reply regarding Motion for Award of
Attorneys’ Fees, Decl. Nguyen, ¶ 16.) “The adjustment to the lodestar figure,
e.g., to provide a fee enhancement reflecting the risk that the attorney will
not receive payment if the suit does not succeed, constitutes earned
compensation; unlike a windfall, it is neither unexpected nor fortuitous.
Rather, it is intended to approximate market-level compensation for such
services, which typically includes a premium for the risk of nonpayment or
delay in payment of attorney fees.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24
Cal.4th 1122, 1138; accord Amaral v. Cintas Corp. No. 2 (2008) 163
Cal.App.4th 1157, 1217–18 and Taylor v. Nabors Drilling USA, LP (2014)
222 Cal.App.4th 1228, 1252.) 
 
FEHA cases are based on statutes
that are designed to protect the California consumer. If a plaintiff’s attorney
is paid no more than the lodestar, “competent counsel will be reluctant to
accept fee award cases.” (Ketchum, supra, 24 Cal.4th at p. 1133,
quotation and internal quotation marks omitted.)¿ 
 
Second, the vast amount of hours
reasonably incurred on this matter clearly precluded other work by Plaintiff’s
Counsel. 
 
Third, discussed earlier in this
Order, three members of Plaintiff’s Counsel are very experienced, two of whom
spent a significant amount of time on this case. Although the most experienced
lawyer on the team (Counsel Shegerian) only spent 4.4 hours on this matter,
Counsel Nguyen and Madjidi (who each spent hundreds of hours on this matter)
are highly-skilled trial attorneys. 
 
Fourth, there was a significant
chance that Defendant would have prevailed on each of the causes of action.
This was apparent from the motion for summary judgment filed in this matter, in
which the Court granted summary judgment against Plaintiff on two causes of action
(breach of express oral contract and breach of implied contract). 
 
Fifth, Plaintiff’s Counsel achieved
excellent results for their client. Plaintiff succeeded on all causes of action
tried, obtained $1,300,000.00 in damages, and obtained $5,000,000.00 in
punitive damages. The Court has no problem concluding that these results are
significantly higher than they would have been without counsel of comparable
skill and experience. 
 
Sixth, in contrast to Defense
Counsel, who presumably gets paid monthly, Plaintiff’s Counsel have not
been paid for the more than two years that this action has been
pending.  The normal interest rate in California is 10%, which is the
equivalent of a 1.10 multiplier. Because not all of an attorney’s work occurs
at the beginning of any given year, the Court assumes that the work was
performed more-or-less evenly throughout the course of any given year. This
means a 1.05 multiplier per year is appropriate to compensate
Plaintiff’s Counsel for the time-value of the money that they would have
been paid monthly had the case not been contingent.¿ 
 
Plaintiff’s Counsel litigated
this case from May 2021 through September 2023 without payment. However,
at oral argument, it was indicated Plaintiff’s counsel’s work was not evenly
distributed over the past 2½ years; rather, most of it was performed during the
past year. In consideration of this delay and that the statutes under which
Plaintiff sued were designed to protect workers, the Court would award a
1.075 multiplier
to the lodestar indicated above just to compensate for the time value of money.
This multiplier would compensate Plaintiff’s Counsel for the time
value of the money they would have been paid monthly had the case not been
contingent.  
 
        Finally, FEHA cases are unfortunately necessary for upholding
the public interest. Race and age discrimination occur far too often in our
society; often such discrimination is not remedied. Our courts have long
recognized the “need to encourage [attorneys] willing to challenge injustices
in our society” and that “[a]dequate fee awards are perhaps the most effective
means of achieving this salutary goal.” (Etcheson
v. FCA US LLC, (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 831, 849, quoting Thayer v. Wells Fargo Bank,
N.A. (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th
819, 839.)  For that reasons, Courts
should not be “unduly parsimonious in the calculation of such fees.” (Thayer
v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2001)
92 Cal.App.4th 819, 839.)
 
The Court will award a multiplier enhancement
of 1.575, which this Court finds appropriate given the factors considered
above. 
 
D. 
    Conclusion
 
The Motion for Award of Attorneys’
Fees is GRANTED in part.
 
Attorneys’ fees are granted in the
total amount of $1,649,261.25. This comprises of a lodestar of $1,047,150.00
and a multiplier of 1.575, as shown in the spreadsheet below.
