## English Summary

The tentative ruling addresses a motion filed by Oliver Damavandi to strike or tax costs claimed by defendants Michael J. Tisdale Construction, Inc., Zachary Beer, Cardinal-West Construction, LLC, and Matthew George (the "Tisdale Parties"). 

The Court acknowledges that the Tisdale Parties are the prevailing parties in the case and are entitled to recover costs. However, the Court finds that certain costs claimed by the Tisdale Parties are not allowable under California law and rules. Specifically, the Court is taxing $1,328.60 from the Tisdale Parties' total cost claim of $2,633.30.

The Court also expresses concern that both parties spent significant time and money on these motions, which ultimately did not benefit either side. The Court encourages counsel to carefully consider the costs and benefits of litigation strategies before pursuing them. 

Ultimately, the Court awards the Tisdale Parties $1,304.70 in costs.
