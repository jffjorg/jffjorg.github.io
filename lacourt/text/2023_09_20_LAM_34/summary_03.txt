## English Summary:

The judge has reviewed a motion for a "good faith settlement" filed by Defendant Flexcor Construction Services. This means Flexcor wants the court to decide if their agreement with the Plaintiff, Lewis Hollman, to settle the case was fair and reasonable. 

The key facts are:

* Hollman sued Flexcor and several other companies for damage caused by a mudslide. 
* Flexcor settled with Hollman, agreeing to dismiss the case against them in exchange for Hollman dropping their claim for costs.

Flexcor argues that the settlement was reached fairly and honestly, without any collusion or attempts to harm the other defendants.  The judge agrees, finding that there is no evidence to suggest the settlement was not in good faith.  Therefore, the judge grants Flexcor's motion, meaning the other defendants in the case cannot pursue claims against Flexcor based on this settlement.
