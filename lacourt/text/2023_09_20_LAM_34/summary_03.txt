And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion for good faith settlement filed by defendant Flexcor Construction Services. The motion was unopposed and the court found that the settlement between the plaintiff and defendant Flexcor Construction Services was reached in good faith. The settlement was the result of arm's length negotiations between the parties and there was no evidence to suggest that it was entered into through collusion, fraud, or other tortious conduct. The court found that the settlement was entered into in good faith and therefore precludes other joint tortfeasors from pursuing claims against defendant Flexcor Construction Services.
