II.      
ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiff has not correctly calculated two figures. 
 
        First, regarding prejudgment interest,
the allegations indicate that these damages (based on common counts) were
liquidated as of December 18, 2022. (Complaint, ¶ 9.) The Declaration of Edna
Kamjoo supports these allegations, and thus prejudgment interest for the common
counts is allowed as of that date. (Notably, prejudgment is only allowed for
damages on the common counts, and not for the fourth cause of action, in which
Plaintiff is receiving statutory damages pursuant to Civil Code section 1719. [Imperial
Merch. Servs., Inc. v. Hunt (2009) 47 Cal.4th 381, 398.].) However, the
Declaration in support of interest calculations makes minor rounding errors.
The amount of prejudgment interest is actually $5,342.79, not $5,344.63.
 
        Second, regarding treble damages
pursuant to Civil Code section 1719, the amount requested is $4,500.00. The
statute states in relevant part:
 
“If this person fails to pay in full the amount of the check,
the service charge payable to the payee, and the costs to mail the written
demand within this period, this person shall then be liable instead for the
amount of the check, minus any partial payments made toward the amount of the
check or the service charge within 30 days of the written demand, and damages
equal to treble that amount, which shall not be less than one hundred dollars
($100) nor more than one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500).” (Civ. Code, §
1719, subd. (a)(2).)
 
The statutory damages clause states “which shall not be less than one
hundred dollars ($100) nor more than one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500).”
This clause refers to the word “damages” in the immediately preceding clause,
which means that the maximum amount of statutory damages is $1,500.00. 
 
Dictum from our Supreme Court supports this interpretation of the
clause.  “In 1995, the Legislature . . .
increased the treble damages cap from $500 to $1,500.” (See Imperial Merch.
Servs., Inc., supra, 47 Cal.4th at p. 391].) 
 
        The Court GRANTS in part the Request for
Default Judgment. Judgment is awarded in favor of Plaintiff and against
Defendants, jointly and severally, in the total amount of $100,990.48. This
consists of $92,422.69 in damages, $5,342.79 in prejudgment interest on
damages, $1,500.00 in statutory damages, $1,200.00 in attorney’s fees, and
$525.00 in costs, as indicated in the spreadsheet below:
