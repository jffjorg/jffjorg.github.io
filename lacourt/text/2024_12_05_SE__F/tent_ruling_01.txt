  Case Number:  23NWCV02694    Hearing Date:   December 5, 2024    Dept:  F Celaya v. Silva, et al. 23NWCV02694
 
This personal injury action was filed on August 8, 2023.
Trial is currently scheduled to begin on January 7, 2025. Defendants move ex
parte for an order to Continue Trial Date and Final Status Conference Date due
to a significant, unanticipated change in the case. During a mediation on
November 12, 2024, it was disclosed that Plaintiff requires a shoulder surgery,
and Defendants have yet to receive relevant medical records. Additionally,
Defendants state their expert Dr. Srinivas is not available to testify between
January 9, 2025, to January 13, 2025. In opposition, Plaintiffs contend there
are inconsistencies in Defendant’s declarations regarding expert availability
but agree to a trial continuance of no longer than 30 days.
 
Defendants’ request to Continue Trial Date and Final Status
Conference is GRANTED pursuant to California Rules of Court rule
3.1332(c)(7) – a significant, unanticipated change in the status of the case as
a result of which the case is not ready for trial. A continuance for a trial
date on or after February 25, 2025, is reasonable. The Court will confer with
the parties to select a new trial date. The discovery cut-off will track the
new trial date. Moving Party to give notice.
