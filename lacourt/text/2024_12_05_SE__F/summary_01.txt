And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling in the case of F Celaya v. Silva, et al. (Case Number 23NWCV02694) grants the defendants' request to continue the trial date and final status conference date due to a significant and unanticipated change in the case. The change is the result of a mediation on November 12, 2024, where it was disclosed that the plaintiff requires a shoulder surgery and the defendants have yet to receive relevant medical records. Additionally, the defendants' expert, Dr. Srinivas, is not available to testify between January 9, 2025, and January 13, 2025. The parties agree to a trial continuance of no longer than 30 days, and the Judge will confer with the parties to select a new trial date. The discovery cut-off will track the new trial date.
