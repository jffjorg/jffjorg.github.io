And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's ex parte application to continue the mandatory settlement conference (MSC) and trial date. This decision is based on the addition of a new defendant, who has not yet been served and has not had a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial. The new MSC date is set for January 2025, and the new trial date is set for September 2025. The judge will confer with the parties to select the new dates and the discovery cutoff date will correspond with the new trial date.
