And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a lemon law case, Nicholas Schwarcz v. General Motors LLC. The plaintiff bought a 2022 Chevrolet Colorado, but claims the vehicle has a defect in its 8 speed automatic transmission, causing harsh shifts and transmission slipping. The defendant has filed a demurrer to the fraud claim, arguing that the plaintiff did not plead fraud with particularity and did not allege a transactional relationship between the parties. The defendant has also moved to strike the punitive damages claim, arguing that the underlying fraud claim fails and the plaintiff has no basis to seek punitive damages. Instead of filing an opposition, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint, which moots the demurrer and motion to strike. The court has overruled the demurrer and denied the motion to strike as moot.
