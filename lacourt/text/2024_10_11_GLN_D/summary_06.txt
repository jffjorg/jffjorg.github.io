And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in a hearing on a claim of exemption from the enforcement of a judgment. The judgment creditor, States Resources Corp., has filed a notice of opposition to the claim of exemption, and the court will hear argument on the matter. The court notes that the judgment creditor has not filed an acknowledgment of assignment of judgment, as required by CCP section 673, and that the claim of exemption relies on CCP sections 704.070 and 706.051, which do not apply in this case since there have been no attempts to levy on the judgment debtor's bank accounts or wages. The court finds that the judgment debtor has failed to establish any entitlement to relief in this court and denies the claim of exemption. The court will hear further argument on procedures necessary to formalize the claimed status of States Resources Corp. as the judgment creditor.
