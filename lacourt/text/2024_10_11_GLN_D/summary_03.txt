And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of defendant Rodolfo Mejia. The defendant is ordered to appear for deposition and give testimony by remote video appearance on November 15, 2024 at 9:00 a.m. The request for production of documents at deposition is denied without prejudice to plaintiff serving a notice of deposition which includes permissible document requests. The defendant is also ordered to serve any objections or move for a protective order in a timely manner.

The court notes that the defendant's opposition primarily targets the issue of sanctions, but the moving papers do not seek sanctions and do not provide the necessary information to award sanctions. Therefore, no sanctions are awarded.

The court also notes that the plaintiff's motion does not include a copy of the deposition notice, which makes it difficult to determine what documents are at issue. The court orders the plaintiff to serve a notice of deposition, including permissible document requests, no later than October 25, 2024.

Finally, the court reminds the parties that they may use LACourtConnect for remote appearances and encourages them to make arrangements in advance.
