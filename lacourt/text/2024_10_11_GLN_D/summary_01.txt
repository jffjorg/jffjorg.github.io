```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motions to quash deposition subpoenas directed to Gabriel Tashchyan and Vartan Tashchyan, and has found that the service of the subpoenas was ineffective. The court has no personal jurisdiction over the third-party witnesses. As a result, the motions to quash the subpoenas are granted, and the deposition subpoenas are quashed. The requests for protective orders are denied as premature, as the witnesses have not been properly served with a subpoena requiring their attendance or production of documents. Sanctions are also denied.
