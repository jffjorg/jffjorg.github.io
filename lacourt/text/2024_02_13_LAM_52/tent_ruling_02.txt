 Case Number:  23STCV09772    Hearing Date:   February 13, 2024    Dept:  52 Non-Appearance Case Review Re:
Default Judgment
Plaintiff Antonio Alexander Acosta Juarez requests court judgment by default
against defendants DB & JB Construction Inc dba DB Construction and Douglas
E. Bracamonte.  Plaintiff’s application
for default judgment has five defects.
1. Judgment Exceeds Amount
Demanded by Complaint
Plaintiff
requests judgment for relief exceeding the amount demanded in the
complaint.  “A default judgment greater
than the amount specifically demanded in the complaint is void as beyond the
court’s jurisdiction.”  (Airs
Aromatics, LLC v. CBL Data Recovery Technologies, Inc. (2018) 23
Cal.App.5th 1013, 1018.)  “Where no
amount of damages is demanded any amount awarded is by definition greater than
the amount demanded.”  (Falahati v.
Kondo (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 823, 830–831.)
Plaintiff requests a judgment of $216,766.50 including
$200,000 in damages.  The first amended
complaint does not demand or allege any specific amount of damages.  It prays “For damages according to proof”,
“For general unpaid wages”, “For general damages”, and “For other special
damages.”  (FAC, p. 23.)  The judgment plaintiff requests thus exceeds
the amount demanded.  The court cannot
grant it.
To recover damages, plaintiff must file a second
amended complaint.  Filing an amended
complaint vacates defendants’ defaults. 
After a plaintiff “file[s] an amended complaint praying for a different
amount of damages and/or other appropriate relief… she must serve her amended
complaint on defendants, who will be entitled to file a new answer; all issues
will then be at large, including liability.” 
(Greenup v. Rodman (1986) 42 Cal.3d 822, 830; accord Airs
Aromatics, LLC v. CBL Data Recovery Technologies, Inc. (2018) 23
Cal.App.5th 1013, 1025 [filing amended complaint vacates default].)  The amended complaint must be served in the
manner of a summons.  (Engebretson & Co. v. Harrison (1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 436,
444.)
2. Insufficient Factual
Allegations Against Douglas E. Bracamonte
Plaintiff’s
first amended complaint does not allege sufficient facts to constitute its
causes of action against Douglas E. Bracamonte. 
“Under the ‘well pleaded’ complaint rule, it is error to enter a default
judgment on a complaint that fails to state a cause of action against the
defaulting defendant.”  (Ferraro v.
Camarlinghi (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 509, 539.)  Where “the liability of the individual
defendants” relies “upon disregard of the corporate entity by application of
the alter ego doctrine,” a complaint’s “bare conclusory allegation[s]” are
insufficient for a default judgment against the individuals.  (Vasey v. California Dance Co. (1977)
70 Cal.App.3d 742, 748-749.)  
The
first amended complaint alleges six causes of action for violations of the
Labor Code and two causes of action for violations of the Fair Employment and
Housing Act.  It alleges, “Plaintiff was
employed by Defendants DB & JB Construction Inc.”  (FAC, ¶ 1.) 
It alleges Bracamonte was “the owner” of the business.  (¶ 18.) 
It does not allege Bracamonte employed plaintiff.  It alleges no basis for finding Bracamonte
vicariously liable for the conduct of plaintiff’s employer.  It does not include even conclusory
allegations that would make Bracamonte liable as an individual for violating
the Labor Code or Fair Employment and Housing Act.  
3. Interest
            Plaintiff
seeks $4,500 in prejudgment interest.  An
application for default judgment must include “[i]nterest computations as
necessary.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a)(3).)  Plaintiff’s papers do not
explain the basis or the computations supporting $4,500 in prejudgment
interest.  
Moreover,
prejudgment interest is generally available when the amount of damages is
certain as of a particular day.  (Civ.
Code § 3287(a) [“A person who is entitled to recover damages certain, or
capable of being made certain by calculation, and the right to recover which is
vested in the person upon a particular day, is entitled also to recover
interest thereon from that day”].)  Plaintiff
does not allege damages that were certain or capable of being made certain by
calculation and vested on a particular day. 

4. Declaration of Non-Military
Status
            Plaintiff
did not include a sworn declaration of defendants’ nonmilitary status.  An application for default judgment must
include “[a] declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom
judgment is sought.”  (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1800(a)(5); see Form CIV-100, § 8.) 
5. Doe Defendants
            Finally,
plaintiff did not request dismissal of defendants Does 1-10.  An application for default judgment must
include “[a] dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an
application for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil
Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each
judgment.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a)(7).)  Plaintiff does not seek default judgment
against the Doe defendants and therefore must dismiss them.
Disposition
Plaintiff’s request for court judgment by default is
denied.  Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 473(a)(1), the court hereby grants plaintiff leave
to file a second amended complaint to demand a specific amount of damages.
