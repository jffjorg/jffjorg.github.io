And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that defendants Compton Car Wash, Inc. and Abrahim Aminpour's motion to set aside their defaults and default judgment against them is granted. The court finds that defendants' counsel, Ophir J. Bitton, had a valid excuse for his failure to receive reminders about the case, and that plaintiff's counsel, Kyle J. Ignatius, failed to warn Bitton of his intent to seek a default. The court also finds that Ignatius failed to communicate with Bitton after their phone call, and that Bitton was entitled to expect that Ignatius would communicate with him, not his clients. The judge orders that the defaults and default judgment against defendants be vacated, and that defendants file their proposed answer forthwith.
