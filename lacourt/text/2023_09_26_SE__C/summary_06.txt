##  English Summary

The judge is tentatively ruling in favor of the defendants (Zimmer US, Inc., Zimmer, Inc., Zimmer Biomet, and Biomet, Inc.) in their motion to strike the plaintiff's claim for punitive damages. 

The judge acknowledges that the plaintiff's allegations about the defendants knowing the implants were prone to failure could potentially support a claim for malicious conduct. However, the judge finds that the complaint is insufficient because it doesn't allege that the defendants' corporate entities ratified this alleged malicious conduct. 

The plaintiff is given 10 days to amend their complaint to address this issue.
