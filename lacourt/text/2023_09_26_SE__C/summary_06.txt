Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike punitive damages brought by defendants Zimmer US, Inc., Zimmer, Inc., Zimmer Biomet, and Biomet, Inc. The motion was granted with 10 days' leave to amend. The court found that the plaintiff's punitive damages allegations, while alleging that the defendants knew or should have known that the implant device was prone to failure, did not rise to the level of despicable or malicious conduct. The court noted that the allegations did suggest that the defendants engaged in despicable conduct with a conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others, but the plaintiff failed to allege corporate ratification. The court granted the motion to strike punitive damages and gave the plaintiff 10 days to amend its complaint to allege corporate ratification.
