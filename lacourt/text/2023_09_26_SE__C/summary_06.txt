**English Summary:**

The judge tentatively rules that the defendants' motion to strike punitive damages from the plaintiff's complaint is granted, but with leave to amend within 10 days. The judge finds that the plaintiff's allegations regarding the defendants' knowledge of the implant's potential failure are sufficient to allege malicious conduct. However, the complaint lacks an allegation of corporate ratification, which is necessary to support a claim for punitive damages.  The plaintiff is given an opportunity to amend the complaint to address this deficiency.
