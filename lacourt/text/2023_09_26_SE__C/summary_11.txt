And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's ex parte application for terminating and monetary sanctions for discovery abuse in the alternative. The court will shorten the time for the plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions. The decision is based on the discovery of inconsistencies in the initial statements made by the defendants, who had claimed that Cole, a dog, had never attacked or bitten anyone. However, it was later discovered that Cole had actually attacked and/or bitten at least three people, including two children, causing significant and permanent injuries. The court has granted the motion to ensure that the plaintiff is not irreparably harmed by being forced to proceed to trial without having this motion heard. The motion for terminating sanctions has been advanced to November 7, 2023, at 10:30 am in Dept. C.
