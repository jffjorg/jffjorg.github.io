The court has granted the motion to ensure that the plaintiff is not irreparably harmed by being forced to proceed to trial without having this motion heard.

## English Text Summary

The judge is leaning towards granting the Plaintiff's request to terminate the case and impose monetary sanctions on the Defendants. 

This decision stems from the Defendants' initial false statements during discovery regarding the history of their dog, Cole. The Plaintiff later discovered that Cole had a history of biting people, including children, causing serious injuries.

The judge recognizes the approaching five-year statute of limitations and believes that the Plaintiff would suffer irreparable harm if forced to proceed to trial without having this motion heard.  

Therefore, the judge is advancing the hearing date for the motion for terminating sanctions from February 8, 2024, to November 7, 2023.
