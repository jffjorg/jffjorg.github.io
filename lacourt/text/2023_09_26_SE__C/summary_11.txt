The court has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's ex parte application for terminating and monetary sanctions for discovery abuse in the alternative. The court will shorten the time for the plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions. The decision is based on the discovery of inconsistencies in the initial statements made by the defendants, who had claimed that Cole, a dog, had never attacked or bitten anyone. However, it was later discovered that Cole had actually attacked and/or bitten at least three people, including two children, causing significant and permanent injuries. The court has granted the motion to ensure that the plaintiff is not irreparably harmed by being forced to proceed to trial without having this motion heard. The motion for terminating sanctions has been advanced to November 7, 2023, at 10:30 am in Dept. C.

The judge shortened the time frame for the plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions, originally set for February 8, 2024, to November 7, 2023.



This ruling indicates that the judge believes the defendants acted in bad faith by misleading the plaintiff during discovery.  The plaintiff will now have the opportunity to argue for the full termination of the case against the defendants due to this discovery abuse.
