Moving
Parties to give NOTICE.
 
 
Defendants Eat Fresh,
LLC and Subway Restaurants, LLC demur to the 1st
-3rd and 5th causes of action on the grounds that they
fail to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and are
uncertain.
 
The Complaint alleges that “[o]n May 31, 2021,
Plaintiff, a pregnant young woman, was dining inside Defendants' PREMISES, and
unbeknownst to Plaintiff, one of the chairs inside Defendants' PREMISES was
defective, and as Plaintiff sat down on one of those chairs, the
("CHAIR") 'collapsed" and as a result Plaintiff fell onto the
hard floor.”  (Complaint, ¶ 11.)  Based thereon, the Complaint asserts causes
of action for:
 
1.       
Strict
Products Liability
2.       
Breach
of Express and Implied Warranties
3.       
Negligence
based on Defective Product
4.       
Negligence
and Premises Liability
5.       
Negligence
based on Violation of OSHA
 
1st
– 3rd and 5th CAUSES OF ACTION
 
STRICT PRODUCTS LIABILITY, BREACH OF EXPRESS
AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES, and NEGLIGENCE BASED ON DEFECTIVE PRODUCT:
 
“A manufacturer, distributor, or retailer is
liable in tort if a defect in the manufacture or design of its product causes injury
while the product is being used in a reasonably foreseeable way.”  (Soule v. General Motors Corp. (1994)
8 Cal.4th 548, 560.)
 
Defendants contend that they do not sell
chairs, and therefore are not manufacturers, sellers, and/or distributors in
the chain of distribution.  Judicial
Notice is taken of Eat Fresh, LLC’s Statement of Liability filed with the State
of California provides its type of business as “Operating Subway Restaurants.”
(Dailo Dec. ¶4, Exb. B.)  Subway
Restaurants, LLC’s filed with the State of California provides its type of
business as “Real Estate.” (Dailo Dec. ¶4, Exb. B)  Neither entity are sellers of chairs.  Therefore, the causes of actions concerning
the product are inapplicable.
 
In opposition, Plaintiff contends that Subway
is a “retailer,” citing Soule v. General
Motors Corp. (1994) 8 Cal.4th 548.  However, in the portion cited, Soule
referenced Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, Inc. (1963) 59 Cal.2d 57,
which involves a “retailer” of the sold defective good.  Here, Defendants did not sell Plaintiff the
allegedly defective chair.  Therefore,
Defendants are not part of the chain of distribution subject to products
liability.  Like Plaintiff, Defendants’
restaurant is the end-user of the chair, not part of the chain of distribution.
 
The injury suffered by Plaintiff is one for
negligence and premises liability, which Defendants did not demur to.
 
Accordingly, the demurrer is SUSTAINED with 10
days leave to amend as to the 1st – 3rd and 5th
causes of action.
 
Motion to strike punitive damages is GRANTED
with 10 days leave to amend.  The
Complaint fails to allege facts supporting malicious or despicable conduct.
