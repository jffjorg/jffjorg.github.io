**Case Number:** 22NWCV00913
**Hearing Date:** September 26, 2023
**Dept:** C
**Plaintiff:** Lopez
**Defendants:** Eat Fresh, LLC and Subway Restaurants, LLC

The tentative ruling for the hearing on September 26, 2023, finds that the demurrer of Defendants Eat Fresh, LLC and Subway Restaurants, LLC to Plaintiff's complaint is sustained with 10 days leave to amend. Additionally, Defendants' motion to strike is granted with 10 days leave to amend.

The case concerns Plaintiff Lopez, a pregnant woman who allegedly fell and was injured while sitting on a defective chair at one of Defendants' premises on May 31, 2021. Plaintiff has brought causes of action for Strict Products Liability, Breach of Express and Implied Warranties, Negligence based on Defective Product, Negligence and Premises Liability, and Negligence based on Violation of OSHA.

Defendants argue that they are not manufacturers, sellers, or distributors of chairs and, thus, cannot be held liable under the first three and fifth causes of action. Judicial notice has been taken of Eat Fresh, LLC's Statement of Liability, which states its business as operating Subway Restaurants. Subway Restaurants, LLC's filing with the State of California provides its type of business as real estate. Neither entity sells chairs.

Plaintiff argues that Subway is a "retailer," citing Soule v. General Motors Corp. However, the court finds that Defendants did not sell Plaintiff the allegedly defective chair and are not part of the chain of distribution subject to products liability.

The court sustains the demurrer as to the first, second, third, and fifth causes of action and grants the motion to strike punitive damages. Plaintiff is given 10 days to amend the complaint.
