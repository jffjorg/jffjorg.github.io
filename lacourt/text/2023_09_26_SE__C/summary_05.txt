And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint is sustained with 10 days leave to amend. The defendants' motion to strike punitive damages is also granted with 10 days leave to amend. The plaintiff alleges causes of action for Strict Products Liability, Breach of Express and Implied Warranties, and Negligence based on Defective Product, but the Judge finds that the defendants are not liable as they did not sell the allegedly defective chair and are not part of the chain of distribution. The Judge notes that the injury suffered by the plaintiff is one for negligence and premises liability, which the defendants did not demur to.
