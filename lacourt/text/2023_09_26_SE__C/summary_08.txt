Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Sanchez v. EOS Fitness, LLC, et al. The defendants have demurred to the plaintiff's first amended complaint, alleging that the causes of action fail to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and are uncertain. The Judge has sustained the demurrer with 10 days leave to amend.

The plaintiff alleges that his gym membership was cancelled due to racial discrimination and harassment. However, the Judge notes that the plaintiff provides no facts supporting any such "racial" discrimination. The Judge also finds that the conduct complained of (i.e. cancelling the plaintiff's gym membership) does not rise to the level of outrageous conduct.

The Judge also finds that the defendants' motion to strike is moot in light of the grant of leave to amend.

Overall, the Judge's tentative ruling suggests that the plaintiff will need to provide more specific and factual allegations in order to state a cause of action.

## English Summary:

The judge has tentatively ruled to sustain the demurrer filed by Defendants EOS Fitness LLC, Apparcel, and Jones against Plaintiff Sanchez's first amended complaint. This means the court finds the complaint doesn't adequately state legal claims for discrimination under various California and federal laws, as well as intentional infliction of emotional distress.

The judge highlighted that Plaintiff failed to provide sufficient factual support for his claims of racial discrimination and assault by individuals not named as Defendants. 

The court granted Plaintiff 10 days to amend his complaint to address these deficiencies. The motion to strike filed by Defendants is deemed moot in light of the decision to grant leave to amend.

##  Tentative Ruling Summary: Sanchez v. EOS Fitness, LLC et al.

**Department:** C SANCHEZ

**Parties:**

* **Plaintiff:** Sanchez
* **Defendants:** EOS Fitness LLC, Apparcel, Jones 

**Facts:**

* Plaintiff alleges his gym membership was canceled on May 13, 2022, because team members felt harassed and uncomfortable by his patriotic attire (e.g., wearing a bandanna with a flag).
* Plaintiff claims he was physically assaulted by unknown individuals at the gym.
* Plaintiff alleges racial discrimination based on a painting of the Hollywood sign on the gym wall.

**Disputes:**

* Defendants demur to the complaint, arguing the 1st, 4th-7th causes of action fail to state a claim.
* Plaintiff's opposition to the demurrer was 33 pages long, exceeding the 15-page limit. 

**Legal Issues:**

* **Violation of California Civil Code Sections 51, 51.7, 52, and 52.1:** These sections prohibit discrimination and violence based on various protected characteristics.
* **Violation of 42 U.S. Code Section 1983:** This section addresses deprivations of federal civil rights.
* **Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED):** This tort requires outrageous conduct by the defendant causing severe emotional distress.

**Judge's Ruling:**

* **Demurrer SUSTAINED:** The court sustains the demurrer to the 1st, 4th-6th, and 8th causes of action with 10 days leave to amend.
* **Reasons:**
    * Plaintiff fails to provide factual support for racial discrimination claims.
    * Plaintiff's assault allegations are against unknown individuals not involved in the demurrer.
    * The conduct complained of (membership cancellation) does not rise to the level of outrageous conduct required for an IIED claim.
* **Motion to Strike MOOT:** The accompanying motion to strike is deemed moot due to the court's grant of leave to amend.

**Significance:**

* Plaintiff has an opportunity to amend the complaint to address the court's concerns and potentially reassert the dismissed causes of action.



## English Summary:

The judge has ruled that the defendants, EOS Fitness LLC, Apparcel, and Jones, can dismiss some of the claims made against them by the plaintiff, Sanchez.  

The judge found that Sanchez's claims of racial discrimination were not supported by factual evidence and that his allegations of assault were against people not involved in the case.

The judge also ruled that Sanchez's claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) was weak because the alleged actions of the defendants (cancelling his gym membership) did not rise to the level of "outrageous conduct."

The judge gave Sanchez 10 days to amend his complaint and fix these issues. If Sanchez does not amend his complaint, the defendants can proceed with dismissing the case against them.
