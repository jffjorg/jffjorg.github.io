Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Sanchez v. EOS Fitness, LLC, et al. The defendants have demurred to the plaintiff's first amended complaint, alleging that the causes of action fail to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and are uncertain. The Judge has sustained the demurrer with 10 days leave to amend.

The plaintiff alleges that his gym membership was cancelled due to racial discrimination and harassment. However, the Judge notes that the plaintiff provides no facts supporting any such "racial" discrimination. The Judge also finds that the conduct complained of (i.e. cancelling the plaintiff's gym membership) does not rise to the level of outrageous conduct.

The Judge also finds that the defendants' motion to strike is moot in light of the grant of leave to amend.

Overall, the Judge's tentative ruling suggests that the plaintiff will need to provide more specific and factual allegations in order to state a cause of action.

## English Summary:

The judge has tentatively ruled to sustain the demurrer filed by Defendants EOS Fitness LLC, Apparcel, and Jones against Plaintiff Sanchez's first amended complaint. This means the court finds the complaint doesn't adequately state legal claims for discrimination under various California and federal laws, as well as intentional infliction of emotional distress.

The judge highlighted that Plaintiff failed to provide sufficient factual support for his claims of racial discrimination and assault by individuals not named as Defendants. 

The court granted Plaintiff 10 days to amend his complaint to address these deficiencies. The motion to strike filed by Defendants is deemed moot in light of the decision to grant leave to amend.
