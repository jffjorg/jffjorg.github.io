The defendant, American Honda Motor Co., Inc., had moved to compel arbitration based on an arbitration agreement contained in the retail installment sale contract (RISC) signed by the plaintiff, Wynona Harris. The court found that the arbitration agreement is not enforceable because the claims alleged by the plaintiff arise from the defendant's statutory obligations under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act and not from the sales contract. The court also found that equitable estoppel does not apply because the claims do not arise directly from the contract. Furthermore, the court held that the manufacturer's warranties are not founded in the contract and that the third-party beneficiary doctrine does not apply because there is no motivating purpose between the contracting parties to provide a benefit to the manufacturer. As a result, the court has denied the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings.

## Tentative Ruling Summary: Harris v. American Honda Motor Co.

**Case Number:** 22NWCV01686
**Hearing Date:** September 26, 2023
**Department:** C

**Parties:**

* **Plaintiff:** Wynona Harris
* **Defendant:** American Honda Motor Co., Inc. ("Honda")

**Summary:**

The court denies Honda's motion to compel arbitration in this case.  

**Facts:**

* On February 29, 2020, Plaintiff Harris purchased a 2016 Honda Pilot from Norm Reeves Honda Superstore (not a party to this case).
* Plaintiff alleges the vehicle had brake, transmission, and engine defects.
* Plaintiff filed a lawsuit against Honda alleging violations of the Song-Beverly Act and fraudulent inducement.
* The purchase agreement Harris signed with Norm Reeves Honda Superstore contained an arbitration clause.

**Legal Issues:**

* **Enforceability of Arbitration Clause:**

    * Honda argued the arbitration clause in the purchase agreement compels arbitration because it covers disputes arising from the "purchase or condition of this vehicle."
    * The court disagreed, citing **Ford Motor Warranty Cases (Ford)**, which held that manufacturer warranties are not "intimately founded in and intertwined" with a sales contract. 
    * The court found that the arbitration clause doesn't specifically include manufacturer warranties and Plaintiff's claims are based on Honda's statutory obligations, not the contract.

* **Third-Party Beneficiary:**

    * Honda argued it can enforce the arbitration clause as a third-party beneficiary.
    * The court rejected this argument, finding that the contract lacked the necessary intent to benefit Honda as a third party.

**Significant Statements:**

* The court explicitly followed the reasoning in **Ford** over **Felisilda v. FCA US LLC**, which the court found to be distinguishable.
* The court emphasized that the arbitration clause doesn't encompass manufacturer warranties and that Plaintiff's claims are based on statutory obligations, not contractual obligations.

**Outcome:**

The court denied Honda's motion to compel arbitration.

**Tentative Ruling: American Honda Motor Co. v. Wynona Harris**

**Case Number:** 22NWCV01686
**Hearing Date:** September 26, 2023
**Department:** C

**Summary:**

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on American Honda Motor Co.'s ("Honda") motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings in the case against Wynona Harris ("Plaintiff"). The Court has denied Honda's motion, finding that the arbitration agreement is not enforceable.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Arbitration Agreement:** Honda has met its burden of proving the existence of a valid arbitration agreement between Plaintiff and nonparty Norm Reeves Honda Superstore. However, the Court finds that the arbitration agreement does not cover the controversy or controversies in the parties' dispute.
2. **Equitable Estoppel:** The Court disagrees with Honda's argument that equitable estoppel applies, as Plaintiff's claims arise from Honda's statutory obligation and not from the sales contract.
3. **Third-Party Beneficiary:** The Court finds that Honda is not a third-party beneficiary of the arbitration agreement, as there is no motivating purpose between Plaintiff and the Dealership to provide a benefit for Honda.

**Conclusion:**

Honda's motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings is DENIED. The Court need not address Plaintiff's alternative argument that the contract is unconscionable.

**Next Steps:**

The Court orders Plaintiff to give notice of this ruling. The case will proceed to a trial or further hearing as scheduled.
