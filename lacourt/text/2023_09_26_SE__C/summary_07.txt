And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings. The defendant, American Honda Motor Co., Inc., had moved to compel arbitration based on an arbitration agreement contained in the retail installment sale contract (RISC) signed by the plaintiff, Wynona Harris. The court found that the arbitration agreement is not enforceable because the claims alleged by the plaintiff arise from the defendant's statutory obligations under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act and not from the sales contract. The court also found that equitable estoppel does not apply because the claims do not arise directly from the contract. Furthermore, the court held that the manufacturer's warranties are not founded in the contract and that the third-party beneficiary doctrine does not apply because there is no motivating purpose between the contracting parties to provide a benefit to the manufacturer. As a result, the court has denied the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings.
