And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment in the case, Saadia Square v. All-Ways, case number 21NWCV00133. The defendants, Rialto Merrill Holdings, LLC, All-Ways Pacific LLC, All-Ways Far East, LLC, and All-Ways Forwarding International Inc., argued that they had met their burden of negating the necessary elements of Saadia Square's claims of tortious interference with its Right of First Offer (ROFO) and declaratory judgment.

The judge found that the defendants had proven that their Option Agreement was superior to Saadia Square's unrecorded ROFO and that they did not have knowledge of Saadia Square's ROFO on March 11, 2020, when the Option was created. Therefore, the judge determined that Saadia Square did not have a valid claim of tortious interference.

Additionally, the judge found that Saadia Square's declaratory claim failed as it was derivative of its interference claim. Saadia Square argued that the sale was a sham and that the defendants had waived any defects in exercising the option, but the judge found that Saadia Square had failed to sustain its burden of proving these claims.

As a result, the judge granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment and dismissed Saadia Square's claims of tortious interference with its ROFO and declaratory judgment.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment, meaning that Saadia Square's remaining causes of action for tortious interference with its Right of First Offer (ROFO) and declaratory judgment are dismissed. The defendants, Rialto Merrill Holdings, LLC, All-Ways Pacific LLC, All-Ways Far East, LLC, and All-Ways Forwarding International Inc., have met their burden of proving that their Option Agreement is superior to Saadia's unrecorded ROFO. The judge has found that the Option relates back to March 11, 2020, when the Option was created, and that All-Ways did not have knowledge of Saadia's ROFO at that time. Therefore, Saadia's interference claim fails because it requires proof that All-Ways had knowledge of the contract. The judge has also found that Saadia's declaratory claim fails because it is derivative of the interference claim.

## English Summary

The Judge has ruled in favor of All-Ways and against Saadia Square. 

The Judge found that All-Ways is legally entitled to enforce an Option Agreement they made with SM (Saadia Square's company) in 2020 to buy a property.  

Saadia Square argued that All-Ways violated her Right of First Offer (ROFO) on the property. However, the Judge determined that the Option Agreement predates Saadia Square's knowledge of it and therefore All-Ways was not obligated to consider her ROFO.

The Judge also rejected Saadia Square's claims that the transaction was a sham and that All-Ways' exercise of the Option was invalid.

As a result, the Judge granted All-Ways' motion for summary judgment, effectively ending Saadia Square's case.

* "Saadia waived these arguments. Therefore, they are precluded as a matter of law."
* "Saadia has failed to sustain its burden of proving that the Option is void under ultra vires."
