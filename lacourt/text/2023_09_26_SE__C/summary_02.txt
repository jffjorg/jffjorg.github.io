And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment in the case, Saadia Square v. All-Ways, case number 21NWCV00133. The defendants, Rialto Merrill Holdings, LLC, All-Ways Pacific LLC, All-Ways Far East, LLC, and All-Ways Forwarding International Inc., argued that they had met their burden of negating the necessary elements of Saadia Square's claims of tortious interference with its Right of First Offer (ROFO) and declaratory judgment.

The judge found that the defendants had proven that their Option Agreement was superior to Saadia Square's unrecorded ROFO and that they did not have knowledge of Saadia Square's ROFO on March 11, 2020, when the Option was created. Therefore, the judge determined that Saadia Square did not have a valid claim of tortious interference.

Additionally, the judge found that Saadia Square's declaratory claim failed as it was derivative of its interference claim. Saadia Square argued that the sale was a sham and that the defendants had waived any defects in exercising the option, but the judge found that Saadia Square had failed to sustain its burden of proving these claims.

As a result, the judge granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment and dismissed Saadia Square's claims of tortious interference with its ROFO and declaratory judgment.
