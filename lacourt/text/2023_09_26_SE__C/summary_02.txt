And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment in the case, Saadia Square v. All-Ways, case number 21NWCV00133. The defendants, Rialto Merrill Holdings, LLC, All-Ways Pacific LLC, All-Ways Far East, LLC, and All-Ways Forwarding International Inc., argued that they had met their burden of negating the necessary elements of Saadia Square's claims of tortious interference with its Right of First Offer (ROFO) and declaratory judgment.

The judge found that the defendants had proven that their Option Agreement was superior to Saadia Square's unrecorded ROFO and that they did not have knowledge of Saadia Square's ROFO on March 11, 2020, when the Option was created. Therefore, the judge determined that Saadia Square did not have a valid claim of tortious interference.

Additionally, the judge found that Saadia Square's declaratory claim failed as it was derivative of its interference claim. Saadia Square argued that the sale was a sham and that the defendants had waived any defects in exercising the option, but the judge found that Saadia Square had failed to sustain its burden of proving these claims.

As a result, the judge granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment and dismissed Saadia Square's claims of tortious interference with its ROFO and declaratory judgment.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment, meaning that Saadia Square's remaining causes of action for tortious interference with its Right of First Offer (ROFO) and declaratory judgment are dismissed. The defendants, Rialto Merrill Holdings, LLC, All-Ways Pacific LLC, All-Ways Far East, LLC, and All-Ways Forwarding International Inc., have met their burden of proving that their Option Agreement is superior to Saadia's unrecorded ROFO. The judge has found that the Option relates back to March 11, 2020, when the Option was created, and that All-Ways did not have knowledge of Saadia's ROFO at that time. Therefore, Saadia's interference claim fails because it requires proof that All-Ways had knowledge of the contract. The judge has also found that Saadia's declaratory claim fails because it is derivative of the interference claim.

significant\_statements:
  - "Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED."
  - "All-Ways has met its burden of negating a necessary element of its claim because it has proven that its Option is superior to Saadia’s unrecorded ROFO."
  - "Saadia argues that the sale was a sham... However, Saadia offers no authority which states that the parties were not entitled to conduct the transaction in such a manner."
  - "Saadia waived any purported defects in (All-Ways)’s exercise of the Option by accepting the exercise of the option without objection... and Saadia cannot challenge that waiver."
  - "Saadia has failed to sustain its burden of proving that the transaction ‘never occurred’ or was a sham."
  - "Saadia argues that the financing had to be delivered on March 11, 2021... However, ‘[t]he acceptance of the exercise of the option without objection to the form of the exercise waives any objection to the form of the exercise.’"
  - "Saadia argues that SM’s acceptance of the Option and waiver of the conditions were ultra vires actions... However, Saadia has failed to sustain its burden of providing evidence to support its defense that the modification of the Option was an ultra vires act."
  - "Saadia argues that the relation-back doctrine does not apply because All-Ways and SM modified the contract... However, Wachovia clarified that the relation-back doctrine would not apply when the optionee ‘cannot enforce the option, but the optionee nevertheless purchases title to the subject property in a new transaction wholly unconnected with the option.’"
  - "Saadia’s defense that the relation-back doctrine does not apply fails as a matter of law."

In this tentative ruling, the Judge grants the Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment against the Plaintiff Saadia Square’s remaining causes of action for tortious interference with its ROFO and declaratory judgment in its Second Amended Complaint. The Judge finds that the Defendants have proven that their Option is superior to Saadia’s unrecorded ROFO, and the Option relates back to March 11, 2020, when it was created. Therefore, Saadia cannot prove a necessary element of its interference claim, and its declaratory claim fails as it is derivative of the interference claim.
