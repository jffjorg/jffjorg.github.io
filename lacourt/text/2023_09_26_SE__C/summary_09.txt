As a result, the court finds that the Defendant has made a general appearance and waived the issue of personal jurisdiction. The Judge orders the Defendant to file and serve its Answer within 10 days.

## English Text Summary

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Bryan v. Scotty and Son Towing, Collision, and Automotive Repair. In this ruling, the judge overrules the defendant's demurrer, which argued the court lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant. 

The defendant, Scotty and Son Towing, claimed the court didn't have the authority to hear the case because they primarily do business in Arizona.

As a result, the defendant is ordered to file an answer to the plaintiff's complaint within 10 days.

**English Summary:**

The judge has ruled that the Defendant's demurrer (a legal objection challenging the court's jurisdiction) is "overruled." This means the Defendant's challenge to the court's authority to hear the case is rejected.  

The judge's ruling states that the Defendant waived its right to challenge personal jurisdiction by filing a demurrer without simultaneously filing a motion to quash. A motion to quash is a separate legal filing specifically designed to challenge personal jurisdiction. 

The Defendant is now ordered to file an "Answer" to the Plaintiff's complaint within 10 days. An Answer is a formal response to the allegations made in the complaint, outlining the Defendant's position.

### English Text Summary
The judge's tentative ruling in the case of BRYAN v. SCOTTY AND SON TOWING, COLLISION, AND AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR (Case No. 23NWCV01003) is as follows: 

The defendant, SCOTTY AND SON TOWING, COLLISION, AND AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR, has demurred to the plaintiff's complaint, arguing that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over the defendant. However, the defendant failed to concurrently file a motion to quash, which is required to challenge personal jurisdiction. 

According to California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) § 418.10, a defendant who demurs or moves to strike must also move to quash or dismiss, or the jurisdictional defect is waived. The defendant's failure to do so means that they have waived the issue of personal jurisdiction. 

The court finds that the defendant has made a general appearance and has waived the issue of the court's lack of personal jurisdiction. Therefore, the demurrer is overruled, and the defendant is ordered to file and serve its answer within 10 days. 

The plaintiff alleges that the defendant entered into a repair contract and performed defective work, resulting in the vehicle being in worse condition than when it was towed to the defendant's repair shop. The plaintiff asserts causes of action for breach of contract, promissory estoppel, fraudulent misrepresentation, and negligence. 

The case will proceed with the defendant required to respond to the complaint, and the court will consider the plaintiff's allegations and the defendant's response in determining the outcome of the case.
