However, the Defendant did not simultaneously file a motion to quash, which would have challenged the court's jurisdiction. As a result, the court finds that the Defendant has made a general appearance and waived the issue of personal jurisdiction. The Judge orders the Defendant to file and serve its Answer within 10 days.

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Bryan v. Scotty and Son Towing, Collision, and Automotive Repair. In this ruling, the judge overrules the defendant's demurrer, which argued the court lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant.

As a result, the defendant is ordered to file an answer to the plaintiff's complaint within 10 days.

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint is overruled. The defendant, Scotty and Son Towing, Collision, and Automotive Repair, had argued that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over it because the plaintiff resides in Arizona and the defendant is not doing business in California. However, the defendant failed to file a motion to quash, which is required when challenging personal jurisdiction. As a result, the court finds that the defendant has waived its right to challenge personal jurisdiction and has made a general appearance in the court. The defendant is ordered to file and serve its answer within 10 days.
