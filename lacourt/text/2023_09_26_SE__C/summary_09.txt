```

And here is the English-text summary:

The tentatively ruling Judge has overruled Defendant Scotty and Son Towing, Collision, and Auto Repair's demurrer to the Plaintiff's complaint. The Defendant demurred, arguing that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over it because the complaint alleges that the Defendant is doing business in Arizona. However, the Defendant did not simultaneously file a motion to quash, which would have challenged the court's jurisdiction. As a result, the court finds that the Defendant has made a general appearance and waived the issue of personal jurisdiction. The Judge orders the Defendant to file and serve its Answer within 10 days.
