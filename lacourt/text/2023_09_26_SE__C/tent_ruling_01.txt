TENTATIVE
ORDER
 
Defendants
Nunley and Bashmen’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s third amended complaint is
SUSTAINED with 10 days leave to amend.
 
Moving Parties to give
NOTICE.
 
 
Defendant
Downey Unified School District (“District”) demurs to all causes of action on
the grounds that they fail to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action.
 
This
action was filed by Plaintiff Skinner by and through his guardian ad litem,
Brenda Nonette on 6/9/20, and was amended twice.  The operative Third Amended Complaint (“TAC”)
alleges that Skinner was an invitee of Defendant Downey High School on 1/14/20,
when he was summoned to the boys gymnasium by another student where 20 or more
students from the Varsity football team attacked and beat him.  (TAC, GN-1.) 
Plaintiff was able to run out of the gym to the supervising
Coaches.  (Id.)  Defendants failed to supervise the football
team despite being on notice of the hazing by the Varsity football team against
lower classmen such as Plaintiff.  (Id.)  Based on these facts, the TAC asserts a single cause of
action for General Negligence.
 
1st
CAUSE OF ACTION
 
GENERAL NEGLIGENCE:
 
Government
entities can only be liable where plaintiff pleads: (i) an authorizing statute
for the government tort liability, and (ii) detailed as well as particularized
facts concerning how the governmental defendant supposedly erred.  (Gov. Code § 815(a); Searcy v. Hemet
Unified Sch. Dist. (1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 792, 802; Susman v. City of Los
Angeles (1969) 269 Cal.App.2d 803, 809; Eastburn v. Regional Fire
Protection Authority (2003) 31 Cal.4th 1175, 1183.)


¶¶
GN-1 and IT-1 allege the following statutes:  Penal Code §§ 11165.7 and 11166.5, Educ. Code §§
44807 and 44808, and Gov. Code § 815.2.
 
Gov. Code § 815.2 provides, “(a) A public entity is liable for
injury proximately caused by an act or omission of an employee of the public
entity within the scope of his employment if the act or omission would, apart
from this section, have given rise to a cause of action against that employee
or his personal representative.  (b) Except as otherwise provided by
statute, a public entity is not liable for an injury resulting from an act or
omission of an employee of the public entity where the employee is immune from
liability.”  
 
“A public entity may be
vicariously liable for the act or omission of its employee acting in the scope
of employment… However, the public entity is not vicariously liable if the
employee is immune from liability... 
 
Gov.
Code, § 815.6, provides a statutory basis for direct liability of a public
entity. There are three elements necessary to establish the liability of a
public entity under § 815.6: (1) A mandatory duty
imposed on the public entity by an enactment; (2) the enactment was designed to
protect against the particular kind of injury that the plaintiff suffered; and
(3) the plaintiff's injury was proximately caused by the public entity's
failure to discharge its mandatory duty.” 
(All Angels 
Preschool/Daycare v. County of Merced
(2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 394, 400.) 
 
Penal
Code §§ 11165.7 and 11165.5 are mandatory reporting statutes.  ¶ GN-1 alleges that Defendants are mandated
reporters and failed to summon the police or DHS after learning of the assault
and battery.
 
Educ.
Code § 44807 provides, “Every teacher in the
public schools shall hold pupils to a strict account for their conduct on the
way to and from school, on the playgrounds, or during recess.”
 
¶ GN-1 alleges that Defendant’s “employees” failed to supervise the
football team despite being on notice of the hazing by the Varsity football
team against lower classmen such as Plaintiff. 
The TAC does not identify who these employees are.
 
While
the court finds that the TAC properly alleges a statutory basis against the individual
employees, the 1st cause of action is only directed against the
District, and not against any specific individuals.  (See TAC, GN-1.)  
 
Accordingly,
the demurrer to the 1st cause of action is SUSTAINED with 10 days
leave to amend to allege that the claim is made against the individual
Defendants.
