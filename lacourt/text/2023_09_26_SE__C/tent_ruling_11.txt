 Case Number:  BC710923    Hearing Date:   September 26, 2023    Dept:  C Plaintiff's ex parte application for terminating and monetary
sanctions for discovery abuse is GRANTED in the alternative.  The court
will shorten time on Plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions.
 
In initial discovery, Defendants affirmed that "Cole had
never attacked any person, bitten any person, or exhibited any aggressive
or protective behavior. Defendants further affirmed that Cole had never
been muzzled, that Defendants had never been contacted by any law enforcement
agency regarding Cole, and that Cole had never been picked up by any
animal control agency."  Plaintiff discovered that in reality,
"Cole had attacked and/or bitten at least three people, including two
children ages three and eight. All three attacks (including the subject
attack) caused significant, permanent injuries to the respective victim’s
face. Cole had been muzzled prior to the subject incident; Cole had been
quarantined multiple times by governmental agencies; and, ultimately, Cole
was euthanized in 2018 after he attacked and bit the face of an eight-year
old child."  (Ex Parte 3:17-4:1.)  
 
The five year statute is approaching in December 2023, and
plaintiff will be irreparably harmed if forced to proceed to trial without
having this motion heard.
 
The motion for terminating sanctions set for February 8, 2024, is
advanced to this date and continued to November 7, 2023 at 10:30 am in Dept.
C.  Moving Party to give notice.
