## English Summary

The Judge is considering a demurrer filed by the Defendants, Nunley and Bashmen, and the Downey Unified School District (District) to the Plaintiff's (Skinner) complaint. 

A demurrer is a legal argument that the Plaintiff's complaint does not state a valid legal claim. The Judge found that the Plaintiff's complaint sufficiently alleges a legal basis for holding the individual employees liable but doesn't clearly state a claim against the District itself.

Therefore, the Judge is sustaining the demurrer with 10 days for the Plaintiff to amend the complaint to clarify the claims against the District and individual Defendants.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the demurrer to the plaintiff's third amended complaint is sustained, with 10 days leave to amend. The plaintiff, Skinner, alleges that the defendant Downey Unified School District is liable for the actions of its employees for failure to supervise the Varsity football team, which resulted in Skinner being attacked and beaten. The defendant demurred to all causes of action, arguing that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The judge found that the complaint does not identify the individual employees who failed to supervise the team and therefore sustained the demurrer. The plaintiff has 10 days to amend the complaint to include the specific individual defendants.
