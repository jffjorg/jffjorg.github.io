## English Summary

The Judge is considering a demurrer filed by the Defendants, Nunley and Bashmen, and the Downey Unified School District (District) to the Plaintiff's (Skinner) complaint. 

A demurrer is a legal argument that the Plaintiff's complaint does not state a valid legal claim. The Judge found that the Plaintiff's complaint sufficiently alleges a legal basis for holding the individual employees liable but doesn't clearly state a claim against the District itself.

Therefore, the Judge is sustaining the demurrer with 10 days for the Plaintiff to amend the complaint to clarify the claims against the District and individual Defendants.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the demurrer to the plaintiff's third amended complaint is sustained, with 10 days leave to amend. The plaintiff, Skinner, alleges that the defendant Downey Unified School District is liable for the actions of its employees for failure to supervise the Varsity football team, which resulted in Skinner being attacked and beaten. The defendant demurred to all causes of action, arguing that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The judge found that the complaint does not identify the individual employees who failed to supervise the team and therefore sustained the demurrer. The plaintiff has 10 days to amend the complaint to include the specific individual defendants.

## Tentative Ruling Summary: Skinner v. Downey Unified School District

**Case Number:** 20STCV21816

**Plaintiff:**  Skinner (by and through guardian ad litem Brenda Nonette)

**Defendant:** Downey Unified School District, Nunley, Bashmen

**Hearing Date:** September 26, 2023

**Dept:** C 

**Significant Statements:**

* **Judge's Decision:**  The court sustains the demurrer (a legal challenge to the complaint) filed by defendants Nunley and Bashmen to the plaintiff's third amended complaint, giving plaintiff 10 days to amend the complaint. 
* **Reasoning:** The court finds that the plaintiff's first cause of action (General Negligence) is only directed against the Downey Unified School District, not against the individual defendants Nunley and Bashmen.

**Facts:**

*  Plaintiff Skinner was allegedly attacked and beaten by 20+ students from the Varsity football team at Downey High School on January 14, 2020. 
* Plaintiff claims the school district failed to supervise the football team despite being aware of hazing incidents.

**Legal Issues:**

* **Government Tort Liability:** California law imposes specific requirements for holding government entities (like school districts) liable for injuries.  Plaintiff must allege:
    * An authorizing statute for the government tort liability.
    * Specific facts detailing how the school district allegedly erred.
* **Statutory Basis:** The plaintiff cites several statutes, including Penal Code §§ 11165.7 and 11166.5, Educ. Code §§ 44807 and 44808, and Gov. Code § 815.2.
* **Vicarious Liability:** A public entity can be held liable for its employees' actions if those actions fall within the scope of their employment. However, this vicarious liability is limited by the employee's own potential immunity from liability.

**Disputes:**

* The central dispute is whether the school district's alleged failure to supervise the football team constitutes negligence that warrants liability.
* The plaintiff needs to clearly identify the specific employees who allegedly failed to supervise and how their actions directly caused the plaintiff's injuries.

**Agreements:**

*  None mentioned in the provided text.

**Intentions:**

* The plaintiff intends to hold the Downey Unified School District liable for the injuries sustained during the alleged attack.
* The defendants, Nunley and Bashmen, intend to challenge the plaintiff's complaint.



**Notes:**

This summary is based solely on the provided tentative ruling. A full understanding of the case requires reviewing the entire complaint, demurrer, and any supporting legal arguments.
