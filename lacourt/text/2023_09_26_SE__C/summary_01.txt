And here is the English summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the case 20STCV21816, which involves a lawsuit filed by Skinner against the Downey Unified School District, et al. The lawsuit alleges that the defendants were negligent in failing to supervise the Varsity football team, which attacked and beat Skinner on January 14, 2020. The defendants demurred to the first cause of action, arguing that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The court has sustained the demurrer, but granted the plaintiff 10 days to amend the complaint to specifically identify the individual employees who are alleged to have been negligent. The court has also noted that the complaint properly alleges a statutory basis against the individual employees under various statutes, including Government Code § 815(a) and Penal Code §§ 11165.7 and 11166.5.
