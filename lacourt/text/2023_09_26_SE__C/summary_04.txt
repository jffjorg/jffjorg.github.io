## English Summary

The Judge has denied the Defendants' (Nissan North America, Inc. and Corona Nissan) motion to compel arbitration in this case.  

The Plaintiff (Carlos Rodriguez) alleges that his used Nissan Sentra has an Emergency Braking Defect and is suing for breach of warranty, fraudulent inducement, and negligent repair. The Defendants argued that the Plaintiff should be compelled to arbitrate his claims based on an arbitration clause in the Retail Installment Sale Contract (RISC) he signed with the dealership. 

However, the Judge found that the arbitration clause in the RISC does not apply to claims against Nissan North America, Inc. as they are not a third-party beneficiary to the contract. The Court looked at precedent cases like *Ford Motor Warranty Cases* and found that the language of the arbitration clause did not intend to include manufacturers like Nissan.
