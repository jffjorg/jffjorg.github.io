English-text summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Carlos Rodriguez v. Nissan North America, Inc. and Corona Nissan. The defendants have moved to compel arbitration and stay proceedings, but the court has denied their motion. The court finds that the arbitration agreement is not enforceable because it does not cover the statutory manufacturer warranties claims, which are the basis of the plaintiff's claims. The court also finds that the defendants are not third-party beneficiaries who can enforce the arbitration agreement. Therefore, the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings is denied.
