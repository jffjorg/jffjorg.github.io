## English Summary

The Judge has denied the Defendants' (Nissan North America, Inc. and Corona Nissan) motion to compel arbitration in this case.  

The Plaintiff (Carlos Rodriguez) alleges that his used Nissan Sentra has an Emergency Braking Defect and is suing for breach of warranty, fraudulent inducement, and negligent repair. The Defendants argued that the Plaintiff should be compelled to arbitrate his claims based on an arbitration clause in the Retail Installment Sale Contract (RISC) he signed with the dealership. 

However, the Judge found that the arbitration clause in the RISC does not apply to claims against Nissan North America, Inc. as they are not a third-party beneficiary to the contract. The Court looked at precedent cases like *Ford Motor Warranty Cases* and found that the language of the arbitration clause did not intend to include manufacturers like Nissan.

## Case Summary: Rodriguez v. Nissan North America

**Case Number:** 22NWCV00671
**Hearing Date:** September 26, 2023
**Department:** C

**Parties:**

* **Plaintiff:** Carlos Rodriguez
* **Defendants:** Nissan North America, Inc. and Corona Nissan

**Facts:**

* On November 15, 2021, Plaintiff Carlos Rodriguez purchased a used 2021 Nissan Sentra.
* Plaintiff alleges the vehicle has an Emergency Braking Defect.
* Plaintiff filed suit against Defendants alleging violations of the Song-Beverly Act, fraudulent inducement, and negligent repair.

**Legal Issues:**

* **Enforceability of Arbitration Agreement:** Defendants moved to compel arbitration based on an arbitration clause in the Retail Installment Sale Contract (RISC) signed by Plaintiff.

**Judge's Reasoning:**

* **Equitable Estoppel:** The court considered whether equitable estoppel applied to compel arbitration since Plaintiff did not sign the RISC with Defendant, but with a third party (Corona Nissan).
* The court found that Plaintiff's claims are based on statutory obligations of Defendant Nissan, not on any contractual language in the RISC.
* The court relied on the California Court of Appeal case *Ford Motor Warranty Cases* (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324, which held that equitable estoppel does not apply when a plaintiff's claims arise from statutory obligations and not contractual terms.
* **Third-Party Beneficiary:** The court also rejected Defendant's argument that they are third-party beneficiaries of the RISC.

**Ruling:**

* The court denied Defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings.

**Key Points:**

* The court emphasized that equitable estoppel applies only when a plaintiff relies on a contract in asserting claims against a third party while attempting to avoid the contract's arbitration provision.
*  The court found no evidence that the RISC intended to benefit Defendant Nissan as a third-party beneficiary.
*  The court concluded that Plaintiff's claims are based on statutory obligations and not contractual terms, making equitable estoppel inapplicable.

**Case Information**

* Case Number: 22NWCV00671
* Plaintiff: Carlos Rodriguez
* Defendant: Nissan North America, Inc. and Corona Nissan

**Summary**

The court has denied the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings. The defendants had argued that the plaintiff's claims were subject to arbitration under a valid arbitration agreement and that the court should stay proceedings pending arbitration.

**Facts**

* The plaintiff purchased a used 2021 Nissan Sentra from Corona Nissan on November 15, 2021.
* The vehicle allegedly suffers from an Emergency Braking Defect.
* The plaintiff has asserted causes of action for violation of the Song-Beverly Act, fraudulent inducement, and negligent repair.

**Disputes**

* The defendants argue that the arbitration agreement is valid and should be enforced.
* The plaintiff argues that the arbitration agreement is not enforceable because it does not cover the manufacturer's warranties and because the claims arise from statutory obligations rather than contractual language.

**Arbitration Agreement**

* The contract contains an arbitration clause that requires arbitration of any claim or dispute arising out of or related to the purchase or condition of the vehicle.
* The defendants argue that the arbitration agreement is valid and should be enforced.
* The plaintiff argues that the arbitration agreement is not enforceable because it does not cover the manufacturer's warranties and because the claims arise from statutory obligations rather than contractual language.

**Equitable Estoppel**

* The defendants argue that the plaintiff should be estopped from denying the enforceability of the arbitration agreement because the plaintiff has agreed to arbitrate claims against a non-party dealership.
* The court finds that equitable estoppel does not apply because the plaintiff's claims arise from statutory obligations rather than contractual language.

**Third-Party Beneficiary**

* The defendants argue that they are third-party beneficiaries of the arbitration agreement.
* The court finds that the defendants are not third-party beneficiaries because there is no evidence that the contracting parties intended to benefit the defendants.

**Ruling**

* The court has denied the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings.

**Intentions**

* The court's intention is to deny the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings.
