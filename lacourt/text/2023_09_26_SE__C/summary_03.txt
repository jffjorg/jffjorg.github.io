And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving John Manuel Hernandez, Jr. (Plaintiff) and the Whittier Girls Softball League, Tony Avila, and Moses Galicia (Defendants). The Plaintiff alleges negligence and assault/battery by the Defendants, specifically that Galicia, the League President, failed to de-escalate a situation and instead joined the fray and assisted in beating up the Plaintiff. The Defendants demurred to the complaint, which the judge has overruled, allowing the case to proceed.

The judge notes that the Plaintiff's allegations are sufficient to survive demurrer, and the parties may conduct discovery to determine the factual basis supporting whether the incident occurred at a Whittier Girls Softball League event. The judge also notes that the court must consider whether Galicia's actions were within the scope of his employment, as respondeat superior, the doctrine of vicarious liability, is not applied to acts outside the scope of employment.

In essence, the judge is allowing the case to proceed, allowing the parties to gather evidence and present their cases, and will ultimately make a determination on the merits of the case after considering the evidence presented.

significant\_statements:
  - "The liability of the League is therefore based upon its Respondent’s Superior liability for the conduct of its League President Galicia for his wrongful conduct in intervening in an argument over League activity between League members at a League event, but also upon its own negligence in its wrongful interference with the participation of the Hernandez family in public events of attending and participating at League events."
  - "The failure to discharge an employee who has committed misconduct may be evidence of ratification."

The Judge's tentative ruling overrules the demurrer to Plaintiffs' second amended complaint and orders Defendant Whittier Girls Softball League to file and serve its Answer within 10 days. The dispute revolves around an incident at a Whittier Girls Softball League event where Plaintiff Hernandez was approached by Defendant Avila in a belligerent manner. League President Galicia intervened but did not take any action to mitigate or resolve the fight, and later joined in and assisted defendants in beating up Hernandez. Plaintiffs assert causes of action for negligence and assault and battery, and allege that Galicia's actions were within the scope of his employment and that the League is responsible for his actions. The court will allow the SAC to survive demurrer and the parties may conduct discovery to determine the factual basis supporting whether the incident occurred at a Whittier Girls Softball League event and whether Galicia's actions were in the scope of his employment.
