The demurrer has been OVERRULED, and the defendant is ordered to file and serve its answer within 10 days. The judge has also allowed the plaintiffs' allegations of negligence and assault and battery to survive the demurrer. The parties are permitted to conduct discovery to determine the factual basis supporting whether the incident occurred at a Whittier Girls Softball League event. The judge notes that the doctrine of respondeat superior may apply, but the defendant's liability may also be based on its own negligence or intentional torts.
