And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving John Manuel Hernandez, Jr. (Plaintiff) and the Whittier Girls Softball League, Tony Avila, and Moses Galicia (Defendants). The Plaintiff alleges negligence and assault/battery by the Defendants, specifically that Galicia, the League President, failed to de-escalate a situation and instead joined the fray and assisted in beating up the Plaintiff. The Defendants demurred to the complaint, which the judge has overruled, allowing the case to proceed.

The judge notes that the Plaintiff's allegations are sufficient to survive demurrer, and the parties may conduct discovery to determine the factual basis supporting whether the incident occurred at a Whittier Girls Softball League event. The judge also notes that the court must consider whether Galicia's actions were within the scope of his employment, as respondeat superior, the doctrine of vicarious liability, is not applied to acts outside the scope of employment.

In essence, the judge is allowing the case to proceed, allowing the parties to gather evidence and present their cases, and will ultimately make a determination on the merits of the case after considering the evidence presented.
