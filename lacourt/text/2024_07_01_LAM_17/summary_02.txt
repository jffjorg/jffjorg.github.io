And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to deem his Requests for Admission (RFAs) admitted as to defendant Filip Jan Rymsza. The plaintiff served the RFAs on March 11, 2024, but the defendant did not respond. Since the defendant did not oppose the motion, the judge has granted the motion. The defendant is also sanctioned $700, payable within 30 days, jointly and severally with their counsel. The judge's ruling is based on the facts that the plaintiff served the RFAs and the defendant did not respond, and the lack of justification from the defendant for their failure to respond.
