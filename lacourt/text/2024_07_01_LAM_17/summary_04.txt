And here is the English text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the Govind Parties' motion for a stay of proceedings, as they have not posted sufficient bonds to trigger the stay of orders. The Judge also denies Govind's claim of exemption, as the $1,191.29 in his savings account is not necessary to support his family, given that his children are all mature adults and he has vast hotel and real estate holdings. The Judge notes that the bonds posted by the Govind Parties are insufficient to trigger the stay of orders, and that the Court has repeatedly denied their request for a discretionary stay. The Judge also finds that Govind's claim of exemption is not supported by the facts, as he has not demonstrated a hardship or need to retain the funds.
