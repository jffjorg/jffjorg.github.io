PRASHANT VAGHASHIA, et al. 
 
 


 Case No.: 
  BC696133
Related Case Nos.: BC696798 and
  BS172969
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  July 2, 2024



 
 
            The
Govind Parties’ motion for a stay of proceedings is DENIED. Govind’s Claim of
Exemption is DENIED. 
 
On 7/3/2018,
Plaintiffs Govind Vaghashia (Govind) as an individual and on behalf of Graphic
Research, Inc. dba Gtek/Bycan Systems filed a second amended complaint (SAC)
against Prashant Vaghashia (Prashant), Graphic Research, Inc. dba Gtek/Bycan
Systems (GRI), alleging: (1) involuntary dissolution; (2) breach of fiduciary
duty; (3) accounting; and (4) violation of Corporations Code sections 1601 and
1602. 
 
            Now,
the Govind Parties seek a stay of proceedings. Prashant and Mita seek a
determination of Govind’s claim of exemption. For ease, the Court has
consolidated its analysis into a single ruling. 

 
Discussion 
 
I.                  
Stay of Proceedings
 
The Govind
Parties seek a stay of proceedings based on their posting of over $19.82
million in bonds on May 21, 2024. The Govind Parties further argue that the Court
should exercise its discretion to stay the litigation. 
 
After review,
the Court denies the requested relief. 
 
In order to
trigger the stay of orders for the payment of money, the Govind Parties are
required to post 150% of the amount of the order. Cal. Civ. Proc. § 917.1. As
set forth in Prashant’s and Mita’s opposition, the bonds for the orders dated
December 1, 2023, and February 22, 2024, are insufficient. (Opp., 7:1-7:16.) 
 
The Court has
repeatedly denied the Govind Parties request for a discretionary stay, and the
Court denies this request here. 
 
            Based
on the foregoing, the Govind Parties’ request for a stay is denied. 
 
II.              
Claim of Exemption 
 
Govind
Vaghashia submitted a Claim of Exemption over $1,191.29 in his savings account
at Wells Fargo. Accordingly, Prashant and Mita seek a determination on the
claim. 
 
After review,
the Court denies Govind’s claim of exemption. 
 
In his claim,
Govind claims that the property consists of life insurance policies, yet also
declares that he is claiming only $1,191.29 from a Wells Fargo savings account.
He also admits that the savings account is “property and money belonging to the
account name, Govind Vaghashia.” Then, he claims that the $1,129.29 is “for the
purpose of his three children.” None of Govind Vaghashia’s children are minors.
Kavita Vaghashia is a licensed real estate broker, and is 30 years old. Sundeep
Vaghashia is a real estate investor and manager of his father’s business,
testified at trial in this case, and is 40 years old. Ronak Vaghashia is 37
years old.
 
Section
704.225 provides that money in a judgment debtor’s deposit account that is not
otherwise exempt under this chapter is exempt “to the extent necessary for the
support of the judgment debtor and the spouse and dependents of the judgment
debtor.” (CCP. § 704.225.) Section 704.225 is a hardship exemption, permitting
a judgment debtor to retain funds to the extent they are “needed to support a
family.” Where Govind’s children are all mature adults and Govind has vast
hotel and real estate holdings, the Court is not persuaded by his claim of
hardship, or that $1,191.29 is “necessary to support a family.” 
 
Based on the
foregoing, Govind’s claim of exemption is denied. 
 
It is so ordered.
