And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendant, City of Los Angeles, granting their motion to compel the plaintiff, Timothy Colomey, to undergo a psychological evaluation by Dr. David K. Wellisch. The defendant seeks this evaluation because the plaintiff has put his mental condition in controversy, and the judge finds that the plaintiff has not identified any meaningful prejudice that would result from the evaluation. The judge also disagrees with the plaintiff's contention that the motion is an improper motion for reconsideration, finding that the court has wide discretion to control the proceedings before it. The judge notes that the plaintiff underwent a mental health examination in January 2024, but did not provide notice of this examination until April 2024, and that the defendant's need to examine the plaintiff became concrete in April 2024.
