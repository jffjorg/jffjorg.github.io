RELIEF
REQUESTED 
 
            Demurring Parties object
to Plaintiff’s complaint.      
 
BACKGROUND
 
             This case arises out of Plaintiff Venken LLC’s
(“Plaintiff”) claim that Defendants MJ4 Capital, LLC, Jason Arrow, and Jaye E.
Davenport (“Defendants”) failed to pay rent for property located at 7772 Garvey
Avenue, Rosemead, California 91770. Plaintiff filed this complaint on August 4,
2023, alleging two causes of action for (1) breach of lease and (2) breach of
guaranty. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Demurring Parties’ demurrer is
OVERRULED.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
            Demurrer 
 
A general
demurrer may be taken to a complaint where “[t]he pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action.” (Code of Civ. Proc. § 430.10(e).) A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the
complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn
v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal. App. 4th 740, 747.) In a demurrer proceeding, the
defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or by proper judicial
notice.  (Code Civ. Proc. section
430.30(a).)  A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or
other extrinsic matters.  (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153
Cal. App. 3d 902, 905.)  The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is
whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action.  (Hahn v.
Mirda, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Demurring
Parties object to Plaintiff’s complaint on the sole grounds that Plaintiff
fails to allege that it obtained a certificate of occupancy. 
 
The essential elements of a breach
of contract are: (1) the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for
nonperformance, (3) the defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damages to
the plaintiff. (Green Valley Landowners Assn. v. City of Vallejo (2015)
241 Cal.App.4th. 425, 433.) Plaintiff alleges a contract in the form of a lease
(Complaint ¶ 14), its performance (Id. ¶
22), Defendants’ breach (Id. ¶ 23), and damages (Id. ¶ 27.) Plaintiff has alleged a claim for breach of contract.
 
Demurring Parties cite no authority for the heightened pleading
requirements they assert is applicable here. Demurring Parties’ arguments are
more akin to a fact-based argument seeking to demonstrate that Plaintiff cannot
establish its claims based on factual circumstances. The court does not weigh
in on the merits of Demurring Parties’ argument, because such an argument is
not applicable at the pleading stage. “The hearing on demurrer may not be
turned into a contested evidentiary hearing through the guise of having the
court take judicial notice of documents whose truthfulness or proper
interpretation are disputable.” (Fremont Indemnity Co. v. Fremont General
Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 114.) 
 
At the pleading stage, Plaintiff’s
allegations are sufficient. Demurring Parties’ demurrer is overruled.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Demurring Parties’ demurrer is
OVERRULED.
 
            Defendant
is ordered to file an ANSWER within 5 days’ notice of this ruling. 
 
            Moving
Party to provide notice.
