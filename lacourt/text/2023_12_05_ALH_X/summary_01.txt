And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by the defendants (MJ4 Capital, LLC and Jay E. Davenport) is overruled. The demurrer was based on the argument that the plaintiff (Venken LLC) failed to allege that it obtained a certificate of occupancy, which is required for a breach of contract claim. The judge found that the plaintiff's allegations are sufficient at the pleading stage and that the demurrer is not justified. The defendants are ordered to file an answer to the complaint within 5 days of receiving notice of this ruling.
