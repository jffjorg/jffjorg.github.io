English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to disqualify counsel, filed by plaintiff JINHEE CHO against defendant WOO YEON LEE. The motion is denied. The court found that there is no evidence that counsel, John Oh, ever represented plaintiff, and therefore, there is no conflict of interest or breach of confidentiality. The court also found that the email submitted by plaintiff in support of the motion was not properly translated and therefore, the court could not consider it. The court concludes that the motion is denied as there is no evidence to support the claims of disqualification.
