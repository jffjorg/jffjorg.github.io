And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motions filed by the defendants, Michael Aaron Lalezarian, M.D. and Michael Aaron Lalezarian, M.D. Corp., to compel the plaintiff, Jose Solis, to provide responses to their Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, Requests for Production, and Requests for Admissions. The judge has also ordered the plaintiff to provide verified responses without objections within 30 days after the date of this order.

The judge has imposed sanctions of $765 against the plaintiff, which are due within 30 days after the date of this order. The judge has also ordered the defendants to provide notice and to file proof of service of such notice within five court days after the date of this order.

The judge's ruling is based on the fact that the plaintiff has failed to provide any response to the defendants' discovery requests, despite being served with them. The judge has also noted that the plaintiff is now self-represented, but has found that the plaintiff had notice of the discovery requests and this motion.

The judge has cited various California codes and rules of court in support of its ruling, including Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.260, 2030.290, 2031.300, and 2033.280, and California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348.
