  Case Number:  21STCV20309    Hearing Date:   October 11, 2023    Dept:  78 Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles Department 78  JOSE SOLIS,Plaintiff; vs. MICHAEL AARON LALEZARIAN, M.D., et al., Defendants.  Case No.:  21STCV20309 Hearing Date:  October 11, 2023   [TENTATIVE] RULING RE: MOTIONS TO COMPEL PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSES TO FORM INTERROGATORIES, SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES, AND REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION, AND TO DEEM REQUESTS FOR ADMISSIONS ADMITTED, ALL SET TWO FILED BY DEFENDANTS MICHAEL AARON LALEZARIAN, M.D. AND MICHAEL AARON LALEZARIAN, M.D. CORP.Defendants Michael Aaron Lalezarian and Michael Aaron Lalezarian Corp.’s motions to compel discovery and to deem requests for admissions admitted (eight motions in total) are granted. With respect to the discovery requests which are not requests for admissions, Plaintiff is ordered to provide verified responses without objections within 30 days after the date of this order.The Court imposes sanctions in the amount of $765 against Plaintiff.  Sanctions are due within 30 days after the date of this order.Moving party to provide notice and to file proof of service of such notice within five court days after the date of this order.FACTUAL BACKGROUNDThis is an action for medical malpractice arising from medical treatment Plaintiff received in February 2020.PROCEDURAL HISTORY On June 1, 2021, Plaintiff Jose Solis filed his Complaint against Dr. Michael Aaron Lalezarian, Michael Aaron Lalezarian, M.D., Corp., Vascular Management Associates, Inc., and Andrew L.Camarena, DPM.On September 10, 2021, Plaintiff dismissed Vascular Management Associates, Inc. from this action.On September 29, 2021, Defendants answered.On March 13, 2023, Defendants Michael Aaron Lalezarian and Michael Aaron Lalezarian Corp. filed the instant motions to compel Plaintiff’s responses to written discovery.On July 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed a substitution of attorney stating he is representing himself.DISCUSSIONDefendants Michael Aaron Lalezarian and Michael Aaron Lalezarian Corp. (collectively “Lalezarian”) moves for orders compelling Plaintiff’s responses to FROGs, SROGs, and RPDs, and to deem RFAs admitted.Compelling Responses to InterrogatoriesWithin 30 days after service of interrogatories, the party to whom the interrogatories are propounded shall serve the original of the response to them on the propounding party, unless on motion of the propounding party the court has shortened the time for response, or unless on motion of the responding party the court has extended the time for response. (Code Civ. Proc. section 2030.260, subd. (a).)If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and for a monetary sanction. (Code Civ. Proc section 2030.290, subd. (b).) The statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel where no responses have been served. All that needs be shown in the moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been served. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905-906.)A party waives its objections to a discovery request when it does not serve a timely response to the request. (Code Civ. Proc. 2030.290(a)) Even if objections do not need to be verified, objections will be waived if the responding party “fails to file any response within the statutory time period.” (Food 4 Less Supermarkets, Inc. v. Superior Court (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 651, 658.)Compelling Response to Demand for Production of Documents  Where there has been no timely response to a demand for the production of documents, the demanding party may seek an order compelling a response. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subd. (b).) Failure to timely respond waives all objections, including privilege and work product. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subd. (a).) Thus, unless the party to whom the demand was directed obtains relief from waiver, he or she cannot raise objections to the documents demanded. There is no deadline for a motion to compel responses. Likewise, for failure to respond, the moving party need not attempt to resolve the matter outside court before filing the motion. Deem Requests for Admissions AdmittedWhere there has been no timely response to requests for admissions, a “requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with section 2023.010).”  The court “shall” grant the motion to deem requests for admission admitted “unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(c).) ObjectionsA party waives its objections to a discovery request when it does not serve a timely response to the request. (Code Civ. Proc., section 030.290(a)) Even if objections do not need to be verified, objections will be waived if the responding party “fails to file any response within the statutory time period.” Food 4 Less Supermarkets, Inc. v. Superior Court (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 651, 658.VerificationUnverified discovery responses are tantamount to no response at all, and are subject to a motion to compel responses (rather than a motion to compel further responses).  (Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal. App. 3d 632, 635-36.) However, objections to interrogatories and demands for production are not required to be verified because “objections are legal conclusions interposed by counsel, not factual assertions by a party.” (Blue Ridge Insurance Co. v. Superior Court (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 339, 345.)SanctionsSanctions may be imposed for misuse of discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a). ) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery constitutes a misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348 provides that a court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery even if no opposition was filed. Sanctions are mandatory in connection with a motion to deem matters specified in a request for admissions as true and motions to compel responses to interrogatories and requests for production of documents against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel unless the court “finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c), 2033.280(c).) Sanctions are mandatory in connection with motions to deem requests for admissions admitted if a party to whom the requests for admissions have been directed failed to serve a timely response to the request for admission. (Code Civ. Proc., §2033.280(c).)Here, Lalezarian’s counsel testifies that on January 10, 2023, the he served Lalezarian’s Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, Requests for Production, and Requests for Admission, all Set Two, on Plaintiff. (Karsaz Decl., ¶6.) The responses were due on February 13, 2023. (Id., ¶7.) After receiving no response, counsel sent correspondence to Plaintiff’s counsel inquiring after the late responses. (Id., ¶¶8-9.) Plaintiff’s counsel did not respond to the discovery requests or to Defendants’ counsel’s correspondence. (Id., ¶10.)Because Plaintiff has not provided any response to Lalezarian’s second set of requests for written discovery, the motions to compel Plaintiff’s responses are granted. The same analysis applies to Lalezarian’s motions to deem requests for admissions admitted. The genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in Plaintiff’s motion are admitted.  The Court notes that Plaintiff is now self-represented. Because Plaintiff was represented by counsel at the time the discovery requests and this motion were served and because Plaintiff voluntarily signed a substitution of attorney, the Court is satisfied that Plaintiff had notice of the discovery requests and this motion.Since the motion is unopposed, the Court awards sanctions in the amount of $765 (3 hours of attorney time at $235 per hour plus $60 filing fee) pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Sections 2023.010 and 2023.030, as well as CRC 3.1348. Sanctions are also mandatory because Plaintiff failed to serve a timely response to Lalezarian’s requests for admissions.DATED:  October 11, 2023___________________________Hon.
