ANALYSIS
 
I.          Motion
to be Relieved as Counsel
A.        Legal Standard 
The
Court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should
be granted, provided that there is no prejudice to the client, and it does not disrupt
the orderly process of justice. (See Ramirez
v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 403-407.)
 
A
motion to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Council Form MC-051
(Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed
Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) The
requisite forms must be served “on the client and on all parties that have
appeared in the case.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362, subd. (d).)
 
B.        Analysis 
 
            The
Court finds that Counsel has demonstrated a sufficient basis for permitting
withdrawal at this time. Counsel indicates that Stix wishes for Counsel to
withdraw from representation. (Steinberg Decl., ¶ 2.) If the client requests
the attorney to withdraw, the attorney should oblige. (See Cal. Rules of
Professional Conduct, rule 1.16, subd. (a)(4).) Moreover, although Stix is a
corporate entity, the Court may grant a motion to be relieved as counsel, even
if it leaves the corporate client without representation. (See Gamet v.
Blanchard (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1276, 1283-1284.)
 
            The
Court otherwise finds Counsel has submitted the proper Judicial Council forms
per Rule 3.1362 of the California Rules of Court, and they are all properly
completed. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e); Motion;
Declaration; Proposed Order.) The Court also notes that the Motion, i.e.,
Judicial Council Form MC-051, provides notice to Stix of the subsequent need to
retain representation given Stix’s status as a corporate entity. (See Motion, ¶¶
4-6; Gamet, supra, 91 Cal.App.4th at p. 1284 n. 5.) 
 
            Based on
the foregoing, the Court GRANTS the Motion. The Court will further set an Order
to Show Cause Re: Status of Representation as to Defendant Stix to permit Stix
time to find new legal representation.
 
III.       Conclusion 
            
            The Court GRANTS the Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel without prejudice. 
 
The Court further sets an Order to Show Cause Re: Status of
Defendant Stix Holdings, LLC’s  Legal Representation
for April 11, 2024 at 9:30 a.m.  in
Department 25 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
 
 
The Court's Ruling and Attorney's relief as Counsel of
record for client is not effective until Proof of Service of the Order signed
by the Court upon the client is filed in this action.  Until then, counsel continues to be counsel
of record.  Cal. Rules of Court
3.1362(e). 
 
 
The Court orders Counsel to give
notice of the Court’s ruling within five days of this Court’s order.
