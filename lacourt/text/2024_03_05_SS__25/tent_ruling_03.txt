 
BACKGROUND
 
On April
20, 2020, Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company
(“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendants Daniel Laurence Sabah
(“Sabah”), Aydin Karzar aka Aydin Hajir (“Karzar”) (collectively “Defendants”)
and DOES 1 to 10 alleging a cause of action for subrogation. 
 
On August
31, 2020, Defendant Sabah filed his Answer and Cross-Complaint against Karzar. 
 
On March
31, 2021, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Leave to File an Amended Complaint and
the Court, on its own motion, continued the hearing on such motion to September
15, 2021. 
 
On
September 7, 2021, Plaintiff filed a joint stipulation between itself and
Defendant Karzar indicating that the parties had reached a settlement in the
case for $2,260.00 and requested the case dismissed without prejudice. 
 
On
September 14, 2021, the Court ordered the dismissal of the case without
prejudice pursuant to the Stipulation for Dismissal with the Court retaining
jurisdiction pursuant to CCP § 664.6. 
 
  On
December 5, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal and
Enter Judgment (the “Motion”) pursuant to CCP § 664.6. Plaintiff seeks entry of
judgment as to Defendant Sabah. (Motion, p. 1:22-2:7.) 
 
On
January 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Memorandum of Costs. 
 
On February
1, 2024, without hearing and adopting its tentative ruling as the order of the
Court, the Court continued the hearing on the Motion to March 5, 2024 and
ordered Plaintiff to “file and serve supplemental papers consistent with the
Court’s ruling.” (02/01/24 Minute Order, p. 7.) The Court stated that
Plaintiff’s failure to file supplemental papers would “result in the Motion
being placed off-calendar or denied.” (02/01/24 Minute Order, p. 7.) 
 
The Court
noted that “the settlement agreement that purports to be between Plaintiff and
Defendant Sabah is signed by Defendant Karzar, and not Defendant Sabah.
Moreover, paragraph 2 of that agreement provides that Defendant Karzar shall
pay Plaintiff $2,260 in full settlement of this action rather than Defendant
Sabah.” (02/01/24 Minute Order, p.7.) The Court stated that the moving papers
and proposed order request payment and judgment with respect to Defendant
Sabah. (02/01/24 Minute Order, p.7.) 
 
The Court
found that payment and judgment were rightly sought as to Defendant Karzar
rather than Defendant Sabah; however, the Court ordered Plaintiff to submit
supplemental papers before it could grant the Motion. (02/01/24 Minute Order,
p.7.) The Court analyzed the Motion on its merits only as to Defendant Karzar.
(02/01/24 Minute Order, p. 5.) 
 
No
opposition brief has been filed. Critically, Plaintiff has not filed any
supplemental papers addressing the Court’s identified deficiencies concerning
the Motion. Plaintiff has only filed a notice of continued hearing date
concerning the Motion, which was filed on February 9, 2024. Plaintiff has not
complied with the Court’s February 1, 2024 order. The defects concerning the
Motion still exist. 
 
MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
            Plaintiff
requests that the Court vacate the dismissal entered on September 14, 2021, and
enter judgment against Defendant Sabah in the sum of $1,934.50 for the
following: principal amount of $2,260.00, less $700.00 in payments made by
Sabah, plus court costs totaling $374.50. Plaintiff argues that Sabah made
monthly payments in the amount of $700.00 pursuant to the stipulation; however,
Sabah has since defaulted on payments. On September 11, 2023, Plaintiff mailed
a default letter to Sabah regarding the missed payments and Sabah has failed to
bring his payments current.  
 
OPPOSITION
 
            No
opposition brief was filed. 
 
 
REPLY
 
            No reply
brief was filed. 
 
 
 
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
I.          Vacating
the Dismissal and Entering Judgment  
A.               
Legal Standard 
“Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6
provides a summary procedure to enforce a settlement agreement by entering
judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.” Hines
v. Lukes (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1174, 1182. “[I]f the parties to
pending litigation enter into a settlement either in writing signed by the
parties or orally before the court, the court, upon a motion, may enter
judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.” Ibid. “The court
retains jurisdiction to enforce a settlement under the statute even after a
dismissal, but only if the parties requested such a retention of jurisdiction
before the dismissal.” Ibid. “Such a request must be made either in
writing signed by the parties or orally before the court.” Ibid. 
“A court ruling on a motion under Code
of Civil Procedure section 664.6 must determine whether the parties entered
into a valid and binding settlement.” Ibid. “A settlement is enforceable
under section 664.6 only if the parties agreed to all material settlement
terms.” Ibid. “The court ruling on the motion may consider the parties’
declarations and other evidence in deciding what terms the parties agreed to.” Ibid.
“If the court determines that the parties entered into an enforceable
settlement, it should grant the motion and enter a formal judgment pursuant to
the terms of the settlement.” Ibid. Code Civ. Proc. § 664.6 “expressly
provides for the court to enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the
settlement.” Id. at p. 1183. 
B.        Discussion  
In support of the Motion, Plaintiff’s
counsel, Harlan M. Reese (“Reese”), declares that on September 3, 2021,
Plaintiff and Defendant Sabah entered into a Settlement Agreement and
Stipulation for Dismissal (the “Agreement”), in which Defendant Sabah agreed to
make monthly payments to settle this matter. (Reese Decl., ¶ 2; Exhibit A.)
This action was dismissed on September 7, 2021 with the reservation to vacate
and enter judgment upon breach. (Reese Decl., ¶ 3; Exhibit B.) Defendant Sabah
made monthly payments pursuant to the Agreement totaling $700.00 but has since
defaulted on the payments. (Reese Decl., ¶ 4.) Pursuant to the terms of the
Agreement, on or about September 11, 2023, Plaintiff mailed Defendant Sabah a
default letter regarding the missed payments. (Reese Decl., ¶ 5; Exhibit C.) 
 The Court finds
that Plaintiff’s memorandum of points and authorities, proposed order, and
declaration of counsel request entry of judgment against Defendant Sabah. Defendant
Sabah, however, did not sign the Agreement as such agreement is only between
Plaintiff and Defendant Karzar. (Reese Decl., Exhibit A.) The Court cannot
enter judgment against Defendant Sabah because he was not a party to the
Agreement. Moreover, as stated above, Plaintiff has not corrected the defects
identified by the Court in its February 1, 2024 order. The Agreement
contradicts counsel’s statement in her declaration that Plaintiff and Defendant
Sabah entered into a settlement agreement. The Court finds that there is not a
binding settlement agreement between Plaintiff and Defendant Sabah based on the
record before the Court. 
 
The Motion is therefore DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE. 
 
 
II.        Conclusion 
            
            In sum, Plaintiff’s motion is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.  
 
            Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
