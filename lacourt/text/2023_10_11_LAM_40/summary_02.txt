And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants American Honda Motor Co., Inc.'s motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings. The motion was filed in response to the lawsuit filed by Dayane Flores Olmedo and Claudia Olmedo against American Honda and others, alleging claims of violation of the Song-Beverly Act and breach of express and implied warranty.

The Judge finds that there is a valid arbitration agreement between the parties based on the lease agreement for a 2020 Honda HR-V. The agreement allows American Honda to invoke the arbitration clause against the Plaintiffs' claims.

The Judge also finds that the arbitration clause is enforceable, as it contains a clear and unmistakable delegation to the arbitrator to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, construction, enforceability, and applicability of the arbitration clause.

As a result, the Judge grants American Honda's motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings. The court will stay the action pending the outcome of the arbitrability determination. If the arbitrator determines that the Plaintiffs' claims against American Honda are arbitrable, the action will remain stayed until a final outcome is reached in the arbitration or until the court otherwise specifies.
