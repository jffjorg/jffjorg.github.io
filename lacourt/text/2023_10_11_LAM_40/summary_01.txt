And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to grant the motion to approve the PAGA settlement, with modifications. The settlement agreement provides for a gross settlement amount of $180,950, which will be reduced by $63,332.50 for counsel's fees, $2,026.50 for counsel's costs, and $4,000 for settlement administrator costs. The net settlement amount will be $111,591, which will be distributed 75% to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency (LWDA) and 25% to the aggrieved employees.

The judge found that the settlement agreement is the result of arms-length bargaining and is fair and reasonable. The fees sought by Plaintiff's counsel are also reasonable, and the court has granted the motion to approve the settlement and enter judgment.

The judge has also appointed Phoenix Class Action Administration Solutions as the settlement administrator and has ordered that $1,805 of the administrator fee allocation of $4,000 be returned to the net settlement amount and factored in recalculating the payments to the LWDA and aggrieved employees.

The court will inquire at oral argument as to the remaining claims and parties in the action after this order is signed.
