Background
Plaintiff Carlos Morales, as an
aggrieved employee, and on behalf of all other aggrieved employees under the
Labor Code Private Attorneys’ General Act of 2004 (the PAGA), sues Defendants
Green Land Metals, Inc. (Green Land), Sergio Mejia (Green Land’s CEO), and Does
1 through 30 pursuant to a May 24, 2022 First Amended Complaint alleging claims
of (1) Disability Discrimination in Violation of FEHA [Fair Employment and
Housing Act], (2) Failure to Prevent Discriminatory Practices in Violation of
FEHA, (3) Wrongful Termination In Violation of Public Policy, (4) Failure to
Provide Reasonable Accommodations in Violation of FEHA, (5) Failure to Engage
In A Good Faith Interactive Process, (6) Retaliation, (7) Failure to Pay Wages,
(8) Failure to Pay Overtime Wages, (9) Failure to Compensate for Missed Meal
Periods, (10) Failure to Compensate for Missed Rest Periods, (11) Failure to
Pay Earned Wages Upon Separation, (12) Failure to Furnish Accurate Wage
Statements, (13) Violation of Business & Professions Code § 17200, (14)
Failure to Reimburse Business Expenses, and (15) Civil Penalties Under Labor
Code Section 2699, et seq.
On February 14, 2023, the parties
initiated settlement discussions concerning Plaintiff’s PAGA claim. Defendant
agreed to share records and data with Plaintiff’s counsel, and the parties continued
with negotiations through June 30, 2023, at which time the parties reached a
settlement.
On September 15, 2023, Plaintiff
Carlos Morales moved for an order approving settlement under California Labor
Code PAGA and entering judgment thereon. The motion attaches the settlement
agreement as Exhibit B to the declaration of Michael C. Robinson.
The motion is unopposed and is now
before the Court.
 
Motion to Approve PAGA Settlement
Legal
Standard
The
PAGA is “a procedural statute allowing an aggrieved employee to recover civil
penalties—for Labor Code violations—that otherwise would be sought by state
labor law enforcement agencies.” (Amalgamated Transit Union, Local 1756,
AFL-CIO v. Superior Court (2009) 46 Cal.4th 993, 1003.) The statute
provides a mechanism for private enforcement of Labor Code violations for the
public benefit. (See Arias v. Superior Court (2009) 46 Cal.4th 969,
986.)  
 To incentivize employees to bring PAGA
actions, the statute provides aggrieved employees 25 percent of the recovered
civil penalties. (Lab. Code § 2699, subd. (i).) The remaining 75 percent is
distributed to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency (LWDA) “for
enforcement of labor laws and education of employers and employees about their
rights and responsibilities under [the Labor Code].” (Lab. Code § 2699, subd.
(i).) 
 In reviewing the terms of a settlement
agreement, the court determines whether the settlement is fair, reasonable, and
adequate to all concerned, and not the product of fraud, collusion, or
overreaching. (Reed v. United Teachers Los Angeles (2012) 208
Cal.App.4th 322, 337; Nordstrom Commission Cases (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th
576, 581.) Although a PAGA plaintiff need not satisfy class action requirements
(see Arias v. Superior Court, supra, 46 Cal.4th at p. 975),
general principles applicable to class action settlements apply equally in this
context. In the context of a class action settlement, the court considers
various factors including whether (1) the settlement is the result of arm’s
length bargaining, (2) investigation and discovery are sufficient to allow
counsel and the court to act intelligently, (3) counsel is experienced in
similar litigation, and (4) the percentage of objectors is small. (Nordstrom
Commission Cases, supra, at p. 581; Wershba v. Apple Computer,
Inc. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 224, 245.) In considering the amount of
settlement, the court is mindful that compromise is inherent and necessary in
the settlement process. (Wershba v. Apple Computer, Inc., supra,
at p. 250.)
Order
Approving PAGA Settlement: GRANTED, with Modifications.
I. Summary of Settlement
The
terms of the settlement involve approximately 30 aggrieved employees, with a
PAGA period of March 6, 2023 through the entry of the Court’s order, a gross
settlement amount of approximately $180,950 (subject to an escalator clause), with
reductions of $63,332.50 in Plaintiff’s counsel’s fees (subject to an escalator
clause), $2,026.50 in Plaintiff’s counsel’s costs, and $4,000 in settlement
administrator costs, for a net settlement of $111,591. The net settlement will
be distributed 75% to be paid to the California Labor and Workforce Development
Agency (LWDA) and 25% to the aggrieved employees, for commensurate payment
amounts of $83,693.25 and $27,897.75. The distribution to the aggrieved
employees is to be made on a pro rata basis according to the number of pay periods
worked by each PAGA member from March 6, 2021 to the date of the Court’s entry
of an order approving the settlement (the PAGA period), with the aggrieved employees
comprised of all current and former hourly-paid, non-exempt employees who were
employed by Defendant in the State of California at any time during the PAGA period.
The funding of the settlement amount will take place no later than 14 days
after the Court enters Plaintiff’s proposed order and the judgment is final. Any
section 1542 waiver is only extended to Plaintiff Morales. (Mot., p. 4; Mot.,
Robinson Decl., ¶¶ 9-26, Ex. B, Settlement Agreement, §§ 1, 3-5.) According to
the escalator clause, should the PAGA Pay periods increase by more than 10% by
the date of the entry of the Approval Order, Defendant will have the option to
either increase the gross settlement amount by 10% of shorten the release
period to alleviate any increase in the gross settlement amount. 
II.
Fairness, Reasonableness, and Adequacy & Fraud, Collusion, and Overreaching
Plaintiff
argues that the settlement should be found to be fair and reasonable for
various reasons: Plaintiff complied with the necessary Labor Code
administrative requirements; the settling parties reached a compromise through
arms-length negotiations; sufficient investigation and discovery by experienced
counsel to act competently in negotiating settlement; the settlement is
reasonable in light of the parties’ legal positions, the risk of continued
litigation, and the underlying purpose of the PAGA. (Mot., pp. 9-14; see Mot.,
Robinson Decl., ¶¶ 27-37.)
No
opposition is on file.
The
Court finds that the settlement before the Court is a result of arms-length
bargaining. A declaration from Plaintiff’s counsel explains the parties’
negotiations. The negotiations included, among other things, a determination by
Plaintiff’s counsel that Defendants faced a maximum statutory penalty estimated
at $500,000 and a consideration of the risks of litigation and viability of
defenses to Plaintiff’s claims, to determine that the gross settlement of
$180,950 was fair and reasonable. (Mot., Robinson Decl., ¶¶ 30-34.)
III. Proof of Service
A
proposed PAGA settlement must be submitted to the LWDA at the same time that it
is submitted to the court for review and approval. (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd.
(l)(2).)
Here,
Plaintiffs provide a copy of an electronically filed September 13, 2023 Notice
to the LWDA Regarding Proposed PAGA Settlement, thus satisfying this statutory
section. (Mot., Robinson Decl., Ex. C.)
IV. Administrator Appointment and Costs
The
proposed settlement contemplates using the services of Phoenix Class Action
Administration Solutions (Phoenix) as the neutral party that will administer
the settlement. (See Mot., Robinson Decl., Ex. B, Settlement Agreement, §§
1.2-1.3, 7.1-7.4.) Phoenix is allocated $4,000 for its services per the terms
of the settlement agreement. (Id. at § 3.2.2.)
 Pheonix itself has provided a declaration from
Jodey Lawrence, Phoenix’s President of Business Development, which explains the
qualifications and experience of Phoenix to be an administrator, the protection
of class data, and procedures for notice preparation and distribution. Such
distribution would include identification of the addresses of the aggrieved
employees (including by skip tracing if necessary), mailing a notice of
settlement to the aggrieved employees, and providing court-approved notices and
translations to aggrieved employees. (Mot., Lawrence Decl., ¶¶ 1-16, Exs. A-B
[respectively, Phoenix’s company curriculum vitae, and breakdown of fee not to
exceed $2,195].
The
Court GRANTS the settlement insofar as it seeks appointment of Phoenix Class
Action Administration Solutions as the settlement administrator. Phoenix Class
Action Administration Solutions is ORDERED APPOINTED as settlement
administrator.
Because
Phoenix will only charge $2,195 for its services, the Court ORDERS $1,805 of
the administrator fee allocation of $4,000 returned to the net settlement
amount and to be factored in recalculating the payments to the LWDA and
aggrieved employees. (Mot., Robinson Decl., Ex. B, Settlement Agreement, §
3.2.2; see Proposed Order, § 6.c.)
V. Enhancement Award
The
motion seeks no enhancement award.
VI. Attorney’s Fees and Costs
Plaintiff’s
motion seeks confirmation of $63,332.50 of the settlement agreement’s gross
settlement to Plaintiff’s counsel’s fees and $2,026.50 to Plaintiff’s counsel’s
costs. Counsel’s declaration provides grounds in support of the requested fees
and costs, including counsel’s extensive experienced in class action and PAGA
actions, counsel’s aggressive litigation approach and sponsorship of settlement
discussions, counsel’s procedural litigation efforts, counsel’s skill and time
expended on necessary tasks, the contingent nature of the case, and other
grounds for reasonability. Counsel’s declaration provides that the applicable
fee rate is $500 per hour and that counsel worked over 280 hours in this
action, totaling $140,000 in possible fees, but only seeking $63,332.50
instead, thus supporting reasonableness. Counsel also explains that the
$2,026.50 in costs are comprised of filing fees, expert witness fees, and other
costs associated with the action, including $500 in future costs that will be
necessary in order to successfully resolve this action, costs associated with
the filing of this motion, and additional costs for filing declarations
following distribution of the gross settlement amount. (Mot., Robinson Decl.,
¶¶ 38-51.)
The
Court finds that the fees sought are reasonable in light of the representations
by Plaintiff’s counsel, which are entitled to deference and adequately explain
the grounds for the fees request here. (See Sommers v. Erb (1992) 2
Cal.App.4th 1644, 1651 [fees awarded based on attorney’s representation as to
hours actually spent on contingency fee representation where no time records
were available].) The fee rate of $500 per hour is reasonable for a
practitioner of more than thirty years in the Los Angeles area. (Mot., Robinson
Decl., ¶ 31.) The Court notes that at a rate of $500 per hour, $63,332.50 in
fees yields 126.665 total hours expended by Plaintiff counsel in this PAGA
action. Such hours are reasonable for recovery in light of the 11 or so months
litigated in this action on behalf of nearly 30 aggrieved employees under the
Labor Code, with a reasonable return on the civil penalties that could be
imposed on Defendants. (See Sections I and II above.)
The
Court thus GRANTS the settlement insofar as it relates to attorney’s fees and
costs related to Plaintiff’s counsel’s work.
VII. Discussion Conclusion
The
motion to approve PAGA settlement is thus GRANTED, with Modifications, as
stated above. 

Conclusion
Plaintiff Carlos Morales’s Motion
for an Order Approving Settlement Under California Labor Code Private Attorneys
General Act and Entering Judgment is GRANTED, with Modifications, as stated
above.
The Court would be inclined,
subject to oral argument, to sign Plaintiff Morales’s proposed order with two
modifications: changing the net settlement amount figure to $113,396 ($111,591
plus $1,805); and changing the administrator fees to $2,195. (See Proposed
Order, ¶¶ 6-6(c).)
The Court will inquire at oral
argument as to the remaining claims and parties in the action after this Order
is signed.
