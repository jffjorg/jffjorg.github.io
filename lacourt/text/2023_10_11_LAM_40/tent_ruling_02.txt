DAYANE FLORES OLMEDO and CLAUDIA OLMEDO,

AMERICAN HONDA MOTOR CO., INC., a California Corporation, and
  DOES 1 through 10, inclusive,

 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc.’s Motion to Compel Arbitration
  and Stay Proceedings.



 
Background
Plaintiffs Dayane Flores Olmedo and Claudia Olmedo sue Defendant
American Honda Motor Co., Inc. and Does
1 through 10 pursuant to an October 4, 2022 Complaint alleging claims of (1)
Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty and (2) Violation of
Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Implied Warranty.
The claims arise from allegations that, among other things, on August 20,
2020 Plaintiffs entered a warranty contract with American Honda related to a
2020 Honda HR-V (Vehicle) and that the Vehicle manifested nonconformities
during the warranty period—e.g., brakes, exterior, and suspension defects and
nonconformities—which Honda was unable to conform to warranty within a
reasonable number of attempts.
On August 9, 2023, American Honda
moved to compel arbitration in this action pursuant to the terms of Plaintiff’s
lease agreement for the Vehicle. The signatories to that agreement are Plaintiff
Dayane Flores [Olmedo] and Honda of Downtown Los Angeles (the dealership).
On September 28, 2023, Plaintiffs
opposed the motion.
On October 4, 2023, American Honda
replied to the opposition.
American Honda’s motion is now
before the Court.

Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay Proceedings
Legal
Standard
The
Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), while a federal statute, applies in California
courts and requires state courts to enforce arbitration agreements as required
by the federal common law developed under the FAA. (See Southland Corp. v.
Keating (1984) 465 U.S. 1, 15-16; Broughton v. Cigna Healthplans
(1999) 21 Cal.4th 1066, 1074-78, superseded by statute on another ground as
stated in Ferguson v. Corinthian Colleges, Inc. (9th Cir. 2013) 733 F.3d
928, 937.).) The FAA preempts and invalidates state law and state judicial
decisions that disfavor arbitration or require arbitration provisions to pass
higher scrutiny. (Southland Corp. v. Keating, supra, at p. 12; Perry
v. Thomas (1987) 482 U.S. 483, 490.) If the parties designate the FAA
applies, then California arbitration law is preempted. (See, e.g., Rodriguez
v. American Techs., Inc. (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 1110,
1121-1122.) However, courts have found that where the FAA is found not to
apply, the California Arbitration Act (Code Civ. Proc. § 1280 et seq.) applies.
(See Valencia v. Smyth (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 153, 178.)
 A
court’s inquiry is limited to a determination of (1) whether a valid
arbitration agreement exists and (2) whether the arbitration agreement covers
the dispute. (9 U.S.C. § 4; Chiron Corp. v. Ortho Diagnostics Systems, Inc.
(9th Cir. 2000) 207 F.3d 1126, 1130; Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc.
(2002) 537 U.S. 79, 84; see Simula, Inc. v. Autoliv, Inc. (9th Cir.
1999) 175 F.3d 716, 720 [if the finding is affirmative on both counts the FAA
requires the Court to enforce the arbitration agreement in accordance with its
terms].) “An order to arbitrate the particular grievance should not be denied
unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is
not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.” (United
Steelworkers of America v. Warrior & Gulf Navigation Co. (1960) 363
U.S. 574, 582-583.) 
 Moreover,
the general rule is that the FAA governs all agreements to arbitrate in
contracts “involving interstate commerce.” (Higgins v. Superior Court
(2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1238, 1247.) The term “involving” commerce “is broad and
is indeed the functional equivalent of “affecting’ commerce.” (Allied-Bruce
Terminix Companies, Inc. v. Dobson (1995) 513 U.S. 265, 273-274.) The
defendant bears the burden of proving applicability of the FAA by showing that
its activities constitute interstate commerce. (Hoover v. Am. Income Life
Ins. Co. (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 1193, 1207.) Failure to demonstrate that
the agreement affects interstate commerce renders the FAA inapplicable. (See Lane
v. Francis Capital Management LLC (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 676, 687-688; Woolls
v. Superior Court (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 197, 212.)
Even
where the FAA governs the interpretation of arbitration clauses, California law
governs whether an arbitration agreement has been formed in the first instance.
(Baker v. Osborne Development Corp. (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 884,
893.) 
 The
party seeking arbitration has the “burden of proving the existence of a valid
arbitration agreement by a preponderance of the evidence.” (Ruiz v. Moss
Bros. Auto Group, Inc. (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 836, 842.) “Once that burden
is satisfied, the party opposing arbitration must prove by a preponderance of
the evidence any defense to the petition.” (Lacayo v. Cataline Restaurant
Group Inc. (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 244, 257.) “The trial court sits as the
trier of fact, weighing all the affidavits, declarations, and other documentary
evidence, and any oral testimony the court may receive at its discretion, to
reach a final determination.” (Ruiz v. Moss Bros. Auto Group, Inc., supra,
at p. 842.) 
On
a petition to compel arbitration, the court must grant the petition unless it
finds (1) no written agreement to arbitrate exists, (2) the right to compel
arbitration has been waived, (3) grounds exist for revocation of the agreement,
or (4) litigation is pending that may render the arbitration unnecessary or
create conflicting rulings on common issues. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2; see Condee
v. Longwood Management Corp. (2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 215, 218-219.)
In
determining the enforceability of an arbitration agreement, the court considers
“two ‘gateway issues’ of arbitrability: (1) whether there was an agreement to
arbitrate between the parties, and (2) whether the agreement covered the
dispute at issue.” (Omar v. Ralphs Grocery Co. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th
955, 961.) If these issues are satisfied in favor of the movant, (3) the party
opposing arbitration must prove by a preponderance of the evidence any defense
to the petition. (Lacayo v. Cataline Restaurant Group Inc., supra,
38 Cal.App.5th at p. 257.)
Order
Compelling Arbitration and Staying Proceedings: GRANTED.
I.
Whether
Arbitration Agreement Exists
“Parties
are not required to arbitrate their disagreements unless they have agreed to do
so. [Citation.] A contract to arbitrate will not be inferred absent a ‘clear
agreement.’ [Citation.] When determining whether a valid contract to arbitrate
exists, we apply ordinary state law principles that govern contract formation.
[Citation] In California, a ‘clear agreement’ to arbitrate may be either
express or implied in fact. [Citation.]” (Davis v. Nordstrom, Inc. (9th
Cir. 2014) 755 F.3d 1089, 1092-93 [applying California law].) The court is only
required to make a finding of the agreement’s existence, not an evidentiary
determination of its validity. (Condee v. Longwood Management Corp., supra,
88 Cal.App.4th at p. 219.)
Here,
American Honda argues that it has standing to invoke the arbitration clause in Dayane
Flores and Honda of Downtown Los Angeles’s lease agreement because, though it
is a nonsignatory, the arbitration agreement explicitly allows for “American
Honda Motor Co., Inc.” to invoke the arbitration agreement in that sales
contract, thus making American Honda a third-party beneficiary capable of
invoking arbitration. (Mot., p. 17; see Mot., Vault Decl., Ex. 1, Arbitration
[Plaintiff Dayane Flores “agree[s] that any claim that [she] may have in the
future must be resolved through binding arbitration” where “[Plaintiff], Honda,
or any involved third-party may pursue a claim,” and where “Honda means …
[among other things,] American Honda Motor Co., Inc” …].)
In opposition, Plaintiffs make various
arguments for the proposition that neither of the third-party beneficiary and
equitable estoppel doctrines permit American Honda to invoke the arbitration
agreement. (Opp’n, pp. 3-10.)
In
reply, American Honda argues that the arbitration clause explicitly includes
American Honda and allows them to compel arbitration pursuant to the lease
agreement. (Reply, pp. 3-5.)
The
Court finds in favor of American Honda.
“‘A
third[-]party beneficiary is someone who may enforce a contract because the
contract is made expressly for his benefit.’” (Jensen v. U-Haul Co. of California (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th
295, 301 (Jensen); see also Civ. Code, § 1559 [“A contract, made
expressly for the benefit of a third person, may be enforced by him …”].) A
person “only incidentally or remotely benefited” from a contract is not a
third-party beneficiary. (Lucas v. Hamm (1961) 56 Cal.2d 583, 590.) To
show the contracting parties intended to benefit it, a third party must show
that, under the express terms of the contract at issue and any other relevant
circumstances under which the contract was made: (1) “the third party would in
fact benefit from the contract”; (2) “a motivating purpose of the contracting
parties was to provide a benefit to the third party”; and (3) permitting the
third party to enforce the contract “is consistent with the objectives of the
contract and the reasonable expectations of the contracting parties.” (Goonewardene
v. ADP, LLC (2019) 6 Cal.5th 817, 830.) 
The
lease agreement for the Vehicle is clear. First, American Honda Motor Co., Inc.
may benefit from the lease agreement’s arbitration clause, which includes
American Honda within the meaning of “Honda,” thus facially allowing American
Honda to invoke the arbitration agreement against Plaintiff’s claims. (Mot.,
Vault Decl., Ex. 1, Arbitration ¶ 52.) Second, a motivating purpose of the
lease agreement for the Vehicle must have been to benefit American Honda
because American Honda is listed as a party that can invoke the arbitration
clause through American Honda’s inclusion in the definition of “Honda.” Third,
permitting American Honda to move for arbitration pursuant to the lease
agreement’s terms is consistent with the objectives of the contract and within
the reasonable expectations of the parties because the definition of “Honda”
within the context of the arbitration agreement includes “American Honda Motor
Co., Inc.” 
The
fact that American Honda is specifically listed as a party that can invoke the
arbitration clause thus distinguishes this case from Ford Motor Warranty
Cases (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324, rev. granted, July 19, 2023. There, by
contrast, the court found “there is no basis to conclude that the Plaintiffs
and the dealers entered into [the agreements] with the intention of benefitting
[Ford Motor Company].” (Id. at p. 1329.) By contrast, here, there is.
The
Court thus determines that there is an arbitration agreement between Plaintiffs
and American Honda based on the arbitration clause in the lease agreement for
the Vehicle, which shows grounds for finding that American Honda is a
third-party beneficiary of that lease agreement’s arbitration clause.
II.
Scope
of, and Defenses to, the Arbitration Agreement
“‘[P]arties
may agree to have an arbitrator decide not only the merits of a particular
dispute but also ‘“‘gateway’ questions of ‘arbitrability,’ such as whether the
parties have agreed to arbitrate or whether their agreement covers a particular
controversy.”’ [Citation.] But ‘[c]ourts should not assume that the parties
agreed to arbitrate arbitrability unless there is “clea[r] and unmistakabl[e]”
evidence that they did so.’ [Citation.] This is a ‘heightened standard,’ and it
‘pertains to the parties’ manifestation of intent, not the agreement’s
validity.’ [Citation.]” (Najarro v. Superior Court (2021) 70 Cal.App.5th
871, 879-880 (Najarro).) 
However,
“[c]ourts have held that ‘there is no clear and unmistakable delegation to the
arbitrator’ to decide arbitrability where the contract ‘includes a severability
clause stating a court of competent jurisdiction may excise an unconscionable
provision.’” (Id. at p. 880.) “In other words, pursuant to an exception
…, if a severability clause states that a court may excise
unconscionable provisions, the delegation clause does not meet the heightened
standard necessary for enforcement, because it is no longer clear that only the
arbitrator may decide issues such as unconscionability.” (Ibid.
[emphasis in original]; accord. Aanderud
v. Superior Court (2017) 13 Cal.App.5th 880, 891 [“‘There are two
prerequisites for a delegation clause to be effective. First, the language of
the clause must be clear and unmistakable. [Citation.] Second, the delegation
must not be revocable under state contract defenses such as fraud, duress, or
unconscionability.’ [Citations.]”].)
Here,
American Honda argues that the arbitration clause in the lease agreement for
the Vehicle contains a delegation clause that assigns to the arbitrator the
power to rule on “all issues relating to the interpretation, construction,
enforceability and applicability of th[e] [arbitration clause] provision.” (Mot.,
p. 18, citing to Mot., Vault Decl., Ex. 1, Arbitration.)
Plaintiffs’
opposition and American Honda’s reply thereafter fail to raise arguments
related to this point.
The
Court finds in favor of American Honda.
The
arbitration clause at issue specifies that “[t]he arbitrator shall … decide all
issues relating to the interpretation, construction, enforceability and
applicability of th[e] [arbitration clause] provision” and that the “arbitrator
may order relief permitted by law.” The arbitration clause completely fails to
mention severability or revocability based on things like fraud, duress, or
unconscionability. (Mot., Vault Decl., Ex. 1, Arbitration.) Thus, there is a
clear and unmistakable delegation to the arbitrator relating to the scope of
and defenses to the enforcement of the arbitration agreement. As such, this
Court does not have the authority to rule upon those questions.
American
Honda’s motion is accordingly GRANTED.
III.
Stay
of Action
“If
a court of competent jurisdiction, whether in this State or not, has ordered
arbitration of a controversy which is an issue involved in an action or
proceeding pending before a court of this State, the court in which such action
or proceeding is pending shall, upon motion of a party to such action or
proceeding, stay the action or proceeding until an arbitration is had in
accordance with the order to arbitrate or until such earlier time as the court
specifies.” (Code Civ. Proc., 1281.4.)
Here,
the Court finds it appropriate to STAY this action pending the outcome of the
arbitrability determination. If the arbitrator determines that Plaintiffs’
claims against American Honda are arbitrable, the action will remain STAYED
until a final outcome is reached in the arbitration or until the Court
otherwise specifies. 

Conclusion
Defendant American Honda Motor Co.,
Inc.’s Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay Proceedings is GRANTED.
The Court STAYS this action pending
the outcome of the arbitrability determination. If the arbitrator determines
that Plaintiffs’ claims against American Honda are arbitrable, the action will
remain STAYED until a final outcome is reached in the arbitration or until the
Court otherwise specifies.
