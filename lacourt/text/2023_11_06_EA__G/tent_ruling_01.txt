TENTATIVE
RULING
 
Plaintiff City of El Monte’s Application for Default
Judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This is a nuisance abatement action. In November 2018, the
El Monte Police Department was executing a search warrant at a property in El
Monte when they discovered a commercial marijuana grow operation that was being
conducted illegally.
 
On June 7, 2021, the City of El Monte (the City) filed a
complaint against Dan Tu Cun, Jian Zou, Eagle Home Mortgage, LLC (Eagle Home
Mortgage), and Does 1-100 alleging the following causes of action: (1)
narcotics abatement, (2) public nuisance, (3) violation of El Monte municipal
code, (4) violation of Unfair Competition Law, and (5) violation of MAUCRSA. On
February 6, 2022, the City’s registered process server served Cun and Zou with
substitute service in El Monte. On February 15, the City’s process server
personally served Eagle Home Mortgage in North Palm Beach, Florida.
 
On May 27, 2022, default was entered against Cun and Zou. On
February 16, 2023, default was entered against Eagle Home Mortgage. On April 25,
the City submitted an application for default judgment. On May 17, the court
denied the City’s application.
 
On August 24, 2023, the City submitted the present
application for default judgment. An OSC Re: Default Judgment is set for
November 6.
 
LEGAL STANDARD

Code of Civil Procedure section 585 permits
entry of a default judgment after a party has filed to timely respond or
appear.  A party seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a
Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2)
declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested;
(3) interest computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and
disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a dismissal of all parties
against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment
under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (7)
exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by
statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of Court 3.1800.)
 
ANALYSIS
 
The City seeks default judgment against Cun
and Zou in the total amount of $7,595,802.12, including $7,571,500 in damages, $15,143.50
in attorney fees, and $9,158.62 in costs. For the following reasons, the court DENIES the
City’s application without prejudice.
 
“Plaintiffs in a default judgment proceeding must prove
they are entitled to the damages claimed.” (Kim v. Westmoore
Partners, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, 288, quoting Barragan v.
Banco BCH (1986) 188 Cal.App.3d 283, 302.)¿A party may not obtain damages
in a default judgment that exceed the amount requested in the complaint. (Greenup
v. Rodman (1986) 42 Cal.3d 822, 826.) In determining the maximum amount of
damages allowable, “courts must look to the prayer of the complaint¿or¿to
‘allegations in the body of the complaint of the damages sought’ to determine
whether a defendant has been informed of the ‘maximum liability’ he or she will
face for choosing to default.” (People ex rel. Lockyer v. Brar (2005)
134 Cal.App.4th 659, 667, quoting National Diversified Services, Inc. v.
Bernstein (1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 410, 417-418.)
 
In this case, while the City’s application requests $7,571,500 in
damages, the City’s Complaint only appears to request $2,618,020 or $1,309,010
for each of the Defendants. The court traces this discrepancy to two requests.
First, the City requests a total of $4,752,300 in damages for its fifth
cause of action. (Whittemore Decl., ¶ 14.) The City
arrives at this number by multiplying a penalty of $6,510 by three hundred
sixty five days for each Defendant. (Whittemore Decl., ¶ 14.) In the City’s
Complaint for each of the other causes of action, the City
alleged the penalty requested and provided a minimum total. But for the fifth
cause of action, the City failed to do so and only requested a $6,510 penalty for
each defendant without specifying the minimum total requested. (Prayer, ¶ 20.)
As a result, the court finds the City
is limited to a recovery of $13,020 on this cause of action unless the City
amends the Complaint to include its request of $2,376,150 against each
Defendant.
 
Second, the City requests $214,200 in disgorged profits
based upon the value of the marijuana seized. (Whittemore Decl., ¶ 10.) But
while the City’s Complaint requests all proceeds from Defendants’ alleged
marijuana operation, it fails to specify an
amount. (Prayer, ¶ 11, 14, 17.) Thus, the City
cannot obtain this amount without specifying it in the Complaint.
 
CONCLUSION

Based on the
foregoing, the City’s application for default judgment is DENIED without
prejudice.
