And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The City of El Monte seeks default judgment against Dan Tu Cun, Jian Zou, and Eagle Home Mortgage, LLC, in the amount of $7,595,802.12, including $7,571,500 in damages, $15,143.50 in attorney fees, and $9,158.62 in costs. The court denies the City's application for default judgment without prejudice. The City's request for damages exceeds the amount requested in the complaint, and the court finds that the City is limited to a recovery of $13,020 on one cause of action and cannot obtain $214,200 in disgorged profits without specifying the amount in the complaint. The court orders the City to amend the complaint to include its request for damages and to specify the amount of disgorged profits sought.
