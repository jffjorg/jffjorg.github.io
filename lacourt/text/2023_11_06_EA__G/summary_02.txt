And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The petitioner, Evelyn Aguilar, is seeking approval of a $200,000 settlement reached between her and Hacienda La Puente Unified School District (HLPUSD) on behalf of her client, John Roe, a minor who was allegedly sexually abused by another student at Kwis Elementary School. The settlement agreement provides that HLPUSD will pay $200,000 to Roe, and Roe's attorney will receive 35% of the gross recovery as attorney fees. However, the court has ordered the attorney to provide an itemization or estimate of the total hours worked in the case, as the current petition does not provide this information. The hearing on the petition is continued to a date to be determined at the hearing set in Department G (Pomona), and Roe's counsel is ordered to file a supplemental declaration with the court providing the requested information no later than nine court days before the next scheduled hearing.
