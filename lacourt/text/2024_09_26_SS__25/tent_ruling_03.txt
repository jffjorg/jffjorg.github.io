ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background
 
On August 22, 2023, arbitrator John A. Bonello from the
American Arbitration Association, issued a Final Award of Arbitrator in favor
of Petitioner Forward Financing LLC (“Petitioner”) and against Respondents Fusion
Exotics, Inc. dba Fusion Exotics and Gaston Gutierrez (“Respondents”) in the
sum of $29,755.20.  (Pet. ¶¶ 6-8, pp. 18-19.)
 
On April 22, 2024, Petitioner filed the instant Petition to
Confirm Arbitration Award (“Petition”) as to Respondents.
On
August 26, 2024, the Court noted that Respondents were not properly served with
the Petition and Notice of Hearing and continued the hearing on the Petition.
 
On August 27, 2024, Petitioner filed proof that the
Petition was personally served on Respondents.
 
On August 28, 2024, Petitioner filed Declaration re:
Compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section 1286.
 
On
September 5, 2024, Petitioner filed proof of serving the Notice of Hearing on
Respondents.
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
II.                
Legal
Standard
 
Once
arbitration is concluded, “any arbitrator’s award is enforceable only when
confirmed as a judgment of the superior court.” 
(O’Hare v. Municipal Resource Consultants (2003)
107 Cal.App.4th 267, 278.).  Any of the parties may file a
petition with the court, which must then “confirm the award, correct and
confirm it, vacate it, or dismiss the petition.” 
(Code of Civil Proc. §§ 1285, 1286; EHM
Productions, Inc. v. Starline Tours of Hollywood, Inc. (2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 1058, 1063.)  “It is well settled that the scope of judicial review
of arbitration awards is extremely narrow.”  (California
Faculty Assn. v. Superior Court (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 935, 943.)  “Neither the
trial court, nor the appellate court, may ‘review the merits of the dispute,
the sufficiency of the evidence, or the arbitrator’s reasoning, nor may we
correct or review an award because of an arbitrator’s legal or factual error,
even if it appears on the award’s face.” 
(EHM Productions, supra, at p.
1063-64.)
 
Code of Civil Procedure, section
1285.4 states: “A petition under this chapter shall:
 
(a)   Set forth the substance of or have
attached a copy of the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies the
existence of such an agreement.
(b)   Set forth the names of the
arbitrators.
(c)   Set forth or have attached a copy of
the award and the written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.
 
Moreover, Code of Civil Procedure,
section 1283.6 provides that: “The neutral
arbitrator shall serve a signed
copy of the award on each party to the arbitration personally or by registered
or certified mail or as provided in the agreement.”  (Emphasis added.)  In addition, a party may seek a court
judgment confirming an arbitration award by filing and serving a petition no
more than four years, but not less than 10 days, after the award is served.  (Code
Civ. Proc.  §§ 1288, 1288.4.)
Code of Civil Procedure, section
1290.4, the statute governing proper service of this Petition states, in
pertinent part: 
 
“(a) A copy of the petition and a written notice of the time and place
of the hearing thereof and any other papers upon which the petition is based shall be served in the manner provided
in the arbitration agreement for the service of such petition and notice.
 
(b) If
the arbitration agreement does not provide the manner in which such service
shall be made and the person upon whom service is to be made has not previously
appeared in the proceeding and has not previously been served in accordance
with this subdivision: ¶ (1) Service within this State shall be made in the
manner provided by law for the service of summons in an action.
 
III.             
Discussion 
 
Petitioner
and Respondents entered into a Future Receipts Sale Agreement containing an
arbitration provision governing disputes between the parties arising out of the
Agreement.  (Pet. ¶ 4, Attach. 4(b).) 
A copy of the agreement is filed as Attachment 4(b) and indicates that any
disputes or claims would be settled by arbitration administered by the American
Arbitration Association.  (Ibid.)  Following a dispute between the parties
regarding a breach of the Agreement, on August 22, 2023, arbitrator John A. Bonello, from the American Arbitration
Association, issued an Award of Arbitrator in favor of Petitioner and against
Respondents in the sum of $29,755.20. 
(Pet. ¶¶ 5-8, pp. 18-19, Attach. 8(c).) 
The Award was served on Respondents on August 22, 2023, via first class
mail and email.  (Pet. ¶ 9, Attach.
8(c).)
 
Petitioner requests that the Court confirm the arbitration
award.  (Pet. ¶ 10.)
 
On August 26, 2024, the Court found that the Petition was
filed timely, and Petitioner had complied with nearly all of the requirements
for the instant Petition.  However, the
Court noted that there was no proof that Respondents were served with the
Petition and Notice of Hearing.  For this
reason, the Court continued the hearing and ordered Petitioner to serve
Respondents at least sixteen court days prior to the next scheduled hearing and
to file proof of service with the Court.
 
On August 27, 2024, Petitioner filed proof that the
Petition was personally served on Respondents. 
On September 5, 2024, Petitioner filed a Notice of Hearing, indicating
that the hearing had been set for September 26, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. at the
Stanley Mosk Courthouse, located at 111 North Hill Street, Los Angeles, CA
90012.  Petitioner also filed proof that
the Notice was mailed to Respondents on August 28, 2024.
 
The Court finds that the Proof of Service as to Respondent
Fusion Exotics is incomplete as it does not list the required details regarding
the person or authorized agent served on behalf of the corporation.  Moreover, the Notice of Hearing is defective
as the hearing was scheduled to take place in Department 25 of the Spring
Street Courthouse, located at 312 North Spring Street, Los Angeles, CA 90012.
 
The Court provides Petitioner with one final opportunity to
properly serve Respondents with a Notice of Hearing that lists the correct time
and location of the hearing and to complete the Proof of Service filed as to
Respondent Fusion Exotics.
