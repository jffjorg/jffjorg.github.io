ANALYSIS:
I.                   
Background
On March 29,
2024, plaintiff Ian Wallach (plaintiff) filed suit against defendants Andrew
John Marton and Child & Marton, LLP (collectively defendants) for a single
claim of breach of contract. Plaintiff included no allegations regarding the
contract at issue. Now plaintiff requests leave to file an amended complaint
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 473 and 576. Defendants filed a
notice of non-opposition to the motion. 
 
II.                
Legal Standard 
The Court may, in the furtherance
of justice, and upon any terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any
pleading.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 473,
576.)  There is “a strong policy in favor
of liberal allowance of amendments.” (Mesler v. Bragg Management Co.
(1985) 39 Cal.3d 290, 296.) Thus, the court generally grants requests for leave
to amend unless the party seeking to amend has been dilatory in bringing the
proposed amendment before the Court, and the delay in seeking leave to amend
will cause prejudice to the opposing party. (Hirsa v. Superior Court (1981) 118
Cal.App.3d 486, 490; Higgins v. Del Faro (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 558,
564-565.)  The court may deny a motion
for leave to amend where there is “inexcusable delay and probable prejudice to
the opposing party.” (Magpali v. Farmers Group, Inc. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471,
487 (Magpali) [permitting denial where plaintiff sought to add a new claim on
the eve of trial which would subject defendant to prejudice in trial
preparation].)  
 
III.             
Discussion 
Plaintiff
requests leave to amend to bolster their breach of contract claim.
Specifically, the “privilege concerns regarding attaching the contracts at
issue no longer exist” and, thus, plaintiff requests leave to include the
agreement in the proposed amended complaint. (Mtn., at p. 2:09-11.) Plaintiff
argues Defendants will suffer no prejudice as the amendment serves simply to
clarify Plaintiff’s allegations against Defendants. Defendants filed a notice
of non-opposition and requested ten (10) days to serve their response to the
amended complaint. The court agrees that Plaintiff has demonstrated grounds for
amendment and that there is no prejudice to Defendant in permitting it.
 
IV.             
Conclusion & Order
The Motion for
Leave to File an Amended Complaint filed by Plaintiff Ian Wallach is GRANTED.

 
Plaintiff is
ordered to file the amended complaint within five (5) days’ notice of this
order. 
The proposed amended
complaint submitted on 07/29/2024 WILL NOT be deemed filed. 
 
Defendants have (10)
ten days from the date the First Amended Complaint is filed to file and serve
their response. 
 
Moving party directed is to give
notice.
