And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petition to vacate the arbitration award and has denied the petition on all grounds. The petitioners argue that the award was obtained through corruption, fraud, or unfair means, and that the arbitrator was corrupt or biased. However, the court has found that the petitioners have not provided sufficient evidence to support these claims. Specifically, the court has rejected the petitioners' arguments that the arbitrator was biased due to his refusal to refer to the parties by their legal names, his alleged misconduct during the arbitration hearing, and his failure to disclose a potential conflict of interest. The court has also rejected the petitioners' arguments that the arbitrator exceeded his authority, failed to postpone the hearing or hear evidence useful to settle the dispute, and failed to disclose a ground for disqualification within the time required. The court has concluded that the petitioners have failed to demonstrate that the arbitrator's decisions were arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law, and therefore, the award will not be vacated.
