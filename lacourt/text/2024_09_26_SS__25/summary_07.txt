And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion for leave to file an amended complaint. The plaintiff, Ian Wallach, filed a complaint on March 29, 2024, against the defendants, Andrew John Marton and Child & Marton, LLP, alleging a single claim of breach of contract. The plaintiff has not provided any allegations regarding the contract at issue. The plaintiff is seeking leave to file an amended complaint to include the contract.

The judge notes that there is a strong policy in favor of allowing amendments to pleadings, but the court may deny a motion for leave to amend if the party seeking to amend has been dilatory in bringing the proposed amendment before the court and the delay will cause prejudice to the opposing party.

In this case, the defendants have filed a notice of non-opposition to the motion, and the judge agrees that the plaintiff has demonstrated grounds for the amendment and that there is no prejudice to the defendants in permitting it. The judge grants the motion and orders the plaintiff to file the amended complaint within five days. The defendants have ten days from the date the amended complaint is filed to file and serve their response.
