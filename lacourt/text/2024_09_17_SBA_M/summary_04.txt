And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by The Standard Fire Insurance Companies to the First Amended Complaint filed by Michelle Nichols. The demurrer was sustained with 20 days leave to amend in part and without leave to amend in part. The judge found that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to state a cause of action for negligent hiring, breach of implied warranty of fitness, breach of California Business and Professions Code §7160, and respondeat superior. The judge also found that the complaint lacks specific facts to state a cause of action for fraud. The judge ordered the defendant to give notice of this ruling.
