1.      Paul
Brisson’s, Counsel for Defendant Tim Lee Houzvicka, Motion to be Relieved as Counsel 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            Paul Brisson’s, Counsel for Defendant Tim Lee Houzvicka,
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is granted. 
 
            Background
 
Plaintiff filed the Complaint on August 29, 2023. Plaintiff
alleges the following facts. Plaintiff alleges money owed pursuant to common
counts.  
 
Motion to be Relieved
as Counsel
 
Counsel
states, in the declaration, valid reasons for withdrawal. Counsel states that there
has been a breakdown in communication. The Court finds that the attorney has
filed the required declaration.  The
Court also finds that the attorney has shown sufficient reasons why the motion
to be relieved as counsel should be granted and why the attorney brought a
motion under Code of Civil Procedure § 284(2) instead of filing a consent under
section 284(1). The Court finds that the attorney filed and served the proposed
order. 
 
Therefore, the motion to be relieved as counsel is granted.
 
The attorney is relieved as counsel of record for the client effective
upon the filing of the proof of service of the signed order upon the client. 
 
Paul Brisson is
ordered to give notice of the Court’s ruling.
