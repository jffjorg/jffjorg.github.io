The pickup truck developed electrical problems, and after multiple trips to the dealer, the manufacturer and the dealer agreed to take back the pickup truck and refund the purchase price. The Judge does not believe that her experience will cause her to be biased, but she is providing an opportunity for parties to file a statement of disqualification if they believe otherwise. The Case Management Conference is continued to June 25, 2024, and parties are ordered to file and serve a statement of disqualification if they wish to do so.
