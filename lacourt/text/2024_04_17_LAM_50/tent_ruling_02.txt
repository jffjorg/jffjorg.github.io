[1]The Court notes
that Defendants’ notice of demurrer provides, inter alia, that Defendants
“move the Court for and [sic] order sustaining a general demurrer to the
Unlawful Detainer Complaint filed by Plaintiff without leave to amend.” (Notice
of Demurrer at P1:26-P2:1.) In addition, Defendants’ notice of motion states, inter
alia, that Defendants “move for an order from the court striking the
Complaint for Unlawful Detainer…in this action.” (Notice of Motion at p.
1:26-2:1.) However, a “Complaint for Unlawful Detainer” was not filed in this
action. As discussed above, the Complaint in this action alleges one cause of
action for breach of lease.
