  ORDER RE:
 
DEMURRER TO
  COMPLAINT; 
 
MOTION TO STRIKE
  COMPLAINT FOR UNLAWFUL DETAINER



 
Background
Plaintiffs Northland THEA LLC; Northland THEA Portfolio LLC; Northland
THEA Portfolio II LLC; Northland THEA Portfolio III LLC; and Northland THEA IV
LLC (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed this action on December 15, 2023 against
Defendants Ashley Wynn and Chelsea Wynn (jointly, “Defendants”). The Complaint
alleges one cause of action for breach of lease. 
Defendants appear to demur to the Complaint. Defendants also appear to
move to strike the Complaint.[1]
Plaintiffs oppose both. 
Discussion 
As an initial matter, to
the extent Defendants demur to the Complaint in this action and move to strike
the Complaint in this action, Defendants do not show that they complied with
applicable meet and confer requirements. 
Defendants did not file
any declarations in support of the demurrer or motion to strike demonstrating
that they met and conferred with Plaintiffs in advance of filing the demurrer
and motion to strike. In addition, Plaintiffs’ counsel’s declaration in support
of the opposition provides, inter alia, that “[t]he Wynns did not
attempt to meet and confer with Northland and it’s counsel prior to filing
their Demurrer and Motion to Strike in this case.” (Godwin Decl., ¶ 13.) 
 Pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a), “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the
demurring party shall meet and confer in person, by telephone,
or by video conference with the party who filed the pleading that is
subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be
reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Emphasis
added.) In addition, “[b]efore filing a motion to
strike pursuant to this chapter, the moving party shall meet and confer in
person, by telephone, or by video conference with the party who filed the
pleading that is subject to the motion to strike for the purpose of determining
if an agreement can be reached that resolves the objections to be raised in the
motion to strike.” (Code of Civil Procedure section 435.5, subdivision (a),
emphasis added.) Such meeting and conferring
must be done in good faith with an effort to try to resolve the issues subject
to the demurrer and motion to strike. 
In light of the foregoing,
the hearing on Defendants’
demurrer and motion to strike is continued to _______________, 2024 at 2
p.m. in Dept. 50. 
Defendants
are¿ordered to meet¿and confer¿with Plaintiffs within 10 days of the date of
this order.¿If the parties are unable to resolve the pleading issues¿or if the
parties are otherwise unable to meet and confer in good faith, Defendants are to¿thereafter¿file
and serve¿a declaration setting forth the efforts to meet and confer in
compliance with¿Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41,
subdivision (a)(3) and Code
of Civil Procedure section 435.5, subdivision (a)(3) within 15 days of this order.¿
Defendants are ordered to give notice of this order.
