Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel arbitration in this case. The plaintiff, Farideh Rad, and her family trust brought an action against the defendant, Coastal Capital Group, LLC, alleging elder financial abuse and other claims related to a loan agreement. The defendant claimed that the parties had agreed to arbitrate any disputes arising from the loan agreement, but the plaintiff argued that the loan was made for personal use and was therefore subject to the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), which prohibits mandatory arbitration.

The judge found that the loan was made for personal use and was therefore subject to the TILA. The judge also found that the defendant failed to prove that the loan was made for business purposes, despite the parties' efforts to make it appear that way. The judge noted that the loan was for a consumer credit transaction and that the lender knew or should have known that it was a consumer loan.

The judge concluded that the defendant's motion to compel arbitration was denied, and that the plaintiff was ordered to give notice.
