Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.)¿The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice.  (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)B. AnalysisCounsel filed Civil forms MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053.  Counsel served the moving papers on the client by mail and email on August 19, 2024. (See Proof of Service.)  Counsel confirmed that the addresses are current within the last 30-days through telephone, by conversation, and because the mailing address is the same as that which is the subject of the underlying unlawful detainer action.  (Forms MC-052 ¶ 3(b).)In support of withdrawal, Counsel attests there exists “a complete breakdown of the Attorney-Client relationship resulting in an irreparable breach.” (Form MC-052, ¶ 2.)There is no opposition to the motion. “Good cause” has been adequately demonstrated by Counsel.  In addition, there is no obvious prejudice to Defendant if counsel is relieved at this time.  Hence, the motion is GRANTED.IT IS SO ORDERED.Dated:   September 13, 2024 ___________________________________ Randolph M.
