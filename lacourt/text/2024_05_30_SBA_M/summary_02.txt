And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling of Judge Gary Y. Tanaka grants the motion of Maria Fernanda Bueno Roldan, et al. for leave to file a first amended complaint. The plaintiffs allege that on January 11, 2023, defendant Kevin Sullivan, acting in the course and scope of employment for Swift Transportation, negligently caused a food pallet to fall onto plaintiff Maria Fernanda Bueno Roldan while she was working at Target. The plaintiffs seek to add allegations and a prayer for punitive damages. The defendants objected to the motion, arguing that the newly proposed allegations are insufficient to state a claim for punitive damages and that the plaintiffs have unduly delayed in seeking this amendment. However, the court finds that the plaintiffs have adequately explained the need for the amendment and that there is no prejudice to the defendants. The court grants the motion and orders the plaintiffs to file and serve the first amended complaint within three days.
