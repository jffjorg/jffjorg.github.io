Background
 
Plaintiff’s Complaint was filed on August 9, 2022. Plaintiff
alleges the following facts. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant breached a
deferment program that arose from the COVID-19 crisis regarding his car
payments. Flagship Credit Acceptance, LLC’s default was entered on June 14,
2023.
 
            Demurrer
 
A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a
complaint as a matter of law and raises only questions of law. (Schmidt v.
Foundation Health (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706.)  In testing the sufficiency of the complaint,
the court must assume the truth of (1) the properly pleaded factual
allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably inferred from those expressly
pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39
Cal.3d 311, 318.)  The Court may not
consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law.  (Moore v. Conliffe (1994) 7 Cal.App.4th
634, 638.) Because a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of a complaint, the
plaintiff must show that the complaint alleges facts sufficient to establish
every element of each cause of action.  (Rakestraw
v. California Physicians Service (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.)  Where the complaint fails to state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action, courts should sustain the demurrer.
 (C.C.P., § 430.10(e); Zelig v. County
of Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.App.4th 1112, 1126.)
Sufficient facts are the essential facts
of the case "with reasonable precision and with particularity sufficiently
specific to acquaint the defendant with the nature, source, and extent of his
cause of action.”  (Gressley v.
Williams (1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643-644.)  "Whether the plaintiff will be able to
prove the pleaded facts is irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer."  (Stevens v. Superior Court (1986) 180
Cal.App.3d 605, 609–610.)  Under Code
Civil Procedure § 430.10(f), a demurrer may also be sustained if a complaint is
“uncertain.”  Uncertainty exists where a
complaint’s factual allegations are so confusing they do not sufficiently
apprise a defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet.  (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp.
(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)
Defendant’s default was entered on June
14, 2023. Thus, Defendant is not able to appear in this action until and unless
the default is set aside. 
The Court notes that Plaintiff may have
filed an amended complaint on January 29, 2024. The Court file does not
indicate that an amended complaint was filed.  However, Defendant, with its request for
judicial notice, attached a conformed copy of the First Amended Complaint which
does appear to indicate that it had been filed.  In some instances, the filing of a First
Amended Complaint can open up a default if substantive changes are made in the
amended pleading. Here, the default was not opened up since no substantive
changes were made.
Thus, Defendant’s demurrer and motion to
strike are taken off the court’s calendar.
