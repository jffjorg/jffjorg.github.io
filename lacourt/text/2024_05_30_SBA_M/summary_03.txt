And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Further Responses from Defendant Far East Transportation LLC to Demand for Production of Documents, Set One, and Request for Monetary Sanctions is granted in part and moot in part. The Plaintiff alleged that the Defendants failed to ensure safe transport from the airport terminal to the parking garage, resulting in Plaintiff's fall from a wheelchair. The Plaintiff sought to compel further responses from the Defendant and requested monetary sanctions for the Defendant's failure to comply. The Judge found that the Defendant only served further responses after the Plaintiff incurred time and expense to file the motion to compel, and therefore granted the Plaintiff's request for sanctions. The Judge awarded sanctions in the amount of $1,160.00, payable within 30 days of the date of the ruling.
