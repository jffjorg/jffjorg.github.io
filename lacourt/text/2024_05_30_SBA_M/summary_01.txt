And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has taken Flagship Credit Acceptance, LLC's demurrer to complaint and motion to strike portions of complaint off the court's calendar. The plaintiff, Robert Davis, alleges that the defendant breached a deferment program related to car payments. The defendant's default was entered on June 14, 2023, and the plaintiff may have filed an amended complaint on January 29, 2024. The judge notes that the plaintiff's complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and that the defendant's demurrer and motion to strike are taken off the court's calendar.
