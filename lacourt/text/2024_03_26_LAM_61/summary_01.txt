Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Sohel Sedghat's motion for terminating, issue, and evidentiary sanctions against Defendant City of Los Angeles. Plaintiff claimed that Defendant failed to comply with discovery orders, including failing to provide adequate responses to discovery requests. The judge found that while Defendant's responses were not perfect, they were not entirely evasive or non-compliant. The judge ordered Defendant to provide further responses to two specific discovery requests, but denied Plaintiff's request for sanctions. The judge noted that Plaintiff's motion did not demonstrate a persistent pattern of evasion that would justify terminating sanctions.
