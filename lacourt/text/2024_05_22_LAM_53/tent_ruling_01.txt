MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Richard Rodger Furton         
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
(1)  
Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Responses to Supplemental Interrogatory
(2)  
Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Responses to Supplemental Request for Production of Documents
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with each motion.  No opposition papers were filed. 
MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO
SUPPLEMENTAL INTERROGATORY
Plaintiff Richard Rodger
Furton (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order (1) compelling defendant
Mohammed R. Talai-Shahir (“Defendant”) to serve verified responses to
Plaintiff’s supplemental interrogatory, and (2) awarding sanctions in favor of
Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of $1,800.
If
a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response,
the propounding party may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).)¿¿ 
Plaintiff
served Defendant with Plaintiff’s Supplemental Interrogatory on February 22,
2024, by email.  (Spielfogel Decl., Ex.
1.)  Defendant did not serve a timely
response and had not served a response as of the date that Plaintiff filed this
motion.  (Spielfogel Decl., ¶¶ 5,
6.)  Defendant has not filed opposition
papers or other evidence with the court establishing that a response has since
been served. 
Thus, the
court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s response to Plaintiff’s
supplemental interrogatory.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) 
The court
grants Plaintiff’s request for sanctions. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)  The court finds that $1,060 ((2.5 hours x
$400 hourly rate) + $60 filing fee) is a reasonable amount of monetary
sanctions to impose against Defendant in connection with this motion.  (Spielfogel Decl., ¶¶ 7-8.) 
MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO
SUPPLEMENTAL REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS
Plaintiff moves the court for
an order (1) compelling Defendant to serve responses to Plaintiff’s
supplemental demand for production, and (2) awarding monetary sanctions in
favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of $1,800.
If
a party to whom a demand for inspection is directed fails to serve a timely
response, the party making the demand may move for an order compelling response
to the demand.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §¿2031.300, subd. (b).)¿¿ 
Plaintiff served Defendant with Plaintiff’s Request for Production of
Documents, Set One (Supplemental) on February 22, 2024, by email.  (Spielfogel Decl., Ex. 1.)  Defendant did not serve a timely response and
had not served a response as of the date that Plaintiff filed this motion.  (Spielfogel Decl., ¶¶ 5, 6.)  Defendant did not file opposition papers or other evidence
with the court establishing that a response has since been served. 
Thus, the
court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s response to Plaintiff’s
supplemental request for production of documents.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(b).) 
The court
grants Plaintiff’s request for sanctions. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).)  The court finds that $1,060 ((2.5 hours x
$400 hourly rate) + $60 filing fee) is a reasonable amount of monetary
sanctions to impose against Defendant in connection with this motion.  (Spielfogel Decl., ¶¶ 7-8.)
