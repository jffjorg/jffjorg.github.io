And here is a summary in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling ahead of the March 7, 2024 hearing on the demurrers and motions to strike filed by the Defendants. The ruling notes that the Plaintiff failed to file her oppositions to the demurrers and motions to strike with the Court, despite serving them on the Defendants. The Court was only aware of the oppositions because they were referenced in the Defendants' reply briefs. As a result, the Court has not been able to fully prepare for the hearing. At the hearing, the Court will discuss with counsel for both sides a brief continuance to allow the Plaintiff to file her oppositions and the Court to review them.
