  Case Number:  22STCV23757    Hearing Date:   March 7, 2024    Dept:  57 In preparing for the March 7, 2024 hearing on the multiple demurrers and motions to strike filed by the Defendants, the Court became aware that the Plaintiff apparently served her oppositions to the demurrers and motions to strike on the Defendants but failed to file the oppositions with the Court.   The oppositions do not appear on the docket for this case.    The oppositions apparently were served on the Defendants because the Defendants' reply briefs in support of the demurrers and motions to strike reference the oppositions and address the arguments made in the oppositions.   Because the Plaintiff failed to file her oppositions, the Court has not been able to prepare fully for the hearing on the demurrers and motions to strike.  Accordingly, at the hearing, the Court will discuss with counsel for Plaintiff and Defendants a brief continuance to allow Plaintiff to file her oppositions and the Court to review the oppositions.
