Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's punitive damages claim. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant was negligent in hiring an unfit plumber, failing to inspect the plumber's work, and refusing to share the results of mold and asbestos testing. The defendant argues that the plaintiff's allegations are insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. The court finds that the plaintiff's allegations do not set forth specific facts supporting the elements for fraud and that the plaintiff's punitive damages claim is insufficient. The court grants the plaintiff leave to amend the complaint within 30 days.
