BACKGROUND
Plaintiff GEJ Construction, Inc.,

(Complaint ¶ 9.) Plaintiff provided various credits, leaving a $157,000.00
balance. (Complaint ¶ 10.) Defendant paid Plaintiff a $1,000.00 downpayment and

Plaintiff the remaining balance of $156,000.00. (Complaint ¶¶ 11-13.)
 
On August 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed
a complaint against Defendant and Does 1 to 10, alleging five causes of action
for breach of contract, quantum meruit, open book, account stated, and breach
of covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

On November 13, 2024, Defendant
filed a reply.
 
II.            
DISCUSSION
 
Under both the Federal Arbitration Act and California
law, arbitration agreements are valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, except on
such grounds that exist at law or equity for voiding a contract. (Winter v.
Window Fashions Professionals, Inc. (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 943, 947.)
“[T]he right to arbitration depends upon contract; a petition to compel
arbitration is simply a suit in equity seeking specific performance of that
contract.” (Marcus & Millichap Real Estate Inv. Brokerage Co. v. Hock
Inv. Co. (1998) 68 Cal. App.4th 83, 88.) 
 
The petitioner bears the burden of proving the
existence of a valid arbitration agreement by the preponderance of the
evidence, the party opposing the petition then bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence any fact necessary to demonstrate that there
should be no enforcement of the agreement, and the trial court sits as a trier
of fact to reach a final determination on the issue. (Rosenthal v. Great
Western Financial Securities Corp. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 394, 413; Provencio
v. WMA Securities, Inc., 125 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1031.) The court is
empowered by California Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.2 to compel
parties to arbitrate disputes pursuant to an agreement to do so. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1281.2.)
   
“California law incorporates many of the basic policy
objectives contained in the Federal Arbitration Act, including a presumption in
favor of arbitrability.” (Engalla v. Permanente Medical Group, Inc.
(1997) 15 Cal.4th 951, 971–72.) “This strong policy has resulted in the general
rule that arbitration should be upheld ‘unless it can be said with assurance
that an arbitration clause is not susceptible to an interpretation covering the
asserted dispute.’” (Coast Plaza Doctors Hospital v. Blue Cross of California
(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 677, 686.) Notwithstanding that strong policy, the United
States Supreme Court has held, “[A]rbitration is a matter of contract and a
party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not
agreed so to submit.” (AT & T Technologies, Inc. v. Communications
Workers of America (1986) 475 U.S. 643, 648.)
 
The hearing and determination of a petition to compel
arbitration “in the manner and upon the notice provided by law for the making
and hearing of motions” generally means that “the facts are to be proven by
affidavit or declaration and documentary evidence with oral testimony taken
only in the court's discretion.” (Sonic-Calabasas A, Inc. v. Moreno
(2013) 57 Cal.4th 1109, 1157.)
 

Existence
     of an Arbitration Agreement

 
Defendant submits the contract
between Defendant and Plaintiff (the “Agreement”). (Ex. 1; Evans Declaration ¶
3.) The Agreement contains an arbitration provision, which states:
 
ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES: ANY
CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM ARISING OUT Of OR RELATED TO THIS CONTRACT, OR THE BREACH
THEREOF, SHALL BE SETTLED BY BINDING ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY ARBITRATION RULES OF THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION,
AND JUDGMENT UPON THE AWARD RENDERED BY THE ARBITRATOR(S) MAY BE ENTERED IN ANY
COURT HAVING JURISDICTION THEREOF. CLAIMS WITHIN THE MONETARY LIMIT OF THE
SMALL CLAIMS COURT SHALL BE LITIGATED IN SUCH COURT AT THE REQUEST OF EITHER
PARTY, SO LONG AS BOTH PARTIES LIMIT THEI R RIGHT TO RECOVERY TO THE
JURISDICTION OF THE SMALL CLAIMS COURT. ANY CLAIM FILED IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT
SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO BE A WAIVER OF THE RIGHT TO ARBITRATE, AND IF A COUNTER
CLAIM IN EXCESS OF THE JURISDICTION OF THE SMALL CLAIMS COURT IS FILED IN THE-
MUNICIPAL OR SUPERIOR COURT, THEN THE PARTY ALING IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT MAY
DEMAND ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO THIS PARAGRAPH. 
 
NOTICE: BY INITIALIZING IN THE
SPACE BELOW YOU ARE AGREEING TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF THE MATTERS
INCLUDED IN THE 'ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES' PROVISION DECIDED BY NEUTRAL
ARBITRATION AS PROVIDED BY CALIFORNIA LAW AND YOU ARE GIVING UP ANY RIGHTS YOU
MIGHT POSSESS TO HAVE THE DISPUTE LITIGATED IN A COURT OR JURY TRIAL BY
INITIALIZING IN THE SPACE BELOW YOU ARE GIVING UP JUDICIAL RIGHTS TO DISCOVERY
AND APPEAL, UNLESS THOSE RIGHTS ARE SPECIFICALLY INCLUDED INTHE 'ARBITRATION OF
DISPUTES' PROVISION. IF YOU REFUSE TO SUBMIT TO ARBITRATION AFTER AGREEING TO
THIS PROVISION, YOU MAY BE COMPELLED TO ARBITRATE UNDER THE AUTIJORITY OF THE
BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAWS. YOUR AGREEMENT TO THIS
ARBITRATI ON PROVISION IS VOLUNTARY.
 
(Ex. 1 p. 10.)
 
Accordingly, Defendant has met
their burden of proving a valid arbitration agreement exists.
 

Plaintiff’s Arguments

 
Plaintiff argues Defendant
relinquished their right to arbitration because “Plaintiff reached out to
Defendant numerous times, over an 8-month period, trying to have the payment
issues resolved to no avail. If Defendant believed she had a viable claim, this
should have been resolved prior to Plaintiff initiating his Complaint.
Plaintiff had waited long enough to find alternatives to a civil lawsuit, but
Defendant failed to respond. This is Defendants further attempt to delay
payment to Plaintiff.” (Opposition p. 3.) Plaintiff also argues Defendant
relinquished their right to arbitration because Plaintiff filed a
cross-complaint and “Defendant[‘]s counsel never reached out to Plaintiff’s
counsel to initiate arbitration or even discuss the matter.” (Opposition pp.
3-4.)
 
Plaintiff cites Saint Agnes Medical Center v.
Pacificare of California (2003) 31 4th 1187, which lists factors that the
court should consider to determine whether a party has waived the right to
arbitrate. Saint
Agnes was
overruled by Quach
v. California Commerce Club, Inc. (2024) 16 Cal.5th 562, 582 fn. 4 (“To the extent they are inconsistent
with our analysis, we overrule St.
Agnes Medical Center v. PacifiCare of California, supra, 31
Cal.4th 1187, 8 Cal.Rptr.3d 517, 82 P.3d 727 and overrule or disapprove opinions cited
in St.
Agnes or
relying upon our decision in that case.”) Plaintiff cites no specific authority supporting their
argument that Defendant relinquished the right to arbitrate by failing to
resolve the claim prior to the complaint being filed and by filing a
cross-complaint. 
 

Waiver

 
The court may deny a motion to compel arbitration if it
determines that “[t]he right to compel arbitration has been waived by the
petitioner[.]” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2(b).) 
“To establish waiver under generally applicable contract law, the party
opposing enforcement of a contractual agreement must prove by clear and
convincing evidence that the waiving party knew of the contractual right and
intentionally relinquished or abandoned it.” (Quach v. California Commerce
Club, Inc. (2024) 16 Cal.5th 562, 584.) “Under the clear and convincing
evidence standard, the proponent of a fact must show that it is ‘highly
probable’ the fact is true.” (Id.) “The waiving party’s knowledge of the
right may be ‘actual or constructive.’” (Id.) “Its intentional
relinquishment or abandonment of the right may be proved by evidence of words
expressing an intent to relinquish the right or of conduct that is so
inconsistent with an intent to enforce the contractual right as to lead a
reasonable factfinder to conclude that the party had abandoned it.” (Id.)
“The waiver inquiry is exclusively focused on the waiving party's words or
conduct; neither the effect of that conduct on the party seeking to avoid
enforcement of the contractual right nor that party's subjective evaluation of
the waiving party's intent is relevant.” (Id. at p. 585.)
 
In Quach v. California Commerce Club, Inc, the
Supreme Court of California held that the party seeking to compel arbitration
was aware of its right to compel arbitration because it submitted a declaration
showing the moving party required all employees to sign agreements providing
for binding arbitration, the moving party provided the plaintiff with the
signature page of the arbitration agreement before the plaintiff filed the
suit, and in its answer to the complaint, the moving party asserted that the
arbitration agreement barred the suit. (Quach v. California Commerce Club,
Inc., supra, 16 Cal.5th at p. 586.) The Court also held that the moving
party intentionally abandoned its right to arbitrate because, “[r]ather than
moving to compel arbitration at the outset of the case” the moving party
“answered the complaint and propounded discovery requests, suggesting it did
not intend to seek arbitration.” (Id.) The moving party also requested a
jury trial on its initial case management conference statement – filed three
months after the plaintiff filed the complaint - and left the box indicating it
was “willing to participate” in arbitration blank. (Id.)  Finally, the moving party posted jury fees. (Id.)
Thirteen months after plaintiff filed the complaint, the moving party sought to
compel arbitration. (Id. at p. 587.) 
The Court held that the moving party waived its right to arbitration
because “being fully aware of its right to compel arbitration, [the moving
party] chose not to do so for 13 months, affirmatively indicated its intent to
pursue a jury trial rather than arbitration, and actively engaged in discovery
— words and conduct markedly inconsistent with an intent to arbitrate.” (Id.)
 
First, the record shows that Defendant was aware of its right
to compel arbitration at the outset of this case, given Defendant moved to
compel arbitration at the outset of this case. (See Motion; Ex. 1.)
 
Second, the record does not show that Defendant intentionally
relinquished or abandoned its right to compel arbitration. Plaintiff filed the
complaint August 16, 2024, and the summons on the complaint was filed September
11, 2024. On October 14, 2024, Defendant filed the Motion and cross-complaint.
Thus, unlike Quach v. California Commerce Club, Inc., there is no
evidence here that Defendant participated in litigation and discovery for
months before seeking to compel arbitration or represented they did not intend
to compel arbitration.  In contrast,
Defendant immediately moved to compel arbitration at the outset of this case.
 
Plaintiff also argues it “reached out to Defendant numerous times, over an
8-month period, trying to have the payment issues resolved to no avail[,]”
“[i]f Defendant believed she had a viable claim, this should have been resolved
prior to Plaintiff initiating his Complaint[,]” and “Plaintiff had waited long
enough to find alternatives to a civil lawsuit, but Defendant failed to
respond.” (Opposition p. 3.) To the extent Plaintiff is arguing that Defendant
waived the right to compel arbitration because Defendant failed to move to
compel arbitration before Plaintiff filed this action, Plaintiff cites
no authority supporting that proposition. Moreover, this court finds
Plaintiff’s argument is meritless Plaintiff submits no evidence showing
Defendant’s words or conduct demonstrate Defendant intended to relinquish the
right to compel arbitration. (See Quach v. California Commerce Club, Inc., supra, 16
Cal.5th at p. 585)
 
Thus, this court finds that Defendant did not waive the right
to compel arbitration.
