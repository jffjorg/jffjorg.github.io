  ORDER RE:
 
PLAINTIFFS’
  MOTION FOR ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COSTS PURSUANT TO CIVIL
  CODE SECTION 1794(d)
 



            
Background
Plaintiffs William Burns
and Terri Burns (jointly, “Plaintiffs”) filed this action against Defendant
General Motors, LLC (“GM”) on August 23, 2021. The Complaint alleges causes of action for (1) breach of
implied warranty of merchantability under the Song-Beverly Act, (2) breach of
express warranty under the Song-Beverly Act, and (3) fraudulent inducement -
concealment. On February
14, 2022, the Court issued an Order sustaining GM’s demurrer to the 
third cause of action (fraudulent
inducement – concealment), without leave to amend. 
            On
January 10, 2024, the Court issued a minute order in this matter providing, inter
alia, that “[a] Notice of Settlement was filed January 9, 2024…” In his declaration in support of the
instant motion, Plaintiffs’ counsel states that “[p]ursuant to the Offer
to Compromise signed by Plaintiffs on December 8, 2023, GM agreed (1) to pay
Plaintiff $95,000.00, inclusive of a Two-Times Civil Penalty and additional
damages; (2) that Plaintiffs are the prevailing party; (3) to pay Plaintiffs
pre-judgement interest pursuant to Civil Code §§ 3287(b)
and 3289(b); and (4) that GM would pay Plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees, costs,
and expenses pursuant to Civil Code § 1794(d) by way
of motion.” (Barry Decl., ¶ 19, emphasis omitted.) 
            Plaintiffs now move for an order
awarding their attorney fees, costs, and expenses. GM opposes. 
Discussion  
A.    Procedural Issues 
As an
initial matter, GM filed an opposition to the instant motion on July 18, 2024. As
noted by Plaintiffs in the reply, the July 18, 2024 opposition is 20 pages. 
Pursuant
to California Rules of Court, rule 3.1113, subdivision (d), “[e]xcept
in a summary judgment or summary adjudication motion, no opening or responding
memorandum may exceed 15 pages. In a
summary judgment or summary adjudication motion, no opening or responding
memorandum may exceed 20 pages. No reply or closing memorandum may exceed 10
pages. The page limit does not include the caption page, the notice of motion
and motion, exhibits, declarations, attachments, the table of contents, the
table of authorities, or the proof of service.” (Emphasis added.) 
In
addition, on July 24, 2024, the same day Plaintiffs filed their reply in
support of the motion, GM filed an amended opposition. The Court notes that GM
does not appear to cite any Court order authorizing it to file an amended
opposition. GM’s July 24, 2024 opposition is 14 pages. In their reply, Plaintiffs
assert that “[a]s for the Amended Opposition, though the
pagination appears to meet the 15 page limit, it does not. All the same, GM had
to get permission from this Court to file an oversized briefing. It did not.”
(Reply at p. 3:23-25.) 
As noted by Plaintiffs, pages 7:10-8:6 and 9:1-13:4 of GM’s amended
opposition contain single spaced text. Plaintiffs assert that the “single
spaced arguments…amount to an additional three pages.” (Reply at p. 4:13.) Pursuant
to California Rules of Court, rule 2.108(1), “[t]he
lines on each page must be one and one-half spaced or double-spaced and
numbered consecutively.” Pursuant to California
Rules of Court, rule 2.108(3), “[f]ootnotes, quotations, and
printed forms of corporate surety bonds and undertakings may be single-spaced
and have unnumbered lines if they comply generally with the space requirements
of rule 2.111.” Here, most of the 
single-spaced
text on pages 7:10-8:6 and 9:1-13:4 of GM’s amended opposition does not appear
to consist of quotations. Plaintiffs also note that “[a]
memorandum that exceeds 10 pages must include a table of contents and a table
of authorities.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1113, subd. (f).) GM’s original
opposition and amended opposition do not include a table of contents or a table
of authorities. 
In their
reply, Plaintiffs assert that “if this Court chooses to consider
GM’s Opposition, Plaintiffs request this Court cease its consideration at page
10 of 14 (using the page numbering system found in GM’s Opposition) as it is
truly the 15th page. Should this Court consider GM’s Noncompliant Opposition in
total, Plaintiffs request leave to file a supplemental briefing to all of the
pages this Court considers in GM’s Noncompliant Amended Opposition.” (Reply at
pp. 5:28-6:5.) 
Conclusion 
In light of the foregoing issues, the Court continues the hearing on
Plaintiffs’ motion for attorneys’ fees and costs to ____________, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. in Dept.
50. 
On
or before ____________, 2024, GM is to file amended opposition papers that comply
with the applicable page number, spacing, and other relevant requirements set
forth in California Rules of Court, rules 3.1113 and 2.108. Courtesy copies must be delivered to
Dept. 50. No new evidence or new argument is to be submitted in GM’s amended
opposition papers. 
On
or before ____________, 2024, Plaintiffs may file a new reply brief that will supersede the previously filed reply
papers.
Courtesy copies of any new reply brief AS WELL AS THE MOTION must be
delivered to Dept. 50. Plaintiffs are
ordered to give notice of this Order.¿¿
