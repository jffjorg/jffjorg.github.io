And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by defendant Hugo Rodriguez to the answer of cross-defendants Hilda Bennett, Yolanda Tellez, and Gustavo Rodriguez. The demurrer alleges that the answer is defective and should be stricken. The judge finds that Rodriguez failed to file a declaration demonstrating that he met and conferred with the cross-defendants in advance of filing the demurrer, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41. Therefore, the judge has continued the hearing on the demurrer to a later date and ordered Rodriguez to meet and confer with the cross-defendants within 10 days. If the parties are unable to resolve the issues or meet and confer in good faith, Rodriguez must file a declaration setting forth his efforts to meet and confer within 15 days.
