The parties had previously agreed to dismiss the action, but the plaintiff had retained jurisdiction to enforce the settlement. The plaintiff has filed a motion to enforce the settlement and enter judgment, as the defendant has defaulted on its obligations. The judge has concluded that the settlement agreement was properly executed and that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment in the amount of $119,709.59. The judge will enter a judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant, and the parties are notified to submit on this tentative ruling.
