  CASE NO.: 21STCV29317
 
[REVISED TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING AMENDED
  PETITION TO APPROVE COMPROMISE OF DISPUTED CLAIM WITHOUT PREJUDICE AND CONTINUING
  HEARING
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
November 5, 2024



 
On
August 13, 2024, counsel for Plaintiffs filed a Petition to Approve Compromise of
Disputed Claim.  On August 22, 2024, the Court
issued an order that detailed the Petition’s many deficiencies and continued the
hearing so an amended petition could be filed no later than September 3, 2024.  Plaintiffs did not timely file an amended petition.  Plaintiffs did file a late amended petition on
September 5, 2024.  The amended petition remained
deficient for many of the same reasons as the original petition.  The Court posted a tentative ruling before the
September 10, 2024 hearing that again detailed the Petition’s many deficiencies.  In light of that tentative ruling, Plaintiffs’
counsel represented to the Court that an amended petition would be filed to cure
the defects of the previous Petitions.  The
Court therefore did not adopt the tentative and continued the hearing.
On
October 15, 2024, Plaintiffs’ counsel filed a new Amended Petition.  This Amended Petition continues to have some of
the same deficiencies.  Counsel’s inability
to complete the necessary amendments is unduly delaying approval of the settlement.  The Court will again detail the ongoing deficiencies
in the Amended Petition.
COMPROMISE OF CLAIM
Claimant
Isaias Cervantes, a person with disabilities (by and through his parent, guardian
ad litem, and conservator Rosa Padilla), has agreed to settle his claims against
Defendant County of Los Angeles in exchange for $25 million.  Of this amount, $105,573.75 is allocated for a
Medi-Cal lien, $9.25 million is allocated for attorney fees, and $228,601.70 is
allocated for costs and expenses, leaving a balance of $15,415,824.55 for Claimant.  (This is not the same as the $14,855,824.60 balance
calculated in Item 15 of the Petition.)  If
approved, a portion of the funds will be paid to the guardian or conservator of
the estate and a portion of the funds will be transferred to the trustee of a special
needs trust.
Court
approval is required for all settlements of the claims of people with disabilities.  (Probate Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; Code
Civ. Proc., § 372.)  The Court has reviewed
the proposed settlement and cannot approve it at this time.
Item
15 does not correctly state the balance of proceeds for the Claimant.
Item
11(b)(5) states that Plaintiff Rosa Padilla will receive $500,000 and Plaintiff
Yajaira Cervantes will receive $60,000.  Item
11(b)(1) does state that the total amount offered by all defendants to others is
$560,000.  The settlement agreement states
that Defendant will pay $25 million “in full and final settlement of any and all
claims by the Plaintiffs against the Defendants.”  It therefore appears that Plaintiff Rosa Padilla
and Plaintiff Yajaira Cervantes will receive a portion of the $25 million settlement,
and $25 million is not the amount of Claimant’s own settlement for approval.  (See Item 10(a).)  This is not what the Petition states in Items
10 and 11.
Counsel’s
declarations in support of the reasonableness of attorney fees do not adequately
support the request for $9.25 million (37%) in attorney fees.  Although Claimant’s parent, guardian ad litem,
and conservator contracted with counsel for attorney fees of forty-percent of the
settlement recovery, $9.25 million is excessive in this case.
Counsel
Dove provides a spreadsheet summarizing billing records for his 4,250 hours.  (Dove Decl. ¶ 5 & Ex. 12.)  He calculates his fees based on an hourly rate
of $1,275 and a lodestar multiplier of 1.7 or 1.8.  (Dove Decl. ¶ 58.)  A significant amount time billed (321 hours) was
for the criminal action in Case No. BA499677, not this case.  (Dove Decl., Ex. 12.)
Counsel
Doyle provides a spreadsheet summarizing billing records for his 169.72 hours.  (Doyle Decl. ¶ 3 & Ex. 1; see Dove Decl. ¶
58.)  Counsel Dove calculates his fees based
on an hourly rate of $1,275 and a lodestar multiplier of 1.8.  (Dove Decl. ¶ 58.)
Counsel
Contreras provides sufficiently detailed information for this Court to determine
whether his 393.95 hours were reasonably spent. 
(Contreras Decl. ¶¶ 3-47.)  However,
the Court cannot determine whether his fees are reasonable.  Counsel declares that “the amount of the fee is
xxxxx.”  (Contreras Decl. ¶ 49.)  Counsel Dove calculates his fees based on an hourly
rate of $650 and a lodestar multiplier of 1.75. 
(Dove Decl. ¶ 58.)
Despite
the detailed declarations from counsel, as well as declarations from non-parties
who testify to the quality of counsel’s work, the Court finds that both the hourly
rates and lodestar multipliers are excessive. 
The total amount of time spent by all counsel (without deducting the 321
hours for the criminal action in Case No. BA499677) is 4,813.67 hours.  Based on the requested fees of $9.25 million,
this equals an exorbitant hourly rate of approximately $1,921.61.  Applying counsel’s highest hourly rate ($1,275)
to all hours results in a total award of a little less than $6.14 million.
Based
on the evidence presented (including counsel’s declarations addressing the factors
listed in California Rules of Court, rule 7.955), the Court finds that a
reasonable amount of attorneys fees is $2,246,335.  The Court calculated this total based on a
reasonable hourly rate of $500 for 4,492.67 hours (4,813.67 minus 321 for the
criminal case).
Additionally,
the Proposed Order is incomplete except for the hearing information and identity
of the parties.  The Proposed Order must include
the settlement figures, fees, liens, and other information, including language
approving the funding of the special needs trust.
SPECIAL
NEEDS TRUST
A
portion of Claimant’s funds will be transferred to a special needs trust (“SNT”).  Claimant is the subject of a conservatorships
in a separate case (Case No. BP145994) where Petitioner recently filed a
petition, and obtained an order, to create the subject SNT and fund it with the
settlement proceeds from this case.
When
a settlement proposes the establishment of a special needs or other trust as provided
in Probate Code sections 3600 to 3612, the terms of the proposed trust must be reviewed
by the Probate Department. (L.A. County Sup. Ct. Rule 4.115(c).)  A party seeking to establish and fund a trust
as part of a Petition must, within two court days of the filing of the Petition,
lodge with the filing window of the Probate Division at Stanley Mosk Courthouse
a physical copy of the face page of the Petition, a copy of the proposed trust instrument,
and the proposed order approving the compromise and trust.  (L.A. County Sup. Ct. Rule 4.115(c).)
After
receiving the Probate Department’s recommendation, the Court must review the terms
of the trust and make specific findings. 
(Prob. Code, § 3604.)  On October
31, 2024, the Court received a recommendation from the Probate Department.
As
required by Probate Code section 3604, subdivision (b), the Court makes the
following findings based on the information in the Petition: (1) Claimant has a
disability which substantially impairs his ability to provide for his own care
or custody and constitutes a substantial handicap; (2) Claimant is likely to
have special needs that will not be met without the trust; and (3) the money to
be paid to the trust does not exceed the amount that appears reasonably
necessary to meet Claimant’s special needs.
Notice
of hearing and a copy of the Petition must be mailed to the State Director of
Health Care Services, the Director of State
Hospitals, and the Director of Developmental Services at the
office of each director in Sacramento at least 15 days before the hearing on
the Petition.  (Prob. Code, § 3611, subd.
(c).)  The proof of service for this Petition
does not indicate service upon the state agencies.
CONCLUSION
The
Amended Petition filed on October 15, 2024 is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
The
Hearing on Amended Petition to Approve Compromise of Disputed Claim is CONTINUED
to February 20, 2025 at 8:30 a.m.  An Amended
Petition may be filed no later than January 9, 2025.  The Amended Petition must also be served on
the required state agencies and lodged with the filing window of the Probate Division
at Stanley Mosk Courthouse in accordance with Local Rule 4.115(c).
Moving
party give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
