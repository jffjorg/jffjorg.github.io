And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has sustained Greenspan Adjusters' demurrer to the cross-complaint with 30 days' leave to amend, and granted their motion to strike with 30 days' leave to amend. The judge has also sustained Etehad's demurrer to the cross-complaint in part, with 30 days' leave to amend, and denied their motion to strike.

The judge's ruling is based on the following grounds:

* Greenspan Adjusters' demurrer was sustained because the cross-complaint failed to allege a fiduciary relationship between the parties, and failed to allege fraud with specificity.
* Greenspan Adjusters' motion to strike was granted because the cross-complaint contained conclusory allegations and lacked specificity.
* Etehad's demurrer was sustained in part because the cross-complaint failed to allege a fiduciary relationship between the parties, and failed to allege fraud with specificity.
* Etehad's motion to strike was denied because it was duplicative of the demurrer and not proper for a motion to strike.

The judge has given the parties 30 days to amend their pleadings and has scheduled a hearing on the tentative ruling for November 5, 2024.
