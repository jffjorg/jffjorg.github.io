And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's motion for sanctions against the Defendant, FCA US, LLC. The Plaintiff, Isabel Kilroe, has been seeking discovery from the Defendant since March 22, 2024, but the Defendant has failed to produce the requested documents, including the warranty, owner's manual, diagnostic materials, and communications logs. As a result, the Plaintiff has been unable to prove the Defendant's breach of warranty and willfulness in failing to repurchase or replace the vehicle.

The Judge finds that the Defendant has engaged in misconduct and orders that it must be taken as established that the Plaintiff's vehicle had a defect covered by the warranty that substantially impaired the vehicle's use, value, or safety to a reasonable buyer in her situation, and that the Defendant willfully failed to repurchase or replace the vehicle. The Judge also orders the Defendant to pay monetary sanctions of $6,560.00 to the Plaintiff.
