  CASE NO.: 22STCV22822
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR ENTRY
  OF JUDGMENT
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
November 5, 2024



 
On January 20, 2023, Plaintiff Tech. Finance Co. LLC and
Defendant Information Technology Partners 
filed a stipulation to dismiss this action pursuant to a settlement, with
the Court retaining jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 for
enforcement of the settlement.
On September 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed
a motion to enforce the settlement and to enter judgment.

Courts
may enter judgments pursuant to written settlements signed by the parties.  (Elyaoudayan v. Hoffman (2003) 104 Cal.App.4th
1421, 1428; Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6.)  Strict
compliance with the statutory requirements is necessary before a court can enforce
a settlement agreement.  (Sully-Miller
Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th
30, 37.)  The party seeking to enforce a settlement
“must first establish the agreement at issue was set forth ‘in a writing signed
by the parties’ (§ 664.6) or was made orally before the court.  [Citation.]” 
(Harris v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 299, 304.)
Plaintiff
and Defendant signed a settlement agreement on September 15, 2022.  (Motion, Ex. 3.)  Defendant agreed to pay Plaintiff a total of $178,655.07
in multiple installments through May 2023. 
The parties later executed three amendments to the settlement agreement.  (Motion, Exs. 4-6.)  Defendant has defaulted on its obligations.  (Lyman Decl. ¶¶ 6-7.)
Plaintiff
seeks entry of judgment in the amount of $119,709.59.  This is the total of the $132,766.98 balance as
of the parties’ Third Amendment to Settlement Agreement and any disbursements, payments,
and interest.  (Lyman Decl. ¶ 10; Motion,
Exs. 6, 8.)
The
unopposed motion to enforce settlement is GRANTED.  The Court will enter a judgment in favor of Plaintiff
and against Defendant in the total amount of $119,709.59.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
