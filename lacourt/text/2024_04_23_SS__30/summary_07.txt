And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant has moved to quash the service of the summons and complaint on the grounds that the plaintiff did not validly serve the defendant with the process. The defendant argues that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over him because the plaintiff's first amended complaint was rejected by the court. However, the court finds that the defendant was already within the jurisdiction of the court when the plaintiff served him with the invalid first amended complaint. The defendant has not provided any evidence or argument as to why the initial service on December 16, 2022, was invalid. The court therefore denies the defendant's motion to quash service of the summons and complaint.
