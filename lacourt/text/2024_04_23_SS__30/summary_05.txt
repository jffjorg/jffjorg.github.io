As for the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to tax costs due to inadequate notice. The plaintiff filed the motion on April 2, 2024, and the hearing is set for April 23, 2024. However, according to California Code of Civil Procedure, the notice period is 16 court days, and since the motion was filed, the earliest possible hearing date would be April 26, 2024. Since the notice was not served at least 16 court days before the hearing, the motion is denied.
