 Case Number:  22STCV17276    Hearing Date:   April 23, 2024    Dept:  30 RAMIRO GARCIA, AN INDIVIDUAL vs ARCHDIOCESE OF LOS ANGELES EDUCATION & WELFARE CORPORATION, A CALIFORNIA CORPORATION, et al.TENTATIVEPlaintiff’s motion to tax costs is DENIED for inadequate notice. Defendant is ordered to give notice.Legal StandardA prevailing party is entitled to recover costs, as a matter of right, in any action or proceeding absent a statute expressly noting otherwise. (Cal Civ. Proc. Code § 1032, subd. (b).) Unless a statute provides otherwise, a court has no discretion to deny costs to a prevailing party. (Nelson v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 129). A prevailing party is (i) a party that receives a net monetary recovery, (ii) a defendant who obtains a dismissal in its favor (iii) a defendant, when neither the plaintiff nor defendant attained any relief and (iv) a defendant, where the plaintiff(s) obtains no recovery from the defendant. (Cal Civ. Proc. Code § 1032, subd. (a)(4).)“If the items appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or necessary.” (Ladas v. California State Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal. App. 4th 761, 774.) If the items appear to be proper expenses, they are themselves prima facie evidence that the costs, expenses and services were necessarily incurred. If the items appear proper, it is not enough for the losing party to attack submitted costs by arguing that he thinks the costs were not necessary or reasonable. Rather, the losing party has the burden to present evidence and prove that the claimed costs are not recoverable. (Seever v. Copley Press Inc. (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1550, 1557.) However, when items claimed as costs do not appear on their face as proper and necessary, and the items are properly challenged by a motion to tax costs, the burden of establishing the necessity of the items is on the party claiming them as costs. (See Id.; See also Whitney v. Whitney (1958) 164 Cal.App.2d 577, 585.) “[I]f the items are properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as costs.” (Ladas, 19 Cal.App.4th at 774.)DiscussionPlaintiff moves to tax costs.CCP § 1005(b) provides “all moving and supporting papers shall be served and filed at least 16 court days before the hearing. … However, if the notice is served by mail, the required 16-day period of notice before the hearing shall be increased by five calendar days… if the notice is served by facsimile transmission, express mail, or another method of delivery providing for overnight delivery, the required 16-day period of notice before the hearing shall be increased by two calendar days.”CCP § 1010.6(a)(3)(B) Provides “Any period of notice, or any right or duty to do any act or make any response within any period or on a date certain after the service of the document, which time period or date is prescribed by statute or rule of court, shall be extended after service by electronic means by two court days.”¿Plaintiff filed this motion on April 2, 2024 (and purportedly served it on March 29, 2024), and the hearing is set for April 23, 2024. The earliest the motion could have been heard is April 26, 2024, which is 16 court days plus two court (or calendar) days for email service from the date the motion was filed. Thus, the motion is inadequately noticed and therefore DENIED.
