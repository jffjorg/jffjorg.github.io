Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the defendant's demurrer and finds that the plaintiff's complaint is untimely and barred by the six-month statute of limitations of Government Code § 945.6. The plaintiff presented a claim for damages to the defendant on November 20, 2019, and the claim was rejected on February 21, 2020. The plaintiff was required to file the complaint six months after the notice of rejection, which was August 21, 2020. However, the plaintiff did not file the complaint until April 26, 2022. Therefore, the court sustains the defendant's demurrer and dismisses the complaint without leave to amend.
