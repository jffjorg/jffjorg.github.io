The Court has reviewed the Expedited Petition to Approve Minor's Compromise and has declined to approve it as requested.

The Court has approved the distribution of the settlement proceeds, allocating 30% to attorney's fees, $689.17 to medical expenses, and $3,696.65 to costs. The total settlement amount is $23,500, with a net settlement of $12,064.18 after deducting total fees and costs. The Petition is continued, and counsel is ordered to file a proposed order and order to deposit the settlement proceeds into a blocked account.
