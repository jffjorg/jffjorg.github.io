The Defendant, Uber Technologies, Inc., has filed motions to compel responses to discovery requests and request for sanctions against the Plaintiff, Michael Roth. The Defendant served discovery requests, including Form Interrogatories, Request for Admissions, and Request for Production of Documents, on December 13, 2023. The Plaintiff failed to provide responses to these requests by the deadline of January 17, 2024, and did not request an extension. The Court finds that the Defendant is entitled to a court order directing the Plaintiff to provide verified responses to the discovery requests. Therefore, the motions are granted. However, the request for sanctions is denied as the Defendant's motions were not opposed.
