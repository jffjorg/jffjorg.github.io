And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court has sustained Defendant Kevin De Leon's demurrer without leave to amend, which means that the complaint against him has been dismissed. The court has also taken judicial notice of various documents, including the plaintiff's claim for damages and the notice of rejection. The court's decision is based on the fact that the plaintiff failed to file his complaint within six months after the notice of rejection, as required by Government Code § 945.6. The plaintiff has not shown a reasonable possibility of amending the complaint successfully, so the complaint has been dismissed without leave to amend.
