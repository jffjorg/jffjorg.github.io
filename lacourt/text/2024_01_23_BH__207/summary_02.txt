And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Michael E. Whitaker in the case of SC127147, involving Pacific Carpets, LLC (plaintiff) and Western National Builders (defendant). The case concerns a dispute over costs incurred by Pacific in the litigation. The Court has granted Pacific's motion for summary adjudication, and Pacific has filed a memorandum of costs seeking $1,435.00 in filing and motion fees, $244.27 for service of process, $6,129.00 in surety bond premiums, and $859.20 for "Case Anywhere Pro-Rata Fees Mandated by Court Order".

Western National Builders has moved to tax certain costs as not being reasonably necessary, including $500 in filing and motion fees associated with Pacific's first unsuccessful motion for summary judgment and the entire $6,129.00 in surety bond premiums. The Court has denied Western National Builders' motion to tax costs in its entirety.

The Court finds that Pacific's first unsuccessful motion for summary judgment was "reasonably necessary" to the conduct of the litigation, and that Western National Builders should be responsible for the surety bond premiums because its failure to pay Pacific directly caused Pacific to incur the premiums. The Court also finds that the claims against AMLI (and the corresponding bonded stop notices) are "inextricably intertwined" with the contractual claims against Western National Builders.
