for Production of Documents (Set Two) (“RPD-2”); and Special Interrogatories
(Set Two) (“SROG-2”).  In addition, Defendant

LEGAL
STANDARDS
 
1.      Interrogatories
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
2030.290, “[i]f a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a
timely response . . . [t]he party to whom the interrogatories are directed
waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under Section
2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including one based
on privilege or the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing
with Section 2018.010.  . . .   [and] The party propounding the
interrogatories may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subds. (a)-(b).) 
 
2.      Requests
for Admission
 
             Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (a), “[i]f a party to whom requests
or admission are directed fails to serve a timely response . . .  [t]he party to whom the requests for
admission are directed waives any objection to the requests, including one
based on privilege or on the protection for work product[.]”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).)  Where a party fails to respond to
requests for admissions, the propounding party may move for an order that the
genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction.¿ (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)
 
3.      Requests
for Production
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300, subdivision (a),
“[i]f a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
directed fails to serve a timely response . . . [t]he party to whom the demand
for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection
to the demand, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work
product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010.  . . . [and] The party making the demand may
move for an order compelling response to the demand.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subds. (a)-(b).)  
 
ANALYSIS
 
1.     
Discovery Requests
 
Defendant electronically served Plaintiff with
the FROG-2, RFA-1, RPD-2 and SROG-2 on August 28, 2023.  (See Declarations of John C. Goodman ¶¶
4-5 and Exhibits thereto.)  Plaintiff did not respond to the subject discovery
requests.  (Goodman Decl. ¶ 6.)  Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff
has failed to serve responses to the FROG-2, RFA-1, RPD-2 and SROG-2.
 
2.     
Monetary Sanctions
Defendant
requests monetary sanctions in connection with the motions.  The Court finds Plaintiff’s failure to
respond to the FROG-2, RFA-1, RPD-2 and SROG-2 to be an abuse of the discovery
process, warranting monetary sanctions. 
(See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.010, subd. (d), 2030.290, subd. (c),
2033.280, subd. (c).)  Accordingly, the
Court will impose monetary sanctions against Plaintiff in the amount of $1,250.00,
which represents 5 hours of attorney time to prepare the moving papers and
attend the hearing, at $250 per hour.   
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court grants Defendant’s motions to compel responses to
FROG-2, SROG-2 and RPD-2 per Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and
2031.300.  As such, the Court orders Plaintiff
to serve verified responses to FROG-2, SROG-2 and RPD-2, without objections,
within 30 days of notice of the Court’s orders.
 
Further, the Court grants Defendant’s motion to deem admitted the
truth of matters specified in RFA-1 per Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, and deems admitted the matters
specified in RFA-1 propounded to Plaintiff.
 
Further, the Court orders Plaintiff to pay monetary sanctions in the
amount of $1,250, by and through counsel for Defendant, within 30 days of
notice of the Court’s orders.
 
Defendant shall provide notice
of the Court’s orders and file a proof of service of such.
