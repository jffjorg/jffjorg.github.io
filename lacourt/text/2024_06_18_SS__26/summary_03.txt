Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the Motion for Assignment Order filed by XQB Management, Inc. dba RE/Max One (Judgment Creditor) against Kelly Alexandria Morgan (Judgment Debtor). The judgment creditor seeks an order directing payments from Beverly and Company, Inc. to be made to Judgment Creditor instead of Judgment Debtor. The court finds that the motion for an order of assignment of payments from Beverly and Company, Inc. is proper.

The judge also awards post-judgment attorney's fees of $1,000.00 to Judgment Creditor, as requested in the motion. The award is based on 2.5 hours of attorney time billed at $400.00 per hour. The court grants the motion for an assignment order and awards the requested attorney's fees.
