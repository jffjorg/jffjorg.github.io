MOTION TO DISQUALIFY
COUNSEL(CCP § 128.5; Rules of Professional Conduct Rule 3-7)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendant Irene
Zendano’s Motion to Disqualify Counsel is GRANTED. 
 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
On January 10, 2020, Plaintiff
Basta, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed this action for
“wrongful use of civil proceedings” against Defendant Irene Zendano,
individually and as trustee of the Irene Valerie Zendano Family
Revocable Living Trust U.T.D. May 9, 2015
(“Defendant”). Following Defendant’s failure to
file a responsive pleading, Plaintiff obtained entry of default on August 13,
2021. On February 3, 2022, the Court granted Defendant’s motion to vacate the
entry of default and set an Order to Show Cause Re Proof of Service of Summons
and Complaint for April 6, 2022. (Minute Order, 02/03/22.) On August 1, 2022,
the OSC Re Failure to File Proof of Service was discharged. (Minute Order,
08/01/22.)
 
Defendant,
through a special appearance, filed a Motion to Quash Service of the Summons
and Complaint on August 18, 2022. The Motion to Quash was denied on October 10,
2022, and Defendant filed a Motion to Strike Portions of the Complaint. (Minute
Order, 10/10/22.) The Motion to Strike was denied on March 22, 2023. (Minute
Order, 03/22/23.) During the pendency of various discovery motions, the trial
date was continued multiple times to January 25, 2024. Prior to that trial
date, the parties stipulated to another continuance due to Plaintiff obtaining
new counsel. (Stip and Order, 01/12/24.) 
 
On March 25,
2024, Plaintiff filed a substitution of attorney indicating it would now be
represented by Daniel J. Bramzon (“Bramzon”) of the Law Office of Daniel
J. Bramzon & Associates (“the Bramzon Firm”). At the trial setting
conference on the same date, trial was set for June 24, 2024. Defendant filed
the instant Motion to Disqualify Counsel on April 2, 2024. No opposition has
been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
Defendant moves to disqualify Bramzon and the Bramzon Firm pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5 and Rules of Professional Conduct rule
3-7. Defendant argues that Plaintiff, Bramzon, and the Bramzon Firm constitute
a three-part entity that are inextricably intertwined in this action. In
support of the Motion, Defendant requests that the Court take judicial notice
of the following:
 
(1) Los Angeles County Superior Court
Case No. 17UR0333, Verified Complaint, filed February 10, 2017;
(2) Los Angeles County Superior Court
Case No. 17UR1510, Judgment of the Court, entered July 17, 2017;

Eviction, dated August 8, 2017;
(4) United States Bankruptcy Court for
the Central District of California, Case No. 2:17-bk-13236-BR, Docket No. 17,
filed May 17, 2017, dismissing the petition;
(5) Los Angeles County Superior Court
(Probate Division) Case No. 17STPB02292, Minute Order (May 2, 2018) dismissing
petition with prejudice and Minute Order (April 24, 2018) granting Ms.
Zendano’s motion for terminating sanctions;
(6) United States District Court,
Central District of California, Case 2:18-cv-05154, Docket No. 1, Complaint
filed on June 11, 2018;
(7) United States District Court,
Central District of California, Case 2:18-cv-05154, Docket No. 18-3,
Declaration (under penalty of perjury) of Daniel J. Bramzon in support of
Special Motion to Strike 
(8) Los Angeles County Superior Court,
Case No. 20STCV14784, Complaint filed by BASTA, Inc. against Neal Zaslavsky on
April 16, 2020;
 
(9) On January 11, 2022, the Court
ordered the dismissal of Los Angeles County Superior Court Case No.
20STCV14784; and
(10) Any time to appeal the Court’s
January 11, 2022 order dismissing Los Angeles County Superior Court Case No.
20STCV14784 has expired.
 
The Court takes judicial notice of the filings pursuant to
Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (d), with a caveat. The Court does not
take judicial notice of the truth of the contents of the filings except with
respect to orders, findings of fact, and conclusions of law and judgments. (Sosinsky
v. Grant (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1548, 1564-1566.)
 
Defendant sets forth the following background facts: In
2015, Defendant rented her grandmother’s house in La Puente to her cousin,
Elizabeth Bland (“Bland”). (Motion, RJN, Exh. 1.) Despite providing Bland with
significantly reduced rent and extensions of the lease term, Bland refused to
vacate the premises when the time came. (Ibid.) Following two unlawful
detainer actions, Defendant obtained a judgment of eviction against Bland in
July 2017. (Id. at Exh. 2.) In both unlawful detainer actions, Bland was
represented by Andres Alatorre, an attorney formerly with Plaintiff. (Ibid.)
To avoid eviction, Bland filed petitions for bankruptcy protection and probate
action, both of which were resolved against Bland. (Id. at Exhs. 4 and
5.) Alatorre then went after Defendant for the attorney’s fees she owed
pursuant to the first unlawful detainer action by recording that judgment
against the subject house and preventing Defendant from selling it. Alatorre
brought in Plaintiff, Brazmon, the Brazmon Firm, and attorney Kevin Hermansen
to assist with extorting Defendant for an amount far more than the attorney’s
fees owed, but that Defendant was forced to pay in order to timely sell the
house. Thereafter, Defendant filed a federal action to recover the excessive
overcharge but did not prevail as the district court found the Basta bad
actors’ conduct was protected. (Id. at Exh. 6.) 
 
Plaintiff then filed this action against Defendant for
wrongful use of civil proceedings. At the heart of this action is Bramzon’s
contention that other than providing Hermansen and the Bramzon Firm with a
prepaid express envelope to serve Ms. Zendano with papers related to the case,
Plaintiff was purportedly not meaningfully involved in the effort to extort
money from Defendant. This is supported by the allegations in the Complaint,
which reiterate that Plaintiff’s only involvement with respect to enforcing the
attorney’s fee award from the first unlawful detainer action was to provide
Hermansen an envelope for serving papers. (Compl., ¶¶14-17.)
 
The Motion to Disqualify is brought pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 128.5 on the grounds that an attorney can be
disqualified for violating a disciplinary rule. 
 
a “trial court's authority to
disqualify an attorney derives from the power inherent in every court ‘[t]o
control in furtherance of justice, the conduct of its ministerial officers, and
of all other persons in any manner connected with a judicial proceeding before
it, in every matter pertaining thereto.’ [Citations.]” (SpeeDee Oil, supra, 20
Cal.4th at p. 1145, 86 Cal.Rptr.2d 816, 980 P.2d 371, quoting Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 128, subd. (a)(5).) “The power is frequently exercised on a showing that
disqualification is required under professional standards governing avoidance
of conflicts of interest or potential adverse use of confidential information.
[Citations.] Violation of a disciplinary rule may justify disqualification.
([Citation.]; cf. Gregori v. Bank of America (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 291, 303,
254 Cal.Rptr. 853 ... [(Gregori)] [suggesting disqualification is not
necessarily warranted for violation of a specific disciplinary rule].)”
 
(Jarvis v. Jarvis (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 113, 129.)
Defendant points to Rules of Professional Conduct rule 3-7, which prohibits an
attorney “from acting both as an advocate and a witness in the same
proceeding.” (Kennedy v. Eldridge (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 1197, 1208.)
Specifically, the Rule states:
 
“(a) A lawyer shall not act as advocate
at a trial in which the lawyer is likely to be a necessary witness unless:
“(1) the testimony relates to an
uncontested issue;
“(2) the testimony relates to the
nature and value of legal services rendered in the case; or
“(3) disqualification of the lawyer
would work substantial hardship on the client.”
 
(Rules of Prof. Conduct, rule 3-7.) The factors the Court
must consider are: (1) whether counsel’s testimony is, in fact, genuinely
needed; (2) the possibility opposing counsel is using the motion to disqualify
for purely tactical reasons; and (3) the combined effects of the strong interest
parties have in representation by counsel of their choice, and in avoiding
duplicate expense and time-consuming effort involved in replacing counsel
already familiar with the case. (Smith, Smith & Kring v. Superior Court
(1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 573, 580-581.)
 
These factors weigh in favor of granting the Motion to
Disqualify. The testimony of Bramzon is genuinely needed to provide evidence
regarding Plaintiff’s involvement in the federal action. Indeed, Plaintiff
lists Bramzon as its own first witness. (Witness List, filed 10/10/23, ¶1.) Nor
is there any evidence that defense counsel is using the instant Motion for
purely tactical reasons. Plaintiff has not filed any opposition to the instant
Motion to Disqualify, which also demonstrates it lacks a strong interest in
being represented by its new counsel. The only opposing factor is the
additional expense and time involved in obtaining new counsel for Plaintiff,
which alone, cannot overcome the factors in support of disqualification. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, Defendant Irene Zendano’s Motion to Disqualify Counsel is GRANTED.
 
 
Moving party to give notice.
