Discussion
 
On April 16, 2024,
Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) filed
this action by a Petition for Case Number for Protective Order pursuant to Cal.
Insurance Code section 11580.2. Due to clerical error, the action was set for
trial as if the action were based on a complaint. Accordingly, the Court
vacates the October 14, 2025 trial date and sets an order to show cause
regarding status of arbitration for December 17, 2024 at 9:30 am.
 
On May 24, 2024,
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Compel Attendance at Medical Examination.
No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff moves to
compel Defendant Maria De Jesus Chavez’s (“Defendant”) attendance at an
independent medical examination (“IME”) pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2032.220, which states in relevant part: “In any case in which a
plaintiff is seeking recovery for personal injuries, any defendant may demand
one physical examination of the plaintiff, if both of the following conditions
are satisfied: (1) The examination does not include any diagnostic test or
procedure that is painful, protracted, or intrusive. (2) The examination is
conducted at a location within 75 miles of the residence of the examinee.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.220, subd. (a).) Here, Defendant seeks to recover
damages for injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident that occurred in
December 2019, making the provisions of section 2032.220 applicable in the
uninsured motorist arbitration proceeding. 
 
Plaintiff may move to compel Defendant’s attendance at the
IME pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.250, which states: “If a
defendant who has demanded a physical examination under this article, on
receipt of the plaintiff's response to that demand, deems that any modification
of the demand, or any refusal to submit to the physical examination is
unwarranted, that defendant may move for an order compelling compliance with
the demand.”  Such a motion to compel is
subject to the meet and confer declaration requirement of Section 2016.040.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.250, subd. (a).) 
 
The Motion is supported by a declaration demonstrating a
meet and confer effort regarding Defendant’s IME after they failed to appear
for two separately noticed examinations. (Motion, Tseng Decl., ¶¶4-9 and Exhs. A-F.)
No opposition to the instant Motion has been filed by Defendant justifying
their failure to submit to an IME. Therefore, Plaintiff in entitled to an order
compelling Defendant’s attendance. Also, Plaintiff requests sanctions of $2,060.00
based on five hours of attorney time billed at $400.00, plus $60.00 in costs. (Motion,
Tseng Decl., ¶9.) As no opposition has been filed, however, the sanctions are
reduced to $1,260.00.

Motion to Compel Attendance at Medical
Examination is GRANTED. DEFENDANT MARIA DE JESUS CHAVEZ IS ORDERED TO APPEAR
FOR AN INDEPENDENT MEDICAL EXAMINATION AT A DATE AND TIME DETERMINED BY
PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL, WITHIN 20 DAYS’ NOTICE OF THIS ORDER. DEFENDANT AND
COUNSEL OF RECORD ARE ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $1,260.00 TO PLAINTIFF’S
COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ NOTICE OF THIS ORDER.
