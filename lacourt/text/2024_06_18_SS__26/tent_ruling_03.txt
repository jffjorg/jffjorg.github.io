ANALYSIS:  
 
On February 15, 2023,
Plaintiff XQB Management, Inc. dba RE/Max One (“Judgment Creditor”) filed this action
against Defendants Kelly Alexandria Morgan (“Judgment Debtor) and Beverly and
Company, Inc. Beverly and Company, Inc. was dismissed on July 18, 2023. On
February 28, 2024, this Court entered default judgment against Judgment Debtor
for the total amount of $6,923.61. 
 
Judgment Creditor filed the instant Motion for an Assignment
Order on April 12, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure, section 708.510, subdivision
(a), the moving statute, the Court may order the judgment debtor to assign to
the judgment creditor or to an appointed receiver all or part of a right to
payment due or to become due. The types of payments that can be assigned
include wages due from the federal government if not subject to a withholding
order, rents, commissions, royalties, patent or copyright payments, and
insurance policy loan value. (Code Civ. Proc., § 708.510, subd. (a).)
 
Relevant factors the Court may take into consideration when
making an assignment order include the judgment debtor’s reasonable
requirements if they are a natural person, payments the judgment debtor is
required to make to satisfy other judgments and wage assignments, the amount
remaining due on the judgment, and the amount to be received in satisfaction of
the right to payment that may be assigned. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 708.510, subd. (c).) Construing all the
applicable statutes together, the “assignment order” contemplated by Code of
Civil Procedure, section 708.510, et seq.
must include a court order that assigns a right to payment outright (not simply
an order directing the judgment debtor to do so).  
 
Here, Judgment Creditor seeks an order (1) directing
payments from Beverly and Company, Inc. to Judgment Debtor be
made to Judgment Creditor instead; and (2) directing Beverly and Company to
turn over to Judgment Creditor any funds pursuant to the assignment order.
(Motion, pp. 1:24-2:15.) 
 
On February 28, 2024, judgment was entered in Judgment
Creditor’s favor and against Judgment Debtor in the amount of $6,923.61. (Motion, Malek
Decl., ¶2, Exh. A.) Judgment Debtor has made no payment towards the judgment;
meanwhile interest on the judgment is accruing at $1.89 per day. (Id. at
¶2.) The total amount owed to Judgment Creditor as of the filing of this Motion
is $7,109.50. (Ibid.) The Motion demonstrates that Judgment Debtor is
currently a real estate agent affiliated with Beverly and Company, Inc. (Id.
at Exh. B.) Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Judgment Creditor’s
motion for an order of assignment of payments from Beverly and Company, Inc. is
proper. 
 
Finally, Judgment Creditor seeks
an award of attorney’s fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
685.040. “The judgment creditor
may claim under this section the following costs of enforcing a judgment: . . .
(6)
Attorney's fees, if allowed by Section 685.040.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 685.070, subd. (a).) Code of Civil Procedure, section 685.040 states: “The judgment
creditor is entitled to the reasonable and necessary costs of enforcing a
judgment. Attorney’s fees incurred in enforcing a judgment are not included in
costs collectible under this title unless otherwise provided by
law. Attorney’s fees incurred in enforcing a judgment are included as
costs collectible under this title if the underlying judgment includes an award
of attorney’s fees to the judgment creditor pursuant
to subparagraph (A) of paragraph (10) of subdivision (a) of Section
1033.5.” Also, the motion must be brought with two years of the incurred costs.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 685.080, subd. (a).) 
 
The default judgment in this action included an award of
attorney’s fees, making the request for post-judgment fees appropriate. Judgment
Creditor’s attorney bills at $400.00 per hour, which is reasonable for a breach
of contract action in the limited jurisdiction court. (Motion, Malek Decl.,
¶4.) The attorney spent 2.1 hours preparing the instant Motion and anticipates
an hour to attend the hearing. (Ibid.) Given the Motion is uncontested
and the relief sought is being granted, the appearance time should reasonably
be reduced to 0.4 hours. Accordingly, attorney’s fees are awarded in the amount
of $1,000.00 based on 2.5 hours billed at $400.00 per hour. 
 
Conclusion
 
Judgment Creditor XQB Management, Inc. dba RE/Max One’s Motion
for an Assignment Order is GRANTED. JUDGMENT CREDITOR IS AWARDED POST-JUDGMENT
ATTORNEY’S FEES OF $1,000.00. JUDGMENT CREDITOR’S PROPOSED ORDER IS SIGNED AND
FILED THIS DATE.
