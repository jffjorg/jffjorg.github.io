  CASE NO.: 21STCV34339
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST
  FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
November 13, 2023



 
On September 17, 2021, Plaintiffs Elham Khorsandi and
Sam S. Khorsandi filed this action against Defendants Star Der Parseghian and Star
DP Design, Inc.  On August 3, 2022, the Court
entered default against Defendants.
On November 6 and 7, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a request
for entry of default judgment.
Plaintiffs seek a judgment of $21,749.79, consisting
of 17,726.00 in damages, $2,789.64 in prejudgment interest, and $1,234.15 in costs.
The claimed costs are reasonable and allowable.  The prejudgment interest is also appropriate based
on the claimed damages.
Plaintiff’s damages consist of the $14,000.00 deposit
they paid to Defendants for floor installation that never occurred, plus fees for
“18 extra months of storage fees for the furnishings which were removed from the
area to be tiled, all due to Defendants’ failure to perform as represented.”  (Khorsandi Decl. ¶ 8.)
The Complaint prays for return of the $14,000.00
deposit, plus “[a]dditional storage costs incurred by Plaintiffs.”  Plaintiffs do not plead an amount of damages for
the storage costs.  The Court cannot award more in a default judgment than
the amount demanded in the complaint.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 580, subd. (a).)  In order to
receive a damages award in excess of $14,000.00, Plaintiffs must
file and serve an amended complaint alleging the total amount of economic damages
and obtain a new entry of default on the amended complaint.  (See Electronic Funds Solutions, LLC v. Murphy
(2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1173-1174.) 
Alternatively, Plaintiffs may submit a new request for entry of default judgment
that excludes the unpleaded storage damages.
The request for entry of default judgment is DENIED WITHOUT
PREJUDICE.
An Order to Show Cause Re: Entry of Default Judgment
is scheduled for 03/14/2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 48 at Stanley Mosk
Courthouse.
Moving
