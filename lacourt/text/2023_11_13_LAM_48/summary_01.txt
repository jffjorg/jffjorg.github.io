And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff had requested a judgment of $21,749.79, including damages, prejudgment interest, and costs. However, the court cannot award more in a default judgment than the amount demanded in the complaint, and the plaintiff did not plead an amount of damages for storage costs. The court has scheduled an Order to Show Cause Re: Entry of Default Judgment for March 14, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. The plaintiff may either file an amended complaint alleging the total amount of economic damages or submit a new request for entry of default judgment that excludes the unpleaded storage damages.
