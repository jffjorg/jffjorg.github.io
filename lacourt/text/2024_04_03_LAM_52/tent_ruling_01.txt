  Case Number:  23STCV09164    Hearing Date:   April 3, 2024    Dept:  52 Order to Show Cause Re: Default Judgment
Plaintiff
Travelers Property Casualty Company of America
requests clerk’s judgment against defendant Culichitown Restaurants, Inc., a
California corporation.  A clerk’s
judgment is appropriate in this action for breach of contract “for the recovery
of money or damages only.”  (CCP §
585(a); see Holloway v. Quetel (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1425, 1432.)  Plaintiff meets all requirements for clerk’s
judgment.
Plaintiff
did not, however, request dismissal of defendants Does 1-10.  A request for default judgment must
include “[a] dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought
or an application for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of
Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each
judgment.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a)(7).)  Plaintiff does not seek
default judgment against the Doe defendants. 
They therefore must be dismissed. 

The court hereby dismisses defendants Does 1-10
without prejudice.
The court
hereby grants plaintiff’s request for default
judgment.  The clerk shall sign the proposed judgment plaintiff
submitted on form JUD-100.
