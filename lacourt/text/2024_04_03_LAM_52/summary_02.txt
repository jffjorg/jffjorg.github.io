Here is the English-text summary:

The Court's tentative ruling addresses the defendant Keck Medical Center of USC's demurrer to the plaintiff Jennifer L. Cosper's first amended complaint, which alleges medical malpractice and negligence. The Court finds that the plaintiff's complaint does not allege sufficient facts to constitute medical malpractice or negligence, as it fails to provide specific details about the treatment received and the alleged breach of duty. The Court also grants the defendant's motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages, as the complaint does not comply with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 425.13. The Court sustains the defendant's demurrer with 30 days' leave to amend, and grants the defendant's motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's first amended complaint.
