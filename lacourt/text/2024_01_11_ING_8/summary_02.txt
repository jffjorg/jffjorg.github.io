And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case, which concerns a motion to compel discovery responses from the defendants, South Coast Botanic Garden Foundation, Inc. and the County of Los Angeles. The plaintiffs, Susan Udewitz and David Udewitz, have requested that the court order the defendants to answer their discovery requests without objections and to deem the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission admitted.

The court has found that the defendants' responses to the discovery requests were inadequate and that they failed to provide objection-free responses. The court has also found that the defendants' counsel, Jaion Chung, was careless in handling the discovery requests and responses, and that she admitted to a series of mistakes.

The court has granted the motion to compel discovery responses and has ordered the defendants to provide verified further or supplemental responses to the discovery requests by January 31, 2024. The court has also granted the motion for sanctions against the defendants and has ordered them to pay $1,750 to the plaintiffs' counsel by January 31, 2024.

The court has also issued an advisory ruling, which states that it would be inclined to require the defendants to provide verified further or supplemental responses to the discovery requests by January 31, 2024, and that it would be inclined to require them to provide further or supplemental verified responses to the requests for admission with no objections, also by January 31, 2024.
