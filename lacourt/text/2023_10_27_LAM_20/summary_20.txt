And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendants' motion to tax Plaintiff's costs. The Plaintiff, DONE! Ventures, LLC, argues that the motion is untimely because it was filed two months after the deadline to serve a notice of motion to tax costs. The judge agrees and rules that the motion is waived and denied. Additionally, the judge strikes $2,176,484.61 in prejudgment interest from the memo of costs, as this is not an actual component of costs and was already rejected in a previous ruling. Counsel are encouraged to submit on the tentative ruling or appear by LACourtConnect, rather than in person, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
