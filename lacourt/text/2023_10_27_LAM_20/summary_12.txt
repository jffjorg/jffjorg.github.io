And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case where Plaintiff Hennig, Kramer, Ruiz & Singh, LLP is seeking to compel Defendant Wendy Seretan to undergo a deposition. The defendant argues that the parties had discussed holding off discovery while pursuing mediation, and that she has never refused to appear for a deposition. The plaintiff claims that they requested dates for a deposition but were ignored, and that there were many months of discussing dates with no resolution. Due to the lack of written records, the judge is relying on counsel's differing versions of what transpired. The judge rules that the equitable result is to compel a deposition within thirty days, but does not award sanctions. The judge encourages counsel to submit their responses to the tentative ruling through LACourtConnect, an online court platform, rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
