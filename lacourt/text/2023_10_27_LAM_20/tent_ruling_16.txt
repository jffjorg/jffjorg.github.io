 This is an employment action.  On April 17, 2023, Plaintiff Liliana A. filed a complaint against Defendant Pluto Acquisition Opco LL.C dba Universal Background Screening alleging causes of action regarding her employment with Defendant.  On May 25, 2023, Defendant filed a motion to compel arbitration.  On August 28, 2023, Defendant filed an amended motion.  Previously, the Court tentatively ruled as follows: “Although the FAA preempts Labor Code section 432.6 and there is no showing of unconscionability, the Court CONTINUES the hearing on this motion to determine whether the agreement is enforceable, specifically on whether there was an existence to arbitrate.”  As discussed previously, the Court again finds that the existence of an agreement to arbitrate has been shown by a preponderance of the evidence.  The additional briefing does not change the Court’s conclusion.  On the other hand, the provisions of the agreement omitting vacating/correcting an award under CCP § 1286.2(a)(4)-(5) are sticken, as is the provision relating to the time to bring a motion to vacate/correct.  (Civ. Code § 1670.5)  The Motion is granted.  The objections are overruled.  The Court expects to set an OSC re: dismissal without prejudice pursuant to a reservation of jurisdiction by the Court to proceed if and as necessary with any appropriate enforcement or other proceedings herein; with respect to the parties subject to the Arbitration Order in this case, all applicable statutes of limitation are tolled from the date of entry of this Order.  Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
