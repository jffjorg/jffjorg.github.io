 Plaintiff Hennig, Kramer, Ruiz & Singh, LLP seeks to compel the deposition of Defendant Wendy Seretan.  Defendant Seretan argues that the parties discussed holding off discovery while pursuing mediation; that she has never refused to appear for a deposition; and that Plaintiff’s counsel failed to meet and confer before bringing the instant Motion. Plaintiff argues that while discussing mediation it requested dates for a deposition but was ultimately ignored.  Plaintiff contends that there were many months of discussing dates for a deposition to no end.   There are no written records of what was discussed in relation to the discovery-mediation issue, only counsel each providing differing versions of what transpired.  The equitable result is to compel a deposition within thirty days, but not to award sanctions.Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
