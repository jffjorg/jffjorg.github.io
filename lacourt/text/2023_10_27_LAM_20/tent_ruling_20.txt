On February 7, 2023, a jury entered verdicts in favor of Plaintiffs DONE! Ventures, LLC (“Done!”) and Coastal Laundromat, Inc. (“Coastal”), and against Defendants Jerry Jamgotchian, El Segundo Plaza Associates L.P. (“ESPA”), and Theta Holding IV, Inc. (“Theta”), for Plaintiffs’ claims for interference with contract, negligent interference with prospective economic advantage, and breach of contract.On May 18, 2023, Done! filed a memorandum of costs in the amount of $2,391.826.07.Defendants now seek to tax Plaintiff’s costs.  Plaintiff argues that “Rule 3.1700 provided no discretion to consider a tardy motion to tax costs. Indeed, Defendants’ notice of motion to tax costs was due on or before June 3, 2023. This Court could have extended the time for Defendants to serve a notice of motion to tax costs only thirty (30) days, or July 3, 2023. Defendants did not file the parte application until September 6, 2023 – two months after this Court’s authority to extend Defendants’ deadline expired. Accordingly, the clerk ‘must’ immediately enter [Done!’s] costs on the judgment. Respectfully, this Court has no discretion to do otherwise. Accordingly, Defendants’ motion to tax costs is severely tardy and therefore cannot be considered on its merits for this reason alone.”Rule 3.1700(b)(1) states, “Any notice of motion to strike or to tax costs must be served and filed 15 days after service of the cost memorandum. If the cost memorandum was served by mail, the period is extended as provided in Code of Civil Procedure section 1013. If the cost memorandum was served electronically, the period is extended as provided in Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6(a)(4).”Here, the memorandum of costs was filed on May 18, 2023, and, while Defendants hotly dispute service, Plaintiff has attached an email showing that service occurred on the same day.  Therefore, the Motion is untimely to the extent it was filed in September 2023.  Thus, the Motion has been waived and is denied.On the other hand, the memo of costs includes a request for $2,176,484.61 in prejudgment interest, which is not an actual component of costs.  The grounds for prejudgment interest were already rejected in the Court’s September 5, 2023, ruling, and the Court will, again, not allow such interest to be awarded.  The interest is stricken from the memo of costs. Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
