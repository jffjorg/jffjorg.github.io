The court has issued a tentative ruling in this employment action, in which the defendant (Pluto Acquisition Opco LL.C dba Universal Background Screening) has moved to compel arbitration. The court has previously tentatively ruled that the agreement to arbitrate is enforceable, and has now made a final ruling to that effect. The court finds that the defendant has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the agreement exists. However, the court has also ruled that certain provisions of the agreement, including those relating to vacating and correcting an award, are unenforceable. The motion to compel arbitration is granted, and the objections are overruled. The court will set an order to show cause regarding dismissal without prejudice, and will toll the statute of limitations for the parties subject to the arbitration order.
