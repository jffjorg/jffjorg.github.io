T/R:      PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION IS GRANTED IN PART. 
 
PLAINTIFFS TO NOTICE.
 
If the parties
wish to submit on the tentative, please email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with notice to opposing
counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the day of the hearing.
 
The Court considers the moving papers, opposition, and reply.
 
Except as otherwise expressly provided
by statute, “a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover
costs in any action or proceeding.”  (CCP
§ 1032(b).)  “Allowable costs shall be
reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely
convenient or beneficial to its preparation.” 
(CCP § 1033.5(c)(2).)  “If the
items appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is on
the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or
necessary.”  (Ladas v. California
State Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal. App. 4th 761, 774.)  “On the other hand, if the items are properly
objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on the party
claiming them as costs.”  (Ibid.)
 
Plaintiffs move to tax certain
deposition costs, court reporter fees, messenger/delivery fees, and mediation
fees. Plaintiffs assert that $410.80 in deposition expedition fees, $225.00 in
deposition cancellation fees, and $631.40 in late
fees for payment of deposition costs are not reasonably necessary for
litigation. The Court agrees. The costs are stricken.
 
Plaintiffs asks the Court to strike $550 in court reporter fees for the
summary judgment hearing because Plaintiff already had obtained a court
reporter. Plaintiff also requests that the Court strike $605 in court reporter
fees for an unopposed ex parte. These costs are allowable under the statutes
and were necessary for litigation.
 
The Court will allow Defendants to recover costs of mediation and delivery
fees; they were necessary for the litigation.
 
Plaintiffs’ motion is GRANTED in part.
