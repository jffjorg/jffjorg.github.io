Motion
for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs
I.
Order Granting Attorneys’ Fees:
GRANTED, in part.
A.
Legal Standard 
A prevailing party is entitled to
recover costs as a matter of right. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subds. (a)(4),
(b).) Attorney’s fees are also recoverable as costs when authorized by
contract, statute, or law. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(10).) A
prevailing buyer in a Song-Beverly Act action is entitled to recover their
attorney’s fees and costs under the Act’s express terms. (Civ. Code, § 1794,
subd. (d); see Goglin v. BMW of North America, LLC (2016) 4 Cal.App.5th
462, 464, 471.)
The Court begins this inquiry “with
the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the
reasonable hourly rate.” (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084,
1095 (PLCM Group).) From there, the “lodestar figure may then be
adjusted [according to a multiplier enhancement] based on consideration of
factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value
for the legal services provided.” (Ibid.) Relevant multiplier factors
include “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the
skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the
litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, [and] (4) the
contingent nature of the fee award.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1132.)
For purposes of determining a
lodestar, absent a contrary showing, both the number of hours that the
prevailing party’s attorney spent litigating the case and his or her regular
hourly rate are presumed to be reasonable. (Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32
Cal.3d 621, 633-634, 639 (Serrano) [within context of Lab. Code, §
1021.5 private attorney general theory, absent a showing of “special
circumstances” that would render such an award unjust, litigant was entitled to
all hours actually spent, including those connected to fee-related matters, and
those necessary to establish and defend the fee claim]; Mandel v. Lackner
(1979) 92 Cal.App.3d 747, 761 [“The value of an attorney’s time generally is
reflected in his normal billing rate”], disapproved on other grounds in Serrano,
supra, 32 Cal.3d at p. 630, fn. 12 [relating to whether term “antecedent
litigation” was applicable between Mandel I and Mandel II].)
“In challenging attorney fees as
excessive because too many hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the
challenging party to point to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient
argument and citations to the evidence. General arguments that fees claimed are
excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice.” (Lunada Biomedical v.
Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 488, quoting Premier Med. Mgmt. Sys.,
Inc. v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.)
No specific findings reflecting the
court’s calculations for attorney’s fees are required; the record need only
show that the attorney’s fees were awarded according to the “lodestar” or
“touchstone” approach. (Rebney v. Wells Fargo Bank (1991) 232 Cal.App.3d
1344, 1349, disagreed with on other grounds in In re Marriage of Demblewski
(1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 232, 236, fn. 7 [disagreement as to statement of decision
requirements]; see Yu v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County (2020) 56
Cal.App.5th 636, fn. 6 [disapproving dictum In re Marriage of Demblewski
re: whether motions may be filed before a referee’s decision is entered].) 
Moreover,
the Court is considered “an expert in the matter of attorney fees” since “[t]he
value of attorney’s services is a matter with which a judge must necessarily be
familiar.” (Excelsior Union High Sch. Dist. of L.A. Cnty. v. Lautrup
(1969) 269 Cal.App.2d 434, 448 (Excelsior).) Accordingly, “[w]hen the
court is informed of the extent and nature of such services, its own experience
furnishes it with every element necessary to fix their value.” (Ibid.)
It follows
that the Court has broad discretion to determine the amount of a reasonable
attorney’s fee award, which will not be overturned absent a “manifest abuse of
discretion, a prejudicial error of law, or necessary findings not supported by
substantial evidence.” (Bernardi v. County of Monterey (2008) 167
Cal.App.4th 1379, 1393-1394.)
B.
Discussion
Here, Plaintiff seeks a court order
granting $27,804 in lodestar fees and $1,591.39 in costs related to this
action. (See Mot. Notice, p. ii; Mot., p. 10.)
1.
Reasonable Fees
The lodestar calculation begins
with a determination of the “reasonable hourly rate,” i.e., the rate
“prevailing in the community for similar work.” (PLCM Group, supra,
22 Cal.4th at p. 1095; see, e.g., Stratton v. Beck (2017) 9 Cal.App.5th
483, 496 [finding no abuse of discretion in court setting attorney’s hourly
rate based on comparison of rates from similarly experienced attorneys in same
field and area]; Children’s Hospital & Medical Center v. Bonta
(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 740, 783 (Children’s) [affirming award where “the
hourly rates allowed by the trial court are within the range of reasonable
rates charged by and judicially awarded comparable attorneys for comparable
work”], disapproved in Asanta v. California Dept. of Health Care Servs.
(9th Cir. 2018) 886 F.3d 795, 802, fn. 14 [disapproving Commerce Clause
interpretation in Children’s].)
The general rule is “[t]he relevant
‘community’ is that where the court is located. [Citations.]” (Altavion,
Inc. v. Konica Minolta Systems Laboratory, Inc. (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 26,
71; accord Marshall v. Webster (2020) 54 Cal.App.5th 275, 285.) This fee rate determination centers on the reasonable
market value of the services. (See, e.g., Serrano, supra, 32
Cal.3d at pp. 640-643 [discussing arguments and determining trial court did not
abuse discretion by applying fee rates for public interest counsel according to
reasonable market value, not the “normal billing rate” for public interest
attorneys suggested by defendants].) A judge may reasonably reduce an attorney’s
requested rate if the judge finds that the matter was not complex, that it did
not go to trial but was settled, that the attorney was a named partner who was
doing work that could have been done by a lower billing attorney in the firm,
or that the attorney did work that could have been done by a paralegal. (Morris
v. Hyundai Motor America (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 24, 41; 569 East County
Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc. (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th
426, 438-439 (569 East) [finding billing rate reduction of senior
attorney was justified where the attorney did “the yeoman’s work” that would
ordinarily be done by more junior associates with low billing rates].)

After review, the Court approves
the requested hourly rate for counsel here at $695 per hour for Michael
Saeedian (fifteen years’ experience), $525 per hour for Christopher Urner
(eight years, of which five are in the area of lemon law cases), and $250 per
hour for paralegal work.
These fee rate are supported by counsel’s
experience and skills (see Mot., Saeedian Decl., ¶¶ 2-4), as well as the
Court’s experience with fee rates in the Los Angeles area. (Excelsior, supra,
269 Cal.App.2d at p. 448.)
2.
Reasonable Hours
“Under the lodestar method, a party
who qualifies for a fee should recover for all hours reasonably spent unless
special circumstances would render an award unjust.” (Vo v. Las Virgenes
Mun. Water Dist. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 440, 446, citing Serrano, supra,
32 Cal.3d at pp. 632-633.) Time spent relating solely to the fee award is also
compensable. (Ketchum, supra, 24 Cal.4th at p. 1133.)
“‘Reasonably spent’ means that time
spent ‘in the form of inefficient or duplicative efforts is not subject to compensation.’”
(Horsford v. Board of Trustees of California State University (2005) 132
Cal.App.4th 359, 394 (Horsford), quoting Ketchum, supra,
24 Cal.4th at pp. 1132-1133.) In assessing the reasonableness of the hours
spent, “[t]he court can look to how many lawyers the other side utilized in
similar situations as an indication of the effort required.” (Donahue v.
Donahue (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 259, 272, citation omitted.)
Here, the Court determines that the
hours expended on this action were reasonable, with one exception for the time
billed for work litigating against Russell Westbrook for a negligent repair
claim for which fees are not recoverable. No reply brief was filed addressing
this issue. The Court will reduce the award by the amount of $5112.00 for the
time spent exclusively on that issue, plus an additional 25% of the remainder to
cut out time that was not spent on claims for which fees are recoverable. Thus,
$27,804 - $5112 = $22692 x 0.75 = $17,019.
While the opposition argues that
various additional time entries are excessive based on the copy-and-paste,
template nature of lemon law pleadings, discovery, and motions (Opp’n, pp.
5-7), the Court is satisfied that the hours requested here are reasonable for
the tasks involved in the billing records. The Court notes that verified
records are entitled to deference. (Horsford, supra, 132
Cal.App.4th at pp. 395-397.) Last, the Court notes that the time entries
reflect tasks for which a reasonable amount of time was expended, with most
entries involving tasks of 0.3 hours or less. (Mot., Saeedian Decl., Ex. A.)
3.
Fees Conclusion
Fees are GRANTED, in part, in the
amount of $17,019:
 
II.
Order Granting Costs: GRANTED.
A.
Legal Standard
In general, the “prevailing party”
is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs for suit in any action or
proceeding. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (b); Santisas v. Goodin
(1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 606; Scott Co. Of Calif. v. Blount, Inc. (1999)
20 Cal.4th 1103, 1108.) Assuming the “prevailing party” requirements are met,
the trial court has no discretion to order each party to bear his or her own
costs of suit. (Michell v. Olick (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1194, 1198; Nelson
v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 129.) The term “prevailing party”
for costs purposes is defined by statute to include:  
(1) The party with a net monetary
recovery;  
(2) A defendant who is dismissed
from the action;  
(3) A defendant where neither
plaintiff nor defendant recovers anything; and  
(4) A defendant as against those
plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against that defendant.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd.
(a)(4).)
A verified memorandum of costs is
prima facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and services therein listed were
necessarily incurred. (Rappenecker v. Sea-Land Serv., Inc. (1979) 93
Cal.App.3d 256, 266.) 
Any challenge to costs must be
filed and served within 15 days of service of the memorandum of costs plus
extra court or calendar days depending on the type of service. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1700, subd. (b)(1).) Failure to challenge costs within this
timeframe results in waiver of those rights. (Griffith v. Wellbanks &
Co. (1915) 26 Cal.App. 477, 480; cf. Sanabria v. Embrey (2001) 92
Cal.App.4th 422, 426 [citing case law derived from Griffith—first cited
in Sepulveda v. Apablasa (1938) 25 Cal.App.2d 381, 389, with Sepulveda
cited in Hydratec, Inc. v. Sun Valley 260 Orchard & Vineyard Co.
(1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 924, 929, and Hydratec cited in Sanabria—to
reverse trial court’s award of costs where costs memorandum was untimely filed].)
“A prematurely filed memorandum of
costs is ‘“a mere irregularity at best” that does not constitute reversible
error absent a showing of prejudice’ and is treated ‘as being timely filed.’” (Lowry
v. Port San Luis Harbor District (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 211, 221; accord Haley
v. Casa Del Rey Homeowners Assn. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 863, 880; Lange
v. Fisher (1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 113, 118].)
B.
Discussion
Here, no judgment has been entered
in this action, for which reason the 15- or 180-day deadline to file a
memorandum of costs has not been triggered. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1700(a)(1).)
Plaintiff Martinez has nevertheless
filed a costs memo, which the Court may consider as timely filed. (See Lowry,
supra, 56 Cal.App.4th at p. 221.)
No motion to strike or tax the
costs memorandum appears in the record.
Neither does FCA’s opposition
challenge costs. (See Opp’n, pp. 1-11.)
The clerk is thus entitled to enter
costs as a matter of procedure. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700(b)(1) &
(4).)
Costs are thus GRANTED in the
requested amount of $1,591.39.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff Andy Martinez’s Motion
for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs is GRANTED, in part, as follows:
(1) GRANTED, in part, as to fees in
the amount of $17,019; and
(2) GRANTED as to costs in the
amount of $1,591.39.
