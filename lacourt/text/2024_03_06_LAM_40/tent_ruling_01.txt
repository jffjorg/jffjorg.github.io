Background
Plaintiff William Davis sued
Defendants BMW of North America, LLC (BMW) and Does 1 through 50 pursuant to a
December 9, 2021 First Amended Complaint (FAC) alleging claims of (1) Breach of
Implied Warranty of Merchantability [Song-Beverly Act], (2) Breach of Express
Warranty [Song-Beverly Act], and (3) Failure to Comply with Civ. Code §
1793.2(b).
On January 24, 2022, the action was
noticed as removed to federal court.
On February 25, 2022, the Court
ordered dismissal of the action.
On March 28, 2022, the action was
noticed as remanded from federal court.
On April 5, 2022, the Court set
aside and vacated the February 25, 2022 dismissal.
On November 3, 2022, the Court held
a status conference regarding alternative dispute resolution ordering the
parties to make at least one good faith settlement attempt.
On December 11, 2023, the Court set
an order to show cause (OSC) hearing regarding dismissal by way of settlement
and advanced and vacated all previously scheduled hearings.
On December 18, 2023, Plaintiff
Davis executed a settlement agreement between the parties.
On December 26, 2024, BMW executed
the settlement agreement.
On February 7, 2024, Plaintiff
Davis filed a motion for attorneys’ fees and costs and expenses as the
stipulated prevailing party in this action by way of settlement. The copy of
the settlement agreement filed with the Court redacts the amount of monetary
compensation to be paid to Plaintiff Davis.
On February 22, 2024, BMW opposed
Plaintiff Davis’s motion.
On February 29, 2024, Plaintiff
Davis replied to BMW’s opposition.
Plaintiff Davis’s motion is now
before the Court.
 
Motion for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs
I.
Order Granting Attorneys’ Fees: GRANTED,
in part.
A.
Legal Standard 

A
prevailing party is entitled to recover costs as a matter of right. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1032, subds. (a)(4), (b).) Attorney’s fees are also recoverable as
costs when authorized by contract, statute, or law. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5,
subd. (a)(10).) A prevailing buyer in a Song-Beverly Act action is entitled to
recover their attorney’s fees and costs under the Act’s express terms. (Civ.
Code, § 1794, subd. (d); see Goglin v. BMW of North America, LLC (2016)
4 Cal.App.5th 462, 464, 471.)
The
Court begins this inquiry “with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours
reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” (PLCM Group
v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095 (PLCM Group).) From there,
the “lodestar figure may then be adjusted [according to a multiplier
enhancement] based on consideration of factors specific to the case, in order
to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services provided.” (Ibid.)
Relevant multiplier factors include “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the
questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent
to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys, [and] (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.” (Ketchum v.
Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.)
For
purposes of determining a lodestar, absent a contrary showing, both the number
of hours that the prevailing party’s attorney spent litigating the case and his
or her regular hourly rate are presumed to be reasonable. (Serrano v. Unruh
(1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 633-634, 639 (Serrano) [within context of Lab.
Code, § 1021.5 private attorney general theory, absent a showing of “special
circumstances” that would render such an award unjust, litigant was entitled to
all hours actually spent, including those connected to fee-related matters, and
those necessary to establish and defend the fee claim]; Mandel v. Lackner
(1979) 92 Cal.App.3d 747, 761 [“The value of an attorney’s time generally is
reflected in his normal billing rate”], disapproved on other grounds in Serrano,
supra, 32 Cal.3d at p. 630, fn. 12 [relating to whether term “antecedent
litigation” was applicable between Mandel I and Mandel II].)
“In
challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many hours of work are
claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point to the specific
items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to the evidence.
General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do
not suffice.” (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459,
488, quoting Premier Med. Mgmt. Sys., Inc. v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn
(2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.)
No
specific findings reflecting the court’s calculations for attorney’s fees are
required; the record need only show that the attorney’s fees were awarded
according to the “lodestar” or “touchstone” approach. (Rebney v. Wells Fargo
Bank (1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 1344, 1349, disagreed with on other grounds in In
re Marriage of Demblewski (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 232, 236, fn. 7
[disagreement as to statement of decision requirements]; see Yu v. Superior
Court of Los Angeles County (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 636, fn. 6 [disapproving
dictum In re Marriage of Demblewski re: whether motions may be filed
before a referee’s decision is entered].) 
Moreover, the Court is considered “an expert
in the matter of attorney fees” since “[t]he value of attorney’s services is a
matter with which a judge must necessarily be familiar.” (Excelsior Union
High Sch. Dist. of L.A. Cnty. v. Lautrup (1969) 269 Cal.App.2d 434, 448.)
Accordingly, “[w]hen the court is informed of the extent and nature of such
services, its own experience furnishes it with every element necessary to fix
their value.” (Ibid.)
It follows that the Court has broad
discretion to determine the amount of a reasonable attorney’s fee award, which
will not be overturned absent a “manifest abuse of discretion, a prejudicial
error of law, or necessary findings not supported by substantial evidence.” (Bernardi
v. County of Monterey (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1393-1394.)
B.
Discussion
Plaintiff
Davis seeks $74,611.46 in attorneys’ fees and costs, comprised of $56,376.25 in
lodestar fees, $5,009.96 in costs and expenses, a 1.2 multiplier enhancement
award of $11,275.25, and $1.950 in additional expenses related to this motion
for fees and costs. (Mot., Notice, p. ii.) Costs are discussed below in Section
II.
1.
Reasonable
Fees
The
lodestar calculation begins with a determination of the “reasonable hourly
rate,” i.e., the rate “prevailing in the community for similar work.” (PLCM
Group, supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 1095; see, e.g., Stratton v. Beck
(2017) 9 Cal.App.5th 483, 496 [finding no abuse of discretion in court setting
attorney’s hourly rate based on comparison of rates from similarly experienced
attorneys in same field and area].) The general rule is “[t]he relevant
‘community’ is that where the court is located. [Citations.]” (Altavion,
Inc. v. Konica Minolta Systems Laboratory, Inc. (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 26,
71; accord Marshall v. Webster (2020) 54 Cal.App.5th 275, 285.) The determination is instead framed around the reasonable
market value of the services. (See, e.g., Serrano, supra, 32
Cal.3d at pp. 640-643 [discussing arguments and determining trial court did not
abuse discretion by applying fee rates for public interest counsel according to
reasonable market value, not the “normal billing rate” for public interest
attorneys suggested by defendants].)

After
review, the Court determines that the billing rates for counsel of $650-$500
(depending on the year) for Nicholas Bravo and $500-600 for Adam Zolonz are
reasonable, based on the background, education, experience, reputation in the
community, and based on the Court’s own experience with billing rates in the
Los Angeles community.
 
2.
Reasonable
Hours
“Under
the lodestar method, a party who qualifies for a fee should recover for all
hours reasonably spent unless special circumstances would render an award
unjust.” (Vo v. Las Virgenes Mun. Water Dist. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 440,
446, citing Serrano, supra, 32 Cal.3d at pp. 632-633.) Time spent
relating solely to the fee award is also compensable. (Ketchum, supra,
24 Cal.4th at p. 1133.)
“‘Reasonably
spent’ means that time spent ‘in the form of inefficient or duplicative efforts
is not subject to compensation.’” (Horsford v. Board of Trustees of
California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 394 (Horsford),
quoting Ketchum, supra, 24 Cal.4th at pp. 1132-1133.) In
assessing the reasonableness of the hours spent, “[t]he court can look to how
many lawyers the other side utilized in similar situations as an indication of
the effort required.” (Donahue v. Donahue (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 259,
272, citation omitted.)
After
review, the Court determines that the increments of time expended by counsel on
the tasks identified in the moving papers’ billing records are facially reasonable.
The
Court makes this determination after an examination of these records. (Mot.,
Exs. B-C.) These records are entitled to credence. (Horsford, supra,
132 Cal.App.4th at pp. 395-397 [verified time records entitled to credence
absent clear indication they are erroneous]) and mostly show increments of time
under one hour, with tasks taking greater amounts of time being sporadic and
involving (1) discussions regarding depositions, vehicle inspections, or
preparing filings (e.g., for mediation) for Nicolas Bravo and (2) a single
entry for 3.9 hours by Adam Zolonz regarding document review. (Mot., Exs. B-C.)
While
the opposition characterizes this litigation as a simple one without sufficient
procedure to justify the hours claimed here (Opp’n, pp. 5-6)—76.95 for Nicolas
Bravo and 20.90 for Adam Zolonz (Mot., Exs. B-C.)—the Court finds that less than
100 hours of total work expended by counsel is facially reasonable in a
more than two-year litigation, billed by two attorneys, where the action was
removed to and remanded from federal court, and only settled on the eve of the previously
scheduled January 31, 2024, trial date. (Mot., Exs. A [settlement agreement
finalized Dec. 26, 2023], B-C [time records].)
Moreover,
the hours billed by Adam Zolonz between July and October 2021 reasonably
related to the pre-dispute demand, and his work in relation to the federal
court proceedings was also reasonable in time and in its connection to this
action. The other hours challenged by BMW simply involve litigation decisions
by Bravo and Zolonz—communications between counsel and review of deposition
transcript after settlement—that the Court finds are reasonable. (See Opp’n,
pp. 4-5 [challenging these entries].) The Court notes that approximately 16
items were billed as “no charge,” or “$0.00” to reduce de minimis or
duplicative charges.
The
Court does not see a basis to depart from deference to the amount of fees
requested and supported by the invoices.
3.
Multiplier
Enhancement Award
The
“lodestar figure may … be adjusted [according to a multiplier enhancement]
based on consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee
at the fair market value for the legal services provided.” (Ibid.)
Relevant multiplier factors include “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the
questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent
to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys, [and] (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.” (Ketchum, supra,
24 Cal.4th at p. 1132.)
The
court may also consider other factors, including the results obtained and
whether a party continues to litigate after a reasonable settlement offer. (Greene
v. Dillingham Constr. N.A. (2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 418, 426-427 (Greene)
[trial court has discretion to consider a variety of factors, including the
results obtained]; Meister v. Regents of Univ. of Cal. (1998) 67
Cal.App.4th 437, 452 (Meister) [trial court may consider that a party
continued to litigate after a reasonable, albeit informal, settlement offer],
disagreed with in Greene, supra, at p. 426 [disagreement as to
whether to consider informal settlement offer in reasonable hours determination].)
In
addition, when an attorney’s hourly rate is in the low range of the community
standard, the trial court may increase the lodestar. (See Donovan v. Poway
Unified School Dist. (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 567, 627-628 [finding the trial
court had discretion to add 0.25 lodestar multiplier when rate was “in the low
range of fair and reasonable”].)
After
review, the Court determines that a multiplier enhancement award is not
warranted.
First,
any contingency risk here is mitigated by the fact that fees are mandatory
pursuant to the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. (Ketchum, supra,
24 Cal.4th at pp. 1141-1142 [error for trial court to award multiplier
enhancement based on contingency nature of representation because risk of
contingency representation ended once fees became mandatory under statute].) Second,
it is error to use counsel’s qualifications both in arguing for a top billing
rate and for a multiplier. These points were raised in the opposition and not
addressed in the reply. (Compare Opp’n, p. 7, with Reply, p. 5; see Mot., pp.
10-12 [contingency arguments].) Third, the case was not so complex as to
justify a multiplier.
Finally,
the Court notes that the settlement agreement does not explain how much money
Plaintiff recovered and merely details that Plaintiff will retain the subject
vehicle and continue making payments under contract, with BMW agreeing to pay
an undisclosed amount of money to Plaintiff in return, upon receipt of which
Plaintiff would dismiss the case. (Mot., Ex. A, § 1.) This makes is impossible
to rely on the element of skill and results to award a multiplier because
although Plaintiff’s counsel did achieve a settlement, the favorability of that
settlement is unclear, particularly where there was no repurchase, as
originally demanded by Plaintiff on July 15, 2021. (Mot., Ex. D [initial
demand]; see Mot., p. 13 [arguments re: favorable results].)
4.
Fees
Conclusion
Fees
are GRANTED, in part, in the amount of $56,376.25 plus an additional three
hours for reviewing the opposition, preparing the reply, and appearing at oral
argument (or $1,950), for a total of $58,326.25.
II.
Order
Granting Costs: DENIED, without prejudice.
A.
Legal
Standard
In
general, the “prevailing party” is entitled as a matter of right to recover
costs for suit in any action or proceeding. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd.
(b); Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 606; Scott Co. Of
Calif. v. Blount, Inc. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1103, 1108.) Assuming the
“prevailing party” requirements are met, the trial court has no discretion to
order each party to bear his or her own costs of suit. (Michell v. Olick
(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1194, 1198; Nelson v. Anderson (1999) 72
Cal.App.4th 111, 129.) The term “prevailing party” for costs purposes is
defined by statute to include:  
(1)
The party with a net monetary recovery;  
(2)
A defendant who is dismissed from the action;  
(3)
A defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant recovers anything; and  
(4)
A defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against
that defendant.
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).)
If
the party does not fall within one of these four express categories, the court
may exercise its discretion to award or deny costs. (See Lincoln v. Schurgin
(1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 100, 105 (Lincoln).)
A
party that fails to apply for costs within the time prescribed by rule 3.1700
waives those costs because the deadline for applying for costs, though not
jurisdictional in the fundamental sense, is mandatory. (Hydratec, Inc. v.
Sun Valley 260 Orchard & Vineyard Co. (1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 924, 929.)
A
costs memorandum appears to be required where costs relate to items “allowable
as costs” listed in subdivision (a) of Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5.
(See Anthony v. City of Los Angeles (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 1011, 1016
[rule 3.1700 and 15-day constraint for costs memo did not apply to expert
witness fees where these costs are outside of allowable costs under section
1033.5 and the most sensible construction of rule 3.1700 is that it should
apply to those costs that the clerk can immediately enter as provided in Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1700(b)(4)].)
However,
the time to file a costs memorandum is not triggered until judgment is entered
(see Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700(a)(1)), and a costs memorandum filed
prior to this time is not premature and is instead considered timely filed. (Lowry
v. Port San Luis Harbor District (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 211, 221.)
B.
Discussion
The
Court finds that a determination on costs is not appropriate at this time.
The
opposition challenges costs on the sole ground that costs must be sought
pursuant to the requirements in California Rules of Court, rule 3.1700, which
this motion fails to do by failing to attach a memorandum of costs. (Opp’n, p.
1, fn. 1; cf. Reply, pp. 1-6 [failing to raise a rebuttal argument].)
A
review of Plaintiff’s motion’s costs shows that they relate to, among other
things, e-filing, advanced costs, and processing fees. (Mot., Exs. B-C
[attaching receipts and/or summarizing costs].)
These
costs may fall within allowable costs under section 1033.5. (See Code Civ.
Proc., § 1033.5, subds. (a)(1) [filing and motion fees], (a)(4) [service of
process].)
As
a result, it appears that a memorandum of costs should have been filed by
Plaintiff, regardless of whether costs are awardable based on the Song-Beverly
Consumer Warranty Act. (See Anthony, supra, 166 Cal.App.4th at p.
1016.)
However,
because judgment has not been entered in this action, the time period for
filing that memo has not been triggered. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1700(a)(1).)
The
Court adds that because the settlement agreement and papers before the Court
fail to clarify what net monetary was achieved by Plaintiff Davis, the costs
may not be properly supported as filed. (Mot., Ex. A, § 1 [redacting monetary
figure in settlement]; cf. Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4) [prevailing
party includes plaintiff that obtains net monetary recovery].)
Costs
are thus DENIED, without prejudice.
 

Conclusion
Plaintiff William Davis’s Motion
for Attorney’s Fees, Costs, and Expenses as the Stipulated Prevailing Party is
GRANTED in part and DENIED in part as follows:
(1) GRANTED, in part, as to
attorneys’ fees, in the amount of $58,326.25; and
(2) DENIED as to costs, without
prejudice.
