Roles:
  - Judge: ruling on motion for attorney's fees and costs
  - Plaintiff: seeking attorney's fees and costs
  - Defendant: opposing motion for attorney's fees and costs
Significant Statements:
  - "The Court determines that the billing rates for counsel of $650-$500 (depending on the year) for Nicholas Bravo and $500-600 for Adam Zolonz are reasonable, based on the background, education, experience, reputation in the community, and based on the Court's own experience with billing rates in the Los Angeles community."
  - "The Court does not see a basis to depart from deference to the amount of fees requested and supported by the invoices."
  - "The Court adds that because the settlement agreement and papers before the Court fail to clarify what net monetary was achieved by Plaintiff Davis, the costs may not be properly supported as filed."
