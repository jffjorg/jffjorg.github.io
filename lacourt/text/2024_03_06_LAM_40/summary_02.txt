And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a Judge regarding a motion for attorneys' fees and costs brought by Plaintiff Andy Martinez in a lawsuit against FCA US LLC, Russell Westbrook CDJR, and others. The motion was filed on January 4, 2024, and the Judge has considered the opposition filed by FCA on February 22, 2024. The Judge grants the motion in part, awarding fees in the amount of $17,019 and costs in the amount of $1,591.39. The Judge also reduces the fee award by $5,112.00 for time spent on a negligent repair claim that is not recoverable. The Judge's ruling is based on the prevailing party's right to recover costs and fees, as well as the "lodestar" method of calculating fees. The Judge finds that the hours expended by Plaintiff's counsel were reasonable, with one exception, and that the fee rate requested by counsel is supported by their experience and skills.
