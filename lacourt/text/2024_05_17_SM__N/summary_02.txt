And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendant's motion to set aside the default. The defendant, Gerald Fink, claims that he was served with process but relied on his co-defendant Irani Makimoto-Domino to handle the case. However, the judge finds that the defendant had notice of the action and chose not to participate, rather than being prevented from doing so by extrinsic factors. The judge cites several court cases to support the denial of the motion, including Olivera v. Grace, Kramer v. Traditional Escrow, Inc., and Cruz v. Fagor America, Inc. The judge concludes that the defendant's failure to participate in the case and his reliance on his co-defendant do not constitute a basis for setting aside the default.
