And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case. The plaintiff has failed to provide a basis for the amount of damages sought in the default package. Specifically, the plaintiff has not provided evidence to support the claimed amounts for pain, suffering, emotional distress, and loss of consortium. Additionally, the plaintiff has not claimed loss of consortium in the complaint. The judge believes that the issue of the property's condition should be handled by the homeowners' association and the City of Los Angeles, and that the plaintiff's attempts to resolve the issue with these entities are insufficient to warrant permanent injunctive relief. Furthermore, the judge is unclear about the basis for awarding interest in this case, citing Civil Code section 3288.
