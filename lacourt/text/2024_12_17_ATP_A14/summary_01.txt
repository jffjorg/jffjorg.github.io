Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to amend the fifth amended complaint to add a new cause of action for Violations of the California Public Records Act. The motion is denied because it would prevent the action from being brought to trial within the five-year deadline established under California Code of Civil Procedure section 583.310. The judge notes that the case has been pending for several years and that the parties have stipulated to allow the action to be brought to trial by January 31, 2025. The judge also notes that the proposed amendment would add a new claim that would be prejudicial to the defendants. The judge concludes that the motion to amend is denied.
