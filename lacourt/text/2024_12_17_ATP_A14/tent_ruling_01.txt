Legal Standard
 
Standard for Leave to Amend – “A party may amend its pleading once
without leave of the court at any time before the answer, demurrer, or motion
to strike is filed, or after a demurrer or motion to strike is filed but before
the demurrer or motion to strike is heard if the amended pleading is filed and
served no later than the date for filing an opposition to the demurrer or
motion to strike. A party may amend the pleading after the date for filing an
opposition to the demurrer or motion to strike, upon stipulation by the parties.
The time for responding to an amended pleading shall be computed from the date
of service of the amended pleading.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 472(a).)¿¿ 
¿ 
Trial courts may, in furtherance of justice
and on any proper terms, allow a party to amend any pleading. (Cal. Code Civ.
Proc., §473(a)(1); Branick v. Downey Savings & Loan Association
(2006) 39 Cal.4th 235, 242.) Trial courts may also, in their discretion and
after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may be just, an
amendment to any pleading or proceeding in other particulars; and may upon like
terms allow an answer to be made after the time limited by this code. (Cal.
Code Civ. Proc., §473(a); Branick, supra, 39 Cal.4th at 242.) Leave to
amend is generally liberally granted, provided there is no statute of
limitations concern. (Kolani v. Gluska (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 402, 411.)
Additionally, “judicial policy favors resolution of all disputed matters in the
same lawsuit.” (Kittredge Sports Co. v. Superior Court (1989) 213 Cal.
App. 3d 1045, 1047.) Trial courts may deny the plaintiff’s leave to amend if
there is prejudice to the opposing party, such as delay in trial, loss of
critical evidence, or added costs of preparation. (Branic, supra, at
242.)¿¿ 
¿ 
Under California Rules of Court Rule 3.1324,
a motion to amend a pleading before trial must (1) include a copy of the
proposed amendment or amended pleading, which must be serially numbered to
differentiate it from previous pleadings or amendments; (2) state what
allegations in the previous pleading are proposed to be deleted, if any, and
where, by page, paragraph and line number, the deleted allegations are located;
and (3) state what allegations are proposed to be added to the previous
pleading, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the
additional allegations are located. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324(a).) A
separate supporting declaration specifying (1) the effect of the amendment; (2)
why the amendment is necessary and proper; (3) when the facts giving rise to
the amended allegations were discovered; and (4) the reason why the request for
amendment was not made earlier must accompany the motion. (Id., Rule
3.1324(b).)¿¿

Discussion
 
Application – Plaintiffs
argue that the prevalent discovery issues that have plagued this case have
provided the basis for a new cause of action: Violations of the California
Public Records Act under the California Constitution, Article 1, Section 3; and
Cal. Gov. Code §§ 7920.00 et. seq., 7921.000 et. seq., and 7922.525.
Plaintiffs seek to amend the 5AC to include this new cause of action.
 
Defendants argue that granting
this motion would make it impossible for Plaintiffs to bring their case to
trial prior to the expiration of the five-year deadline established under Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. § 583.310, Plaintiffs are attempting to bypass the Court’s
order on the Motion for Summary Judgment, Plaintiff’s motion is untimely as the
facts that establish the basis for this motion were known to Plaintiffs no
later than March 25, 2024. Defendants then argue the merits of the motion,
presenting that Plaintiffs did not obtain summary adjudication on the Public
Records Act (“PRA”) claim and cannot definitively prove that Defendants lied or
violated the California Public Records Act, and Plaintiffs have no remedy under
the proposed cause of action. 
 
In Reply, Plaintiffs present that
they are not attempting to revive a prior PRA claim, but add a new claim due to
Defendants’ actions, that their motion is timely and that they have no need to
address the delay in filing this motion, and that the PRA claim has a higher
standard than the California Discovery act as it asserts a violation of
Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights. Plaintiffs further argue that a PRA claim
will allow them to ask for costs, and legal fees should they elect to have an
attorney at the time of trial if they are prevailing parties. 
 
The most significant issue facing
this Court on this motion is the five-year deadline under Cal. Code Civ. Proc.
§ 583.310. Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 583.310 provides: 
 
An action shall be
brought to trial within five years after the action is commenced against the
defendant.
 
Here, the action was brought
against Defendants on November 19, 2018. Five years from the date of
commencement of the action was November 19, 2023. The parties stipulated to
allow the action to be brought to trial by January 31, 2025. To allow the
Motion to Amend would prevent the action from being litigated (i.e., trial delay).

 
Further, the 5AC has been the
operative pleading as of October 14, 2021. All stages of pre-litigation have
been conducted and the case is now ready for trial. To allow the Motion to
Amend to include a last-minute claim would severely prejudice Defendants. 
 
Accordingly, the Court DENIES the
Motion to Amend.
 
-----
 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiffs Marci Higer and Brad Waisbren’s Motion for
Leave to Amend Fifth Amended Complaint is DENIED.
