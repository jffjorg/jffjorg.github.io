Legal Standard
 
Standard for Reconsideration – Cal. Civ. Code Proc. § 1008(a) states:¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
When an
application for an order has been made to a judge, or to a court, and refused
in whole or in part, or granted, or granted conditionally, or on terms, any
party affected by the order may, within 10 days after service upon the party of
written notice of entry of the order and based upon new or different facts,
circumstances, or law, make application to the same judge or court that made
the order, to reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior
order.¿ The party making the application shall state by affidavit what
application was made before, when and to what judge, what order or decisions
were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed
to be shown.¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿ 
A court acts in excess of
jurisdiction when it grants a motion to reconsider that is not based upon “new
or different facts, circumstances or law.” (Gilberd v. AC Transit (1995)
32 Cal.App.4th 1494, 1499.)¿Motions for reconsideration are restricted to
circumstances where a party offers the Court some fact or circumstance not
previously considered, and some valid reason for not offering it earlier.¿ (Id.)¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
Moreover, there is a strict
requirement of diligence, which means the moving party must present a
satisfactory explanation for failing to provide the evidence or different facts
earlier.¿ (Garcia v. Hejmadi (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 674, 690.)¿ The
burden under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 1008 is comparable to that of a party
seeking a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence: the information
must be such that the moving party could not, with reasonable diligence, have
discovered or produced it at trial.¿ (New York Times Co. v. Superior Court
(2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 206, 212-213; Mink v. Superior Court (1992) 2
Cal.App.4th 1338 [“ ‘[T]he party seeking reconsideration must provide not only
new evidence but also a satisfactory explanation for the failure to produce
that evidence at an earlier time.’ ”]; Glade v. Glade (1995) 38
Cal.App.4th 1441 [“The party seeking reconsideration must provide not just new
evidence or different facts, but a satisfactory explanation for the failure to
produce it at an earlier time.”].)¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
New circumstances can be shown
by evidence that the court failed to consider a timely-filed memorandum of
points and authorities in its prior ruling.¿ (Johnston v. Corrigan
(2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 553, 556.)¿¿¿¿¿

Discussion
 
Application – First,
there appears to be an issue of timeliness. Cal. Civ. Code Proc. § 1008 provides a 10-day
timeline for a motion for consideration. (See Cal. Civ. Code Proc. § 1008(a) [“When
an application for an order has been made to a judge, or to a court, and
refused in whole or in part, or granted, or granted conditionally, or on terms,
any party affected by the order may, within 10 days after service upon the
party of written notice of entry of the order and based upon. . .”].) The
certificate of mailing for the Court’s Hearing on the Motion to Quash, i.e.,
written notice of entry of the order, is dated October 17, 2024. Ten days from October
17, 2024 is Sunday, October 27, 2023. “Unless otherwise provided by law, if the
last day for the performance of any act that is required by these rules to be
performed within a specific period of time falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or
other legal holiday, the period is extended to and includes the next day that
is not a holiday.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 1.10(b). As such, Defendants were
to file this motion by October 28, 2024, Defendants, however, did not file a
Motion for Reconsideration by this date. Instead, they filed an appeal. During
the appeal, Defendants filed this motion on November 04, 2024. However, this
issue is resolved by the holding in Bd. of Medical Quality Assurance v. Superior
Court (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 361, 701 fn. 4 which reads: “The time
limitation of Code of Civil Procedure section 1008 is not jurisdictional. Trial
courts have inherent authority to reconsider interim rulings until final
judgment. (Blue Mountain Development Co. v. Carville (1982) 132
Cal.App.3d 1005, 1013 [183 Cal.Rptr. 594].)”
 
The Court next turns to the
motion itself. 
 
Defendants do not provide new
facts. Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration reiterates the January 06, 2024
date, and repeats in exact wording the following: 
 
The Defendants first
learned that this case existed when the new tenant in the mobile unit
discovered documents which had been left there and immediately gave them to the
Defendants on June 6, 2024. 
 
Immediately
following receipt of the documents on June 6, 2024, the Defendants engaged
counsel who initially moved to set aside the entry of default which was denied.

 
Following the
denial, counsel began to delve deeply into this case and discovered that
Defendants had been served initially in this case and continually in this case
since its beginning at the address of the rented mobile unit where the
Plaintiffs had formerly resided. No attempt had ever been made to serve the
Defendants at the address where they have actually resided for the last 15
years. That address was known to the Plaintiff when the case commenced. 
 
Section 415.20 of
the Califormia Code of Civil Procedure [CCP] allows substitute service ona
defendant followed up by mailing the summons and complaint to the defendants
after it is left at the address where it was served. However, at least some due
diligence is required to attempt to discover the address where the summons and
complaint should be served and in this case, clearly that was not done. 
 
Section 418.10 CCP
allows a defendant to move to quash service of summons and complaint when
service has been improperly made. 
 
There is clearly no
better case to grant a motion to quash when a plaintiff serves a defendant
where the plaintiff resides. This is most egregious when the plaintiff could
have easily discovered the true address of the Defendants.
 
However, if this
motion be granted, the Defendants need not be served properly again but any
documents may be served on Defendants’ counsel. Defendants will then will
respond to the Complaint filed and defend the case.
 
(Compare Motion for
Reconsideration 5:22-6:20 with Motion to Quash 7:7-8:3.) 
 
Thus, under the legal standard, ante,
there is no basis for the Court to grant reconsideration. 
 
The Court reiterates that a Motion
to Quash Service of Summons itself is a responsive pleading under Cal. Code
Civ. Proc. § 418.10 and Defendants are in default. Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
418.10(d) contemplates a motion “under Section 473 or 473.5 when joined with a
motion under this section.” 
 
Accordingly, the Motion for
Reconsideration is DENIED.
 
-----
 
Conclusion
 
Defendants Lorenzo Pasqual and Catarina Pasqual’s
Motion for Reconsideration is DENIED.
