ANALYSIS:
 
On June 22, 2023, Plaintiff Tri-Tech Restoration and
Construction, Co. (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action for breach of contract
and common counts against Defendant Wenxuan Fan (“Defendant”). Following
Defendant’s failure to file a responsive pleading, the Court entered their
default on October 11, 2023. Default Judgment was entered on November 28, 2023.
 
Defendant filed the instant Motion to Vacate Default and
Default Judgment on March 18, 2024. Plaintiff filed an opposition on March 27,
2024 and Defendant replied on April 2, 2024.
 
Discussion
 
The Court acknowledges that the Motion was not timely served
at least 16 court days prior to the hearing date, plus two court days for
service by electronic mail. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1005 and 1010.6, subd.
(a)(4)(B).) However, Plaintiff prepared a substantive opposition without
indicating any prejudice from the shortened notice period. (Opp., Bates Decl.)
 
 
The Motion is brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 473, subdivision (b), which states that an application for relief must
be made within a reasonable time, no more than six months after entry of the
order from which relief is sought and must be accompanied by an affidavit of
fault attesting to the mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect of the moving
party or its attorney. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); English v. IKON
Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130, 143.) The motion must also be
accompanied by a copy of the moving defendant’s proposed pleading. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) This can be corrected if Defendant submits a proposed
responsive pleading by the hearing date. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); Carmel,
Ltd. v. Tavoussi (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 393, 403.)
 
The instant Motion was filed less than six months after
entry of default and within a reasonable time. Defendant declares that upon
learning of the entry of default in October 2023, they actively sought legal
representation. (Motion, Fan Decl., ¶¶9-17.) Despite reaching out to numerous
attorneys and legal organizations, it took months for Defendant to find an
attorney willing to take their case. (Ibid.) Defendant hired defense
counsel on March 8, 2023 and promptly filed this Motion. (Id. at ¶17.)
The declaration also demonstrates that Defendant’s failure to respond was due
to excusable neglect in that they misunderstood the trial date of December 2024
as the date by which a response to the lawsuit was required. (Id. at
¶6.) Finally, the Motion is accompanied by a copy of Defendant’s proposed
answer, as required, as well as a proposed cross-complaint. (Id. at Exh.
A.) 
 
The Court does not find Defendant’s declaration lacks
credibility, as Plaintiff urges in opposition. There is nothing to indicate
that Defendant’s higher education would mean he understands legal proceedings
or would not mistake the trial date as the deadline to respond. Nor does
Plaintiff offer any legal authority for its contention that Defendant’s mistake
constitutes “gross negligence.”   
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds Defendant is
entitled to relief from the entry of default and default judgment pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Wenxuan Fan’s Motion to Vacate Default and Default
Judgment is GRANTED. WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER, DEFENDANT IS TO FILE AND
SERVE THE PROPOSED RESPONSE TO THE COMPLAINT.
