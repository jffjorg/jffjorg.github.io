ANALYSIS: 
 

On May 25, 2022, Plaintiff Michael
M. Mojaver (“Plaintiff”), in propria persona, filed the Complaint in this
action against Defendant Michael J. Bayard (“Defendant”). Proof of service by
mail was filed on February 28, 2023 and April 10, 2023. The case came for trial
on November 22, 2023, at which time the Court placed the trial off calendar and
set an order to show cause regarding Plaintiff’s failure to enter Defendant’s
default and default judgment. (Minute Order, 11/22/23.) 
 
The Motion to Quash was filed by
Defendant on February 1, 2024 and was initially set for hearing in Department
25 in the Spring Street Courthouse. On February 29, 2024, the case was
transferred to Department 26 in the Spring Street Courthouse. No opposition has
been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
Defendant moves to quash service
of the Summons and Complaint on the grounds that Plaintiff did not serve
them in the statutorily required manner. The Motion is brought pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 418.10, which states: “A
defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time to plead or within any
further time that the court may for good cause allow, may serve and file a
notice of motion for one or more of the following purposes: To quash service of
summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or
her.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10, subd.
(a)(1), emphasis added.) 
 
Where service is challenged, the
burden is on the plaintiff to prove the facts requisite to an effective
service. “When a defendant challenges the court’s personal jurisdiction on the
ground of improper service of process ‘the burden is on the plaintiff to prove
the existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the facts requisite to an
effective service.’” (Summers v. McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403,
413; see also Lebel v. Mai (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 1154, 1160.) However,
a proof of service containing a declaration from a registered process server
invokes a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence of
the facts stated in the return. (Cal. Evid. Code, § 647; see American
Express Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 383, 390.)
 
Neither proof of service by
mailing is attested to by a registered process server. (Proofs of Service,
filed 02/28/23 and 04/10/23, ¶7.) “Service of a summons [by mail] is deemed
complete on the date a written acknowledgment of receipt of summons is executed,
if such acknowledgment thereafter is returned to the sender.” (Code Civ. Pro.,
§ 415.30, subd. (c).) Defendant has properly challenged service of the Summons
and Complaint by filing this action and attesting in their own declaration that
they did not sign the acknowledgment of receipt. (Motion, Bayard Decl., ¶¶1-6.)
The signature on the proof of service filed on February 28, 2023 is by “R.
Bayard”; the proof of service filed on April 10, 2023 is signed by “Micheal
Boyard.” Neither is the correct spelling of Defendant’s name and neither
matches Defendant’s signature on their declaration. (Motion, Bayard Decl., p.
2.) The burden now shifts to Plaintiff to demonstrate that Defendant was the
individual who signed the acknowledgments of receipt dated February 23, 2023
and March 2, 2023. As Plaintiff has not filed an opposition to the instant
Motion, however, they have not carried their burden of proof. 
 
The Court also finds that the Motion
is timely because it demonstrates Defendant was never served with the Summons
and Complaint as required by statute. Therefore, the last day for Defendant to
file a response to the action has not yet passed. 
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, Specially Appearing Defendant Michael J.
Bayard’s Motion to Quash Service of the Summons and Complaint is GRANTED. ORDER
TO SHOW CAUSE REGARDING FAILURE TO FILE PROOF OF SERVICE OF SUMMONS IS SET FOR
APRIL 30, 2024 AT 9:30 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE.
