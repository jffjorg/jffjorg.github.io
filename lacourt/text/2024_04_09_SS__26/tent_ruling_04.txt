Huntington5207, LLC v. Chen, et al.MOTION
TO DEEM REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION ADMITTED; 
REQUEST
FOR SANCTIONS(CCP § 2033.280)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
            
Plaintiff Huntington5207, LLC’s
Motion to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted and Request for Sanctions is
GRANTED. DEFENDANT HUI YING CHEN IS ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $510.00 TO
PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
    
ANALYSIS:
 
On January 19, 2024, Plaintiff Huntington5207, LLC (“Plaintiff”)
served Requests for Admissions on Defendant Hui Ying Chen (“Defendant”). (Motion, Sun Decl., Exh. A.) Despite a meet and
confer effort, to date, Defendant has not served verified responses to the
Requests for Admission. (Id. at ¶¶4-7 and Exh. B.) Plaintiff filed the
instant Motion to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted (“the Motion”) on March
11, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to deem requests for admission can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280.) Further, the motion can be brought at any time after the
responding party fails to provide the responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.)
Due to Defendant’s failure to timely serve verified responses and resultant
waiver of objections, Plaintiff is entitled to an order deeming the Requests
for Admission admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.) 
 
The Court is required to award sanctions under the moving
statute. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) While properly noticed, the
sanctions sought are excessive. Under a lodestar calculation, sanctions are
granted against Defendant in the amount of $510.00 based on one hour of
attorney time billed at $450.00 per hour, plus the $60.00 filing fee. (Motion,
Sun Decl., ¶9.)
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Huntington5207, LLC’s Motion to Deem Requests for
Admission Admitted and Request for Sanctions is GRANTED. DEFENDANT HUI YING
CHEN IS ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $510.00 TO PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL WITHIN 20
DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
