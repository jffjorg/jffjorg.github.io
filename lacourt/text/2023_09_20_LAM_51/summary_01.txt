And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for summary judgment filed by the defendant, Bede USA, Inc. The defendant had argued that the plaintiff, RM Glass, Inc., failed to establish a valid breach of contract because it did not obtain proper written documentation and was not a duly licensed contractor during the performance of the contract. The judge found that the defendant had failed to establish that no triable issue of fact exists as to whether the plaintiff had obtained proper documentation and that the substantial compliance exception may apply to the plaintiff's licensing status. Therefore, the motion for summary judgment is denied. The case will proceed to trial.
