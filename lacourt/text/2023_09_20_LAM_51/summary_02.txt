And here is the English-text summary:

The court has considered the supplement brief filed by the defendant on August 18, 2023, which acknowledges that they are making arguments rather than stating facts in their moving papers and separate statement. The court appreciates this concession. The defendant's reliance on the case of Pacific Caisson & Shoring, Inc. v. Bernards Bros. Inc. (2015) is misplaced, as the plaintiff in that case simply ignored the statute because they believed it did not apply, whereas there is no evidence that the plaintiff in this case ignored the law or believed it did not apply. In fact, the evidence presented by the plaintiff shows that the California State Licensing Board requires contractors to maintain workers' compensation policies. The court will clarify the law and resolve the dispute over the application of the law and the evidence presented by the plaintiff.

## English Summary

The judge has reviewed the arguments presented by both parties in this case.  The Defendant's main argument relies on a previous case where the Plaintiff allegedly ignored a relevant statute. However, the judge finds this argument inapplicable to the current case, stating that there is no evidence the Plaintiff here ignored the law or believed it didn't apply to them.

The judge also notes that the Plaintiff presented evidence showing that the CSLB requires contractors to maintain workers' compensation policies. This evidence suggests the Plaintiff is in compliance with the relevant legal requirements. 


The judge's tentative ruling indicates a potential leaning towards the Plaintiff's position but a final decision will be made at the upcoming court hearing.

The court has reviewed the supplemental brief filed by the defendant on August 18, 2023, which acknowledges that the defendant's moving papers and separate statement contain arguments rather than facts. The court appreciates this concession. The court also finds that the defendant's reliance on a 2015 case, Pacific Caisson & Shoring, Inc. v. Bernards Bros. Inc., is misplaced. In that case, the plaintiff simply ignored a statute because they believed it did not apply, whereas in this case, there is no evidence that the plaintiff ignored the law or believed it did not apply. Instead, the evidence presented by the plaintiff shows that the California State Licensing Board requires contractors to maintain workers' compensation policies, which the plaintiff has complied with.

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has considered the supplement brief filed by the Defendant on August 18, 2023, in which they acknowledge that they are making arguments in their moving papers, rather than stating facts. The Court appreciates this concession. However, the Judge has found that the Defendant's reliance on a previous court case, Pacific Caisson & Shoring, Inc. v. Bernards Bros. Inc., is misplaced. In that case, the Plaintiff had ignored the relevant statute, which is not the case here. The evidence presented by the Plaintiff shows that the California State License Board (CSLB) requires contractors to maintain workers' compensation policies, and there is no evidence that the Plaintiff ignored this law or believed it did not apply to them. The Judge's tentative ruling suggests that the Defendant's arguments are not supported by the facts or the law.

English text:
The court has reviewed and taken into account the supplemental brief filed by the Defendant on August 18, 2023, which acknowledges that the Defendant is presenting arguments in their moving papers and separate statement, rather than stating facts. The court appreciates this concession.

The Defendant's reliance on the case Pacific Caisson & Shoring, Inc. v. Bernards Bros. Inc. (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 1246 is inappropriate. In that case, the Plaintiff disregarded the statute because they mistakenly believed it did not apply to them. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the Plaintiff in this case ignored the law or believed it did not apply to them. It is clear that the evidence presented by the Plaintiff demonstrates that the CSLB requires contractors to maintain workers’ compensation policies.
