And here is the English-text summary:

The court has considered the supplement brief filed by the defendant on August 18, 2023, which acknowledges that they are making arguments rather than stating facts in their moving papers and separate statement. The court appreciates this concession. The defendant's reliance on the case of Pacific Caisson & Shoring, Inc. v. Bernards Bros. Inc. (2015) is misplaced, as the plaintiff in that case simply ignored the statute because they believed it did not apply, whereas there is no evidence that the plaintiff in this case ignored the law or believed it did not apply. In fact, the evidence presented by the plaintiff shows that the California State Licensing Board requires contractors to maintain workers' compensation policies. The court will clarify the law and resolve the dispute over the application of the law and the evidence presented by the plaintiff.
