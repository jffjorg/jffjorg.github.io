[1]The
court read and considered the supplement brief by Defendant filed 8/18/23 that acknowledges
that they are making “arguments” in their moving papers and separate statement
and not stating facts. The Court appreciates the concession.


[2]Defendant’s
reliance on Pacific Caisson &
Shoring, Inc. v. Bernards Bros. Inc. (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 1246 is
misplaced. There, Plaintiff simply ignored the statute because they believed,
incorrectly, that it did not apply. There is no evidence that Plaintiff here
ignored the law or believed that it did not apply to them. To be clear, the
evidence presented by Plaintiff  the
evidence shows that the CSLB requires contractors to maintain workers’compensation
policies
