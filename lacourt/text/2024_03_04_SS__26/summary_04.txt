And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Rudy Sanchez Morales' motion to vacate the default and default judgment entered against him. The motion was filed eight months after the entry of default and five months after the entry of default judgment, which is not considered a reasonable time under the Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b). Additionally, the six-month deadline is jurisdictional and not subject to tolling, making the motion untimely. The defendant has failed to provide any analysis or additional authority regarding the statute, and the motion does not address why the filing of the motion should be considered reasonable. Therefore, the motion is denied.
