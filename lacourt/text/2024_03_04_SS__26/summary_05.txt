And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Motion to Vacate Default and Default Judgment filed by defendants Neoglory Jewelry, Yue Lu, and Li Wu. The motion was based on Code of Civil Procedure sections 473, subdivision (b), 473.5, and 473(d). The Judge found that the motion was timely filed, but did not demonstrate that the defendants' failure to file a responsive pleading was due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Additionally, the Judge found that the service of the Summons and Complaint on the defendants was in accordance with the statutory requirements, and therefore the default and default judgment were valid. The Judge denied the motion, and the case will proceed as previously scheduled.
