ANALYSIS: 
 
Plaintiff Robert Ames (“Plaintiff”)
filed the instant action for conversion, breach of contract, promissory fraud,
and discrimination.
against Defendant Luis Rosas (“Defendant”)
on April 4, 2022. Defendant filed an answer on July 10, 2023. Trial is set for
hearing on April 3, 2024.
 
Defendant filed the
instant Motion to Continue Trial on February 26, 2024. No opposition has been
filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
“Although continuances of
trials are disfavored, each request for a continuance must be considered on its
own merits. The Court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of
good cause requiring the continuance.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332, subd.
(c).) The Court may look to the following factors in determining whether a
trial continuance is warranted: (1) proximity of the trial date; (2) whether
there was any previous continuance of trial due to any party; (3) the length of
the continuance requested; (4) the availability of alternative means to address
the problem that gave rise to the motion; (5) the prejudice that parties or
witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance; and (6) whether trial
counsel is engaged in another trial. 
(See generally, Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332, subd. (d)(1)-(11).)
Additionally, factors for the Court to consider include: a party’s excused
inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence
despite diligent efforts; whether all parties have stipulated to a continuance;
and any other fact or circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the
motion or application. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332, subds. (c), (d).)
 
Defendant argues that good
cause exists for a continuance of the trial date, which is currently set for April
3, 2024, because he has been out of the country for the last few months for a
family medical emergency. (Motion, Rosas Decl., ¶3.) Defendant will also be out
of the country on the current trial date. (Id. at ¶6.) Plaintiff has
stipulated to a continuance of approximately six months. (Id. at Exh.
1.) These circumstances are reasonable grounds to continue the trial date.
There have no been any prior continuances. Based on the foregoing, the Court
finds that the factors of Rule 3.1332 weigh in favor of the requested
continuance of the trial date.

Defendant Luis
Rosas’ Motion to Continue the Trial Date is GRANTED. TRIAL IS CONTINUED TO NOVEMBER
5, 2024 AT 8:30 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE. DISCOVERY
