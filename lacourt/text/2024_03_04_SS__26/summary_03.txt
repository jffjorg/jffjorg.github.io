And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Geneveive Germain's Motion to Reclassify, which was filed on January 23, 2024. The motion was brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 403.040, which allows a plaintiff to file a motion for reclassification of an action within the time allowed for that party to amend the initial pleading. The judge has denied the motion, finding that Plaintiff has not shown good cause for the timing of the request and that the case is not incorrectly classified.

The judge notes that Plaintiff's counsel failed to realize that the action was in the limited jurisdiction court, even if excusable, and that Plaintiff has not provided any evidence of damages in this action to demonstrate a possibility that they will exceed $35,000.00, the jurisdictional limit. The judge also finds that the evidence of damages presented by Plaintiff in its reply is improper, as it deprives Defendant of proper notice of the basis of the motion.

The judge concludes that the Plaintiff's Motion to Reclassify is denied.
