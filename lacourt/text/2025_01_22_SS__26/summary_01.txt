And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion for attorney's fees filed by William B. Serns and Eydie Serns. The motion was brought under Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 870.2, Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 1021.5, and 42 USC section 12205. The Serns Defendants argued that they are entitled to attorney's fees as the prevailing defendants in a state law action brought under the Unruh Civil Rights Act (UCRA). However, the Court found that the Serns Defendants failed to provide valid authority for the proposition that the fee shifting provision under section 12205 of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) applies to a state law action brought under the UCRA. The Court also noted that the Serns Defendants cited an unpublished appellate court case, which is not citable under California law. The Court concluded that the Serns Defendants have not shown any legal basis for an award of attorney's fees and therefore denied the motion.
