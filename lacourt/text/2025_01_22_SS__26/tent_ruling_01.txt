  Case Number:  21TRCV00820    Hearing Date:   January 22, 2025    Dept:  26 Shayler v. Prairie Hospitality Group, Inc. et al.,TENTATIVE RULING:
Defendants William B. Serns and
Eydie Serns’ Motion for Attorney’s Fees is DENIED.  
ANALYSIS:On November 5, 2021, Plaintiff
James Shayler (“Plaintiff”) filed the Complaint in this action against Defendants
Prairie Hospitality Group Inc. (“Defendant PHG”),
William B. Serns and Eydie Serns (“the Serns Defendants”). The action was
assigned to an unlimited civil courtroom, Department 8 in the Torrance
Courthouse. Default was entered against the Serns Defendants on April 25, 2022.
Plaintiff stipulated to vacate the
entry of default with the Serns Defendants on August 2, 2022, who filed their
answer on October 3, 2022. The case was then reclassified to the limited
jurisdiction court by stipulation on May 3, 2024. (Stip and Order, 05/03/24.)
On October 23, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed the Serns Defendants from the action,
who filed a memorandum of costs on the same date.
The Serns Defendants filed the
instant Motion for Attorney’s Fees on November 20, 2024. Plaintiff filed an
opposition on January 8, 2025 and the Serns Defendants replied on January 15,
2025.
Discussion
The Motion is brought pursuant to Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
870.2, Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 1021.5, and 42 USC section 12205. (Notice of Motion, p. 2:9-11.) The first two
statutes, however, are not cited in the memorandum of points and authorities. The
Serns Defendants rely on 42 USC section 12205 for the argument that this
federal statute that allows a prevailing defendant to obtain attorney’s fees in
a state law case brought under the Unruh Civil Rights Act (“the UCRA”).
This action alleges
a single cause of action for violation of the UCRA, as set forth at section 51
of the Civil Code. (Compl., ¶¶34-37.) The UCRA makes violations of the
Americans with Disabilities Act (“the ADA”) a violation of California law.
(Civ. Code, § 51, subd. (f).) However, the Serns Defendants cite no valid
authority for the proposition that the fee shifting provision under section
12205 of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“the ADA”) applies to a state law
action brought under the UCRA. Instead, the Motion cites only an unpublished
appellate court case, and even fails to provide a page citation. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 8.1115(a) [“Except as provided in (b), an opinion of a California
Court of Appeal or superior court appellate division that is not certified for
publication or ordered published must not be cited or relied on by a court or a
party in any other action.”].) Despite the non-citable nature of the case being
pointed out in Plaintiff’s opposition, Defendant doubles-down on its improper
citation by relying on the same case in reply.
The reply also fails
to address the case law cited by Plaintiff. Specifically, that in Molski v.
Arciero Wine Group (2014) 164 Cal. App. 4th 786, the Court of Appeals
explains that a litigant who choses to brings an action under section 51 of the
UCRA does so “without being exposed to any risk of an adverse judgment for fees.”
(Molski v. Arciero Wine Group (2014) 164 Cal. App. 4th 786, 792.) The
Serns Defendants’ position would effectively eliminate this statutory
protection for plaintiffs who seek to hold defendants liable for ADA violations
under section 51 of the UCRA. Accordingly, the Motion has not shown any
legal basis for an award of attorney’s fees.
Conclusion
Defendants William B. Serns and
Eydie Serns’ Motion for Attorney’s Fees is DENIED.
