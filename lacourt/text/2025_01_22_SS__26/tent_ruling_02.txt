ANALYSIS:
Plaintiff Jose Robles (“Plaintiff”)
filed the instant action against Defendant Peretz Mochkin (“Defendants”) on May
22, 2023. The case was set for trial on November 18, 2024. When Plaintiff
failed to appear, the Court dismissed the action without prejudice. (Minute
Order, 11/18/24.)
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal on December
3, 2024. No opposition to the Motion has been filed to date.
Discussion
The motion is brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, section 473, subdivision (b). Under this statute, an application for relief must be made no more than six months after entry of the order from which relief is sought and must be accompanied by an affidavit of fault attesting to the moving party’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130, 143.) When based on attorney fault with respect to entry of default, default judgment, or involuntary dismissal, a timely request for relief must be granted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) When brought pursuant to the provision for discretionary relief based on party fault, the request must have been filed within a reasonable amount of time. 

The Motion was timely filed two weeks after dismissal of the action and is supported by an attorney affidavit of fault. Plaintiff’s counsel declares that they failed to calendar the correct trial date. (Motion, Iwuchuku Decl., ¶¶3-5.) Therefore, the case must be reinstated under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b).

Plaintiff Jose
Robles’ Motion to Vacate Dismissal is GRANTED. THE DISMISSAL ENTERED ON NOVEMBER
