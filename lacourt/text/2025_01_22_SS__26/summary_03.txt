And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions filed in this case. The first motion is defendant David Allen Benson dba Benson Crane's motion to vacate an order deeming matters admitted. The defendant argues that he was denied due process and equal protection rights, but does not provide any evidence to support this claim. The judge finds that the defendant has not demonstrated a basis for relief under the relevant statute and denies the motion.

The second motion is plaintiff California Automobile Insurance Company's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The plaintiff argues that the defendant has admitted the truth of the allegations in the complaint through his failure to respond to discovery propounded and the resulting order deeming the requests for admission admitted. The judge finds that the admissions in the request for admission directly contradict the general denial and affirmative defenses asserted in the defendant's answer and grants the motion for judgment on the pleadings. The plaintiff is ordered to file and serve a proposed judgment within 20 days.
