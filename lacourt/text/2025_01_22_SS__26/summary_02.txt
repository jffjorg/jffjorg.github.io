And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Plaintiff Jose Robles' motion to vacate the dismissal of his lawsuit against Defendants Peretz Mochkin et al. The lawsuit was initially dismissed on November 18, 2024, after Plaintiff failed to appear in court. However, Plaintiff's counsel has since filed a motion to vacate the dismissal, citing a mistake and failure to calendar the correct trial date. The judge has found that the motion is timely and supported by an attorney affidavit of fault, and therefore has reinstated the lawsuit. The judge has also set an Order to Show Cause regarding the failure to file proof of service of summons and complaint for March 26, 2025.
