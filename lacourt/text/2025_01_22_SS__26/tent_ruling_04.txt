ANALYSIS:
On September 6,
2024, Petitioner Weiss Family Properties, LLC (“Petitioner”) filed the instant Petition
for Permanent Injunction Pursuant to Civil Code section 798.88 against
Respondent George Waterman (“Respondent”). No response to the Petition has been
filed to date.
Discussion
Petitioner moves
pursuant to Civil Code section 786.88 for an order enjoining Respondent from
continuing violations of the rules of Petitioner’s Mobile Home Park, Royal Oaks
Mobile Home Park (“the Park”), located at 18145 Soledad Canyon Road, Canyon
Country, California. (Pet., ¶¶2-3.) Respondents’ Mobilehome is located on Space
33 of the Park. (Id. at ¶4.) Respondent’s violations include failing to
adjust the pole awnings that encroach on neighboring spaces, failing to comply
with Title 25 § 1428(2)(A)(B) regarding proper placement of awning poles in
relation to closeness of lot lines, failing to remove improperly stored items
beyond the lot line, failing to comply with federal, state, and/or local law,
including but not limited to California Code of Regulations Title 25 §§ 1018,
1130, 1428, and 1606, failing to cease all erratic and harassing behavior when
addressing Park Management, and failing to comply with the Rental Agreement,
Park Rules and Regulations, and Title 25. (Id. at ¶7 and Exhs. 1-2.)
Petitioner
requests an injunction against Respondent prohibiting further violations and an
award of reasonable attorney fees and costs. (Id. at p. 6:4-22.)
Legal Standard
The Mobilehome Residency Law (“MRL”) gives management an
injunctive relief remedy for violations of reasonable park rules and
regulations. (Civ. Code, § 798.88.) Specifically, management may obtain a
restraining order against a continuing or recurring violation of any
“reasonable rule or regulation.” (Civ. Code, § 798.88, subd. (b); Rancho
Santa Paula Mobilehome Park, Ltd. v. Evans (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 1139,
1142.) At the time of the hearing, the court shall issue the injunction if it
finds by clear and convincing evidence the existence of a continuing or
recurring violation of a “reasonable rule or regulation.” (Civ. Code, § 798.88,
subd. (d).) The duration of the injunction may not exceed three years. (Civ.
Code, § 798.88, subd. (d).)
Discussion
Although the moving statute does not provide for a specific
notice period, Respondent is entitled to reasonable notice prior to issuance of
an order on the Petition. (See Menefee & Son v. Dent. of Food
&Agriculture (1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 774, 781.) Failure to give notice is
a violation of due process. (Jones v. Otero (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 754,
757.) Petitioner filed proof of substitute service on September 20, 2024,
demonstrating that Respondent was served by substitute service and posting on
September 15, 2024. (Proofs of Personal Service, ¶3.) Therefore, Petitioner has
provided Respondent with reasonable notice.
A verified petition, as required under the moving statute
must be made pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 446, which states: “When
a corporation is a party, the verification may be made by any officer thereof.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 446, subd. (a).) The verification of this Petition,
however, does not indicate it was made by an officer of the corporate
Plaintiff. Rather it is signed by “Authorized Agent for Petitioner,” who does
not provide their name or title. Also, “when the verification is made on behalf
of a corporation or public agency by any officer thereof, the attorney’s or
officer’s affidavit shall state that he or she has read the pleading and that
he or she is informed and believes the matters therein to be true and on that
ground alleges that the matters stated therein are true. However, in those
cases the pleadings shall not otherwise be considered as an affidavit or
declaration establishing the facts therein alleged.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 446,
subd. (a).) Therefore, Petitioner cannot rely solely on the facts set forth in,
or the exhibits attached to, the Petition as evidence in support of the
injunction sought against Respondent.
Based on the foregoing, the hearing on the Petition is
continued to give Petitioner an opportunity to correct these defects.
