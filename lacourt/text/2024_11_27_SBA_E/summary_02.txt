```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendants' motion to expunge the lis pendens, which was filed by the plaintiffs. The defendants argue that the lis pendens should be expunged because the plaintiffs' complaint does not contain a real property claim that affects the title or possession of the subject property. The judge finds that the complaint does not contain a real property claim that has probable validity, and that the defendants have established that the probable validity of any real property claim is lacking. The judge also finds that the plaintiffs' argument that the motion is premature because they have until November 22, 2024, to file an amended complaint is unsupported by legal authority. Therefore, the judge grants the motion to expunge the lis pendens.
