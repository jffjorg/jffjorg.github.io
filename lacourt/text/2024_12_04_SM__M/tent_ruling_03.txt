MOTION:                     Demurrer to the Third Amended
Cross-Complaint  
HEARING DATE:   12/4/2024
 
 
LEGAL STANDARD 
 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether
the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be
apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed. (CCP §§ 430.30, 430.70.) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff
need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the
factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28
Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) A “demurrer does not, however, admit contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the pleading, or the
construction of instruments pleaded, or facts impossible in law.” (S. Shore
Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732, internal citations
omitted.) 
 
“Liberality in permitting amendment is
the rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect has not been given.” (Angie
M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227.) It is an abuse of
discretion for the court to deny leave to amend where there is any reasonable
possibility that plaintiff can state a good cause of action. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) The burden is on plaintiff to show¿in
what manner¿plaintiff can amend the complaint, and¿how¿that
amendment will change the legal effect of the pleading.¿(Id.) 
 
ANALYSIS 
 
Defendant Scott Morgan demurs to Cross-Complainant Roger Camras’
Third Amended Cross-Complaint (“TACC”), including the Second (Fraud), Third
(Ejectment), and Fourth (Financial Elder Abuse) causes of action. Cross-Complainant
admits that Cross-Defendant is no longer in possession of the Property and therefore,
the demurrer to the Third Cause of Action for Ejectment is moot.
 
Fraud
            
Defendant argues that the complaint fails to allege fraud with
specificity, in particular, the knowledge of falsity, intent to defraud, and
justifiable reliance elements. The elements of fraud are: “(a)
misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b)
knowledge of falsity (or ‘scienter’); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce
reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage.” (Charnay v.
Cobert (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 170, 184.) In California, fraud must be pled
with specificity. (Small v. Fritz Companies, Inc. (2003) 30 Cal.4th 167,
184.) “The particularity demands that a plaintiff plead facts which show how,
when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were tendered.” (Cansino
v. Bank of America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1469.)  
 
Generally, the TACC alleges that on September 1, 2009, Cross-Defendant
introduced Ric St. John to Cross-Complainant, who desired to rent a room at the
Property. (SACC ¶ 13.) Cross-Defendant “represented that Ric St. John was
honest, reputable, clean, and would pay the agreed rent and would otherwise be
a good tenant. Cross-defendant SCOTT MORGAN did not disclose any history by Ric
St. John of destruction of property, criminal activity, identity theft, or
violence.” (¶14.) Cross-Complainant relied on the representations of
Cross-defendant SCOTT MORGAN and believed them to be true. (¶ 15.) The
representations were false and, at the time he made them, Cross-defendant knew
that the representations were false. (¶16.) Cross-Defendant failed to disclose
facts which materially qualify the representations and render his disclosure
misleading. (Id.) He knew that this was false at the time, as he has admitted
to longstanding prior knowledge of Ric St. John’s history as a con-artist,
criminal, and thief. (Id.) If Cross-complainant had known the truth regarding
Ric St. John’s history of dishonest behavior, he would have never been allowed
to step foot on the Property or be a tenant. (¶ 18.) Thus,
the TACC alleges justifiable reliance and knowledge of falsity, with specific
supporting facts.
 
Cross-Defendant notes that an express allegation of an
intent to defraud/induce reliance is absent from the TACC. However, the
circumstances alleged establishes an inference that Cross-Defendant intended to
induce Cross-Complainant into the Lease with St. John. (Perez v. Golden
Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 1228, 1238 [courts must
liberally draw inferences favorable to the non-demurring party]; Buller v.
Sutter Health (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 981, 986 [the court must assume the
truth of facts that may be implied or reasonably inferred from the express
allegations].) In fraud causes of action, a “defendant's
intent to induce the plaintiff to alter his position can be inferred from the
fact that defendant knew the plaintiff would act in reliance upon the
representation.” (Eddy v. Sharp, (1988) 199 Cal. App. 3d 858, 864.)
Here, the specific allegations demonstrate that Cross-Defendant misrepresented St.
John as “honest, reputable, clean, and would pay the agreed rent and would
otherwise be a good tenant” without disclosing a known history of destruction
of property, criminal activity, identity theft, or violence. Cross-Defendant
represented St. John as an acceptable tenant with the apparent purpose for
Cross-Complainant to rely on such representations and lease the property to St.
John. From such facts, the Court can reasonably infer that Cross-Defendant intended
to induce reliance on his express misrepresentations.
 
Accordingly,
the demurrer is OVERRULED.
 
Financial
Elder Abuse
 
Defendant demurs to the elder abuse cause of action on the
grounds that the TACC does not allege that Cross-Defendant retained the
Property for wrongful use or with the intent to defraud Cross-Defendant and acted
with recklessness, malice, oppression, or fraud.
 
A plaintiff claiming elder abuse must
allege (1) she is an elder adult and (2) a defendant took, secreted,
appropriated, or retained her real or personal property, or assisted another to
do so, (3) to a wrongful use, with an intent to defraud, or by undue influence.
(Welf. & Inst. Code § 15610.30 (a); Teselle v. McLoughlin (2009) 173
Cal.App.4th 156, 174.) For the purposes of the abuse statute, an
elder means any person residing in this state, 65 years of age or older.” (Welf.
& Inst. Code § 15610.27.) “[A] wrongful use is defined as taking,
secreting, appropriating, or retaining property in bad faith. Bad faith occurs
where the person or entity knew or should have known that the elder had the
right to have the property transferred or made readily available to the elder
or to his or her representative. [Citation.]” (Teselle v. McLoughlin
(2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 156, 174.)
 
The TACC alleges that by ousting Cross-Complainant
from the Property and squatting in the Property against Cross-Complainant’s
will, Cross-Defendant took or retained an elder’s property for a wrongful use
with the intent to defraud. (SACC ¶¶ 36-37.) The wrongful use and fraud are
premised on the prior causes of action for breach of lease and fraud. As
discussed infra, the TACC establishes a cause of action for fraud. Further, the
breach of lease cause of action is not challenged. Thus, Cross-Defendant is alleged
to be wrongfully retaining the Property with an intent to defraud.
 
Accordingly,
the demurrer is OVERRULED.
