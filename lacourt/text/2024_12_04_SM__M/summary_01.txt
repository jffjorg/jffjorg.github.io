And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is ruling on two motions related to expert witnesses. The plaintiff, Cienega Ventures LLC, is seeking to add an expert witness, Hossain Motamedi, to their list of witnesses. The defendants, 730 North La Cienega, LLC and Koi LP, are moving to strike the plaintiff's late addition to the witness list. The judge finds that the plaintiff failed to show good cause for leave and that there are no exceptional circumstances that justify their failure to disclose and depose the expert witness in advance. The judge denies the plaintiff's motion and grants the defendant's motion to strike the expert witness.
