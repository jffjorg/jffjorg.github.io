The plaintiff opposes the motion, but does not provide any responses. The judge finds that the motion is timely and that the plaintiff has failed to provide initial responses to the discovery requests. The judge orders the plaintiff to provide responses without objections within 10 days and imposes sanctions of $585 per motion against the plaintiff, payable within 30 days.
