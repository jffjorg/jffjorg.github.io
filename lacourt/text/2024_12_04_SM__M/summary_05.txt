And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion to seal certain documents lodged in connection with the petition to compel compliance with arbitration subpoenas. The documents in question contain information disclosed by former CAA members that contains CAA's proprietary, confidential, and trade secret information. The court finds that CAA has an overriding interest in protecting this information from public disclosure and potential market competitors, and that the proposed redactions are narrowly tailored to confidential information. The court notes that the First Amendment right of public access to civil trials is protected by the California Rules of Court, and that the proposed sealing is necessary to achieve this overriding interest.
