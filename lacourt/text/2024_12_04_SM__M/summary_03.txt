And here is the summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the Third Amended Cross-Complaint filed by Scott Morgan, the Cross-Defendant. The demurrer argues that the Cross-Complaint fails to state a cause of action for fraud, ejectment, and financial elder abuse.

The Judge has ruled that the demurrer for fraud is OVERRULED. The Cross-Complaint alleges that Scott Morgan misrepresented Ric St. John as a honest and reputable tenant, without disclosing his prior history of destruction of property, criminal activity, identity theft, or violence. The Court can reasonably infer that Scott Morgan intended to induce reliance on his express misrepresentations.

The Judge has also ruled that the demurrer for financial elder abuse is OVERRULED. The Cross-Complaint alleges that Scott Morgan took or retained the Property for a wrongful use with the intent to defraud, and that he ousted the Cross-Complainant from the Property against their will.

The Judge has ordered Scott Morgan to file an answer to the Cross-Complaint within 20 days.
