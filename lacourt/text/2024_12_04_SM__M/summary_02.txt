And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by the Court-Appointed Referee, Stephen J. Donell, to approve the Referee's counsel's final fee application. The Referee is seeking approval for interim fees and costs paid in the amount of $141,405.94, fees and costs incurred for October 2024 in the amount of $8,552.89, and authorization to holdback $20,000 for Counsel to complete the matter. The motion is substantively unopposed, except for limited opposition from Defendant Norris, who is opposing the Referee's request to "surcharge" him in the amount of $13,260.00. However, the Court finds that the Referee's motion does not request a "surcharge" and that Norris's opposition is untimely and can be disregarded. Therefore, the Referee's motion is granted, and the Court approves the requested fees, costs, and holdback.
