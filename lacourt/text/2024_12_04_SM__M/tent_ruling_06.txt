MOTION:                     Demurrer to the
Complaint  
HEARING DATE:   12/4/2024
 
LEGAL STANDARD 
 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether
the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be
apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed. (CCP §§ 430.30, 430.70.) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff
need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the
factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28
Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) A “demurrer does not, however, admit contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the pleading, or the
construction of instruments pleaded, or facts impossible in law.” (S. Shore
Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732, internal citations
omitted.) 
 
A special demurrer for uncertainty is
disfavored and will only be sustained where the pleading is so bad that
defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e., cannot reasonably determine what
issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are directed
against him/her. (CCP § 430.10(f); Khoury v. Maly’s of Calif., Inc.
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) Moreover, even if the pleading is somewhat
vague, “ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Ibid.)  
  
“Liberality in permitting amendment is
the rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect has not been given.” (Angie
M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227.) It is an abuse of
discretion for the court to deny leave to amend where there is any reasonable
possibility that plaintiff can state a good cause of action. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) The burden is on plaintiff to show¿in
what manner¿plaintiff can amend the complaint, and¿how¿that
amendment will change the legal effect of the pleading.¿(Id.) 
 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE 
 
Defendant’s request for judicial notice is GRANTED. (Evid.
Code § 452(c), (d).)  Plaintiff’s request
for judicial notice is DENIED as to nos. 3-4 (discovery responses) and GRANTED
as to the remainder. (Evid. Code § 452(d).)  

 
ANALYSIS
 
Defendant 1238–1242 10th Street Owner, LLC (hereinafter,
the “Successor Owner”) demurs to each cause of action of Plaintiff Shawn Ryan’s
complaint. Successor Owner argues that the first five causes of action fail
because it is not a party to Plaintiff’s employment agreement with 1238 10th
Street, LLC (hereinafter, the “Former Owner”) and was never Plaintiff’s
employer. Successor Owner asserts that the wrongful eviction claims fail for a
similar reason: Successor Owner was not the owner of the Property at the
relevant time. Successor Owner applies the same reasoning to the remaining
causes of action to conclude that the entirety of the Complaint fails to state
a claim.
 
Between May 12, 2023, and September 12, 2023, Plaintiff
worked for Defendants as a residential manager of a residential building
located at 1238-1242 10th Street, Santa Monica. (Compl., ¶¶ 1, 17.) Defendants
were the employers of Plaintiff. (Compl., ¶ 19.) As part of his employment, Plaintiff
was given possession of one of the units on the Property (“Unit 10”). (Compl.,
¶ 2.) On September 12, 2023, the Former Owner served Plaintiff with a Notice of
Management Termination (“Termination Notice”), which required that he vacate
the Unit within three days. (Compl., ¶ 3 & Ex. B.) Upon receiving the
Termination Notice, Plaintiff realized that Defendants had “robbed” him of
wages related to his work as residential manager, since they had paid him no
wages whatsoever, including overtime. (Compl., ¶ 4.) 
 
            Successor Owner
observes that the attached Employment Agreement for Employee Manager shows that
Plaintiff’s agreement was with the Former Owner. (Compl., Ex. A.) Further,
Plaintiff was terminated in September 2023, prior to the transfer of the
property to Successor Owner in December 2023. (Compl., ¶ 10.) Despite these
facts, the Court believes that the Successor Owner may be liable on a successor-liability
theory. 
 
A successor company has liability for a predecessor's actions if:
(1) the successor expressly or impliedly agrees to assume the subject
liabilities; (2) the transaction amounts to a consolidation or merger of the
successor and the predecessor, (3) the successor is a mere continuation of the
predecessor, or (4) the transfer of assets to the successor is for the
fraudulent purpose of escaping liability for the predecessor's debts. (Ray
v. Alad Corporation (1977) 19 Cal.3d 224; Ukegawa Bros. v. Agric. Lab.
Rels. Bd., (1989) 212 Cal. App. 3d 1314, 1320 [entity which commits an
unfair labor practice is liable for its consequences even if the entity has
changed form subsequent to commission of the unfair labor practice]; see also Golden
State Bottling Co. v. NLRB (1973) 414 U.S. 168, 186-187 [successor
corporation jointly liable with former corporation where successor purchased
with knowledge of the unfair labor practice litigation and that the wrong
remains unremedied].)
 
The
Complaint alleges as a matter of fact that on December 29, 2023, the Successor
Owner agreed to share in the employer responsibilities of the Former Owner,
including those concerning the liability of unpaid wages and related
violations of the Labor Code. (Compl., ¶ 5.) The attached Agreement does
not negate the existence of the express agreement assuming liability between
Defendants. Given the allegation of an express agreement to assume the subject
liabilities, the demurrer cannot be sustained as to the employment-based
causes.
 
The Complaint
also alleges that Successor Owner is a successor to Plaintiff’s lease agreement,
or at least establishes the existence of a landlord-tenant relationship between
the parties. The Complaint alleges that the Successor Owner is the “successor
in interest” of the Former Owner’s interest in the Property. (Id., ¶ 10; RJN
Ex. 1 [grant deed issued on December 29, 2023, and recorded on January 2, 2024].)
The Complaint alleges that Plaintiff’s leasehold rights continued through the
termination of his employment. Upon his termination, Plaintiff expressly
informed them about his tenancy rights on the same day and his election to
remain the resident in the unit, as provided for in the written agreement. (Compl.,
¶ 21.) Successor Owner allegedly interfered with Plaintiff’s exclusive
possession of the Unit under the written agreement after obtaining title.
(Compl., ¶ 72.) The judicially noticeable record also makes clear that
Plaintiff continued in possession of the Unit until May 10, 2024, well after
Successor Owner gained interest in the subject property.
 
Successor Owner cites a provision in the agreement
which disclaims any tenancy interest. Successor Owner does not show that
paragraph 3 of the Agreement would control the definition of a tenancy or legally
preclude a tenancy. Successor Owner posits no authority that the parties have
the ability to waive tenancy rights pursuant to employment contracts involving
the lease of a residential property. (See CCSM § 1807 “[Any provision, whether
oral or written in or pertaining to a rental housing agreement whereby any provision
of this Article for the benefit of the tenant is waived, shall be deemed to be
against public policy and shall be void”].) Notwithstanding the labeling, the agreement
unambiguously provides for Plaintiff’s exclusive occupation, possession, and residency
of Unti 10. Thus, absent further authority, the Complaint states a
landlord-tenant relationship between Successor Owner and Plaintiff.
 
Successor Owner lodges the same objections to the Negligence and UCL causes. The arguments are rejected for the same
reasons discussed infra. 
 
Accordingly, the demurrer is OVERRULED.  Successor Owner to file an answer within 20
days.
