Defendants.CASE NO: 23TRCV02429 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE: MOTION TO COMPEL ARBITRATION Dept. P 10:00 a.m.March 18, 2024BACKGROUNDOn July 27, 2023, Plaintiff Griffin Leonard filed the complaint against Defendants Subaru of America, Inc. (“Subaru”), Good Son, LLC. dba Subaru Pacific (erroneously sued as “South Bay Motors, LLC”), and Does 1-100 for violation of Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, Civ.C § 1790 et seq. Plaintiff contends Defendants sold him a defective used 2017 Subaru Forester (the “Vehicle”) with a certified pre-owned warranty on August 30, 2022, with a cash price of $32,496.96. After purchase, the Vehicle started showing a loss of power, a Check Engine light, and other symptoms. Plaintiff brought the Vehicle in to a manufacturer-authorized dealership on February 10, 2023, and again on March 30, 2023, but the Vehicle was not fixed. Plaintiff brought it in a third time on May 31, 2023 and the dealership kept it for six weeks but did not fix it.Subaru filed the Answer on August 31, 2023, asserting sixteen (16) affirmative defenses, including that Plaintiff’s claims may be subject to an arbitration agreement. (Answer, para. 6.)On December 4, 2023, Subaru filed the instant motion to compel arbitration, along with a request for judicial notice.On March 11, 2024, Defendants filed a notice of non-opposition.To date, Plaintiff has not filed an opposition.LEGAL STANDARD“On petition of a party to an arbitration agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a controversy and that a party thereto refuses to arbitrate such controversy, the court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists, unless it determines that:• The right to compel arbitration has been waived by the petitioner; or• Grounds exist for the revocation of the agreement.• A party to the arbitration agreement is also a party to a pending court action or special proceeding with a third party, arising out of the same transaction or series of related transactions and there is a possibility of conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact . . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2.)“If a court of competent jurisdiction, whether in this State or not, has ordered arbitration of a controversy which is an issue involved in an action or proceeding pending before a court of this State, the court in which such action or proceeding is pending shall, upon motion of a party to such action or proceeding, stay the action or proceeding until an arbitration is had in accordance with the order to arbitrate or until such earlier time as the court specifies.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.4.)DISCUSSIONDefendants contend that the parties entered into a contract to arbitrate any controversy arising between them out of the purchase of the Vehicle.As an initial matter, the Court grants Defendants’ request for judicial notice of the complaint and the answers.On August 30, 2022, Plaintiff and Subaru Pacific entered into a sales contract regarding Plaintiff’s purchase of a used 2017 Subaru Forester, entitled “Retail Installment Sale Contract-Simple Finance Charge (With Arbitration Provision).” (Subaru Pacific Decl., Exh. A.) On the first page of the Sales Contract, Plaintiff signed a box signifying his agreement to arbitrate “any dispute” in accordance with the detailed arbitration provision (“Arbitration Provision”) contained in the contract. Plaintiff also signed under following provision acknowledging agreement to the Arbitration Provision:YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS CONTRACT. YOU CONFIRM THAT BEFORE YOU SIGNED THIS CONTRACT, WE GAVE IT TO YOU, AND YOU WERE FREE TO TAKE IT AND REVIEW IT. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ ALL PAGES OF THIS CONTRACT, INCLUDING THE ARBITRATION PROVISION ON PAGE 7 OF THIS CONTRACT, BEFORESIGNING BELOW. YOU CONFIRM THAT YOU RECEIVED A COMPLETELY FILLED-IN COPY WHEN YOU SIGNED IT.Additionally, the detailed terms of the Arbitration Provision were set forth on page 7 of the contract under “ARBITRATION PROVISION PLEASE REVIEW – IMPORTANT – AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS”:“1. EITHER YOU OR WE MAY CHOOSE TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN US DECIDED BY ARBITRATION AND NOT IN COURT OR BY JURY TRIAL.2. IF A DISPUTE IS ARBITRATED, YOU WILL GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER ON ANY CLASS CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST US INCLUDING ANY RIGHT TO CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY CONSOLIDATION OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS.3. DISCOVERY AND RIGHTS TO APPEAL IN ARBITRATION ARE GENERALLY MORE LIMITED THAN IN A LAWSUIT, AND OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU AND WE WOULD HAVE IN COURT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.”Furthermore, the arbitration provision states:“Any claim or dispute, whether in contract, tort, statute or otherwise (including the interpretation and scope of this Arbitration Provision, and the arbitrability of the claim or dispute), between you and us or our employees, agents, successors or assigns, which arises out of or relates to ]the] purchase or condition of this vehicle, this contract or any resulting transaction or relationship (including any such relationship with third parties who do not sign this contract) shall, at your or our election, be resolved by neutral, binding arbitration and not by a court action.”Here, the complaint alleges violations of the Song-Beverly Act arising from engine and other defects with the Vehicle. Therefore, as the complaint is based on a dispute arising out of the purchase of the Vehicle, the dispute is subject to mandatory arbitration. The fact that Subaru is a non-signatory to the contract does not preclude arbitration because the complaint alleges an agency relationship between the Defendants.Accordingly, the Court finds that Defendants have met their burden of showing the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate the dispute. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2.)Defendants’ motion is unopposed. Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration is GRANTED.Defendants to give notice.DATED: March 18, 2024
