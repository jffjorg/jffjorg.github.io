And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel arbitration in this case. The plaintiff, Griffin Leonard, purchased a used 2017 Subaru Forester from Subaru Pacific, which was sold with a certified pre-owned warranty. However, the vehicle had defects and was not fixed despite multiple attempts to repair it. The plaintiff filed a complaint alleging violations of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The defendants, Subaru of America, Inc. and Good Son, LLC, filed a motion to compel arbitration, arguing that the parties entered into a contract to arbitrate any disputes arising out of the purchase of the vehicle.

The judge found that the plaintiff signed an arbitration provision in the sales contract, which provided for mandatory arbitration of disputes arising out of the purchase or condition of the vehicle. The judge also found that the complaint is based on a dispute arising out of the purchase of the vehicle, and therefore is subject to mandatory arbitration. The judge granted the defendants' motion to compel arbitration, but noted that the plaintiff has 10 days to file an opposition to the motion.
