[Citation.] [¶] Nor is the settlement binding [on  the minor] until it is endorsed by the trial court.’” (Pearson v. Superior  Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338; see Prob. Code, §§ 3500, 3600, et  seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.)  To  obtain court approval of the settlement of a minor’s claims, the petitioner  must file a complete and “verified petition for approval of the settlement and  must disclose ‘all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of  the compromise.’ [Citations.]” (Barnes v. Western Heritage Ins. Co.  (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 249, 256; see Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)  DISCUSSION       A.   Ryan Escobar  The  petition contains the following information:  Gross  settlement amount:                  $2,160.00 Total  medical expenses:                        $5,325.00 Reductions:                                           $4,205.00 Amount  to be paid/reimbursed from settlement proceeds:    $1,120.00 Attorney’s  fees:                                    $540.00 Net  settlement amount:                         $500.00  Petitioner  has submitted a completed petitions with all required information. The Court approves  the petition to approve the compromise of minor Plaintiff Ryan Escobar’s claims.  The  net settlement amount of $500 is to be transferred to Petitioner for the  benefit of the minor under the California Uniform Transfers to Minors Act.  B.   Reyna Escobar  Section  12a of the petition states that the total amount of negotiated, statutory, and  contractual reductions is $3,675 and the amount to be paid or reimbursed from  the settlement proceeds is $917.50.   Section 12b(5)(b) of the petition, however, lists negotiated reductions that total $3,332.50,  not $3,675.  If $3,332.50 is subtracted  from the total amount of medical expenses ($4,450.00), then $1,117.50 in  medical expenses remain that should be paid or reimbursed from the settlement  proceeds, not $917.50.  Payment of  $917.50 would leave $200.00 in medical expenses unaccounted for.  The Court cannot approve a minor’s compromise  unless it shows that all of the medical expenses that have not been waived or  reduced will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.  The  Court denies the petition to approve the compromise of minor Plaintiff Reyna  Escobar’s claims without prejudice.  CONCLUSION  The  Court GRANTS Petitioner Desiree Escobar’s petition to approve the compromise of  minor Ryan Escobar’s claims.  The Court orders that the net balance of $500.00 is be  transferred to Petitioner Desiree Escobar for the benefit of minor Plaintiff  Ryan Escobar under the California Uniform Transfers to Minors Act.  The  Court DENIES without prejudice Petitioner Desiree Escobar’s petition to approve  the compromise of minor Plaintiff Reyna Escobar’s claims.  Petitioner  is ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Petitioner  is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within  five days.
