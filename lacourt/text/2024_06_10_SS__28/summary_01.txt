And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the petitions from Desiree Escobar, the guardian ad litem for minor plaintiffs Reyna Escobar and Ryan Escobar, to approve the compromises of their claims. The court grants the petition for Ryan Escobar's compromise, ordering that the net settlement amount of $500.00 be transferred to Desiree Escobar for the benefit of Ryan Escobar under the California Uniform Transfers to Minors Act. However, the court denies the petition for Reyna Escobar's compromise without prejudice due to discrepancies in the calculation of medical expenses and reductions. The court orders Desiree Escobar to give notice of this ruling and to file proof of service of the ruling within five days.
