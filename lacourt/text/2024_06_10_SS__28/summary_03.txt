The Court has considered the parties' motions and oppositions and has ruled as follows. Plaintiff Deborah Russell seeks to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission served on Defendant Oscar Castillo. Intervenor Infinity Insurance Company argues that the motion is moot because it is willing to provide discovery responses. However, the Court finds that Intervenor's argument has no authority and grants Plaintiff's motion. The Court also grants Plaintiff's request for sanctions and orders Defendant Oscar Castillo and his counsel to pay Plaintiff $810.00. The Court finds that Defendant's failure to serve timely responses necessitated the motion and that Plaintiff is entitled to sanctions.
