PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to deem admitted the matters specified in requests for admission served on Castillo and to impose sanctions on Castillo. 
Intervenor
asks the Court to deny the motion and impose sanctions on Plaintiff. 
LEGAL STANDARD  
          Code of Civil Procedure section
2033.280 provides: 
“If a party to whom requests for admission are
directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the requests for admission are
directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its
determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The requesting party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(c) The court shall make this order, unless it finds
that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.) 
DISCUSSION  
On February
21, 2022, Plaintiff served requests for admission, set one, on Castillo. Castillo did not serve timely responses and
had not served responses by the time Plaintiff filed this motion on April 8,
2024.  Plaintiff asks the Court to deem
admitted the matters specified in the requests for admission. 
Intervenor
states that Plaintiff’s motion is moot because “Intervenor recently intervened
and is willing, able and authorized to provide responses to discovery” and has “properly
resolved the issue of discovery . . . .” 
(Opposition p. 3.)  Intervenor cites
no authority to support its suggestion that intervention re-sets the clock on discovery
deadlines or exempts the party on whose behalf an intervenor has intervened
from the consequences of failing to respond to requests for admission. 
Intervenor
became “a party to the action” under Code of Civil Procedure section 387 when
the Court granted Intervenor's motion to intervene. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 387, subd. (b).) 
Intervenor sought to “[u]nite with a defendant in resisting the claims
of a plaintiff.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 387,
subd. (b)(2); see Motion to Intervene p. 2.) 
Intervenor argued it would not enlarge the issues in the case because it
would stand “in the shoes” of its insured and assert the same defenses its
insured would have asserted.  (Motion to Intervene
pp. 2-4.) 
Now,
Intervenor is asserting a defense which Castillo could not have asserted: the
Court should excuse Castillo from the consequences of his failure to respond to
Plaintiff’s requests for admission because an Intervenor is "willing, able and authorized" to provide discovery responses. Having
seen no authority supporting Intervenor’s argument, the Court grants Plaintiff’s
motion and deems admitted the matters specified in Plaintiff’s requests for
admission served on Castillo. 
Sanctions
are mandatory under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (c).  Plaintiff requests $2,275.00 in sanctions
based on five hours of attorney time at a rate of $425 per hour plus $150.00 in
costs.  Counsel spent three hours to
prepare the moving papers and anticipated spending another two hours to attend
the hearing.  Counsel estimated that “[t]he
total anticipated costs incurred by Plaintiff for my services in relation to this
Motion, including filing fees, are estimated to be $150.” 
The
Court grants $810.00 in sanctions based on three hours of attorney time at a
reasonable rate of $250.00 per hour plus one $60.00 filing fee. 
CONCLUSION 
          The Court GRANTS Plaintiff Deborah
Russell’s motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission,
set one.  The Court deems the matters
admitted. 
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff Deborah Russell’s request for sanctions and orders Defendant
Oscar Castillo and his counsel to pay Plaintiff Deborah Russell $810.00 within
30 days of the hearing on this motion. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
