And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The defendant argues that it had no duty to protect the plaintiff from the defendant's conduct. The judge finds that the defendant did not have a duty to protect the plaintiff because the defendant did not increase the risk of harm to the plaintiff by hiring a security guard or taking other measures to prevent harm. The judge also finds that the plaintiff did not raise a triable issue of fact regarding whether the defendant could have foreseen the defendant's conduct. Therefore, the judge concludes that the defendant had no duty to protect the plaintiff from the defendant's conduct.
