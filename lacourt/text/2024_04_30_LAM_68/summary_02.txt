And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court sustains the demurrer with leave to amend in order to allow the plaintiff to articulate the basis of liability against Bayless. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to plead a cause of action for fraud or promissory estoppel against Bayless. The court concludes that Bayless is not liable for the plaintiff's termination or the non-payment of the $250,000 payment. The court grants the plaintiff 30 days to amend the complaint to cure the defects identified in the demurrer. The court also declines to consider the alter ego argument submitted by the plaintiff.
