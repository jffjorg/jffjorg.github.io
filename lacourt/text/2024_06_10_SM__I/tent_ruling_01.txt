  Case Number:  19SMCV01876    Hearing Date:   June 10, 2024    Dept:  I At the last hearing, the court gave the parties additional
time to submit declarations concerning the court’s tentative decision at
plaintiff’s request.  Plaintiff did not
file a timely statement.  Rather, on
Thursday after hours, plaintiff filed a declaration.  First, it is not clear that plaintiff gave
notice to the defendant of the court’s prior order—there is no proof of service
in the file.  Second, the declaration is
untimely.  While the court has sympathy
for plaintiff’s family situation, no statement was made at the time of the
event—even a very short one page request for a continuance.  Third, there is no proof that the
supplemental statement was served on defendant. 
All in all, and given plaintiff’s pattern of late or incomplete filings
that has been prevalent throughout this case, the court STRIKES the late-filed
document.  As such, the court will adhere
to its tentative.  The court will draft a
judgment and enter it in due course.  The
court will set a non-appearance date to make sure that this does not fall
through the cracks.  Court will give
notice.
