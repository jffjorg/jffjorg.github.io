And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the demurrer brought by Berry Gordy and has determined that the allegations against him are within the statutory period. Gordy had argued that the alleged acts occurred outside the statutory period, but the court has found that the allegations of abuse by Rockwell and aid and abetment by Gordy occurred within the statutory period. The court has also found that Gordy's alleged actions in facilitating Rockwell's abuse and interfering with Thompson's ability to seek help may have caused her to delay in filing suit, and therefore, the court has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend. The court has given Thompson 30 days to amend the complaint to address the issues raised in the demurrer.
