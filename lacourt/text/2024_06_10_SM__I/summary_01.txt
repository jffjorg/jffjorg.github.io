And here is the English-text summary:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling in a case that has been marked by plaintiff's pattern of late or incomplete filings. At the last hearing, the court gave the parties additional time to submit declarations, but plaintiff failed to provide a timely statement. Instead, they filed a declaration on the last day of the deadline, without providing proof of service to the defendant. The court finds that this late filing is unacceptable and strikes the document. The court will adhere to its tentative decision and draft a judgment, which will be entered in due course. A non-appearance date will be set to ensure that the case does not fall through the cracks.
