And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has tentatively ruled to grant the motion to continue the trial, despite being reluctant to do so. The case involves an auto accident and multiple lawsuits, including one filed by Saadian and another filed by Panuco, a defendant in Saadian's case and a plaintiff in his own case. The judge is concerned about the risk of inconsistent verdicts or judgments if the cases are tried separately. After considering the parties' requests and the court's docket, the judge has decided to consolidate the cases for all purposes, including trial, and will vacate the current FSC and trial dates. The judge will discuss the new trial date with the parties as early in 2025 as possible, and no further continuances will be granted absent extraordinary circumstances.
