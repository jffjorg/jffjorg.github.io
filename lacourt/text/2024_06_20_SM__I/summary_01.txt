And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motion to file a cross-complaint is granted. The cross-complaint is compulsory under the rules, and the judge does not see any bad faith in the defendant's delay in bringing the motion. The court finds that the parties were in settlement discussions, which may have delayed the filing of the motion. The judge also notes that the trial date is far enough away to allow for the cross-complaint to be ready for trial on schedule. The plaintiff argued that the cross-complaint is futile due to the statute of limitations, but the court believes this is a better argument for demurrer or summary judgment rather than an argument against the defendant's right to bring the action. The defendant is granted permission to file a stand-alone cross-complaint within five court days, and the plaintiff will have the time allowed by law to answer or respond.
