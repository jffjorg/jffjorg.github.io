English-text summary:

This tentative ruling concerns a motion to compel further responses to certain discovery requests. The plaintiff, Delilah Weitz, filed a complaint against the defendants, Volkswagen Group of America, Inc. and Galpin Volkswagen, LLC dba Galpin Volkswagen, alleging violations of the Song-Beverly Act and negligent repair. The defendants served responses to the plaintiff's discovery requests, but the plaintiff argues that the responses are incomplete and inadequate. The court finds that the defendants' responses are not timely, as they were served without verification, and that the plaintiff's meet and confer requirements were met. The court grants the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses as to certain requests and orders the defendants to produce documents within 20 days. The court also denies the motion as to other requests as moot and imposes sanctions on the defendants and their counsel in the amount of $1,185.
