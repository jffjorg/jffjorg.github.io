Moving Party:           Teresa

TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff’s renewed motion to lift arbitration stay and request for
sanctions are denied.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This is a “wage and
hour” action.  Atlas makes aerospace
parts.  Plaintiff worked for Atlas for
five years.  She claims Atlas failed to
provide overtime pay, meal breaks, sick leave, etc. and violated the Labor
Code, Unfair Competition Law, and Private Attorneys General Act.
 
In December 2021,
the Court granted Atlas’s motion to compel arbitration and stayed the action.
 
In late November
2022, the Court heard Plaintiff’s motion to lift the arbitration stay and
continued the hearing for supplemental briefing.
 
(2/1/23 Ruling
Re: Supplemental Briefs Re: Motion to Lift Arbitration Stay, p. 1.)
 
On 2/1/23, the Court considered
the supplemental briefs, denied Plaintiff’s motion, and denied her request for
sanctions.  (See id. at pp. 1, 7.)
 
On 3/30/23, Plaintiff filed a
petition for writ of mandate.  (See
Harris Decl., ¶ 4.)
 
On 6/9/23, the Second District
Court of Appeal denied Plaintiff’s petition, finding that Plaintiff “fail[ed]
to establish entitlement to extraordinary relief.”  (Id. at Ex. B.) 
 
On 11/17/23, Plaintiff filed a
renewed motion to lift the arbitration stay.
 
Now, the Court considers the
renewed motion.
 
DISCUSSION
 
The
Court begins with the relevant facts:
 
* On 12/9/21, the
Court held an evidentiary hearing with live testimony, compelled arbitration,
and stayed the case.
 
* On 5/11/22,
“Plaintiff sent an arbitration demand to the American Arbitration Association
(‘AAA’)[.]”  [Citation.]
 
* On 5/12/22, the
AAA emailed a letter to defense counsel, requesting that Defendant pay its
share of the arbitration filing fee by 6/11/22. 
[Citation.]
 
* On 5/19/22, AAA
received Defendant’s share of the arbitration fee.  [Citation.]
 
* On 7/22/22,
emailed an invoice to defense counsel “for a $3,900 ‘Deposit of Arbitrator’s
Compensation covering preliminary matters,’ which was for anticipated further
fees.”  [Citations.]
 
* On 8/19/22,
defense counsel cut a check for $3,900. 
[Citations.]
 
* On 8/22/22,
defense counsel mailed the check to AAA. 
[Citations.]
 
* On 8/23/22, AAA
“informed the parties that AAA had not received the $3,900 []payment[.]”  [Citations.]
 
* Also, on 8/23/22,
defense counsel “made a second $3,900 payment via credit card . . . in the
event that the check did not timely arrive,” but Plaintiff announced that she
would be withdrawing from the arbitration. 
[Citations.]
 
* On 8/24/22, AAA
confirmed reception of the electronic payment on 8/23/22.  [Citation.]
 
* On 9/7/22, the
arbitrator stayed the arbitration to give this Court an opportunity to consider
the withdrawal issue.  [Citation.]
 
(11/30/22
Tentative Ruling Re: Motion to Lift Arbitration Stay, pp. 2-3.)
 
Plaintiff contends she has a
right to withdraw from the arbitration because Defendant “paid the $3,900
amount on 8/23/22, more than 30 days after receiving the 7/22/22 invoice[.]”
(2/1/23 Ruling Re: Supplemental Briefs Re: Motion to Lift Arbitration Stay, p.
4.)  Her argument is based on Code of
Civil Procedure section 1281.98, which sets a 30-day deadline to pay “‘the fees
or costs required to continue’ an arbitration proceeding[.]”  (DeLeon v. Juanita’s Foods (2022) 85
Cal.App.5th 740, 750, emphasis deleted.)  Plaintiff asserts that “section 1281.98’s
payment deadline must be applied ‘strictly’” and that there are no exceptions
for late payments.  (2/1/23 Ruling Re:
Supplemental Briefs Re: Motion to Lift Arbitration Stay, p. 4.)
 
Defendant claims Code of Civil
Procedure section 1010.6 “governs because the arbitrator emailed the invoice to
defense counsel.”  (Ibid.)  Under section 1010.6,   
 
[a]ny
period of notice, or any right or duty to do any act or make any response
within any period or on a date certain after the service of the document, which
time period or date is prescribed by statute or rule of court, shall be
extended after service by electronic means by two court days, but the extension
shall not apply to extend the time for filing any of the following:
 
(i) A
notice of intention to moved for new trial.
 
(ii) A
notice of intention to move to vacate judgment under Section 663a.
 
(iii) A notice
of appeal.
 
(Code Civ. Proc. §
1010.6, subd. (a)(4)(B).)  Defendant contends the 8/23/22
payment “was timely because section 1010.6 added two court days to section
1281.98’s payment deadline.”  (2/1/23
Ruling Re: Supplemental Briefs Re: Motion to Lift Arbitration Stay, p. 4.)
 
At the last hearing, the Court
agreed with Defendant and denied Plaintiff’s first motion.  (See id. at pp. 1, 7.)
 
The question here is whether
Plaintiff’s renewed motion should be granted.
 
The renewed motion is brought pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 1008(b). 
(See Notice of Renewed Motion, p. 2.) 
Section 1008(b) provides that,
 
[w]hen a motion has been
denied in whole or in part, the moving party (only) may apply again for the
same relief at a later time, but only on the following conditions:
 
* The motion must be based
on “new or different facts, circumstances or law” [citation];
 
* The motion must be
supported by declaration showing the previous order, by which judge it was
made, and what new or different facts, circumstances or law are claimed to
exist [citation].
 
(Edmon & Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide:
Civ. Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group June 2023 Update) ¶ 9:337; see
also Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 1008, subd. (b).)[1]
 
Plaintiff claims the
renewed motion satisfies section 1008(b). 
Following the denial of her first motion, the First District Court of
Appeal issued an opinion in a case called Doe v. Superior Court (2023)
95 Cal.App.5th 346.  Doe mandates strict enforcement of
section 1281.98’s payment deadline.  (See
Doe, supra, 95 Cal.App.5th at 358.)  Plaintiff contends Doe is new, analogous, and controlling and
compels the Court to grant the renewed motion. 
(See Renewed Motion, pp. 8-9; see also Reply, pp. 3-4, 5-6.)
 
Defendant
disagrees.  Defendant contends section
1008(b) is unsatisfied because Doe: 
 
* relies on old case law
that the Court already reviewed (see Opposition, p. 11 [highlighting, for
example, Espinoza v. Superior Court (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th
761]); and
 
* is distinguishable
since it fails to discuss section 1010.6. 
(See id. at pp. 11-12.)
 
The Court believes Doe
is new in the sense that it came down after the first motion was denied, but it
fails to change the result.  Last time,
the Court denied the first motion despite acknowledging the
applicability of the “strict enforcement” principle.  (See 2/1/23 Ruling Re: Supplemental Briefs Re: Motion to Lift
Arbitration Stay, p. 5.)  To repeat, the Court found that section
1010.6 applies in this case, extending section 1281.98’s payment deadline by
two court days.  (See 2/1/23 Ruling Re: Supplemental
Briefs Re: Motion to Lift Arbitration Stay, pp. 1, 7.)[2]  Doe
does not mention section 1010.6.  The
justices did not analyze the issue of section 1010.6’s application to, and
impact on, the payment deadline.  Consequently,
Doe is distinguishable, and Plaintiff’s renewed motion is denied.  (See, e.g., People v. Ault (2004) 33
Cal.4th 1250, 1268 n.10 [finding it “axiomatic that cases are not
authority for propositions not considered”]; see also Aixtron, Inc. v. Veeco
Instruments, Inc. (2020) 52 Cal.App.5th 360, 386-387 [same].)[3] [4] [5]
 
Plaintiff’s sanctions
request is also denied.
