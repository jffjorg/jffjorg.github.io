[1] “Unlike a
motion for reconsideration, there is no time limit
under [section] 1008 for the renewal of a previous motion.”  (Edmon & Karnow, supra, at ¶ 9:338.5,
emphasis in original.)


[2]
Also, to repeat, the Second District Court of Appeal denied Plaintiff’s writ.
 


[3]
In Doe, the due date fell on a weekend. 
Notably, the Doe parties and justices had no problem with
extending the payment deadline to account for that circumstance notwithstanding
section 1281.98.  (See Doe, supra,
95 Cal.App.5th at 355 n.4.)


 
[4]
Defendant contends the arbitration agreement’s delegation clause requires the
arbitrator to decide the renewed motion. 
(See Opposition, pp. 8-9.)  The
Court disagrees.  The Court held at the
11/30/22 hearing that it should decide the withdrawal question.  (See 11/30/22 Tentative Ruling Re: Motion to
Lift Arbitration Stay, p. 4.)  The ruling
stands.   


 
[5]
Defendant asserts that Plaintiff waived the right to withdraw by continuing to
remain in the arbitration for over 450 days. 
(See Opposition, pp. 12-14.)  It
is unnecessary to reach this issue.
