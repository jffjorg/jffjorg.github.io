```

And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a future court hearing. In this ruling, the Judge addresses several points of contention between the Plaintiff and Defendant. The Judge notes that unlike a motion for reconsideration, there is no time limit for renewing a previous motion, citing section 1008. The Judge also mentions that the Second District Court of Appeal denied the Plaintiff's writ.

The Judge rejects the Defendant's argument that the arbitration agreement's delegation clause requires the arbitrator to decide the renewed motion. Instead, the Judge holds that it should decide the withdrawal question, as previously ruled at the 11/30/22 hearing.

The Judge also dismisses the Defendant's contention that the Plaintiff waived the right to withdraw by continuing to remain in the arbitration for over 450 days, as it is unnecessary to reach this issue.

The Judge cites two prior cases, Edmon & Karnow and Doe, to support its ruling. The Judge's decision aims to clarify the withdrawal process and ensure that the parties' rights are protected. The Judge will issue a final ruling after considering any further arguments or evidence presented at the upcoming hearing.
