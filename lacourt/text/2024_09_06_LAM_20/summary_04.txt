And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the Motion to Quash filed by Plaintiff Franklin Heldman, which seeks to quash a business record subpoena issued to her former/current employer, City of Monterey Park. The subpoena is considered "overboard" by the judge, as it seeks a wide range of records related to Plaintiff's employment, including personnel files, medical files, and payroll records. The judge cites Code of Civil Procedure ยง 1987.1, which authorizes courts to quash or modify subpoenas to protect parties or non-parties from unreasonable or oppressive demands, including violations of privacy rights. The judge notes that discovery devices are meant to facilitate litigation, not wage it, and that the subpoena at issue is overly broad and infringes on Plaintiff's privacy rights. The judge orders the Motion to Quash to be granted, and counsel are encouraged to submit on the tentative or appear remotely via LACourtConnect due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
