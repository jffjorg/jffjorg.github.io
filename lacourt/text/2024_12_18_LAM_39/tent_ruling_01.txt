MOTION
            Attorney
David P. Beitchman of Beitchman & Zekian, P.C. (“Counsel”) moves to be
relieved as counsel for Defendant Home Furniture International, Inc. (“Defendant”).
 Counsel noticed this motion with a
hearing date January 28, 2025.  In its
order of October 1, 2024 ,based on the parties’ oral stipulation, the Court
advanced the hearing to this date.  (See
October 1, 2024 Minute Order.)  
However, Counsel
has not filed proof of service of the new hearing date on Defendant, Counsel’s
client.  Further, the proof of service of
the notice of motion and motion (form MC-051) filed on September 25, 2024 does
not reflect service on Defendant.  Similarly,
there is no indication Defendant was ever served with the declaration of
counsel in support of the motion (form MC-052) and the proposed order granting
the motion (form MC-053), both of which were also filed on September 25,
2024.  As such, the Court cannot
determine if Defendant received proper notice of the current hearing date or of
the motion itself.  Accordingly, the
Court denies the motion without prejudice for failure to give proper
notice.  
            If
Counsel demonstrates Counsel gave Defendant notice of this hearing date, the
following analysis will apply.
ANALYSIS
Counsel has filed
forms MC-051 and MC-052 and has lodged with the Court a copy of the proposed
order on form MC-053, as required.  (Cal
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.)  Provided
Counsel demonstrates good cause for the withdrawal and shows he gave Defendant
proper notice of the correct hearing date, the Court will grant the
motion.  
As Defendant is an
entity, it cannot represent itself.  (See
CLD Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141,
1145 [“under a long-standing common law rule of procedure, a corporation,
unlike a natural person, cannot represent itself before courts of record in
propria persona, nor can it represent itself through a corporate officer,
director or other employee who is not an attorney. It must be represented by
licensed counsel in proceedings before courts of record”].)  The Court, therefore, in a separate Minute
Order, would also set an order to show cause hearing for lack of representation
of Defendant.
Counsel is ordered
to provide notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
