```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has sustained the defendant's demurrer to the complaint with 20 days leave to amend. The plaintiff's complaint fails to state facts sufficient to state a cause of action and is uncertain. The plaintiff's allegations only support a potential theory of negligence under a bystander theory of negligent infliction of emotional distress or direct theory of negligence. However, the plaintiff has not alleged facts to meet any of the elements of a negligence cause of action. The court finds that the plaintiff has not alleged facts to state a claim based on a bystander recovery theory. The demurrer is sustained because the plaintiff failed to state facts sufficient to state a cause of action and the complaint is uncertain. The court orders the defendant to give notice of this ruling.
