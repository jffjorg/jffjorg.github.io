            Background
 
            Plaintiff filed the Complaint on March 25, 2020. Plaintiff
alleges the following facts. Plaintiff was a tenant and rented a room from
Defendant. Defendant sexually harassed Plaintiff on numerous occasions.
Defendant then evicted Plaintiff when she refused Defendant’s advances and assaulted
and battered her when she warned other potential tenants.  Plaintiff alleges causes of action for: 1. Retaliatory
Eviction; 2. Breach of the Implied Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment; 3. Constructive
Eviction; 4. Battery; 5. Assault; 6. IIED; 7. NIED; 8. Violation of Gov. Code
12955(a); 9. Violation of Gov. Code 12955(f); 10. Violation of Civ. Code 51.9;
11. Violation of California Code of Regulations 12120. 
 
            On September 21, 2023, Defendant’s motion for terminating
sanctions and monetary sanctions was denied. On October 24, 2023, Defendant’s
motion for terminating sanctions and monetary sanctions was denied. On January
16, 2024, Defendant’s third motion for terminating sanctions was denied and
Defendant’s motion for reconsideration of the Court’s prior orders denying same
motion was denied. 
 
            Motions for
Terminating Sanctions 
 
            If a party fails to comply with a court order compelling
discovery responses or attendance at a deposition, the court may impose
monetary, issue, evidence, or terminating sanctions.  CCP § 2025.450(h) (depositions); §
2030.290(c) (interrogatories); § 2031.300(c) (demands for production of
documents).  CCP § 2023.030 provides
that, “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular
discovery method . . . , the court, after notice to any affected party, person,
or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may impose . . .  [monetary, issue, evidence, or terminating]
sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery
process . . . .”  Code of Civil Procedure
§ 2023.010 provides that “[m]isuses of the discovery process include, but are
not limited to, the following:  . .
.  (d) Failing to respond or to submit to
an authorized method of discovery. . . . (g) Disobeying a court order to
provide discovery. . . . .”  
 
            “The trial court may order a terminating sanction for
discovery abuse ‘after considering the totality of the circumstances:  [the] conduct of the party to determine if
the actions were willful; the detriment to the propounding party; and the
number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the discovery.’”  Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th 377, 390
(quoting Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77
Cal. App. 4th 1225, 1246).  “Generally,
‘[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly.  But where a violation is willful, preceded by
a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not
produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in
imposing the ultimate sanction.’”  Los Defensores, 223 Cal. App. 4th
at 390 (citation omitted).   
   
            “Under this standard, trial courts have properly imposed
terminating sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed one or more
discovery orders.”  Los Defensores, 223 Cal. App. 4th at 390 (citing Lang, 77 Cal. App. 4th at 1244-1246
(discussing cases)); see, e.g., Collisson & Kaplan v. Hartunian
(1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 1611, 1617-1622 (terminating sanctions imposed after
defendants failed to comply with one court order to produce discovery); Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange
(1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 481, 491, disapproved on other grounds in Garcia v. McCutchen (1997) 16 Cal. 4th
469, 478, n. 4 (terminating sanctions imposed against plaintiff for failing to
comply with a discovery order and for violating various discovery statutes).
 
            The type of severe sanctions sought by plaintiff such as
issue, evidentiary, and terminating sanctions for failure to comply with a
court order are allowed only where the failure was willful.  See
R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486,
495; See also Vallbona v. Springer (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1525, 1545; See also Biles v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315,
1327.  
 
            “Doomsday” sanctions are reserved for parties who commit
willful, repeated, violations of court orders.  Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez
(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390. 
“Generally, [a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be
made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse,
and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance
with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate
sanction.”  Id.  
 
            Defendant moves, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §
2023.030, for terminating sanctions and other evidentiary and/or issue
sanctions against Plaintiff, a stay of the action until compliance with
discovery orders, and for monetary sanctions. The motion is made on the grounds
that Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel disobeyed the Court’s order to serve
verified responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set Two. 
 
            The Court directs the parties to the Court’s orders of
October 24, 2023, and January 16, 2024 denying motions for terminating
sanctions which were brought upon the exact same grounds. 
 
            Further, the Court notes that the motions are improperly
heard well after the discovery cutoff date. 
 
            Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020 states:
            “(a) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, any
party shall be entitled as a matter of right to complete discovery proceedings
on or before the 30th day, and to have motions concerning discovery heard on or
before the 15th day, before the date initially set for the trial of the action.
            (b) Except as provided in Section 2024.050, a continuance
or postponement of the trial date does not operate to reopen discovery
proceedings.”
 
            Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.030 states:
            “Any party shall be entitled as a matter of right to
complete discovery proceedings pertaining to a witness identified under Chapter
18 (commencing with Section 2034.010) on or before the 15th day, and to have
motions concerning that discovery heard on or before the 10th day, before the
date initially set for the trial of the action.”
 
            Pursuant to CCP § 2024.020(a), the
deadline to complete discovery proceedings is 30 days before the initial trial
date and the deadline for motion hearings on non-expert discovery motions is
fifteen days before the initial trial date. 
 
            “In the context of an action that
has not yet proceeded to trial or otherwise resulted in a dispositive judgment,
the phrase “date initially set for the trial of the action” Code Civ. Proc., §
2024, subd. (a)) is unambiguous. In such instance, it plainly refers to the first
date set for trial of the action. Thus, the statute expressly states that
continuance or postponement of that date will not operate to reopen discovery.”
Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 250 (emphasis
in original). 
 
            On December 20, 2022, the initial trial date was set for
October 31, 2023. On October 24, 2023, the trial date was continued by the
Court to January 24 and 25, 2024. The discovery cutoff date was not continued
however and remained with the initial trial date. On January 16, 2024, the
trial date was vacated. However, again, pursuant to the authorities noted
above, the discovery cutoff date remained with the initial trial date. On March
21, 2024, the current trial date of May 28, 2024 was set. However, again, there
is no order stating that the discovery cutoff date was continued. In addition,
this motion is being heard only seven days before this current trial date and
would even be considered untimely had the discovery cutoff date been ordered to
track with the current trial date.
 
            The Court again admonishes Defendant for asserting the
very same motions which were previously denied on numerous occasions. The Court
has the power to impose sanctions upon the Court’s own motion. Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 2.30(b). 
                In addition, the Court reminds the parties of one
definition of “vexatious litigant” as follows: 
            “As used in this title, the
following terms have the following meanings:
            (a) “Litigation” means any civil action or proceeding, commenced,
maintained or pending in any state or federal court.
            (b) “Vexatious litigant” means a person who does any of
the following:
            (3) In any litigation while acting in propria persona,
repeatedly files unmeritorious motions, pleadings, or other papers, conducts
unnecessary discovery, or engages in other tactics that are frivolous or solely
intended to cause unnecessary delay.” Code Civ. Proc., § 391.
 
            For the foregoing reasons, Defendant’s Motions for
Terminating Sanctions are denied.  
 
            Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
