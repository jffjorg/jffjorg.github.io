Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Lyft, Inc.'s motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings in the case of Johnna Lisa Ferguson v. Lyft, Inc. The plaintiff, Johnna Lisa Ferguson, was involved in a motor vehicle accident with a Lyft driver while operating a vehicle pursuant to the Lyft platform. Lyft, Inc. moves to compel arbitration and stay this action based on an arbitration agreement between the parties. The agreement states that disputes will be resolved through arbitration rather than litigation. The court finds that the moving party met its initial burden to show the existence of a valid arbitration clause between the parties, and the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that the arbitration clause should not be enforced. Since the plaintiff did not file a written opposition to the motion, the court grants the motion and orders the defendant to give notice of the ruling.
