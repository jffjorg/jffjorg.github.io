Inglewood
Montessori, LLC’s Demurrer to Complaint 
 
 
TENTATIVE RULING

Inglewood Montessori, LLC’s Demurrer to Complaint is
sustained with 20 days leave to amend. 
 
Background
 
Plaintiff’s Complaint was filed on October 6, 2023.
The Court notes that, in the caption to the Complaint, Plaintiff set forth
numerous words and phrases, some of which may constitute remedies, but the only
recognized cause of action that was stated was “negligence.” Plaintiff alleges
the following in the Complaint. On several occasions, the Plaintiff’s son Ngue
Mikailou was injured at Inglewood Montessori Preschool.  
 
            Meet and Confer
             
            Defendant set forth a meet and
confer declaration in sufficient compliance with CCP § 430.41. (Decl., Rochelle
M. McKenzie, ¶¶ 2-4.) 
 
            Demurrer

A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a
complaint as a matter of law and raises only questions of law. (Schmidt v.
Foundation Health (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706.)  In testing the sufficiency of the complaint,
the court must assume the truth of (1) the properly pleaded factual
allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably inferred from those expressly
pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39
Cal.3d 311, 318.)  The Court may not
consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law.  (Moore v. Conliffe (1994) 7 Cal.App.4th
634, 638.) Because a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of a complaint, the
plaintiff must show that the complaint alleges facts sufficient to establish
every element of each cause of action.  (Rakestraw
v. California Physicians Service (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.)  Where the complaint fails to state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action, courts should sustain the demurrer.
 (C.C.P., § 430.10(e); Zelig v. County
of Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.App.4th 1112, 1126.)
Sufficient facts are the essential facts
of the case "with reasonable precision and with particularity sufficiently
specific to acquaint the defendant with the nature, source, and extent of his
cause of action.”  (Gressley v.
Williams (1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643-644.)  "Whether the plaintiff will be able to
prove the pleaded facts is irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer."  (Stevens v. Superior Court (1986) 180
Cal.App.3d 605, 609–610.)  Under Code
Civil Procedure § 430.10(f), a demurrer may also be sustained if a complaint is
“uncertain.”  Uncertainty exists where a
complaint’s factual allegations are so confusing they do not sufficiently
apprise a defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet.  (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp.
(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)
Defendant demurs to
the Complaint and the purported thirteen causes of action for failure to state
sufficient facts to state a cause of action and uncertainty. CCP § 430.10(e)(f).
As noted above, thirteen causes of action were not set forth and the only
recognized cause of action identified in the caption was negligence. In
addition, the allegations in the Complaint would only support a potential
theory of negligence under possibly a bystander theory of negligent infliction
of emotional distress or direct theory of negligence.
 
The demurrer is
sustained because Plaintiff failed to state facts sufficient to state a cause
of action and the Complaint is uncertain. The elements of negligence are the
existence of a legal duty of care, breach of that duty, causation, and
damages.  See, McIntyre v. The Colonies-Pacific, LLC (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th
664, 671. Plaintiff fails to allege facts to meet any of the elements of a
negligence cause of action. All the allegations are focused on wrongdoing directed
against Plaintiff’s son. As an aside, the allegations are conclusory with
respect to any negligent conduct directed against Plaintiff’s son. More
importantly, for the purposes of this demurrer, there are no facts to indicate
that Defendant owes the named Plaintiff a duty of care. There are no facts to
indicate how Defendant breached any purported duty of care to the named
Plaintiff. Thus, Plaintiff also fails to state facts to show how any breach of
duty caused the Plaintiff injuries. 
 
In addition,
Plaintiff has not alleged facts to state a claim based on a bystander recovery
theory. A parent can bring a negligence cause of action for emotional distress
under two general instances: (1) the “bystander” theory where a plaintiff seeks
to recover damages as a percipient witness to the injury of another; and (2)
the “direct victim” theory in which a plaintiff seeks to recover damages as a
result of a duty owed to that plaintiff. Burgess
v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.4th 1064, 1071-73. “In the absence of
physical injury or impact to the plaintiff himself, damages for emotional
distress should be recoverable only if the plaintiff: (1) is closely related to
the injury victim, (2) is present at the scene of the injury-producing event at
the time it occurs and is then aware that it is causing injury to the victim
and, (3) as a result suffers emotional distress beyond that which would be
anticipated in a disinterested witness.”  Thing v.
La Chusa (1989) 48 Cal.3d 644, 647. 
 
Plaintiff has not
alleged facts under the bystander recovery theory because Plaintiff has not
alleged facts that he was present during the injury producing event and was
then aware that it was causing injury to the victim. In addition, as mentioned
above, as to the direct victim theory, Plaintiff has not alleged facts that
would impose a duty of care upon Defendant to the named Plaintiff. 
 
Therefore, the
demurrer to the Complaint is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
 
Defendant is ordered
to give notice of this ruling.
