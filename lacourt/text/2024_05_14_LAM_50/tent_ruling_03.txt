Defendants appear to state that Arthur Bakharyan was deposed as Formula
Automotive Group’s person most knowledgeable. (Reply at p. 3:1-2.) 


[2]The Court notes
that on August 22, 2023, an answer to the SAC was filed. 


[3]Moreover,
Defendants’ notice of motion and motion do not state that Defendants move for
summary adjudication. Rather, Defendants move “for an order granting summary
judgment in favor of all Moving Parties upon Plaintiff’s Second Amended
Complaint...” (Notice of Mot. at p. 2:7-9.) But even if Defendants did move for
summary adjudication, such a motion “shall be granted only if it completely
disposes of a cause of action, an affirmative defense, a claim for damages,
or an issue of duty.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (f)(1), emphasis
added.)
