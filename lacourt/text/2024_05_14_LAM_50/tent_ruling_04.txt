Case No.:   23STCV03260     Hearing Date:   May 14, 2024     Hearing Time:   10:00 a.m.     ORDER RE:     PLAINTIFF’S    MOTION FOR ORDER PERMITTING DISCOVERY OF DEFENDANTS’ FINANCIAL INFORMATION     AND RELATED CROSS-ACTION          Plaintiff Mital  Tamoro (“Plaintiff”) moves for an order permitting discovery of certain  financial records from Defendant Quantum Corporation.  Plaintiff’s motion will be continued to a  new date as set forth below. NO HEARING WILL TAKE PLACE ON MAY 14, 2024.     Pursuant to the  Court’s power to “amend and control its process and orders so as to make them conform  to law and justice” (Code Civ. Proc., § 128, subd. (a)(8)), the Court orders  the parties in this case to participate in a meet and confer with the Court ("Informal  Discovery Conference" or IDC”). Lead or other designated counsel for the  parties with full authority are ordered to participate in person in an IDC.  After consulting with opposing counsel regarding available dates, Plaintiff must make a prompt reservation for the IDC using the  Court’s online reservation system. Plaintiff must  file Dept. 50’s one-page IDC form in the department seven days prior to the  IDC, and the responding parties may file the same form in the department  setting forth a response three days prior to the IDC.    Once Plaintiff has  confirmed an IDC date, Plaintiff must use the  Court’s online reservation system to continue the motion to a post-IDC  discovery hearing date. The parties are ordered to have with them whatever  materials are needed to make the IDC session productive and successful. Prior  to the IDC date, lead or other designated counsel for the parties, with full  authority, are to meet and confer, in person or via telephone in a further attempt to resolve as many of the issues as possible before  the IDC. (See CRC Rule 3.670, subd. (f)(2).) If the parties resolve  their discovery disputes before the IDC date, Plaintiff is ordered to take both the IDC and the motion off  calendar as soon as possible.  Plaintiff is ordered to provide notice of this Order.    DATED:  May 14, 2024                                 ________________________________ Hon.
