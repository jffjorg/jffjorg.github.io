And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling by the Judge discusses the case of Madden v. Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, in which the Plaintiff, Madden, contends that a stay of her action against Kaiser Foundation Hospitals will lead to piecemeal and protracted litigation. The Judge agrees that Madden may properly join the blood banks as parties defendant, but notes that this right does not empower Madden to avoid her duty to arbitrate any dispute with Kaiser Foundation Hospitals. The Judge also notes that the trial court is not required to stay all proceedings against defendants who are not entitled to arbitration, and that the court may, in its discretion, sever the action as to the blood banks or limit any stay to those issues subject to arbitration.
