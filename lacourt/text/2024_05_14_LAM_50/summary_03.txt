Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court notes that the defendants have filed an answer to the second amended complaint and a motion for summary judgment. The defendants do not explicitly move for summary adjudication, but even if they did, such a motion would only be granted if it completely disposes of a cause of action, an affirmative defense, a claim for damages, or an issue of duty. The court highlights that Arthur Bakharyan was deposed as the person most knowledgeable by Formula Automotive Group. The court intends to grant summary judgment in favor of the defendants if the motion is granted.
