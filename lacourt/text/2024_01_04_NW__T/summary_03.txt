(Jones v. Conoco Phillips Co.)
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court has reviewed the pleadings and has sustained the demurrer to all three causes of action (COA) brought by the plaintiff against General Motors (GM). The COA for fraud concealment and misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, and violations of Business & Professions Code ยง17200 are all sustained with leave to amend.

The court finds that the plaintiff's pleadings are insufficient to state a claim for fraud concealment and misrepresentation, as they fail to allege specific facts regarding how GM intentionally concealed or suppressed material facts. The court also finds that the pleadings are insufficient to state a claim for negligent misrepresentation, as they fail to allege specific facts regarding how GM intended the plaintiff to rely on its representations.

The court also grants the motion to strike the plaintiff's prayer for punitive damages, as fraud cannot be established with the facts as currently pleaded.

The court gives the plaintiff 20 days to amend their pleadings to cure the deficiencies.
