 Case Number:  23VECV02394    Hearing Date:   January 4, 2024    Dept:  T 23VECV02394 STATE FARM  GENERAL INSURANC... vs BUTH-NA-BODHAIGE, INC. DBA [TENTATIVE] ORDER:  Motion for Leave to Intervene is  GRANTED.  The proposed  Complaint-in-Intervention shall be filed within 15 days. Introduction  Specially appearing Proposed  Intervenor Colony Insurance Company ("Colony") moves to intervene as  insurer for defendant National Dispatch USA, Corp.  Discussion "An intervention takes place  when a nonparty, deemed an intervenor, becomes a party to an action or  proceeding between other persons by doing any of the following:(1) joining a plaintiff  in claiming what is sought by the complaint,(2) uniting with a defendant in  resisting the claims of a plaintiff, or(3)demanding anything adverse to both a plaintiff  and a defendant" (Code Civ. Pro.,§387, subd. (b)(1)-(3).) "A nonparty  shall petition the court for leave to intervene by noticed motion or exparte application.  The petition shall include a copy of the proposed complaint  in intervention or answer in intervention and  set forth the grounds upon which intervention rests."(Code Civ. Pro.,§  387, subd. (c).)  Under California law, an  insurance carrier who is not a party to an action can intervene on behalf of  its insured when the insurance carrier could be subject to a subsequent action  under Insurance Code section 11580.  (See  Reliance Ins. Co. v. Super. Ct. (2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 383, 386.)"Section  11580 provides that a judgment creditor may proceed directly against any  liability insurance covering the defendant and obtain satisfaction of the  judgment up to the amount of the policy limits. Thus, where the insurer may be  subject to a direct action under Insurance Code section 11580 by a judgment  creditor who has or will obtain a default judgment in a third-party action  against the insured, intervention is appropriate." (Id. see also Jade K.  v. Viguri(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 1459, 1468.)"'Intervention may . . . be  allowed in the insurance context, where third party claimants are involved,  when the insurer is allowed to take over in litigation if its insured is not  defending an action, to avoid harm to the insurer.'" (Western Heritage  Ins. Co. v. Super. Ct.(2011)199 Cal.App.4th 1196, 1205.) Colony asserts that it has a  direct interest in the litigation and in the liability of its insured, National  Dispatch USA, Corp., in the event of an adverse judgment. (Levine Decl.,  6.) Colony also asserts that it will suffer  irreparable harm because it could possibly be bound by a default judgment  entered against National Dispatch USA, Corp. (Id.,  9.)   Because the evidence supports  that Colony may be exposed to liability pursuant to Insurance Code § 11580 for  any judgment taken against National Dispatch USA, Corp. because default was  entered against National Dispatch USA, Corp. on November 30, 2023. Colony thus  has sufficient interest to intervene in this action to protect its interests.  The Court notes that Colony has  submitted a proposed Complaint-in-Intervention. (Levine Decl., Ex. C.)   The proposed Complaint-in-Intervention shall  be filed within 15 days.
