And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling continues the Motion to be Relieved as Counsel filed by Jonathan Vogel, Esq. (Plaintiff's Counsel) for Yuli Goldberg-Azulay (Plaintiff). The Motion seeks to relieve Plaintiff's Counsel due to the limited-scope retainer agreement and Plaintiff's failure to respond to requests for a Substitution of Counsel and acknowledgment. However, the Motion fails to comply with California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362, as it lacks proof of service, a complete proposed order, and sufficient information. Therefore, the motion is continued for Plaintiff's Counsel to correct these deficiencies, provide proper notice, and file the proof of service with the court.
