And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motions in limine filed by both parties. The ruling addresses a wide range of issues, including the admissibility of evidence, the scope of expert testimony, and the conduct of counsel and parties during the trial.

The court has granted several motions, including those to preclude reference to the status of Tarzana Medical Center, the apportionment of fault, and the introduction of certain evidence related to the decedent's personal life. The court has also granted motions to limit the scope of expert testimony and to exclude non-party witnesses from the courtroom.

The court has denied one motion, to limit expert witness testimony to opinions expressed at deposition, and has reserved decision on another, regarding the admissibility of testimony regarding the decedent's character.

The court has also issued several general orders, including that counsel are not to call persons by their first names at trial, that jurors will be referred to by their seat number and not by name, and that everyone must stay away from jurors and not record or discuss the case in the courthouse.
