And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case brought by Pacific Aviation Development LLC against Arash "Alex" Abbassi and other defendants. The case involves a breach of lease and breach of guaranty. The Judge has granted the defendants' request for judicial notice of certain documents and has sustained some of their objections to the plaintiff's evidence. The Judge has also ruled that the plaintiff's application for a writ of attachment must be continued due to the lack of sufficient evidence to establish the amount owed by the defendants. The Judge has noted that the declarations provided by the plaintiff's representative, Steve Argubright, do not provide a sufficient foundation for his personal knowledge and have discrepancies. The Judge has also ruled that the late fees sought by the plaintiff are not ascertainable at this time due to the City of Los Angeles' COVID Moratorium, which prohibits late fees on commercial tenancies.
