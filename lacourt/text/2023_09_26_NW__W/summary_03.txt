The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case brought by Pacific Aviation Development LLC against Arash "Alex" Abbassi and other defendants. The case involves a breach of lease and breach of guaranty. The Judge has granted the defendants' request for judicial notice of certain documents and has sustained some of their objections to the plaintiff's evidence. The Judge has also ruled that the plaintiff's application for a writ of attachment must be continued due to the lack of sufficient evidence to establish the amount owed by the defendants. The Judge has noted that the declarations provided by the plaintiff's representative, Steve Argubright, do not provide a sufficient foundation for his personal knowledge and have discrepancies. The Judge has also ruled that the late fees sought by the plaintiff are not ascertainable at this time due to the City of Los Angeles' COVID Moratorium, which prohibits late fees on commercial tenancies.

As a result, the hearing on the Writ of Attachment is continued to allow Plaintiff to provide a more complete and accurate declaration.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff's writ of attachment is continued. The plaintiff is seeking to attach the defendant's property to secure payment of outstanding rent and fees. The judge has granted the defendant's request for judicial notice of certain documents. The judge has also sustained the defendant's objections to the plaintiff's evidence.

The judge is continuing the hearing to allow the plaintiff to provide a proper declaration regarding the amount of rent and fees owed by the defendants. The judge has determined that the declaration provided by the plaintiff's witness, Steve Argubright, is insufficient and does not provide a proper foundation for the claims.

The judge has also ruled that the writ of attachment cannot include illegal late fees, as the City of Los Angeles COVID Moratorium prohibits the charging of late fees on commercial tenancies. The judge has instructed the plaintiff to provide a revised declaration that excludes these late fees.

The hearing has been continued to allow the plaintiff to provide a proper declaration and to give the parties an opportunity to resolve the disputes regarding the amount of rent and fees owed.
