The case involves a breach of lease and breach of guaranty.

The Judge has also ruled that the late fees sought by the plaintiff are not ascertainable at this time due to the City of Los Angeles' COVID Moratorium, which prohibits late fees on commercial tenancies.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff's writ of attachment is continued. The plaintiff is seeking to attach the defendant's property to secure payment of outstanding rent and fees. The judge has granted the defendant's request for judicial notice of certain documents. The judge has also sustained the defendant's objections to the plaintiff's evidence.

The judge is continuing the hearing to allow the plaintiff to provide a proper declaration regarding the amount of rent and fees owed by the defendants. The judge has determined that the declaration provided by the plaintiff's witness, Steve Argubright, is insufficient and does not provide a proper foundation for the claims.

The judge has also ruled that the writ of attachment cannot include illegal late fees, as the City of Los Angeles COVID Moratorium prohibits the charging of late fees on commercial tenancies. The judge has instructed the plaintiff to provide a revised declaration that excludes these late fees.

The hearing has been continued to allow the plaintiff to provide a proper declaration and to give the parties an opportunity to resolve the disputes regarding the amount of rent and fees owed.

### Case Number and Details
Case Number: 23VECV01951
Hearing Date: September 26, 2023
Department: W PACIFIC
Plaintiff: Pacific Aviation Development LLC
Defendant: Arash "Alex" Abbassi, et al.

### Background
The plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendants for breach of lease and breach of guaranty. The plaintiff is the master tenant under a lease with the City of Los Angeles for a 30-acre property at the Van Nuys Airport. The plaintiff alleges that it and Encore entered into a tie-down agreement and a sublease for hangar space and office space, and that Defendant Abbassi provided a personal guaranty.

### Tentative Ruling
The judge continues the plaintiff's Writ of Attachment.

### Request for Judicial Notice
The defendants requested the court take judicial notice of three documents: the complaint filed in Pacific Aviation Development LLC v. Encore Flight Corp., the complaint filed in Pacific Aviation Development LLC v. Elevate Flight Academy Inc., and the Los Angeles Eviction Moratorium. The court grants the request.

### Evidentiary Objections
The defendants' objections 1-14 are sustained for lack of foundation.

### Discussion
The plaintiff requests the court grant its application and issue a Right to Attach Order and a Writ of Attachment against Defendant Abbassi. The plaintiff argues that the amount owed is readily ascertainable based on the terms of the subleases and invoices. The defendant argues that the amount is not ascertainable because the declaration of Steve Argubright does not provide a proper foundation for his statements.

### Ruling
The court agrees that the declaration does not provide a proper foundation for the statements made by Mr. Argubright. However, the court notes that the declaration does provide a readily ascertainable amount, which includes $105,635.00 for the Delta 3 sublease and $39,944.75 in outstanding rent due. The court also notes that the plaintiff is not entitled to seek late fees, interest, or attorney's fees in the writ of attachment. The court continues the hearing so that the plaintiff may provide a proper declaration.

### Significant Statements

* The amount owed is readily ascertainable based on the terms of the subleases and invoices.
* The declaration of Steve Argubright does not provide a proper foundation for his statements.
* The late fees are not ascertainable at this time because they are prohibited by the City of Los Angeles COVID Moratorium.
* The plaintiff is not entitled to seek late fees, interest, or attorney's fees in the writ of attachment.
