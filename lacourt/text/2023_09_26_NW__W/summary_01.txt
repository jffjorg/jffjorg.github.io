---

Judge Debra B. Silbert filed a complaint for negligence against Tarzana Medical Center, LLC, Providence Health System – Southern California, and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, alleging that while admitted to Tarzana Medical Center, she suffered from a preventable fall. Plaintiff alleges that Tarzana Medical Center was aware of Plaintiff’s fall risk assessment, which indicated her fall risk score was 100, yet Plaintiff was found on the ground in the hallway outside her room at Tarzana. Plaintiff further alleges that Tarzana Medical Center concealed the incident from the California Department of Public Health and did not report the incident despite its obligation to do so. Providence Health System – Southern California was dismissed on April 7, 2023.

Plaintiff Debra B. Silbert moved for an order granting a trial preference on the grounds that she is over 70 years of age with an unstable health condition, who has a substantial interest in the action as a whole, thereby necessitating a preferential trial setting to prevent prejudicing Plaintiff’s interest in the litigation. The court found that Plaintiff has made an adequate showing that she has a substantial interest in the action as a whole and her health is such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing the party's interest in the litigation. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion for trial preference is granted.
