And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Debra B. Silbert, has issued a tentative ruling granting the Plaintiff's motion for trial preference. The Plaintiff, also named Debra B. Silbert, is seeking a trial preference due to her age (73 years old) and health condition, which makes it necessary to prevent prejudicing her interest in the litigation. The Plaintiff alleges that she suffered a preventable fall at Tarzana Medical Center, LLC, and has undergone multiple medical procedures as a result. The court finds that the Plaintiff has made an adequate showing that she has a substantial interest in the action as a whole and her health is such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing her interest in the litigation. The motion is unopposed, and therefore, the Plaintiff's motion for trial preference is granted.
