Department:              W                                                        Case
No.: 23VECV01461
 
Moving Party:             Defendant Victor Cobar
Responding Party:     Plaintiff
13630 Victory Boulevard, LLC
 
BACKGROUND
 
This is a breach of contract action. Plaintiff
13630 Victory Boulevard, LLC alleges Plaintiff, as landlord, and Defendant, as
tenant, entered into a written lease agreement dated August 14, 2020 wherein
Defendant agreed to lease the Premises for a term ending on October 31, 2023. Plaintiff
alleges under the Lease, Defendant was required to pay base rent and additional
rent monthly, all as more particularly set forth in the Lease. Plaintiff
alleges Defendant vacated the Premises and returned possession of the Premises
to Plaintiff on January 17, 2021. At that time, Defendant owed base rent and
additional rent of approximately $85,000.00. 
 
On April 3, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
complaint against Defendant for breach of lease and common count. 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Defendant Victor Cobar’s Demurrer to
the Complaint is OVERRULED. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Defendant
Victor Cobar demurs to the complaint on the grounds the complaint fails to
allege whether the contract is written, oral, or implied in conduct as well as
fails to allege the essential terms of the alleged contract or contracts.
Defendant also demurs to the complaint on the grounds “[w]hen a common count is
used as an alternative way of seeking the same recovery demanded in a specific
cause of action, and is based on the same facts, the common count is demurrable
if the cause of action is demurrable.” (McBride v. Boughton (2004) 123
Cal.App.4th 379, 394.)
 
“The standard elements of a claim for breach of
contract are: ‘(1) the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for
nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4) damage to plaintiff
therefrom.’” (Wall Street Network, Ltd. v. New York Times Co. (2008) 164
Cal.App.4th 1171, 1178.) “A written contract may be pleaded by its
terms—set out verbatim in the complaint or a copy of the contract attached to
the complaint and incorporated therein by reference—or by its legal effect.” (McKell
v. Washington Mutual, Inc. (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1457, 1489.) “In order to
plead a contract by its legal effect, plaintiff must allege the substance of
its relevant terms.” (Id.) When an action is founded upon a
contract, the complaint is subject to demurrer if it cannot be ascertained
from the pleading whether the contract is written, is oral, or is implied by
conduct. (CCP § 430.10(g); Maxwell v. Dolezal (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th
93.)
 
The court finds the complaint sufficiently alleges
the parties entered into a written agreement. (Compl. ¶6.)  Moreover, Plaintiff has attached a copy of the
agreement as an exhibit. (Compl., Exh. A.) The court notes Defendant also
failed to file a meet and confer declaration. Section 430.41(a) requires a
demurring party to “meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party
who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of
determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer. . . .  As part of the meet and
confer process, the demurring party shall identify all of the specific causes
of action that it believes are subject to demurrer and identify with legal
support the basis of the deficiencies.” 
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s demurrer to the complaint
is OVERRULED.
