Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled on the defendant's demurrer to the complaint, finding it to be without merit. The defendant had argued that the complaint failed to adequately allege the terms of the contract, including whether it was written, oral, or implied in conduct. The judge found, however, that the complaint does sufficiently allege the parties entered into a written agreement, and has attached a copy of the agreement as an exhibit. Additionally, the defendant failed to file a meet and confer declaration, as required by statute. As a result, the judge has overruled the defendant's demurrer to the complaint.

## English Summary

The judge has decided to reject the defendant's request to dismiss the lawsuit.

The defendant argued that the complaint didn't clearly state the type of contract involved (written, oral, or implied) and didn't provide enough detail about the contract's terms. The judge disagreed, stating that the complaint clearly mentions a written agreement and includes a copy of the agreement as an exhibit. Additionally, the judge pointed out that the defendant didn't follow the proper procedure for raising these objections by failing to meet and confer with the plaintiff before filing the demurrer. 

Therefore, the case will proceed.
