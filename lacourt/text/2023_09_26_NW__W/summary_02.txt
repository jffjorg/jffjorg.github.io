Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled on the defendant's demurrer to the complaint, finding it to be without merit. The defendant had argued that the complaint failed to adequately allege the terms of the contract, including whether it was written, oral, or implied in conduct. The judge found, however, that the complaint does sufficiently allege the parties entered into a written agreement, and has attached a copy of the agreement as an exhibit. Additionally, the defendant failed to file a meet and confer declaration, as required by statute. As a result, the judge has overruled the defendant's demurrer to the complaint.
