And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants, Steven and Jessica Hargrove, and has denied both. The defendants argued that the plaintiff's complaint fails to state a cause of action for breach of lease because the lease is void, and that the damages sought are not specified in the prayer. The judge found that the complaint does allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action, despite the lack of specificity in the prayer, and that the damages sought are sufficiently alleged elsewhere in the complaint.

The defendants also sought to strike certain portions of the complaint, including the request for attorney fees and the allegation of compensatory and consequential damages. The judge found that the request for attorney fees is proper under the parties' lease agreement, and that the damages alleged are sufficient to support the claim.

The court has overruled the defendants' demurrer and motion to strike, and has ordered the defendants to file and serve their answer within 20 days.
