  Case Number:  23STCV27404    Hearing Date:   March 15, 2024    Dept:  74 Living the
Dream v. Steven Hargrove, et al.
Defendants’ Demurrer to Complaint
BACKGROUND 
            This
action arises from a contractual dispute.
            On
November 8, 2023, Plaintiff Living the Dream (Plaintiff) filed a complaint
against Steven and Jessica Hargrove. The complaint alleges one cause of action
for breach of written lease.
            On
December 8, 2023, Steven Hargrove filed this demurrer.
            On
January 5, 2024, Jessica Hargrove filed a joinder to the demurrer. 
LEGAL STANDARD
            A
demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable. (¿¿Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318¿¿.) “¿To
survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a
cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the
plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.¿” (¿¿C.A. v. William S. Hart Union
High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872¿¿.) For the purpose of testing
the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer
admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded. (¿Aubry v. Tri-City
Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967¿.) A demurrer “¿does not
admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.¿” (¿¿Daar v.
Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713¿¿.) DISCUSSION 
            Defendants Steven and Jessica Hargrove (Defendants) argue
Plaintiff’s cause of action for breach of lease fails because the lease is
void. In support, Defendants rely on documents for which they seek judicial
notice. Because the court denies Defendants’ request for judicial notice,
Defendants’ demurrer for this cause of action is overruled. Defendants also
contend the complaint is defective because the damages sought are not specified
in the prayer. Elsewhere in the complaint, though, Plaintiff alleges the amount
of damages it has suffered. (Complaint, ¶ 19; See Becker v. S.P.V.
Construction Co. (1980) 27 Cal.3d 489, 494.) 
CONCLUSION 
The
court overrules Defendants’ demurrer.
Defendants
shall file and serve their answer within 20 days.
Defendants
shall give notice.Living the Dream v. Steven Hargrove,

Defendants’ Motion to Strike
Portions of the Complaint
The court considered the moving
papers, opposition, and reply.
BACKGROUND
            This
action arises from a contractual dispute.
            On
November 8, 2023, Plaintiff Living Dream (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against
Steven and Jessica Hargrove. The complaint alleges one cause of action for
breach of written lease.
            On December 8, 2023, Steven Hargrove
filed this motion to strike portions of the complaint.
            On
January 5, 2024, Jessica Hargrove filed a joinder to the motion to strike.
LEGAL STANDARD
            A court may strike any “¿irrelevant,
false or improper matter¿inserted in any pleading¿” or any part of a pleading
“¿not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule,
or an order of the court.¿” (¿Code Civ. Proc., § 436¿.) “¿The grounds for a
motion to strike shall appear on the face of the challenged pleading or from
any matter of which the court is required to take judicial notice.¿” (¿Code
Civ. Proc., § 437¿.)¿            
DISCUSSION  
            Defendants
Steven and Jessica Hargrove (Defendants) seek to strike the following portions
of Plaintiff’s complaint: page 4, lines 18-19; page 4, line 20; and page 4,
line 22. According to Defendants, Plaintiff’s complaint fails to specify
compensatory and consequential damages sought in the prayer. Elsewhere in the complaint, though, Plaintiff alleges the
amount of damages it has suffered. (Complaint, ¶ 19; See Becker v. S.P.V.
Construction Co. (1980) 27 Cal.3d 489, 494.) Defendants also contend
Plaintiff’s request for attorney fees is improper. Attorney fees are
recoverable if a statute or agreement so provides. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1021.)
In the complaint, Plaintiff seeks attorney fees under the parties’ lease
agreement. (Complaint, ¶ 14.) Defendants contend Plaintiff is not entitled to
attorney fees because Plaintiff has not alleged compliance with the agreement
such that attorney fees are permitted. Whether Plaintiff complied with the
attorney fees provision in the lease cannot be resolved at this stage in the
pleadings, though. 
CONCLUSION 
            The
court overrules Defendants’ motion to strike.
            Defendants
shall give notice.
