And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is a response to the plaintiff's motion to compel responses to requests for production and to compel the deposition of Defendant Sirimanne. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant failed to repay a $5 million balance and is seeking to compel responses to requests for production and to depose Defendant Sirimanne.

The court finds that the plaintiff is entitled to an order compelling responses to the requests for production and orders the defendant to provide verified, code-compliant responses without objections within 20 days of the order. The court also grants the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of Defendant Sirimanne and orders him to sit for deposition at a time and place of the plaintiff's choosing within 10 days of the order.

Additionally, the court grants the plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $1,050, which the defendant is required to pay within 30 days of the order. The court finds that the defendant's failure to appear for deposition and his opposition to the discovery motions were unjustified and warrants sanctions.
