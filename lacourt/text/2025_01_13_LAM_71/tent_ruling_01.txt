Background
On
January 9, 2024, Marta Arredondo, Javier Perez, Javier Mateo Perez, a minor, by
and through his Guardian Ad Litem, Javier Perez, and Jose Adrian Perez, a
minor, by and through his Guardian Ad Litem, Javier Perez (collectively,

R&E Management, Inc. (“Defendants”) for uninhabitable conditions at
Plaintiffs’ apartment, alleging 1) Breach of Warranty of Habitability; 2) Breach

Legal
Standard
“A
parent having the right to compromise the disputed claim of the minor under
this section may execute a full release and satisfaction, or execute a covenant
not to sue on or a covenant not to enforce judgment on the disputed claim,
after the money or other property to be paid or delivered has been paid or
delivered as provided in subdivision (c). If the court orders that all or any
part of the money to be paid under the compromise or covenant be deposited in
an insured account in a financial institution in this state, or in a
single-premium deferred annuity, the release and satisfaction or covenant is
not effective for any purpose until the money has been deposited as directed in
the order of the court.” (Prob. Code, § 3500(d).) 
“The
court shall schedule a hearing on a petition for compromise of a minor’s
disputed claim pursuant to Section 3500 within 30 days from the date of filing.
If the petition is unopposed, the court shall issue a decision on the petition
at the conclusion of the hearing.” (Prob. Code, § 3505.) 
“The
court making the order or giving the judgment referred to in Section 3600, as a
part thereof, shall make a further order authorizing and directing that
reasonable expenses, medical or otherwise and including reimbursement to a
parent, guardian, or conservator, costs, and attorney’s fees, as the court
shall approve and allow therein, shall be paid from the money or other property
to be paid or delivered for the benefit of the minor or person with a
disability.” (Prob. Code, § 3601(a).)
 
Discussion
Claimant
Javier Mateo Perez (“Claimant”), a minor, by and through his Guardian Ad Litem,
Javier Perez (“Petitioner”), has agreed to settle his claims against Defendant
335 S. Witmer LLC in exchange for $5,000.00. (Petition, ¶ 10.) If approved, $1,250.00
will be used for attorney’s fees and $190.28 for costs in filing and service
fees, leaving a balance of $3,559.72 for Claimant. (Id., ¶ 16.) Claimant
does not claim medical expenses. (Id.) 
The Court finds the petition is properly
approved. Defendant 335 S. Witmer LLC has agreed to pay Claimant a gross
settlement of $3,559.72. The Court finds this settlement to be fair and
reasonable considering the adult plaintiffs were allocated $47,500 each for
incurring the majority of the special damages in the form of rent paid during
the unhabitable period and property damage. (Petition, Attachment 11b(3).)
Further, Claimant has recovered completely from any injuries, has no permanent
injuries, and incurred no medical expenses in connection with this action.
(Petition, ¶¶ 8, 12.)
$1,250,
or 25%, of the gross settlement is to pay for attorney’s fees. (Petition,
Fishenfeld Decl., ¶¶ 4-7.) The Court finds this to be reasonable considering Claimant’s
counsel investigated liability, gathered records, and engaged in settlement
discussions. Claimant’s attorney expects to receive attorney’s fees in addition
to that requested in this petition in the amount of $39,250 from 335 S. Witmer
LLC upon approval of this petition. (Petition, ¶ 17(f).)
Petitioner
requests the balance of $3,559.72 to be
paid or delivered to the Petitioner Javier Perez, the parent of the minor
Claimant, at 335 S. Witmer St., Apt. 10 Los Angeles, CA 90017, upon the terms
and under the conditions specified in Probate Code sections 3401-3402, without
bond. (Petition, ¶ 18, Attachment
18b(5).) In compliance
with Probate Code § 3401, the total estate of the minor does not exceed $5,000.
(Perez Decl., ¶ 3.)  
The Petition was served onto
Defendants on October 15, 2024 and is unopposed. 
All
required attachments have been filed. 
The petition is properly approved.
 
Conclusion
Petitioner Javier Perez’s petition for approval of minor’s
compromise for Claimant Javier Mateo Perez is approved, pending
Mr. Perez’s appearance at the hearing of this petition.  (Given his age (11), Javier Mateo Perez is
excused from attending.)
