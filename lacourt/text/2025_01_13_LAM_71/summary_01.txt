The Judge's tentative ruling approves the petition for approval of minor's compromise for Claimant Javier Mateo Perez and Claimant Jose Adrian Perez. The petition was filed by Javier Perez, the parent and Guardian Ad Litem of the minors, and is unopposed. The settlement agreement provides for a gross settlement of $3,559.72 to be paid to each Claimant, with $1,250.00 to be used for attorney's fees and $190.28 for costs in filing and service fees.

The Judge also finds that Claimant has recovered completely from any injuries and incurred no medical expenses in connection with this action. The petition is approved pending the appearance of Javier Perez at the hearing.
