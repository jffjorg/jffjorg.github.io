And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication on all four causes of action (pregnancy discrimination, disability discrimination, failure to accommodate, and denial of CFRA rights). The judge found that the plaintiff had not met her burden of proving each element of her causes of action, and that there were triable issues of material fact. Specifically, the judge found that the plaintiff had not shown that she was entitled to CFRA leave, and that the defendant had raised a triable issue of material fact as to whether it had engaged in an interactive process with the plaintiff to determine reasonable accommodations. The judge also denied the plaintiff's request for summary adjudication on the fourth cause of action (failure to engage in the interactive process) because the plaintiff had failed to demonstrate that she had made a request for reasonable accommodation.
