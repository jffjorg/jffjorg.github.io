And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Erewhon's motion for leave to file a third amended cross-complaint. The motion is opposed by SL Retail. The judge has determined that California Rules of Court, Rule 2.551 does not apply in this case, as Erewhon does not provide evidence that the subject exhibits are subject to a confidentiality agreement or protective order. Instead, the judge has ordered that the hearing on the motion be continued to a later date, and that Erewhon must either file a motion or application to seal the subject exhibits if they seek to do so, or file unredacted versions of the documents with the Court if they do not seek to seal them.
