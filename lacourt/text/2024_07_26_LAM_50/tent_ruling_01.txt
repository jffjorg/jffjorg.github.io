[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:
MOTIONS TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL 




AND RELATED CROSS-ACTION


 



 
Gregory K. Sabo of
Chapman Glucksman (“Counsel”) moves to be relieved as
counsel for Defendants Gloria Martinez-Senftner and Martinez Law Group,
P.C. 
The Court finds that Counsel has
complied with the relevant procedural requirements (CRC 3.1362) and has
provided sufficient reason for withdrawal. Accordingly, the motions to be
relieved as counsel will be granted.¿ 
The Court notes that on July 15,
2024, after the instant motions were filed, the Court issued a minute order
providing, inter alia, that “[p]ursuant to written
stipulation, the Hearing on Application for Order for Appearance and
Examination scheduled for 07/16/2024 is continued to 09/16/24 at 10:00 AM in
Department 50 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse.” Thus, the Court will change
the date listed in Items 7(a) of the proposed orders (Forms MC-053) from
7/16/24 to 9/16/24. 
Counsel is ordered to give notice of this
order.¿
