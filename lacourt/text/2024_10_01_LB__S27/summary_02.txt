And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the motions for summary judgment filed by both parties and has issued a tentative ruling. The ruling states that Legacy is entitled to an award of damages against Landstar in the amount of $560,222.03, which includes the amount settled with the goods' owner and the towing and recovery charges. Landstar is entitled to damages against Legacy in the amount of $254,211.98 for the transportation services provided.

The judge has also ruled that the $150,000 limitation of liability clause in the parties' contract does not apply because Landstar did not have the goods in its care, custody, and control at the time of the accident. Additionally, the judge has determined that the parties' contract provision allowing for recovery of incidental expenses applies to the towing and recovery charges.

The judge has also granted Legacy's motion for off-set, which means that Landstar will not be awarded damages on its cross-complaint. The parties are ordered to meet and confer on issues relating to prejudgment interest and/or attorneys' fees and submit a proposed judgment for processing.

The tentative ruling will be considered at the hearing on October 1, 2024.
