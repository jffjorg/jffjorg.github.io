And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Damion Timmons v. Right Angle Solutions, Inc. The case involves a breach of contract and fraud claims filed by Timmons against Right Angle Solutions and its employee, Duane Cook. On June 4, 2024, the defendants filed a motion to vacate the default judgment entered against them on January 11, 2022. The defendants argue that the proof of service was invalid because the facility where the service was attempted was closed due to COVID-19. The plaintiff filed an untimely opposition to the motion, citing a rebuttable presumption that the proof of service is valid. However, the Judge finds that the defendants have rebutted the presumption and met their burden to prove the lack of valid service. The Judge grants the motion to vacate the default judgment and orders the defendants to file a separate copy of their answer to the complaint within five days. A case management conference and trial setting conference is scheduled for October 31, 2024.
