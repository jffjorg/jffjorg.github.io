```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for reconsideration and motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. The motion for reconsideration is denied because the plaintiff failed to show that the terms of his revocable family trust instrument are a new or different fact, circumstance, or law that supports reconsideration. The plaintiff also failed to provide a satisfactory explanation for not presenting this information at the first hearing. The motion for leave to file a second amended complaint is also denied because the plaintiff failed to show how the proposed amended complaint would cure the defects in the previously filed amended complaint. The judge will sign a proposed judgment submitted by the defendant at the conclusion of the hearing.
