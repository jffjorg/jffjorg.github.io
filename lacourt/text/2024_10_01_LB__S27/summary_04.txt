And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling regarding the motion to quash filed by Damon Scott Stansbury, the plaintiff, against Harborlight Landing, LLC, et al., the defendants. The motion was continued twice previously to allow the plaintiff to conduct jurisdictional discovery. However, the plaintiff failed to file a supplemental opposition in response to the latest continuance. The court presumes that the plaintiff has conceded that he lacks sufficient evidence to establish jurisdiction over the defendants and has granted the motion to quash. The parties are reminded that there is a Case Management Conference and Order to Show Cause re: Failure to Appear by Hilton scheduled for today, which will be held concurrently with the hearing on the motion to quash. Counsel is asked to make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing.
