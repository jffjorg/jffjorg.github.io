 Case Number:  23LBCV02017    Hearing Date:   October 1, 2024    Dept:  S27 1.     Background
Facts
Plaintiff, Damon Scott Stansbury
filed this action against Defendants, Harborlight Landing, LLC, et al. for
damages arising out of an incident that occurred on 1109/22.  Specifically, Plaintiff alleges Defendant,
Anders Stefan Thene, assaulted and battered him at a marina owned, operated,
managed, controlled, and/or otherwise occupied by the remaining
defendants.  
 
2.     Motion
to Quash
The Court has twice previously continued the hearing on this motion to
permit Plaintiff to conduct jurisdictional discovery.  The Court ordered the parties to file
supplemental opposition and supplemental reply papers per Code.  
Plaintiff has not filed any
supplemental opposition in connection with the most recent continuance of the
hearing.  The Court presumes this is
because Plaintiff concedes he lacks sufficient evidence to establish jurisdiction
over Defendants, and grants the motion to quash.  
 
3.     CMC
and OSC
The parties are reminded that there
is a Case Management Conference and OSC re: Failure to Appear by Hilton on
calendar today concurrently with the hearing on the motion to quash.  The Court asks Counsel to make arrangements
to appear remotely at the hearing on the motion, CMC, and OSC.
