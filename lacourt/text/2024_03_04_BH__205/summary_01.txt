And here is a summary in English text:

The judge issued a tentative ruling on a motion for attorneys' fees in the amount of $115,720. The motion was filed by the defendants, who argued that the plaintiff's denials of certain requests for admission (RFAs) were unreasonable. The plaintiff, Leigh Collier, alleged that the defendants breached an oral contract or partnership agreement to form a new media production company. The court previously granted summary adjudication as to certain causes of action, including the plaintiff's claims for fraud and breach of confidence.

The court found that the plaintiff's denials of the RFAs were unreasonable as to the existence of an oral partnership agreement with certain defendants, but not as to the existence of an agreement with another defendant. The court awarded the defendants $15,372 in attorneys' fees, which is 90% of the requested amount. The court also found that the hourly rates of the attorneys, $600 per hour, were reasonable and within the range of prevailing market rates in Los Angeles.
