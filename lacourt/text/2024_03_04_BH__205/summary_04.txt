And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for default judgment against the defendant, Jose Matia Maranon dba J&J General Contractors. The plaintiff, VZ Construction Company, had filed a complaint alleging breach of written contract, conversion, constructive trust, and declaratory relief, and sought damages, interest, costs, and attorneys' fees. The defendant failed to respond to the complaint, and the plaintiff successfully requested entry of default. However, the plaintiff's request for default judgment was denied because the proposed judgment sought an amount of damages ($28,000) that exceeds the amount demanded in the complaint ($21,000), which is contrary to California law. The judge noted that the plaintiff had failed to complete the required form (CIV-100) seeking court judgment and that the proposed judgment would be void if the court awards default judgment in an amount greater than that demanded in the complaint. The case will proceed to a hearing on March 4, 2024.
