English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Pacific Employers Insurance Company's motion to file confidential records under seal. The motion seeks to protect confidential financial information in a settlement agreement between Pacific and other parties. The judge has granted the motion, finding that there is an overriding interest in protecting personal financial information and confidential settlement agreements. The judge has determined that the parties' privacy interests outweigh the public's right of access to the settlement agreement, and that the sealing order is properly tailored to seal only the document that reveals the confidential information. The judge has ordered the settlement agreement to be filed under seal for purposes of this filing only and without prejudice to any party's future motion to unseal.
