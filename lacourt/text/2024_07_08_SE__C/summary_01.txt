And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the second cause of action for open book account is without merit. The plaintiff has alleged that a book account arose out of a contract and fiduciary duty between the parties, and that the defendant failed to pay rent as required by the lease agreement. The judge has found that the operative Second Amended Complaint satisfies the elements of a cause of action for open book account, and that the defendant's argument that a cause of action for open book account cannot be based upon breach of a written lease agreement is without merit. Therefore, the judge has overruled the defendant's demurrer and ordered the defendant to answer the complaint within 10 days, with notice to the plaintiff.
