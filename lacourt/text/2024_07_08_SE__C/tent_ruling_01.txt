Defendant
A&A Fabrication and Polishing Corp.’s Demurrer is OVERRULED.  Defendant to answer in 10 days.
 
Plaintiff
to give Notice. 
 
 
The
operative Second Amended Complaint (SAC) filed on February 21, 2024 alleges
that on or about June 23, 2014, Plaintiff Whittier CityCenter and Defendants A&A
Fabrication and Polishing Corp. and Alfred Henderson entered into a three year
lease for the commercial property located at 12031 Philadelphia St., Building
#2, Whittier, CA 90601 (“Premises”). (¶¶1, 6.) After several rent increases,
Defendants started to miss and/or underpay their rent payments, and by August
8, 2022, they stopped paying rent all together. (¶10.) Defendants have since
vacated the premises. (¶11.) Based thereon, Plaintiff brings causes of action
for: 1) Breach of Contract and 2) Open Book Account.
 
Defendant
A&A Fabrication and Polishing Corp. demurs to the second cause of action
for open book account on the grounds that it fails to allege facts sufficient
to constitute a cause of action.
 
The
following elements establish the existence of a book account: (1) detailed
statement that is the principal record of one or more transactions between the
debtor and creditor; (2) arises out of a contract or fiduciary duty; (3) shows
the debts and credits against whom and in favor of whom; (4) is entered in the
regular course of business; (6) is kept in a reasonably permanent form or
manner; and (7) is on a sheet of sheets fastened in a book or is kept in any
other reasonably permanent form and manner. (CCP §337a.) To state a cause of
action for an open book account, Plaintiff must establish: “(1) the statement
of indebtedness in a certain sum, (2) the consideration… and (3) nonpayment.” (Farmers
Ins. Exchange v. Zerin (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 445, 460.) “A book account may
furnish the basis for an action on a common count when it contains a statement
of the debits and credits of the transactions involved completely enough to
supply evidence from which it can be reasonably determined what amount is due
to the claimant. [Citations.] A book account is described as ‘open’ when the
debtor has made some payment on the account, leaving a balance due.” (Interstate
Group Administrators, Inc. v. Cravens, Dargan & Co. (1985) 174
Cal.App.3d 700, 708.) A book account is a detailed statement of debits and
credits on an account from which it can be reasonably determined what amount is
due to the claimant. [Citations.]” (Interstate Group Administrators, Inc. v.
Cravens, Dargan & Co. (1985) 174 Cal.App.3d 700, 708.) 
 
Defendant
argues that a cause of action for open book account cannot be based upon breach
of a written lease agreement.  This
argument is without merit.  An open book account
may arise “out of a contract or some fiduciary relation”. (CCP §337a,
italics added.) Defendant cites no authority which prevents Plaintiff from
alleging breach of contract and open book account in the operative complaint.
 
Accordingly,
Defendant’s demurrer is OVERRULED. 
Defendant to answer in 10 days.
