Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied an ex parte application by MJ Global to advance the hearing dates for the demurrer and discovery motions, and to set a trial date within 20 days. MJ Global claims it cannot afford to pay its rent to the "master landlord" due to Everytable's failure to pay rent, but the court is unclear how evicting Everytable would help MJ Global obtain the funds it needs. The court notes that Everytable has deposited the outstanding rent with the court pending a ruling on who should receive the rent. The judge concludes that MJ Global has not demonstrated irreparable harm or any other grounds for ex parte relief, and therefore the application is denied.
