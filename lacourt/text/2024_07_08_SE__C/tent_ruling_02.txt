 Case Number:  24NWCV00798    Hearing Date:   July 8, 2024    Dept:  C MJ
Global Enterprise, Inc. v. Everytable, PBC, Case No. 24NWCV00798
Defendant Everytable subleases
commercial space from Plaintiff MJ Global.  MJ Global filed this UD action
against Everytable for failure to pay rent.  Everytable filed a complaint
in interpleader in Case No. 24STCV02343 which is pending in D19 (Mosk). 
In that case, Everytable alleges that it has received competing demands for
rent from MJ Global and Apex Funding (on behalf of the property owner,
Vernon-B).  Everytable has deposited with the Court the amount of
outstanding rent pending a ruling by the court regarding who should receive the
rent (MJ Global or Apex Funding).  
On June 7, 2024, the Court
continued Everytable's demurrer and MJ Global's two discovery motions to August
1, 2024, and trial to August 2, 2024, pending a ruling by D19 on Everytable's
motion to restrain MJ Global from prosecuting this UD action.  In denying
the motion, D19 noted the two cases are not related and Everytable had not
demonstrated irreparable harm.  Currently, there is a demurrer set in D19
on July 24, 2024.  
In this ex parte application, MJ
Global renews its request to advance the hearing dates for the demurrer and
discovery motions, and it asks to set a trial date within 20 days.  MJ
Global argues that because it has not received rent from Everytable, it cannot
afford to pay its rent to the "master landlord" who is seeking to
evict all tenants.  However, it is unclear to this Court how evicting
Everytable will help MJ Global obtain the funds it needs to pay its rent, when
Evertable's rent has been deposited with the court in connection with its
Complaint in Interpleader.  Therefore, MJ Global has not demonstrated
irreparable harm or any other grounds for ex parte relief.  
Accordingly, the ex parte
application is DENIED.
