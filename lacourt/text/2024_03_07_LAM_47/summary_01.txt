And here is a summary in English text:

Judge Theresa M. Traber's tentative ruling grants Attorney Gary S. Saunders' motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiffs 7911 Oceanus, LLC and Joe G. Garcia. The motion was filed due to irreconcilable differences between the attorney and the plaintiffs. The judge finds that the risk of prejudice to the plaintiffs is low due to the distance of trial and absence of substantive motion hearings in the intervening period. The judge orders that the attorney serve written notice of this order on all parties and file proof of service with the court.
