STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action, filed on December 8, 2020, for wrongful foreclosure,
quiet title, infliction of emotional distress, and fraudulent concealment.
Plaintiffs seek to unwind a foreclosure sale which they contend was unlawful
and invalid.
 
            Attorney Gary
S. Saunders moves to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiffs 7911 Oceanus, LLC
and Joe G. Garcia. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Attorney Gary S. Saunders moves to
be relieved as counsel for Plaintiffs 7911 Oceanus, LLC and Joe G. Garcia.
 
Moving counsel filed all three required forms (MC-051,
-052, and -053) separately as to both Plaintiffs and included a proof of
service as required by California Rules of Court rule 3.1362(d).  Moving counsel’s declaration states that he served Plaintiffs
by mail and confirmed the address was current by conversation. (MC-052 ¶ 3.) 
 
In general, an attorney may withdraw with
or without cause as long as the withdrawal would not result in undue prejudice
to the client’s interest – i.e., counsel cannot withdraw at a critical point in
the litigation, because that would prejudice client, but can withdraw
otherwise. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904,
915.) The court has discretion to deny an attorney’s request to withdraw where
the withdrawal would work an injustice or cause undue delay in the proceeding,
but the court’s discretion in this area is one to be exercised reasonably. (Mandell
v. Superior Court (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 1, 4.)   
 
Here, trial in this matter is set for
August 27, 2024, at 10:00 AM. (MC-052 ¶¶ 6-7.) There is a Status Conference
regarding Alternative Dispute Resolution set for May 7, 2024, at 9:00 AM, and a
Final Status Conference set for August 12, 2024, at 9:00 AM. (Id. ¶ 5.) There
is also a hearing on a separate Motion to be Relieved as Counsel set for March
8, 2024. The risk of prejudice to Plaintiffs is therefore low due to the
distance of trial and absence of substantive motion hearings in the intervening
period. Moving Counsel’s declaration states that counsel and Plaintiffs have
experienced irreconcilable differences. (MC-052 ¶ 2.) Given the evidence of the
breakdown in the relationship and the low risk of prejudice at this juncture,
the Court finds that these circumstances warrant withdrawal.
 
Accordingly, Attorney Gary S. Saunders’s
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff 7911 Oceanus, LLC is GRANTED. 
 
Accordingly, Attorney Gary S. Saunders’s
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff Joe G. Garcia is GRANTED. 
 
            This
ruling is conditioned on Moving Counsel serving written notice of this order on
all parties and filing proof of service with the Court. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
