Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendant Hippo Insurance Services to the complaint filed by Plaintiffs Boghos Tovmassian and Marguerite Tovmassian. The Plaintiffs allege breach of insurance contract, breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and elder abuse. The Judge finds that the complaint sufficiently alleges breach of contract, breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and elder abuse. The Judge also finds that the Defendant's argument that it is not a party to the contract is unavailing and that the complaint adequately alleges that the Defendant is a party to the contract. The Judge notes that the Defendant has complied with the meet and confer requirement and that the demurrer is OVERRULED.
