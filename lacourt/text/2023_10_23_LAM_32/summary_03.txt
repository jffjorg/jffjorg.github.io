And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to compel arbitration of the plaintiff's individual PAGA claims. The ruling concludes that the defendant has proven a valid arbitration agreement and has not waived its right to arbitrate. The agreement is found to exhibit a minimal degree of unconscionability, but this is not sufficient to avoid enforcement of the agreement. The judge grants the defendant's motion to compel arbitration of the individual PAGA claims, and stays the non-individual PAGA claims pending the outcome of arbitration. The ruling notes that the mere fact that the individual claims are compelled to arbitration does not remove the plaintiff's standing to pursue the representative claims, but a stay is warranted to prevent duplicative or inconsistent findings on common issues.
