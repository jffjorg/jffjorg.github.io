And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the City of Los Angeles (Defendant) in response to the Second Amended Complaint filed by Jose De Anda (Plaintiff). The Plaintiff alleges that he was subjected to retaliation for reporting a racist remark and a threat, and seeks to establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA).

The judge has found that the Plaintiff's complaint adequately pleads equitable tolling, which suspends the statute of limitations. The judge has also found that the allegations in the Second Amended Complaint sufficiently support a prima facie case of retaliation.

The judge has denied the Defendant's motion to strike allegations from the Second Amended Complaint, finding that they are relevant to the Plaintiff's claim of retaliation. The judge has also overruled the Defendant's demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint, finding that it fails to state a cause of action.

The case will proceed to trial, where the Plaintiff will have the opportunity to prove his claims of retaliation.
