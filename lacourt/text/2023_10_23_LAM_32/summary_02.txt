And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the action. The Plaintiff, Jane Doe, filed the action against Leonard Dykstra and others on December 24, 2020, but failed to serve the lawsuit within two years. The Court dismissed the action on July 3, 2023, and the Plaintiff's counsel failed to appear at the Order to Show Cause (OSC) hearing due to a calendaring error. The Plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal is based on this error, but the Judge finds that the dismissal was still justified because of the Plaintiff's failure to serve the lawsuit. The Judge also notes that there is no proof of service indicating service on any defendant in compliance with Section 583.420. The Judge concludes that the Plaintiff's motion is denied.
