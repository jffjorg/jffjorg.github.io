JANE DOE,
                        Plaintiff,
            v.
 
LEONARD KYLE DYKSTRA, et
  al., 
                        Defendants. 


 
  Case No.:  20STCV49231
  Hearing Date:  October 23, 2023
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
Plaintiff’s motion to set aside
  dismissal




 


 



BACKGROUND
            Plaintiff Jane Doe filed this action
against Leonard Dykstra and numerous other defendants on December 24, 2020. On
July 3, 2023, the Court dismissed the action pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 583.420(a)(1). Plaintiff did not appear for the hearing on the
order to show cause. 
            On September 27, 2023, Plaintiff
filed the instant motion to set aside the dismissal on the grounds that
Plaintiff’s counsel failed to appear at the OSC due to a calendaring error. 
LEGAL STANDARD
“The court may, upon any terms as may be
just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment,
dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her
through
his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 473(b).) Section 473(b)
also provides for mandatory relief in instances of attorney mistake, “unless
the court finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the
attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.” (Ibid.) “[C]ourts
have often granted relief pursuant to the discretionary relief provision of
section 473 if no prejudice to the opposing party will ensue.” (Comunidad en
Accion v. Los Angeles City Council (2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1132-1133.)

DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff’s counsel avers that she
failed to appear at the OSC due to a calendaring mix-up with another case
involving a “Jane Doe” plaintiff. (Martinez-Senfter Decl. ¶ 2.) However, this
does not resolve the issue arising under Code of Civil Procedure section
583.420(a)(1). The case was still justifiably dismissed because Plaintiff
failed to serve the lawsuit within two years after filing it. Plaintiff does
not explain how her appearance at the OSC would have resulted in a different
outcome. To date, there is no proof of service indicating service on any
defendant in compliance with Section 583.420. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion to vacate
dismissal is DENIED.
