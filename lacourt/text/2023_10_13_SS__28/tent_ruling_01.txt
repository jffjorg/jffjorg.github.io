BACKGROUND 
On
August 26, 2019, Plaintiff Debra Gene Escano (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendants Kamnuan Thongmanee, Arporn Thongmanee, and Does 1-10 for
premises liability. 
On
September 30, 2019, Defendants Kamnuan Thongmanee and
Arporn Thongmanee (“Defendants”) filed an answer and a cross-complaint
against Cross-Defendants Shawn Michael Ellis (“Ellis”) and Roes 1-100 for
implied indemnity, express indemnity, contribution, and declaratory relief. On
February 11, 2021, Ellis filed an answer. 
On
December 16, 2020, based on the parties’ stipulation, the Court continued the
trial from February 22, 2021 to December 14, 2021 and ordered that discovery
and motion cut-off dates would trail the new trial date. 
On
September 10, 2021, based on the parties’ stipulation, the Court continued the
trial from December 14, 2021 to November 1, 2022 and ordered that discovery and motion cut-off dates would trail the new
trial date. 
On September
20, 2022, the Court granted Defendants’ ex parte application and continued the
trial from November 1, 2022, to May 4, 2023. 
The Court ruled that discovery and law and motion remained cut off except
for Ellis’s deposition. 
On
April 21, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s ex parte application in part and
continued the trial from May 4, 2023 to August 23, 2023.  The Court ruled that discovery and law and
motion remained cut off. 
On
August 9, 2023, consistent with the parties’ stipulation, the Court advanced
and vacated the trial date and set a trial setting conference on October 5,
2023.  The Court later continued the
trial setting conference to October 19, 2023 based on the parties’ stipulation. 
On
August 11, 2023, Defendants filed a motion to preclude any expert testimony on
behalf of Plaintiff to be heard on October 13, 2023. On October 2, 2023,
Plaintiff filed an opposition. On October 4, 2023, Defendants filed a reply.

LEGAL STANDARD 
“After
the setting of the initial trial date for the action, any party may obtain
discovery by demanding that all parties simultaneously exchange information
concerning each other’s expert trial witnesses” to the extent specified by Code
of Civil Procedure section 2034.210.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2034.210.)  “The party demanding an exchange of
information concerning expert trial witnesses shall serve the demand on all
parties who have appeared in the action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2034.240.) 
“The
demand shall specify the date for the exchange of lists of expert trial
witnesses, expert witness declarations, and any demanded production of
writings. The specified date of exchange shall be 50 days before the initial
trial date, or 20 days after service of the demand, whichever is closer to the
trial date, unless the court, on motion and a showing of good cause, orders an
earlier or later date of exchange.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2034.230, subd. (b).) 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2034.260 provides: 
“(a) All parties who have appeared in the action shall
exchange information concerning expert witnesses in writing on or before the
date of exchange specified in the demand. The exchange of information may occur
at a meeting of the attorneys for the parties involved or by serving the
information on the other party by any method specified in Section 1011 or 1013,
on or before the date of exchange. 
“(b) The exchange of expert witness information shall
include either of the following: 
“(1) A list setting forth the name and address of a
person whose expert opinion that party expects to offer in evidence at the
trial. 
“(2) A statement that the party does not presently
intend to offer the testimony of an expert witness. 
“(c) If a witness on the list is an expert as
described in subdivision (b) of Section 2034.210, the exchange shall also
include or be accompanied by an expert witness declaration signed only by the
attorney for the party designating the expert, or by that party if that party
has no attorney. This declaration shall be under penalty of perjury and shall
contain all of the following: 
“(1) A brief narrative statement of the qualifications
of each expert. 
“(2) A brief narrative statement of the general
substance of the testimony that the expert is expected to give. 
“(3) A representation that the expert has agreed to
testify at the trial. 
“(4) A representation that the expert will be
sufficiently familiar with the pending action to submit to a meaningful oral
deposition concerning the specific testimony, including an opinion and its
basis, that the expert is expected to give at trial. 
“(5) A statement of the expert’s hourly and daily fee
for providing deposition testimony and for consulting with the retaining
attorney.” 
(Code Civ.
Proc., § 2034.260.) 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2034.300 provides: 
“Except as provided in Section 2034.310 and in
Articles 4 (commencing with Section 2034.610) and 5 (commencing with Section
2034.710), on objection of any party who has made a complete and timely
compliance with Section 2034.260, the trial court shall exclude from evidence
the expert opinion of any witness that is offered by any party who has
unreasonably failed to do any of the following: 
“(a) List that witness as an expert under Section
2034.260. 
“(b) Submit an expert witness declaration. 
“(c) Produce reports and writings of expert witnesses
under Section 2034.270. 
“(d) Make that expert available for a deposition under
Article 3 (commencing with Section 2034.410).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2034.300.) 
DISCUSSION 
A.   The December 3, 2020 demand for exchange of expert
witness information 
On December
3, 2020, Defendants served a demand for exchange of expert witness information
on Plaintiff.  The December 3, 2020 demand
stated the “date of exchange” was January 1, 2021.  It included a proof of service showing Defendants
served the demand by email on Plaintiff’s counsel on December 3, 2020. 
According
to Plaintiff, neither side served an expert designation in response to the
December 3, 2020 demand because the Court continued the trial due to the
Covid-19 pandemic.  Defendants do not dispute
Plaintiff’s account. 
B.   The July 22, 2022 demand for exchange of expert
witness information 
On
July 22, 2022, Defendants served another demand for exchange of expert witness
information on Plaintiff.  The July 22, 2022
demand stated the “date of exchange” was September 12, 2022.  It included a proof of service showing Defendants
served the demand by email on Plaintiff’s counsel on July 22, 2022. 
Defendants
served an expert witness designation on September 12, 2022. 
Prior
to August 8, 2023, Plaintiff did not identify any expert to be called at trial,
did not provide an expert witness list, did not submit expert witness
declarations, did not produce reports and writings of expert witnesses, and did
not make any experts available for deposition. 
C.   Plaintiff’s August 8, 2023 service of a witness list 
On
August 8, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel served
a witness list on Defendants’ counsel. 
The witness list included the names of two experts: Rick Morales and Steve Bestin.  Plaintiff had not previously designated these
experts. 
D.   Defendants’ motion to exclude Plaintiff’s experts 
Defendants
argue the Court should exclude Plaintiff’s experts because Plaintiff did not
designate them by the “date of exchange” listed in the July 22, 2022 demand. 
In
response, Plaintiff denies receiving the July 22, 2022 demand for exchange of
expert witness information: “Plaintiff[ ] contend[s] that defendants did not
email the demand for Exchange of Expert as indicated in the proof of service
attached to defendant's request and defendants are trying to take an unfair
advantage by trying to exclude Plaintiff's expert witnesses from testifying at
trial.” According to Plaintiff’s counsel, he first learned about the July 22,
2022 demand for exchange of expert witness information on September 23, 2022, in
a phone call with Defendants’ counsel. 
Defendants
counter Plaintiff’s argument by providing a copy of a July 22, 2022 email to
Plaintiff’s counsel from Defendants' counsel’s office stating, “Attached please
find the following:  Demand for expert
witness ….”  The email includes an
attachment labeled “Expert Demand.” 
In
addition, Defendants’ counsel states the following in her declaration: 
“Shortly
after the CCP Section 998 had been served on or about March 22, 2023, I spoke
to Mr. Bowman on the phone on April 18, 2023 about the CCP Section 998 and
brought up the fact that he was precluded from calling expert again due to his
failure to designate experts. Mr. Bowman was going through his file while we
were on the phone and told me he located the Demand for Exchange of Expert
served in July 2022 and he complained Defendants had served the demand so early
that he had not responded to the demand. He never challenged the demand but
only said it was served long before the then current trial date.”  (Declaration of Ann C. Hall ¶ 8.) 
Having
reviewed this and other evidence included in the parties’ papers, the Court
finds that Plaintiff’s counsel received the July 22, 2022 demand for exchange
of expert witness information when Defendants’ counsel served it.  Plaintiff did not, however, serve an expert witness designation within the time specified in the demand. 
Defendants,
having timely complied with Code of Civil Procedure section 2034.260, have
standing to move to exclude Plaintiff’s late-designated experts.  The Court grants the
motion and excludes Plaintiff’s expert witnesses Rick Morales and Steve
Bestin from the trial. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS the motion of Defendants Kamnuan
Thongmanee and Arporn Thongmanee to exclude Plaintiff’s expert witnesses
Rick Morales and Steve Bestin from the trial. 
Moving
parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
parties are ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
