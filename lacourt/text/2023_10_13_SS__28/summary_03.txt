And here is the English summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Infinity Insurance Company's motion to intervene in the case as the insurer of defendant Osman Rauf Dost. The motion is based on Code of Civil Procedure section 387, which allows a nonparty to intervene if they have an interest in the matter or in the success of either party. Infinity Insurance Company argues that it has a right to join the action because it was acting as Dost's insurer at the time of the incident and may be liable to satisfy any judgment entered against Dost. The Court finds that Infinity Insurance Company has a right to join the action and grants the motion.
