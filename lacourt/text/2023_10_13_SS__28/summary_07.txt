And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has considered the motion filed by Defendant's counsel, Daniel Tapetillo, to be relieved as counsel. The motion requires notice of motion and motion to be directed to the client, a declaration stating why a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1), service of the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case, and a proposed order relieving counsel. The Court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, but the motion should be granted only if there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. The Court finds that the motion has not been properly filed, as the proposed order relieving counsel was not submitted, and proof of service on all parties who have appeared, including Defendant, was not submitted. Therefore, the Court denies the motion.
