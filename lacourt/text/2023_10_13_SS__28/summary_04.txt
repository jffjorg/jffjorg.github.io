English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment filed by Moving Defendants (Caliber Holdings, LLC, Jose Castro, Caliber Bodyworks, LLC, and RCB Equities South Bay, LLC). The motion was denied because the judge found that Plaintiff (Eric Cottrell) has raised a triable issue of fact under the Kinsman exception, which concerns concealed hazards. The judge determined that the improperly spaced joists in the mezzanine area of the substructure were a concealed hazard that Moving Defendants knew of but did not warn Plaintiff about. The judge concluded that Moving Defendants failed to meet their burden of demonstrating that they did not know or could not have reasonably discovered the concealed hazard, and therefore, the motion for summary judgment was denied.
