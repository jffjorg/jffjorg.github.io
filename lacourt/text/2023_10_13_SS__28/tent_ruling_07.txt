 Case Number:  22STCV35509    Hearing Date:   October 13, 2023    Dept:  28 


Having considered the moving papers, the Court rules
  as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On July 11, 2022, Plaintiff Colin-Kirk B. Hodge
  (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Edwyn Charles Huang
  (“Defendant”) and Does 1-10, for assault, battery, intentional infliction of
  emotional distress, and negligence. 
On February 21, 2023, Plaintiff filed a first
  amended complaint against the same defendants for assault, battery,
  intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence, violation of
  Article 184 of the Taiwanese Civil Code, violation of Article 193 of the
  Taiwanese Civil Code, and violation of Article 195 of the Taiwanese Civil
  Code. 
On May 9, 2023, the Court sustained
  without leave to amend Defendant Huang’s demurrer with respect to the first
  through fourth causes of action of the first amended complaint and overruled
  the demurrer to the fifth through seventh causes of action. 
On May 24, 2023, Defendant filed an answer. 
On August 9, 2023, Defendant’s counsel, Daniel
  Tapetillo, filed a motion to be relieved as counsel to be heard on October
  13, 2023. 
Trial is currently scheduled for May 7, 2024. 
COUNSEL’S REQUEST 
Defendant’s counsel, Daniel Tapetillo, requests to
  be relieved as counsel. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be
  Relieved as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and motion to be directed
  to the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel—Civil
  form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general terms and without compromising
  the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under
  Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent
  under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the Declaration in
  Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-052)); (3)
  service of the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order
  on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the
  proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney’s Motion
  to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). 
The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw.  The motion should be granted if there is no
  prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice.
  (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.) 
DISCUSSION 
Counsel submitted completed MC-051 and MC-052 forms
  but did not submit the MC-053 form. Counsel must submit all three documents
  for the Court to grant the requested relief. Counsel also failed to submit
  proof of service on all parties who have appeared, including Defendant. The Court
  denies the motion. CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES Defendant’s counsel's motion to be relieved
  as counsel. 
Counsel is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Counsel is ordered to file the proof of service of
  this ruling with the Court within five days.
