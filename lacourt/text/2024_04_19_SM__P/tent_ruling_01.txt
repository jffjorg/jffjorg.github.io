Annie
Fradin, et al. v. 1233 Penmar LLC, et al., Case No. 23SMCV03914
Hearing
date April 19, 2024
Plaintiff’s
Counsel’s Motion to be Relieved 
 This is a nuisance action commenced by several plaintiffs
who allege defendants who operate the Penmar Restaurant have allowed or created
loud and excessive noise at the subject premises since November 2020. 
Counsel
William Litvak of Dapeer, Rosenbilt & Litvak, LLP seeks to be relieved as
counsel for plaintiff Susan Santora. Counsel Litvak contends that there has a
been a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. See MC-052 at ¶ 2.  Under the circumstances, the court finds that
this reason is acceptable and that plaintiff Santora will not be prejudiced as
a result. See Ramirez v. Sturdevant
(1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904, 915. Plaintiff does not object, and trial is not
until 11/18/24, sufficient time to allow plaintiff to find new counsel. 
Counsel
Litvak submitted the necessary forms required under California Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362. Further, based on the proof of service attached to the filings,
the service requirement under California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d) has
been satisfied. 
Accordingly,
because Counsel Litvak has complied with the requirements set for under
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, the motion to be relieved as counsel is
GRANTED.
