And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted Counsel Litvak's motion to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff Susan Santora. The breakdown in the attorney-client relationship was deemed an acceptable reason for relief. Since trial is not until November 18, 2024, plaintiff Santora has sufficient time to find new counsel. Counsel Litvak has complied with the requirements set forth in California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, and the service requirement has been satisfied. The court finds that plaintiff Santora will not be prejudiced by this relief.
