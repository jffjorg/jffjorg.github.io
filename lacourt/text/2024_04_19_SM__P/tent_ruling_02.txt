Ruling
Lady
JGerard v. Move Central Inc., Case No. 24SMCV00889
Hearing
date April 19, 2024
OSC
re: Preliminary Injunction
Plaintiff
Lady JGerard hired defendant Move Central, Inc. to move the contents of her
clothing store. Lady J alleges that after packing up her clothes, Move demanded
more money than agreed upon to complete the move. Lady J alleges Move is
holding her possessions and has stated it will auction them off if she does not
pay the outstanding increased amount demanded.
On February
29, 2024 the court granted Lady J’s ex parte application for temporary
restraining order to stay the auction of the inventory. A hearing for the
preliminary injunction was set for April 3, 2024. See 2/28/24 Minute Order. On
April 3, 2024 the court continued the hearing because defendant’s papers were
not served and allowed additional time. No opposition was filed. 
“[A] court
will deny a preliminary injunction unless there is a reasonable probability
that the plaintiff will be successful on the merits, but the granting of a
preliminary injunction does not amount to an adjudication of the merits.” See Beehan
v. Lido Isle Community Ass’n. (1977) 70 Cal.App.3d 858, 866. In determining
whether a preliminary injunction should be issued, the court considers: “(1)
how likely it is that the moving party will prevail on the merits, and (2) the
relative harm the parties will suffer in the interim due to the issuance or
nonissuance of the injunction.” See Dodge, Warren & Peters Ins.
Services, Inc. v. Riley (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 1414, 1420.
Lady J
contends Move is bound to follow regulations set by the Public Utilities
Commission, including the requirement to provide a written estimate, but Lady J
failed to cite any such regulation. The court cannot readily conclude Lady J
has shown she will succeed on her claim. With regard to her financial elder
abuse claim, Lady J is over 65 years of age, and she has shown Move retained
her inventory and wrongfully demanded more money. See LadyJ Decl. ¶¶ 1, 19-20.
With regard
to the second prong, Lady J has shown she would suffer loss of her inventory if
the injunction is not issued. LadyJ Decl. ¶21. To preserve the status quo, the
court will issue the requested injunction.
Code of
Civil Procedure §529 requires plaintiff to provide an undertaking. See ABBA
Rubber Co. v. Seaquist (1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1, 10 (the duty to order a
bond is “mandatory, not discretionary.”). Because Move has not filed an opposition,
it is unclear what damages they might suffer. The court sets the undertaking at
$10,000. GRANTED. Lady J to file the undertaking and proposed order within 10
days.
