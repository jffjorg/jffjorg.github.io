Petition Before the Court
On
May 17, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a petition for approval of a minor’s compromise
for settlement of this action as it relates to Plaintiff Ronny Emilio
Maldonado, a minor whose guardian ad litem is his parent, Angela Gutierrez, the
petitioner.
The
petition is unopposed and now before the Court.
 
II. Petition for
Approval of Minor’s Compromise: GRANTED.
A.
Legal Standard
Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 372, any compromise of claim or action or
disposition of proceeds of judgment made for a minor or adult with a disability
must be approved by the Court. (See also Prob. Code § 3600, subd. (b) [a
compromise or covenant for a disputed claim or damages, money, or other
property of a minor or person who lacks legal capacity is valid only after it
has been approved by the superior court].) A petition for court approval of a
compromise of a minor or disabled adult’s compromise or judgment of a pending
action or proceeding to which this person is a party must be verified by the
petitioner and must contain a full disclosure of all information that has any
bearing upon the reasonableness of the compromise, covenant, settlement, or
disposition. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950; see also Cal. Rules of Court,
rules 7.950.5-7.955.) The petition is generally submitted on a completed
Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim or Action or Disposition of
Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or Person with a Disability (Judicial Council
form MC-350). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.) If the Court is satisfied that
the compromise, covenant, settlement, or disposition is in the best interest of
the person, then the Court should approve the same. (See Pearson v. Superior
Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338.) 
B.
Analysis
1. Procedural Requirements
A
review of the petition shows that it meets all the requirements in California
Rules of Court, rules 7.950 to 7.955.
a. Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950
The
petition satisfies California Rules of Court, rule 7.950.
The
petition was filed on verified Civil Form MC-350 seeking confirmation of
judgment against Defendants on behalf of Ronny Emilio Maldonado. (Petition, p. 10
[Petitioner verification].) The petition also contains a full disclosure of all
information that bears upon the reasonableness of the compromise, covenant,
settlement, or disposition. The petition indicates that the total settlement
amount among all four Plaintiffs is $80,000. (Petition, p. 3, §§ 10.a.,
11.b.(1).) The gross proceeds allocated to Ronny Emilio Maldonado are $5,000. (Petition,
p. 3, §§ 10.a.) The net proceeds allocated to Ronny Emilio Maldonado are $3,250.58.
(Petition, p. 6, § 15., 16.f.)
b. Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.951
The
petition satisfies California Rules of Court, rule 7.951.
This
requirement provides that where a petitioner has been represented or assisted
by an attorney in preparing the petition to compromise the claim or in any
other respect with regard to the claim, the petition must disclose specific
information, which the petition contains as follows:
(1)
The name, state bar number, law firm, if any, and business address of the
attorney. (Petition, p. 7, § 17.b.(1)-(3) [Daniel Gibalevich, Esq./Rachel
Fishenfeld, Esq., SBN Nos. 217116/270310, DAG Law Firm APC, 12711 Ventura
Blvd., Suite 220, Studio City, California 91604].)
(2)
Whether the attorney has received any attorney’s fees or other compensation for
services provided in connection with the claim giving rise to the petition or
with the preparation of the petition, and, if so, the amounts and the identity
of the person who paid the fees or other compensation. (Petition, p. 7, § 17.c.
[has not been compensated].)
(3)
Whether the attorney became involved with the petition, directly or indirectly,
at the instance of any party against whom the claim is asserted or of any
party’s insurance carrier. (Petition, p. 7, § 17.d. [did not so become involved].)
(4)
Whether the attorney represents or is employed by any other party or any
insurance carrier involved in the matter. (Petition, p. 7, § 17.e. [answered “is
not” representing another party but Complaint shows that counsel represents all
Plaintiffs, not just Ronny Emilio Maldonado].)
(5)
If the attorney has not received any attorney’s fees or other compensation for
services provided in connection with the claim giving rise to the petition or
with the preparation of the petition, whether the attorney expects to receive
any fees or other compensation for these services, and, if so, the amounts and
the identity of the person who is expected to pay the fees or other
compensation. (Petition, p. 7, § 17.f. [expects compensation of $30,000 in
compensation through settlement with Defendants].)
(6)  The terms of any agreement between the
petitioner and the attorney. (Petition, § 17.(2), Attach. 17(a)(2) [retainer
agreement].)
c. Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.952
The
petition satisfies California Rules of Court, rule 7.952.
This
is because Plaintiffs (Ronny and his parent) are excused from personally
appearing at any hearing in light of good cause dispensing with the need for an
appearance.
d. Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.953
The
petition need not satisfy California Rules of Court, rule 7.953.
This
rule provides that, where ordered by the Court, an order for the deposit of
funds of a minor or a person with disability with a financial institution must
be provided.
Here,
the petition does not include a Judicial Council form MC-355, Order to Deposit
Money into Blocked Account. (See Petition, §§ 17.(2), 17.(5).) Moreover, the
Court has not and does not order an acknowledgment of receipt by any financial
institution here.
e. Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.954
The
petition need not satisfy California Rules of Court, rule 7.954.
This
rule provides the requirements for requesting the withdrawal of funds already
deposited in favor of a minor or person with a disability pursuant to a prior
compromise, which is not the case here.
f. Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.955
The
petition satisfies California Rules of Court, rule 7.955.
This
rule requires that the Court determine whether the attorney’s fees charged of a
minor or a person with a disability are reasonable.
Here,
the fees to be charged from Ronny Emilio Maldonado are $1,250, which is exactly
a quarter of the total settlement amount to be paid to Ronny Emilio Maldonado.
(Compare Petition, § 16.a., with Petition, § 16.c.)
2. Substantive Requirements
The
Court finds that the judgment allocation is in the best interests of Plaintiff Ronny
Emilio Maldonado. (See Pearson v. Superior Court, supra, 202
Cal.App.4th at p. 1338.)
Plaintiff
Ronny Emilio Maldonado will receive a gross settlement of $5,000 out of the
total $80,000 gross settlement for all four Plaintiffs. (Petition, p. 3, 10.a.,
11.b.(1).) The remaining part of the judgment collected will be distributed the
remaining three plaintiffs (Petition, p. 3, §§ 11(a), 12(b)(3)), where the
minors’ parents will receive a gross $70,000 of the $80,000 settlement and are
best positioned to use the net proceeds to further the economic welfare and
wellbeing of Ronny Emilio Maldonado.
 
III. Conclusion
Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim
or Action or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or Person with a
Disability [Res ID # 1958] is GRANTED.
The Court signs the concurrently filed
proposed order.
