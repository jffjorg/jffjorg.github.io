And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to compel binding arbitration. The defendant, Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC, sought to compel arbitration of the plaintiff's claims arising from the Song-Beverly Act and negligent repair. The Judge found that the defendant lacks standing to enforce the arbitration clause in the lease agreement because it is not a direct beneficiary of the agreement and the claims do not arise from the terms of the lease. Furthermore, the Judge found that the doctrine of equitable estoppel does not apply in this case because the plaintiff's claims are not inextricably intertwined with the vehicle's sales contract. The Judge's ruling is based on the analysis of the relevant laws, including the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) and the California Arbitration Act (Code Civ. Proc., § 1280 et seq.), as well as the parties' agreements and the facts of the case.
