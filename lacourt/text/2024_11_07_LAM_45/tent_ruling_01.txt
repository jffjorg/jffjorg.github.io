Background
This is a breach
of contract case. On June 11, 2020, Plaintiff Westlake Flooring Company, LLC (Plaintiff)
filed the complaint against defendant Kenton William Merrihew (Defendant),
alleging that Defendant personally guaranteed a set of loans loans sold to
Plaintiff and became personally liable on certain loans that went bad.
On June 30,
2020, the parties entered into a written settlement agreement in which
Defendant was to pay $15,000 to Plaintiff via consecutive monthly payments of
no less than $250, starting from July 15, 2020 and continuing for a period of
sixty months. Defendant made payments for a total of $11,250 and has not made
payments thereafter.
On May 24, 2024,
Plaintiff filed this motion to enforce the settlement agreement. No opposition
has been filed.
 
Legal
Standard
Code of Civil
Procedure section 664.6 states: “If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in
a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If
requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to
enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.”
Strict
compliance with the statutory requirements is necessary before a court can
enforce a settlement agreement under this statute.¿ (Sully-Miller
Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103
Cal.App.4th 30, 37.)¿ To enforce a written settlement agreement under Code of
Civil Procedure section 664.6, the following three elements must be met: (1)
the parties must have come to a meeting of the minds on all material points;
(2) there must be a writing that contains the material terms of the agreement;
and (3) the writing must be signed by the parties, an attorney who represents
the party, or an agent authorized by an insurer to sign on the party’s behalf.¿
(Weddington Productions, Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793,
797-98; Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6.)
 
Discussion
            Enforce Settlement
The court finds that the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure
section 664.6 have been satisfied. The settlement agreement was entered into by
the parties as part of a pending litigation. The parties both signed the
agreement in writing. The written agreement contained the material terms of the
agreement, and there is no indication that the parties did not come to a
meeting of the minds on all material points. The parties stipulated for the
court to retain jurisdiction to enforce the agreement.
Plaintiff has submitted evidence that Defendant has breached the terms
of the settlement agreement. (Friedman Decl., ¶ 5; Ex. B.) The settlement
agreement states that, in the even of default, the full amount of $25,019.26
shall come due, plus interest, attorney’s fees, and court costs, less such
payments that have already been made. (Friedman Decl., Ex. A.) Defendant has
paid $11,250; therefore, the remaining principal is $13,769.26.
Defendant has not filed any opposition.
Plaintiff’s motion to enforce the settlement is therefore GRANTED.
 
            Sanctions
            Plaintiff
additionally requests attorney’s fees in the amount of $892.50, based on an
hourly rate of $595 for 1.5 hours, and court costs of $60, for a total of
$952.50. The court finds this amount reasonable.
 
For the
foregoing reasons, the motion to enforce the settlement is GRANTED. Defendant
is ordered to pay a total amount of $14,721.76 in remaining principal,
attorney’s fees, and court costs.
 
            It
is so ordered.
