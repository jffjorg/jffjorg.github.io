TENTATIVE

The Motions to be Relieved as Counsel for Defendant MEG Home Plus
LLC and Jie Li are DENIED without prejudice. 
Counsel is ordered to give notice of this ruling and file proof of
service of same within five calendar days. 
BACKGROUND
This is a breach of contract action. On May 26, 2023, plaintiff Xchange
USA Inc. (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants MEG Home Plus, LLC
(MEG), Jie Li (Jie), Cynthia Li, Jing Li (collectively, Defendants), and Does 1
to 25, alleging causes of action for breach of contract, common count: open
book account, and declaratory relief. 
On
December 22, 2023, Matt Putterman of Putterman Law, APC filed motions to be
relieved as counsel for Defendants MEG and Jie. The motions are unopposed. 
LEGAL
STANDARD
The Court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted, provided that there is no prejudice to the client, and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 403-407.)
A motion to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Council
Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053
(Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) The requisite forms must be served “on the client and on all
parties that have appeared in the case.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362,
subd. (d).) 
DISCUSSION
Matt
Putterman of Putterman Law, APC (Counsel) seeks to be relieved as counsel for Defendants
MEG and Jie. Counsel contends MEG and Jie have breached their retainer
agreement and that there has been a breakdown in the attorney-client
relationship. (Putterman Decls., ¶ 2.) 
The
Court finds this to be proper grounds for withdrawal. Grounds for
permitting an attorney to withdraw from representation include the client’s
conduct that “renders it unreasonably difficult for the lawyer to carry out the
representation effectively[.]” (Cal. Rules of Professional Conduct, rule 1.16,
subd. (b)(4).) A breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is also grounds
for allowing the attorney to withdraw. (Estate of Falco (1987) 188
Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014.) 
            However,
Counsel failed to lodge Judicial Council Form MC-053, i.e., the proposed
orders, with the moving papers and thereby failed to comply with Rule 3.1362,
subdivision (e), of the California Rules of Court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362, subd. (e) [“The proposed order relieving
counsel must be prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel--Civil
(form MC-053) and must be lodged with the court with the moving papers.”]) Counsel’s
declarations also fail to provide the time and place for the Case Management
Conference on February 29, 2024. (Putterman Decls., ¶ 4.)  
Therefore, the Court DENIES the motions without prejudice. 
CONCLUSION
The Motions to be Relieved as Counsel are DENIED without
prejudice. 
Counsel is ordered to give notice of this ruling and file proof of
service of same within five calendar days.
