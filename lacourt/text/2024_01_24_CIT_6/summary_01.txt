And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court grants the motion for summary judgment filed by Defendant San Dimas Community Hospital. The Hospital moved for summary judgment on the grounds that there is no triable issue of fact regarding its compliance with the standard of care in providing medical treatment to Plaintiff Steven Anthony Montoya. The Hospital's expert, Dr. Ryan M. Klein, testified that the Hospital complied with the standard of care and did not cause or contribute to the Plaintiff's alleged injuries. The Court finds that the Hospital has met its initial burden in establishing the absence of a triable issue of material fact and that the Plaintiff has failed to present any evidence in opposition to the motion. Therefore, the Court grants the motion for summary judgment and orders the Hospital to give notice of the Court's ruling within five calendar days of this order.
