And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied, without prejudice, the motions of Matt Putterman, Counsel for MEG Home Plus, LLC and Jie Li, to be relieved as counsel. The motions are unopposed, but Counsel failed to comply with the California Rules of Court by not lodging the proposed orders with the court. Additionally, the declarations filed by Counsel did not provide the time and place for the Case Management Conference scheduled for February 29, 2024. The Judge finds that the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is proper grounds for Counsel's withdrawal, but the failure to comply with the court's rules requires the denial of the motions without prejudice.
