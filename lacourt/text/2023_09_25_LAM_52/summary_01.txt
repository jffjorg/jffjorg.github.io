Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion in limine filed by Outfront Media VW Communications, LLC to exclude the testimony of Yones Kabir, an expert witness for the defendants. The Judge has determined that the plaintiff has not established grounds for excluding Kabir's testimony under Code of Civil Procedure section 2034.300, which allows the court to exclude expert opinions if a party has unreasonably failed to produce expert reports and writings as required by section 2034.270.

The Judge has found that Kabir did not search for documents responsive to the requests for production included in the notice of his deposition, but has testified that he did not search for documents personally written or created by him. The Judge has therefore determined that the appropriate remedy is to require Kabir to search for all documents requested and to permit the plaintiff to depose Kabir for an additional two hours.

The Judge has granted the motion in part, permitting further deposition of Yones Kabir, and has ordered Kabir to search for all documents requested in the notice of his deposition within 7 days and to make him available for an additional two hours of deposition within 14 days.
