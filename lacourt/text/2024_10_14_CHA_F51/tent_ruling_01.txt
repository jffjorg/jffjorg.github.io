ANTI-SLAPP MOTION
TO STRIKE

Los Angeles Superior Court Case
# 24CHCV00362

  
Motion Filed: 5/22/24
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendants Michael J. Doubet; and
Carter R. Taylor (collectively, “Defendants”)
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Jamie Mahjobi, in pro
per (“Plaintiff”)
NOTICE: OK 
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order striking Plaintiff’s
entire first amended complaint (“FAC”). Defendants also seek to recover
attorney fees and costs in the amount of $6,525.00.
 
TENTATIVE RULING: The motion is off-calendar as moot.
 
BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff alleges that Defendants,
attorneys who represent nonparty David Fermelia in an underlying case,
“intrude[d] into [the] private record of plaintiff such as medical, personal,
financial and other privileged and private information” on an unspecified date.
(FAC ¶ 1.)
 
On 2/6/24, Plaintiff filed her
original complaint against Defendants, alleging the following causes of action:
(1) Intrusion into Privacy; and (2) Harassment. On 4/17/24, Plaintiff filed her
FAC, alleging against Defendants the following causes of action: (1) Invasion
of Privacy; (2) Aiding and Abetting Invasion of Privacy; (3) Intentional and
Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress; (4) Harassment; (5) Defamation; (6)
Violation of Civil Rights; and (7) Conspiracy to Interfere with Civil Rights.
 
On 5/23/24, Defendants filed the
instant special motion to strike Plaintiff’s entire FAC. No opposition has been
filed to date.
 
On 9/10/24, the Court sustained
Defendants’ demurrer to Plaintiff’s FAC with 30 days leave to amend. To the
extent that the Court was unclear in its ruling on the demurrer to Plaintiff’s
FAC, the special motion to strike is therefore moot because the pleading it
challenges is no longer operative. (B. F. G. Builders v. Weisner &
Coover Co. (1962) 206 Cal.App.2d 752, 758–759 [it is proper procedure for
the Court to sustain a demurrer with leave to amend and remove an accompanying
motion to strike from the Court’s calendar].)
 
The Court notes that the instant
ruling does not preclude Defendants from filing a special anti-SLAPP motion to
strike attacking Plaintiff’s forthcoming second amended complaint. 
 
The Court is also mindful of the
general delays experienced by parties with scheduling motion dates, and notes
that the parties may file ex parte applications to advance motion dates as
necessary, subject to the Court’s discretion and availability.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is off-calendar as moot. Case Management Conference
is continued to 12/16/2024 at 8:30 a.m.
