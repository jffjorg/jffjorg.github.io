And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the anti-SLAPP motion to strike filed by the Defendants (Michael J. Doubet and Carter R. Taylor) against the Plaintiff (Jamie Mahjobi). The motion seeks to strike the Plaintiff's entire first amended complaint (FAC) and recover attorney fees and costs in the amount of $6,525.00. The Judge has determined that the motion is moot because the Court sustained the Defendants' demurrer to the Plaintiff's FAC with 30 days leave to amend. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff's forthcoming second amended complaint may still be subject to an anti-SLAPP motion to strike. The case is continued to a Case Management Conference on December 16, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
