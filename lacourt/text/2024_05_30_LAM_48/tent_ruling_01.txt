  CASE NO.: 21STCV24038
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER CONTINUING MOTION TO SET
  ASIDE/VACATE DEFAULT AND MOTION TO QUASH SERVICE OF SUMMONS 
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
May 30, 2024



 
On May 6, 2024, Defendant Temple
Weatherly Williams filed a motion to vacate the entry of default against him and
a motion to quash services of the summons and complaint.  Both motions argue that Defendant was not properly
served.
On
May 22, 2024, Defendant filed his reply to Plaintiff’s oppositions.  The reply was accompanied by two declarations
and additional exhibits.  The reply raises
a new argument about the parties’ attempts to stipulate to a resolution of the default
and service issues.
On
May 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request to strike the reply or to obtain leave to
file a sur-reply.
The
request to file a sur-reply is granted.  Plaintiff
may file a sur-reply that addresses only Defendant’s reply (including the accompanying
new evidence) no later than June 20, 2024.
The
Hearing on Motion to Set Aside/Vacate Default and Hearing on Motion to Quash Service
of Summons are CONTINUED to June 27, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 48 at Stanley
Mosk Courthouse.
Alternatively,
if the parties reach an agreement about vacating the default and accepting service,
they may file a stipulation and proposed order, and the motions should be withdrawn.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
