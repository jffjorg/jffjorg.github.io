And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in this case, denying as moot the motions to compel responses to discovery requests and to deem requests for admission admitted. The court finds that the plaintiff failed to serve timely responses to discovery requests, and that the plaintiff's counsel is responsible for the delay. The court orders the plaintiff's counsel to pay sanctions of $4,178.00 to the defendant. The court also orders the plaintiff's counsel to pay one additional filing fee within 10 days. The court notes that the parties must file a separate motion for each set of discovery, and warns that continued action of this type may result in monetary sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 177.5.
