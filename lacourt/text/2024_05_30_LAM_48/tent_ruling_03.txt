On
March 22, 2024, Plaintiff Isabel Kilroe served Requests For Production of Documents,
Special Interrogatories, Form Interrogatories, and Requests for Admissions on Defendant
FCA US LLC.  Defendant did not serve responses.
On
May 3, 2024 and May 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed three motions to compel Defendant’s
responses and one motion to deem the RFAs admitted.  Each motion also requested sanctions.
Where
a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the Court may make
an order compelling responses.  (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300; Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)   A party that fails to serve timely responses
waives any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection
of attorney work product.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300, subd. (a).) 

When
a party fails to timely respond to a request for admission, the propounding party
may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any
matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)  The party who failed to respond waives any objections
to the demand, unless the court grants them relief from the waiver, upon a showing
that the party (1) has subsequently served a substantially compliant response, and
(2) that the party’s failure to respond was the result of mistake, inadvertence,
or excusable neglect.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subds. (a)(1)-(2).)  The court shall
grant a motion to deem admitted requests for admissions, “unless it finds that the
party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the
hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is
in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
Defendant
did not serve responses to Plaintiff’s discovery and filed no oppositions to these
motions.
The
motions to compel are GRANTED.  Defendant
is ORDERED to serve verified responses, without objections, to Plaintiff’s Requests
For Production of Documents, Special Interrogatories, and Form Interrogatories within
30 days of this order.
The
motion to deem RFAs admitted is also GRANTED. 
Plaintiff’s Request for Admissions is deemed admitted by Defendant.
The
requests for sanctions are GRANTED IN PART. 
The Court determines that sanctions are appropriately imposed against counsel,
not the client, because no oppositions were filed and no explanation was provided
for the failure to timely respond to discovery. 
Defendant’s counsel is ORDERED to pay sanctions of $4,000.00 to Plaintiff
within 30 days.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
