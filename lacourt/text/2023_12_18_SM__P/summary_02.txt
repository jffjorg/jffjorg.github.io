And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is to sustain Leong's demurrer without leave to amend. The complaint filed by SM 1000, the landlord, is defective because it does not strictly comply with the statutory notice standard. The complaint incorrectly states the amount of rent due, which is $12,157.92, when the lease agreement specifies a monthly rent of $11,500 with additional fees. The Judge notes that the unlawful detainer statutes must be followed strictly, and the complaint's failure to adhere to these requirements renders it fatally defective. The Judge will not allow SM 1000 to amend the complaint to cure its defects.
