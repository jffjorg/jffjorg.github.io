Lone Oak Fund, LLC
v. 1046 Genesee, LLC, Case No. 23SMCV04054 
Hearing Date
October 19, 2023 continued to December 18, 2023
Plaintiff’s
Application for Temporary Restraining Order and Appointment of Receiver
Plaintiff – Supplemental Briefing 
 
Plaintiff Lone Oak
Fund alleges defendant 1046 Genesee defaulted on its mortgage. Loan Oak argues pursuant
to the deed of trust, the court must issue a temporary restraining order
preventing use of rental income other than discharging mortgage debt. Lone Oak
seeks a receiver. On October 6, 2023 the court continued the hearing to review
evidence in Lone Oak’s reply brief and allow Genesee to file a sur-reply. 
 
Lone Oak presents
declarations of Hugh Gross and William Licker, who found evidence of
habitation, such as a swimming pool with a hose placed inside it, a barbecue
with a bag of charcoal, a lighter and lighter fluid nearby and two parked cars.
Gross decl. ¶¶3-4. Licker’s photographs show parked cars, a television, shelves
of books, pictures and personal items, laundry and kitchen counters covered
with containers. Licker decl., exh. 1-7. The photographs -7 are strong evidence
the property is being occupied. 
 
That the property
is currently occupied, however, does not establish Lone Oak’s entitlement to a receiver.
Lone Oak has presented no evidence that irreparable harm will result if a
receiver is not appointed. In opposition to the initial motion, Genesee
presented ample evidence there is no danger of irreparable harm, since the
property is fully insured, secured from outsiders, and up to date on its taxes
and assessment. Kenig decl. ¶¶5-7. Without a likelihood of irreparable harm,
the court will not take the drastic step of appointing a receiver, regardless
of the provisions in the deed of trust. DENIED.
