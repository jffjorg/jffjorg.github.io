SM 1000 Property
LLC v. Leong et al., Case No. 23SMCV05128
Hearing Date December
18, 2023 
Defendant Leong’s
Demurrer to Plaintiff SM 1000’s Complaint 
 
In this unlawful
detainer action, landlord plaintiff SM 1000 alleges failure to pay rent of $12,157.92
due October 2023. Leong demurs. 
 
If a plaintiff in a demurrer action does not strictly
comply with the statutory notice standard, the unlawful detainer complaint is
subject to demurrer. E.g. Barbara Parsons v. Superior Court (2007) 149
Cal.App.4th Supp. 1, 6. A notice to pay rent or quit which overstates the rent
due is ineffective. Ernst Enter, Inv. v. Sun Valley Gasoline, Inc. (1983)
139 Cal.App.3d 355, 359.
Leong argues the
complaint overstates the rent due, requesting $12,157.92 while stating Leong
agreed to pay $11,500 per month.
 
SM 1000 objects
that Leong failed to meet and confer before filing the demurrer. Cal. Code of
Civ. Proc. §430.41(a). The demurrer does not include a meet and confer
declaration as required under §430.41(a)(2). Nonetheless, “[a] determination by
the court that the meet and confer process was insufficient shall not be
grounds to overrule or sustain a demurrer.” Cal. Code of Civ. Proc.
§430.41(a)(4). The court will consider the merits of the demurrer. 
 
SM 1000 argues the
lease states that in addition to the monthly rent of $11,500, Leong must pay
monthly parking and technology fees, a total of $12,050 each month. Exhibit 1
¶1 (C), (E), (H), and (I). The request for $12,157.92 is based on that sum plus
prejudgment interest. 
 
This explanation
is not present in the complaint, which states that Leong agreed to pay rent of
$11,500 and requests prejudgment interest but does not clarify that the parking/technology
fees make up part of the allegedly past-due $12,157.92. 
 
"Unlawful
detainer is a highly specialized form of litigation. Highly summary in nature,
the code requirements must be followed strictly, otherwise a landlord's remedy
is an ordinary suit for breach of contract with all the delays that that remedy
normally involves and without restitution of the demised property." Cal-American
Income Property Fund IV. v. Ho (1984) 161 Cal.App.3d 583, 585. Cal. Code of
Civ. Proc. 1161.
 
SM 1000 failed to
adhere to the strict requirements under the unlawful detainer statutes, and
incorrectly stated the amount due. The complaint is fatally defective under Parsons
and Ernst Enter and cannot be cured by amendment. SUSTAINED without
leave to amend.
