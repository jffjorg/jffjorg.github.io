And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case between Lone Oak Fund, LLC and 1046 Genesee, LLC. The plaintiff, Lone Oak, is seeking a temporary restraining order and the appointment of a receiver due to the defendant's alleged default on the mortgage. Lone Oak presented evidence of habitation on the property, including a swimming pool, barbecue, and personal items, but the judge finds that this does not establish the entitlement to a receiver. The defendant, 1046 Genesee, presented evidence that the property is fully insured, secured from outsiders, and up to date on taxes and assessment, which the judge finds to be strong evidence that there is no danger of irreparable harm. Without a likelihood of irreparable harm, the court will not appoint a receiver, regardless of the provisions in the deed of trust. The judge denies the plaintiff's request.
