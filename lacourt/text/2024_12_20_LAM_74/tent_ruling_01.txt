  Case Number:  24STCV04764    Hearing Date:   December 20, 2024    Dept:  74 Edwards et
al. v. American Tax Service et al. 
Defendants Tyler Bennett and
Terrance Selb’s Demurrer.
 
            In
this case arising from an employer’s allegedly wrongful termination of plaintiffs,
the court sustains without leave to amend the unopposed demurrer by individual
employee defendants Terrance J. Selb and Tyler Bennett (Defendants) to the
causes of action for (1) Employment Discrimination (Race) – Hostile
Environment; (2) Employment Discrimination (Race) – Disparate Treatment; (3)
Employment Discrimination (Disability); (4) Employment Discrimination –
Retaliation; (5) Failure to Engage in a Good Faith Interactive Process; and (7)
Wrongful Termination.
The
court overrules, however, Selb and Bennett’s demurrer to the sixth cause of
action for “Employment Discrimination – Unlawful Harassment” because the complaint
alleges that (1) Plaintiffs are members of a protected group; (2) Plaintiffs
were subjected to harassment; (3) the harassment was based on Plaintiffs’
protected status; (4) the harassment created a hostile and toxic work
environment; and (5) the employer is liable. 
(Complaint ¶ 10, 12, 16, 21, 75-81.) 
Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that “Protected Employees… were subject
to rude, cruel, untrue, harsh, discriminatory, stereotypical, negative and
derogatory comments…” and Defendants made “inappropriate and unprofessional
comments about Protected Employees in the workplace and to and about
Plaintiff.”  (Complaint ¶ 12(h),
(o).)  Additionally, Plaintiffs allege
that Defendants made “false, slanderous statements about complaints (including,
without limitation, Plaintiff) in their professional and personal lives.”  (Complaint ¶ 18(h), (i).)
Defendants to give
notice.
