The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Edwards et al. v. American Tax Service et al. The case involves allegations of employment discrimination, wrongful termination, and failure to engage in a good faith interactive process. The individual employee defendants, Terrance J.

The judge has ordered the defendants to give notice of the ruling.
