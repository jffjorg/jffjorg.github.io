And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied Defendant's special anti-SLAPP motion to strike Plaintiff's complaint. The court found that Defendant failed to show that Plaintiff's claims arise from protected speech or activity. The court also found that Plaintiff has made a prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment on its claims of breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, interference with contractual relations, nuisance, and declaratory relief. The court therefore denied Defendant's motion and denied her request for attorney fees.
