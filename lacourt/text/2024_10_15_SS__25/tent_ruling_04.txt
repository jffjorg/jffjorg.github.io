ANALYSIS:
 
 
I.                   
Background
 
On October 11, 2023, Plaintiff Usvaldo Llamas
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action alleging motor vehicle and general negligence
causes of action against Defendant Collette Macarthur (“Defendant”) and Does
1-50. The action arises out of Defendant’s alleged failure to control a vehicle.
(Compl., ¶ 5.) Plaintiff seeks damages that include loss of use of property, hospital
and medical expenses, general damages, and property damage. (Compl., ¶ 11.) 
 
Defendant filed an Answer to the Complaint on March 28,
2024. 
 
On April 24, 2024, Plaintiff served his Demand for
Production of Documents, Set One, and Form Interrogatories, Set One, onto
Defendant. 
 
From May 30, 2024 to August 30, 2024, the parties engaged
in multiple email exchanges regarding the discovery requests. (RPD Hakim Decl.,
¶¶ 3-4, Exh. 3; FROGs Hakim Decl., ¶¶ 3-4, Exh. 3.) 
 
On August 6 and 7, 2024, Defendant served responses to
the Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Production, Set One, onto Plaintiff.
(RPD Hakim Decl., ¶ 2, Exh. 1; FROGs Hakim Decl., ¶ 2, Exh. 2.) 
 
On September 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motions
for Order Compelling Defendant to Provide Further Responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Production. Plaintiff also moved for
an Order Imposing Monetary Sanctions regarding both motions. 
 
Defendant did not file an Opposition brief to the
motions. Plaintiff filed a Reply brief on October 7, 2024 as to both motions,
noting Defendant’s failure to file an Opposition. (Reply, at p. 1.)
 
II.                
Procedural
Issues
 
The Court notes that Plaintiff
utilizes copious amounts of secondary source material throughout the moving
papers. While legal authority is also included in the moving papers in
substantial compliance with the Code of Civil Procedure, the Court cautions
Plaintiff from relying on secondary sources in lieu of legal authority in the
future.
 
III.             
Legal
Standard 
 
Discovery Requests
 
A party must respond to
interrogatories and requests for production of documents within 30 days after
service. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260, subd. (a), 2031.260, subd. (a).) If a
party to whom interrogatories or requests for production of documents are
directed does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for
an order compelling responses to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290,
subd. (b), 2031.300, subd. (c).) The party also waives the right to make any
objections, including one based on privilege or work-product protection. (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
 
            Discovery Responses
 
Parties responding to requests for
production “shall respond separately to each item or category of item by any of
the following: (1) [a] statement that the party will comply with the particular
demand … [;] (2) [a] representation that the party lacks the ability to comply
with the demand … [; or] (3) [a]n objection to the particular demand.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.210, subd. (a).)
 
Responses to interrogatories must be
“as complete and straightforward as the information reasonably available to the
responding party permits.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.220, subd. (a).) If an
interrogatory cannot be answered completely, then it must be answered to the
extent possible. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.220, subd. (b).) “If the responding
party does not have personal knowledge sufficient to respond fully to an
interrogatory, that party shall so state, but shall make a reasonable and good
faith effort to obtain the information by inquiry to other natural persons or
organizations, except where the information is equally available to the
propounding party.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.220, subd. (c).)
 
Motions to Compel Further Responses 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2031.310, subdivision (a), provides that “[o]n receipt of a response to a
demand for inspection … the demanding party may move for an order compelling
further response to the demand if the demanding party deems that any of the
following apply:  (1) [a] statement of
compliance with the demand is incomplete[;] (2) [a] representation of inability
to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive[; or] (3) [a]n objection in the
response is without merit or too general.” 

 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2030.300, subdivision (a), provides that “[o]n receipt of a response to
interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order compelling a
further response if the propounding party deems that any of the following apply:
(1) [a]n answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete [;] (2)
[a]n exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is
unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate [;
or] (3) [a]n objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general.” 
 
            Notice of the motions must be given
within 45 days of service of the verified response, otherwise, the propounding
party waives any right to compel a further response. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.310,
subd. (c), 2030.300, subd. (c).) 
 
The motions must also be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2031.310, subd. (b)(2), 2030.300, subd. (b)(1).)   
 
            Finally, California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345 requires
that all motions or responses involving further discovery contain a separate
statement with the text of each request, the response, and a statement of
factual and legal reasons for compelling further responses. (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1345, subd. (a)(3)). 
 
IV.             
Discussion
 
A.     Meet and Confer 
 
Plaintiff submitted evidence that Plaintiff’s counsel
attempted to meet and confer with Defendant to no avail. (RPD Hakim Decl., ¶¶ 7-8,
Exhs. 3.1-3.27; FROGs Hakim Decl., ¶¶ 7-11, Exhs. 3.1-3.27.) 
 
Plaintiff properly submitted a meet and confer
declaration accompanying the motions. The Court finds the meet and confer
process sufficient.  
 
B.     Motion to Compel Further Responses to Request
for Production
 
Plaintiff moves to compel responses to two requests for
production. (RPD Motion, pp. 3-4.)
 
On April 24, 2024, Plaintiff served its Request for
Production of Documents on Defendant. (RPD Sep. Statement, p. 16.)  The two requests at issue here are Request
Nos. 1 and 3, which seek all statements from Defendant in this action and all
mobile phone records for each mobile phone used by Defendant up to 10 minutes
before the time of the accident at issue. (RPD Sep. Statement, pp. 16-17, 22-23;
RPD Hakim Decl., Exh. 1.10-1.17.) 
 
In response to Request No. 1,
Defendant stated: “Objection. Responding party objects to this request on the
ground that it is premature and seeks information that it is protected from
disclosure by the attorney-client and attorney-work product privileges. To the
extent that there are written or recorded statements by the defendant in this
action, they were taken in anticipation of litigation and will not be produced.  Responding party’s ACP/AWP Privilege
Log:  Defendant, Collette Macarthur’s
transcribed statement of the INCIDENT, taken by a representative of Farmers
Insurance Exchange, on or around January 26, 2022.”  (RPD Sep. Statement, pp. 16-17; RPD Hakim
Decl., Exh. 1.1.) 
 
In response to Request No. 3, Defendant
stated: “This responding defendant objects to the demand on the grounds that it
is vague and ambiguous. Overly broad in time and scope. Assumes facts not in
evidence. Seeks information protected by the right to privacy of non-parties to
this action and is not relevant or reasonably calculated to lead to discovery
of admissible evidence as defendant was not on his phone at the time of the
incident.” (RPD Sep. Statement, pp. 16-17; RPD Hakim Decl., Exh. 1.3.)
 
            Here, Plaintiff
served the Request for Production on April 24, 2024, and Defendant failed to
respond to the requests within 30 days of service, despite frequent email
correspondence between the parties and extensions of time to respond.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a).) Defendant
responded on August 6, 2024, months after the response deadline. 
 
Thus, Defendant waived the right to
make any objections, including ones based on privilege or work-product
protection, by failing to timely respond to the request. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subd. (a).) 
 
            While the Court may grant relief
from such waiver, Defendant has not filed the requisite papers for the Court to
consider such action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) 
 
            Accordingly, Plaintiff’s unopposed
Motion to Compel Defendant to provide responses to Requests for Production
requests Nos. 1 and 3 is GRANTED. Defendant is to provide further verified responses
without objections within 30 days. 
 
C.     Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form
Interrogatories 
 
Plaintiff moves to compel responses to seven form
interrogatories. (FROGs Motion, p. 4.) 
 
On April 24, 2024, Plaintiff served
Form Interrogatories, Set No. 1, on Defendant. (FROGs Sep. Statement, p. 16;
FROGs Hakim Decl., Exh. 2.) The interrogatories at issue are Form Interrogatory
Nos. 102.1, 102.5, 102.7, 112.1, 112.2, 112.3, and 120.4. Defendant objected to
Form Interrogatories Nos. 102.5 and 102.7 and provided partial responses to
Form Interrogatories Nos. 102.1, 112.1, 112.2, 112.3, and 120.4. 
 
Form Interrogatories Nos. 102.5 and
102.7
 
Form Interrogatory No. 102.5 seeks the
name, address, and telephone number of each employer Defendant has had over the
last five years and the dates Defendant worked for each. In response, Defendant
stated:  “Objection. The interrogatory is
not reasonably calculated to lead to discoverable information admissible at
trial and is also a violation of Defendant's right to privacy pursuant to
California Constitution, article I, section 1. (Valley Bank of Nevada v.
Superior Court (1975) 15 Cal.3d 652, 656 [125 Cal.Rptr. 553, 555]).” (FROGs
Sep. Statement, p. 20.) 
 
Form Interrogatory No. 102.7 seeks the
name and address of each academic or vocational school Defendant has attended,
beginning with high school, and the dates Defendant attended each. In response,
Defendant stated: “Objection. The interrogatory is not reasonably calculated to
lead to discoverable information admissible at trial and is also a violation of
Defendant's right to privacy pursuant to California Constitution, article I,
section 1. (Valley Bank of Nevada v. Superior Court (1975) 15 Cal.3d 652, 656
[125 Cal.Rptr. 553, 555]).” (FROGs Sep. Statement, p. 21.)
 
Here, Plaintiff propounded Form Interrogatories, Set One,
on April 24, 2024, and Defendant failed to respond to the interrogatories
within 30 days of service, despite frequent email correspondence between the
parties and extensions of time to respond. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a).) Defendant responded on August 7,
2024, months after the response deadline. Thus, Defendant waived the right to
make any objections, including ones based on privilege or work-product
protection, by failing to timely respond to the requests. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).) Leach v. Sup. Ct. (Markum) (1980) 111 Cal. App. 3d
902.  
            While the Court may grant relief
from such waiver, Defendant has not filed the requisite papers for the Court to
consider such action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) 
 
Form Interrogatories Nos. 102.1,
112.1, 112.2, 112.3, and 120.4
 
Form Interrogatory No. 102.1 seeks Defendant’s name, any
other names by which he has been known, and address. In response, Defendant
stated: “Collette Macarthur, who may be reached via her attorney of record.” (FROGs
Sep. Statement, p. 19.) 
 
Form Interrogatory No. 112.1 seeks the
name, address, and telephone number of each individual who has knowledge of
facts relating to the incident and specify his or her area of knowledge. In
response, Defendant stated: “Plaintiff, Defendant, and Susan Dickey, 626-589-6354,
address is not known to responding party. Investigation and discovery are
ongoing and reserve their right to supplement this interrogatory if the facts
so warrant.” (FROGs Sep. Statement, p. 22.)   
 
Form Interrogatory No. 112.2 seeks the
name, address, and telephone number of each individual who gave a written or
recorded statement relating to the incident, and the date of the statement. In
response, Defendant stated: “Plaintiff, Defendant, and Susan Dickey,
626-589-6354; Plaintiff Usvaldo Llamas, 01/26/2022, provided a telephonic
statement to a representative of Farmers Insurance Exchange. Investigation and
discovery are ongoing and reserve their right to supplement this interrogatory
if the facts so warrant.” (FROGs Sep. Statement, p. 23.)

            Form Interrogatory No. 112.3
seeks the name, address, and telephone number of each person who has the
original or a copy of a written or recorded statement relating to the incident.
In response, Defendant stated: “Responding party has copies of the transcribed
statements in their possession.” (FROGs Sep. Statement, p. 24.)
 
Form Interrogatory No. 120.4 seeks the
name, address, and telephone number of each occupant other than the driver. In
response, Defendant stated: “As to responding party, she was driving her
vehicle, with her boyfriend and daughter in their vehicle. Information
regarding propounding party is known to plaintiff.” (FROGs Sep. Statement, p.
25.)
 
Here, the Court finds Defendant’s
responses to be evasive or incomplete as to each challenged interrogatory.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a)(1).) 
For Interrogatory No. 102.1, Defendant does not provide her full address.
For Interrogatory No. 112.2, Defendant does not specify who “Susan Dickey” is
or Susan’s area of knowledge; Defendant also does not include information regarding
her “boyfriend and daughter,” who were in the vehicle at the time of the
incident, as noted in Form Interrogatory No. 120.4. For Interrogatory Nos. 112.3
and 120.4, Defendant does not provide the requested information and instead
provides general references.
             
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s unopposed Motion to
Compel Defendant to provide responses to Form Interrogatory Nos. 102.1, 102.5,
102.7, 112.1, 112.2, 112.3, and 120.4 is GRANTED. 
 
            B. Sanctions 
            
            Plaintiff
requests monetary sanctions totaling $6,154 for the time spent in preparation
and attendance at the hearings of these motions. (Notice of RPD Motion, p.2;
RPD Hakim Decl., ¶ 12;
Notice of FROGs Motion, p.2; FROGs Hakim Decl., ¶
12.)
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision (a)
provides, in pertinent part, that the court may impose a monetary sanction on a
party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process to pay the reasonable
expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that
conduct. A misuse of the discovery process includes making an unmeritorious
objection to discovery and making an evasive response to discovery. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (e), (f).) 
 
The Court finds Defendant’s unmeritorious objections and
incomplete responses to Plaintiff’s discovery requests a misuse of the
discovery process. 
 
Plaintiff’s counsel requests monetary sanctions of
$3,077, per motion.  
 
Plaintiff is entitled to an award of monetary sanctions
against Defendant. However, Plaintiff is only entitled to reasonable
fees incurred in connection with the motions. 
 
The Court GRANTS sanctions in the total amount of $750 in
sanctions. 
 
V.               
Conclusion
& Order
 
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff’s
unopposed Motions for Order Compelling Defendant to Provide Further
Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Production are
GRANTED. 
 
Defendant is ordered to serve further
verified responses without objections and productions as set forth herein
within thirty (30) days of notice of this Court’s order. 
 
Plaintiff’s unopposed request
for Monetary Sanctions is also GRANTED as to both motions in the reduced total amount
of $750, payable to Plaintiff’s counsel by Defendant and Defendant’s counsel,
jointly and severally, within 30 days of this Court’s order.  
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice
of ruling.
