The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in advance of a three-day bench trial. The case appears to be ready for trial, and the Judge has received joint documents from the parties. The Judge has ordered the parties to provide notebooks with FSC materials and exhibit binders, as well as copies of deposition transcripts of witnesses. The Judge has also continued the trial from 10:30 am to 1:30 pm and will proceed in the afternoons until complete. The parties are urged to reach a compromise, and the Judge notes that if the plaintiffs do not prevail, they will have no injunction at all. The defendants are willing to agree to an injunction barring Arturo from living on the property in the future, which leaves only the issue of damages to be resolved.
