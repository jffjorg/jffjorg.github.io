  Case Number:  19SMCV01899    Hearing Date:   July 8, 2024    Dept:  I This is a complaint by a tenant against a landlord alleging
that the unit the tenant rented is uninhabitable.  According to the complaint, Greenberg rented
a unit from Hayek, who was the current landlord’s (Ocean) predecessor.  The lease terminated in January 2005, but
Ocean continued to accept rent, thereby creating a monthly tenancy with
periodic increases.  In September 2021,
Ocean alleges that it stopped accepting rent because it wanted to evict
Greenberg.  Greenberg claims he vacated
the premises on or about December 1, 2023, after a jury returned a verdict in
Ocean’s favor in a UD case.  Ocean
asserts that it was unable to rent certain units until Greenberg moved due to
noise issues.  Ocean also claims that
there was damage to the unit.  Ocean has
cross-complained for damages.  Greenberg
has demurred and Ocean opposes.
 
The demurrer is OVERRULED. 
It is untimely.  The demurrer had
to be filed within the time allowed by law to answer—that is, 30 days after
service (plus any extensions due to the manner of service).  Greenberg was served electronically on April
6, 2024, which made the demurrer due on May 8 at the latest.  It was not filed until May 17.  There is no declaration in the file that
would allow the automatic extension, nor is there an order or stipulation to
that effect.
 
Even were the demurrer timely, it would be OVERRULED.  Ocean has adequately pled its cause of
action.  Greenberg’s theory is that the
cross complaint does not allege that the unit was habitable.  That allegation is unnecessary.  While it is true that providing a unit that
is habitable is the landlord’s responsibility, it need not be alleged
specifically to state a cause of action.
 
Greenberg has 5 court days’ leave to answer.  The court does not expect to see an MJOP on
this issue.
