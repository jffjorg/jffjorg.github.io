 Case Number:  21SMCV01794    Hearing Date:   July 8, 2024    Dept:  I The matter is technically here for an FSC.  However, the court is unsure whether any of
the case survives.  To the extent that
defendants are non-humans, they have no counsel so their answers have been
stricken and they are in default.  To the
extent they are humans, the court will inquire further.  The court notes that certain FSC papers were
filed on July 3, 2024.  Specifically,
plaintiff’s trial brief, exhibit list, and witness list.  Assuming that plaintiff is waiving jury and
defendants do not appear, then perhaps there is a trial.  The court will inquire.
