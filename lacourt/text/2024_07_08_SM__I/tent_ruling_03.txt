 Case Number:  22STCV30200    Hearing Date:   July 8, 2024    Dept:  I The matter is here for an FSC in advance of a three day
bench trial.  On June 28, 2024, the court
received the following documents: (1) Joint Witness List (13 witnesses for a
total of 16.25 hours); (2) Joint Deposition Chart; (3) Joint Exhibit List (84
exhibits, to which there is no objection other than exhibits 4-15); (4) Joint
Statement of Unique Issues; and (5) Plaintiffs’ trial brief.  The case appears to be READY FOR TRIAL.  On the court’s own motion, the trial is
CONTINUED from 10:30 am to 1:30 pm.  It
will go forward in the afternoons until complete. 
 
On the first day of trial, the parties are to provide the
following notebooks: (1) FSC Notebook, consisting of (a) the operative
pleadings (complaint and answer); (b) the FSC materials set forth above; (2)
Exhibit Binder (3 copes) with the exhibits tabbed.  The parties will also bring a copy of all
deposition transcripts of any witness.
 
The court once again urges the parties to try and reach a
compromise here.  Defendants have stated
that they will agree to an injunction barring them from allowing Arturo to live
on the property in the future, which leaves only damages.  The court notes that if plaintiffs do not
prevail, then they will have no injunction at all.
