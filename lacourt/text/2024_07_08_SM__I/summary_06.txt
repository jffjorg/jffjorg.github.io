Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the case, addressing two main issues. The first issue is the measure of damages, specifically whether Triurol is entitled to recover lost revenue due to Farr's breach of the non-compete agreement. The court rules that Dr. Rajfer's testimony and chart are not admissible as evidence, and that the court will not allow the jury to speculate about the profits that Triurol would have made if it had sold the products directly.

The second issue is the interpretation of the contract terms, specifically the meaning of "Quercitin based" and "product containing Quercitin". The court rules that these phrases have similar meanings and that the court will interpret them to mean that the product must contain Quercitin and that the Quercitin must be in the product to provide some therapeutic benefit.

The court also addresses the question of who is liable for breach of the non-compete agreement, ruling that both the individual and Farr are jointly liable if an individual violates the agreement.

Finally, the court notes that the parties' intentions and conduct will be relevant to the case, particularly in determining whether the non-compete agreement was meant to be for show alone or was intended to be enforceable. The court sets the matter for trial and requests that the parties provide additional briefing on the issues raised in the tentative ruling.
