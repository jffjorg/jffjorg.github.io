And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a demurrer (a motion to dismiss) filed by Rockin' Horse, the defendant, in a case involving a sexual assault allegedly committed by Ronald Jeremy, a pornographic celebrity, at Rockin' Horse's establishment. The plaintiff, ROE, alleges that Rockin' Horse is vicariously liable for Jeremy's conduct because of an agency relationship between Jeremy and Rockin' Horse. The judge finds that there is enough evidence to support this allegation, despite the fact that Jeremy is not a typical employee of Rockin' Horse. The judge also finds that Rockin' Horse's alleged knowledge of Jeremy's conduct and its failure to prevent or report it creates an agency relationship. The judge overrules the demurrer and allows the case to proceed. Additionally, the judge denies a motion to strike punitive damages, finding that the allegations in the complaint are sufficient to support such damages.
