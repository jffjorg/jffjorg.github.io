And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling by the judge addresses a complaint by a tenant, Greenberg, against a landlord, Ocean, alleging that the rented unit is uninhabitable. The tenant claims that the landlord continued to accept rent after the lease termination in January 2005, creating a monthly tenancy. Ocean alleges that it stopped accepting rent in September 2021 to evict Greenberg, who claims to have vacated the premises on December 1, 2023. Ocean asserts that it was unable to rent certain units until Greenberg moved due to noise issues and that there was damage to the unit. Greenberg has demurred against Ocean's cross-complaint for damages, but the judge has overruled the demurrer as untimely and unnecessary. Greenberg has five court days to answer the cross-complaint.
