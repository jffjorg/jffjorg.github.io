```

And here is the English text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to compel arbitration. The motion is based on the defendant's claim that they signed the arbitration provision attached to the construction contract, despite the fact that the electronic version did not show a signature. The defendant claims that they signed the hard copy version and returned it to the plaintiffs. However, the plaintiffs claim that they never received a version with the defendant's signature or initials in the arbitration section. The court finds the plaintiffs credible and the defendant not credible, and therefore follows the contract, which states that if the arbitration provision is not signed by all parties, the court must "conclusively" determine that there is no agreement to arbitrate. The motion is denied, and the matter will be stayed for 20 days.
