SUMMARY OF
ACTION
Petitioner Juan
Jose Dario Lopez (Lopez) was a resident of a senior housing facility in
Valencia, California, that was owned and managed by County of Los Angeles
Development Authority (LACDA). Lopez alleges that on June 16, 2023, due to an
unsafe condition at the senior housing facility, he fell down multiple stairs and
suffered severe injuries. The senior housing personnel were promptly notified
of the accident.
 
The time for Lopez
to present his public entity claim to LACDA expired on December 13, 2023, six
months after the incident. Lopez retained counsel on October 10, 2023. On
November 22, 2023, Lopez’s counsel submitted a claim to the Los Angeles County
Board of Supervisors. By letter dated December 14, 2023, the LA County Board of
Supervisors rejected Lopez’s claim and indicated that the claim should have
been presented to a different LA County agency. 
 
On January 9,
2024, Lopez’s counsel applied to LACDA for leave to present a late claim. On
January 10, 2024, Lopez’s counsel received an email confirmation of receipt for
consideration to submit a late claim. By a letter dated January 23, 2024, LACDA
denied Lopez’s request to present a late claim. LACDA’s notice of late claim,
sent on January 24, 2024, stated that they received the claim on January 23,
2024, but Lopez’s counsel had received confirmation of receipt of the claim on
January 10, 2024.
 
Lopez filed
this petition for relief from the claim presentation deadline on April 29,
2024. No opposition has been filed. 
 
ANALYSIS
Gov. Code §
945.4 requires that a claim be presented to a government entity before a
complaint may be filed against the government entity.
 
Gov. Code §
946.6 allows a party to petition the court for an order relieving the
petitioner from Section 945.4 if the application for leave to present a claim
is denied. The petition shall show (1) that application was made to the board
under Section 911.4 and was denied; (2) the reason for failure to present the
claim within the time limit; and (3) the information required by Section 910.
(Gov. Code § 946.6(b).) The court shall relieve the petitioner from the
requirements of Section 945.4 if the application to the board under Section
911.4 was made within a reasonable time not to exceed that specified in Section
911.4(b) (one year after accrual of the cause of action), was denied pursuant
to Section 911.6, and if the failure to present the claim was through mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. (Gov. Code § 946.6(c)(1).)
 
The Petitioner
bears the initial burden of demonstrating, by a preponderance of the evidence,
his entitlement to relief. (Renteria v. Juvenile Justice, Department of
Corrections and Rehabilitation (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 903, 910-911.) The
burden then shifts to the respondent to establish prejudice. (Ramariz v.
County of Merced (1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 684, 689.)
 
The California
Supreme Court has stated that “[t]he remedial policies underlying [late claim
relief] are ‘that wherever possible cases be heard on their merits and any
doubts which may exist should be resolved in favor of the application.’” (Ebersol
v. Cowan (1983) 35 Cal.3d 427, 435.) the late claim relief statutes must be
“construed in favor of relief whenever possible.” (Bettencourt v. Los Rios
Community College Dist. (1986) 42 Cal.3d 270, 275.) “The showing required
of a petitioner seeking relief [to file a late claim] because of mistake,
inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect … is the same as required under
section 473 of the Code of Civil Procedure for relieving a party from a default
judgment. [citations]. Section 473 of the Code of Civil Procedure has been
applied with liberality in relieving parties from their defaults where relief
can be granted without injustice to other parties. [citation]. ‘An order
denying relief runs counter to the law’s policy encouraging trial and
disposition on the merits.’” (Nilsson v. City of Los Angeles (1967) 249
Cal.App.2d 976, 979.)
 
Lopez argues in
his petition that he meets each of the conditions from Gov. Code § 946.6.(c)
for relief. He applied to LACDA for late claim relief pursuant to Section 911.4
within a reasonable time; LACDA denied his application for late claim relief;
and the failure to present a timely claim was due to his attorney’s mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.
 
            Reasonable Time
The reasonable
time under Gov. Code § 946.6 is defined in Gov. Code § 911.4(b) as one year
from the date the claim accrued.
 
Lopez’s cause
of action for negligence would have accrued on the date of the incident on June
16, 2023. Lopez submitted his application for late claim relief to LACDA on
January 9, 2024. That would have been well within the one year time frame from
Sectio 911.4(b).
 
When reviewing
whether a late claim was made within a reasonable time, courts also look to how
much time passed between the date the mistake was realized and the date that
the late application is presented to the public entity. (See Moore v State
of California (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 715, 725-726 [finding that three days
between realizing that a claim was not timely presented and filing the
application for a late claim was reasonable].)
 
In this case,
Lopez’s attorney realized that the claim had been filed with the wrong agency
on January 4, 2024. (Akbarian Decl., ¶¶ 11-12.) Lopez’s attorney then submitted
the request for consideration for late claim on January 9, 2024. This is only 5
days, and the attorney’s prompt presentations was done well within a reasonable
time frame. 
 
            Denial of the Request for
Consideration to Submit Late Claim
The next
requirement under Gov. Code § 946.6(c) is that the public entity must have
denied the application for late claim relief. LACDA denied Lopez’s request for
reconsideration to submit late claim on January 23, 2024.
 
            Attorney’s Excusable Neglect
The final
requirement of Gov. Code § 946.6(c) is that the failure to file a timely claim was
the result of excusable neglect. Where the neglect is by an attorney, as it was
here, controlling California Supreme Court authority instructs that whether the
counsel’s error is ‘excusable’ and therefore subject to relief is determined
by: “(1) the nature of the mistake or neglect; and (2) whether counsel was
otherwise diligent in investigating and pursuing the claim.” (Bettencourt v.
Los Rios Community College Dist. (1986) 42 Cal.3d 270, 276.)
 
“In general,
cases granting relief on the basis of excusable neglect involve plaintiffs who
acted diligently to retain counsel within the [claims] limitation period. It is
usually the neglectful conduct of counsel, or counsel’s staff, imputed to
plaintiff, which is determined to be excusable.” (Ebersol v. Cowan
(1983) 35 Cal.3d 427, 435-436.)
 
In this case,
Lopez hired his counsel on October 10, 2023, well before the claim presentation
deadline. This indicates that Lopez diligently sought representation. Because
Lopez had an attorney, the failure to timely present a claim falls on his
attorney. (See Nilsson v. City of Los Angeles (1967) 249 Cal.App.2d 976;
Kaslavage v. West Kern County Water Dist. (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 529; Flores
v. Board of Supervisors (1970) 13 Cal.App.3d 480.)
 
Lopez’s counsel
indicates that the neglectful conduct was counsel’s failure to file the claim
with the correct agency. The claim, which was filed on November 22, 2023, was
filed with the LA County Board of Supervisors instead of being filed directly with
LACDA. The letter denying the claim on this basis was not delivered to Lopez’s
counsel’s office until after the expiration date of December 16, 2023. Lopez’s
counsel did not see the letter denying the claim until January 4, after she had
come back to the office from vacation. 
 
In this case,
Lopez’s counsel took action, but it was the wrong action. In cases like Kaslavage
and Flores, the parties’ counsel did not take any action because they
had miscalendared or failed to calendar the correct deadline for claim
presentation. Here, Lopez’s counsel was diligent in submitting his claim, but
she simply filed the claim with the wrong agency. She was also diligent in
filing for relief. This is a mistake from which relief may be granted, and the
law favors relief.
 
Lopez has
demonstrated that he is entitled to relief from the requirements of Gov. Code §
945.4. No opposition has been filed by LACDA, so it is unnecessary to address
whether LACDA would be prejudiced by the granting of this petition. 
 
CONCLUSION
Lopez’s petition
is granted. Lopez’s complaint filed on March 5, 2024, is deemed filed.
