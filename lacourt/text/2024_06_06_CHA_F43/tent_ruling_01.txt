SUMMARY OF
ACTION
This action
arises from Plaintiffs Araceli and Anthony Miceli’s (Plaintiffs) purchase of an
allegedly defective 2021 Chevrolet Silverado. On December 14, 2022, Plaintiffs
filed a Complaint against Defendant General Motors, LLC (Defendant) for
violations of the Song-Beverly Act.
 
Plaintiffs
propounded Requests for Production, Set Two, on Defendant on August 25, 2023. On
September 26, 2023, Defendant served its unverified responses to Plaintiffs’
Requests for Production, Set Two. Verification was received on October 25,
2023. Plaintiffs argue that Defendant’s responses were filled with improper
boilerplate objections.
 
On August 25, 2023,
Plaintiffs sent Defendant a meet and confer letter regarding any potential
issues that may arise regarding discovery of electronically stored information.
After Plaintiffs received Defendant’s responses to Set Two, Plaintiffs sent a
second meet and confer letter on October 18, 2023. This letter outlined
Plaintiff’s issues with Defendant’s discovery responses. On November 3, 2023,
Defendant responded to Plaintiffs’ letter and refused to supplement its
responses.
 
Plaintiffs sent
another meet and confer letter on December 5, 2023, but Defendant did not
respond to this letter.
 
On December 13,
2023, Plaintiffs filed this motion to compel further responses to request for production
of documents, Set Two. The specific responses that Plaintiffs allege are
deficient are Defendant’s Responses to RFP Nos. 38-43. Those requests and
responses read as follows:
 
Request for
Production No. 38:
            All DOCUMENTS, including but not
limited to electronically stored information and electronic mails, concerning
or relating to any internal analysis or investigation by YOU or on YOUR behalf
regarding the ENGINE DEFECT in vehicles of the same year, make, and model as
the SUBJECT VEHICLE. [This request shall be interpreted to include, but not be
limited to, any such investigation to determine the root cause of such ENGINE
DEFECT, any such investigation to design a permanent repair procedure for such
ENGINE DEFECT, any such investigation into the failure rates of parts
associated with such ENGINE DEFECT, any cost analysis for implementing a
proposed repair procedures, any savings analysis not implementing a proposed
repair procedures, etc.]
 
Response to
Request for Production No. 38:
            GM objects to this Request on
grounds the terms “concerning,” “internal analysis,” “investigation,” and
“ENGINE DEFECT” are vague and ambiguous. GM also objects to this Request on
grounds it improperly assumes that there are alleged defects with respect to
the SUBJECT VEHICLE, or GM Vehicles, generally. GM also objects to this Request
on grounds it is overbroad and seeks documents that are irrelevant and not
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence as it is
not limited to the SUBJECT VEHICLE at issue in this action. GM also objects to
this Request on grounds it is burdensome and oppressive, and that compliance
would be unreasonably difficult and expensive considering the needs of the
case, the amount in controversy, and the importance of the issues at stake in
the litigation. This is a simple, individual lemon law case with limited issues
and this request violates Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, 61 Cal.Rptr.2d 567. Specifically, whether Plaintiff
is entitled to relief under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act is entirely
unrelated and incommensurate to the scope and breadth of this Request. GM also
objects to this Request to the extent it seeks confidential, proprietary and
trade secret information. GM further objects to this Request to the extent it
seeks information protected by the attorney-client privilege and/or work-product
doctrine. No documents will be produced.
 
Request for
Production No. 39:
            All DOCUMENTS, including but not
limited to electronically stored information and electronic mails, concerning
or relating to any communications YOU have had regarding ENGINE DEFECT in
vehicles of the same year, make, and model as the SUBJECT VEHICLE.
 
Response to
Request for Production No. 39:
            GM objects to this Request on
grounds the terms “concerning or relating to,” “communications,” and “ENGINE
DEFECT” are vague and ambiguous. GM also objects to this Request on grounds it
improperly assumes that there are alleged defects with respect to the SUBJECT
VEHICLE, or GM Vehicles, generally. GM also objects to this Request on grounds
it is overbroad and seeks documents that are irrelevant and not reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence as it is not limited
to the SUBJECT VEHICLE at issue in this action. GM also objects to this Request
on grounds it is burdensome and oppressive, and that compliance would be
unreasonably difficult and expensive considering the needs of the case, the
amount in controversy, and the importance of the issues at stake in the
litigation. This is a simple, individual lemon law case with limited issues and
this request violates Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, 61 Cal.Rptr.2d 567. Specifically, whether Plaintiff
is entitled to relief under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act is entirely
unrelated and incommensurate to the scope and breadth of this Request. GM also
objects to this Request to the extent it seeks confidential, proprietary and
trade secret information. GM further objects to this Request to the extent it
seeks information protected by the attorney-client privilege and/or work-product
doctrine. No documents will be produced.
 
Request for
Production No. 40:
            All DOCUMENTS, including but not
limited to electronically stored information and electronic mails, concerning
or relating to any decision to issue any notices, letters, campaigns, warranty
extensions, technical service bulletins and recalls concerning the ENGINE
DEFECT in vehicles of the same year, make, and model as the SUBJECT VEHICLE.
 
Response to
Request for Production No. 40:
            GM objects to this Request on
grounds the terms “concerning or relating to,” “issue,” and “ENGINE DEFECT” are
vague and ambiguous. GM also objects to this Request on grounds it improperly
assumes that there are alleged defects with respect to the SUBJECT VEHICLE, or
GM Vehicles, generally. GM also objects to this Request on grounds it is overbroad
and seeks documents that are irrelevant and not reasonably calculated to lead
to the discovery of admissible evidence as it is not limited to the SUBJECT
VEHICLE at issue in this action. GM also objects to this Request on grounds it
is burdensome and oppressive, and that compliance would be unreasonably
difficult and expensive considering the needs of the case, the amount in
controversy, and the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation. This
is a simple, individual lemon law case with limited issues and this request
violates Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court (1997) 53
Cal.App.4th 216, 61 Cal.Rptr.2d 567. Specifically, whether Plaintiff is entitled
to relief under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act is entirely unrelated
and incommensurate to the scope and breadth of this Request. GM also objects to
this Request to the extent it seeks confidential, proprietary and trade secret
information. GM further objects to this Request to the extent it seeks
information protected by the attorney-client privilege and/or work-product
doctrine. 
 
Subject
to and without waiving these objections, GM will comply in part and produce the
following documents in its possession, custody and control: copies of the
bulletins for every field action, including any recalls, that GM issued for the
SUBJECT VEHICLE as identified in the image below; and a list of Technical
Service Bulletins (“TSBs”) and a list of Information Service Bulletins (“ISBs”)
for vehicles of the same year, make, and model as the SUBJECT VEHICLE. After it
has produced the lists of TSBs and ISBs, GM will – at Plaintiff’s request –
search for and produce, if located, copies of a reasonable number of TSBs and
ISBs, if any, that Plaintiff has identified as relevant to the conditions
alleged in Plaintiff’s complaint.
 
Request for
Production No. 41:
            All DOCUMENTS, including but not
limited to electronically stored information and electronic mails, concerning
customer complaints, claims, reported failures, and warranty claims related to
ENGINE DEFECT, in vehicles of the same year, make, and model as the SUBJECT
VEHICLE, including but not limited to any databases in YOUR possession with
information from dealers, service departments, parts departments, or warranty
departments, and all documents concerning YOUR response to each complaint,
claim or reported failure.
 
Response to
Request for Production No. 41:
GM
objects to this Request on grounds the terms “concerning,” “customer
complaints,” “claims,” “reported failures,” “warranty claims” “related to” and
“ENGINE DEFECT” are vague and ambiguous. GM also objects to this Request on
grounds it improperly assumes that there are alleged defects with respect to
the SUBJECT VEHICLE, or GM Vehicles, generally. GM also objects to this Request
on grounds it is overbroad and seeks documents that are irrelevant and not
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence as it is
not limited to the SUBJECT VEHICLE at issue in this action. GM also objects to

objects to this Request to the extent it seeks confidential, proprietary and
trade secret information. GM further objects to this Request to the extent it
seeks information protected by the attorney-client privilege and/or
work-product doctrine. No documents will be produced.
 
Request for
Production No. 42:
            All DOCUMENTS, including but not
limited to electronically stored information and electronic mails, concerning
failure rates of vehicles of the same year, make, and model as the SUBJECT
VEHICLE as a result of ENGINE DEFECT.
 
Response to
Request for Production No. 42:
            GM objects to this Request on

and ambiguous. GM also objects to this Request on grounds it improperly assumes

Request for
Production No. 43:
            All DOCUMENTS, including but not
limited to electronically stored information and electronic mails, concerning
or relating to any fixes for ENGINE DEFECT in vehicles of the same year, make,
and model as the SUBJECT VEHICLE.
 
Response to
Request for Production No. 43:
            GM objects to this Request on
grounds the terms “concerning,” “relating to,” “fixes” and “ENGINE DEFECT” are
vague and ambiguous. GM also objects to this Request on grounds it improperly

            The Parties’ Arguments
In their
motion, Plaintiffs argue that Defendant waived all objections to the requests.
Next, Plaintiff argues that Defendant’s refusal to provide meaningful,
substantive responses evinces a lack of good faith. Finally, Plaintiffs argue
that their requests are relevant to their Song-Beverly claims.
 
In opposition,
Defendant first argues that Plaintiffs failed to sufficiently meet and confer
in good faith. Next, Defendant argues that the Court should sustain Defendant’s
well-founded objections on the basis that Defendant does not have to produce
information about similar occurrences of the defects in the same year, make,
and model vehicles; and Plaintiffs’ request impermissibly seek trade secret
material and other protected information.
 
No reply has
been filed.
 
ANALYSIS
The Discovery
Act allows “[a]ny party [to] obtain discovery . . . by inspecting, copying,
testing, or sampling documents . . . and electronically stored information in
the possession, custody, or control of any other party to the action.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.010, subd. (a).) The demanding party may designate the
documents sought “by reasonably particularizing each category of item.” (CCP §
2031.030(c)(1).) The responding party must then “respond separately to each
item or category of item” with an agreement to comply, representation of
inability to comply, or an objection. (CCP § 2031.210.) If the demanding party
deems that “(1) [a] statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete,” (2)
“[a] representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or
evasive.” (3) “[a]n objection in the response is without merit or too general,”
the demanding party may seek an order compelling code-complaint responses. (CCP
§ 2030.310(a).)
 
Plaintiffs
argue in their motion that they engaged in sufficient meet and confer by
sending the letters to Defendant. Defendant disputes the sufficiency of the
meet and confer efforts. However, based on the parties’ moving papers, it
appears that further meet and confer would have been futile. The Court will
address the requests for production at issue.
 
Next, CCP §
2031.240 states that two requirements must be satisfied for a responding party
to properly object to a demand. First, a party must “[i]dentify with
particularity any document, [or] tangible thing . . . to which an objection is
being made.” (CCP § 2031.240(b)(1).) Second, a party must “[s]et forth clearly
the extent of, and the specific ground for, the objection.” (CCP §
2031.240(b)(2).) Furthermore, a party who fails to serve timely responses to a
demand for inspection waives objections to the request. (CCP § 2031.300(a).)
That being said, a court may relieve a party from this waiver if a party has
subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with the Code.
(CCP § 2031.300(a)(1).)
 
For Request Nos.
38, 39, 41, 42, and 43, the main question is whether they are relevant and
likely to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. As the Court found with
Plaintiffs’ previous motion to compel further discovery responses, this is a
Song-Beverly action specifically about the defects in Plaintiffs’ vehicle, not
other customers’ vehicles. The information about other customers’ vehicles is
not relevant to this action. No further responses to these requests are
necessary.
 
The Court would
also refer the parties to the Court’s lemon law discovery order, available on
the Court’s website. The Court has a list of documents that are acceptable for
production during discovery. The Court’s list includes complaints from other
customers for defects that are substantially similar to the ones complained of
by Plaintiffs in vehicles of the same make, model, and year as Plaintiffs’
vehicle. While Plaintiffs’ Request No. 41 mentions complaints related to the
engine defect, Plaintiffs’ Request is much broader that the one on the Court’s
list because it includes claims, reported failures, and warranty claims. Plaintiffs’
Request No. 41 is therefore overbroad. The items requested in Plaintiffs’
Request Nos. 38, 39, 42, and 43 are not on the Court’s list, and therefore
outside the bounds of acceptable requests for production for a lemon law case. 
 
As for Request
No. 40, subject to some objections, Defendant has agreed to produce a list of bulletins
for every field action, technical service bulletins, and information service
bulletins for vehicles of the same year, make, and model, and then allow
Plaintiffs to indicate from that list which specific bulletins they wish to
obtain. This appears to be a reasonable response and narrows the focus of the
discovery request for both parties. The Court will not compel a further
response to this request unless Defendant fails to produce the list of
bulletins.
 
Plaintiffs’ motion
to compel further discovery responses is denied for Request Nos. 38 through 43.
 
ORDER
1.      Plaintiffs’
motion to compel further responses is denied.
