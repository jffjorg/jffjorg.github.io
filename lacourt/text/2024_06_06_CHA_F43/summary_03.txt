```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled that the demurrer to the plaintiffs' second cause of action for wrongful death is sustained without leave to amend. This means that the plaintiffs did not timely file their wrongful death claim, and the claim is barred by the statute of limitations. The judge also ruled that the motion to strike the plaintiffs' request for punitive damages is moot, as the plaintiffs have already dismissed their request for punitive damages. The judge's decision is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and various California court decisions.
