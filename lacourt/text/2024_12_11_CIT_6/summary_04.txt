And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff, American Express National Bank, filed a debt collection case against the defendant, Javier Ramirez, and alleged that the defendant failed to timely respond or appear. The plaintiff requested entry of default judgment against the defendant, but the judge found that the default judgment package contained some defects. Specifically, the plaintiff did not provide sufficient evidence to support the amount of damages requested, and it was unclear where the amount of credit acknowledgment came from. Therefore, the judge denied the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment without prejudice, allowing the plaintiff to re-file the request and provide the necessary evidence.
