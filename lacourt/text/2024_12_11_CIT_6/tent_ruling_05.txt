NAME:  Keanna
Cecilia Camberos v. Demitric Gomez Lomeli, et al. 
Motion
of Jeffrey L. Fayngor to be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff Keanna Cecilia
Camberos 
TENTATIVE
RULING 
The Court DENIES the motion of Jeffrey L. Fayngor to be relieved
as counsel for Plaintiff Keanna Cecilia Camberos without prejudice. 
              Counsel Jeffrey L. Fayngor is
ordered to give notice of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this
order. 
BACKGROUND 
This is a personal injury action. On August 5, 2024, plaintiff Keanna
Cecilia Camberos (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants Demitric
Gomez Lomeli, Irma Lomeli Frias (collectively, Defendants) and Does 1 through
20, alleging one cause of action for motor vehicle accident negligence. 
On November 18, 2024, counsel Jeffrey L. Fayngor of The JLF Firm
moved to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff. The motion is unopposed. 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
The Court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted, provided that there is no prejudice to the client, and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 403-407.)
A motion to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Council
Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053
(Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) The requisite forms must be served “on the client and on all
parties that have appeared in the case.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362,
subd. (d).) 
DISCUSSION 
            Jeffrey L.
Fayngor of The JLF Firm (Counsel) seeks to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff
on the grounds that there has been a breakdown in the attorney-client
relationship. (Fayngor Decl., ¶ 2.)The Court finds sufficient grounds for permitting withdrawal here.
A breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is grounds for allowing the
attorney to withdraw. (Estate of Falco (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004,
1014.) Grounds for permitting an attorney to withdraw from representation also
include the client’s conduct that, “renders it unreasonably difficult for the
lawyer to carry out the representation effectively[.]” (Cal. Rules of
Professional Conduct, rule 1.16, subd. (b)(4).) 
Counsel has submitted the application, declaration, and proposed
order on Judicial Council forms MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053, as required. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) 
            However, Counsel
mail served the motion, which means the deadline to file and serve the motion
was November 12, 2024. (Proof of Service (11/18/24), ¶ 6, subd. (b); Code Civ.
Proc., § 1005, subd. (b)(5).) Counsel did not serve the motion until November
14, 2024, and did not file it until November 18, 2024. (See Proof of Service
(11/18/24), ¶ 4.) Counsel’s motion is again untimely. (See Order re Tentative
Ruling (10/28/24).) 
            The Court also
notes that Counsel did not serve a copy of the proposed order on  Plaintiff. (See Proof of Service (11/18/24), ¶
4; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subd. (d) [copy of proposed order must be
served with moving papers on client and all parties].) The Court further notes
that Counsel’s supporting declaration contradicts itself by claiming to have
confirmed Plaintiff's last known address by mail return receipt requested and
then claiming to have been unable to confirm that it is current. (Fayngor
Decl., ¶ 3, subds. (b)(1)(a), (b)(2)(a).) 
            Based on the
foregoing, the Court DENIES the motion without prejudice. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES the motion of Jeffrey L. Fayngor to be relieved
as counsel for Plaintiff Keanna Cecilia Camberos without prejudice. 
              Counsel Jeffrey L. Fayngor is
ordered to give notice of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this
order.
