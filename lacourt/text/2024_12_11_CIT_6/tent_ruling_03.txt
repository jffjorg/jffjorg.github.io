[1] The Court notes that Plaintiff’s counsel’s
declaration does not set forth the amount of time expended in seeking
Defendant’s compliance and in preparing this motion, but instead requests
monetary sanctions in the lump sum of $5,316.25. (Gonzalez Decl., ¶¶ 10-11, 16;
[8:2145] Sanctions for Failure to Obey Court Order:, Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro.
Before Trial Ch. 8M-5 [stating that declarations seeking monetary sanctions
should include the time and expense incurred in attempting to obtain compliance
and preparing the motion].) The Court therefore bases its calculation on the
Court’s May 1, 2024 order, in which it awarded Plaintiff monetary sanctions at
the reduced hourly rate of $500.00. (Order re Tentative Ruling (5/1/24).)
