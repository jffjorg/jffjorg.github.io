And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for monetary sanctions against the defendant for failing to comply with a court order. The plaintiff's counsel has submitted a declaration requesting $5,316.25 in sanctions, but did not provide information on the time and expense incurred in seeking compliance and preparing the motion. The court notes that this is a required detail, as stated in Civil Procedure Before Trial Chapter 8M-5. Instead, the court will base its calculation on its previous order on May 1, 2024, which awarded monetary sanctions at a reduced hourly rate of $500.00.
