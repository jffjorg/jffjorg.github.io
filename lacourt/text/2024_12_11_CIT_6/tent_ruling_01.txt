Yu Min Chen 1.      Plaintiff  City of El Monte’s Motion to Compel Defendant Gary Huang’s Responses to First  Set of Form Interrogatories, and Monetary Sanctions in the Amount of $825; and 2.      Plaintiff  City of El Monte’s Motion to Compel Defendant Gary Huang’s Responses to First  Set of Requests for Production of Documents, and Monetary Sanctions in the  Amount of $825  TENTATIVE  RULING  The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motions to compel. Defendant Gary  Huang must provide  verified code-compliant responses, including responsive documents, without  objection, to Plaintiff’s First Sets of Form Interrogatories and Requests for  Production of Documents within 20 days of the Court’s order.  The  Court further GRANTS Plaintiff’s requests for monetary sanctions in the total  amount of $1100.00. Defendant Huang must pay said monetary sanctions to counsel  for Plaintiff within 20 days of the Court’s order.              Plaintiff is ordered to give notice  of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.  BACKGROUND  This is an  abatement action. On March 16, 2022, plaintiff City of El Monte (Plaintiff)  filed this action against defendant Yu Min Chen (Chen) and Does 1 through 100,  alleging causes of action for narcotics abatement, public nuisance, violation  of El Monte Municipal Code, violation of Unfair Competition Law,  and violation of MAUCRSA. On September 26, 2023, Plaintiff filed Doe amendments  naming Gary Huang (Huang) and Marilyn Moda, Inc. (Marilyn Moda) as defendants.   On March 1, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed  Chen from this action with prejudice. On March 20, 2024, Huang answered the  complaint.  On November 15, 2024, Plaintiff moved to compel responses to  written discovery requests from Defendant Huang. The motions are unopposed.  LEGAL  STANDARD  When a party fails to serve a timely response  to interrogatories, the party propounding the interrogatories may move for an  order compelling a response. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) A party  who fails to provide a timely response waives any objection, including one  based on privilege or work product. (Ibid., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) “The  court shall impose a monetary sanction… against any party, person, or attorney  who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories,  unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial  justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction  unjust.” (Ibid., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)   When a party fails to serve a timely response  to an inspection demand, the party making the demand may move for an order  compelling a response to the inspection demand. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,  subd. (b).) A party who fails to provide a timely response waives any  objection, including one based on privilege or work product. (Ibid., §  2031.300, subd. (a).) “[T]he court shall impose a monetary sanction… against  any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to  compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling,  unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial  justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction  unjust.” (Ibid., § 2031.300, subd. (c).)  DISCUSSION  Meet and Confer  Although meeting and conferring is not required before bringing  motions to compel, the Court still requests that parties meet and confer in  person, by telephone, or by video conference before bringing any motions. (Jungk  Decls., ¶¶ 6-7; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare  Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404; Dept. 6 Courtroom  Information.)              Analysis  Plaintiff  seeks to compel Defendant Huang to provide responses to First Sets of Form  Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents, which Plaintiff  served on Huang on May 3, 2024. (Jungk Decls., ¶ 5.) Plaintiff indicates no  responses have been received. (Jungk Decls., ¶ 8.) The Court finds Plaintiff’s  motions well taken and will GRANT them. Defendant Huang must provide verified  code-compliant responses, including responsive documents, without objection, to  Plaintiff’s First Sets of Form Interrogatories and Requests for Production of  Documents within 20 days of the Court’s order.  The  Court further GRANTS Plaintiff’s requests for monetary sanctions in the reduced  amount of $550.00 per motion, comprised of 1.0 hour preparing each motion and  1.0 hour for attending the hearing on each motion, for a total of 2.0 hours,  multiplied by the hourly rate of $275.00, for a grand total of $1100.00.  Defendant must pay said monetary sanctions to counsel for Plaintiff within 20  days of the Court’s order.  CONCLUSION  The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motions to compel. Defendant Gary  Huang must provide  verified code-compliant responses, including responsive documents, without  objection, to Plaintiff’s First Sets of Form Interrogatories and Requests for  Production of Documents within 20 days of the Court’s order.  The  Court further GRANTS Plaintiff’s requests for monetary sanctions in the total  amount of $1100.00. Defendant Huang must pay said monetary sanctions to counsel  for Plaintiff within 20 days of the Court’s order.              Plaintiff is ordered to give notice  of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.Plaintiff  City of El Monte’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment Defendant: Marilyn Moda, Inc. TENTATIVE RULING           Plaintiff’s request for entry of  default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.           BACKGROUND           This is an  abatement action. On March 16, 2022, plaintiff City of El Monte (Plaintiff)  filed this action against defendant Yu Min Chen (Chen) and Does 1 through 100,  alleging causes of action for narcotics abatement, public nuisance, violation  of El Monte Municipal Code, violation of Unfair Competition Law,  and violation of MAUCRSA. On September 26, 2023, Plaintiff filed Doe amendments  naming Gary Huang (Huang) and Marilyn Moda, Inc. (Marilyn Moda) as defendants.  On March 1,  2024, Plaintiff dismissed Chen from this action with prejudice. On March 20,  2024, Huang answered the complaint.[1] On February  15, 2024, default was entered against Marilyn Moda. On November 13,  2024, Plaintiff filed a default judgment package against Marilyn Moda.           LEGAL  STANDARD Code of  Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party  has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party  seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court  Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other  admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest  computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration  of nonmilitary status; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all  parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate  judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of  grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for  attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal.  Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.) ANALYSIS Plaintiff seeks  default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $6,855,274.83,  including $6,782,600.00 in damages, $69,716.60 in attorney fees, and $4,958.23 in  costs. The Court finds a few issues with Plaintiff’s default judgment package.  First, Plaintiff did not dismiss the Doe defendants. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule  3.1800, subd. (a)(7).) Second, Plaintiff did not submit an application for a  separate judgment against Marilyn Moda supported by a showing of grounds for  such a separate judgment. (Ibid.; Code Civ. Proc., § 579.) It also  appears to the Court that Huang and Marilyn Moda might be jointly liable which  would prohibit the Court from entering a judgment against Marilyn Moda while  Huang proceeds in this action. (Mirabile v. Smith (1953) 119 Cal.App.2d  685, 688-689; see also Le  Sage v. Title Guarantee & Tr. Co.  (1939) 12 Cal.2d 531, 534 [trust company acting as trustee held jointly liable  with promoters of fraudulent securities scheme].) There is also the issue of  Chen having settled this matter separately for only $40,000. (Stipulation for  Entry of Judgment Pursuant to Settlement Agreement (10/10/24).) Third, the $4,500.00 in police enforcement costs Plaintiff  seeks are not recoverable as costs under Code of Civil Procedure section  1033.5. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5.) The $4,500.00 in police enforcement  costs Plaintiff seeks under the El Monte Municipal Code are actually damages,  notwithstanding the language of “costs” contained in the statutory language.  (See El Monte Municipal Code, §§ 1.19.020, 5.18.370.) For Plaintiff to recover  these law enforcement costs, Plaintiff needed to have included them in the  complaint as damages. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 580, subd. (a) [relief granted to  a plaintiff upon entry of a defendant’s default cannot exceed the amount  demanded in the complaint].) CONCLUSION                       Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s request  for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.  [1] Default had been entered against Huang at one point, but Plaintiff and Huang  stipulated to setting aside the entry of default. (Stipulation to Set Aside  Default and Order Thereon (2/29/24).)
