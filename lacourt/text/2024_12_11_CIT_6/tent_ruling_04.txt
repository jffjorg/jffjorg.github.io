 Case Number:  23PSCV03704    Hearing Date:   December 11, 2024    Dept:  6 Plaintiff
American Express National Bank’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment 
Defendant: Javier Ramirez 
TENTATIVE RULING 
            Plaintiff’s
request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.           
BACKGROUND           
            This
is a debt collection case. On November 29, 2023, plaintiff American Express
National Bank (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendant Javier Ramirez
(Defendant) and Does 1 through 10, alleging one cause of action for common
counts. 
On November
13, 2024, default was entered against Defendant. 
On November
13, 2024, Plaintiff requested entry of default judgment against Defendant.           
LEGAL
STANDARD 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party
has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party
seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court
Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other
admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest
computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration
of nonmilitary status; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all
parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate
judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for
attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.) 
ANALYSIS 
Plaintiff
seeks default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $29,887.97,
including $29,384.97 in damages and $503.00 in costs. The Court finds the
default judgment package contains some defects, namely that Plaintiff did not
submit sufficient evidence to support the amount of damages requested. While
the complaint alleges Defendant accrued debt under two different credit card
accounts, Plaintiff only submitted a copy of a statement for the credit card
account ending in 1008, which shows a total of $16,251.27 outstanding. (Hinds
Decl., Ex. B; Compl., Exs. A, B.) It is also unclear to the Court where the
$631.93 in credit acknowledgment comes from. (CIV-100, ¶ 2, subd. (a).) The
Court further notes that the amount listed in paragraph 2, subdivision (a), regarding
amount demanded in complaint does not match the amount demanded in the
complaint. (Compl., ¶ 10, subd. (a).) 
CONCLUSION           
            Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s request
for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
