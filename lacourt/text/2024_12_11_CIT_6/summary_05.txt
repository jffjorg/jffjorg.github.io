```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in plain English:

The judge has denied Jeffrey L. Fayngor's motion to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff Keanna Cecilia Camberos without prejudice. This means that Fayngor can still reapply to withdraw as counsel, but he must give notice of the court's ruling within five calendar days. The judge's decision is based on several factors, including the fact that Fayngor's motion was filed late and that he did not serve a copy of the proposed order on Camberos. Additionally, the judge notes that Fayngor's supporting declaration contradicts itself and that there may be a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The judge is giving Fayngor another chance to correct these issues before making a final decision.
