Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has made the following tentative rulings on the present motions:

* Weishi Xie's motion to amend the judgment is denied without prejudice because Xie failed to provide proof of service on other parties.
* Weishi Xie's motion to enforce protections is denied without prejudice because Xie failed to provide evidence that establishes the funds levied included Social Security funds.
* He's claim of exemption is denied without prejudice because He did not file the proper claim for exemption.
* Agnes Nwapa-Jourdan's motion to quash the service of summons and vacate the entry of default judgment is continued to a date to be determined at the hearing presently set in Department G (Pomona) because the proof of service appears valid on its face, but Nwapa-Jourdan provides a declaration denying ever receiving personal service of summons.

The court will continue to hear arguments on these motions at the next hearing date.
