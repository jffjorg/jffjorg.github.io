And here is a summary in English text of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has granted Plaintiff Mingming Huo's motion for leave to file a first amended complaint (FAC). The FAC removes the Estate of Yang Zhao from the action, alleges that Yuquing Ai is Yang Zhao's personal representative, removes a request for punitive damages, and adds additional facts to support Huo's claims for damages and breach of duty. The Judge found that Huo established good cause for the amendment, as Huo's counsel first discovered the status of Zhao's estate on June 11, 2024, and was unable to obtain a stipulation from Ai's counsel. The Judge also noted that Ai failed to file a timely opposition to the motion. The Judge ordered Huo to file the proposed FAC with the court forthwith.
