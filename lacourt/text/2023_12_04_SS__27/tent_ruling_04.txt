[1] Swank contends that the Court
granted the motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff’s experts on September
18, 2023; however, this is incorrect as the Court granted the motion on
September 19, 2023. 


[2] The Court notes that in regard to
the Demurrer it has heard various arguments regarding whether or not Defendant
has been served and whether or not Defendant has, in any event, made a general
appearance in this action.  Unfortunately,
for the second time, neither party has provided the Court with the specific
evidence on that issue that both parties have mentioned, namely transcripts of
hearings on September 18, 2023, and September 27, 2023.  Assuming there will be another demurrer, this
time to the Second Amended Complaint, the Court strongly suggests that if evidence
supports a party’s argument, that party provide the Court with that evidence.
