Summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses two issues: the service of the defendant and the deposition of plaintiff's experts. The judge notes that the court granted the motion to compel the deposition on September 19, 2023, not September 18, 2023, as claimed by Swank. The judge also expresses frustration that neither party has provided evidence to support their arguments regarding service, despite mentioning specific hearings on September 18 and 27, 2023. The judge suggests that if evidence supports a party's argument, they should provide it to the court.
