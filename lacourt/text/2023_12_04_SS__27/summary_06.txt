And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to set aside the dismissal of the Complaint filed by Maria Araceli Flores against Bobby Lee Mays and Does 1-50. The Plaintiff failed to appear at the Final Status Conference and Trial, leading to the dismissal of the Complaint on September 14, 2023. The Plaintiff filed a motion to set aside the dismissal on November 9, 2023, which is unopposed. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff satisfied the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b) to have the dismissal set aside, as the Plaintiff's Counsel submits a sworn affidavit attesting to the mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect that led to the Plaintiff's non-appearance. The motion is granted, and the action is reinstated. The Final Status Conference is set for a later date, and the Plaintiff is ordered to file proof of service of the summons and complaint on the Defendants within 30 days.
