And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is regarding a motion for terminating sanctions and a demurrer filed by Defendant Judith Swank. The motion seeks to impose terminating sanctions on Plaintiff Stephen Harris due to his non-compliance with the Court's September 19, 2023 order compelling the deposition of Plaintiff's experts. The demurrer challenges the sufficiency of the pleadings.

The Court notes that Plaintiff has filed multiple complaints, including the original complaint, an amended complaint, and a first amended complaint. The Court grants leave to file a second amended complaint to clarify the basis for bringing the action against Swank, who is representing the estate of Decedent Jack Swank.

The Court denies the request for terminating sanctions due to the pending appeal of the Court's September 19, 2023 order. The Court also grants the demurrer and orders Plaintiff to file a second amended complaint within 20 days.
