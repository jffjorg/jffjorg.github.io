And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendant, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA), in its motion to compel the plaintiff, Mariya Chernyavskaya, to respond to discovery requests. The plaintiff failed to respond to the requests in a timely manner, despite being provided with multiple extensions. The judge finds that the plaintiff's failure to respond is a misuse of the discovery process and orders the plaintiff and her counsel to pay sanctions to the defendant in the amount of $1,800. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's arguments that she did not have technological access and was of a certain age are unpersuasive, as she was able to bring the lawsuit and is responsible for abiding by the rules of discovery. The judge concludes that the plaintiff's request for sanctions against the defendant is "ridiculous" and that the defendant's request for sanctions against the plaintiff is reasonable.
