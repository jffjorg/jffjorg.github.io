And here is the English-text summary:

Judge Lee S. Arian has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to be relieved as counsel filed by defendant's attorney, Brian P. Kamel. Kamel seeks to be relieved due to an irreparable breakdown of the attorney-client relationship and a conflict of interest. The motion complies with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, and the defendant, a corporation, has not filed an opposition to the motion. The court finds that there will be no prejudice to the defendant in granting the motion, as the defendant was given notice of counsel's intent to withdraw on November 3, 2023. The court grants the motion upon the filing of a proof of service by Kamel demonstrating that the defendant was given notice of this ruling. The proof of service and filing are ordered to be completed within 7 calendar days of this ruling.
