      CASE NO.: BC720067
 
[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL 
 
Dept.
  27
1:30
  p.m.
December
  4, 2023



 
Defendant’s attorney of record, Brian
P. Kamel, seeks to be relieved because there has been an irreparable breakdown of
the attorney-client relationship. Moreover, a conflict of interest arose
between the client and attorney. 
Fos a Motion to Withdraw, California
Rule of Court, rule 3.1362 requires (1) a notice of motion and motion to be
directed to the client; (2) a declaration stating in general terms the basis
for the withdrawal, without compromising the confidentiality of the
attorney-client relationship; (3) service of the notice of motion and motion
and declaration on all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the
proposed order relieving counsel. Counsel’s Motion complies with
California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362. Absent a showing of resulting
prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be granted.  (People
v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.) 
Here, trial is currently set for January 24, 2024, with a final status
conference and regular status conference on January10, 2024. 
Defendant has not filed an opposition to
counsel’s motion. 
The Court finds that no prejudice will
result to Defendant in granting the Motion because Defendant is a corporation
which was given notice of counsel’s intent to withdraw on November 3, 2023.  Further, the dates for trial and final status
conference can be changed if necessary to ensure Defendant is not prejudiced by
counsel’s withdrawal 
Thus, the Court GRANTS Counsel’s Motion
to Be Relieved as Counsel upon the filing of a proof of service by Counsel
demonstrating that defendant was given notice of this ruling.   Such proof of service and filing of it is ordered to be completed within 7 calendar days of this ruling.
