CASE:                                Maria Araceli Flores v. Bobby Lee Mays, et al.,
 
CASE NO.:                 22STCV09497
 





















 
MOTION
TO SET ASIDE DISMISSAL



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
Maria Araceli Flores
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On March 17, 2022, Plaintiff, Maria Araceli Flores, filed a Complaint
against Defendants Bobby Lee Mays and Does 1-50 (collectively, “Defendants”)
for injuries arising from a March 20, 2022, motor vehicle accident.  
 
            On September
14, 2023, after Plaintiff failed to appear at the Final Status Conference and
at Trial, the Court dismissed the Complaint pursuant to CCP 581(b)(3).  The Clerk of the Court mailed notice of the
Court’s order on the same day.
 
On November 9, 2023, Plaintiff filed this motion to set aside the dismissal under
CCP 473(b). 
 
The motion is unopposed.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
473 (b) provides that a court may “relieve a party or his or her legal
representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken
against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.” The moving party must file the motion in a timely
manner and provide an attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to his or her
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).)
A motion is timely when it is sought “within a reasonable time, in no case
exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was
taken.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).)
 
III.      DISCUSSION
            
Plaintiff satisfied the
requirements under section 473(b) to have the dismissal set aside. In Flores
v. Board of Supervisors, the court granted the petition for relief
when the plaintiffs’ attorneys filed their claim 23 days late because “calendar
errors by an attorney, or a member of his staff are, under appropriate
circumstances, excusable.” (Flores v. Board of Supervisors (1970) 13
Cal.App.3d 480, 482). Here, Plaintiff’s Counsel submits a sworn affidavit in
compliance with section 437(b) because he states that the new paralegal failed
to calendar the Final Status Conference and Trial dates which resulted in
Plaintiff’s non-appearance. (Gilbert Quiñones Declaration, ¶3). The paralegal’s
failure to calendar the dates was likely due to inadvertence because she was
new to the job. Additionally, Plaintiff’s Counsel filed this motion two months
after the dismissal, which is considered within section 437’s “reasonable time”
standard.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
Based on the foregoing, the motion to set aside the September
14, 2023, dismissal is GRANTED, and the action is reinstated.  
 
The Final Status Conference is set for _________ at 10:00
a.m. in Department 27 of Spring Street Courthouse.  Trial is set for __________
at 8:30 a.m. in Department 27 of Spring Street Courthouse. Plaintiff is
ordered to file proof of service of the summons and complaint on Defendants
within 30 days of notice of this order.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 583.210.)
