And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses a dispute between Swank, the plaintiff, and the defendant regarding the service of the defendant and the defendant's general appearance in the action. The Judge notes that the court granted the defendant's motion to compel the deposition of plaintiff's experts on September 19, 2023, not September 18, 2023 as claimed by the plaintiff. The Judge also criticizes both parties for failing to provide evidence to support their arguments regarding service and general appearance, despite mentioning transcripts of hearings on September 18, 2023, and September 27, 2023. The Judge suggests that if evidence supports a party's argument, that party should provide the evidence in future proceedings.
