[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: PETITION TO CONFIRM MINOR’S COMPROMISE
 
 
Dept.

  p.m.

  4, 2023



 
          Claimant
Justine Hernandez (“Claimant”), a minor, by and through her parent and guardian-ad-litem, Alice Varela (“Petitioner”), agrees to release her
claims against Defendant Magnolia Head Start (“Defendant”) for injuries
Claimant sustained from Defendant’s alleged negligence.  On November 5, 2021, Claimant sustained a
broken elbow from a fall on Defendant’s property. Under the proposed settlement,
Defendant agrees to pay $50,000 to Claimant.  
          Attachment 7c(2)(b)
indicates that the funds are to be deposited into a structured settlement with Quest
Settlements.  The settlement will result
in $22,500 in attorney’s fees to be paid to counsel and $8953.76 in medical
expenses being paid, leaving $18,546.25 to be allotted to the minor.  
          The Court requires
more information to be provided regarding the attorney’s fees.  Specifically, the Court would like to understand
why nearly 50% of the settlement is being used for attorney’s fees in a case
that has settled when most contingency arrangements assign no more than 1/3 to
attorney’s fees if no trial is required. 

          Accordingly,
the hearing on the Petition is continued to XXX and counsel is ordered to file
a declaration explaining the attorney’s fees allotted under this settlement no less
than 7 calendar days before the continued hearing date.
Moving party to give notice.
 
        Dated this 4th day of December 2023
