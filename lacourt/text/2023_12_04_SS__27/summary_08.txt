And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Steven Pagliaro's motion to compel further responses from Defendant Amir, LLC. The Plaintiff is seeking relevant information related to the incident, including policies, procedures, inspection guidelines, and maintenance records. The Court finds that the Defendant's responses were insufficient and failed to provide documents, and therefore grants the Plaintiff's motion.

The Court orders the Defendant to provide further responses without objection and pay $500 in sanctions. The Plaintiff had requested $2,936.65 in sanctions, but the Court finds that most of the work completed by the Plaintiff's attorney was already compensated through previous sanctions.

The Defendant is required to provide further responses and pay the sanctions within 30 days of the order.
