I.INTRODUCTION 
 
On August 2, 2022, Plaintiff
Steven Pagliaro (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants Tenten
Wilshire, LLC, Amidi Partners, LLC, Amidi Real Estate, LLC, Admidi, LLC
(“Defendants”) alleging two causes of action for premises liability and general
negligence. The complaint alleges that Plaintiff, a tenant of the Subject
Property, was using the back staircase that was slippery, uneven, and/or
otherwise dangerous. Plaintiff fell and was injured. 
 
On January 20, 2023, Defendants
Tenten Wilshire, LLC, and Amir, LLC filed an Answer. 
 
On September 19, 2023, Plaintiff
filed a Motion to Compel Further Responses to Request for Production of
Documents Set One, as to Amir, LLC. As of November 29, 2023, no opposition has
been filed. 
 
 
                
II.LEGAL STANDARD 
 
The propounding party may bring a motion to
compel further responses to a demand for production if the propounding
party deems that production is deficient, incomplete, or contains meritless
objections.  CCP § 2031.310(a).  The legal burden to
justify refusing or failing to provide discovery lies with the objecting
party.  (Coy v. Superior Court (1962)
58 Cal.2d 210, 220). 
 
The motion must be accompanied by a good-faith
meet-and-confer declaration. CCP § 2031.310(b). “A determination of
whether an attempt at informal resolution is adequate . . . involves the
exercise of discretion.” (Stewart v.
Colonial W. Agency (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 1006, 1016).  “The
history of the litigation, the nature of the interaction between counsel, the
nature of the issues, the type and scope of discovery requested, the prospects
for success and other similar factors can be relevant.  Judges have broad
powers and responsibility to determine what measure and procedures are
appropriate in varying circumstances.”  Id. 
 
CCP § 2031.310 provides the court shall
apposes monetary sanctions against a person, party, or attorney that
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response, unless
that subject to sanction acted “with substantial justification or other
circumstances make the imposition of sanctions unjust.”  CCP §
2023.010(h).  The court “may impose a monetary sanction” against any
attorney or party, or both, to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney
fees, if there has been a “misuse of the discovery process.  CCP §
2023.030(a).  “A trial court has broad discretion when imposing a
discovery sanction.”  (Lee v.
Lee (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1553, 1559). 
 
             
III.DISCUSSION 
 
Plaintiff seeks to compel
Defendant Amir, LLC, to provide further responses, without objections, to the
Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, Nos. 20-21, 17-42, 49-54, 56,
64-68, 70-72, 74-76, 80-87, 89-90, and 91-96.
 
Background: 
 
            Plaintiff
propounded the initial Requests for Production of Documents back on August 29,
2022, with a deadline of September 28, 2022. Defendant served unverified
responses on January 4, 2023. Over the next months, Plaintiff sent multiple
meet and confer letters to defense counsel, granted multiple extensions and set
up an Informal Discovery Conference. By August 29, 2023, Plaintiff granted
Defendant one final extension, with responses due on September 12, 2023.
However, as of the date of this motion, Plaintiff has not received verified
substantive responses. 
 
Plaintiff argues that Defendant’s
responses were insufficient, some of which contained objections. Some of
Defendant’s responses indicated that discovery was still ongoing and is still
searching for documents, others objected to the requested information and
stated this information was protected under the work product privilege, and the
information sought premature disclosure of expert-related information.
Moreover, despite responding to many of the responses that they would comply
with the request, Defendant has failed to produce any documents that are
responsive to the requests. 
 
After reviewing the responses to
these questions, the
Court finds that further responses must be provided. Here, Plaintiff is seeking
relevant information. “Section 2017.010 and other statues governing discovery
‘must be construed liberally in favor or disclosure unless the request is
clearly improper by virtue of well-established causes of denial’” (Yelp Inc. v. Superior Court (2017) 17
Cal.App.5th 1, 15). These requests seek documents that include, but are not
limited to, policies or procedures in place at the time of the incident,
inspection guidelines, other incidents involving the same location, recent
repairs or modifications of the staircase, maintenance records, videos or
photographs of the area, and insurance policies. However, Defendant’s responses
are insufficient. Many of the responses do not comply with CCP §
2031.210-2031.240. Moreover, despite indicating that it would comply with a
number of responses, Defendant failed to produce documents that correspond to
the requests. Thus, this information is relevant as it concerns the documents
and electronically store information about the incident, such as reports and
videos. Moreover, Plaintiff agreed that it would “exclude Defendant Amir’s
attorneys and others” from “person” in the defined terms. Defendant has failed
to provide a sufficient reason for not sufficiently responding to these
Requests for Production of Documents, and discovery disclosure is construed
liberally. 
 
Therefore, Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further
Response to Request for Production of Documents is GRANTED.  
 
Sanctions: 
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that
the court may impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of
the discovery process to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s
fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery
process includes failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of
discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) Further, sanctions are
mandatory in the event that a party “unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion
to compel further responses to a demand, unless it finds that the one subject
to the sanction acted with substantial justification…” (CCP § 2031.310). 
 
Plaintiff requests
$2,936.65 in sanctions. This is based on an hourly rate of $250 for a total of
11.5 hours. This is based on the following:
 
Review of Initial
Discovery Responses 1.0 
January 23, 2023,
Meet and Confer Letter 1.0 
May 4, 2023, Meet
and Confer Letter 1.0 
August 22, 2023,
Meet and Confer Letter 1.0 
Preparation of IDC
Form 0.5 
Preparation of
Motion 1.5 
Preparation of
Separate Statement 3.0 
Anticipated Review
of Opposition 0.5 
Anticipated
Preparation of Reply 1.0 
Court Appearance
1.0 
 
Total Time 11.5
 
Additionally, Plaintiff requests $61.65
for the costs of filing this motion. 
 
The Court finds
that the hourly rate of $250 is reasonable. However, the court has already
granted sanctions related to most of the functions set forth above as part of
the series of discovery motions. Any further work for each of these pending
motions had to have been minimal. Accordingly, the Court grants reasonable
sanctions as to this motion in the amount of $500.
            
Defendant is to provide
further responses without objection and pay the $500 in sanctions ordered
herein within 30 days of this order.
 
Moving party to give
notice. 
 
Parties who intend to submit on
this tentative must send an email to the Court at SSCDEPT27@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit on the tentative as directed by the instructions
provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  Please be advised that
if you submit on the tentative and elect not to appear at the hearing, the
opposing party may nevertheless appear at the hearing and argue the
matter.  Unless you receive a submission from all other parties in the
matter, you should assume that others might appear at the hearing to
argue.  If the Court does not receive emails from the parties indicating
submission on this tentative ruling and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the Court may, at its discretion, adopt the tentative as the final
order or place the motion off calendar.
