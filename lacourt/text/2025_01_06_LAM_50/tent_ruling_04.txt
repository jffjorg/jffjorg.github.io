[1]Code of Civil Procedure section 1856, subdivision (a) provides that the “[t]erms set forth in a writing
intended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement with respect
to the terms included therein may not be contradicted by evidence of a prior
agreement or of a contemporaneous oral agreement.” 
 


[2]The Court notes
that Cross-Defendants submit evidence in connection with the reply to support
the argument that leave to amend should be denied. As a threshold matter, “[t]he demurrer tests the pleading alone
and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters which do not appear on the face
of the pleading or cannot be properly inferred from the factual allegations of
the complaint.” (Executive Landscape Corp. v. San Vicente Country
Villas IV Assn. (1983) 145
Cal.App.3d 496, 499.) The Court declines to consider Cross-Defendants’
counsel’s declaration filed with Cross-Defendants’ replies in support of the
demurrer and motion to strike.
