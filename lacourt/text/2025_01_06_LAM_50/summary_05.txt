This Tentative Ruling denies the motion to set aside the dismissal and enforce the settlement. The Plaintiff, CREDITORS ADJUSTMENT BUREAU, INC., filed a motion to set aside the dismissal and enforce the settlement, which was entered into with the Defendant, DLF LOGISTICS LLC, on April 30, 2023.

However, the Defendant failed to make all of the required payments, and the Plaintiff provided notice of default to the Defendant. The Court finds that the Plaintiff has demonstrated grounds for the Court to enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the parties' Stipulation for Entry of Judgment. Therefore, the Court grants the Plaintiff's motion and orders the dismissal set aside, and judgment is entered in favor of the Plaintiff and against the Defendant in the total sum of $43,680.25.
