And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the request to amend the pleadings and has reviewed the evidence submitted by the parties. The judge notes that the demurrer (a legal challenge to the pleading) only tests the pleading itself, not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. The judge declines to consider the declaration filed by Cross-Defendants' counsel in support of the demurrer and motion to strike, as it is not part of the pleading. The judge is considering the Code of Civil Procedure section 1856, subdivision (a) and the case of Executive Landscape Corp. v. San Vicente Country Villas IV Assn. (1983) in making this decision.
