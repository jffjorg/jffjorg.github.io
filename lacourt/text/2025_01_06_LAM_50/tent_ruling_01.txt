[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:
 
VERIFIED
  APPLICATION FOR PRO HAC VICE ADMISSION OF ATTORNEY MARK FIORE; 
 
VERIFIED
  APPLICATION FOR PRO HAC VICE ADMISSION OF ATTORNEY VICTORIA PENG-RUE
 
 



 
Defendants Merck &
Co., Inc. and Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC (formerly known as Merck Sharp &
Dohme Corp.) (jointly, “Merck”) apply for orders admitting Mark Fiore and
Victoria Peng-Rue pro hac vice as co-counsel for Merck. 
The Court notes a few defects with the
applications. 
First, pursuant to California
Rules of Court, rule 9.40, subdivision (a)(2), no person is eligible to
appear as counsel pro hac vice if the person is “[r]egularly
employed in the State of California.” Mr. Fiore
and Ms. Peng-Rue state that they are “not regularly engaged in substantial
business, professional, or other activities in the State of California.” (Fiore Decl., ¶ 2; Peng-Rue
Decl., ¶ 2.) However, Mr. Fiore and Ms. Peng-Rue do not indicate that they are
not “[r]egularly employed in the State
of California.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 9.40, subd. (a)(2).)  
Second, pursuant to California Rules of
Court, rule 9.40, subdivision (d)(5), “[t]he application must
state…The title of each court and cause in which the applicant has filed an
application to appear as counsel pro hac vice in this state in the preceding
two years, the date of each application, and whether or not it was granted.”
Ms. Peng-Rue states, “I have filed one application to appear as counsel pro
hac vice in the following proceedings in the State of California in the
past two years, in Merrick Brunker v. Merck & Co. Inc., et al., Case
No. 56-2022-00563045-CU-PL-VTA; I was admitted in
that case on September 5, 2024.” (Peng-Rue Decl., ¶ 7.) However, Ms. Peng-Rue
does not indicate “[t]he title of [the] court” in which such application was
filed, or the “date of [the] application.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 9.40, subd. (d)(5).) 
In
addition, Mr. Fiore states that he has “not filed an application to
appear as counsel pro hac vice in the following proceedings in the State
of California in the past two years.” (Fiore Decl., ¶ 7.) Mr. Fiore
does not specify what “proceedings” he is referring to. It is unclear from
paragraph 7 of Mr. Fiore’s declaration if Mr. Fiore has “filed an application
to appear as counsel pro hac vice in
this state in the preceding two years.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 9.40, subd. (d)(5).)
Based on the foregoing, Merck’s applications are denied without prejudice. Merck is ordered to provide notice of
this ruling.
