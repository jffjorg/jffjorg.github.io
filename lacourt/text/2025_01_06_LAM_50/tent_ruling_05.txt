[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:
 
MOTION TO
  SET ASIDE DISMISSAL AND TO ENFORCE SETTLEMENT PURSUANT TO C.C.P. 664.6



 
Background 
Plaintiff Creditors
Adjustment Bureau, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed this action on November 29, 2022
against Defendant DLF Logistics LLC (“Defendant”). The Complaint alleges causes
of action for (1) breach of contract, (2) open book account, (3) account
stated, and (4) reasonable value. 
On April 30, 2023, a
“Stipulation for Entry of Dismissal Pursuant to C.C.P §
664.6” was filed in this action. This Stipulation provides, inter alia,
that “IT IS HEREBY STIPULATED between plaintiff, CREDITORS ADJUSTMENT
BUREAU, INC., and defendant, DLF LOGISTICS LLC (hereinafter the ‘Parties’),
that the above-referenced matter has been resolved in a mutually satisfactory
manner. IT IS FURTHER STIPULATED between the Parties that this action shall be
dismissed without prejudice pursuant to C.C.P. § 664.6,
with the Court reserving its power to set aside the dismissal and ordering
entry of judgment upon a showing of default in the specified terms of the
Stipulation for Entry of Judgment executed by the Parties concurrently
herewith.” 
On April 30, 2023, the
Court entered an Order providing, inter alia, as follows: 
 
“IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT THIS
MATTER IS DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE, WITH THE COURT RESERVING JURISDICTION TO
SET ASIDE THE DISMISSAL AND ORDERING ENTRY OF JUDGMENT UPON A SHOWING OF
DEFAULT IN THE SPECIFIED TERMS OF THE STIPULATION FOR ENTRY OF JUDGMENT…” 
Plaintiff now moves “for
an order to set aside the dismissal,” and to enforce the settlement entered between Plaintiff and Defendant.
Defendant filed a “non-opposition” to the motion. 
Discussion 
“If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the
court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof,
the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the
settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over
the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of
the settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd.
(a).) 
“Although a judge hearing
a section 664.6 motion may receive
evidence, determine disputed facts, and enter the terms of a settlement
agreement as a judgment, nothing in section 664.6 authorizes
a judge to create the
material terms of a settlement, as opposed to deciding what terms the parties themselves have previously
agreed upon.” (Weddington
Productions, Inc. v. Flick (1998)
60 Cal.App.4th 793, 810 [internal citations omitted, emphasis in original].) 
In the motion, Plaintiff
states that it “requests that the dismissal triggered by the Stipulation
for Entry of Dismissal Pursuant to C.C.P. § 664.6
filed on April 30, 2023 be set aside and judgment be entered against defendant
DLF LOGISTICS LLC for the full balance of $50,880.25, less payments made by
defendant pursuant to the terms of [the] stipulation in the sum of $7,200.00,
for a judgment amount of $43,680.25.” (Mot. at p. 6:12-15.)
Exhibit 1 to Plaintiff’s counsel’s supporting declaration is the
parties’ “Stipulation for Entry of Judgment.” (Jun Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. 1.) The
Stipulation for Entry of Judgment provides, inter alia, as follows: 
 
“Defendant
stipulates to the entry of judgment in the sum of $50,880.25 in favor of
Plaintiff and against Defendant. However, this Stipulation shall not be filed
with the court and no judgment shall be entered pursuant thereto so long as the
Defendant pays Plaintiff the sum of $49,680.25, in accordance with the payment
schedule set forth hereinbelow, without default and failure to timely cure: 
 
a.)
The sum of $2,400.00 shall be paid on the 15th day of each month, for twenty
(20) consecutive months commencing February 15, 2023, and continuing each month
thereafter through September 15, 2024; and 
 
b.)
A final payment of $1,680.25 shall be paid on or before October 15, 2024.” 
 
(Jun
Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. 1, p. 2:6-14.) 
The Stipulation for Entry of Judgment further provides that “[i]n the
event payment is not made within 10 days of the date written notice is sent by
mail, Plaintiff may, on the eleventh (11th) day immediately following said
written notice of default, declare the then entire unpaid balance immediately
due and payable together with reasonable attorney’s fees incurred in the
collection of said obligation if said default has not been cured. In such
event, judgment shall be immediately entered in the sum of $50,880.25 together
with reasonable attorney’s fees in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant,
less any sums received by Plaintiff from said Defendant pursuant to the terms
of this Stipulation.” (Jun Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. 1, pp. 2:23-3:1.)
The Stipulation for Entry of Judgment also provides that “IT IS
FURTHER STIPULATED between the Parties that this Court retain jurisdiction over
the parties hereto to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the
terms of the settlement, in accordance with Code of
Civil Procedure §664.6.” (Jun Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. 1, p. 4:5-7.)
Plaintiff indicates that on May 24, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel sent a
letter to Defendant’s counsel indicating, inter alia, “[p]lease be
advised that your client is currently in default as to the terms and conditions
of the Stipulation for Entry of Judgment in regard to the above-captioned
matter. Your client is in arrears as to the sum of $4,800.00 representing
payment due April 15, 2023 in the amount of $2,400.00 and May 15, 2023 in the
amount of $2,400.00. In regard to the above, please be advised that unless the
sum of $4,800.00 is received in this office within ten (10) days from the date
of this letter, we will have no other alternative than to proceed with the
filing of the Stipulation for Entry of Judgment with the Court and request
judgment be entered against your client pursuant to the terms and conditions of
said Stipulation…” (Jun Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. 3.) 
Plaintiff’s counsel states that “Defendant DLF LOGISTICS LLC failed to
make the payment pursuant to the attached Settlement Agreement.” (Jun Decl., ¶
5.) As set forth above, Defendant filed a “non-opposition” to the instant
motion. Defendant does not dispute that it did not make all of payments
required by the Stipulation for Entry of Judgment.  
As discussed, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6, “[i]f parties to
pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside of the
presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case,
or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the
terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may retain
jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in
full of the terms of the settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 664.6, subd. (a).) 
Based on the foregoing, the
Court finds that Plaintiff has demonstrated grounds for the Court to enter
judgment pursuant to the terms of the parties’ Stipulation for Entry of
Judgment, specifically, the terms providing that “[i]n the event payment
is not made within 10 days of the date written notice is sent by mail,
Plaintiff may, on the eleventh (11th) day immediately following said written
notice of default, declare the then entire unpaid balance immediately due and
payable together with reasonable attorney’s fees incurred in the collection of
said obligation if said default has not been cured. In such event, judgment
shall be immediately entered in the sum of $50,880.25 together with reasonable
attorney’s fees in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant, less any sums
received by Plaintiff from said Defendant pursuant to the terms of this
Stipulation.” (Jun Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. 1, pp. 2:23-3:1.) Plaintiff’s counsel states
that Defendant made payments “pursuant to the terms of [the] stipulation in the
sum of $7,200.00...” (Jun Decl., ¶ 6.) As discussed, Plaintiff requests that
the Court “vacate the previous dismissal and award plaintiff the full balance
of $50,880.25, less payments made by defendant pursuant to the terms of [the]
stipulation in the sum of $7,200.00, for a judgment amount of $43,680.25.” (Jun
Decl., ¶ 6.) This request is not opposed by Defendant. 
Conclusion 
Based
on the foregoing, the Court grants Plaintiff’s motion to set aside dismissal
and to enforce settlement. 
The dismissal in this
action is ordered set aside, and judgment is entered in favor of Plaintiff and against
Defendant in the total sum of $43,680.25. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to provide notice of this Order.
