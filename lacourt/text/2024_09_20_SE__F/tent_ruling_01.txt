Defendant/Cross-Complainant
PEACE LUTHERAN CHURCH, INCORPORATED, OF SOUTH GATE, CALIFORNIA’s unopposed
Motion to Continue Trial and Related Dates is GRANTED.
 
Moving
Party to give Notice. 
 
No
Opposition filed as of September 19, 2024. 
 
This
action concerning real property was filed on April 26, 2022. Trial is currently
scheduled for October 15, 2024. The Court notes that there is one discovery
motion, and two motions for summary judgment/adjudication scheduled to be heard
after trial. 
 
Defendant/Cross-Complainant
PEACE LUTHERAN CHURCH, INCORPORATED, OF SOUTH GATE, CALIFORNIA (“Moving Party”)
moves to continue trial and all related dates to a date on or after February
21, 2025 for the following reasons: 
 
·       
A
First Amended Complaint was recently filed on August 5, 2024; 
·       
The
Doe Defendant(s) have not yet been served by publication; 
·       
There
are motions scheduled to be heard beyond the currently scheduled trial date. 
·       
Defendant
Janet Torres dba Kids Forum Preschool and Daycare agrees to continue the trial
date. 
 
The
Moving Party indicates in the Moving Papers that Plaintiff/Cross-Complainant
THE PACIFIC SOUTHWEST DISTRICT OF THE LUTHERAN CHURCH-MISSOURI SYNOD
(“Plaintiff”) failed to respond to Moving Party’s meet and confer efforts to
stipulate to a continuance of trial. 
 
As
indicated above, this Motion is unopposed. 
 
“Although
continuances of trials are disfavored, each request for a continuance must be
considered on its own merits. The court may grant a continuance only on an
affirmative showing of good case requiring the continuance. Circumstances that
may indicate good cause include…. (6) A party’s excused inability to obtain
essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent
efforts; or (7) A significant, unanticipated change in the status of the case
as a result of which the case is not ready for trial.” (CRC Rule 3.1332(c).) 
 
Given
the recently filed amended pleading, the outstanding discovery issues pending,
and the timely filed Motions for Summary Judgment/Adjudication set for hearing
beyond the currently scheduled date for trial, the Court finds good cause to
continue trial to a date on or after February 21, 2025, depending on the Court
and parties’ availabilities. Discovery and all related deadlines will track the
new trial date. The Court will confer with the parties to secure new FSC and
trial dates. 
 
The
Motion is GRANTED.
