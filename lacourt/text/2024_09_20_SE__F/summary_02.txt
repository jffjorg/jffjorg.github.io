And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motion for trial preference under CCP §36(a) without prejudice. The motion was filed by Doris and Miguel, who claim that they were injured in a slip and fall accident at Lakewood Regional Medical Center, Inc. on February 6, 2024. They argue that they qualify for a preferential trial date because of their age and health issues. The judge finds that the declaration submitted by the plaintiffs' attorney fails to show that the health of either plaintiff is such that not granting a preferential trial date would prejudice their interest in the litigation. The judge also notes that the declaration does not state facts showing the need for any expedience, and that the plaintiffs do not indicate that their conditions are at risk of worsening before their case comes to trial.
