On August 12, 2022, plaintiffs  Estate of Run de Zhu (Plaintiff), Mei Ai Ma, an individual,  successor-in-interest to Run De Zhu, and personal representative of the Estate  of Run De Zhu, and Yingjie Zhu, filed this action against defendants Cherry  Wong, Raymond Wong, Yinghui Zhu (Yinghui), and Does 1 to 10, alleging causes of  action for breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and  fair dealing, breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary  duty, intentional misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, fraudulent  concealment, false promise, constructive fraud, conversion, conspiracy,  accounting, tort of another claim for attorney fees, violation of Penal Code §  496, negligence, financial elder abuse, restitution for unjust enrichment,  quiet title, cancellation of instrument, declaratory relief, and imposition of  resulting trust.  On October 9, 2024, Plaintiff moved to compel responses to written  discovery requests and deem requests for admission admitted. The motions are  unopposed.  LEGAL  STANDARD  Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300, subdivision  (a), provides that on receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding  party may move for an order compelling a further response if the propounding  party deems that any of the following apply:               (1) An answer to a particular  interrogatory is evasive or incomplete. (2) An exercise of the option to produce  documents under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required  specification of those documents is inadequate. (3) An objection to an interrogatory is  without merit or too general.  (Code Civ.  Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a).)             Code of Civil Procedure section  2030.300, subdivision (d), further provides that “[t]he court shall impose a  monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against  any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to  compel a further response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one  subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other  circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., §  2030.300, subd. (d).)  Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310,  subdivision (a), provides that on receipt of a response to a request for  production of documents, the demanding party may move for an order compelling  further responses if: (1) A statement of compliance with the demand  is incomplete. (2) A representation of inability to comply is  inadequate, incomplete, or evasive. (3) An objection in the response is without  merit or too general.  (Code Civ.  Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a).)  Code of Civil  Procedure section 2031.310, subdivision (h), further provides that “[t]he court  shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section  2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or  opposes a motion to compel further response to a demand, unless it finds that  the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that  other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ.  Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (h).)  Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.290, subdivision  (a), provides that on receipt of a response to requests for admissions, the  party requesting admissions may move for an order compelling a further response  if: (1)  An answer to a particular request is evasive or incomplete. (2)  An objection to a particular request is without merit or too general.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (a).)              Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.290, subdivision  (d), further provides that, “[t]he court shall impose a monetary sanction under  Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or  attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further  response, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with  substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of  the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290,  subd. (d).)  DISCUSSION    The  Court notes multiple problems with Plaintiff’s discovery motions. First,  Plaintiff characterized these motions as motions to compel rather than what  they really are, which are motions to compel further responses since the issue  here is not the lack of responses but rather the assertion of improper  objections. (Liberzon Decls., Ex. 2; Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd.  (a)(3), 2031.310, subd. (a)(3), 2033.290, subd. (a)(2).) Since these motions  are really motions to compel further responses, Plaintiff was required to meet  and confer before bringing them and to also provide separate statements for  each motion. (Ibid., §§ 2030.300, subd. (b)(1), 2031.310, subd. (b)(2),  2033.290, subd. (b)(1); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345, subds. (a)(1)-(a)(3);  Golf  & Tennis Pro Shop, Inc. v. Superior Ct. (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 127, 136,  fn. 9 (Golf & Tennis Pro Shop.)  Plaintiff did not do so. (See Liberzon Decls., ¶ 10.) The lack of a separate  statement by itself is sufficient grounds to deny the motions. (See Mills  v. U.S. Bank (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 871, 893.) This Court also requests  parties to participate in an Informal Discovery Conference before bringing a  motion to compel further responses, which Plaintiff did not do. (Dept. 6  Courtroom Information.)  Second,  the Court lacks jurisdiction to even consider these motions. The time limit for  a motion to compel further responses is 45 days from the date the verified responses  are served. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (c), 2031.310, subd. (c),  2033.290, subd. (c).) Courts lack jurisdiction to consider untimely motions to  compel further responses other than to deny them. (See Sexton v. Superior Ct.  (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410 (“the Legislature has explicitly stated that  unless a party moves to compel further response within 45 days of the  unsatisfactory response, he waives any right to compel a further response.”  [internal citation omitted]); see also Vidal Sassoon, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Halpern)  (1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 681, 685 (court lacks jurisdiction to order further  answers after 45 days).) The responses to these discovery requests were served  electronically on December 8, 2023. (Liberzon Decls., ¶ 9.) The motions were  filed on October 9, 2024. It has been well over 45 days since Yinghui served  these responses.  Yinghui's responses to the discovery requests contained  only objections, and thus, did not need to be verified by Yinghui, pursuant to  Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.250, subd. (a), 2031.250, subd. (a), 2033.240,  subd. (a).  The Court recognizes that relevant code sections state  that the time limit for bringing a motion to compel further responses runs from  the service of verified responses. There is no specific statute addressing the  deadline to move to compel further responses when the responses contain only  objections, as is the case here.  The closest that the appellate courts have come to  addressing this issue is in the case of Golf & Tennis Pro Shop, Inc. v.  Superior Court (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 127, in which the Court of Appeal  (4th/3rd) dealt with the issue of the deadline to compel with respect to  unverified "hybrid" responses, i.e., some consisting of only  objections and some consisting of substantive responses.  In that matter, the court held that even though the  motion itself concerned only the objections, the responses were nonetheless  required to be verified, and the clock did not begin running until the  verifications were served. The court stated, “[w]e can leave for another day  the possibility of an ‘absurd result,’ as the trial court put it if there is no  time limit on a motion to compel involving objections.” (Id. at 136.)  There is no question here, that Yinghui's responses  consisting only of objections were not required to be verified. In facing the  issue that the Court of Appeal declined to address, this Court, while not bound  by any other trial court's decision, also finds that it would be an absurd  result if there was no deadline for a motion to compel a response involving  only objections. The legislature certainly could not have intended such an  outcome in drafting the discovery statutes.  Accordingly, the Court finds that service of the  unverified objections on December 8, 2023, triggered the 45-day deadline for  Plaintiff to move to compel further responses, and Plaintiff’s motions are therefore  untimely. Thus, the Court lacks jurisdiction to consider these motions and  summarily DENIES them.  CONCLUSION  The Court summarily DENIES Plaintiff Estate of Run de Zhu’s motions  to compel further responses as untimely and for lack of jurisdiction.                Defendant Yinghui Zhu is ordered to  give notice of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.
