Summary in English text:

In this tentative ruling, the court denies the plaintiff's motions to compel further responses as untimely and lacking jurisdiction. The plaintiff, Estate of Run de Zhu, filed motions to compel further responses to written discovery requests, requests for production, and special interrogatories, as well as a motion to deem requests for admission admitted. The motions were unopposed, but the court found that the plaintiff did not meet and confer before bringing the motions and that the responses to the discovery requests were served electronically on December 8, 2023, triggering a 45-day deadline for the plaintiff to move to compel further responses. The court lacks jurisdiction to consider the motions and therefore summarily denies them. The defendant, Yinghui Zhu, is ordered to give notice of the court's ruling within five calendar days of this order.
