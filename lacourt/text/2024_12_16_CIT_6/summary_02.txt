And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Carmen Rodriguez's petition to permit a late claim against Defendant Hacienda La Puente Unified School District under Government Code section 946.6. The plaintiff was injured on August 27, 2023, when she fell into an open hole on the road verge in Hacienda Heights. The plaintiff's counsel mistakenly thought the location was within the county boundaries and submitted claims to the County of Los Angeles and the City of Industry, which were rejected. The plaintiff then submitted a claim to the School District, which was also rejected as untimely. The plaintiff applied for permission to present a late claim against the School District, but the application was denied.

The judge finds that the plaintiff's failure to present the claim in a timely manner was due to mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, and that the plaintiff was otherwise diligent in investigating the claim. The judge also finds that the School District did not present sufficient evidence demonstrating that it would be prejudiced if the petition was granted.

Therefore, the court grants the petition and permits the plaintiff's late claim against the School District. The plaintiff is ordered to give notice of the court's ruling within five calendar days of this order.
