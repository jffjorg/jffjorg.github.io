And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal entered on July 29, 2024. The plaintiff's counsel suffered a medical emergency, which led to his failure to respond to discovery requests and appear at the hearing. However, the judge finds that the plaintiff's counsel did not notify the court or defendant of his situation and that other counsel had assisted the plaintiff in the matter. Additionally, the plaintiff has not provided verified responses that substantially comply with applicable requirements, which is required to obtain relief from a terminating discovery sanction. Therefore, the judge concludes that the dismissal was not caused by excusable neglect or mistake, and the motion is denied.
