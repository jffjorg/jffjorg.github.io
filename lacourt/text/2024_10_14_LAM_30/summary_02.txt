And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to quash or modify a deposition subpoena issued to Google Inc. The subpoena seeks production of business records related to the plaintiff's employment at Google. The judge has granted the motion in part.

The judge has determined that requests 1-15 of the subpoena are overly broad and infringe on the plaintiff's right to privacy. The judge has also determined that requests 6-8 and 11 of the subpoena are not relevant to the subject matter of the case and are not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.

The judge has allowed requests 2-5, 14, and 15 of the subpoena, which seek production of documents related to the plaintiff's performance and disciplinary records, documents related to complaints made about the plaintiff, and documents related to the plaintiff's separation from Google. The judge has determined that these documents are relevant to the subject matter of the case and are reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.

The judge has also determined that the plaintiff's personnel file and employee records are within a well-established zone of privacy and are not subject to discovery. The judge has not allowed requests 9, 10, 12, and 13 of the subpoena, which seek production of documents related to complaints made about the plaintiff, as these documents are not relevant to the subject matter of the case and are not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.

The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change based on any further arguments or evidence presented at the hearing.
