And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer and motion to strike filed by Defendant Doe 4 in a case involving childhood sexual assault and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The plaintiff, W.P., alleges that Doe 4 sexually assaulted her when she was seven years old and that she suffers from severe emotional distress as a result.

The judge has sustained Defendant Doe 4's demurrer to the first cause of action, which alleges childhood sexual assault and battery, on the grounds that the complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to constitute a claim against Doe 4. The judge has also denied Defendant Doe 4's motion to strike Plaintiff's allegations for punitive damages.

However, the judge has overruled Defendant Doe 4's demurrer to the second cause of action, which alleges intentional infliction of emotional distress. The judge has found that Plaintiff has sufficiently pled facts to maintain her cause of action against Doe 4, including allegations that Doe 4 engaged in despicable conduct by repeatedly engaging in unlawful conduct with minors and by sexually assaulting Plaintiff.

The judge has denied Defendant Doe 4's motion to strike Plaintiff's allegations for punitive damages, finding that the complaint sufficiently alleges despicable conduct by Doe 4. The judge has set a hearing date for January 16, 2024, to consider the tentative ruling.
