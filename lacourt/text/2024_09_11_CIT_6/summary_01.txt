And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Dagoberto Reyes' motion to set aside the dismissal of the action against Miguel Banderas. The motion was unopposed and was brought within the six-month deadline set by Code of Civil Procedure section 473. The judge found that Dagoberto's attorney made a mistake by filing a dismissal as to all parties when it should have only applied to Plaintiff Luz Maria Reyes. The judge also noted that the attorney provided a declaration attesting to his fault and that the defendant's lack of opposition was a tacit admission that the motion was meritorious. As a result, the judge granted the motion and ordered Dagoberto to give notice of the ruling within five calendar days.
