And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling sets aside the default entered on September 1, 2022, and the default judgment entered on February 23, 2023. The defendant, Ronald McEwan, filed a motion to set aside the default and default judgment, alleging that he was not properly served with the summons and complaint. The defendant claims that he was not aware of the action against him until October 13, 2023, when he was notified by UberEATS. The plaintiff, ASPIRE GENERAL INSURANCE COMPANY, argues that the defendant was properly served and had actual notice of the action. The court finds that the motion is timely and that the defendant has shown that service did not result in actual notice in time to defend the action, and that his lack of notice was not caused by his avoidance or inexcusable neglect. The court grants the motion and sets aside the default and default judgment. The defendant is ordered to file a responsive pleading forthwith.
