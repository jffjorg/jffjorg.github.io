  Case Number:  23SMCV04469    Hearing Date:   August 16, 2024    Dept:  I The motions to compel are GRANTED.  Total sanctions in the amount of $1480 are
GRANTED against plaintiff, but not counsel, and are payable within 30 days. 
 
Plaintiff filed a negligence action.  Defendant served form interrogatories,
special interrogatories, and requests for production.  Plaintiff did not respond.  Because no explanation or justification was
given for the failure to respond, the motion must be GRANTED.  The court notes that it has reviewed the
RFP’s and they are appropriate.  Verified
responses without objection other than privilege will be served within 30 days
and will be Code-compliant.  If anything
is withheld on the basis of privilege, a log will be provided at the same
time.  Documents will also be provided at
the same time.
 
Defendant seeks $1460 for each motion concerning
interrogatories and $1260 for the RFP motion. 
There was no opposition to the motions and hence no reply.  Accordingly, the court assumes that it took 4
hours to draft one of the motions and only 1 hour for each of the other motions
because they were largely the same—just different attachments.  The court will also award .5 hours for the
joint hearing.  The requested hourly rate
of $200/hour is reasonable.  Finally, the
three filing fees are appropriate.
