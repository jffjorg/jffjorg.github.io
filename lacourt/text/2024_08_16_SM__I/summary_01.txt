And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a negligence action brought by the plaintiff. The defendant had served the plaintiff with form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production, but the plaintiff failed to respond. The Judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel and imposed sanctions against the plaintiff in the amount of $1480, to be paid within 30 days. The Judge has also ordered the plaintiff to provide verified responses to the discovery requests, without objection except for privilege, within 30 days. The Judge has awarded the defendant $1460 for each motion concerning interrogatories, $1260 for the RFP motion, and $800 for filing fees. The Judge assumed that it took 4 hours to draft one of the motions and 1 hour for each of the other motions, and has awarded 0.5 hours for the joint hearing. The requested hourly rate of $200 per hour is reasonable.
