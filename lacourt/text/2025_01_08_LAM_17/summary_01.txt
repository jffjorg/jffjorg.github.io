And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to consolidate two separate lawsuits against the same defendant. The plaintiff, T.K., alleges that she was abused by her teacher, William Alexander, from 1977 to 1978, while the other plaintiff, A.H., alleges that she was abused by Alexander from 1973 to 1974. The court found that the two cases do not have sufficient grounds for consolidation, as they involve different time periods, different witnesses, and separate claims for damages. The court also noted that the plaintiff's failure to seek consolidation earlier, despite having known about the overlap in the cases since 2022, is a significant factor in its decision.
