 Case No.: 
  21STCV46199  
 
 
 
 Hearing
  Date:  January 8, 2025




 
Plaintiff’s
motion to consolidate is DENIED.
 
On
12/17/2023, Plaintiff T.K. (Plaintiff) filed suit against DOE 1. On 1/14/2022,
Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint (FAC) alleging: (1) negligence and;
(2) negligent hiring, retention, and supervision. 
 
            On
10/25/2024, Plaintiff moved to consolidate this action with the matter A.H.
V. LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT, et al., Los Angeles County Superior
Court Case No. 22STCV06484.
 
Discussion 
 
            Plaintiff
argues that consolidation of the two actions is proper under section 1048,
because both cases involve the same questions of fact and law, both cases
utilize the same witnesses, and consolidation will promote judicial economy in
light of the theses circumstances. 
 
            In
opposition, Defendant argues that consolidation is improper because the two
matters involve two different plaintiffs in two different time periods.
 
            After
review, the Court finds insufficient grounds to support consolidation. 
 
Plaintiff
T.K., in this current matter, alleges she was abused by her teacher, William
Alexander, from 1977 to 1978. By contrast, 
Plaintiff A.H., from Case No. 22STCV06484, alleges she was abused by
Alexander from 1973 to 1974. There is no overlap in time when the incidents
occurred and there is also no indication that the students knew each other.
Also, given that there is no overlap in time, each Plaintiff is expected to
call different witnesses. Moreover, each respective Plaintiff has a separate
and distinct claim for damages which involves facts and evidence that is
separate and distinct for each Plaintiff.
 
Moreover,
Plaintiff here offers no persuasive explanation for the delay in seeking
consolidation of the cases. These two cases have now been pending for several
years, and the Plaintiffs in both cases are represented by the same law firm.
Plaintiff T.K. filed her lawsuit on 12/17/2021 and has known that the two cases
involved the same alleged perpetrator since 2/22/ 2022 when Plaintiff A.H.
filed her lawsuit. Although it has been more than three and a half years since
Plaintiff A.H. filed her lawsuit, Plaintiff T.K. now seeks to consolidate the
two cases when trial in this matter is set to start on January 21, 2025.
 
Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion to consolidate is denied.
 
It is so ordered.
