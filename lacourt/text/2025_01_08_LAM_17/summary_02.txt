Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Waring Plaza Properties, L.P.'s (Waring) motion for leave to amend to file a second amended complaint (SAC). Waring seeks to add a new cause of action for violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200 et seq. and remove two causes of action from the first amended complaint (FAC) that were previously demurred. The judge found that Waring's motion should be granted because the policy favoring leave to amend is strong and the adverse party (Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, LLP) has not shown meaningful prejudice. The proposed SAC does not contain any new facts, but rather a new legal theory seeking restitution of fees Waring paid to defendants. The judge ordered that the motion for leave to amend be granted.
