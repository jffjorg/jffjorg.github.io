And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant's motion to strike the plaintiffs' complaint for punitive damages is granted. The plaintiffs' allegations of the defendant's reckless behavior while driving under the influence are insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. The defendant's request for judicial notice of the docket of People v. Grayley is granted. The defendant's motion to strike Paragraph 14(a)(2), Paragraph EX-1, Paragraph EX-2, and Paragraph EX-3 ("Punitive Damages") is granted with 20 days leave to amend.
