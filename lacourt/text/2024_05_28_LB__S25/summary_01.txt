```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the motion to consolidate the cases of David May v. American Honda Motor Co., et al. (Case No. 22LBCV00733) and Lisa McCafferty v. American Honda Motor Co., et al. (Case No. 22LBCV00538). The judge finds that consolidation is necessary to avoid unnecessary costs or delay, as both cases involve the same witnesses, same defective product causes of action, and same or vastly similar experts. The judge also notes that the two plaintiffs live together and would face significant challenges trying two cases separately. The consolidated case will be designated as the lead case, with the McCafferty matter being designated as the lead case.
