  Case Number:  22LBCV00733    Hearing Date:   May 28, 2024    Dept:  S25 BackgroundPlaintiff David May (“May”) filed this action against Defendants American Honda Motor Co., Inc., Ken & Joe’s Honda Kawasaki KTM, Dragonfire Racing, and Does on November 3, 2022, alleging six causes of action: (1) Strict Products Liability; (2) Negligence; (3) Breach of Warranty; (4) Negligent Recall/Retrofit; (5) Violations of California Business & Professions Code § 17200; and (6) Violations of California Business & Professions Code § 17500.On November 28, 2020, May was driving a 2021 Honda Talon (“Talon”) 1000x (a side-by-side UTA/ATV) while Lisa McCafferty (“McCafferty”) was a passenger. (Compl., ¶ 18.) While driving on an offroad trail, both May and McCafferty were wearing harnesses and helmets. (Compl., ¶ 18.) When the Talon encountered an uneven surface on the road, it flipped, performing a single frontal rollover, with it coming to rest back on its four wheels. (Compl., ¶ 19.) During the crash sequence, the roll bar collapsed and broke. (Compl., ¶ 19.) The after-market seat belt system, Dragon Racing 4-point Harness 3 (“Harness”), also failed. (Compl., ¶ 19.) May alleges he suffered catastrophic personal injuries as a result of the defective nature of the Talon and the Harness. (Compl., ¶ 20.) McCafferty also alleges she suffered catastrophic personal injuries as a result of the incident.McCafferty filed her action in Long Beach Superior Court on September 29, 2022. (Shami Decl., ¶ 13.) May filed his action on November 3, 2022. In these separate lawsuits, both May and McCafferty named the same defendants and included almost identical causes of action. (Shami Decl., ¶15.)May requests that the court consolidate the case of David May v. American Honda Motor Co., et al. (Case No. 22LBCV00733) with the case of Lisa McCafferty v. American Honda Motor Co., et al. (Case No. 22LBCV00538).On May 2, 2024, McCafferty’s matter was assigned to Dept. S25, Judge Nicole Heeseman, for all purposes. On 14, 2024, the May matter was assigned to Dept. S25, Judge Nicole Heeseman, for all purposes after a timely peremptory challenge was filed.Legal StandardCCP § 1048 provides:(a) When actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the actions; it may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.(b) The court, in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice, or when separate trials will be conducive to expedition and economy, may order a separate trial of any cause of action, including a cause of action asserted in a cross-complaint, or of any separate issue or of any number of causes of action or issues, preserving the right of trial by jury required by the Constitution or a statute of this state or of the United States.The purpose of consolidation is to avoid unnecessary costs or delay, avoid duplication of procedure, particularly in the proof of issues common to both actions, and avoid inconsistent results by hearing and deciding common issues together. (See Estate of Baker (1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 471, 484-485.) Further, the granting or denial of a motion to consolidate rests in the trial court's sound discretion and will not be reversed except upon a clear showing of abuse of discretion. (Feliner v. Steinbaum (1955) 132 Cal.App.2d 509, 511.)The court finds that May’s and McCafferty’s cases should be consolidated as (1) both cases involve the same witnesses, same defective product causes of action, same or vastly similar experts, arise out of the same operative facts; (2) both cases involve two plaintiffs who live together, one of whom takes full time care of the other, which makes trying two cases at the same time in two different courts a practical impossibility; and (3) consolidation would avoid duplication of time, money, judicial resources and the risk of inconsistent rulings.Tentative RulingThe motion to consolidate is GRANTED. The cases of Lisa McCafferty v. American Honda Motor Co., et al. (Case No. 22LBCV00538) and David May v. American Honda Motor Co., et al. (Case No. 22LBCV00733) are consolidated with the McCafferty matter designated as the lead case. (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.3(g)(2).)
