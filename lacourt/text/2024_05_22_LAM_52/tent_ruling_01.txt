  Case Number:  BC513624    Hearing Date:   May 22, 2024    Dept:  52 Plaintiffs
Jose Rios and Blanca Rios’s Motion for an Order to the Clerk to Either Amend by
Interlineation or Replace with Correct Application for and Renewal of Judgment
Plaintiffs Jose Rios and Blanca Rios move to correct
their application for renewal of judgment. 
 A court has “inherent power to
correct clerical error in [a] judgment.” 
(Ames v. Paley (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 668, 672.)  A court also has the
power “[t]o amend and control its process and orders so as to make them conform
to law and justice.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
128, subd. (a)(8).)  
Plaintiffs show good cause to correct their
application for renewal of judgment.  The
application for renewal of judgment they filed on April 11, 2024, indicates “Credits
to principal” of $176,700.93.  (Rios
Decl., Ex. A, § 5.d.)  Plaintiffs meant
to include that amount as “Accrued interest remaining due” on section 5.f of
the application.  (Rios Decl., ¶ 4, Ex.
B.)  The court will therefore strike the
application for renewal of judgment filed on April 11, 2024, and permit
plaintiffs to submit a corrected application. 

Plaintiffs Jose Rios and Blanca Rios’s motion to
amend application for renewal of judgment is granted.  
The court hereby strikes the application for renewal of judgment plaintiffs
filed on April 11, 2024.  Plaintiffs are ordered to file the corrected application for renewal of
judgment forthwith.  The corrected
application shall be deemed filed on May 2, 2024, the date on which plaintiffs
filed this motion.  The clerk shall indicate
the filing date of May 2, 2024, on the corrected application.
