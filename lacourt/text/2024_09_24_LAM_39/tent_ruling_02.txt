MOTION


Motions to Compel Further Discovery Responses




MOVING PARTY


Plaintiff Veronica
  Mendez




OPPOSING PARTIES


None


 MOTION Plaintiff Veronica
Mendez (“Plaintiff”) has filed two separate motions in which she moves to compel further responses from Defendant Guilford
Glazer Properties (“Defendant”) to Requests for Production of Documents, set two
(“RPD”) and Special Interrogatories, set two (“SROG”).  Defendant has not filed oppositions to those motions.ANALYSIS
If the propounding
party deems responses to interrogatories or requests for production of
documents unsatisfactory, the propounding party may move to compel further
responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, 2031.310.)
Defendant’s
responses to RPD Nos. 47 and 48 and SROG No. 35 consist only of objections.  As Plaintiff timely filed these motions to
compel further responses, Defendant has the burden to justify its objections.  (Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.)  Defendant has
not opposed the motions and, therefore, cannot meet that burden.  Accordingly, Defendant must further respond
to RPD Nos. 47 and 48 and SROG No. 35.
In response to RPD
Nos. 44, 45, 46, and 49 and SROG No. 36, Defendant provided responses with
ambiguous limitations.  Defendant’s
responses to RPD Nos. 44, 45, 46, and 49 are limited to documents “relating to
Plaintiff’s claims and Defendant’s defenses in this case . . . ,” with no
explanation of how Defendant defines relevance. 
(See, e.g., Separate Statement in Support of Motion to Compel Further
Responses to Requests for Production of Documents, p. 4.)  Defendant’s response to SROG No. 36 is
limited “to the time period,” with no explanation as to the specific period.  (Separate Statement in Support of Motion to
Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories, p. 7.)  These ambiguous limitations prevent Plaintiff
from understanding the scope of the responses, rendering the responses
effectively useless.  Defendant must
further respond.
Plaintiff moves to
compel further responses to RPD Nos. 53 and 54 because Plaintiff does not
believe Defendant produced all responsive documents.  Plaintiff cannot move to compel Defendant to
further respond on the basis Plaintiff believes Defendant’s responses are
untrue. (Holguin v. Superior Court (1972) 22 Cal.App.3d 812, 820.)  Plaintiff’s remedy is to offer Defendant’s
allegedly incomplete responses as admissions or as prior inconsistent
statements to impeach Defendant at trial, if Defendant seeks to introduce
evidence it did not disclose in discovery.  (Evid. Code, §§ 1220; 1235.)  While Plaintiff complains Defendant redacted
names of candidates for temporary employment with Defendant, the redaction is
appropriate to protect the privacy rights of these candidates.  (Belaire-West Landscape, Inc. v. Superior
Court (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 554,  .)  Defendant need not further respond to RPD
Nos. 53 and 54.
The Court finds
Defendant’s failure to properly respond to the written discovery an abuse of
the discovery process, and awards sanctions. 
The Court imposes sanctions against Defendant and its counsel of record,
Cozen O’Connor, in the amount of $1,650, which represents three hours of
attorney time to prepare the motions at $550 per hour.  Defendant and its counsel of record, Cozen
O’Connor, jointly and severally, are to pay sanctions in the amount of $1,650
to Plaintiff, by and through counsel, within 30 days of notice of this order.
Plaintiff is ordered
to provide notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
