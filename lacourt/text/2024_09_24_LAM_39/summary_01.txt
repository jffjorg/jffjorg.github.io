And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion to compel answers to deposition questions filed by plaintiff Veronica Mendez against defendants Guilford Glazer Properties, Inc. and The Diane and Guilford Glazer Foundation. The motion seeks to compel Deponent William Neiman, the Chief Executive Officer of Guilford Glazer Properties, Inc., to answer deposition questions. The defendants oppose the motion, arguing that the questions are intrusive on the privacy of their employees and that Deponent has already answered the questions. The judge finds that the defendants' counsel instructed Deponent not to answer questions without justification and that the questions do not implicate any privilege. As a result, the judge grants the motion to compel and orders Deponent to appear for a second session of the deposition within 30 days to answer the questions. The judge also awards sanctions against the defendants and their counsel in the amount of $2,750, representing five hours of attorney time to prepare the motion and attend the hearing.
