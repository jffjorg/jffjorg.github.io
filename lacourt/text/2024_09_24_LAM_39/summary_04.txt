And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash a subpoena served by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (Defendant) on Christopher Lee (Deponent), who is the brother-in-law and former co-worker of the plaintiff, Jane Doe. The plaintiff is seeking to quash the subpoena because it requires deposition testimony and the production of documents, which she claims is an invasion of her privacy. The judge has denied the motion to quash, finding that Deponent is a percipient witness in the case and that Defendant has a right to conduct discovery concerning what Plaintiff told Deponent about the alleged assault by her co-worker, Eric Pagel. The judge notes that Plaintiff's relationship with Deponent is private and sensitive information, but that Defendant may be entitled to discover information that is directly relevant to the litigation. The judge has also reserved the right to award reasonable expenses to the parties if the motion was made or opposed in bad faith or without substantial justification.
