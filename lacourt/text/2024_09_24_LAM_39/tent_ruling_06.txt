[1]Defendants
filed a second and separate motion for sanctions related to what they describe
as Plaintiff’s repeated claim Defendants had not paid the arbitration filing
fee and, therefore, Defendants had waived any entitlement to arbitration, and
the matter should be returned to this Court. 
The Court’s March 26, 2024 order did authorize Defendants to bring the
instant sanctions motion, but there was no mention of the stay being lifted for
the filing of a separate sanctions motion involving Plaintiff’s assertions
concerning Defendants’ failure to pay arbitration filing fees.  The Court declines to consider the second
sanctions motion, as no provision was made for Defendants to file it before
this Court while the stay is in place.
