And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a motion to quash a subpoena served on a treating gynecologist, Deponent Dr. Christine Djapri. The plaintiff, Jane Doe, seeks to quash the subpoena, while the defendant, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., opposes the motion. The judge finds that the motion is moot since the deposition has already taken place and the plaintiff did not serve the motion on the defendant until three minutes prior to the deposition. The judge also notes that the plaintiff was required to seek a protective order to preclude the deposition or limit its scope, rather than objecting to the deposition subpoena. As a result, the judge orders the plaintiff to give notice of this order and file proof of service.
