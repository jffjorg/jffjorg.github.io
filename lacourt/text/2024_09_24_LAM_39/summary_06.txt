```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' second motion for sanctions, which was filed related to the defendants' claims that the plaintiff repeatedly alleged they did not pay the arbitration filing fee. The court's previous order on March 26, 2024 authorized the defendants to bring a sanctions motion, but did not specify that they could file a separate motion regarding the plaintiff's assertions about the defendants' failure to pay the arbitration filing fee. As a result, the court declines to consider the second sanctions motion because it was not authorized to be filed while the stay is in place.
