to Tax Costs

Legal
Standard
 
In general, the “prevailing party” is entitled as a matter of right to
recover costs for suit in any action or proceeding. (CCP § 1032(b); Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17
Cal.4th 599, 606.) “Prevailing party” includes the party with a net
monetary recovery, a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered, a
defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief, and a
defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against
that defendant. (CCP § 1032 (a)(4).)
 
            “Allowable costs shall be reasonably
necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial
to its preparation.” (CCP § 1033.5(c)(2).) “If the items appearing in a cost
bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax
costs to show that they were not reasonable or necessary.” (Ladas v. California State Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774.) On
the other hand, if the items are properly objected to, they are put in issue
and the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as costs. (Ibid.)
 
            Unless objection is made to the
entire cost memorandum, the motion to strike or tax costs must refer to each
item objected to by the same number and appear in the same order as the
corresponding cost item claimed on the memorandum of costs and state why each
item is objectionable. (CRC rule 3.1700(b)(2).) Any grounds not stated are
waived. (Boyd v. Oscar Fisher Co. (1989) 210 Cal. App. 3d 368, 383.)
 
Analysis
 
Cross-Defendants Geringer Capital, Inc., Robert Geringer
and Tricycle Entertainment, Inc. move to strike Cross-Complainant Blue Rider
Finance Inc.’s memorandum of costs. Specifically, Cross-Defendants object to
item no. 4 ($2,763.86 for Printing and Copying of Briefs) because such
costs on appeal are not authorized by California Rules of Court (CRC), rule
8.278(d)(1)(E). Under this rule, a prevailing party on appeal is entitled to
“The cost to print and reproduce any brief, including any petition for
rehearing or review, answer, or reply[.]” However, based on the invoices, these
costs are not for the printing or reproduction of briefs, but instead costs
associated with a legal services firm, One Legal, to handle word processing
for the briefs and other items unrelated to printing/reproduction of briefs.
(See Kolber Decl., Ex. A.) As these are not generally recoverable costs,
Cross-Complainant has the burden of demonstrating why they are entitled to
these costs. Cross-Complainant fails to oppose the motion, and therefore fails
to meet this burden.
 
Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED.
