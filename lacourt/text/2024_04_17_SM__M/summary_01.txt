And here is the summary in English:

The case is a demurrer to the First Amended Complaint ("FAC") filed by the defendant, County of Los Angeles Development Authority ("LACDA"), against the plaintiff, Ashley. The defendant argues that the FAC does not state a cause of action and that the plaintiff failed to timely file a tort claim. The court finds that the FAC is sufficient to state a cause of action and that the plaintiff's failure to timely file a tort claim is not a defense to the claims against the defendant. The court also finds that the FAC does not plead with particularity the facts necessary to support a cause of action under Government Code Section 835 and that the defendant's demurrer to count three, which is the Dangerous Condition of Public Property cause of action, is sustained with leave to amend.
