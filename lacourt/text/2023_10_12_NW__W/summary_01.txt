And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Plaintiff SS's motion to lift the stay of proceedings. The stay was ordered on May 11, 2022, due to Defendant Niknia's ongoing criminal case involving Plaintiff SS and a violation of Penal Code section 289(D)(3). The Court finds that lifting the stay is in the interest of justice, as Plaintiff SS has not been able to conduct discovery against Defendant Niknia for over a year and may suffer prejudice if the stay remains. The Court notes that Defendant Niknia can invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege if necessary. The ruling allows the civil action to proceed, which may result in Plaintiff SS being compensated for her serious physical and emotional injuries.
