And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

In the case of Ellen S. Durant and David E. Durant vs. Constance Adler Galloway, Urban Bilial Carlisle, and Hanibal Design Carlisle, the judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' demurrer to the complaint and Constance Adler Galloway's motion to set aside default.

The judge sustains the demurrer to the complaint with leave to amend, finding that the complaint does not sufficiently state a cause of action against Urban Bilial Carlisle. However, the judge grants Constance Adler Galloway's motion to set aside default, finding that the default was entered in bad faith and that the parties could have avoided the default if they had properly communicated with each other.

The judge also notes that the complaint fails to allege whether the agreement between the parties is oral or written, as required by California law. The judge gives the parties leave to amend the complaint to correct this deficiency.

The case has been set for hearing on October 12, 2023, and the parties are directed to file any necessary papers in response to this tentative ruling.
