BACKGROUND
 
On March 10, 2023, Plaintiffs Ellen S.
Durant and David E. Durant filed a complaint against Defendants Constance Adler
Galloway, Hanibal Design Carlisle, and Urban Bilial Carlisle for breach of
contract, intentional misrepresentation, and financial elder abuse. Plaintiffs
allege Ellen, who is 89 years old, purchased a 3-bedroom condominium. David is
Ellen’s son. Plaintiffs further allege Constance befriended Ellen and Ellen
considered Constance like a daughter. Constance informed Ellen she could act as
a property manager for the condominium. Plaintiffs allege in 2020, Constance
signed a lease with Defendants Hanibal and Urban to rent one of the bedrooms in
the condominium. In 2021, Plaintiffs decided to sell the property. Shortly
thereafter, the friendship between Ellen and Constance deteriorated. Plaintiffs
allege then Constance orchestrated a police action, where police disrupted Ellen’s
convalescence and quiet enjoyment of the Property. Moreover, Constance accepted
rent from Defendants Hanibal and Urban against Plaintiffs’ wishes. Plaintiffs
wired $9,000 to Defendants Hanibal and Urban to have them vacate the property;
however, Hanibal and Urban have failed to vacate the property. 
 
Request for entry of default against
Defendant Hanibal Design Carlisle was entered on August 31, 2023.

DISCUSSION
 
I.                   
DEFENDANT URBAN BILIAL CARLISLE’S
DEMURRER TO THE COMPLAINT
 
Defendant Urban Bilial Carlisle demurs
to Plaintiffs’ complaint on the grounds the first cause of action fails to
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against Defendant Urban.

 
A demurrer is a pleading used to test
the legal sufficiency of other pleadings, i.e., it raises issues of law,
not fact, regarding the form or content of the opposing party’s pleading
(complaint, petition, answer, or cross-complaint).  (C.C.P. §§422.10, 589;
see Donabedian v. Mercury Insurance Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994
[citing text]; Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388
[citing text].) 
 
A demurrer can be used only to
challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack; or from
matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable.  (Blank v.
Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian, 116 Cal.App.4th at pg.
994 [citing text].) 
 
Defendant Urban first demurs to the
complaint on the grounds Plaintiffs fail to attach the contract or cite the
provisions of the contract verbatim. The court is unpersuaded by Defendant’s
argument that the terms of a written agreement must be set forth in verbatim in
the complaint. Defendant cites Miles v. Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. (2015)
236 Cal.App.4th 394 to support his contention. However, the quoted portion by
Defendant is in reference to Otworth v. Southern Pac. Transportation Co.
(1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 452. Since Otworth, the California Supreme Court
has held that “[i]n an action based on a written contract, a plaintiff may
plead the legal effect of the contract rather than its precise language.” (Construction
Protective Services, Inc. v. TIG Specialty Insurance Co. (2002) 29 Cal.4th
189, 198-99.) Moreover, Miles held “plaintiff's failure either to attach
or to set out verbatim the terms of the contract was not fatal to his breach of
contract cause of action.” (Miles v. Deutsche Bank National Trust Co.
(2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 394, 402.) The court in Miles found the plaintiff
alleged the basic elements of a breach of contract claim. Similarly here, Plaintiff
has alleged Plaintiffs and Defendants Hanibal and Urban entered into a vacate agreement
whereby Plaintiffs were to wire $9,000 and Defendants were to vacate; however,
after Plaintiffs wired the money, Defendants failed to vacate the unit. The
court does agree, however, the complaint fails to allege whether this is an
oral or written agreement as required under 430.30(g). 
 
Accordingly, Defendant Urban’s demurrer
to the complaint is SUSTAINED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND. 
 
II.                 
DEFENDANT CONSTANCE ADLER GALLOWAY’S
MOTION TO SET ASIDE DEFAULT
 
Defendant Constance Adler Galloway
moves the court to set aside the default entered against Galloway on the
grounds the default of Defendant Galloway was done in bad-faith and for the
sole purpose of wasting judicial resources as counsel for Plaintiffs had actual
notice that service of process was not valid at Defendant Galloway’s daughter’s
residence as Defendant Galloway never resided there and sought default although
in contact with Defense counsel. 
 
Section 473(d) provides that “[t]he
court may . . . on motion of either party after notice to the other party, set
aside any void judgment or order.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473(d).) A default
judgment is void against a defendant who was not served with a summons in the
manner prescribed by statute. (See Sakaguchi v. Sakaguchi (2009) 173
Cal.App.4th 852, 858.) Relief pursuant to section 473(d) may be made at any
time. (See Manson, Iver & York v. Black (2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 36,
42.)  
 
Defendant Galloway contends the service
was improper because Defendant Galloway did not reside at the residence where
substituted service occurs. Moreover, Defense counsel was in contact with
Plaintiff’s counsel regarding the issues with service. Had the parties properly
and openly communicated with each other this could have been avoided.  (See
Smith v. Los Angeles Bookbinders Union No. 63 (1955) 133 Cal.App.2d 486,
500 [“The quiet speed of plaintiffs’ attorney in seeking a default judgment
without the knowledge of defendants’ counsel is not to be commended.”] disapproved
on other grounds by MacLeod v. Tribune Pub. Co. (1959) 52 Cal.3d 536.) 
 
Despite receiving correspondence from Defense
counsel inquiring about service, Plaintiff has not done anything regarding the
request for default entered. As noted above, Defendant contends he has never
resided at his daughter’s residence where substituted service occurs. 
 
Accordingly, Defendant Galloway’s unopposed
motion to set aside default is GRANTED.
