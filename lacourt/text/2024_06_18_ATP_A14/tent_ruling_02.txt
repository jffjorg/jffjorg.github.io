 Case Number:  22AVCV01057    Hearing Date:   June 18, 2024    Dept:  A14 Background
 
This is a premises liability
action. Plaintiff Teresa Keily (“Plaintiff”) alleges that on April 04, 2022,
she went with her daughter to Defendant WinCo Holdings, Inc., a corporation, (“WinCo
Holdings”)’s premises located at 740 W. Avenue K4, Lancaster, CA 93534 (the “Premises”)
when she walked down an aisle and felt her foot slip, causing injury. 
 
On December 19, 2022, Plaintiff
filed her Complaint alleging two causes of action for: (1) General Negligence,
and (2) Premises Liability. The Court notes that the allegations within the two
causes of action are substantially different as the General Negligence cause of
action describes the incident as Plaintiff “felt her foot slip” whereas the
Premises Liability cause of action states that Plaintiff slipped due to a
liquid substance on the floor. (See Complaint Cause of Action Attachments.)
 
On January 13, 2023, Plaintiff
filed an amendment to the Complaint, amending the fictitious name of “Doe 1” to
WinCo Foods, LLC, a limited liability company. (“Defendant”) 
 
On January 23, 2023, WinCo Foods
filed its Answer.
 
On February 03, 2023, Plaintiff
filed a Request for Dismissal as to the Complaint, entered on the same date.
 
On September 12, 2023, Plaintiff
filed a Motion for Relief from Involuntary Dismissal based on Cal. Code Civ.
Proc. § 473(b), subsequently granted.
 
On October 10, 2023, Plaintiff
dismissed WinCo Holdings only.
 
On March 22, 2024, after two
continuances, an Informal Discovery Conference (“IDC”) was held. 
 
On April 08, 2024, Plaintiff
filed two motions: (1) a Motion to Compel Further Responses, Without
Objections, to Form Interrogatories (Gen – Set No. One) Nos. 12.1, 15.1, and
16.1-16.8 (“Compel Further Form Interrogatories”); and (2) a Motion to Compel
Further Responses, Without Objections, to Requests for Production of Documents
(Set One) Nos. 1, 3, 4, 9, and 15 (“Compel Further RFPs”).
 
On April 11, 2024, Plaintiff
filed a Motion to Compel Further Responses, Without Objections, to Special
Interrogatories (Set One) Nos. 7, 31-32 (“Compel Further Special
Interrogatories”). 
 
The Court notes that following
corresponding documents are filed on different dates from their motions: (1)
The Declaration and Separate Statement in Support of the Motion to Compel
Further Form Interrogatories are filed on April 11, 2024 when the motion was
filed on April 08, 2024; and (2) the Declaration and Separate Statement in
Support of the Motion to Compel Further Special Interrogatories were filed on
April 08, 2024 when the motion was filed on April 11, 2024. 
 
On April 22, 2024 Defendant filed
its Opposition to the Motion to Compel Further Form Interrogatories only.
 
No Oppositions have been received
for the remaining two motions. 
 
On June 05, 2024, Plaintiff filed
her Reply to Defendant’s Opposition to the Motion to Compel Further Form
Interrogatories only.

Legal Standard
 
Standard for Compelling Further Responses to
Requests for Production (“RFPs”) – “Unless otherwise limited by order of the court in accordance with
this title, any party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not
privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending
action or to the determination of any motion made in that action, if the matter
either is itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §
2017.010.)¿For discovery purposes, information is regarded as relevant “if it
might reasonably assist a party in evaluating the case, preparing for trial, or
facilitating settlement thereof.” (City of Los Angeles v. Superior Court¿(2017)
9 Cal.App.5th 272, 288.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
A motion to compel further responses to a
demand for inspection or production of documents (“RFP”) may be brought based
on: (1) incomplete statements of compliance; (2) inadequate, evasive, or
incomplete claims of inability to comply; or (3) unmerited or overly
generalized objections.¿ (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §¿2031.310(a).)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
Notice of the motion must be given within 45
days of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or
before any specific later date to which the demanding party and the responding
party have agreed in writing. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310(c).)¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
A motion to compel further production must
set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by
the inspection demand. (See Cal. Code Civ. Proc., §¿2031.310(b)(1).) In¿Digital
Music News LLC v Superior Court¿(2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 216 at 224, the
Court defined “good cause” as a showing that there¿is¿“a disputed fact that is
of consequence in the action and the discovery sought will tend in reason to
prove or disprove that fact or lead to other evidence that will tend to prove
or disprove the fact.”¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
If the moving party has shown good cause for
the requests for production, the burden is on the objecting party to justify
the objections. (Kirkland v.¿Sup. Ct¿(2002) 95 Cal. App.4th 92,
98.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
“The court shall limit the scope of
discovery if it determines that the burden, expense, or intrusiveness of that
discovery clearly outweighs the likelihood that the information sought will
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (Cal. Code of Civ.¿Proc. §
2017.020(a).) Generally, objections on the ground of burden require the
objecting party to produce evidence of (a) the propounding party’s subjective
intent to create burden, or (b) the amount of time and effort it would take to
actually respond. (See¿West Pico Furniture Co. of Los Angeles v. Superior
Court In and For Los Angeles County¿(1961) 56 Cal.2d 407, 417.) However,
where discovery is obviously overbroad on its face, no such evidence is
necessary. (See¿Obregon v. Superior Court¿(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th
424, 431.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
Trial courts are vested with “wide
discretion” to allow or prohibit discovery. (Williams v. Superior Court¿(2017)
3 Cal.5th 531, 540.)¿

Standard for
Compelling Further Interrogatories –Under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
2030.300, a court may order a party to serve a further response to
interrogatories when the court finds that any of the following apply:¿¿(1) an
answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete; (2) an exercise
of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the
required specification of those documents is inadequate; and (3) an objection
to an interrogatory is without merit or too general.¿(Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
2030.300(a).)¿Notice of the motion must be given within 45 days of the verified
response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific
later date to which the demanding party and the responding party have agreed in
writing. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.300(c).)¿¿”Each answer in a response to
interrogatories shall be as complete and straightforward as the information
reasonably available to the responding party permits.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
2030.220(a).) If an interrogatory cannot be answered completely, it shall be
answered to the extent possible and, if the responding party does not have
personal knowledge sufficient to respond fully to an interrogatory, that party
shall so state, but shall make a reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the
information by inquiry to other natural persons or organizations, except where
the information is equally available to the propounding party. (Id. at
(b)-(c).) “If only a part of an interrogatory is objectionable, the remainder
of the interrogatory shall be answered. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc § 2030.240(a).) If
an objection is made to an interrogatory or to a part of an interrogatory, the
specific ground for the objection shall be set forth clearly in the response.
If an objection is based on a claim of privilege, the particular privilege
invoked shall be clearly stated. If an objection is based on a claim that the
information sought is protected work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with
Section 2018.010), that claim shall be expressly asserted. (Id. at (b).)
 
-----
 
Meet and Confer
Requirement – Before filing a motion to compel further, the moving
party is required to meet and confer with the party to engage in a reasonable
and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the
motion. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §§ Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.300(b),
2033.290(b), 2016.040.)  A meet and
confer declaration in support of a motion shall state facts showing such an
attempt occurred. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2016.040.)  
 
All
declarations filed with the corresponding motions by Plaintiff’s counsel,
Mikayel Badalyan (“Badalyan”), discuss meet and confer attempts and the
Informal Discovery Conference (“IDC”) held by this Court. The Court’s minute
order for the IDC shows that Defendant did not appear and the Court allowed the
filing of these three motions. (See 03/22/2024 Minute Order.) 
 
-----
 
Discussion
 
Application – As an
initial matter, no Opposition has been filed for either the Motion to Compel
Further Discovery Responses to Special Interrogatories or the Motion to Compel
Further Discovery Responses to RFPs.
 
A failure to oppose a motion may
be construed as a concession on the merits. (See D.I. Chadbourne, Inc. v.
Superior Court (1964) 60 Cal.2d 723, 728, fn. 4 [where nonmoving party
fails to oppose a ground for a motion “it is assumed that [nonmoving party]
concedes” that ground].) 
 
Accordingly, (1) the Motion to
Compel Further Discovery Responses to Special Interrogatories is GRANTED; and
(2) the Motion to Compel Further Discovery Responses to RFPs is GRANTED. 
 
The Court turns to the only
contested motion: the Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form
Interrogatories. The Court notes that Defendant has not filed a Separate
Statement. The Court directs Defendant to California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345
which discusses separate statements for motions to compel further responses to
a demand for inspection of documents or tangible things and interrogatories. 
 
Form Interrogatory 12.1 
 
Form Interrogatory 12.1 reads:
 
State the name,
ADDRESS, and telephone number of each individual:
(a) who witnessed
the INCIDENT or the events occurring immediately before or after the INCIDENT;
(b) who made any
statement at the scene of the INCIDENT;
(c) who heard any
statements made about the INCIDENT by any individual at the scene; and
(d) who YOU OR
ANYONE ACTING ON YOUR BEHALF claim has knowledge of the INCIDENT (except for
expert witnesses covered by Code of Civil Procedure section 2034).
 
(Separate Statement 2:2-11.)
 
Defendant has responded:
 
Objection. This
interrogatory seeks information protected from discovery by the attorney work
product privilege insofar as it seeks identification of witnesses counsel
interviewed. Nacht & Lewis Architects, Inc. v. Superior Court (1996)
47 Cal.App.4th 214. Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections,
responding party is currently unaware of any witnesses to the incident other
than plaintiff.
 
(Separate Statement 2:12-17.) 
 
It appears that the objection is
not valid as Defendant has stated that the only party that it is aware of that is
responsive to Form Interrogatory 12.1’s requests is Plaintiff. 
 
Objection aside, it appears that Defendant
has answered the interrogatory based on the information available to it (see
Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.220), but not in the format required (see id.
at (b)). 
 
Accordingly, a further response
in a format that complies with Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §2030.220(b) is needed.
 
Form Interrogatory 15.1
 
Form Interrogatory 15.1 reads:
 
Identify each
denial of a material allegation and each special or affirmative defense in
your pleadings and
for each:
(a) state all
facts upon which you base the denial or special or affirmative defense;
(b) state the
names, ADDRESSES, and telephone numbers of all PERSONS who have knowledge of
those facts; and
(c) identify all
DOCUMENTS and other tangible things that support your denial or special or
affirmative defense, and
(d) state the
name, ADDRESS, and telephone number of the PERSON who has each DOCUMENT
 
(Separate 4:3-12.) 
 
Defendant has responded:
 
Objection. Proper
pleading requires that all potentially available affirmative defenses be
raised; and, as such, the affirmative defenses by this defendant are set forth
in its Answer to the Complaint. The facts upon which these defenses are based
have been, or will be, revealed in discovery. However, discovery into the
facts, circumstances and legal issues alleged in this matter has only just
begun. This responding defendant considers this interrogatory to have been
propounded prematurely, in that this responding party has not had sufficient
opportunity to make a reasonable investigation to ascertain facts relating to
the incident alleged, to the damages, if any, of plaintiff, and to the extent
of liability, if any, of this responding defendant. 
 
Further objection is
made in that this interrogatory is vague and ambiguous in its use of the phrase
"material allegation," as that term is defined in C.C.P. § 431.10(a),
insofar as it requires that defendant speculate as to those allegations of
plaintiff which are essential to the claim. Accordingly, defendants cannot
answer the interrogatory without guessing as to plaintiffs intentions in
drafting the complaint. 
 
Further, this
interrogatory is burdensome and oppressive in that it requires the responding
party to restate affirmative defenses which are set forth completely in the
Answer.
 
Further, this
interrogatory seeks information which is the work product of responding party's
counsel, insofar as it attempts to discover the facts upon which counsel has
identified and categorized his allegations of plaintiff s complaint. The
manner, method and approach utilized by counsel in the defense of this action
is not properly discoverable. This interrogatory seeks to discover the thought
processes of responding party's counsel by asking for an identification by
counsel of assessments of plaintiff s allegations as to materiality, followed
by a demand for disclosure of the underlying facts supporting this
determination. By obtaining this information, plaintiff will have discovered
the relationship between the base facts of the case and counsel's approach
thereto. It is the linkage between facts, the defenses selected, and counsel's
identification of allegations as material that provides the impermissible
insight into responding party's attorney's reasoning and thought processes
 
(Separate Statement 4:13-5:11.)
 
Third, the Court rejects
Defendants' argument that Form Interrogatory 15.1 is premature. Cal. Code Civ.
Proc. § 2030.020(b) authorizes a plaintiff to serve interrogatories without
leave of court at any time “that is 10 days after service of summons on, or
appearance by, that party, whichever occurs first.” Form Interrogatories were
propounded on June 02, 2023, nearly six months since service on WinCo Holdings,
Inc., after which Defendant responded. The fact that Defendant has not
completed their discovery does not relieve it of its obligation to respond to Plaintiff’s
discovery. To the extent Defendant argues it does not yet have facts or
information as to its denials or affirmative defenses, Defendant must still
provide a response to the interrogatory in accordance with Cal. Code Civ. Proc.
§ 2030.220. Subdivision (c) of that section specifically allows the responding
party to state that it does not have personal knowledge sufficient to fully
respond to an interrogatory. Further, Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.310 allows a
party to serve an amended answer to any interrogatory that contains information
subsequently discovered, inadvertently omitted, or mistaken stated.
 
The objection to the term
“material allegation” is not well taken. Form interrogatories are approved by
the Judicial Council of California. (See Exh. A [bottom left corner on each
page states: “Form Approved for Optional Use Judicial Council of California
DISC-001 [Rev. January 1, 2008]].) Further, Defendant concedes that it knows
the definition of the term. Defendant need not “speculate as to those
allegations of plaintiff which are essential to the claim” as presented as
Defendant is in receipt of Plaintiff’s Complaint, which contains Plaintiff’s
allegations. 
 
As to burdensome and oppressive, discovery burden
is “undue” only if the inconvenience and expense of responding clearly
outweighs the benefits likely to be obtained if the interrogatories are
answered. (Weil & Brown, CPG: Civ. Proc. Before Trial (TRG 2021)
§8:1475.13, citing Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §2031.210(d).) The objecting party is
required to provide evidence to support its claim of undue or excessive burden
that shows the amount of work required, otherwise, the trial court has nothing
“upon which to base a comparative judgment that any responsive burden would be undue
or excessive, relative to the likelihood of admissible evidence being
discovered.” (Id. [citing Williams v. Sup. Ct. (Marshalls of CA, LLC)
(2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 549-550].) Further, as held in West Pico Furniture Co.
v. Superior Court (1961) 56 Cal.2d 407, reiterated in Mead Reinsurance
Co. v. Superior Court (1986) 188 Cal.App.3d 313, 320-21, and incorporated
into CA Pretrial Civil Procedure: The Wagstaffe Group § 42-III, “[oppression]
must not be equated with burden [all discovery imposes some burden on the opposition].
. . . to support an objection of oppression there must be some showing . . .
that the ultimate effect of the burden is incommensurate with the result
sought.” Defendant has provided no separate statement nor an argument regarding
this matter in its Opposition. Accordingly, Defendant has not met its burden. 
 
As to the work product objection, “California's
civil work product privilege is codified in section 2018.030. Subdivision (a)
provides absolute protection to any ‘writing that reflects an attorney's
impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal research or theories.’ (§
2018.030, subd. (a).) Such a writing ‘is not discoverable under any
circumstances.’ (Ibid.) The term “writing” includes any form of recorded
information, including audio recordings. (§ 2016.020, subd. (c) [adopting the
definition set forth in Evid. Code, § 250].) Section 2018.030, subdivision (b)
provides qualified protection for all other work product. Such material ‘is not
discoverable unless the court determines that denial of discovery will unfairly
prejudice the party seeking discovery in preparing that party's claim or
defense or will result in an injustice.’ (§ 2018.030, subd. (b).)” (Coito v.
Superior Court (2012) 54 Cal.4th 480, 488 (“Coito”).) Here, the form
interrogatory is not subject to absolute protection. The Court notes that
Defendant has not made “a foundational showing that disclosure would reveal an
attorney's impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal research or theories.”
(Id. at 495-96; see also Opposition 5:13-14 [“It also objected that to
respond to this interrogatory would impermissibly invade the work product of
defense counsel”].) As to qualified protection, a list of Defendant’s
affirmative defenses, which defense counsel, Kelly Snowden (“Snowden”),
concedes has already been disclosed in the filed Answer does not appear to be
protected. As to Snowden’s other work-product objections, this form
interrogatory requests (1) facts upon which the affirmative defenses are based,
(2) information related to persons who have knowledge of these facts, (3)
documents that support the affirmative defenses or denials, and (4) information
related to persons who have the documents. Where an interrogatory asks about
the existence of a document, an objection on the ground of privilege is
improper, i.e., the document must be described although a privilege claim may
later be asserted concerning its contents. (Best Products, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Granatelli
Motorsports, Inc.) (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 1181, 1190.) The name of the
individual who provided the statement and identity of the person who obtained
the statement is not privileged information. Neither is the fact that a
statement exists. As to the list of potential persons with knowledge of the
facts, no showing has been made that these persons are protected by
work-product privilege. A party seeking to resist discovery based upon
objections has the burden to justify those objections. (Fairmont Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255, citing Coy v. Superior Court
(1962) 58 Cal.2d 220-221.) Defendant has not justified its objections.
 
Accordingly, a further response to Form
Interrogatory 15.1 is needed.
 
Form Interrogatory 16.1
 
Form Interrogatory 16.1 reads:
 
Do you contend
that any PERSON, other than you or plaintiff, contributed to the occurrence of
the INCIDENT or the injuries or damages claimed by plaintiff? If so, for each PERSON:
(a) state the
name, ADDRESS, and telephone number of the PERSON;
(b) state all
the facts upon which you base your contention;
(c) state the
names ADDRESSES, and telephone numbers of all PERSONS who have knowledge of the
facts; and
(d) identify all
DOCUMENTS and other tangible things that support your contention and state the
name, ADDRESS, and telephone number of the PERSON who has each DOCUMENT or
thing.
 
(Separate Statement 7:23-8:5.)
 
Defendant has responded:
 
Objection. Section
2(d) of the instructions to these interrogatories provides this series of
interrogatories should not be propounded until defendant has had a reasonable
opportunity to conduct investigation and discovery of plaintiff s claimed
injuries and damages, if any there are. Discovery has only begun in this
matter, and this responding defendant has not had enough time to assess and
evaluate plaintiffs injury claims. Thus, this question was propounded
prematurely and cannot be responded to. Responding party further objects that
this interrogatory seeks disclosure of information protected from disclosure by
the attorney work product doctrine and/or the attorney-client privilege.
Responding party further objects that it calls for a legal conclusion and for
the premature disclosure of expert witness opinion evidence.
 
(Separate Statement 8:6-15.)
 
The Court incorporates its
response for Form Interrogatory 15.1 as to 16.1 for the substantially similar
arguments (i.e., prematurely propounded and attorney work product doctrine.)
 
As to attorney-client privilege, “[i]n
general, when a party asserts the attorney-client privilege, that party has the
burden of showing the preliminary facts necessary to support the privilege…
After this burden is met, or where there is no dispute concerning the
preliminary facts, the burden shifts to the party opposing the privilege to
show either the claimed privilege does not apply, an exception exists, or there
has been an express or implied waiver. [Citation].” (Venture Law Group v.
Superior Court (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 96, 102 [internal citations
omitted].).” Defendant has failed to meet its initial burden of demonstrating
that the privilege of attorney-client relationship applies as it has neither
provided a separate statement nor discussed the privilege of attorney-client
relationship in its Opposition. 
 
As to
the argument that this interrogatory seeks legal conclusion and for the
premature disclosure of expert witness opinion evidence, the objection is
unfounded. This interrogatory requests information related to individuals and
documents only if Defendant believes any other person contributed to the
alleged incident. As to issues surrounding witness information and documents,
the Court incorporates its response for Form Interrogatory 15.1 as to 16.1 for
the relevant analysis.
 
Accordingly, a further response
to Form Interrogatory 16.2 is needed.
 
Form Interrogatories 16.2,
16.3, 16.4, and 16.5
 
Defendant’s response to these
interrogatories are identical to its response to Form Interrogatory 16.2. Because
of this, the Court incorporates its analysis, ante, for these
interrogatories. 
 
Accordingly, a further response
to Form Interrogatories 16.2, 16.3, 16.4, and 16.5 are needed.
 
Form
Interrogatories 16.6, 16.7, and 16.8
 
Plaintiff’s
Separate Statement does not discuss these form interrogatories. Plaintiff’s
moving papers simply discuss all interrogatories generally. No new evidence or
arguments on Reply regarding these interrogatories may be considered as they
were not presented in the moving papers. 
 
Accordingly,
no further response is needed for Form Interrogatories 16.6, 16.7, and 16.8.
 
Plaintiff Motion to Compel
Further Responses, Without Objections, to Form Interrogatories (Gen – Set No.
One) Nos. 12.1, 15.1, and 16.1-16.8 is GRANTED in part as to Form
Interrogatories (Gen – Set No. One) Nos. 12.1, 15.1, and 16.1-16.5 and DENIED
in part as to Form Interrogatories (Gen – Set No. One) Nos. 12.1, 15.1, and
16.6-16.8.

Sanctions
 
Plaintiff requests sanctions in
the amount of $2,000.00 [4 hrs @ $500.00.00/hr] for each motion. 
 
Regarding interrogatories, Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.300(d) provides: “The court shall impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a
further response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
 
 
 
Regarding RFPs, Cal. Code Civ.
Proc. § 2031.310(h) provides: “Except as provided in subdivision (j), the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel further response to a demand, unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”
 
Defendant has not opposed two out
of three motions. For the opposed motion, Defendant is unsuccessful in its
Opposition.
 
The Court notes that this request
for sanctions appears to trigger Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.050 which became
effective January 2024. Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.050 provides, in relevant
part:
 
Notwithstanding any
other law, and in addition to any other sanctions imposed pursuant to this
chapter, a court shall impose a one-thousand-dollar ($1,000) sanction, payable
to the requesting party, upon a party, person, or attorney if, upon reviewing a
request for a sanction made pursuant to Section 2023.040, the court finds any
of the following:
(1) The party,
person, or attorney did not respond in good faith to a request for the
production of documents made pursuant to Section 2020.010, 2020.410, 2020.510,
or 2025.210, or to an inspection demand made pursuant to Section 2031.010.
(2) The party,
person, or attorney produced requested documents within seven days before the
court was scheduled to hear a motion to compel production of the records
pursuant to Section 2025.450, 2025.480, or 2031.320 that is filed by the
requesting party as a result of the other party's, person's, or attorney's
failure to respond in good faith.
(3) The party,
person, or attorney failed to confer in person, by telephone, letter, or other
means of communication in writing, as defined in Section 250 of the Evidence
Code, with the party or attorney requesting the documents in a reasonable and
good faith attempt to resolve informally any dispute concerning the request.
 
(Cal. Code Civ.
Proc. § 2023.050(a).)
 
Accordingly, the Court imposes
sanctions in the amount of $2,500.00.
