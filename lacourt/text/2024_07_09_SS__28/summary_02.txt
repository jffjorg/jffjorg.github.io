And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Schueleke, Inc.'s motion to compel Plaintiff Alexander Hallstead to attend an independent medical examination with an orthopedic hip specialist. The motion was filed in response to Plaintiff's new claim for medically recommended future total hip replacement surgery. The judge found that Schueleke had not shown good cause to compel the examination, as Schueleke was aware of Plaintiff's ongoing hip pain and potential need for future hip surgery before the initial orthopedic examination in January 2024. The judge also noted that Schueleke chose to retain an orthopedic examining doctor who lacked expertise in hips.
