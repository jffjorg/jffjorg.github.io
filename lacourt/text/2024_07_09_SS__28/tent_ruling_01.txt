Proc., § 2025.450, subds. (a), (b), (g).)  DISCUSSION            Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.020, subdivision (a),  provides:  “(a) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, any  party shall be entitled as a matter of right to complete discovery proceedings  on or before the 30th day, and to have motions concerning discovery heard on or  before the 15th day, before the date initially set for the trial of the action.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020,  subd. (a).)  On  January 12, 2024, the Court continued the trial from February 28, 2024 to July  15, 2024 based on the parties’ stipulation.   The Court ordered that all deadlines and cut-off dates would be governed  by the new trial date.          Based  on Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.020, subdivision (a), and the Court’s  January 12, 2024 order, the last day for the Court to hear a motion concerning  discovery was 15 days before July 15, 2024.   Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiffs’ depositions is set for hearing 6  days before July 15, 2024.  Therefore,  the Court cannot hear Defendant’s motion.            The Court denies the motion without prejudice.  CONCLUSION  The Court DENIES without prejudice Defendant Los Angeles Dodgers LLC’s motion to compel Plaintiffs’  depositions and for sanctions.  Moving  party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Moving  party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court  within five days.
