And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge is considering a motion for summary adjudication filed by Marshalls, a defendant in a lawsuit brought by Alicia Lugo and German Frausto, who claim to have been injured due to a dangerous condition on the premises of Marshalls. The judge has considered the evidence and arguments presented by both parties and concludes that the allegedly dangerous condition was open and obvious, and therefore, Marshalls did not owe Lugo a duty to remedy or warn of the condition. The judge grants Marshalls' motion for summary adjudication, dismissing Lugo's negligence and premises liability claims.
