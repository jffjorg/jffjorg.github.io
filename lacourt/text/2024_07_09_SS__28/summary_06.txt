The judge is granting the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's deposition and imposing sanctions on the plaintiff. The plaintiff failed to appear at the deposition, despite multiple rescheduling attempts. The judge finds that the defendant has shown good cause for the production of documents and that the plaintiff has not acted with substantial justification. The judge orders the plaintiff to attend the deposition and produce documents by August 8, 2024, and awards $380.34 in sanctions to the defendant. The judge also orders the plaintiff and his counsel to pay the defendant the awarded amount by August 8, 2024.
