And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has considered the motion filed by the Defendant, Los Angeles Dodgers LLC, to compel the Plaintiffs' depositions and impose sanctions. The motion was filed on June 7, 2024, and is scheduled to be heard on July 9, 2024. However, the judge has determined that the motion was filed too late, as the deadline for hearing discovery motions was 15 days before the new trial date of July 15, 2024. Therefore, the judge denies the motion without prejudice, allowing the Defendant to re-file the motion if necessary.
