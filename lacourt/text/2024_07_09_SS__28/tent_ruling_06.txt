LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2025.450 provides in part:

or a person designated by an organization that is a party under Section
2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails
to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order
compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for
inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice. 
“(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with
both of the following: 
“(1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the production for inspection of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice. 
“(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to

 “(g) (1) If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted,
the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against
the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the
court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust. 
“(2) On motion of any other party who, in person or by
attorney, attended at the time and place specified in the deposition notice in
the expectation that the deponent’s testimony would be taken, the court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
in favor of that party and against the deponent or the party with whom the
deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust. . . .”

DISCUSSION 
On
July 25, 2023, Defendant noticed Plaintiff’s deposition for October 25, 2023.  Defendant later re-noticed the deposition for
January 17, 2024.  The parties explored possible
alternative dates for the deposition but did not agree on a date.  Plaintiff did not appear at the January 17,
2024 deposition.  Afterward, Defendant
met and conferred with Plaintiff’s counsel about Plaintiff’s non-appearance.  The parties rescheduled the deposition for
February 15, 2024, but on February 13, 2024 Plaintiff’s counsel stated he was
ill and would provide alternative dates at a later time.  Plaintiff’s counsel has not provided
alternative dates and Defendant has not taken Plaintiff’s deposition. 
 The Court grants the motion.

at a rate of $160.17 per hour, one hour of legal assistant time at a rate of
$75.00 per hour, and one $60.00 filing fee. 
Counsel spent two hours to meet and confer, review the motion and
declaration, and appear at the hearing. 
The Court does not award fees for legal assistant time.  The Court awards $380.34 in sanctions based
on two hours of attorney time and one filing fee.
