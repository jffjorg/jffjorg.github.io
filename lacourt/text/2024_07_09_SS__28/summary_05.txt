Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Court has considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers in this case. The Plaintiff, Raffi Semerjian, filed an action against the Defendants, Jhonathan Duenas and U-Haul, on March 10, 2023. The Defendants filed an answer on April 28, 2023, and June 14, 2023, respectively. On June 7, 2024, the Defendants filed a motion to continue the trial and all trial-related dates to be heard on July 9, 2024.

The Court finds good cause for a continuance, but the Defendants have not shown that a six-month continuance is needed. Therefore, the Court grants the motion in part and continues the trial to December 18, 2024. All related dates will be based on the new trial date. The Court denies the motion in all other respects.
