And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the papers filed in this case and is issuing a tentative ruling. The case involves a dispute between the Navarro family (Benito and Valentina) and Weho Collision Center over premises liability, negligence, and other claims. The Navarros had requested attorney's fees as part of their complaint, but Weho Collision Center has moved to strike this request. The judge has considered the relevant laws and case law and has concluded that the Navarros have not pleaded facts showing that they are entitled to attorney's fees based on contract, statute, or other source of law. Therefore, the judge grants Weho Collision Center's motion to strike the request for attorney's fees and gives the Navarros 30 days to amend their complaint.
