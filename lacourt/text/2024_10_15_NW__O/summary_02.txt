And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion for summary judgment brought by the defendant. The judge will grant the motion if the papers submitted show that there are no triable issues of material fact and that the defendant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. If the motion is granted, the causes of action, affirmative defenses, or claims for damages will be deemed established and the action will proceed as to the remaining issues. The judge is relying on California Code of Civil Procedure ยง 437c(c), (n)(1) in making this determination.
