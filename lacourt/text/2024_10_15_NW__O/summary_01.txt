And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants Plaintiff National Oak Distributors, Inc.'s motion for summary adjudication on its claim for common counts against Defendant J & S Auto Body Supply, Inc. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff has met its burden on summary adjudication, having submitted evidence that would require a reasonable trier of fact to find any underlying material fact more likely than not. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff has established that it provided automotive related goods to the Defendant between February 27, 1995, and November 1, 2022, and that the Defendant owes the Plaintiff $96,527.54. The Judge also finds that the Defendant's failure to pay the Plaintiff constitutes a breach of the "Business Credit Application" between the parties. Since the Defendant did not submit an opposition, the Judge concludes that the Defendant has not met its burden to create a triable issue of material fact.
