     CASE NO.: 23VECV03509
 
ORDER
  GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY ADJUDICATION
 



 
I.              
BACKGROUND 
This case
arises out of a contract between Plaintiff National Oak Distributors, Inc.
(“Plaintiff”) and J & S Auto Body Supply, Inc. (“Defendant”). Plaintiff
alleges it and Defendant entered into an agreement “whereby Plaintiff would
provide automotive related goods and for which Defendants promised to pay
Plaintiff” but that Defendants have not paid the amount due under the agreement.
(See Complaint, pg. 3, ¶ BC-2.)
Plaintiff now
moves for summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication as to its
second cause of action for Common Counts.
II.           
PROCEDURAL
HISTORY
On August 10,
2023, Plaintiff filed its Complaint, alleging (1) Breach of Contract; and (2)
Common Counts.
On October
24, 2023, Defendant filed its Answer. 
On July 12,
2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for Summary Judgment or Summary
Adjudication (“Motion”). 
Defendant did
not file an opposition. 
III.        
LEGAL STANDARD
The function
of a motion for summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as
to whether an opposing party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or
claim and to enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (See
Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) In
analyzing such motions, courts must apply a three-step analysis: “(1) identify
the issues framed by the pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has
negated the opponent’s claims; and (3) determine whether the opposition has
demonstrated the existence of a triable, material factual issue.” (Hinesley
v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.) Thus, summary
judgment or summary adjudication is granted when, after the Court’s
consideration of the evidence set forth in the papers and all reasonable
inferences accordingly, no triable issues of fact exist, and the moving party
is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(c)[1]; Villa
v. McFarren (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 733, 741.) 
As to each
claim as framed by the complaint, the party moving for summary judgment or
summary adjudication must satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting
facts to negate or establish an essential element. (See Scalf v. D.B.
Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Courts “liberally
construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and
resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v.
Arnold Worldwide, Inc.¿(2006) 39
Cal.4th 384, 389.) A motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication must
be denied where the moving party’s evidence does not prove all material facts,
even in the absence of any opposition or where the opposition is weak. (See
Leyva v. Superior Court (1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 462, 475; Salesguevara v.
Wyeth Labs., Inc. (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 379, 384 & 387.) When a
plaintiff is the moving party, the plaintiff has a higher burden: it must “present
evidence that would require a reasonable trier of fact to find any underlying
material fact more likely than not.” (See Aguilar, 25
Cal.4th at 845 (emphasis added).) “The burden of the moving party is to persuade
the court that there is no material fact for a reasonable trier of fact to find.”
(PP Mortgage, Ltd. v. Bizar (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 773, 776 (emphasis in
original) (cleaned up).) 
Once the
moving party has met its burden, the burden shifts to the opposing party to
show via specific facts that a triable issue of material fact exists to a cause
of action or a defense thereto. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(o)(2).)
IV.         
ANALYSIS
A.            
Request for Judicial Notice 
The Court
GRANTS Plaintiff’s Request for Judicial Notice of its Complaint and Defendant’s
Answer.   
B.            
Undisputed Material Facts
Between February 27, 1995, to November
1, 2022, Plaintiff provided automotive related goods to Defendant. (See Plaintiff’s
Separate Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (“UMF”) No. 3.) Despite
Plaintiff’s demands for payment, Defendant refused to pay for all goods
received and currently owes Plaintiff $96,527.54. (See UMF No. 4.) In its
responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Admissions (“RFAs”), Defendant admitted
Plaintiff issued it $96,527.54 in credit; that within the last four years, it
utilized the credit provided to it; and that within the last four years it
failed to pay Plaintiff the $96,527.54 it owes. (See UMF Nos. 7-9.)  
C.            
Plaintiff
is Entitled to Summary Adjudication on Plaintiff’s Common Count Claim.
Plaintiff
“respectfully requests that the Court grant summary judgment in favor of
Plaintiff on Plaintiff’s Cause of Action for Common Counts. In the alternative,
Plaintiff respectfully requests that Plaintiff’s Common Count Cause of Action
against Defendant be summarily adjudicated.” (Motion, pg. 1.) Plaintiff also requests
summary adjudication as to Defendant’s general denial in its Answer. (See id.
at 6-7.) 
As an
initial matter, Plaintiff in its Complaint asserts breach of contract and common
counts; however, Plaintiff’s only moves for summary judgement or summary
adjudication on its common counts claim. (See id. at 1.) Because
Plaintiff is not attempting to dispose of all its claims, Plaintiff is only requesting
summary adjudication.[2]
The Court also notes Plaintiff’s request for summary adjudication of
Defendant’s general denial in its Answer is procedurally improper. “A motion
for summary adjudication shall be granted only if it completely disposes of a
cause of action, an affirmative defense, a claim for damages, or an issue of
duty.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(f)(1).) A general denial in an answer is not a
cause of action, an affirmative defense, a claim for damages, or an issue of
duty and is therefore not the proper subject of a motion for summary adjudication.
 
The
Court now turns its attention to the merits of Plaintiff’s Motion. “A common
count is not a specific cause of action, . . . rather, it is a simplified form
of pleading normally used to aver the existence of various forms of monetary
indebtedness, including that arising from an alleged duty to make restitution
under an assumpsit theory.” (McBride v. Boughton (2004) 123
Cal.App.4th379, 394 (internal citations omitted).) “The only essential
allegations of a common count are (1) the statement of indebtedness in a
certain sum, (2) the consideration, i.e., goods sold, work done, etc., and (3)
nonpayment.” (Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Zerin (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 445,
460 (internal quotations and citations omitted).)
Plaintiff
has submitted evidence that would require a reasonable trier of fact to find
any underlying material fact more likely than not and has thus met its burden
on summary adjudication. Plaintiff has submitted its statement of account which
shows Defendant owes $96,527.54.
(See Declaration of Alexander Hettena filed July 12, 2024 (“Hettena
Decl.”), ¶ 2, Ex. A.) Plaintiff has also submitted its discovery requests and
Defendant’s responses, whereby Defendant admits: (1) it is a corporation
operating by the name J & S AUTO BODY SUPPLY, INC.; (2) that on February
27, 1995, it signed "Business Credit Application”; (3) that on February
27, 1995, it entered into a written contract with Plaintiff per the "Business
Credit Application"; (4) that the attached marked Exhibit "A" is
a true and correct copy of the "Business Credit Application"; (5) that
per the terms of the "Business Credit Application" it manifested your
assent to the term "'Buyer agrees to pay interest at the rate of 1 1/2%
per month on the unpaid balance after 30 days, and seller costs of collection
including reasonable attorney's fees"; (6) that the attached marked
Exhibit "B" is a true and correct copy of the Statement of Account
dated November 1, 2022, reflecting an outstanding balance of $96,527.54; (7) that
it was issued $96,527.54 in credit provided by Plaintiff; (8) that within the
last four years, it utilized the credit provided by Plaintiff; (9) that within
the last four years, it failed to pay Plaintiff $96,527.54 due; (1) that it
breached the terms of the "Business Credit Application" when it
failed to pay Plaintiff $96,527.54; and (11) that it owes Plaintiff $96,527.54
for the credit provided by Plaintiff. (See Hettena Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. C,
RFAs; ¶ 5, Ex. D, Defendant’s Reponses to RFAs.)
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff has
met its burden on summary adjudication. Therefore, the burden shifts to Defendant
to create a triable issue of material fact. Defendant did not submit an
opposition. Therefore, Defendant has not met its burden.  
V.            
CONCLUSION
Based on the
foregoing, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Adjudication as to its
claim for common counts. 
          IT
IS SO ORDERED.
