And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motions to compel further responses from the defendants. The plaintiff had sought to compel Jaguar and AutoNation to provide further responses to his requests for production of documents. The judge found that the plaintiff's requests were overbroad and did not provide sufficient guidance for the defendants to provide more specific responses. The judge also found that the defendants had made sufficient objections to the requests, citing that the requests were overly broad, irrelevant, and/or sought trade secrets. The judge noted that the plaintiff had not made a reasonable attempt to tailor his requests and declined to do so without more guidance. The judge appreciated the professionalism of counsel throughout their interactions and encouraged others to follow their example.
