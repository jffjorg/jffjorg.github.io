And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to quash service of the plaintiff's complaint. The defendant argued that the plaintiff failed to serve it in a code-complaint manner, as required by Government Code section 915. The proof of service filed by the plaintiff does not state who was served, and the court finds that the service was not made in compliance with the code. The court also notes that the defendant's Board Policy 3810 designates the Recording Secretary as the person to receive service, and the plaintiff did not serve anyone at that address. The court denies the plaintiff's motion to enter the previously timely filed default against the defendant as moot, and denies the plaintiff's motion to reclassify without prejudice as the plaintiff has failed to comply with the court's previous order to file an amended complaint.
