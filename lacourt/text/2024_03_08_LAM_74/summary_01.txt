  - "If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action . . . without having served a valid objection . . . fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, the party giving notice may move for an order compelling the deponent's attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted Plaintiff Glenn Feldman's motion to compel Defendant Fraser Ross and Kitross Apparel Los Angeles, LLC's (Defendant) Person Most Qualified (PMQ) to appear at deposition and produce documents. The court finds that Plaintiff has demonstrated good cause for the testimony and documents sought, and that Defendant waived any objections to the noticed deposition by serving objections late. The court also finds that Defendant lacked substantial justification to oppose the motion. As a result, the court grants Plaintiff's request for sanctions, ordering Defendant to pay Plaintiff's counsel attorney's fees in the sum of $1,020 and to appear for deposition and produce documents within 30 days.
