Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the Defendants, Kaivan Nownejad and Saturn New Generation LLC, in response to the Second Amended Complaint filed by the Plaintiffs, W. Bruce Edward Altschuld and Camille Altschuld.

The Judge has sustained the demurrer to the Eighth Cause of Action, which alleges a violation of California Civil Code §1942.4, without leave to amend. The Judge has found that the Plaintiffs have failed to allege facts sufficient to support this claim, as they have not shown that the Defendants received written notice from a public officer or employee responsible for enforcing housing laws.

The Judge has overruled the demurrer to the Ninth Cause of Action, which alleges elder abuse, and has found that the Plaintiffs have stated facts that meet the heightened standard of pleading or malicious conduct for elder abuse and neglect.

The Judge has overruled the demurrer to the Tenth Cause of Action, which alleges fraud, and has found that the Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to support this claim. Specifically, the Plaintiffs have alleged that Defendant Nownejad made misrepresentations to them prior to signing the lease.

The Judge has overruled the demurrer to the Eleventh Cause of Action, which alleges a breach of the statutory requirement to return the security deposit, and has found that the Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to support this claim.

The Judge has denied the motion to strike, which sought to strike portions of the Second Amended Complaint on the grounds that it fails to state sufficient facts to sustain its allegations for punitive damages and attorney's fees. The Judge has found that the punitive damages allegations are sufficient for the purposes of a motion to strike.

Overall, the Judge has determined that the Plaintiffs have stated sufficient facts to support their causes of action, with the exception of the Eighth Cause of Action, which alleges a violation of California Civil Code §1942.4.
