And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant/cross-defendant, Hossein Amiri, has moved the court to strike portions of the cross-complaint filed by the defendant/cross-claimant, Nader Farsar, including paragraph 3 and Farsar's request for attorney fees. The court grants Amiri's motion, finding that the inclusion of attorney fees is improper matter as Farsar has not established any grounds for a request for attorney fees. The court notes that Farsar's claims are based on equitable indemnity and contribution, which do not include a right to attorney fees.
