And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the motion by the County of Los Angeles to compel responses to form interrogatories and demand for inspection, as well as sanctions in the amount of $1,125.00 against Frances Villegas for her failure to respond to the discovery requests. The judge finds that Villegas was served with the discovery requests on March 6, 2023, and failed to provide responses despite multiple extensions of the deadline. The judge concludes that Villegas's failure to respond to discovery requests is a misuse of the discovery process and awards sanctions against her.
