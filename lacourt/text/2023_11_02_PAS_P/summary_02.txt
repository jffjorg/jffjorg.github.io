Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Harlan Johnson vs. Barri Whittaker, Case No. 23PDUD03585. The case is an unlawful detainer action, alleging that Whittaker failed to pay rent of $1,750.00 and has not left the premises. The Complaint was filed on October 11, 2023, and Whittaker responded by filing a demurrer on October 20, 2023.

The Judge has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, finding that the Complaint is defective and uncertain. The Complaint alleges two different amounts in past due rent, which is uncertain and unclear. Additionally, the Complaint seeks amounts due more than one year from when it was filed, which is untimely and defective.

The Judge has granted plaintiff 5 days to amend the Complaint and has ordered that notice of this ruling be given to Whittaker. The Judge has also provided additional analysis to the parties, finding that the address discrepancy between the Complaint and the 3-Day Notice is not sufficient to sustain the demurrer for uncertainty.
