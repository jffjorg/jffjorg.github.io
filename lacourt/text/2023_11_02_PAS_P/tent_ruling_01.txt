[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO INTERROGATORIES AND DEMAND FOR
  INSPECTION
 
Date:   November
  2, 2023
Time:  8:30 a.m.
Dept.:  P



 
          
          I.        INTRODUCTION
This
action concerns an injury Plaintiff Frances Villegas (Villegas) alleges she
sustained as a result of paramedics improperly handling her and her transport
to an ambulance. On January 6, 2022, Villegas alleges she fell in her home and
paramedics were called. She then alleges that the paramedics attempted to pick
her up and she fell a second time as a result, fracturing her right shoulder.
Villegas further alleges that the paramedics failed to follow a supervisor’s order
to wait for a hard gurney to transport her as her body is compromised due to lupus.
Defendant County of Los Angeles (County) employed the two paramedics who
allegedly injured Villegas.
Before the Court are
motions to compel responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One and Demand for
Inspection, Set One served by Defendant County on Villegas. County served Villegas
with Form Interrogatories, Set One and Demand to
Produce Certain Documents and Items,
Set One. Villegas has not filed responses to either set of discovery. County is
therefore entitled to the relief requested. The motions compelling a response
to the form interrogatories and the demand for inspection are GRANTED.  The motions for sanctions are GRANTED. 
          
II.       LEGAL
STANDARD
 “Any party may obtain discovery regarding any
matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the
pending action.” (CCP § 2017.010.)

“Within
30 days after the service of interrogatories, the party to whom the
interrogatories are propounded shall serve the original of the response to them
on the propounding party[.]” (CCP § 2030.260(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories were directed fails to serve a timely
response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling responses
without objections. (CCP § 2030.290(b).) If a party to whom interrogatories
were directed fails to serve a timely response, they waive the right to any
objections to the interrogatories. (CCP § 2030.290(a).) 
"Within 30 days after service of a demand for
inspection, the party to whom the demand is directed shall serve the original
of the response to it on the party making the demand.” (CCP § 2031. 260(a).) If
a party to whom the demand for inspection fails to serve a timely response,
they waive the right to any objections to the demand. (CCP § 2031.300(a).) The
party who made the demand may then move for an order compelling response to the
inspection demand. (CCP § 2031.300(b).)
“The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering
that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney
advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” (CCP §
2023.030(a).) Misuse of the discovery process includes: “(d) failing to respond
or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.” (CCP § 2023.010(d).) Reasonable
expenses under CCP section 2023.030(a) include the time spent in researching
and preparing the motion, as well as court time and travel time spent in
connection with the motion. (Ghanooni
v. Super Shuttle (1993) 20
Cal.App.4th 256, 262.)
 
          III.     ANALYSIS
A. Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories,
Set One
          i. Motion 
County presents evidence
that on March 6, 2023, it served Villegas by mail and by electronic service
with Form Interrogatories, Set One. The responses were due April 10, 2023. County
presents evidence that its counsel extended the deadline to respond to April
25, 2023. (Motion to Compel Responses to Interrogatories, p. 4: 11-14,
referencing Thomas Decl., p. 9: 23-27.) Villegas did not provide responses.
County presents evidence that its counsel emailed Plaintiff’s counsel on July
29, 2023 and extended the deadline for responses to August 4, 2023. (Thomas
Decl., p. 9: 28-p.10: 1-5.) Plaintiff’s counsel indicated that responses would
be filed by August 11, 2023. (Motion to Compel Responses to Interrogatories,
p.4: 15-20, referencing Exh. 2.) No responses have been received as of the
filing of this motion, September 6, 2023. 
Based
on the above evidence, County has established that Villegas was served with Form
Interrogatories, Set One. Villegas has not provided responses. Pursuant to CCP
section 2030.290(b), the Court grants the motion to compel responses to the interrogatories.
ii. Sanctions
County alleges that Villegas’s failure to provide
responses to its discovery request constitutes a misuse of the discovery
process. (Motion to Compel Responses to Interrogatories, p. 6: 7-9.) This
argument is well-taken. Despite multiple extensions of the deadline in which to
respond, Plaintiff Villegas has not provided responses to the form
interrogatories. Failing to respond to discovery is a misuse of the discovery
process. (CCP § 2023.010(d).)
County requests monetary sanctions in the amount of
$2,475.00 to be assessed against Villegas. County supports its request with the
declaration of counsel, Allen L. Thomas. (Thomas Decl.) Thomas declares that
his hourly rate is $450. (Thomas Decl. p. 10: 12-17.) Thomas declares that he
has spent 1.5 hours preparing the motion and anticipates 1 hour to review the
opposition and 3 hours to appear at the hearing. The Court finds the hourly
rate requested reasonable. The Court declines to grant sanctions for time not
spent reviewing the opposition, however, as the motion is unopposed. The Court
also declines to grant 3 hours of time to attend the hearing and finds 1 hour
is a more appropriate amount of time. In total, the Court awards sanctions for 2.5
hours of attorney time, 2.5 x $450/hr= $1,125.00.
          Accordingly, the Court awards County
sanctions in the amount of $1,125.00. 
 
B. Motion to Compel Response to Demand
to Produce Certain Documents and Items, Set One
          i. Motion 
County presents evidence
that on March 6, 2023, it also served Villegas by mail and by electronic
service with Demand to Produce Certain Documents and Items, Set One. Responses
were due April 10, 2023. County presents evidence that its counsel extended the
deadline to respond to April 25, 2023. (Motion to Compel Responses Demand
Produce, p. 4: 11-14, referencing Thomas Decl., p. 9: 23-27.) Villegas did not
provide responses. County presents evidence that its counsel emailed
Plaintiff’s counsel on July 29, 2023 and extended the deadline for responses to
August 4, 2023. (Thomas Decl., p. 9: 28-p.10: 1-5.) Plaintiff’s counsel
indicated that responses would be filed by August 11, 2023. (Motion to Compel
Responses Demand Produce, p.4: 15-20, referencing Exh. 2.) No responses have
been received as of the filing of this motion, September 6, 2023.
Based
on the above evidence, County has established that Villegas was served with Demand
to Produce Certain Documents and Items, Set One. Villegas has not provided
responses. Pursuant to CCP section 2031.300(b), the Court grants the motion to
compel responses to the demand for inspection.
ii. Sanctions
County alleges that Villegas’s failure to provide
responses to its discovery request constitutes a misuse of the discovery
process. (Motion to Compel Responses Demand Produce, p. 6: 2-4.) This argument
is well-taken. Despite multiple extensions of the deadline in which to respond,
Plaintiff Villegas has not provided responses to the form interrogatories. Failing
to respond to discovery is a misuse of the discovery process. (CCP §
2023.010(d).)
County requests monetary sanctions in the amount of
$2,475.00 to be assessed against Villegas. County supports its request with the
declaration of counsel, Allen L. Thomas. (Thomas Decl.) Thomas declares that
his hourly rate is $450. (Thomas Decl. p. 10: 12-17.) Thomas declares that he
has spent 1.5 hours preparing the motion and anticipates 1 hour to review the
opposition and 3 hours to appear at the hearing. The Court finds the hourly
rate requested reasonable. The Court declines to grant sanctions for time not
spent reviewing the opposition, as the motion is unopposed. The Court also
declines to grant 3 hours of time to attend the hearing and finds 1 hour is a
more appropriate amount of time. In total, the Court awards sanctions for 2.5
hours of attorney time, 2.5 x $450/hr= $1,125.00.
          In sum, the Court awards County
sanctions in the amount of $1,125.00. 
IV.     CONCLUSION

          The motion by Defendant County of Los Angeles for an order compelling
responses to form interrogatories is GRANTED. The motion by Defendant County of
Los Angeles for an order compelling sanctions is GRANTED in the amount of $1,125.00.
