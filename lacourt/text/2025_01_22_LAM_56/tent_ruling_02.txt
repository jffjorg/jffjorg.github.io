MOVING PARTY:  Counsel Dennis P. Block, Dennis P. Block &
Associates (“Counsel”)
RESPONDING PARTY: None
 
            The Court has considered the moving papers.

 
BACKGROUND
             This is an unlawful detainer action. On
September 9, 2024, plaintiff Jose Olivares (“Plaintiff”) filed the operative
complaint (“Complaint”) against defendants Felipe Pena and Griselda Pena
(collectively “Defendants”).
            
            On December 26, 2024, Dennis Block
of Dennis Block & Associates filed this motion to be relieved as counsel for
Plaintiff (the “Motion”). The grounds for this motion are thet “[t]he
attorney-client relationship between plaintiff and attorneys has irrevocably
broken down so as to not allow attorneys to effectively prosecute the above
matter.”  (Declaration of Dennis P. Block
in support of the Motion, ¶2.)  
 
The Court notes that this Motion was filed
on December 26, 2024 with a Final Status Conference (“FSC”) set for January 22,
2025 and a trial date of January 29, 2025. 
To have this Motion heard before the trial, counsel had to bring a
successful ex parte application to advance the hearing date.   The
Motion is set for the same time as the FSC and is unopposed. Trial is a week
away.
 
DISCUSSION
Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section
284 states that “the attorney in an action…may be changed at any time before or
after judgment or final determination, as follows: (1) upon the consent of both
client and attorney…; (2) upon the order of the court, upon the application of
either client or attorney, after notice from one to the other.”¿ (CCP § 284;
California Rules of Court (“CRC”) 3.1362.)¿ The withdrawal request may be
denied if it would cause an injustice or undue delay in proceeding; but the court's
discretion in this area is one to be exercised reasonably.¿ (Mandell v.
Superior (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 1, 4; Lempert¿v. Superior Court (2003)
112 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1173.)¿
 
In making a motion to be relieved as
counsel, the attorney must comply with procedures set forth in Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362.¿ The motion must be made using mandatory forms:¿ 
¿ 

Notice of
     Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel directed to the client
     (MC-051);¿ 


Declaration
     “stating in general terms and without compromising the confidentiality of
     the attorney-client relationship” the reasons that the motion was brought
     (MC-052);¿and 


Proposed
     Order (MC-053).¿ 

¿ 
The forms must be timely filed and served
on all parties who have appeared in the case.¿ (CRC rule 3.1362.)¿ If these
documents are served on the client by mail, there must be a declaration stating
either that the address where client was served is “the current residence or
business address of the client” or “the last known residence or business
address of the client and the attorney has been unable to locate a more current
address after making reasonable efforts to do so within 30 days before the
filing of the motion to be relieved.”¿ (CRC rule 3.1362 subd. (d)(1).)¿ 
The court has discretion as to whether to
allow an attorney to withdraw, and a motion to withdraw will not be granted
where withdrawal would prejudice the client. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant
(1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  Withdrawal is generally permitted unless
there is a compelling reason to continue the representation.  (Heple v.
Kluge (1951) 104 Cal.App.2d 461, 462.)  
 
Counsel filed a filed a Notice of Motion
and Motion (MC-051), Declaration in Support of Motion (MC-052) and Proposed
Order (MC-053). As reason for the Motion, Counsel states: “The attorney-client
relationship between plaintiff and attorneys has irrevocably broken down so as
to not allow attorneys to effectively prosecute the above matter. It follows
logically that we should be removed as attorneys of record. Any further
evidence may be subject to the attorney-client privilege and will be disclosed,
if necessary, in camera.” (MC-052, ¶ 2.) The forms were served on the client
and Defendants via overnight delivery on December 26, 2024. (All POS-040.)
Counsel confirmed via telephone in the last 30 days that the client’s address is
current. (MC-052, ¶ 3(b)(1)(b)) 
 
The Court notes that trial in this action
is currently set for January 29, 2025. Thus, the Court finds that the Motion does
not sets forth an adequate basis for withdrawal this close to trial.   Plaintiff could not reasonably be expected
to find new counsel and have them prepared for trial within a week.  
 
  The Motion is DENIED.
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this tentative
must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the
instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
