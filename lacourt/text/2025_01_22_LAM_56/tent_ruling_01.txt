  Case Number:  22STCV19770    Hearing Date:   January 22, 2025    Dept:  56     SUPERIOR  COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA  FOR  THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES - CENTRAL DISTRICT       LETICIA VASQUEZ,                          Plaintiff,             vs.    CENTRAL BASIN MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT, a    California Public Agency, ALEX ROJAS; and DOES 1 through 25, inclusive,                                                                                                            Defendants.                  CASE NO.:  22STCV19770   [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:  MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL   Date: January 22, 2025 Time: 8:30 a.m. Dept. 56          MOVING  PARTY:  Plaintiff Leticia Vasquez  (“Plaintiff”) RESPONDING  PARTY: Defendants Central Basin Municipal Water District and Alex Rojas  (collectively, “Defendants”)               The Court has considered the moving,  opposition and reply papers.    BACKGROUND              This action arises from alleged violations of  the Bane Civil Rights Act (the “Bane Act”). Plaintiff is an elected public  official who serves on the Governing Board of Directors of the Central Basin  Municipal Water District (the “Board”). On June 16, 2022, Plaintiff filed the  operative complaint (the “Complaint”) against Defendants Central Basin  Municipal Water District (the “District”) and Alex Rojas (“Rojas”), the  District manager. The Complaint alleges that Defendants violated the Bane Act  by preventing Plaintiff from exercising her right to freedom of speech under  the United States Constitution and the California Constitution.     On March 21, 2024, Defendants filed a  motion for summary judgment. On December 13, 2024, the motion for summary  judgment was granted in Defendants' favor.                On January 6, 2025, Plaintiff filed  the instant motion for new trial (the “Motion”). On January 8, 2025, Defendants  filed an opposition (the “Opposition”). On January 13, 2025, Plaintiff filed a  reply (the “Reply”).   REQUEST FOR  JUDICIAL NOTICE             Pursuant  to Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (d), the Court may take judicial  notice of “[r]ecords of (1) any court of this state or (2) any court of record  of the United States or of any state of the United States”.    The court,  however, may not take judicial notice of the truth of the contents of the  documents. (Herrera v. Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. (2011) 196  Cal.App.4th 1366, 1375.) Documents are only judicially noticeable to show their  existence and what orders were made such that the truth of the facts and  findings within the documents are not judicially noticeable. (Lockley v. Law  Office of Cantrell, Green, Pekich, Cruz & McCort (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th  875, 885.)                    Pursuant  to Plaintiff’s request, the Court takes judicial notice of the following: (1) Verified  Complaint filed by Plaintiff (RJN, Ex. 7); (2) Baca v. Moreno Valley Unified  School Dist., 936 F.Supp. 719, 729, 730 (C.D.Cal.1996) (RJN, Ex. 18); (3) Black  Lives Matter v. San Joaquin Cty., 398 F. Supp. 3d 660 (RJN, Ex. 19); (4) Cuviello  v. City of Vallejo, No. 16-cv-02584-2KJM-KJN, 13-14 (E.D. Cal. Nov. 16,  2020) (RJN, Ex. 20); (5) Gant v. Cnty. of L.A., 772 F.3d 608, 624 (9th  Cir. 2014) (RJN, Ex. 21); (6) Leventhal v. Vista Unified School Dist.,  973 F.Supp. 951 (1997) (RJN, Ex. 22); (7) M.H. v. County of Alameda, 90  F. Supp. 3d 889 (RJN, Ex. 23); and (8) Moreno v. Town of Los Gatos, 267  Fed.Appx. 665 (2008) 9th Cir (RJN, Ex. 24.)  For future reference, the Court notes that  neither documents filed in this case nor reported decisions are required subjects  of judicial notice.               The  Court declines to take judicial notice of Plaintiff’s remaining requests as  these items are not judicially noticeable under Evidence Code section 452.               DISCUSSION             An aggrieved party may move for new  trial may under seven grounds prescribed by Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”)  section 657. A party seeking reversal of an adverse summary judgment ruling may  also make a motion for new trial on the grounds that there are triable issues  of material fact or that there is newly discovered evidence favoring reversal  of the summary judgment ruling. (See Doe v. United Air Lines, Inc.  (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 1500, 1504-1505.)    The seven grounds are:  (1) Irregularity in the proceedings of the  court, jury or adverse party, or any order of the court or abuse of discretion  by which either party was prevented from having a fair trial.  (2) Misconduct of the jury; and whenever  any one or more of the jurors have been induced to assent to any general or  special verdict, or to a finding on any question submitted to them by the  court, by a resort to the determination of chance, such misconduct may be  proved by the affidavit of any one of the jurors.  (3) Accident or surprise, which ordinary  prudence could not have guarded against.  (4) Newly discovered evidence, material  for the party making the application, which he could not, with reasonable  diligence, have discovered and produced at the trial.  (5) Excessive or inadequate damages.  (6) Insufficiency of the evidence to  justify the verdict or other decision, or the verdict or other decision is  against law.  (7) Error in law, occurring at the trial  and excepted to by the party making the application. (CCP, § 657, subds.  (1)-(7).)    To grant a new trial, the Court must  determine that there exists in this action an insufficiency of evidence at  trial to justify the verdict because, after weighing the evidence, the Court is  convinced from the entire record, including reasonable inferences, that the  judge or jury clearly should have reached a different verdict or decision. (See  CCP, § 657; Lauren H v. Kannappan (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 834, 839; see Dominguez  v. Pantalone (1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 201, 216 [A judge may not grant a new  trial even where the judge would have found differently from the jury].) The  standard is instead one requiring the conclusion “that the verdict was  obviously and clearly wrong.” (Cal. Judges Benchbook: Civil Proceedings-After  Trial (2021 Supp.) Insufficient Evidence to Justify Verdict or Decision (CCP §  657(6)), § 2.56.) The error must have been prejudicial. The court is bound to  deny the motion “[i]f it clearly appears that the error could not have affected  the result of the trial.” (Bristow v. Ferguson (1981) 121 Cal.App.3d  823, 826.)   “[T]he [denial] of a motion for a new  trial rests so completely within the discretion of the trial court that an  appellate court will not interfere with his action unless” there is an  “‘affirmative showing of a gross, manifest or unmistakable abuse of discretion.’  [Citation.]” (Dunford v. General Water Heater Corp. (1957) 150  Cal.App.2d 260, 264.) “The only relevant limitation on this discretion is that  the trial court must state its reasons for granting the new trial, and there  must be substantial evidence in the record to support those reasons.  [Citation.]” (Lane v. Hughes Aircraft Co. (2000) 22 Cal.4th 405,  412.)                Plaintiff presents four arguments in  support of a new trial: (1) error in law as to the Bane Act violence  requirement; (2) error in law as to the statute of limitations period; (3)  irregularity in proceeding on Plaintiff’s claim for injunctive relief; and (4) lack  of consideration of  Plaintiff’s evidence  of violations of California statutes. (Mot. pp. 1-14.)    Bane  Act Violence Requirement             Plaintiff argues that the Court’s  reliance on Austin B. v. Escondido Union School District, (2007) 149  Cal.App.4th 860 for the elements of a Bane Act cause of action was improper  because the underlying case law in Austin B improperly adopts a violence  requirement into the Bane Act. (Mot. pp. 1-7:5.) Plaintiff argues that “the  Bane Act (Cal Civ Code §52.1) does not require interference by physically  violent acts or by threat of violent acts.” (Mot. p. 2:16-18.)    In ruling on the motion for summary  judgment, the Court cited the following elements of a claim for violation of  the Bane Act: “(1) the defendant interfered with or attempted to interfere with  the plaintiff’s constitutional or statutory rights by threats, intimidation, or  coercion; (2) the plaintiff reasonably believed that if she exercised her  constitutional rights the defendant would commit violence against her or her  property, or the defendant injured the plaintiff or her property to prevent her  from exercising her constitutional rights or retaliated against the plaintiff  for having exercised her constitutional rights…” (12/13/2024 Minute Order; Civil  Code, § 52.1; Austin B. v. Escondido Union School District, (2007) 149  Cal.App.4th 860, 883.)                Presumably, Plaintiff objects to the  second element which references a threat of violence. The Court notes, however,  that in ruling on the motion for summary judgment, the Court did not reach the  second element. The Court found as follows: “Thus, based on the foregoing,  Defendants have demonstrated that Plaintiff cannot establish the first element  of her Bane Act cause of action—that Defendants interfered with or attempted to  interfere with Plaintiff’s constitutional or statutory rights through threats,  intimidation, or coercion—because Defendants have presented evidence showing  that the alleged threats, intimidation or coercion are either time-barred, do  not flow from a statutory or constitutional right, or otherwise did not occur.”  (emphasis added) (12/13/2024 Minute Order, p. 5.) The Court did not determine  whether violence is a necessary element of a Bane Act cause of action, nor was  such a determination relevant to its ruling on the motion for summary judgment.  Therefore, Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any 'error of law' that would  have impacted the outcome of the motion for summary judgment.    Statute  of Limitations             Next, Plaintiff argues that the  Court erred in applying the two-year statute of limitations to Plaintiff’s  allegation that she was assaulted by Robert Apodaca. (Mot. p. 7:9-23) Plaintiff  argues that a Bane Act cause of action is subject to the three-year statute of  limitations contained in CCP section 338 subdivision (a) not the two-year  statute of limitations for assault actions in CCP section 335.1. (Mot. p.  7:21-23)               As Defendant asserts in the  Opposition, while the applicable limitations period for a liability created by  statute is three years, this limitations periods does not apply where the claim  is rooted in the common law. (Opp. pp. 5:7-7:8; Gotto v. Superior Court of  Sonoma County (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 744, 760; Stamps v. Superior Court  (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 1441.) Plaintiff alleges that in February 2020, “board  member Robert Apodaca physically assaulted and battered the plaintiff while she  was presiding over a Central Basin board meeting as president of the board”  when “Apodaca, without warning, pushed the plaintiff and attempted to grab the  gavel out of her hand.” (Compl., ¶ 34.) As the Complaint in this action was  filed in June of 2022 and actions for assault are subject to a two-year statute  of limitations (CCP § 335.1), “[t]o the extent Plaintiff’s claim is based upon  this incident, it is barred by the statute of limitations.” (12/13/2024 Minute Order.) Thus, the Court did not err  in applying the two-year statute of limitations to the alleged assault  incident.    Irregularity  in Proceedings             Irregularity in the proceedings  includes any departure by the court from the due and orderly method of disposition  of an action by which the substantial rights of a party have been materially  affected, where such departure is not evidenced by a ruling or order that may  be made the subject of an exception.  (Lowe v. Massachusetts Mut. Life  Ins. Co. (1976) 54 Cal.App.3d 718, 740.)  The question always is as to  whether the acts were of such a nature, and done under such circumstances, as  to afford reasonable grounds for the conclusion that by reason thereof the  defeated party has not had a fair and impartial trial. (Id.)                 Examples of judicial conduct that were  the basis for a new trial on the ground of irregularity in the proceedings  include: (1) showing partiality for a party (Davis v. Pezel (1933) 131  Cal.App.46, 50-52); (2) showing bias or prejudice against a party (Catchpole  v. Brannon (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 237, 262); (3) prejudging the case or  expressing an opinion on the merits before all the evidence has been presented  (Webber v. Webber (1948) 33 Cal.2d 153, 156-162); (4) improperly  commenting on evidence in front of jurors (Lewis v. Bill Robertson &  Sons (1984) 162 Cal.App.3d 650, 654-55); (5) ridiculing a party, attorney,  or witness (Kloepfer v. Commission on Judicial Performance (1989) 49  Cal.3d 826, 842); and (6) coercing the jurors into reaching a verdict. (Langdon  v. Superior Court (1923) 65 Cal.App.41, 43.)     Plaintiff offers no evidence that the  Court engaged in any such conduct showing partiality, bias or prejudgment in  favor of a party. Instead, Plaintiff argues that there was an irregularity in  the proceedings because her “claim for permanent injunction was not challenged  by the motion for summary judgment and therefore it should not have been  dismissed.” (Mot. p. 8:1-2.) She does not argue or offer any evidence that the  Court had partiality, bias, or prejudgment when it made this decision. In addition, as Defendant notes in the  Opposition, Plaintiff “never addressed the injunction in opposition to the  motion for summary judgment or at the hearing of the motion for summary  judgment” (Opp. p. 8:4-6) Plaintiff’s failure to address the injunction request  earlier constitutes a waiver of this ground for a new trial.  Furthermore, the Court finds no authority to  support the proposition that Plaintiff is entitled to a trial for injunctive  relief after the cause of action has been resolved against her on its merits. Consequently,  this statutory ground for a new trial is insufficient to support the relief  requested.   Evidence  of Violations of California Statutes              Lastly, Plaintiff argues that the  Court erroneously omitted consideration of the disputed evidence alleging  violations of Government Code sections 54954.3, 54954.2 (a)(3), California  Water Code section 71300 and Central Basin Administrative Code section 4.5(c). Specifically,  Plaintiff references her separate statement submitted in opposition to  Defendants motion for summary judgment numbers 10-11 [deactivation of email], 18-20  [obtaining documents and information of the sale of the Central Basin  Headquarters], 21-26 [consent agenda], 36-41 [reduction in pay], and 44-46  [removing Plaintiff’s residence from the Central Basin service area]. (Wilson  Decl., pp. 4-6; Supp. Wilson Decl., pp. 2-4.) The Court notes that each of  these issues was referenced in the ruling on the motion for summary judgment  and considered by the Court. (12/13/2024 Minute Order, pp. 3-4, 5.) Here, Plaintiff  merely rehashes the arguments made in her opposition to the motion for summary  judgment. Plaintiff’s responses in her separate statement consist entirely of  argument, not facts or evidence. While the Plaintiff may disagree with how the  Court evaluated the disputed ‘evidence,’ this does not mean there are triable  issues of material fact. Even drawing all inferences in Plaintiff’s favor, the above-described  events do not amount to interference with Plaintiff’s constitutional or  statutory rights through threat, intimidation or coercion. The standard to  grant a new trial, or reverse an adverse summary judgment ruling, requires the  conclusion “that the verdict was obviously and clearly wrong.” (Civil Procedure  After Trial, Section 2.56.) That is not the Court’s conclusion here.               Plaintiff’s Motion for New Trial is  DENIED.     Moving  Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.                   Parties who intend to submit on this  tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed  by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email  and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off  calendar.   Dated this 22nd day of January 2025                     Hon. Holly J.    Fujie Judge of the    Superior Court
