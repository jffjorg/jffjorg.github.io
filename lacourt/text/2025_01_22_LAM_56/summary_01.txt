And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion for new trial filed by Plaintiff Leticia Vasquez and has denied the motion. The court finds that the Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any grounds for a new trial, including errors in the court's ruling on the motion for summary judgment, irregularities in the proceedings, and omissions of evidence.

The court notes that the Plaintiff's claims are barred by the statute of limitations, and that the Plaintiff's allegations of violations of California statutes are not sufficient to demonstrate a new trial.

The court also finds that the Plaintiff's arguments regarding the alleged interference with her constitutional and statutory rights are not supported by the evidence and that the court's ruling on the motion for summary judgment was correct.

Accordingly, the court denies the Plaintiff's motion for new trial.
