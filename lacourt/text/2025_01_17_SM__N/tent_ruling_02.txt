(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1320(j).)Defendant Maria Melchior to give notice. REASONINGRequest for Judicial NoticeDefendant Maria Melchior (“Defendant”) requests judicial notice of Plaintiff Element Eclipse (“Plaintiff”)’s complaint in this action. Defendant’s request is GRANTED pursuant to Evidence code section 452, subdivision (d).Legal Standard“[A] demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.) A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (See Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a demurrer, a court may not consider declarations, matters not subject to judicial notice, or documents not accepted for the truth of their contents].) For purposes of ruling on a demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed to be true (Aubry v. Tri-City Hosp. Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967), but the Court does not “assume the truth of contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law” (Moore v. Regents of University of California (1990) 51 Cal.3d 120, 125).Leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (See Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349 [court shall not “sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if there is any reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment”]; Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redevelopment Agency (2002) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1037 [“A demurrer should not be sustained without leave to amend if the complaint, liberally construed, can state a cause of action under any theory or if there is a reasonable possibility the defect can be cured by amendment.”]; Vaccaro v. Kaiman (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 761, 768 [“When the defect which justifies striking a complaint is capable of cure, the court should allow leave to amend.”].) The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)AnalysisDefendant demurs to the complaint on the ground that it was filed after the two-year statute of limitations for personal injury actions provided by Code of Civil Procedure section 335.1. Plaintiff alleges injury on January 29, 2022 (Compl. ¶ 8), but the complaint was not filed until January 30, 2024. Plaintiff opposes the motion with argument that the clerk of court wrongfully rejected the filing of the complaint on January 25, 2024, and the complaint had been filed on January 24, 2024. Notably, this is not apparent on the face of the complaint or through reference to judicially noticeable documents; thus, a demurrer is properly made in that regard.However, California Rules of Court, rule 5.560(f) provides that “[c]lerical errors in judgments, orders, or other parts of the record may be corrected by the court at any time on the court’s own motion or on motion of any party and may be entered nunc pro tunc,” i.e., the Court may amend the filing date of the pleading on its own motion. The Court notes that the filing was not a clerical error, as required under the rule; rather, it was the result of the transmitter’s error in filing the action. Plaintiff’s counsel represents that he chose Stanley Mosk Courthouse as the proper filing courthouse, and he received an email from Nationwide Legal on January 24, 2024 that his filing had been successfully submitted. (Opp’n, Dominguez Decl. ¶¶ 3-4., Exs. B, C.) Nonetheless, on January 30, 2024, he received an email from Nationwide Legal advising him that the filing had been rejected because the complaint needed to be filed with the Santa Monica Courthouse. (Opp’n, Dominguez Decl. ¶ 6, Ex. E.) He then refiled the complaint on that date. (Opp’n, Dominguez Decl. ¶¶ 7-8.)Plaintiff argues that Code of Civil Procedure section 402, subdivisions (a)(1) to (a)(3), gives the Court the power to “specify by local rule the locations where certain types of actions or proceedings are to be filed” or “heard or tried,” but the Court “may not dismiss a case, and the clerk may not reject a case for filing, because it is filed, or a person seeks to file it, in a court location other than the location specified by local rule.” Rather, Code of Civil Procedure section 402, subdivision (a)(3), gives the Court the authority to “transfer the case on its own motions to the proper court location.” The Court ordered additional briefing on this issue, specifically whether the Court may dismiss an action in light of Code of Civil Procedure section 402.The Court finds that the clerk improperly rejected the complaint when it was filed on January 24, 2024. Code of Civil Procedure section 402, subdivision (a)(3), makes clear that the clerk may not reject a case for filing because it is filed in a court other than the location specified by local rule, and that is what happened here. Because the clerk had no proper basis for rejecting Plaintiff’s complaint, it must be deemed filed when it was presented on January 24, 2024. (Rojas v. Cutsforth (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 774, 778 [stating same].)On the Court’s own motion, the clerk shall file Plaintiff Element Eclipse’s Complaint in the within action to conform to the date said Complaint was actually presented to the Clerk for filing, on January 24, 2024. In accordance with section 7 of the Los Angeles Superior Court’s First Amended General Order re: Mandatory Electronic Filing, the Clerk shall also amend the filing endorsement on the Complaint and the Register of Actions to reflect the corrected filing date of said Complaint to January 24, 2024. Defendant Maria Melchior’s Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint is Defendant Maria Melchior’s Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint is OVERRULED. Defendant Maria Melchior shall file and serve an answer to the Plaintiff Element Eclipse’s Complaint within ten (10) days of entry of this order. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1320(j).)
