And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint is overruled. The plaintiff, Element Eclipse, alleges personal injury and is seeking relief. The defendant, Maria Melchior, demurred to the complaint, arguing that it was filed after the 2-year statute of limitations for personal injury actions. However, the judge found that the clerk improperly rejected the complaint when it was first filed on January 24, 2024, and that the complaint should be deemed filed on that date. Therefore, the judge is ordering the clerk to correct the filing date to January 24, 2024. The defendant is ordered to file and serve an answer to the complaint within 10 days of the entry of this order.
