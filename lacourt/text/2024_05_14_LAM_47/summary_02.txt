English text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court grants the plaintiff's motion to quash third-party subpoenas for business records. The court finds that the subpoenas are overly broad and seek to obtain private financial information of the plaintiff and its employees, officers, and shareholders. The court concludes that the plaintiff has a reasonable expectation of privacy in its financial affairs and that the subpoenas are a serious intrusion into the plaintiff's privacy interests. The court also finds that the defendant has not shown that the information sought is directly relevant to any of the issues in the case. The court orders that the subpoenas be quashed in their entirety, conditioned on the payment of an additional $300 in filing fees.
