And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendant, American Honda Motor Co., Inc. The demurrer was filed against the third cause of action in the plaintiff's complaint, which alleges a breach of express warranty under Civil Code section 1793.2.

The judge found that the plaintiff's allegations do not adequately support their third cause of action. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant failed to provide sufficient parts and literature to authorized repair facilities, but does not provide specific facts to support this claim. The judge ruled that the plaintiff's allegations are insufficient to state a claim for breach of express warranty and sustained the demurrer.

The judge gave the plaintiff 20 days to amend its First Amended Complaint or move forward on only the first two causes of action. The plaintiff will need to provide more specific facts to support its claim of breach of express warranty in order to proceed with the third cause of action.
