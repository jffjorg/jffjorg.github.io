And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on a motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories filed by the plaintiff, Brian Whitaker, against the defendant, K-Cork, Inc. The motion was denied with specific rulings on each of the special interrogatories. The judge found that the defendant had substantial justification for some of its objections, so monetary sanctions were not appropriate.

The judge also denied a request for sanctions in the amount of $3,660.00.

The plaintiff is seeking to compel the defendant to provide supplemental responses to special interrogatories regarding the construction date of the subject property, financial records, and facts tending to show that accessible dining surfaces were not readily achievable. The judge found that the defendant's responses were evasive and incomplete, but also found that the defendant had made a reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the requested information.

The judge's tentative ruling is that the defendant's "unknown" answer to Special Interrogatory No. 7 will stand, and the defendant will be at risk at trial of being unable to assert a defense that the plaintiff or his expert are applying the wrong architectural standards because of the date of construction. The judge also found that the defendant's responses to Requests for Production of Documents were incomplete, and that the defendant will be barred from any defense at trial that it lacks the financial resources to make changes to its dining areas and counter surfaces to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
