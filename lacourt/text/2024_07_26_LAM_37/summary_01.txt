Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendants' motion requiring the plaintiff, Akemi Minami, to post a bond of $50,000. The defendants argued that the action will not benefit Bekon Corporation or its shareholders, and that the corporation will incur expenses exceeding $200,000 in defending the action. The judge finds that the defendants failed to meet their burden of showing that the action will not be beneficial to the corporation. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's complaint alleges facts to show that she seeks recovery of assets in the form of payments made to defendants under the guise of "officer compensation" and to force defendants to adhere to Bekon's bylaws and the Corporations Code. The judge concludes that the motion is denied, and that defendants must give notice.
