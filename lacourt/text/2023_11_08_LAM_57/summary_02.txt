And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies Defendant James Shiau's motion to vacate the summary judgment order in favor of Plaintiff Mintaka Financial, LLC. Shiau argues that his attorney, Jason Koch, was so neglectful that it was as if Koch had substituted himself out of the case, leaving Shiau self-represented. However, the Judge finds that Koch's neglect did not rise to the level necessary to fall within the "positive misconduct exception" to the general rule of attorney's inexcusable neglect. The Judge concludes that Shiau's remedy lies in a malpractice action against Koch, rather than in a Section 473(b) motion to overturn the summary judgment order.
