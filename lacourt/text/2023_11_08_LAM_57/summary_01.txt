The motion seeks to dismiss the declaratory relief claim brought by David Halverson and Ryan Kelly, who allege that they did not misappropriate Seek Capital's trade secrets. The Court finds that Seek Capital does not claim that Halverson and Kelly misappropriated its trade secrets, and therefore, they are not entitled to declaratory relief. The Court will discuss the reasoning behind this ruling further at the hearing on November 8, 2023.
