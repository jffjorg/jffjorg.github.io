And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions for summary judgment and summary adjudication in the case of Roberto Corona v. Compton Unified School District, et al.

The judge denied Defendant Davidson's motion for summary adjudication on the punitive damages claim, finding that a reasonable factfinder could conclude that Defendant Davidson acted with intent to cause harm during the physical altercation with Plaintiff.

The judge granted Defendant District's motion for summary adjudication on the negligent hiring, retention, and supervision claim, finding that the District met its initial burden by demonstrating that no information during Davidson's tenure indicated he posed an unreasonable particular risk.

The judge will hear further argument on Defendant District's motion for summary judgment on the vicarious liability claim, finding that the core issue is whether Defendant Davidson acted within the scope of his employment when he attacked Plaintiff.

The judge orders that the parties submit or appear at the hearing on November 27, 2024, and that the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court if the parties do not submit or appear.
