And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment against the defendant, SFO Merchandise, Inc. The plaintiff had filed a breach of contract lawsuit against the defendant and had failed to respond or appear, resulting in default. The plaintiff then requested entry of default judgment, but the judge has denied this request without prejudice. The judge's decision is based on several issues with the evidence submitted by the plaintiff, including a lack of foundation for some of the evidence, insufficient declarations, and an inadequate interest calculation. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to submit additional evidence and declarations to support its claims and to provide a proper interest calculation before it can request entry of default judgment again.
