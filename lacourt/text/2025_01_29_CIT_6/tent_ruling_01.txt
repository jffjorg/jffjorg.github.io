  Case Number:  24PSCV02951    Hearing Date:   January 29, 2025    Dept:  6 Plaintiff
’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment 
Defendant: SFO Merchandise, Inc. 
TENTATIVE RULING 
            Plaintiff’s
request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.           
BACKGROUND           
            This
is a breach of contract case. On September 9, 2024, plaintiff United Supply
Chain Services Inc. (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendant SFO
Merchandise Inc. (Defendant) and Does 1 to 10, alleging causes of action for
breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and conversion. 
            On
October 29, 2024, default was entered against Defendant. 
            On
December 20, 2024, Plaintiff requested entry of default judgment.           
LEGAL
STANDARD 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party
has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party
seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court
Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other
admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest
computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration
of nonmilitary status; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all
parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate
judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for
attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.) 
ANALYSIS 
Plaintiff seeks default judgment against
Defendant in the total amount of $1,515,743.87, including $1,511,347.00 in
damages, $3,778.36 in interest, and $618.51 in costs. The Court notes a few
issues with Plaintiff’s default judgment request. First, some of the evidence
submitted lacks foundation, such as the contract. (Cullinane Decl., Ex. A.) The
declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel is insufficient because it lacks personal
knowledge regarding the contract and many of the details that led to this
lawsuit. (Kim v. Westmoore Partners, Inc.
(2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, 288 [declarations submitted in support of default
judgment found to be “useless as evidence” where they were unintelligible and
lacked foundation].) Plaintiff needs to submit declarations and evidence from
someone having personal knowledge to establish an adequate foundation to
support the amount of damages requested. (See Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361 [plaintiff must still
introduce admissible prima facie evidence of damages].) 
Second, the other
documentary evidence Plaintiff submitted shows damages amounting to only $1,251,347.00.
(Cullinane Decl., Ex. B.) Plaintiff will need to submit additional evidence to
support the full $1,511,347.00 requested, as Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration
is insufficient for the reasons set forth above. (See Cullinane Decl., ¶¶ 12-14.) 
Third, Plaintiff
did not provide a prejudgment interest calculation. (See Cullinane Decl., ¶ 20;
Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800, subd. (a)(3).) 
CONCLUSION           
            Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s request
for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
