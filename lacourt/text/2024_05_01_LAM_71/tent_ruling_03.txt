  SOLUTIONS GROUP, et al. 


 Case No.:  20STCV09522 
 
 
 
 Hearing
  Date:  May 1, 2024



 
Plaintiff Angel Lujan’s motion to enforce
the Settlement Agreement, executed September 20, 2023, with Defendants PSG
California LLC, David Leedom, and Beth Seara is denied.  
 
Plaintiff Angel Lujan (“Lujan”) (“Plaintiff”) moves for an order
enforcing the settlement agreement between Plaintiff and Defendants PSG
California LLC (“PSG”), David Leedom (“Leedom”), and Beth Seara (“Seara”) (collectively,
“Defendants”) that was entered into on September 20, 2023.  (Notice of Motion Settlement, pg. 2; C.C.P.
§664.6.)  Plaintiff moves on the grounds that
Defendants have breached the settlement agreement by failing to perform under
the terms of the settlement in the following respects: by the withholding of a
portion of the settlement and non-payment of $21,243.54 due per the terms of
the Settlement Agreement no later than Friday, October 20, 2023.  (Notice of Motion Settlement, pg. 2.)
 
Request for Judicial Notice
Plaintiff’s 2/2/24 request for judicial
notice of (1) the Court docket in this matter is denied, as the Court does not
need to take judicial notice of filings on the instant docket.
Plaintiff’s 2/2/24 request for judicial
notice of (1) the October 11, 2022, notice of motion and motion for order
restraining judgment debtor David R. Denis in BC704715 Mintz v. Law Offices of David R. Denis
P.C. (P-RJN,
Exh. 2); and (2) the May 17, 2023, Order in BC704715 Mintz v. Law Offices of David R. Denis
P.C. (P-RJN,
Exh. 3), is granted.
 
Background
          On or about
September 15, 2023, Plaintiff entered into a settlement agreement in the case
of Lujan v. PSG California, LLC, et al. (“Lujan Settlement”) whereby
Defendant promised to pay Plaintiff’s counsel, the Law Offices of David R.
Denis, P.C. (“LODD”), an agreed upon sum of attorneys’ fees.
          On or about October
17, 2023, Eric Mintz (“Mintz”) informed Defendant by letter of a judgment
obtained against LODD in the case of Mintz v. Denis, et al. LASC Case
No. BC704715, amounting to $16,935.90 with interest running per statute, which
Defendant estimates to currently amount to $21,243.54.  In addition, Mintz has obtained an assignment
and restraining order from the Court ordering all attorneys’ fees payable to
LODD to be paid in satisfaction of such judgment. LODD alleges it has satisfied
the above-mentioned judgment which Mintz denies.
On or about October 26, 2023, Defendant requested that LODD
produce an order from the Court confirming that said judgment had been
satisfied. However, no such order has been produced. 
 
On or about October 29, 2023, Mintz informed Defendant of a
third-party claim of ownership filed by Euro Spec Motoring, Inc. (“Euro Spec”)
in the Mintz action, claiming a right of possession to $21,243.54 of
LODD’s.
On November 8, 2023, Defendant filed a complaint in interpleader
against Mintz, Euro Spec, and LODD, which is currently pending in the Los
Angeles County Superior Court’s limited jurisdiction department, Case No.
23STLC07184.
Plaintiff filed the instant motion on February 2, 2024.  Defendants filed their opposition on February
14, 2024.  Plaintiff filed his reply on
February 21, 2024.
 
Discussion
C.C.P. §664.6 provides, as
follows: “If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by
the parties outside the presence of the court or orally before the court, for
settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter
judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties,
the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement
until performance in full of the terms of the settlement.”
There exists an interpleader
action that involves the money implicated in the instant motion; the
interpleader action is the appropriate venue for the issues raised in the
instant motion to be adjudicated.  (See
C.C.P. §386.)
Based on the foregoing,
Plaintiff’s motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement is denied.
 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing,
Plaintiff’s motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement is denied.  
Moving Party to give notice.
