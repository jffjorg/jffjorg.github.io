And here is the English summary:

This tentative ruling addresses the motion for an order on the scope of the appellate stay in light of the appeal of the Anti-SLAPP motion. The Court granted the motion to the extent that Cross-Complainants are permitted to propound written discovery and depositions, subject to appropriate objections, that do not implicate the "litigation-related communications and actions" embraced in the appeal of the Anti-SLAPP motion. The Court held that the appellate stay is limited in that it does not stay proceedings related to causes of action not affected by the Anti-SLAPP motion. The Court applied the Varian factors to determine that the stay should be limited. The Court also noted that the claim-by-claim analysis for an anti-SLAPP motion applies even when the defendant moves to strike an entire enumerated cause of action.
