CHRISTOPHER HARDY,  
  
         vs.
 
KEYES EUROPEAN LLC, et al.


 Case No.: 
  19STCV41202 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  May 1, 2024



 
Plaintiff Christopher Hardy’s unopposed
motion for attorneys’ fees is granted
in the amount of $33,840.50.

 
Plaintiff
Christopher Hardy (“Hardy”) (“Plaintiff”) moves unopposed for an order
awarding him $33,840.50 in attorneys’ fees against Defendant Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (“Mercedes-Benz”)
(“Defendant”).  (Notice of
Motion, pg. 1; Civ. Code §§1794(d), 1780(e).)  
 
Background
This is a lemon law action brought under the Song-Beverly
Consumer Warranty Act (“Song-Beverly Act”). 
Plaintiff accepted Defendant’s C.C.P. §998 offer of compromise (“998
Offer”) on May 4, 2023, in the amount of $20,000.00
plus attorney’s fees, costs, and expenses by motion.  (P-COE, Exh. 1.)  
On August 24, 2023, Plaintiff filed this motion for
attorneys’ fees.  As of the date of this
hearing no opposition has been filed.
 
Discussion
Civil
Code §1794(d) provides that a buyer who prevails in an action under that
section, “shall be allowed by the court to recover as a part of the judgment a
sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including attorney’s
fees based on actual time expended, determined by the court to have been
reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and the
prosecution of such action.” 
C.C.P.
§998(c)(1) provides as follows: “If an offer made by a defendant is not
accepted and the plaintiff fails to obtain a more favorable judgment or award, the plaintiff shall not
recover his or her post offer costs
and shall pay the defendant’s costs from
the time of the offer.”  (C.C.P. §998(c)(1).)  “In determining whether the plaintiff obtains a more favorable judgment,
the court . . . shall exclude the post offer costs.”  (C.C.P. §998(c)(2)(A).)  “If an offer made by a defendant is not
accepted and the plaintiff fails to obtain a more favorable judgment or award,
the costs under this section, from the time of the offer, shall be deducted
from any damages awarded in favor of the plaintiff.”  (C.C.P. §998(e).)
Section
998’s plain language only penalizes plaintiffs who “fail[] to obtain a more
favorable judgment or award” than a §998 offer by cutting off their post-offer
costs and requiring them to pay “defendant’s [post-offer] costs” out of any
“damages awarded.”  (C.C.P. §§998(c)(1),
(e).) 
A
party who settles cannot “fail” to obtain a more favorable “judgment or award.”
“Fail[ure]” connotes defeat, abandonment, or “[i]nvoluntarily” falling short of
one’s purpose.  (Madrigal v. Hyundai
Motor America (2023) 90 Cal.App.5th 385, 413-414, citing Burton’s Legal
Thesaurus (3d ed. 1998) p. 228, col. 1, Black’s Law Dict. (rev. 4th ed. 1968)
at pg. 711, col. 1; accord Cambridge Dict. Online (2023) [“fail” means
“to not succeed in what you are trying to achieve”].)  Section 998(d) is explicit: A “judgment or
award entered pursuant to this section shall be deemed to be a compromise
settlement.”  (C.C.P. §998(d).) 
Here,
Plaintiff is the prevailing party and is entitled to attorneys’ fees and costs
pursuant to the 998 Offer.
 
Civil
Code §1794(d)
Civil
Code §1794(d) provides, “[i]f the buyer prevails in an action under this
section, the buyer shall be allowed by the court to recover as part of the
judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including
attorney’s fees based on actual time expended, determined by the court to have
been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and
prosecution of such action.”
 
Reasonable Fees
To calculate a lodestar amount, the Court must
first determine the reasonableness of the hourly rates sought by the
Plaintiff’s counsel. The Supreme Court of California has concluded that a
reasonable hourly lodestar rate is the prevailing rate for private attorneys
“conducting non-contingent litigation of the same type.”  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1133, emphasis added.)
Plaintiff’s Counsel declares the following hourly
rates: (1) Christopher P. Barry at $670 per hour; (2) Gregory T. Babbitt at
$585 per hour; (3) Michell A. Cook at $335 per hour; (4) David L. Herman at
$490 per hour; (5) Jason A. Stones at $310 per hour; (6) Serena Aisenman at
$265 per hour; and (7) Leslie Mason at $150 per hour.  (Decl. of Barry ¶8; Decl. of Babbitt ¶8.)  Plaintiff has sufficiently demonstrated his
counsel’s hourly rate is reasonable in their community of practice in their
specialized area of law.  (Decl. of Barry
¶¶8-18.)
The Court finds Plaintiff’s counsel’s rate to be
reasonable and does not warrant a reduction.
 
Billed Hours
The party seeking fees and costs bears the burden
to show “the fees incurred were allowable, were reasonably necessary to the
conduct of the litigation, and were reasonable in amount.”  (Nightingale v. Hyundai Motor America (1994)
31 Cal.App.4th 99, 104.) 
In this case, the declarations and billing records
provided by Plaintiff’s counsel are sufficient to meet the burden of proving
the reasonableness of the claimed fees in terms of amounts and tasks. To
satisfy this burden, evidence and descriptions of billable tasks must be
presented in sufficient detail, enabling the court to evaluate whether the case
was overstaffed, the time attorneys spent on specific claims, and the
reasonableness of the hours expended.  (Lunada
Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 486-487.)
Plaintiff’s fee recovery is based on 83.5 hours
Plaintiff’s counsel spent litigating this case. 
(Decl. of Barry ¶8; P-COE, Exh. 5.) 
The fees incurred are reasonable, as captured in the billing records
submitted to this Court.  (P-COE, Exh. 5.)  Plaintiff’s counsel’s billing records reflect
the actual time and clear descriptions of services performed in connection with
litigating this case.  Although the
submission of such detailed time records is not necessary under California law,
if submitted, such records “are entitled to credence in the absence of a clear
indication the records are erroneous.”  (Horsford
v. Board of Trustees of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th
359, 396.)
 
Conclusion
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s unopposed motion for attorneys’ fees
is granted in the total amount of $33,840.50.
