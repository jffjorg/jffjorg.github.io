And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to enforce the settlement agreement between the parties. The settlement agreement was executed on September 20, 2023, and required the defendant to pay $21,243.54 to the plaintiff's counsel by October 20, 2023. The defendant failed to make the payment, and the plaintiff brought a motion to enforce the settlement agreement. The judge has decided that the interpleader action currently pending in the Los Angeles County Superior Court is the appropriate venue for the issues raised in the motion to enforce the settlement agreement, and therefore has denied the motion.
