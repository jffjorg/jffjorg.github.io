Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the judgment creditor's applications for orders for appearance and examination for two third persons, Miriana Benson and Robert Dapper. The judgment creditor claims that these third persons have control of property in which the judgment debtor has an interest or is indebted to the judgment creditor in an amount exceeding $250.

The judge notes that the judgment creditor has made a satisfactory showing that the third persons have control of property in which the judgment debtor has an interest or is indebted to the judgment creditor. The judge orders that the judgment creditor ensure that the requirements set out in Code of Civil Procedure, section 708.120, subdivision (f) are followed at the time the order is served on the third persons.

The judge also orders that the judgment creditor file proof of service as to each of the third persons no less than 72 hours in advance of the next hearing. The judge's decision is based on the applicable law, which states that a court shall make an order directing a third person to appear before the court to answer concerning property or debt if the judgment creditor makes an ex parte application and provides proof that the third person has possession or control of property in which the judgment debtor has an interest or is indebted to the judgment creditor.
