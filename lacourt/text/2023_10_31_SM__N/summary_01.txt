significant_statements:
  - "The trial court has broad discretion in selecting discovery sanctions, subject to reversal only for abuse."
  - "Two facts are absolutely prerequisite to imposition of the sanction: (1) there must be a failure to comply and (2) the failure must be willful."
  - "A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants in part the plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions against the defendant. The defendant is ordered to strike their answer to the first amended complaint and enter default. The judge finds that the defendant has willfully disregarded several court orders, including an order to provide further discovery responses and an order to appear for deposition and produce responsive documents. The judge concludes that the defendant has not intended to participate in the action and that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules. The judge denies the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions, finding that the defendant did not respond to the motions and that the court has imposed a sufficient sanction by entering default.
