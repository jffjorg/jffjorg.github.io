  Case Number:  21SMCV00142    Hearing Date:   October 31, 2023    Dept:  N TENTATIVE RULINGPlaintiff Benjamin Avi Harris’ Motion for an Order Imposing Terminating Sanctions by Striking Defendant Arash Jahromi’s Answer to the First Amended Complaint and Awarding Monetary Sanctions in the Amount of $23,224.00 Pursuant to CCP § 2023.030 is GRANTED in part. Defendant Arash Jahromi’s answer to Plaintiff Benjamin Avi Harris’ First Amended Complaint is hereby STRICKEN, and Defendant’s default is entered. Insofar as Plaintiff also seeks monetary sanctions, the request is DENIED.Plaintiff Benjamin Avi Harris to give notice. REASONINGPlaintiff Benjamin Avi Harris (“Plaintiff”) moves the Court for terminating sanctions again Defendant Arash Jahromi (“Defendant”) based on Defendant’s failure to comply with his discovery obligations by failing to provide further discovery responses after a court order to do so and failure to appear for his deposition or produce documents in violation of a court order. Defendant has not filed an opposition to Plaintiff’s motion for terminating sanctions, and a party’s failure to file an opposition can be considered a concession that the motion is meritorious. (See Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)If a party engages in the misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose sanctions including terminating, evidence, and monetary sanctions. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d).) Disobeying a court order to provide discovery is a misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (g).) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery also constitutes a misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)“The trial court has broad discretion in selecting discovery sanctions, subject to reversal only for abuse.” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992 (Doppes).) “[T]wo facts are absolutely prerequisite to imposition of the sanction: (1) there must be a failure to comply and (2) the failure must be willful.” (Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. LcL Adm’rs, Inc. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 1093, 1102, ellipsis omitted.) “A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Doppes, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at p. 992.)The Court lacks a basis to conclude that Defendant intends to participate in this action, as he has willfully disregarded several orders from the Court, specifically the October 6, 2022, order to provide further discovery responses to four sets of written discovery and the the August 8, 2023, order to appear for deposition and produce responsive documents. The California discovery statutes provide “an incremental approach to discovery sanctions” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992), and the Court has allowed Defendant sufficient opportunity to comply with his litigation obligations, but he has failed to do so. Thus, the Court is not convinced that any less severe sanctions would produce compliance with the discovery rules.Accordingly, Plaintiff Benjamin Avi Harris’ Motion for an Order Imposing Terminating Sanctions by Striking Defendant Arash Jahromi’s Answer to the First Amended Complaint and Awarding Monetary Sanctions in the Amount of $23,224.00 Pursuant to CCP § 2023.030 is GRANTED in part. Defendant Arash Jahromi’s answer to Plaintiff Benjamin Avi Harris’ First Amended Complaint is hereby STRICKEN, and Defendant’s default is entered. Insofar as Plaintiff also seeks monetary sanctions, the request is DENIED, as Plaintiff seeks monetary sanctions where Defendant did not respond to the motions, making sanctions unwarranted under the applicable statutes, and the Court has imposed a sufficient sanction by entering Defendant’s default.
