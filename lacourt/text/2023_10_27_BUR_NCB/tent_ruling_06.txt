BACKGROUND 
A.   
Allegations
Plaintiffs Jesus Siordia, Irene Fombona,
James Siordia, Deisi Martinez, Fernando Avilez, Angela Savanna Gonzalez (a
minor, by and through her guardian ad litem Deisi Martinez) (collectively,
“Plaintiffs”) allege that on May 27, 2021, an explosion occurred at a facility
operated by National Technical Systems, Inc. (“NTS”), which is located in
Fullerton.  They allege that the
explosion caused the death of NTS employee Jesse Siordia (“Decedent”).  They allege Decedent was the son of Jesus
Siordia and Irene Fombona; the brother of James Siordia and Deisi Martinez; and
the uncle to Angela Savanna Gonzalez and Fernando Avilez.  Plaintiffs allege they are entitled to
wrongful death damages and right of survivorship damages. 
Plaintiffs allege that the location was owned
by Defendants ERSLAND Training Center Corporation (“ERSLAND”) and ETCR, Inc.

chamber, and passively monitored the test for radio emissions.  Defendants GXAerospace, Inc., Parker Hannifin
Corporation, Motion & Flow Control Products, Inc., and Norton Sales, Inc.
were all manufacturers and/or distributors of various component parts that
comprised the MAFFS part.  Defendant
Mario Nino is alleged to be the contractor for UAC employed by Defendant Triad
Systems International who was present at the explosion and in charge of setting
up the testing.

E.    
Motion on Calendar 
On October 2, 2023, Plaintiff Westchester
Surplus Lines Insurance Company filed a motion to consolidate Case No.
23BBCV01790 with Case No. 22STCV31797.  
The Court is not in receipt of an
opposition brief. 
LEGAL
STANDARD
            CCP § 1048(a) states: “When actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending before
the court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in
issue in the actions; it may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such orders
concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.”  
DISCUSSION 
Westchester moves to consolidate Case No.
23BBCV01790 (Westchester Surplus Lines Insurance Company v. UAC, et al.)
and Case No. 22STCV31797 (Siordia et al. v. UAC, et al., this
action).  Westchester argues that the
actions arise from the same transaction or incident, involve the same parties
who are represented by the same counsel, and share common questions of fact and
law.  
Both actions arise from the subject
incident that involved the explosion. 
Consolidating the actions would promote judicial economy and convenience
with respect to law and motion practice, discovery, and depositions, promote
the convenience of witnesses, and help avoid redundant motions and unnecessary
costs.  Consolidation would also avoid
the risk of inconsistent rulings of law and findings of fact.  
The Court also notes that in its October
6, 2023 written order regarding NTS’s motion for intervention, the Court ordered
the parties to discuss whether Westchester intended to intervene in the lead
case or whether it would be added as a defendant (or involuntary plaintiff) to
NTS’s complaint in intervention. 
Consolidating the actions would help prevent the splitting of a cause of
action.  (Allstate
Ins. Co. v. Mel Rapton, Inc. (2000) 77
Cal.App.4th 901, 909 [“To avoid a violation of the rule against splitting a cause
of action, the insured and insurer “should join in a single suit against the
tortfeasor.”].)  
Finally, the motion is not opposed such
that no objections have been made by any of the other parties regarding
consolidation. 
The Court grants the motion to
consolidate.  
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
Plaintiff Westchester Surplus Lines
Insurance Company’s motion to consolidate Case No. 23BBCV01790 with Case No.
22STCV31797 is granted.  Case No. 22STCV31797
is designated as the lead case and all future papers are to be filed under that
case number.  
The Status Conference scheduled on
November 9, 2023 at 9:30 a.m. in Case No. 23BBCV01790 shall be vacated, but the
Status Conference shall remain on calendar for Case No. 22STCV31797 (the lead
case).  Westchester shall provide notice
of this order.

is dependent on numerous inconstant and fluctuating factors that may impact
whether you, or other counsel or the Court itself can be heard in a particular

example, at times, the system traps participants in electronic purgatories
where they cannot be heard and where the courtroom staff is not aware of their
presence. If you call the courtroom, please be respectful of the fact that a
court hearing is going on, and that the courtroom staff is doing their best to
use an imperfect system. If it is truly important to you to be heard, please
