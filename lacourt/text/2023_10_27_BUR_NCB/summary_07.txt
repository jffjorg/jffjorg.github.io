And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Defense Counsel Matthew B. Learned on behalf of Defendant Pacifica Foundation, Inc. The motion was filed on September 12, 2023, and Defense Counsel has filed the requisite MC-051 and MC-052 forms, but not an MC-053 proposed order form. The judge finds that there is sufficient time for Defendant to obtain substitute counsel before the Final Status Conference on April 4, 2024, and the Trial on April 15, 2024. The judge orders Defense Counsel to electronically lodge a properly filled out MC-053 proposed order form, and the order will become effective upon the filing of proof of service of a signed copy of the order on Defendant. Additionally, the judge sets an Order to Show Cause re Status of Representation of Defendant Pacifica Foundation, Inc. for December 6, 2023, to ensure that the Defendant is properly represented in the case.
