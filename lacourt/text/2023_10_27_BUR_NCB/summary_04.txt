And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the tentative ruling and has sustained the demurrer to the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 5th causes of action without leave to amend. The court finds that the plaintiffs have not alleged sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action against the defendants. The court further finds that the plaintiffs have failed to cure the issues raised in the prior demurrer order and have not presented any case law showing how a failure to produce documents would eviscerate the law regarding the formation of a contract and the basic elements thereto.

The court has also taken off-calendar the motion to strike the Prayer for Damages with respect to the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 5th causes of action, as it is now moot.

The court orders that the defendants shall provide notice of their respective order.
