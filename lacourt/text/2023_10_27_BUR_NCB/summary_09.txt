And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted the Estate's motion for leave to file a first amended complaint in the case of Max Barchichat (deceased) v. Smart & Final Stores LLC, et al. The Estate seeks to add causes of action for wrongful death, survival action, breach of contract, NIED, and IIED, and to include the Estate and Decedent's heirs as plaintiffs. The motion is granted because the Court finds that the amendments are necessary and proper, and that the proposed amendments do not unduly prejudice the Defendant. The Court also notes that the motion is not opposed and that the liberal policy in allowing amendment is strong. The Estate is ordered to file the amended complaint electronically with the Court by a specified date.
