And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Beacon Management, Inc.'s motion to set aside the default entered against it. The default was entered due to Beacon's failure to respond to the complaint in a timely manner, which was caused by a mistake and/or reliance on its broker to timely inform Beacon's insurer regarding service of the complaint. The judge has imposed a penalty of $1,000 on Beacon for its neglect and delay in the action.

The judge has also granted Beacon's motion to strike portions of the complaint, but has continued the hearing on the motion to strike to December 1, 2023, to allow Plaintiff to file an opposition brief.

The judge has directed Beacon to pay $1,000 to Plaintiff within 20 days of the order, as a penalty for its neglect and delay in the action. The judge has also continued the hearing on the motion to strike to December 1, 2023, to allow Plaintiff to file an opposition brief.
