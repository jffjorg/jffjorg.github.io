LEGAL
STANDARD
CCP §
1161.2(a)(2) states that parties in a limited action may stipulate to the
sealing of court records.  
California
Rules of Court, Rule 2.551(h) states: 
(h)
Motion, application, or petition to unseal records
(1) A sealed record must not be unsealed except on order of the court.
(2) A party or member of the public may move, apply, or petition, or the
court on its own motion may move, to unseal a record. Notice of any motion,
application, or petition to unseal must be filed and served on all parties in
the case. The motion, application, or petition and any opposition, reply, and
supporting documents must be filed in a public redacted version and a sealed
complete version if necessary to comply with (c).
(3) If the court proposes to order a record unsealed on its own motion, the
court must give notice to the parties stating the reason for unsealing the
record. Unless otherwise ordered by the court, any party may serve and file an
opposition within 10 days after the notice is provided and any other party may
file a response within 5 days after the filing of an opposition.
(4) In determining whether to unseal a record, the court must consider the
matters addressed in rule 2.550(c)-(e).
(5) The order unsealing a record must state whether the record is unsealed
entirely or in part. If the court's order unseals only part of the record or
unseals the record only as to certain persons, the order must specify the
particular records that are unsealed, the particular persons who may have
access to the record, or both. If, in addition to the records in the envelope,
container, or secure electronic file, the court has previously ordered the
sealing order, the register of actions, or any other court records relating to
the case to be sealed, the unsealing order must state whether these additional
records are unsealed.
(CRC Rule
2.551(h).)  
            CRC Rule 2.550(c) to (e) states:
(c)
Court records presumed to be open
Unless confidentiality is required by law, court records are presumed to be open.
(d) Express factual findings required to seal records
The court may order that a record be filed under seal only if it expressly
finds facts that establish:
(1) There exists an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public
access to the record;
(2) The overriding interest supports sealing the record;
(3) A substantial probability exists that the overriding interest will be
prejudiced if the record is not sealed;
(4) The proposed sealing is narrowly tailored; and
(5) No less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest.
(e)
Content and scope of the order
(1) An order sealing the record must:
(A) Specifically state the facts that support the findings; and
(B) Direct the sealing of only those documents and pages, or, if reasonably
practicable, portions of those documents and pages, that contain the material
that needs to be placed under seal. All other portions of each document or page
must be included in the public file.
(2) Consistent with Code of Civil Procedure sections 639 and 645.1, if the
records that a party is requesting be placed under seal are voluminous, the
court may appoint a referee and fix and allocate the referee's fees among the
parties.
(CRC Rule
2.550(c)-(e).)  
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff moves for an order
unsealing the court records in this action. 
Plaintiff argues that this case started as an unlawful detainer action,
but then proceeded as an ordinary civil action for damages once Defendant gave
up possession of the property.  Plaintiff
argues that because the action was converted to an ordinary civil case, the
presumption of openness of court records should apply and the records
unsealed.  
            The Court notes that on February 4,
2021, this action was reclassified as a limited civil unlawful detainer case to
a case of general jurisdiction. 
According to the Court’s electronic records, the case is deemed confidential.  
            CRC Rule 2.550(c) provides the presumption
that court records are presumed to be open unless confidentiality is required
by law.  Here, this action was an
ordinary limited, unlawful detainer case and then was converted into a general
civil action.  There are no discernable
reasons why the case (other than initially being limited) was subject to
sealing and confidentiality.  The Court
is familiar with this case and notes there are no overriding interest that
overcomes the right of public access to the record, there are no overriding
interests that support sealing the record, there would be no prejudice if the
records were unsealed, the current confidential nature of the records is not
narrowly tailored as it covers the entirety of the records, and no restrictive
measures were used at the time of sealing. 
In addition, there is no opposition to the motion.  
            At the initial hearing on the matter
on September 29, 2023, the Court ordered the parties to submit a written
payment plan showing Defendant’s proposed monthly payment to satisfy the
judgment.  The Court is not in receipt of
a written payment plan from the parties. 
The parties are ordered to attend the hearing so that the Court may
inquire if a plan is forthcoming. 
            However, in light of the lack of
filing of the payment plan, the Court is inclined to grant the motion to
unseal.  The unsealing of the records
shall be as to the entirety of the court’s records in this action.  
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
            The Court is
inclined to grant Plaintiff’s motion to unseal the entirety of the court
records.  The Court orders the parties to
attend the hearing so that it may inquire whether the parties have agreed to a
payment plan for Defendant.  If the
parties fail to appear or a payment plan has not been agreed upon, the motion
will be granted. 
            Plaintiff shall provide notice of
this order.
