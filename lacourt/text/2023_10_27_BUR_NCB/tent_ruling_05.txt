  order RE:
Application of keith scully to appear as counsel pro hac vice



 
            On
October 2, 2023, Counsel Keith Scully (“Counsel”) filed an application to
appear as counsel pro hac vice for Plaintiff
Michael L. Zinna.  
Under CRC Rule 9.40, attorneys licensed and in
good standing in other states may, upon the California court’s approval, appear
as counsel pro hac vice in a pending
case if an active member of the state bar is associated as attorney of
record.  (CRC Rule 9.40(a).)  Counsel is a member, in good standing, of the State Bar
of Washington.  (Counsel
Decl., ¶2.)  In addition, Counsel is not a resident of the State of California, is
not regularly employed in the State of California, and is not engaged in
substantial business, professional or other activities in the State of
California.  (Id., ¶1.)  Thus, Counsel
satisfies the eligibility
requirements of CRC Rule 9.40(a). 
Counsel’s declaration addresses the six content
requirements outlined in CRC Rule 9.40(d). 
Counsel provides: (1) his residence and office address (Counsel
Decl., ¶1); (2) the
courts to which he has been admitted to practice and the dates of admission (id., ¶2); (3) that he is a member in
good standing in those courts (id., ¶2);
(4) that he is not currently suspended or disbarred in any court (id., ¶3); (5) that he has filed one application
in the past two years to appear as counsel pro
hac vice in the state of California, which was granted on April 19, 2022 in
Zeta Global Corp. v. Socialcom Inc. (case no. 19SMCV01066) (id., ¶4); and (6) the name, address, and
telephone number of the active member of the State Bar of California who is
attorney of record (id., ¶5).  
Furthermore, Counsel has met the requirement of CRC 9.40(c)(1) which
states that “a person desiring to appear as counsel pro hac vice in a superior court must file with the court a
verified application together with proof of service . . . of a copy of the
application and of the notice on all parties who have appeared in the cause and
on the State Bar of California at its San Francisco office.”  Counsel states that a copy of the motion was
mailed to the State Bar of California, along with a check for $50.  (CRC Rule 9.40(e); Counsel Decl., ¶7; see
Proof of Service filed October 2, 2023 on State Bar of California).)  
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
Based on the foregoing, the application
for pro hac vice admission of Counsel
Ketih Scully is granted. According to the application, Counsel’s Washington
State Bar number is 28677, his office address is 1201 Second Avenue, Suite 900,
Seattle, WA 98101, and his phone number is (206) 274-2800.  
Counsel is also advised that he must pay a
$500 annual renewal fee one year from the date this motion is granted.  The Court sets a Non-Appearance Case Review
re: Payment of Annual Renewal of Pro Hac Vice Fees of $500 by Counsel Keith
Scully for October 28, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. 
Counsel shall give notice of this order.
