BACKGROUND
A.   
Allegations 
Plaintiff Angie Ross (“Plaintiff”) commenced this action against
Defendants BMW of North America, LLC (“BMWNA”) and Valencia B Imports, Inc.,
d/b/a Valencia BMW (“VBMW”) for violating the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty
Act (“Act”).  Plaintiff alleges that she
purchased a 2016 BMW i3 REX vehicle (VIN WBY1Z4C56GV506016) from Century West

had defects, including, but not limited to: “the vehicle’s battery dying frequently
and abnormally, the vehicle driver restraint system malfunctioning, the vehicle
being unable to start, the vehicle’s drivetrain malfunction light illuminating
frequently and abnormally, and the vehicle’s battery warning light illuminating
frequently and abnormally.”  (Compl.,

Plaintiff alleges that no less than 4 times, she delivered the vehicle
for repair to BMWNA and/or VBMW, but the vehicle was returned without proper
repairs.  
The complaint, filed February 23, 2021, alleges causes of action for: (1)
breach of express warranty under the Act against BMWNA; (2) breach of implied

Motion on Calendar 
On September 26, 2023, Defendant BMWNA filed a motion to strike or tax
costs.  
On October 16, 2023, Plaintiff filed an opposition brief.
On October 20, 2023, BMWNA filed a reply brief. 
DISCUSSION 
A.    Item 1: Filing and Motion Fees 
CCP §1033.5(a)(1) classifies filing, motion, and jury fees as allowable
costs under section 1032.  
BMWNA moves to strike $1,390.01 in filing fees, arguing that Plaintiff
is not entitled to recovery filing fees other than the initial filing fee. 
However, section 1033.5(a)(1) allows the recovery of “[f]iling, motion,
and jury fees.”  Thus, Plaintiff may
recover costs for filing motions/oppositions and ex parte applications, as well
as for costs related to filing document with the court.
The motion to strike/tax costs in Item 1 is denied.   
B.     Item 2: Jury Fees; Item 5: Service of Process; and Item No. 12: Models,
Enlargements, and Photocopies of Exhibits 
BMWNA did not object to Items 2, 5, and 12.    
C.     Item 4: Deposition Costs   
CCP § 1033.5(a)(3) states that: (A)
taking, video recording, and transcribing necessary depositions, including an
original and one copy of those taken by the claimant and one copy of
depositions taken by the party against whom costs are allowed; (B) fees of a
certified or registered interpreter for the deposition of a party or witness
who does not proficiently speak or understand the English language; and (C)
travel expenses to attend depositions, are allowable costs under section 1032.  
BMWNA moves to strike $4,814.50 in
deposition costs, arguing that the costs must be reasonable to be recoverable.
Specifically, BMWNA argues that Plaintiff’s claimed costs of $1,856.50 for the
depositions of Eric Zahn, Steven Gallagher, and Steven Koberna are combined
without explanation and that Mr. Gallagher and Mr. Koberna were not called to testify
at trial and their deposition transcripts were not used in any way.  It also argues that Plaintiff’s costs of $1,505
for the depositions of Jasmine Garcia and Robert Rowlands, and the $1,453
incurred for Ivan Hernandez should not be recoverable because they were not
called as witnesses and their deposition transcripts were not used in the
action.  
While certain witnesses’ deposition
transcripts were not ultimately used in the action, this does not necessarily
mean that costs with respect to their deposition are unrecoverable.  BMWNA has not provided any authority showing
that a failure to call a deposed witness at trial or failure to use the
deposition transcript is a ground to tax deposition costs.  As pointed out by Plaintiff in opposition, it
may be necessary to take the deposition of a particular witness to ascertain
whether or not that witness will be excluded or included in the witness list at
trial.  (Opp. at p. 3.)   
The Court declines to reduce these
costs.  The motion to tax Item 4 is
denied. 
D.    Item 5: Service of Process 
“Service of process by a public
officer, registered process server, or other means” is an allowable cost under
CCP § 1033.5(a)(4).
BMWNA moves to strike $2,975.12 in
service of process costs.  BMWNA argues
that Plaintiff’s claimed cost of $1,002 for serving a trial subpoena on Mr.
Gallagher, Mr. Koberna, Mr. Rowlands, and Ms. Garcia; $460.11 for serving trial
subpoenas on Ivan de Jesus Valdez and Alen Yadger; and $424.50 for serving
trial subpoenas on the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power should be stricken
because these non-parties were not called to trial or even requested.  It also argues that Plaintiff’s claimed cost
of $490.95 for serving trial subpoenas on Eric Zahn and the “Valencia BMW
Custodian of Records” was unnecessary as Plaintiff was aware from his
deposition that Mr. Zahn was the designated custodian of records.  Finally, BMWNA argues that $597.56 in serving
trial subpoenas on Luis Soto and the “Century West BMW Custodian of Records”
was unnecessary as Plaintiff was aware that Mr. Soto had been designated as the
custodian of records. 
In opposition, Plaintiff argues
that LADWP and other witness subpoenas were necessary to potentially rebut and
impeach the arguments raised by Defendant’s experts.  (Opp. at p.3.)  Plaintiff also argues that the purportedly
“duplicative” subpoenas on Mr. Zahn/Valencia BMW custodian of records and Mr.
Soto/Century West BMW custodian of records was necessary and reasonably prudent
because the entities may have changed their designations and there was no
guarantee that Mr. Zahn and/or Mr. Soto were still employed or may have had job
changes.  (Id. at p.4.)  Plaintiff argues that the subpoenas on the
custodians were necessary because Defendant did not stipulate to the
authenticity and admissibility of documents until late in the trial preparation
process.   
 
Service of process costs are allowable. 
While BMWNA argues that the costs were not necessary, the Court has been
given very little information regarding who these witnesses are and why they
were necessary.  The Court does find that
it was unnecessary to serve custodian subpoenas as these witnesses were already
deposed, and any issue regarding authenticity of documents had already been
fully aired. As it turned out, there were no such issues. Moreover, unless BMWNA
denied its affiliation with a witness, it was unnecessary to subpoena party
affiliated witnesses. Therefore, the Court will tax this cost in the amount of $597.56.

Thus, the motion to tax the costs
in Item 5 is granted in the amount of $597.56. 

E.     Item 16: Other - Expert Witness Fees
In the
Amended Memorandum of Costs at Attachment 16, Plaintiff seeks $20,444 in expert
witness fees.  (Am. Memo. of Costs at p.
9 of 12.)  The costs are sought regarding
expert Dan Calef from October 24, 2022 to August 14, 2023.  
BMWNA moves to strike $7,365 in
expert witness fees.  BMWNA argues that
Mr. Calef’s hours are unreasonable as he seeks 63 hours for “Preparation Time”
in this lemon-law case; 36.55 hours from August 8 to 14, 2023 for the trial,
though he testified for approximately 4 hours total on August 10 and 14, 2023;
10.25 hours on August 9, 2023 when he did not appear for trial and the jury was
sent home early; and 2 hours on August 11, 2023 when the courtroom was dark and
no testimony given.  
Plaintiff argues in opposition that
Mr. Calef’s fees are warranted because he was forced to conduct 2 separate
evaluations and testing sessions of the vehicle over and above his attendance
at Defendant’s 2 noticed inspections of the vehicle, which then necessitated
Plaintiff’s expert to conduct an additional vehicle inspection thereafter.  With respect to the trial, Plaintiff provides
further explanation: (1) August 8, 2023 – Mr. Calef spent 4.8 hours preparing
for his expert testimony at trial; (2) August 9, 2023 – Mr. Caref travel to
Burbank from Norco to meet with Plaintiff’s counsel for trial preparation and
spent 8.5 hours in preparing for his direct testimony; (3) August 10, 2023 – he
testified on direct examination and traveled home; (4) August 11 and 13, 2023 –
he spent 4 hours preparing for his cross-examination; and (5) August 14, 2023 –
he traveled to Burbank to continue his expert testimony, testified on
cross-examination, and returned home. 
(Opp. at pp.4-5.)  The Court finds
that some of the time spent in preparing for trial, attending the trial,
testifying, and traveling were necessary and reasonable. 
However, the Court will reduce the
costs sought in Item 16.  The whole
notion of “expert” testimony in this case is somewhat overstated. The alleged
defect, though variously described, turned out to be nothing more than this:
when plugged in, the vehicle did not charge. Mr. Calef operated as a person who
knew something about vehicles, and, because of his independence as an expert,
could be relied upon to reliably plug the vehicle in and observe that it did or
did not charge.  He also took out his
iPhone and recorded that it was not charging. He could offer no causative
explanation or expert analysis as to why the condition occurred, he simply
verified its existence, thereby bolstering the credibility of Plaintiff’s own
similar observations.  He also observed
Defendant’s tests, which had similar results. This was simple eyewitness
testimony. The fact that one needed to prepare for hours to give simple
eyewitness testimony raises credibility issues regarding the claimed
expenditures of time.
As such, the motion to strike/tax
the costs in Item 16 for expert witness fees in the amount of $7,365 is granted.
