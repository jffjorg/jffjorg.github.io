Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to unseal the court records in a case involving an unlawful detainer action. The plaintiff, Dana Ingram, is seeking to unseal the records, arguing that because the case was converted from an unlawful detainer action to a general civil action, the presumption of openness should apply. The judge notes that the case was initially classified as a limited civil unlawful detainer case, but was later converted to a general civil action. The judge finds that there are no overriding interests that support sealing the records and that the current confidentiality is not narrowly tailored. The judge also notes that there is no opposition to the motion. Therefore, the judge is inclined to grant the motion to unseal the records, which will apply to the entirety of the court's records in the action. The judge orders the parties to attend the hearing to inquire about a proposed payment plan and warns that if a plan is not forthcoming, the motion will be granted.
