SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of the lease of residence in Santa
Clarita, California by Defendant Besian Shaquiri (Defendant) from Plaintiff MPA
123 LLC (MPA) beginning on or about 3/15/18. 
Plaintiff Pilar Alonso (Alonso), who is currently 81 years old, is alleged
to be the sole owner, member and employee of MPA.
 
Plaintiffs allege that shortly after Defendant moved into
the residence he began to make complaints about the condition of the
residence.  Plaintiffs allege that
Defendant claimed he was a licensed contractor, insisted on making repairs,
which Plaintiffs claims were unnecessary, himself and intimidated Alonso into
allowing him to do so or did not obtain permission to make certain
repairs/alterations.  Plaintiff alleges
that Defendant demanded payment for the repairs and/or rent offsets.  Plaintiff also contends that Defendant
refused to comply with rent increases imposed over the years of his
tenancy.    
 
On 5/29/24, Plaintiffs filed this action against
Defendant for: (1) Business & Professions Code 7031, (2) Fraud/Intentional

Defendant was served with the Complaint on 6/22/24.  On 7/16/24, Defendant filed (electronically served
on 7/15/24) the Answer to the Complaint. 
After Defendant’s counsel failed to respond to Plaintiffs’ counsel’s
meet and confer efforts regarding the issues Plaintiffs had with the Answer, on
8/13/24, Plaintiff filed and served the instant demurrer to each of the 47
affirmative defenses asserted in Defendant’s Answer to the complaint.  (See Frank Decl. and Declaration Re
Automatic Extension.  Defendant has not
opposed or otherwise responded to the demurrer.
 
ANALYSIS
 
A demurrer may be based on the grounds that the answer fails
to state facts sufficient to constitute a defense and/or is uncertain.  CCP 430.20(a), (b).  
 
Affirmative defenses cannot merely set forth legal
conclusions but must set forth supporting facts with as much detail as required
in a complaint.  See FPI
Development, Inc. (1991) 231 CA3d 367, 384. 
Mere legal conclusions are inadequate to state a valid affirmative
defense.  See Houk (1943)
58 CA2d 573, 582; City of Mountain View (1975) 54 CA3d 72, 84.
 
Defendant has failed to set forth sufficient facts to
support the numerous affirmative defenses asserted in the Answer which also
renders the affirmative defenses uncertain. 

 
CONCLUSION
 
The demurrer is sustained.  Due to the liberal policy of allowing leave
to amend and because this is the original answer, Defendant is given the
opportunity to try to cure the defects in his affirmative defenses.
 
A First Amended Answer is due within 20 days.
