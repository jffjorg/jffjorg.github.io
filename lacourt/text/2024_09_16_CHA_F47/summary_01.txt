And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the plaintiffs, Pilar Alonso and MPA 123 LLC, against the defendant, Besian Shaquiri. The demurrer challenges the defendant's 47 affirmative defenses asserted in his answer to the complaint. The Judge has sustained the demurrer, finding that the defendant has failed to set forth sufficient facts to support his affirmative defenses, which also renders them uncertain.

The Judge has given the defendant 20 days to file a First Amended Answer to cure the defects in his affirmative defenses. The Judge has also warned counsel for the parties that failure to properly electronically bookmark exhibits may result in matters being continued or sanctions being imposed.

The case arises from a lease of a residence in Santa Clarita, California, between the defendant and the plaintiff, MPA 123 LLC. The defendant allegedly made complaints about the condition of the residence and claimed to be a licensed contractor, making repairs without permission. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant demanded payment for the repairs and/or rent offsets and refused to comply with rent increases. The plaintiffs have brought various claims against the defendant, including business & professions code 7031, fraud/intentional misrepresentation, and breach of written contract.

The Judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 430.20(a) and (b), which provide that a demurrer may be based on the grounds that the answer fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a defense and/or is uncertain. The Judge has also cited various case law, including FPI Development, Inc. v. Superior Court (1991) 231 CA3d 367, 384, and Houk v. Superior Court (1943) 58 CA2d 573, 582.
