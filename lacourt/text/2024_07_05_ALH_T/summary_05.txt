The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case 22STCV06882, denying the Plaintiff's motion for a protective order and sanctions. The Plaintiff, Alex Canzano, had sought to prevent the deposition of their expert, which was scheduled to take place on June 5, 2024, and requested $1,766.65 in sanctions. The Defendant, Scott Hayman, opposed the motion and sought $647.50 in sanctions. The Judge denied the motion as moot, since the deposition did not occur on the scheduled date. Additionally, the Judge denied both parties' requests for sanctions due to the lack of meaningful meet and confer efforts between the parties.
