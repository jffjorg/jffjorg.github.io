 Case Number:  22STCV11248    Hearing Date:   July 5, 2024    Dept:  T Motion for Summary JudgmentMoving Parties:  Defendants Santa Monica Dental Practice and Joseph Sabet, DDS The court considered the moving papers. No opposition or reply papers were filed. BACKGROUND On April 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed this action against Defendants alleging negligence/medical malpractice.  Plaintiff alleges dental malpractice against Defendants Santa Monica Dental Practice and Joseph Sabet D.D.S.  Plaintiff alleges Defendants performed root canals on two teeth shortly after Plaintiff first visited them in June 2018 about pain in those teeth.  Plaintiff alleges the pain returned in December 2020 and he visited another dentist on January 19, 2021.  Plaintiff discovered on that date that Defendants had improperly performed the root canals.  Plaintiff served Defendants on January 14, 2022 with a notice letter under CCP §364.   On April 17, 2024, Defendants filed this motion for summary judgment.  As of July 1, 2024, no opposition has been filed.  On June 28, 2024, Defendants filed a Notice of Non-Opposition.  LEGAL STANDARD The elements of a medical malpractice cause of action are (1) the duty of the professional to use such skill, prudence, and diligence as other members of his profession commonly possess and exercise; (2) a breach of that duty; (3) a proximate causal connection between the negligent conduct and the resulting injury; and (4) actual loss or damage resulting from the professional's negligence.  (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 463, 468 fn 2.)   The standard of skill, knowledge and care prevailing in a medical community is ordinarily a matter within the knowledge of experts.  (Jambazian v. Borden (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 836, 844.)  “The standard of care for physicians is the reasonable degree of skill, knowledge and care ordinarily possessed and exercised by members of the medical profession under similar circumstances.  The test for determining familiarity with the standard of care is knowledge of similar conditions.  Geographical location may be a factor considered in making that determination, but, by itself, does not provide a practical basis for measuring similar circumstances.”  (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center, supra, at 159 Cal.App.4th at 470.) Whether the standard of care in the community has been breached presents a basic issue of fact in a malpractice action which can only be proved by expert opinion testimony unless the medical question is within the common knowledge of laypersons.  (Id. at 470, fn. 1; 1 Witkin, Cal. Evid. (6th ed. 2021), Opinion, §52.)  “[A]n opinion unsupported by reasons or explanations does not establish the absence of a material fact issue for trial, as required for summary judgment.”  (Golden Eagle Refinery Co., Inc. v. Associated Intern. Ins. Co. (2001) 85 Cal.App.4th 1300, 1315 (citing Kelley v. Trunk (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 519, 524).  Accordingly, where a plaintiff provides proper opposing expert testimony via a declaration, a triable issue of material fact is raised which precludes summary judgment.  (Jambazian, supra, 25 Cal.App.4th at 844.)  The absence of opinion evidence on this issue is fatal to the plaintiff’s cause of action.  (Willard v. Hagemeister (1981) 121 Cal.App.3d 406, 412.)  An expert declaration is admissible as long as Defendants’ expert states in detail his qualifications and the factual basis for his opinion.  (Kelley, supra, 66 Cal.App.4th at 524.)   Expert testimony is also required to establish the element of causation in a medical malpractice action.  “The law is well settled that in a personal injury action causation must be proven within a reasonable medical probability based on competent expert testimony. Mere possibility alone is insufficient to establish a prima facie case. That there is a distinction between a reasonable medical probability and a medical possibility needs little discussion. There can be many possible causes, indeed, an infinite number of circumstances that can produce an injury or disease. A possible cause only becomes probable when, in the absence of other reasonable causal explanations, it becomes more likely than not that the injury was a result of its action. This is the outer limit of inference upon which an issue may be submitted to the jury.”  (Jennings v. Palomar Pomerado Health Systems, Inc. (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 1108, 1118 (trial court properly struck medical expert testimony on issue of causation where expert’s opinion failed to provide a reasoned explanation regarding the etiology connecting plaintiff’s infected subcutaneous tissue to the nidus inside peritoneal cavity where retractor was retained).   “A party is entitled to summary judgment only if it meets its initial burden of showing there are no triable issues of fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. This is true even if the opposing party fails to file any opposition. The court's assessment of whether the moving party has carried its burden—and therefore caused a shift—occurs before the court's evaluation of the opposing party's papers. Therefore, the burden on the motion does not initially shift as a result of what is, or is not, contained in the opposing papers.”  (Mosley v. Pacific Specialty Insurance Company (2020) 49 Cal.App.5th 417, 434–435 (landlord’s failure to address issue of whether they were aware of their tenant’s marijuana growing operation was not grounds to grant summary judgment where moving party failed to satisfy its initial burden as to the issue); Thatcher v. Lucky Stores, Inc. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1081, 1086-1087 (court cannot grant summary judgment based merely on lack of opposition; court must first determine if the moving party has satisfied its burden).) In addition, the evidence and affidavits of the moving party are construed strictly, while those of the opponent are liberally read.  (Government Employees Ins. Co. v. Sup. Ct. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 95, 100. “All doubts as to the propriety of granting the motion (whether there is any issue of material fact [Code of Civil Procedure] § 437c) are to be resolved in favor of the party opposing the motion (i.e., a denial of summary judgment).” (Hamburg v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 497, 502.)DISCUSSION Defendants move for summary judgment of the entire complaint on grounds that (1) the action is barred based on the statute of limitations under CCP §340.5; (2) Defendants complied with the applicable standard of care at all times; and (3) no act or omission by Defendants caused or contributed to Plaintiffs’ alleged injury.  Plaintiff did not file an opposition.  However, despite the lack of an opposition, Defendants must still satisfy their initial burden in order to obtain summary judgment. A.  Statute of Limitations “In an action for injury or death against a health care provider based upon such person's alleged professional negligence, the time for the commencement of action shall be three years after the date of injury or one year after the plaintiff discovers, or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered, the injury, whichever occurs first.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 340.5.) As used in section 340.5, “injury” means a person's physical condition and its negligent cause. (Gutierrez v. Mofid (1985) 39 Cal.3d 892, 896.) The injury is not necessarily the ultimate harm suffered but instead occurs when appreciable harm is first manifested. (Brewer v. Remington (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 14, 24.)  Whether there has been a belated discovery of the cause of action in malpractice cases essentially is a question of fact, and only where reasonable minds can draw but one conclusion from the evidence does the question become a matter of law.  (Drexler v. Petersen (2016) 4 Cal.App.5th 1181, 1188-1189.)  Section 340.5’s discovery rule “sets forth two alternate tests for triggering the limitations period: (1) a subjective test requiring actual suspicion by the plaintiff that the injury was caused by wrongdoing; and (2) an objective test requiring a showing that a reasonable person would have suspected the injury was caused by wrongdoing.  The first to occur under these two tests begins the limitations period.” (Kitzig v. Nordquist (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 1384, 1391.) Under the first test, the plaintiff need only suspect someone has done something wrong, which does not require the plaintiff to know the specific facts (e.g., medical cause, diagnosis) necessary to establish a medical negligence claim. (Norgart v. Upjohn Co. (1999) 21 Cal.4th 383, 397–398; Knowles v. Superior Court (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 1290, 1295.) A plaintiff has presumptive knowledge of the negligent injury once he has “notice or information of circumstances to put a reasonable person on inquiry, or has the opportunity to obtain knowledge from sources open to his investigation.” (Gutierrez v. Mofid, supra, 39 Cal.3d at p. 896; accord, Kitzig v. Nordquist, supra, 81 Cal.App.4th at p. 1391 [one-year statute of limitations begins to run when plaintiff suspects or should suspect wrongdoing caused injury].) Defendant argues that the statute of limitations as to tooth #2 began to run as early as June 29, 2018 and as to tooth #3, it began to run no later than August 4, 2020.  Based on Defendants’ evidence, Plaintiff underwent a root canal on October 2017. (Defendant’s SSUMF No. 3.)  On June 29, 2018, Plaintiff was examined by Defendant Sabet, who advised him to seek an endodontist consult for a possible Apico or re-treatment of tooth #2.  (Defendant’s SSUMF No. 7.)  On August 20, 2020, Dr. Homyak advised Plaintiff to see an endodontist, after noting that the gingiva around tooth #2 and 3 were inflamed.  (Defendant’s SSUMF No. 24.) The mere fact that Plaintiff was advised to see an endodontist on these dates does not establish as an issue of law that a “reasonable person would have suspected the injury was caused by wrongdoing.”  (Kitzig, supra, 81 Cal.App.4th at 1391 (emphasis added.)  Even if the advice to see an endodontist alerted Plaintiff to an injury, reasonable minds could differ as to whether Plaintiff should have known that his injury was the result of negligence or some wrongdoing or that Plaintiff was placed on inquiry notice as a result of the advice.  As such, the motion for summary judgment based on statute of limitations is denied. B.  Based on the undisputed evidence, Defendants did not breach any applicable standard of care, nor were Plaintiff’s injuries caused by Defendants’ act or omission Defendants negate Plaintiff’s allegations of breach of the standard of care and causation with the declaration of Thomas Jovicich, D.M.D.  Jovicich testifies that based on his review of the relevant records, Defendants did not breach any applicable standard of care, nor were Plaintiff’s injuries caused by any act or omission of Defendants.  (Jovicich Dec., ¶¶10-13.)   The burden therefore shifts to Plaintiff to submit admissible expert evidence raising a triable issue of material fact as to breach and causation. Plaintiff did not file an opposition.   As such, no triable issues of fact remain as to Plaintiff’s negligence/dental malpractice claim.  Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED. CONCLUSION Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED.   No triable issues of fact remain as to Plaintiff’s complaint.  Based on the undisputed evidence, Defendants did not breach any applicable standard of care, nor did they cause Plaintiff’s injury.  (Defendants’ SSUMF Nos. 80 and 97.)
