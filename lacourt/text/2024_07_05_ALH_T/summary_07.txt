And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Neil William Smith, is seeking to quash the service of summons in this case, which was filed by the plaintiff, Annie Marie Burks, on March 17, 2022. The plaintiff is alleging that the defendant physically assaulted and battered her. The defendant's motion to quash is based on the grounds that the service of summons was not completed properly.

The court has reviewed the proof of service, which was filed with the court on August 1, 2023, and has found it to be invalid. The proof of service is invalid because it lacks a date and time of service, it asserts both personal and substituted service, and it has conflicting dates. Additionally, the defendant declares that he was no longer residing at the address where the summons and complaint were served by May 31, 2022.

As a result, the court has granted the defendant's motion to quash service of summons. Without proper service, the court cannot maintain jurisdiction over the defendant, and any judgment is void.
