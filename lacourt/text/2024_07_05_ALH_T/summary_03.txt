```

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant's motion for summary judgment and application to seal. The ruling finds that Defendant did not owe a duty to Plaintiff and that Plaintiff failed to raise a triable issue of material fact. The Judge holds that the Fleet Agreement defines couriers as independent contractors and that Postmates disclaimed any authority to control the means of delivery. The ruling also finds that the doctrine of respondent superior is not applicable in this case.
