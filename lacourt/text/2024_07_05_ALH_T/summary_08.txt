And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge rules that the Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED. The Plaintiff did not file an opposition, but the Judge finds that the Defendants have satisfied their initial burden in showing that there are no triable issues of fact.

The Judge first addresses the statute of limitations, finding that the Plaintiff's claims are not barred by the one-year statute of limitations under CCP §340.5. The Judge concludes that the Plaintiff did not have reason to suspect that his injury was caused by wrongdoing until he visited another dentist on January 19, 2021, and thus the statute of limitations did not begin to run until then.

The Judge then addresses the Defendant's breach of the standard of care and causation, finding that the Plaintiff has failed to provide admissible expert evidence raising a triable issue of material fact as to breach and causation. The Judge concludes that the Defendants did not breach any applicable standard of care, nor did they cause the Plaintiff's injury.

Based on the undisputed evidence, the Judge grants the Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment and finds that no triable issues of fact remain as to the Plaintiff's complaint.
