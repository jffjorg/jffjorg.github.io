And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the case. The case was dismissed because the plaintiff's prior attorney, Sedaghati, failed to serve the defendant within two years. The plaintiff's new attorney, Kurtz, argues that the failure to serve the defendant was not the plaintiff's fault, but rather the fault of Sedaghati. The judge agrees, finding that the plaintiff did what a reasonable client would do in the circumstances and that the plaintiff should not be punished for the fault of her prior attorney. The judge grants the motion, allowing the plaintiff to revive the case and continue pursuing her claims against the defendant.
