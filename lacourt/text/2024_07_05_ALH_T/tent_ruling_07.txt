 Case Number:  22STCV09477    Hearing Date:   July 5, 2024    Dept:  T Motion to Quash Service of Summons Moving Party: Defendant Neil William Smith Responding Party: Plaintiff Annie Marie Burks  Tentative Ruling: GRANTED.  BACKGROUND  This case was commenced on March 17, 2022 when Annie Marie Burks (Plaintiff) filed a Complaint alleging that Neil William Smith (Defendant) physically assaulted and battered her. The applicable proof of service was filed with the Court on August 1, 2023. The motion now before the Court is Defendant Neil Smith’s Motion to Quash Service of Summons (the Motion). Plaintiff, who is pro per, filed a “Declaration to Obtain an Order to Vacate” the Motion. As the Motion has not yet been ruled on, no such “order to vacate” could be granted at this stage, therefore, the Court views these documents as opposition papers to the instant Motion. No reply papers were filed.  DISCUSSIONApplicable Law   Complainants have the initial burden to evidence valid statutory service of a summons and complaint. (Dill v. Berquist Const. Co., Inc. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1439-40; Floveyor Internat. v. Sup. Ct. (1997) 59 Cal. App. 4th 789, 794.) Court findings as to conflicting proof regarding whether a summons and complaint were properly served are upheld if based upon substantial evidence. (Stafford v. Mach (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1174, 1182.)  Pursuant to CCP 418.10(a)(1), a defendant may move to quash service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court. Without proper service, a court cannot maintain jurisdiction over the defendant and any judgment is void. California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 415.10, 415.20, 415.30, and 415.50 describe four methods of service within California: (1) personal delivery of copy of summons and complaint to person to be served; (2) delivery of a copy of summons and complaint to someone else at defendant’s usual residence or place of business; (3) service by mail coupled with acknowledgment of receipt of summons; and (4) service by publication.ANALYSIS The Court will grant Defendant Neil William Smith’s Motion because service was not completed properly. As aforementioned, Plaintiff here has the initial burden to evidence valid statutory service of a summons and complaint. The proof of service filed with the Court on August 1, 2023 is invalid for numerous reasons.  First, Plaintiff asserts that the documents were delivered by personal service in part 5(a), however, no time nor date is written. (Declaration of Andrea Cook, hereinafter, Cook Decl., Exh. F.) Second, Plaintiff asserts that the documents were served by both personal service and substituted service. Substituted service occurs in place of personal service, not in addition to it. (Id.) Third, there are conflicting dates within the document. In part 5, box b(4) is checked, indicating that the summons and complaint were mailed on February 22, 2022, prior to the Complaint ever being filed with the Court. Then, the very next page has the same February 22, 2022 date crossed out, and instead October 24, 2022 is written in, therefore, it is unclear as to which date was intended to be recorded. (Id.) Fourth and finally, assuming the October 24, 2022 address is the address intended to be used, Defendant declares he was no longer residing at 488 E. Ocean Blvd., Unit 1614, Long Beach, CA 90802 by May 31, 2022. (Cook Decl., Exh. E, ¶3.) Therefore, service to that address would have been invalid. CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, Defendant’s Motion to Quash Service of Summons is GRANTED.
