And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendants' motion to bifurcate the trial on the issue of liability and damages. The court finds that bifurcation is necessary to avoid wasting court time, promote settlements, and simplify the issues for the jury. The court also notes that the plaintiff's damages claims are extensive and will require the testimony of multiple medical and other experts, which may prejudice the jury's ability to make an impartial decision. Therefore, the court has concluded that bifurcation is necessary to ensure a fair trial. The damages phase of the trial will be deferred until after the liability issue has been resolved.
