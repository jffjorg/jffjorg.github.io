And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Ceramic Tile Art, Inc.'s unopposed motion for summary judgment in this wrongful death case. The plaintiff, Maria Del Socorro Sanchez-Quezada, brought the case on behalf of her minor daughters and as the successor in interest of the decedent, Juan Rodrigo Gonzalez-Morin, who died from silicosis caused by occupational exposure to silica-containing products. The defendant argued that it did not supply any products to which the decedent was exposed and provided a declaration stating that its sole business consists of installing stonework at customers' homes and businesses and that it does not supply or manufacture products. The plaintiff did not file an opposition to the motion, and the judge found that the defendant has met its initial burden by showing that the decedent was never exposed to any products manufactured or supplied by the defendant. As a result, the judge granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment, finding that the plaintiff cannot prevail on any of her claims.
