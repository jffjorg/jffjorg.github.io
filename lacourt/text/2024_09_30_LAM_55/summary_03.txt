And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the motion by Defendant's counsel to be relieved as attorney of record in a contract dispute case between Career Group, Inc. and Vinivia, Inc. The judge notes that the motion is properly filed and the declaration and proposed order comply with the required format. However, the judge finds that the motion lacks a proof of service, which is a required step under the rules. The judge also finds that the movant's declaration shows a cognizable ground for withdrawal due to client conduct that renders it unreasonably difficult to carry out the representation. Since no opposing document has been filed showing prejudice to the client, the judge is inclined to grant the motion once the proof of service is provided.
