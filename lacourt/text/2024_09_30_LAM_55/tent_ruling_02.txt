LEGAL STANDARD
Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, subdivision (b),
provides, “Except as otherwise expressly provided by statute, a prevailing
party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or
proceeding.” 
“A party may not recover attorney fees unless
expressly authorized by statute or contract.” Code Civ. Proc., § 1021. Civil
Code §1794(d) provides that a buyer who prevails in an action under that
section “shall be allowed by the court to recover as a part of the judgment a
sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including attorney's
fees based on actual time expended, determined by the court to have been
reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and the
prosecution of such action.”
The moving party bears the burden of establishing
entitlement to attorney fees. Christian Research Institute v. Alnor
(2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1320.  
 
 
 
 
ANALYSIS
I. Whether Plaintiffs are the Prevailing Party
The Act does not define the term “prevailing party.”
Civ. Code, § 1794, subd. (d). Most courts take a “pragmatic” approach to
assessing whether a buyer has prevailed under the Act. See e.g., Wohlgemuth
v. Caterpillar Inc. (2012) 207 Cal.App.4th 1252, 1264 (Wohlgemuth);
MacQuiddy v. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (2015) 233 Cal.App.4th 1036, 1047.
Under this analysis, the trial court determines which party succeeded on a
practical level, by considering the extent to which each party realized its
litigation objectives. Wohlgemuth, supra, 207 Cal.App.4th at p. 1264. 
In MacQuiddy, supra, 233 Cal.App.4th at
p. 1048, the Court of Appeal held that the plaintiff was not a prevailing party
under Civil Code section 1794, subdivision (d). Although the plaintiff secured
repurchase of his vehicle for $¿68,000, the manufacturer never contested liability
for this amount and admitted liability in its answer to the complaint. This
amount was never litigated. The only issue the plaintiff litigated was the
civil penalty amount, and the trial court ruled against the plaintiff. The MacQuiddy
court found that the plaintiff was not a prevailing party because he did not
achieve his main litigation objective of obtaining a civil penalty. Ibid.
Here, Plaintiffs purchased the vehicle for a purchase
price of $356,020.26. Saeedian Decl. ¶ 19. The parties agreed to settle the
case by way of Plaintiffs’ acceptance of Defendant’s 998 Offer to Compromise
(“998 Offer”), which stated that Defendant would repurchase the vehicle for $363,000.00.
Saeedian Decl. ¶¶ 25-26. The 998 Offer did not resolve whether Plaintiffs are a
prevailing party but allowed Plaintiffs to elect between $5,000 in attorney’s
fees or seeking reasonable attorney’s fees in the court.  Hooper Decl., at p. 192, Ex. L ¶ 5.
Defendant argues that it had indicated to Plaintiff
Bui prior to litigation that it was willing to repurchase the vehicle and then Plaintiffs
sought damages in this lawsuit over any repurchase payment based on Defendant's
delay. Defendant reasons that Plaintiffs ultimately accepted a settlement for
repurchase of the vehicle in the 998 Ofer that did not include those damages
and thus Plaintiffs failed to accomplish their litigation objectives.  Opposition at p. 6.  
However, unlike MacQuiddy, Defendant did not
concede liability throughout the litigation. In MacQuiddy, “monetary
judgment was for an amount never disputed and on an issue never litigated
because it was conceded …[and] … Mercedes-Benz immediately admitted liability
for failure to replace or repurchase the car and offered to do so, the amount
of restitution was not contested, and the entire trial concerned the civil
penalty” Id. at 1049. Defendant shows no evidence that the settlement
amount in the 998 Offer is what it would have paid to Plaintiffs absent
litigation. If Defendant always intended to repurchase the car for the
settlement amount, it could have limited attorney’s fees by making a section
988 settlement offer at the beginning of litigation, it did not.
Because the parties disputed whether Defendant would
repurchase the vehicle and at what amount, Plaintiffs achieved their implicit
litigation objective of requiring Defendant to repurchase the vehicle at a
favorable price.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs
are the prevailing party.  
 
II. Whether Plaintiffs Requested Attorney Fees are
Reasonable
“A trial court assessing attorney fees begins with a
touchstone or lodestar figure, based on the ‘careful compilation of the time
spent and reasonable hourly compensation of each attorney ... involved in the
presentation of the case.’” Christian Research Institute v. Alnor (2008)
165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1321 (quoting Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1131–1132). The lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on
consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the
fair market value for the legal services provided. See Serrano v. Priest
(1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49 (discussing factors relevant to proper attorneys’ fees
award).
Plaintiffs have submitted a declaration showing that
its attorneys incurred a total of 33 billable hours, including time spent
working on Plaintiff’s case on this motion, and an estimated additional 5.5
hours to review the Opposition, draft a Reply, and prepare for and attend the
hearing. Declaration of Michael Saeedian (“Saeedian Decl.), at ¶ 28.  
The requested hours break down as follows: 
Michael Saeedian 3.9 hours at $695 per hour for a
total of $2,710.50
Adina Ostoia 9.8 hours at $695 for a total of
$6,811.00
Christopher Urner 6.9 hours at $525 per hour for a
total of $3,622.50
Jorge L. Acosta (attorney hours) 6.7 hours at $350 per
hour for a total of $2,345.00
Jorge L. Acosta (law clerk hours) 11.1 hours at a rate
of $250 for a total of $2,775.00
Stefany Montoya 0.1 hours at a rate of $350 for a
total of $35.00
The total requested attorney’s fee is $18,299.00. See
Saeedian Decl., at ¶ 28.
Additionally, Plaintiffs request costs in the amount
of 927.90. 
Defendant argues that the Court should use its
discretion to reduce the fees requested by Plaintiffs to no more than
$5,945.50. See Declaration of Donna Hooper (“Hooper Decl.,), Ex A.
Defendant, however, does not challenge Plaintiff’s demand for costs. 
Hourly rates
The hourly rates for attorneys Saeedian and Ostoia are
unreasonable given the routine nature of the tasks performed in this Lemon Law
case. The Court concludes that an hourly rate of $425 for both of these
attorneys is a reasonable hourly rate. The Court similarly concludes that the
hourly rate for attorney Urner should be reduced to $375. The hourly rates for
attorneys Acosta and Montoya are reasonable. 
Billing Entries
Defendant argues that the claimed fees improperly include
time spent working on the retainer agreement, reviewing objection-only
responses, duplicative or clerical tasks, and assorted tasks that were “[e]xcessive,
unnecessary and duplicative.  Defendant
also argues that the time spent preparing the Complaint and discovery responses
should be reduced because they were based on templates and required little
original work.  
The Court also finds that the number of hours billed is
unreasonable. While there is nothing inherently wrong with using templates to complete
tasks more quickly, time savings should be reflected in the billable hours. As
their name suggests, the attorneys of The Lemon Pros, LLP specialize in lemon
law cases and regularly litigate such cases. See Saeedian Decl. at ¶¶ 5-8.
Many of the documents drafted were simple and required only minor edits to
existing templates. Hooper Decl., ¶¶ 10,19, Exhibit A. 
The Court reduces Acosta’s time preparing the retainer
agreement and tasks related to the retainer agreement by 1 hour because the
time billed is excessive for such a routine task. 
The time billed by Urner to prepare the template
complaint is reduced by 1 hour; the form complaint does not require much time
to finalize. Similarly, the Court reduces his time by another 4 hours for
estimated time spent on the reply. The time billed by Ostoia to prepare
template discovery requests and objection only responses in a routine Lemon Law
case is wildly excessive. The Court reduces her hours on these tasks by 4.5
hours. 
The Court therefore grants reasonable attorney fees as
follows:
Michael Saeedian 3.9 hours at $425 per hour for a
total of $1,657.50
Adina Ostoia 5.3 hours at $425 for a total of $2,252.50
Christopher Urner 1.9 hours at $375 per hour for a
total of $712.50
Jorge L. Acosta (attorney hours) 5.7 hours at $350 per
hour for a total of $1,995
Jorge L. Acosta (law clerk hours) 11.1 hours at a rate
of $250 for a total of $2,775
Stefany Montoya 0.1 hours at a rate of $350 for a
total of $35.00 
Total Fees Granted: $9,427.50
 
Because Defendants did not file a motion to tax the
costs in Plaintiff’s memorandum of costs, the Court awards the entirety of the
costs totaling $927.90.
 
 
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, the Court
grants Plaintiff’s motion for attorney’s fees and costs in the reduced amount
of $10,355.40.
