And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the Plaintiffs' motion for attorney's fees in a reduced amount of $9,427.50. The judge determined that the Plaintiffs are the prevailing party because they achieved their implicit litigation objective of requiring the Defendant to repurchase the vehicle at a favorable price. The judge also reduced the requested attorney's fees because some of the time billed by the attorneys was unreasonable. The judge awarded the Plaintiffs their requested costs in the amount of $927.90. The total granted fees and costs are $10,355.40.
