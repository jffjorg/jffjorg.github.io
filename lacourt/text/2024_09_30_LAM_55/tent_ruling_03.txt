 Case Number:  24STCV11687    Hearing Date:   September 30, 2024    Dept:  55 24STCV11687
Motion to be Relieved as Attorney of Record
 
This is a contract dispute case brought by Plaintiff Career
Group, Inc. against Vinivia, Inc. Counsel for Defendant Vinivia has filed a
motion to be relieved as counsel. 
“The determination whether to grant or deny an
attorney’s motion to withdraw as counsel of record lies within the sound
discretion of the trial court, having in mind whether such withdrawal might
work an injustice in the handling of the case.” Lempert v. Sup. Ct.
(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1173. 
Here, the form notice, declaration, and proposed order
sufficiently comply with the requirements for a motion to be relieved as
counsel. See Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362. However, Defendant has not filed a proof of service as is
required under the rules. 
Moving counsel’s declaration shows a cognizable ground
for withdrawal: Client conduct that renders is unreasonably difficult for the
lawyer to carry out the representation. Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 1.16(b)(4). 
Finally, no opposing document has been filed showing
any prejudice to the client. See Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 1.16(d). 
The Court cannot grant the motion without Defendant’s
counsel providing a proof of service of the motion, declaration, and proposed
order on both Defendant and Plaintiff. Upon showing the proof of serve, the Court
would grant the motion.
