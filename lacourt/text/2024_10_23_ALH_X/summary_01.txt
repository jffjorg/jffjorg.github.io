And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the application for a right to attach order in the amount of $2,797,250. However, the judge has denied the request to exempt property necessary to support Xiang Li and Michael Li and their families. The judge found that the defendants did not meet their burden of proof to exempt the property and did not provide evidence of what the property is and why it is necessary to support them and their families, as required by law. Before issuing a writ of attachment, the plaintiff must file an undertaking to pay the defendant any amount the defendant may recover for any wrongful attachment by the plaintiff. The judge has also ordered that no writ shall issue for any defendant until the plaintiff posts a $10,000 undertaking for that defendant.
