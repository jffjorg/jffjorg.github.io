  Case Number:  24NNCV03266    Hearing Date:   October 23, 2024    Dept:  X APPLICATION
FOR A RIGHT TO ATTACH ORDERS AND ORDERS FOR ISSUANCE OF WRIT OF ATTACHMENT
AFTER HEARING (1575; 6847)The application for a right to attach order is GRANTED in the amount of $2,797,250. Exemptions are granted as to Xiang Li’s Social Security benefits and Michael Li’s unemployment benefits. The attachable property is limited to that described in Code of Civil Procedure section 487.010(c)-(d).Xiang Li and Michael Li do not meet their burden of proof to exempt property necessary to
support themselves or their family. Xiang and Michael do not provide evidence
of what the property is, and why the property is necessary to support them and
their families, or a financial statement (Code Civ. Proc., § 703.530). The
Court DENIES Michael Li and Xiang Li’s request to exempt property necessary to
support themselves and their family.Before the issuance of a writ of attachment, the plaintiff is required to file an undertaking to pay the defendant any amount the defendant may recover for any wrongful attachment by the plaintiff in the action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 489.210.) The undertaking ordinarily is $10,000. (Code Civ. Proc., § 489.220.) No writ shall issue for any Defendant until Plaintiff posts a $10,000 undertaking for that Defendant.
