And here is the English text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Judge rules that Defendant Greg Royston's motion to offset attorney's fee awards is granted. The Judge orders that Plaintiff's attorney, Vip Bhola, must file a Partial Satisfaction of Judgment in the amount of $17,723.12, and Defendant Royston must file a Full Satisfaction of Judgment in the related case. The Judge also orders Defendant Royston to give notice, unless waived. The offset of attorney's fee awards is appropriate because the parties have conflicting attorney's fee awards against each other, and equitable considerations make it appropriate to offset these awards.
