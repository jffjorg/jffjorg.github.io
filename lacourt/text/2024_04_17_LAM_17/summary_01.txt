The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for attorney fees filed by Plaintiff Debra Mouton against General Motors LLC. The Plaintiff is awarded $26,702.50 in attorney fees, consisting of $17,932.50 for Quill & Arrow and $8,770 for West Point Legal. The court reduced the hourly rates of the attorneys from $950 to $400 per hour, citing case law and the simplicity of the case.

The court declined to award a multiplier enhancement and did not consider a cost award as the Plaintiff did not submit a verified memorandum of costs.
