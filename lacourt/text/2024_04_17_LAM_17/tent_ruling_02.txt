  Date:  April 17, 2024




 
Defendant Crowley, the Fire
Chief of LAFD’s motion to quash service of summons is GRANTED.
 
On
12/13/2021, Freedom to Choose L.A. and 4,499 other Plaintiffs filed suit
against 80 Defendants alleging 15 causes of action related to COVID-19
mandates.
 
            Now,
specially appearing Doe Defendant Kristin Crowley (Defendant Crowley) moves to
quash service of summons.  
 
Discussion 
 
            Defendant
Crowley, the Fire Chief of LAFD as of 3/25/2022 argues that service upon her
was defective because Plaintiffs failed to personally serve her by personal
service. 
 
"Personal
Service" has been defined as the actual delivery of the papers to the
defendant in person. (See Sternbeck v. Buck (1957) 148 Cal.App.2d
829, 832.) Service of a summons in the manner of personal delivery to the
person to be served is deemed complete at the time of such delivery. (See
CCP § 415.10.)
 
Here, Crowley
submitted evidence of Ring video footage that suggests that Defendant Crowley
was not the individual who received service at her home. (See Crowley
Decl.) As such, Plaintiffs' service of summons and the SAC on April 30, 2023 would
not satisfy the statutory requirements of CCP section 415.10.
 
Plaintiffs’
service also would not satisfy the requirements of substitute service. CCP
section 415.20 authorizes substitute service of process in lieu of personal
delivery by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint at the person's
dwelling in the presence of a competent member of the household. However, for
substitute service to be valid, a copy of the summons and of the complaint must
be mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid to the person to be served at
the place where the copy of the summons and complaint were left. Defendant
Crowley claims that she never received any additional copies of the summons and
SAC by first-class mail at her residence after April 30, 2023. (See Decl.
of Kristin Crowley ¶ 21.) Plaintiffs also did not submit any supporting
declaration of diligence to justify substitute service. 
 
However, the
Court need not even determine whether or not Crowley was personally served,
because Plaintiff did not comply with California Rules of Court, Rule 3.110(b).
 
California
Rules of Court, Rule 3.110(b) states in part when the complaint is amended to
add a defendant, the added defendant must be served and proof of service must
be filed within 30 days after the filing of the amended complaint.
 
Plaintiffs
filed their SAC on January 17, 2023 alleging several causes of action
specifically against Kristin Crowley. (See SAC.) On April 20, 2023,
Plaintiffs electronically filed an Amendment to Complaint (Fictitious
/Incorrect Name) for Fire Chief Kristin Crowley as DOE Defendant 2. (See
RJN, Amendment to Complaint of DOE Defendant 2.) Plaintiffs subsequently filed
a Proof of Service of Summons connected to Kristin Crowley on August 22, 2023.
This indicates a lack of compliance with CRC Rule 3.110(b). Plaintiffs also
failed to seek an application for modification of these requirements from the
Court. (See CRC Rule 3.110(e).)
 
As noted by
Defendant’s reply, Plaintiff failed to even address this argument in
opposition, and the Court considered this concession on the merits. 
 
Based on the
foregoing, Defendant Crowley’s motion to quash service of summons is granted. The
Court declines to award sanctions at this time for non-compliance with CRC Rule
3.110(b). 
 
It is so ordered.

Defendant Aram
Salmasi’s motion to quash service of summons is GRANTED.
 
On
12/13/2021, Freedom to Choose L.A. and 4,499 other Plaintiffs filed suit
against 80 Defendants alleging 15 causes of action related to COVID-19 mandates.
 
            Now,
specially appearing Doe Defendant Aram Salmasi (Defendant Salmasi) moves to
quash service of summons.  
 
Discussion 
 
            Defendant
Salmasi argues that personal service upon him was defective because he did not
authorize City employee Yalitza Toeldo to accept personal service on his
behalf. 
 
"Personal
Service" has been defined as the actual delivery of the papers to the
defendant in person. (See Sternbeck v. Buck (1957) 148 Cal.App.2d
829, 832.) Service of a summons in the manner of personal delivery to the
person to be served is deemed complete at the time of such delivery. (See
CCP § 415.10.)
 
            Here,
the Proof of Service of Summons indicates that the process server delivered the
Summons to a person by the name of “Yalitza Toledo.” Defendant Salmasi was not
the person who received the summons and SAC from the process server on May 4,
2023. 
 
            Defendant
Salmasi submitted evidence to show that Yalitza Toledo was not an authorized
agent to accept service on his behalf: 
 
-        
Yalitza Toledo and 6 Defendant Salmasi
were assigned to different City departments on May 4, 2023. (Salmasi Decl. ¶
¶  8-9.) Ms. Toledo was assigned to the
Department of General Services of the City of Los Angeles on May 4, 2023.
(Salmasi Decl. ¶ 10.) At that time, Defendant Salmasi was assigned to the
Housing Department, Community Investment Department for Families, and the Youth
Development Department of the City of Los Angeles. (Salmasi Decl. ¶ 11.) 
 
-        
Defendant Salmasi never provided any
verbal or written authorization for her to accept any legal documents on his
behalf. Defendant Salmasi previously worked with Yalitza Toledo when he had
been to the Department of General Services, but he last worked in the
Department of General Services on December 2, 2022. (Salmasi Decl. ¶¶ 13-15.)
 
-        
Yalitza Toledo did not provide the
Summons and SAC to Defendant Salmasi on May 4, 2023 or anytime thereafter.
Defendant Salmasi learned that he had been named as a defendant in the
above-entitled action from his manager Gina Tervalon. He also never received
any copies of the Summons and SAC by first-class mail, postage prepaid from the
Plaintiffs attorney or anyone else. (Salmasi Decl. ¶¶ 17-19.)
 
The Court
agrees this evidence shows defective service on Defendant Salmasi by a
preponderance of the evidence.
 
Moreover,
California Rules of Court, Rule 3.110(b) states in part when the complaint is
amended to add a defendant, the added defendant must be served and proof of
service must be filed within 30 days after the filing of the amended complaint.
 
Plaintiffs
filed their SAC on January 17, 2023 alleging several causes of action
specifically against Aram Salmasi. (See SAC.) On April 20, 2023, Plaintiffs
electronically filed an Amendment to Complaint (Fictitious /Incorrect Name) for
Aram Salmasi as DOE Defendant 2. (See RJN, Amendment to Complaint of DOE
Defendant 2.) Plaintiffs subsequently filed a Proof of Service of Summons
connected to Aram Salmasi on August 22, 2023. This indicates a lack of
compliance with CRC Rule 3.1110(b). Plaintiffs also failed to seek an
application for modification of these requirements from the Court. (See CRC
Rule 3.110(e).)
 
As noted by
Defendant’s reply, Plaintiff failed to even address this argument in
opposition, and the Court considered this concession on the merits. 
 
Based on the
foregoing, Defendant Salmasi’s motion to quash service of summons is granted. 
 
It is so ordered.
