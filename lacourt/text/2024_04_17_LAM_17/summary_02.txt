The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash service of summons filed by Defendants Kristin Crowley and Aram Salmasi. The Plaintiffs, Freedom to Choose L.A., filed a lawsuit against 80 Defendants alleging 15 causes of action related to COVID-19 mandates. The Judge found that the service of summons on both Defendants was defective. In the case of Defendant Crowley, the Judge found that the Plaintiffs failed to personally serve her, and instead, served her through a substitute service that did not comply with the California Rules of Court. In the case of Defendant Salmasi, the Judge found that the process server did not have authorization to accept service on his behalf. The Judge granted both motions to quash service of summons and declined to award sanctions at this time for non-compliance with the California Rules of Court.
