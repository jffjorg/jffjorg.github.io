DEBRA MOUTON 
  
        
  vs.
 
GENERAL MOTORS
  LLC, et al. 
 


 Case
  No.:  21STCV27685
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  April 17, 2024



 
            
Plaintiff is
awarded $26,702.50 in attorney
fees (Quill is awarded $17,932.50 in reasonable attorney fees, and WPL is
awarded $8,770). Plaintiff did not submit a verified memorandum of costs, and
thus the Court does not consider a cost award at this time.  
 
            On
7/28/2024, Plaintiff Debra Mouton filed suit against General Motors, LLC
alleging violations of the Song-Beverly Act. 
 
            Now,
Plaintiff moves for attorney fees totaling $90,754.78.
 
Legal Standard 
 
The party
claiming attorneys’ fees must establish entitlement to such fees and the
reasonableness of the fees claimed.  (Civic Western Corporation v. Zila Industries,
Inc. (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 1, 16.) “Except as attorney’s fees are
specifically provided for by statute, the measure and mode of compensation of
attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement, express or implied,
of the parties[.]” (CCP § 1021.)
 
“It is well
established that the determination of what constitutes reasonable attorney fees
is committed to the discretion of the trial court, whose decision cannot be
reversed in the absence of an abuse of discretion.”  (Melnyk
v. Robledo (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618, 623.) 
In exercising its discretion, the court should
consider a number of factors, including the nature of the litigation, its
difficulty, the amount involved, the skill required in handling the matter, the
attention given, the success or failure, and the resulting judgment.  (Ibid.) 
 
In
determining what constitutes a reasonable compensation for an attorney who has
rendered services in connection with a legal proceeding, the court may and
should consider the nature of the litigation, its difficulty, the amount
involved, the skill required and the skill employed in handling the litigation,
the attention given, the success of the attorneys’ efforts, their learning,
their age, and their experience in the particular type of work demanded the
intricacies and importance of the litigation, the labor and necessity for
skilled legal training and ability in trying the cause, and the time consumed.
(Stokus v. Marsh (1990) 217
Cal.App.3d 647, 657 (Stokus).) 
 
In
determining the proper amount of fees to award, courts use the lodestar
method.  The lodestar figure is
calculated by multiplying the total number of reasonable hours expended by the
reasonable hourly rate.  “Fundamental to
its determination … [is] a careful compilation of the time spent and reasonable
hourly compensation of each attorney … in the presentation of the case.”  (Serrano
v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 48 (Serrano
III).)  A reasonable hourly rate must
reflect the skill and experience of the attorney.  (Id.
at 49.)  “Prevailing parties
are compensated for hours reasonably spent on fee-related issues.  A fee request that appears unreasonably
inflated is a special circumstance permitting the trial court to reduce the
award or deny one altogether.”  (Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621,
635 (Serrano IV); see also Weber v. Langholz (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th
1578, 1587 (“The trial court could make its own evaluation of the reasonable
worth of the work done in light of the nature of the case, and of the
credibility of counsel’s declaration unsubstantiated by time records and
billing statements.”)
 
Reasonable
attorney fees should be based on an objective standard of reasonableness, i.e.,
the market value of services rendered, not on some notion of cost incurred. (PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22
Cal.4th 1084, 1090.)  The value of legal
services performed in a case is a matter in which the trial court has its own
expertise.  (Id. at 1096.)  The trial
court may make its own determination of the value of the services contrary to,
or without the necessity for, expert testimony. 
(Ibid.)  The trial
court makes its determination after consideration of a number of factors,
including the nature of the litigation, its difficulty, the amount involved,
the skill required in its handling, the skill employed, the attention given,
the success or failure, and other circumstances in the case.  (Ibid.)
 
Timeliness 
 
Under
California Rule of Court 3.1702, a fee motion “must be served and filed within
the time for filing a notice of appeal under Rules 8.104 and 8.108 in an
unlimited civil case . . . .” (Rule 3.1702(b)(1).) Under Rule 8.104(a)(1), the
“deadline ordinarily falls 60 days after notice of entry of judgment, or 180
days after entry of judgment, whichever is first.” (Kaufman v. Diskeeper
Corp. (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 1, 8.) “The language of the rule thus applies
only to a motion to recover all prejudgment attorney fees incurred in an
action, and contemplates the filing of such a motion at the conclusion of the
lawsuit.” (Carpenter v. Jack in the Box Corp. (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th
454, 463.) 
 
There is a
long history of caselaw pointing toward settlements serving as “judgments.” (See
DeSaulles v. Community Hospital of Monterey Peninsula (2016) 62 Cal.4th
1140, 1155 [“As between the parties thereto and for purposes of enforcement of
settlement agreements, a compromise agreement contemplating payment by
defendant and dismissal of the action by plaintiff is the legal equivalent of a
judgment in plaintiff’s favor.”] italics added, citing (Goodstein v. Bank of
San Pedro (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 899, 907 907, italics added; see also
Madrigal v. Hyundai Motor America (2023) 90 Cal.App.5th 385, 399-403).)
 
Here, rather
than take any action after accepting GM’s 998 on June 12, 2023,
Quill and Arrow (Quill or QA); and West Point Legal (WPL) waited more than
eight months – 261 days to be exact – before filing its fee motion. Such a
delay goes entirely unexplained, as Quill and WPL do not address the delay in
its opening brief, nor do they offer any explanation for it. 
 
In reply,
Plaintiff’s counsel still offers no justification. However, they note that the
998 states that “Plaintiff will file a Request for Dismissal of the entire
action, with prejudice, within five business days after receiving all payments
from GM due Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel.” As such, according to the terms
of GM’s § 998, judgement is not entered until the matter is dismissed with
prejudice, and that cannot occur until all payments have been received, of
which reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses are a part. 
 
Thus, while
the Court finds Plaintiff’s eighth month delay to be unreasonable, the Court
declines to rule as a matter of law that Plaintiff has lost its ability to
recover attorney fees. 
 
Accordingly,
the Court turns to the substance of the motion.
 
Discussion 
 
Plaintiff
seeks attorney fees totally $90,754.78. This amount consists of (1) $31,771.00
in attorney fees for Quill & Arrow; (2) $28,455.00 in attorney fees for
West Point Legal; (3) a 1.35 multiplier enhancement on the attorney fees (or
$21,079.10); (4) $3,326.98 in costs incurred by QA; (5) $122.70 in costs
incurred by WPL; and (6) an additional $6,000 for Plaintiff’s counsel to review
Defendant’s Opposition; draft the Reply; and attend the hearing on this Motion.
 
Plaintiffs’
counsel claims the following hourly rates for the attorneys who worked on this
case: 
 
-        
Brian Altman: $950/hr
-        
Kevin Jacobson: $500/hr 
-        
Gregory Sogoyan: $500/hr
-        
Harry Terzian: $350/hr
-        
Nicholas Yowarski: 2021 rate of
$350/hour, 2022 rate of $375/hour, and 2023 rate of $395/hour
-        
Rebecca Yousefian: $385.00/hour
-        
Kim Anglin: $400/hr
 
In Morris
v. Hyundai Motor Am. (2019) 41 Cal. App. 5th 24, 41, the trial court
reduced the rates of Bryan Altman of the Altman Law Group, who has 30-plus years
of litigation experience with over 100 jury trials, of which 20-plus were as
lead trial counsel in lemon law cases, from $650 to $500 per hour, reduced
Steve Mikhov of the Knight Law Group from $500 to $400, and reduced all the
associates’ rates that ranged from $450 to $350 to $300 per hour. (Id. at 8-9.)
In support of the lower court decision, the court of appeal held that:
 
[E]ven if
Morris established that her attorneys’ rates were generally commensurate with
other consumer law attorneys with the same level of experience and skill,
Morris ignores that there are a number of factors that the trial court may have
taken into consideration in determining that reductions in the attorneys’
hourly rates were warranted. The court reasonably could have reduced the rates
based on its finding that the matter was not complex; that it did not go to
trial; that the name partners were doing work that could have been done by
lower-billing attorneys; and that all the attorneys were doing work that could
have been done by paralegals.
 
            (Id.
at pp. 23-24.)
 
            Similarly,
Judge Randolph Hammock of the Los Angeles County Superior Court recently found
rates of $350 per hour appropriate for an “experienced” lawyer to take a lemon
law case all the way through trial. (See Mikhaeilpoor v. BMW of N. Am., LLC
(2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 240, 245-46 [“The court found the requested fee amount
“was just not reasonable.”… The court decided that $350 “is a reasonable hourly
rate for the services that were done.”].)
 
            Here,
the Court finds the hourly rates to be unreasonable, and, based on case law,
reduces the hourly rates for each of plaintiffs’ attorneys to a reasonable
blended $400 per hour for all attorneys who litigated this case, consistent
with Mikhaeilpoor. This informed by the fact that this case did not
address novel or difficult questions, was straightforward and simple, did not
go to trial, and involved work that could have been done by lower-billing
attorneys. 
 
Hours
 
            Plaintiff’s
counsel claims a total of 128.7 1 hours. However, as detailed in Defendant’s
opposition, the billing records indicate duplicative and inflated billings. For
example, counsel claims 1 hr drafting templated discovery requests. A
substantial portion of the billings are for “review.” For example, Mr. Yowarski
“billed” 0.6 hours ($210.00) to review the repair orders and draft a repair
order summary. (Jacobson Decl., Ex. 8, pp. 3-4.) Ms. Anglin later “billed” 0.5
hours ($200.00) to review additional client documents and update the repair
order summary. A more thorough outline of the unreasonable and duplicative
billings is set forth in Defendant’s opposition. (See pp. 12- 16.)  
                                                
            The
Court finds that Quill is claiming 43.5 hours not reasonably incurred, and WPL
is claiming 47.5 hours not reasonably incurred. After adjustment, Quill is
awarded $17,932.50 in reasonable attorney fees, and WPL is awarded $8,770 in
reasonable attorney fees. 
 
The Court
declines to award a multiplier. The hourly rates set forth above capture the
skill and the contingent nature. Thus, any multiplier would be duplicative of
the calculations set forth above. Furthermore, an analysis of the relevant
factors do not justify an enhancement award. 
 
            Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiff is awarded $26,702.50 in attorney fees. Plaintiff did not submit a verified
memorandum of costs, and Defendant objected to the costs in opposition.
Accordingly, the Court does not consider a cost award at this time.  
 
It is so ordered.
