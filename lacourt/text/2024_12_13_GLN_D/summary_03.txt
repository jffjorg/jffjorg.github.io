Significant Statements:
  - "The points concerning service are directed to the prior complaint, so that if the FAC is in fact filed, the motion to quash would be rendered moot."
  - "The filing, if the amendments are as to matters of substance and not mere matters of form, would also open up the defaults, and the amended pleading would be required to be served on the defaulted defendants by the same means as service of summons."
  - "The court has reviewed the pleadings, and finds that the amendments include those as to matters of substance, and notes that the opposition appears to concede the amendments involve matters of substance and require entirely new service by arguing in the opposition that the defaults would be ineffective and service requirements would begin anew."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case between Bakman Residence, LLC, and 4181 Bakman Avenue, LLC, and others. The defendants have filed a demurrer to the plaintiffs' complaint and a motion to quash service of summons. The plaintiffs have filed an opposition to the motion to quash, arguing that the motion is moot because they have filed a first amended complaint that supersedes the original complaint.

The judge agrees that the motion to quash is directed to the original complaint, which is superseded by the filing of the first amended complaint. The judge also finds that the demurrer is moot because the first amended complaint includes new allegations that require service in a new manner.

The judge notes that the defendants' motion to set aside default and default judgment is also moot because the first amended complaint opens up the defaults and requires service in the manner of service of summons. The judge reminds the parties of their obligations to meet and confer again before filing a demurrer to the amended pleading.

The judge's tentative ruling is that the defendants' motion to set aside default and default judgment, and the demurrer, are moot and taken off calendar. The case is continuing to conduct and encourage audio or video appearances, and the parties are reminded of their obligations to make arrangements in advance if they wish to appear remotely.
