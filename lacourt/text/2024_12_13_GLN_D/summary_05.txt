And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by defendants Nima Etemadian and Elavate Pasadena, LLC. The demurrer argues that the complaint fails to state a cause of action for breach of contract, is uncertain, and is barred by the statute of limitations. The motion to strike seeks to strike certain allegations as false and contrary to the lease agreement.

The judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the complaint adequately alleges each element of a breach of contract, including the lease agreement, plaintiff's performance, defendant's breach, and resulting damages. The judge also found that the complaint is not uncertain, despite some minor inconsistencies, and that the statute of limitations defense is not supported by the facts.

The judge has denied the motion to strike, finding that the allegations are not false and that the complaint adequately alleges each element of the breach of contract claim. The judge has also denied the motion to strike the claims for late fees and interest, finding that such calculations are not required at the pleading stage.

The judge has ordered the defendants to answer the complaint within 10 days. The judge has also encouraged the parties to use LACourtConnect for remote appearances.
