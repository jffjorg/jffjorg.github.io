Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiff, Arpik Keshishyan, by granting her motion to compel defendant Sophia Aftandelian to serve verified responses to interrogatories. The defendant failed to serve timely responses, which waived her right to object to the interrogatories. The plaintiff is seeking $2,560 in sanctions, but the court has awarded a reduced amount of $1,500. The defendant is ordered to serve the responses within ten days. The judge has also ordered the plaintiff's attorney to prepare an order for sanctions and submit it to the court.
