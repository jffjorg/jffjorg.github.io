And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a dispute between the plaintiff (Petitioner) and the defendant (Respondent) regarding a request for pre-judgment interest at the administrative level. The Respondent argues that the Petitioner waived or failed to exhaust administrative remedies, but the judge rejects this argument. The judge notes that the discipline related to each Deputy Doe was overturned on review and that the Respondent was afforded a full and fair opportunity to litigate the request for pre-judgment interest. The judge also rejects the Respondent's argument that the Petitioner's request for pre-judgment interest was functionally equivalent to a request to be "made whole" for the loss of wages and employee benefits. The judge concludes that the Petitioner's request for pre-judgment interest is not waived or failed to exhaust administrative remedies.
