 Case Number:  23STCP02365    Hearing Date:   October 25, 2023    Dept:  86 COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT THE RECALL OF DISTRICT
ATTORNEY GEORGE GASCON v. LOGAN
Case Number: 23STCP02365
Hearing Date: October 25, 2023 
 
 
[Tentative]       ORDER
GRANTING MOTION TO STRIKE IN PART
 
 
 
Respondents, Dean C. Logan, in his official
capacity as the Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk (Registrar),
and the Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk (collectively, Respondents)
move to strike portions of the first amended petition for writ of mandate (FAP)
filed by Petitioner, Committee to Support the Recall of District Attorney
George Gascon.  Real Party in Interest,
George Gascon, joins in the motion.  
 
The motion is granted in part.
 
Respondents’ request for judicial notice (RJN) of
Exhibits A and B is granted. The court judicially notices the existence of
these official records but not the truth of any factual or hearsay statements
made therein. (See Love v. Wolf (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 378, 403; Garcia
v. Sterling (1985) 176 Cal. App. 3d 17, 22.)
 
Respondents’ RJN of Exhibit C is also granted.
 
RELEVANT PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
On July 28, 2023, Petitioner filed its FAP. Petitioner
alleges Registrar unlawfully rejected a petition to recall Gascon (the Recall
Petition) from his elected position as the District Attorney for Los Angeles
County. Respondents, joined by Gascon, move to strike various allegations in
the FAP.
 
STANDARD OF REVIEW 
 
Upon
motion, the court may “strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter
inserted in any pleading” or “[s]trike out all or any part of any pleading not
drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an
order of the court.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 436.) As with a demurrer, “[t]he
grounds for a motion to strike shall appear on the face of the challenged
pleading or from any matter of which the court is required to take judicial
notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437.) Accordingly, a motion to strike is “not the
appropriate procedure for determining the truth of disputed facts.” (Fremont
Indemnity Co. v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 113-114.)[1]  
 
Courts
take a “cautious” approach to motions to strike; they “have no intention of
creating a procedural ‘line item veto’ for the civil defendant.” (PH II,
Inc. v. Superior Court (1995) 33 Cal. App. 4th 1680, 1683.) “Judges read
allegations of a pleading subject to a motion to strike as a whole, all parts
in their context, and assume their truth.” (Clauson v. Superior Court (1998)
67 Cal.App.4th 1253, 1255.)
 
ANALYSIS 
 
Registrar’s Calculation of the “Number of
Registered Voters” Pursuant to Elections Code Section 11221
 
“[U]nder
Elections Code[2]
section 11221, the Recall Petition needed to be signed by not less than 10% of
the registered voters in the electoral jurisdiction . . . .” (FAP ¶ 27; § 11221,
subd. (a).) Registrar informed Petitioner “ ‘[t]he number of registered voters
shall be calculated as of the time of the last report of registration to the
Secretary of State, which was January 4, 
2022,’
” and “Registrar attached the Secretary of State’s report of registration for
Los Angeles County as of that date, purportedly showing 5,668,569 active
registered voters.” (FAP ¶ 27, Exh. 1.) Thus, “Registrar informed the Committee that ‘[t]he number of valid signatures
required for the [Recall Petition] will be 566,857.’ ” (FAP
¶ 27, Exh. 1.)  
 
Petitioner
alleges Registrar inaccurately advised it 566,857 valid signatures were needed
for the Recall Petition. Petitioner explains, “Registrar confirmed that as of
December 31, 2021—four days before the Registrar certified its voter
registration numbers to the Secretary of State—Los Angeles County had a mere
5,438,400 active registered voters, or 230,169 fewer than it reported to the
Secretary of State.” (FAP ¶ 27(a), Exh. 6.) Petitioner also alleges, after
reviewing a spreadsheet provided by Registrar of “active registered voters,”
Petitioner has “determined that approximately 35,015 persons identified as
active registered voters should not have been so identified for various
reasons.” (FAP ¶ 28(b).) As noted, for purposes of this motion to strike, the
court is required to assume the truth of Petitioner’s factual allegations.
 
As
a result of Registrar’s alleged errors in the calculation of the number of
registered voters in Los Angeles County, Petitioner contends “the Recall
Petition should have qualified for a recall election as long as it was
supported by 540,338 signatures—which was 26,518 fewer than what the Registrar
claimed was required.” (FAP ¶ 29.)  
 
Petitioner’s
allegations are important because Registrar found 520,050 of the 715,833 signatures submitted on the
Recall Petition were valid. (FAP ¶¶ 15-17.) If Petitioner’s allegations about
the number of active registered voters are correct, Petitioner would
need to identify only about 20,288 improperly rejected signatures to prevail in
this proceeding, as compared to Registrar’s claim of the 46,807. (FAP ¶
2.)  
 
Respondents move to strike the allegations
Registrar incorrectly calculated the number of registered voters pursuant to
section 11221. Respondents contend:
 
·       section 11221 requires the calculation of
registered voters for the number of signatures for a valid recall petition to
be based on “the last report of
registration by the county elections official to the Secretary of State”;
·       section
11301, which authorizes Petitioner to examine petition signatures, does not
contain a procedure to challenge Registrar’s calculation of the number of
registered voters pursuant to section 11221; and
·       requiring
Registrar to use a different number of registered voters would violate the relevant
statutory scheme and also undermine the integrity of public elections.  
 
Registrar’s
position raises questions of statutory interpretation. “The rules governing statutory
construction are well settled. We begin with the fundamental premise that the objective
of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent.
[Citations.] To determine legislative intent, we turn first to the words of the
statute, giving them their usual and ordinary meaning. [Citations.] When the
language of a statute is clear, we need go no further. However, when the
language is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation, we look to
a variety of extrinsic aids, including the ostensible objects to be achieved,
the evils to be remedied, the legislative history, public policy,
contemporaneous administrative construction, and the statutory scheme of which
the statute is a part.” (Nolan v. City of
Anaheim (2004) 33 Cal.4th 335, 340.)   
 
To the extent
“purely legal issues involve the interpretation of a statute an administrative
agency is responsible for enforcing, [the court] exercise[s] [its] independent
judgment, ‘taking into account and respecting the agency's interpretation of
its meaning.’ ” (Housing Partners I, Inc.
v. Duncan (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 1335, 1343; see also Yamaha Corp. of America v. State Bd. Of Equalization (1998) 19
Cal.4th 1, 11.)  
 
              Section 11221 and Related
Statutes 
 
The court
begins its statutory analysis with section 11221, which provides in relevant part:

 
The number of qualified
signatures required in order to qualify a recall for the ballot shall be as
follows:
 
(a) In the case of an officer of
a . . . county, . . . the number of signatures shall be equal in number to not
less than the following percent of the registered voters in the electoral
jurisdiction:
              .
. . .
(5)
Ten percent if the registration is 100,000 or above.
 
(b) For purposes of this section,
the number of registered voters shall be calculated as of the time of the
last report of registration by the county elections official to the Secretary
of State pursuant to Section 2187,[3]
and prior to the finding by the elections official or Secretary of State that
no alterations are required in the form of the recall petition pursuant
to Section
11042. (Emphasis added.)
 
Registrar
contends section 11221 requires an “objective,” mathematical calculation based
on the number of registered voters stated in the county’s most recent “report
of registration” pursuant to section 2187. (Memo 8:13-15.) Registrar’s interpretation
is reasonable.  
 
Section 11221,
subdivision (a) specifies the percentage of registered voters to be used to
determine the number of qualified signatures required to qualify a recall for
the ballot. Section 11221, subdivision (b) specifies the numerical calculation
should be performed “as of the time of the last report of registration.” 
 
Although the
statute could have been worded more clearly, it appears the Legislature
intended the calculation to be based on the number of registered voters stated in
the “last report of registration,” as specifically referenced in section 11221,
subdivision (b). If the Legislature had intended Registrar to use some other
source of information or to calculate the number of registered voters
differently, it presumably would have stated so explicitly. Instead, the
Legislature referred to the last report of registration, signaling an intent
for the calculation required by section 11221 to be based on the number of
registered voters in that report.
 
Petitioner
contends “section 11221(b) requires that the signature threshold number be
calculated ‘as of time’ of the last Report of Registration; it does not require
that the Registrar use the (erroneous) number in the Report or Registration.” (Opposition
10:11-14.) 
 
While the
statute does require the calculation to be performed “as of the time” of the
last report, the reference to the report strongly suggests the Legislature
intended Registrar to use the number of registered voters from the report. It
seems highly unlikely the Legislature would have referred to the report of
registration simply to affix a date for the calculation. If the Legislature did
not intend to use the estimate of registered voters from the report, it could
have simply specified a date for the calculation without reference to the
report. Thus, Petitioner’s interpretation of section 11221, subdivision (b)
renders the reference to the report of registration unnecessary. If the Legislature
merely intended to provide a relevant date, the Legislature could have referred
directly to section 2187—the dates reports of registration are to be provided
to the Secretary of State. (See § 2187, subd. (c).) “[I]nterpretations which render any part of a
statute superfluous are to be avoided.”  (Young v. McCoy (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th
1078, 1083.)  
 
Notably, the
Legislature did not specify any other method of calculating the total number of
registered voters or the source of information about registered voters for Registrar
to use for the calculation. Thus, Petitioner’s interpretation of section 11221,
subdivision (b) implies some subjective or discretionary procedure under which Registrar
would calculate the number of registered voters as of a date specified by the
Legislature through a method of determining the number of registered voters
selected by Registrar and without statutory guidelines.[4]
Under Petitioner’s interpretation, all 58 counties of the state could permissibly
employ different methods for calculating the number of registered voters in connection
with a recall petition. Petitioner’s interpretation leads to absurd results and
seems unworkable. (See People v. Jenkins (1995) 10 Cal.4th 234, 246 [courts seek to “avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd
consequences” when interpreting a statute or regulation].)  
 
Petitioner
also argues “the difference in language between section 11221(b) and other
similar statutes makes clear that this section does not require blind usage of
the number reported in the Report of Registration.” (Opposition 10:18-20.) Petitioner
cites two statutes from the Elections Code in support of its argument—sections
11220 and 9215. “Ordinarily, where the Legislature uses a different word or
phrase in one part of a statute than it does in other sections or in a similar
statute concerning a related subject, it must be presumed that the Legislature
intended a different meaning.” (Committee to Support Recall of Gascon v.
Logan (2023) 94 Cal.App.5th 352, 377.) In construing a statute, the court “may
neither insert language which has been omitted nor ignore language which has
been inserted.” (See People v. National
Auto. and Cas. Ins. Co. (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 277, 282.)  
 
Section 11220
is entitled “Time for filing,” immediately precedes 11221 and is part of the
same article in the Elections Code addressing recall petitions. Section 11220
states in relevant part: 
 
(a) A recall petition shall be submitted
to the elections official for filing in his or her office during normal office
hours as posted within the following number of days after the clerk or, in the
case of a recall of a state officer, the Secretary of State, notifies the
proponents that the form and wording of the petition meets the requirements of
Article 3 (commencing with Section 11040) of Chapter
1:
. . . .
 
(5) One hundred sixty days if the
electoral jurisdiction has 50,000 registered voters or more.
 
(b) For purposes of this section,
the number of registered voters shall be that which was reported at the last
report of registration by the county elections official to the Secretary of
State pursuant to Section 2187 . . . . (Emphasis added.)
 
Petitioner
correctly reports section 11220, subdivision (b) is worded a bit differently
than section 11221, subdivision (b). Section 12220, subdivision (b) also explicitly
instructs the number of registered voters “shall be” that “reported at the last
report of registration . . . .”  
 
While not particularly
helpful with a reconciliation of the statutes, Respondents note section 11220
and section 11221 have different purposes. Section 11221, subdivision (b) requires
a calculation of the percentage of registered voters—“an objective signature
threshold.” (Memo 8:15.) In contrast, section 11220, subdivision (b) concerns the
number of days a recall petition may be circulated based on the number of
registered voters “reported at the last report of registration.” Section 11220,
subdivision (b) does not require any numerical calculation—it specifies which
report of registration must be used.[5]
Given their different purposes, the Legislature’s use of a report of
registration in one statute does not necessarily dictate the interpretation of
the term in the other.
 
Importantly, “[a] statute must be construed ‘in the context of the entire
statutory system of which it is a part, in order to achieve harmony among the parts.’
” (People v. Hull (1991) 1 Cal. 4th 266,
272.) Sections 11220, subdivision (b) and 11221, subdivision (b) can be read in
harmony—the Legislature appears to have intended county election officials to
determine registered voters for both statutes based on the number of registered
voters as set forth in the “last report of registration.” The report of
registration is used to determine the number of days a recall petition may be
circulated as well as the percentage of the number of those registered
voters  for a valid recall petition.
 
In contrast,
Petitioner’s interpretation creates disharmony within the legislative scheme.
Petitioner’s interpretation of the statutes would require county election
officials to use the “last report of registration” to determine the number of
registered voters for one part of the statutory process (section 11220’s time
for filing) but not another (section 11221’s numerical calculation of qualified
signatures).  
 
Petitioner
also points out section 9215 uses different wording to refer to a 10 percent
calculation from a report of registration (“according to the last report of
registration”) than used in either sections 11220 or 11221. (Opposition 11:8-12.)
Section 9215 addresses the duties of local legislative bodies to determine when
ballot measures qualify for the ballot, not requirements related recall
petitions. The rule of statutory
construction Petitioner relies upon applies only when the Legislature uses different words “concerning a related
subject.” (Opposition 10:21-11:4.) Additionally, Petitioner’s reference to
section 9215 does not address the need to harmonize sections 11220, subdivision
(b) and 11221, subdivision (b).  
 
Based on the
foregoing, the court finds Respondents’ interpretation of section 11221 and
related statutes more convincing and more consistent with the plain statutory
language. To the extent there is ambiguity in section 11221, subdivision (b),
the “extrinsic aids” identified by the parties also weigh in support of Respondents’
interpretation. Specifically, in the Secretary of State’s analysis of Assembly
Bill 927 (Stats. 1982, Ch. 109), enacting the requirement that the number of
signatures on a recall petition be based on a percentage of registered voters,
the Secretary explains the bill “[w]ill specify which report of registration is
to be used when calculating the required number of signatures needed to qualify
a recall petition.” (RJN Exh. C at 73.) The analysis then specifies the report
of registration “is identical to that used for the purpose of determining the
number of days allowable for circulation of the recall petition.” (Ibid.)  Thus, the legislative history supports Respondents’
interpretation of section 11221, subdivision (b) and undermines Petitioner’s.
 
Petitioner argues
“[t]he Legislature’s decision to amend the statute was clearly about moving toward
accuracy, not away, given that the prior version of the statute would always
use an outdated number unrepresentative of the active voter base at the time of
the petition . . . .”  (Opposition 12:4-6.)
However, Petitioner does not reference any statements of the Legislature or
other legislative history in support of its interpretation. Further, even if the
Legislature intended to move “toward accuracy,” Petitioner fails to
explain how use of the number of registered voters from the election official’s
most recent report of registration would be inconsistent with that goal.  
 
Petitioner contends
“[s]tatutes and regulations pertaining to recall must be liberally construed in
favor of a recall petition.” (Opposition 8:14-15.) However, such a policy “does not allow the courts to enlarge
the scope of a procedural statute where the statutory provisions are clear.” (Hartman
v. Kenyon (1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 413, 420.) 
Moreover, while Petitioner’s construction of section 11221 happens to favor
its position in this proceeding, other recall proponents in other campaigns
might prefer the use of the report of registration number. Thus, the policy of
liberal construction does not support Petitioner’s interpretation of section
11221, subdivision (b) over that of Respondents.  
 
Finally, as argued by Respondents, public policy
considerations also weigh against Petitioner’s interpretation of section 11221,
subdivision (b). Specifically, Petitioner’s interpretation of section 11221,
subdivision (b), as well as section 11301 (see infra), “would jeopardize
the efficient finality of election decisions by inviting endless inquiries into
the Registrar’s process for determining signature thresholds based on
registered voter data, which are always in flux” and thereby “disrupt the
administration of recall elections.” (Memo 10:10-12, 24.)
 
Section 11301
and Related Statutes 
 
Relatedly, Respondents
argue section 11301, pursuant to which Petitioner is examining the
petition signatures (FAP ¶ 19), does not authorize or contain a procedure to
challenge Registrar’s calculation of the number of registered voters pursuant
to section 11221 and Registrar’s report of registration required by section 2187.
(Memo 9:7-13.)
 
Section 11301 states: 
 
If a petition is
found insufficient by the elections official or, in the case of the recall of a
state officer, the Secretary of State, the petition signatures may be examined
in accordance with Section Article 2 (commencing with Section 7924.100) of Chapter 2
of Part 5 of Division 10 of Title 1 of the Government Code.  
 
Presumably, if a county elections official failed to comply
with the ministerial duties set forth in sections 11220 or 11221, an injured
party could bring an action in ordinary mandate to enforce such duties. (See California Ass’n for Health Services at Home
v. Department of Health Services (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 696, 704. [“An
action in ordinary mandamus is proper where . . . the claim is that an agency
has failed to act as required by law.”]) To the extent the court interprets
section 11221, subdivision (b) as “an objective signature threshold” based on the
report of registration, section 2187 might then serve as a ministerial duty in ordinary
mandate. (Memo 8:15) Thus, it would likely be inaccurate—although the court need
not find so today—to suggest a county election official’s calculation of the “total
number of registered voters in the county” is beyond challenge. (§ 2187, subd.
(a)(1). See also Rakow v.
Swain (1960) 178
Cal.App.2d 895, 899.)
 
Nonetheless, Respondents
are correct—section 11301 contains no language suggesting the Legislature
intended to enable recall petitioners to challenge the “total number of voters
in the county” based on extrinsic evidence, as Petitioner seeks to do in the
FAP. (§ 2187, subd. (a)(1).) Petitioner asserts Respondents “give[] no cogent
reason why the Committee should be precluded from challenging the threshold
number—an integral part of qualify the recall petition—along with its challenge
to the wrongly rejected signatures.” (Opposition 12:9-11.)
 
First, the
court interprets the statutes as written by the Legislature. Petitioner has
identified no statute within Division 11, Chapter 3 of the Elections Code—governing
recall of elected local officers—authorizing a challenge to the number of
registered voters in the county as reported by a county elections official pursuant
to section 2187 by way of extrinsic evidence. 
 
Second,
Respondents have identified important policy reasons undermining Petitioner’s proffered
interpretation of sections 11221 and 11301. (See Memo 9:21-10:19; Reply 5:4-7.)
 
The court
agrees with Respondents that Petitioner’s reliance on Rakow v. Swain, supra, 178 Cal.App.2d at 895 is
misplaced because the court did not interpret sections 11220, 11221 or 11301.
Moreover, the factual circumstances in Rakow v. Swain were not comparable
to those alleged in the FAP.[6] “ ‘It is axiomatic that
language in a judicial opinion is to be understood in accordance with the
facts and issues before the court. An opinion is not authority
for propositions not considered.’ ” (People v. Knoller (2007)
41 Cal.4th 139, 154-55.)
 
Based on the foregoing,
the court finds section 11221, subdivision (b) requires Registrar to calculate
the number of valid signatures to qualify the Recall Petition for the ballot “as of the time of the last report of registration by [Registrar]
to the Secretary of State pursuant to Section 2187” and based on the number of registered
voters set forth in that same report.  
 
Petitioner does not allege Registrar
failed to calculate the number of necessary signatures as required by or
inconsistent with the controlling statute. (See FAP ¶ 2(a), 14, 24-29 and Exh.
1.)  
 
Accordingly, Petitioner’s allegations seeking
to overturn Registrar’s calculation of the number of qualified signatures
required to qualify the Recall Petition for the ballot based on the number of
registered voters are “irrelevant, false, or improper” and subject to this motion to strike.  
 
The motion is GRANTED IN PART, as set
forth in the Conclusion section below.
 
///
 
Petitioner Sufficiently Alleges Its Due
Process and Equal Protection Claims
 
In the FAP at paragraph 23(a), Petitioner
alleges the signatures rejected by Registrar due to deficiencies in the
signers’ written signatures must be counted as valid because the lack of a
signature cure process—whereby elections officials provide petition signers “an
opportunity to submit a valid signature”—violates due process and equal
protection. (FAP ¶ 23(a).) Petitioner alleges “the California Legislature
currently has pending before it proposed legislation that would give petition
signers the right to cure any deficiencies in their signature.” (FAP ¶ 23(a).) Petitioner
also alleges “all Recall Petition
signatures rejected on the basis of a deficiency with the signature itself—a
total of 11,681—should thus be counted.” (FAP
¶ 23(a).)   
 
“[D]ue process is a flexible concept that
requires protections appropriate to the particular situation.” (Rondon v. Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals
Bd. (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 1274, 1284.) A litigant asserting a deprivation
of due process generally must show “(1) a deprivation of a constitutionally
protected liberty or property interest, and (2) a denial of adequate procedural
protections.” (Franceschi v. Yee (9th Cir. 2018) 887 F.3d 927,
935.)  
 
Under well-established United States Supreme
Court precedent, “identification of the specific dictates of due process generally
requires consideration of three distinct factors: First, the private interest
that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous
deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable
value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally,
the Government's interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and
administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement
would entail.” (Mathews v. Eldridge (1976) 424 U.S. 319, 335.)
 
Respondents generally discuss private and
public interests relevant to “the lack of
a signature cure process” alleged in the FAP at paragraph 23(a) in their motion
to strike. (See Memo 13.)  However, Respondents
do not provide a complete analysis of the factors identified in Mathews v
Eldridge. Respondents also do not explain whether Petitioner’s allegations
in the FAP at paragraph 23(a) should be construed as a facial challenge to a
specific elections procedure, an as-applied challenge based on the facts of
this case, or both. The distinction is significant given that the FAP alleges
certain factual issues at paragraph 23(b) (discussed below), that cannot
be resolved through a motion to strike. Accordingly, Respondent has not met its
burden here to show paragraph 23(a) of the FAP should be stricken. Of course, Respondents may further develop these
issues in subsequent proceedings in this proceeding.  
 
Respondents also contend the Ninth
Circuit already “rejected” the due process and equal protection claims alleged
in the FAP at paragraph 23(a) in Lemons v. Bradbury (9th Cir. 2008) 538
F.3d 1098. (Memo12:12-13.) While there are similarities between the recall
procedures here and the Oregon state elections laws at issue in Lemons v.
Bradbury, there are also potentially important differences. Thus, as argued
by Petitioner, “the contested procedure
in Lemons allowed the public to object to determinations and enforced
multiple layers of review.”  (Opposition
14:17-19; see Lemons v. Bradbury, supra, 538 F.3d at 1104.) By contrast,
Petitioner alleges here “Registrar
failed to conduct all required levels of review for signatures that were
invalidated for having a mismatched signature” as required by California Code
of Regulations (CCR), title 2, section 20960 [Regulation 20960], subdivision (j).
(FAP ¶ 23(b).)  
 
While Respondents defend the “lack of a
signature cure process” based on alleged procedural safeguards created through Regulation
20960 (Memo 13:15-17), the FAP raises a factual question about whether Registrar
followed those procedural safeguards here. The court cannot resolve a factual
issue in ruling on a motion to strike. For these reasons, Respondents do not
show the FAP at paragraph 23(a) is “irrelevant,
false, or improper” and subject to
motion to strike as a matter of law.[7]  
 
Accordingly, the motion to strike the FAP
at paragraph 23(a) and related allegations is DENIED.
 
Petitioner Sufficiently Alleges Registrar
Failed Conduct “All Required Levels of Review” 

 
In the FAP at paragraph 23(b), Petitioner
alleges:
 
Upon information and belief, the Registrar failed to conduct all
required levels of review for signatures that were invalidated for having a
mismatched signature. A petition signature rejected as materially different
from the signature in the voter’s registration file must be confirmed by the
original examiner and two reviewers. ([Regulation 20960, subdivision (j)].)
Based on the Committee’s review of the Recall Petition, at least 2,425 such
rejected signatures were not subject to all three levels of review. Because a
petition signature must be counted unless the signature mismatch is confirmed
at all three levels of review (ibid.), these signatures must be counted.
(FAP ¶ 23(b).)
 
Regulation 20960 provides, in relevant
part: 
 
(c) The
comparison of a signature shall begin with the basic presumption that the
signature on the petition, the vote-by-mail identification envelope, signature
verification statement, unsigned ballot statement, or provisional ballot
envelope is the voter's signature.
 
(d) Exact
matches are not required for an elections official to confirm a valid
signature. The fact that signatures share similar characteristics is sufficient
to determine that a signature is valid.
              . . . .
 
(j) A signature that the initial
reviewer identifies as possessing multiple, significant, and obvious
distinctive differing characteristics from the signature(s) in the voter's
registration record shall only be rejected if two different elections officials
unanimously find beyond a reasonable doubt that the signature differs in
multiple, significant, and obvious respects from all signatures in the voter's
registration record.
 
In their motion to strike, Respondents contend “[e]ven
if the Registrar had failed to comply with this regulation, the Committee’s
conclusion that these signatures therefore ‘must be counted’ is wrong.” (Memo
14:21-22.) Respondent’s argument is overbroad. Setting aside the issue of
remedy alleged in the last sentence of the FAP at paragraph 23(b), the
remaining allegations in paragraph 23(b) have some factual relevance to Petitioner’s
due process and equal protection claims, as well as to Petitioner’s general
allegation Registrar improperly reviewed and rejected certain petition signatures.
Those relevant factual allegations are not subject to motion to strike.
 
As to the remedy asserted in the FAP in the last sentence of
paragraph 23(b), the court agrees with Respondents—even if Petitioner demonstrated
Registrar’s failure to comply with the procedural requirements of
Regulation 20960, nothing suggests the signatures invalidated because of an improper
procedure should be “counted” as valid petition signatures. An appropriate
remedy may result in requiring Registrar to conduct further review, something akin
to a remand to the agency.
 
Nonetheless, the issue of remedy is inherently tied to the
factual allegations of the FAP in paragraph 23(b) that Registrar failed to
conduct the review required by Regulation 20960. In this equitable proceeding, the
court may need to consider the specific factual circumstances proven at trial
in fashioning an appropriate remedy, including the reasonableness of
Registrar’s review of particular signatures. (See Mapstead v. Anchundo (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 246, 269, fn. 15.) 
 
Accordingly, the motion to strike the FAP at paragraph 23(b)
and related allegations is DENIED.
 
Leave to Amend
 
A motion to strike may be granted without leave to amend when there is no reasonable
possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment. (See Blank v. Kirwan
(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) Courts generally allow at least one time to
amend a complaint after sustaining a demurrer or granting a motion to strike. (See
McDonald v. Superior Court (1986) 180
Cal.App.3d 297, 303.)  In assessing
whether leave to amend should be granted, the burden is on the complainant to
show the court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Goodman v. 
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348-349.)  
 
Petitioner requests leave to amend, but
it does not explain how the defects discussed above could be cured by
amendment. (Opposition 15:25-16:2.) The defects discussed above center on the
proper interpretation of section 11221, subdivision (b)—a legal question subject
to decision on a motion to strike.  
Petitioner should address whether—given the
court’s interpretation of section 11221, subdivision (b)—there is a reasonable
possibility it can amend the FAP to cure the defects.
