And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the petition for writ of mandate filed by Daniel Olmos, seeking to set aside a decision finding him guilty of misconduct and dismissing him from his position as a Correctional Sergeant with the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. The court found that Olmos failed to file an opening brief or administrative record in support of his petition, which constitutes a waiver of his claims. Additionally, the court determined that Olmos has not met his burden of proof in the mandamus proceeding, citing the presumption that official duty has been regularly performed. The court also noted that Olmos failed to comply with the briefing schedule and did not serve and file a supporting memorandum as required.
