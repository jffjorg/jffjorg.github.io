TENTATIVE RULING


Doe Archdiocese and Doe 4 Parish’s request for judicial notice id granted
in full.  The documents are court
records.  The Court will judicially
notice the documents’ existence.
 
Doe Archdiocese and
Doe 4 Parish’s demurrer is sustained.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This case (30-2020-01174722-CU-PO-CJC) is part of the coordinated Southern
California Clergy Cases (JCCP 5101). 
Siler claims priests sexually abused him when he was a minor.  He alleges that Doe Archdiocese, Doe 4
Parish, and other Defendants failed to protect from the alleged abuse despite
having actual or constructive knowledge of the priests’ pedophilia.
 
Here, Doe Archdiocese and Doe 4 Parish demur to Siler’s second amended
adopted master complaint.
 
LAW
 
When considering demurrers,
courts read the allegations liberally and in context, and “treat the demurrer
as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Serrano v. Priest (1971) 5
Cal.3d 584, 591.)  “A demurrer
tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters.
Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or
are judicially noticed.”  (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)  It is error “to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if the
plaintiff shows there is a reasonable possibility any defect identified by the
defendant can be cured by amendment.”  (Aubry v.
Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
In Hightower v. Roman Catholic
Bishop of Sacramento (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 759, the Second
District Court of Appeal considered the timeliness of a childhood-sexual-abuse
action filed in 2004.  The version of
Code of Civil Procedure section 340.1 in effect at that time contained a
one-year revival window, which allowed plaintiffs whose claims had expired
before January 1, 2003 to file new cases by the end of 2003.  To try to meet the revival deadline, the
plaintiff mailed a document titled “MOTION FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE OF INTENT TO SUE
FOR CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ABUSE” to the Sacramento Superior Court on December 31,
2003.  (Hightower, supra, 142
Cal.App.4th at 762.)  On April
5, 2004, he “filed his original complaint[.]” 
(Id. at 763.)  The justices held
that the motion filed on December 31st did not constitute a
complaint and did not satisfy the revival provision.  (See id. at 766-767.)  They also found delayed discovery
inapplicable.  (See id. at 767-768.)  Ultimately, they dismissed the plaintiff’s
case on statute-of-limitations grounds. 
(See id. at 761, 766-769.)
 
Judge Emilie Elias (now retired)
presided over the coordinated Clergy Cases I (JCCP 4286) (“Clergy I”).  There, she and liaison counsel created a
protocol to dismiss cases that were untimely under Hightower and Quarry
v. Doe I (2012) 53 Cal.4th 945. 
On September 12, 2012, she issued an order establishing the Hightower
protocol, requiring plaintiffs to file “Hightower Statement[s]” to show
compliance with Hightower and Quarry.  (Potts Reply Decl., Ex. 7, underling of case
name added.)  Subsequently, on November
16, 2012, she provided all plaintiffs an additional 15 days to complete the Hightower
protocol.  (See id. at Ex. 8.) 
 
Doe Archdiocese and Doe 4 Parish
contend the demurrer should be sustained because the instant case is
duplicative of a Clergy I case that Siler filed in 2010
(30-2010-00433424).  (See Demurrer, pp.
1-5; see also Reply, pp. 1-4; Potts Decl., Exs. 2-4.)  On January 29, 2013, Judge Elias dismissed
the 2010 case with prejudice pursuant to the Hightower protocol because
Siler was “over the age of 26” and failed to file a “Hightower
Statement[.]”  (Potts Decl., Ex. 1,
underlining of case name added.)  As a
result of the dismissal, Doe Archdiocese and Doe 4 Parish assert that the
current case is barred based on the separation-of-powers doctrine.  (See Demurrer, pp. 3-5 [claiming “the
Legislature cannot reverse a final judgment” and citing Quarry for the
proposition that “the Legislature lacks authority to revive an action resolved
in a final judgment that applied a prior limitations period”]; see also Reply,
pp. 1-4; Potts Reply Decl., Exs. 6-10.)
 
Siler claims a
statute-of-limitations dismissal “is not . . . on the merits and does not have
res judicata effect.”  (Opposition, p. 6
[citing Mid-Century Insurance v. Superior Court (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th
769 (“Mid-Century”)], bolding deleted.) 
He also contends the separation-of-powers doctrine does not apply
because he “never had the opportunity to litigate his case individually nor had
the opportunity to have his case heard on the merits.”  (Id. at p. 7 [attempting to distinguish Doe
v. Marysville Joint Unified School District (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th
910 (“Marysville”)].)  He states
that his Clergy I case was stayed when Judge Elias dismissed it and that
he and his counsel did not have input as to the Hightower protocol.  (See, e.g., id. at pp. 2, 5.)     
 
The Court agrees with Doe
Archdiocese and Doe 4 Parish.  The
following points support sustaining the demurrer: 
 
* Siler’s current case is
duplicative (see Demurrer, pp. 1-2; see also Potts Decl., Exs. 2-4);
 
* the stay was not a total,
unlimited stay (see Reply, pp. 2-3);  
 
* use of liaison counsel in
coordinated proceedings is routine;  
 
* input or not, the Hightower
protocol became binding on Siler when Judge Elias issued the September 12, 2012
and November 16, 2012 orders (see, e.g., id. at pp. 1-2)
 
* Judge Elias dismissed Siler’s Clergy
I case with prejudice on January 29, 2013 for failure to comply with the Hightower
protocol (see Potts Decl., Ex. 1);
 
* Siler did not object or appeal
after the dismissal (see Demurrer, p. 3); and,
 
* per the separation-of-powers
doctrine, “[i]f a judgment has
already been entered against the plaintiff on statute of limitations grounds,
enactment of a revival statute does not annul the judgment” (Banke & Segal,
Cal. Practice Guide: Civ. Procedure Before Trial Statutes of Limitations (The
Rutter Group February 2024 Update) ¶ 1:237 [quoting Perez v. Roe I
(2006) 146 Cal.App.4th 171, 188: “Because the power to conclusively
resolve cases by rendering dispositive judgments rests with the judiciary alone
[citation], the Legislature may not reverse final judgments such as those that
were rendered under the previous limitations period of section 340.1”]; see
also Marysville, supra, 89 Cal.App.5th at 919 [citing Perez
with approval, distinguishing Mid-Century, analyzing the section 340.1
version applicable here, and holding: “[R]egardless of why plaintiffs’ claims
were dismissed – whether for failing to comply with the statute of limitations
or the government claims presentation deadline – plaintiffs’ claims were
litigated to finality” and “cannot be revived” via section 340.1]);
 
Siler’s res-judicata argument fails to change the
outcome.  (See Opposition, pp. 5-6.)  Independent of whether res judicata
applies, the demurrer must be sustained because reviving Siler’s claims would
cause a separation-of-powers violation:
 
Plaintiffs do not grapple with the
separation of powers concerns raised by their interpretation. Instead, they
argue that their prior action does not have a res judicata effect because it
was disposed of on statute of limitations grounds, and that permitting
plaintiffs to reopen their case retroactively does not violate the ex post
facto clause of the constitution or due process. These arguments miss the
point. Even if we accepted them as true, they would not resolve the separation
of powers violation that would arise if the statute allowed them to revive
their case.
 
* * *
 
Based on the foregoing, we conclude that
section 340.1’s revival provision means what it says. It exempts from revival
all claims that have been litigated to finality, irrespective of the basis for
the court's final determination.
