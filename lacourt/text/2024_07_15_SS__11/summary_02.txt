Summary in English text:

The Judge rules that the demurrer to the second amended adopted master complaint is sustained. The court agrees with Doe Archdiocese and Doe 4 Parish that Michael Siler's current case is duplicative of a previous case that was dismissed with prejudice, and that the revival of Siler's claims would cause a separation-of-powers violation. The court finds that Siler's allegations of sexual abuse are barred by the statute of limitations and the separation of powers doctrine. The court also finds that Siler did not object or appeal after the dismissal of his previous case, and that the Hightower protocol became binding on Siler when Judge Elias issued the September 12, 2012 and November 16, 2012 orders. The court concludes that the revival of Siler's claims would not be allowed under the statute of limitations and the separation of powers doctrine.
