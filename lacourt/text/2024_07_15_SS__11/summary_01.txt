Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving the Roman Catholic Bishop of Orange (RCBO) and Michael Siler, who claims to have been sexually abused by RCBO priests. RCBO has demurred to Siler's second amended adopted master complaint, alleging that the settlement agreement Siler entered into with RCBO on October 3, 2018, is valid and bars Siler's claims. The Judge has sustained RCBO's demurrer as to the sexual-abuse-based causes of action but has continued the hearing to allow supplemental briefing on the settlement-based causes of action. The Judge has also ordered additional briefing on several specific issues, including whether the separation-of-powers analysis applies to and resolves the settlement-based causes of action, whether the Court should remove the case from the coordination proceeding and transfer it to the Orange Superior Court, and whether there are published appellate opinions allowing misrepresentation and rescission causes of action for a defendant's failure to disclose a pending or unsigned bill.
