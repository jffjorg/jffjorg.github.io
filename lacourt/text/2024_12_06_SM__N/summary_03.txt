And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case Wilshire Quinn Income Fund Reit, LLC v. Victor Lossi. The defendant, Victor Lossi, has moved to quash a subpoena issued by the plaintiff to Google seeking documents and records related to Lossi's personal email and account. The judge has denied this motion, finding that the subpoena is related to a different case and that Lossi and his counsel should have exercised diligence in filing the motion in the correct action.

The plaintiff has also requested monetary sanctions against Lossi and his counsel for failing to diligently file the motion. The judge has granted this request, ordering Lossi and his counsel to pay the plaintiff $600 within 30 days of the entry of this order. This amount represents the time spent drafting an opposition to the motion and appearing at the hearing on the motion.
