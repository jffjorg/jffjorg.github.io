The plaintiff argues that the defendant failed to produce responsive documents, while the defendant argues that the plaintiff had a meaningful opportunity to depose the PMK and that the PMK answered all questions asked. The judge has denied the motion, finding that the plaintiff did not meet and confer with the defendant as to the missing documents and that the plaintiff seeks information related to a specific recall relating to the fuel pump, which was not identified in the Notice of Deposition.
