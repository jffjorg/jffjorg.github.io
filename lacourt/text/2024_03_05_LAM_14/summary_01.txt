Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to strike the answer of defendant S3D Partners, LLC and enter its default. This decision is based on the fact that defendant S3D has been without counsel since October 30, 2023, and has shown no indication of obtaining counsel. As a corporate party, defendant S3D is required to have counsel to prosecute its case in California courts. The judge cites two precedents, CLD Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) and Urethane Foam Experts, Inc. v. Latimer (1995), to support its decision. The judge's intention is to ensure that the defendant is held accountable for its failure to comply with the court's rules and to continue the litigation in a timely and orderly manner.
