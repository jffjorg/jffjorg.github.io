Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the parties' arguments and evidence regarding the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. The defendant, Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, argues that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law because its nurses and staff complied with the standard of care at all times, and nothing they did caused or contributed to the patient's death. The plaintiff, Courtney Brooks, argues that the medical staff's care and treatment did not comply with the standard of care, and that the hospital is liable for the patient's death.

The Court has considered the evidence and arguments presented by both parties and has determined that the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication should be continued for six weeks to allow for additional evidence to be submitted. The Court has ordered the parties to file updated declarations and separate statements reflecting the additional evidence.

The Court has also sustained the plaintiff's evidentiary objections to the defendant's declaration and has declined to rule on the defendant's objections to the plaintiff's exhibits.

The parties are ordered to electronically serve the updated documents on each other and to submit on the tentative by email to the Court.

The defendant argues that its nursing staff complied with the standard of care at all times, and nothing they did caused or contributed to Decedent’s death. The plaintiff argues that the medical records provided to Defendant’s expert were not full and complete records, and that the defendants spoliated the evidence. The judge finds that the plaintiff failed to provide copies of her exhibits with her opposition papers, and therefore, any evidence submitted to the Court is inadmissible. The hearing on this motion is continued for six weeks, and both parties are ordered to file updated evidence and corresponding separate statements.

## Case Summary: 21STCV47583

**Plaintiff:** Courtney Brooks 
**Defendant:** Long Beach Memorial Medical Center ("Medical Center"), Mundi Attinasi, M.D. ("Dr. Attinasi"), Amjuli Kumar, M.D. ("Dr. Kumar"), Glenn Levine, M.D. ("Dr. Levine"),  and Does 1 through 20.
**Case Type:** Wrongful Death from Professional Negligence

**Facts:**

* On December 30, 2021, Plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendants alleging wrongful death from professional negligence.
* Plaintiff's daughter, Marlee Sage Butler ("Marlee"), was born with holoprosencephaly on April 8, 2020.
* Marlee was admitted to Medical Center on July 8, 2020.
* On July 15, 2020, Marlee stopped breathing and became unresponsive, requiring intubation.
* On July 18, 2020, after two brain death tests, Marlee was pronounced dead.

**Issues:**

The core issue is whether the defendants' actions (specifically the nursing staff and potentially the physicians) met the standard of care and whether their actions caused or contributed to Marlee's death.

**Legal Arguments:**

* **Defendant's Argument:**  
    * The defendant argues they are entitled to summary judgment because their nurses and staff complied with the standard of care at all times, and nothing they did caused or contributed to Marlee's death.
    * They also argue they are not liable for any negligence on the part of the physicians because Plaintiff signed a consent form indicating she understood the treating physicians were independent contractors and not agents of Defendant.
* **Plaintiff's Argument:**
    * Plaintiff argues that the defendant's nursing staff's care and treatment did not comply with the standard of care.
    * She asserts the medical records provided to the defendant's expert were not full and complete.
    * She claims the terms of the admissions contract are contradictory.
    * She argues the case should go to trial because the defendant's staff spoliated evidence.

**Judge's Tentative Ruling:**

* The judge notes that the defendant's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication is flawed as it doesn't specify which issues they wish to adjudicate.
* The judge sustains Plaintiff's evidentiary objections regarding the authenticity of the medical records provided by Defendant's attorney.
* The judge continues the hearing for six weeks to allow the parties to address the evidentiary issues and file updated documents.

**Next Steps:**

* Defendant must file a declaration authenticating Plaintiff's medical records and an updated separate statement.
* Plaintiff must file a declaration authenticating all evidence relied upon in her opposition and file it in a viewable format.
* Defendant must file entirely new reply papers.


**Overall:**

The judge is scrutinizing the defendant's attempt to secure summary judgment and is requiring the parties to properly authenticate and present their evidence. This suggests the judge believes there are genuine factual disputes that need to be resolved at trial.

**Tentative Ruling**
**Case Number:** 21STCV47583
**Hearing Date:** September 21, 2023
**Dept:** S27

**Background**
The Plaintiff, Courtney Brooks, filed a Complaint against defendants Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, Mundi Attinasi, M.D., Amjuli Kumar, M.D., Glenn Levine, M.D., and Does 1 through 20, alleging a cause of action for wrongful death from professional negligence. The Plaintiff's daughter, Marlee Sage Butler, was born with holoprosencephaly and passed away on July 18, 2020, after being treated at the Medical Center.

**Motion for Summary Judgment**
The Defendant seeks summary judgment or summary adjudication for three reasons, but fails to specify which causes of action, affirmative defenses, claims for damages, or issues of duty it wishes to have adjudicated.

**Law re: Standard of Care**
The standard of care against which healthcare providers are measured is a matter within the knowledge of experts. Unless the conduct required by the particular circumstances is within the common knowledge of the layman, the standard of care can only be proved by expert testimony.

**Law re: Causation**
To establish that the Defendant's negligence was a "substantial factor" in causing injury or death, the Plaintiff must prove that the negligence was of itself sufficient to bring about that harm.

**Initial Note re: Summary Adjudication**
The Court will only consider the motion for summary judgment and not the purported alternative motion for summary adjudication.

**Parties' Positions**
The Defendant contends that its nurses and staff complied with the standard of care at all times and that nothing they did caused or contributed to the Decedent's death. The Plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that the Defendant's nursing staff's care and treatment did not comply with the standard of care.

**Evidentiary Objections**
The Court sustains the hearsay and lack of foundation objections to the Declaration of Myra Firth, Defendant's attorney of record.

**Continuance of Hearing**
The hearing on this motion is continued for six weeks to Thursday, November 9, 2023. The parties are ordered to file updated documents and declarations authenticating all evidence proffered with the opposition.

**Instructions for Submitting on the Tentative**
Parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court at gdcdepts27@lacourt.org indicating their intention to submit on the tentative as directed by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.
