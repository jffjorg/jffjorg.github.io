Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the parties' arguments and evidence regarding the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. The defendant, Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, argues that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law because its nurses and staff complied with the standard of care at all times, and nothing they did caused or contributed to the patient's death. The plaintiff, Courtney Brooks, argues that the medical staff's care and treatment did not comply with the standard of care, and that the hospital is liable for the patient's death.

The Court has considered the evidence and arguments presented by both parties and has determined that the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication should be continued for six weeks to allow for additional evidence to be submitted. The Court has ordered the parties to file updated declarations and separate statements reflecting the additional evidence.

The Court has also sustained the plaintiff's evidentiary objections to the defendant's declaration and has declined to rule on the defendant's objections to the plaintiff's exhibits.

The parties are ordered to electronically serve the updated documents on each other and to submit on the tentative by email to the Court.
