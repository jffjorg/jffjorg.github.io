And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has made a tentative ruling on the case between Megan Douglas (Plaintiff) and Michele Miller Gardner and Mark Gardner (Defendants). The case revolves around alleged breaches of contract, warranty of habitability, covenant of quiet enjoyment, and negligence, as well as punitive damages. The Plaintiff alleges that the property she rented suffered from various defects, including black mold growth, defective plumbing, and rodent infestation, despite her repeated requests and complaints to the Defendants. The court finds that a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that the Defendants acted despicably and with a conscious disregard of the Plaintiff's health and safety, which is the definition of "malice" under Civil Code ยง3294. The court denies the Defendants' motion to strike the complaint and orders them to file an answer to the complaint within 10 days.
