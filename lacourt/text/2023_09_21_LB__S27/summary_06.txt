**English Summary:**

This case involves a landlord-tenant dispute.  Megan Douglas (Plaintiff) sued Michele Miller Gardner and Mark Gardner (Defendants) for damages related to alleged property defects during her tenancy. 

Plaintiff claims the property had serious problems like black mold, plumbing issues, and pest infestations, and that she repeatedly notified Defendants who failed to make necessary repairs.  

Defendants asked the judge to strike Plaintiff's request for punitive damages. The judge denied this request, stating that a jury could find Defendants acted with malice (intentional disregard for Plaintiff's safety) based on the alleged facts. The judge also rejected Defendants' argument that Plaintiff didn't clearly state which Defendant was responsible for what, explaining that the lawsuit centers on their collective failure to act.


The judge ordered Defendants to file a formal response to the lawsuit within ten days.
