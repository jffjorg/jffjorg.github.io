Summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to transfer venue filed by the Defendants, One World Ranches, LLC, Karmdeep S. Bains, Harpreet B. Bains, and Karmdeep and Harpreet Bains. The Defendants sought to transfer the venue from Los Angeles County to Sutter County, where they reside, claiming that their principal place of business is actually in Sutter County, despite designating Los Angeles County as their principal place of business with the Secretary of State. The Judge denied the motion, citing the case law in Rosas v. Superior Court (1994), which holds that a corporation is bound by its designation of its principal place of business for venue purposes.

The Judge also awarded sanctions to the Plaintiff, Saralida Ruiz, in the amount of $3000, finding that the Defendants' motion was made in bad faith and without legal basis. The Judge also ordered the Defendants' counsel to pay the sanctions to the Plaintiff.

**English Summary:**

The judge ruled against the defendants' motion to transfer venue from Los Angeles County to Sutter County.

The judge also awarded sanctions of $3,000 to the plaintiff. The judge found that the defendants acted unreasonably by filing the motion to transfer venue after the plaintiff had explained the legal basis for the case remaining in Los Angeles County.

Here is the summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to transfer venue filed by the defendants. The plaintiff, Saralida Ruiz, filed an action against the defendants, One World Ranches, LLC, Karmdeep S. Bains, Harpreet B. Bains, and Karmdeep and Harpreet Bains, for damages arising from a fall down a set of stairs on the defendants' property. The defendants contend that venue is proper in Sutter County, where the incident occurred and where they reside, while the plaintiff argues that venue is proper in Los Angeles County, where at least one defendant resides.

The Judge has denied the motion to transfer venue, citing California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) §397(a) and Rosas v. Superior Court (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 671, 677. The Judge found that the defendants' designation of Los Angeles County as their principal place of business with the Secretary of State is sufficient to establish that they reside in that county.

The Judge has also awarded sanctions to the plaintiff in the amount of $3000, which includes six hours of travel and appearance time, as well as costs associated with travel to Los Angeles. The Judge has also ordered the defendants to pay the plaintiff's attorney's fees in connection with the motion.

**Case Summary**

*Case Number:* 23LBCV00586

*Hearing Date:* September 21, 2023

*Dept:* S27

**Parties:**

* Plaintiff: Saralida Ruiz
* Defendants: One World Ranches, LLC, Karmdeep S. Bains, Harpreet B. Bains, and Karmdeep and Harpreet Bains (in their individual and trust capacities)

**Background:**

The case involves a personal injury claim by the plaintiff against the defendants arising from a fall on the defendants' property in Sutter County.

**Motion to Transfer Venue:**

* Defendants moved to transfer the venue to Sutter County, arguing that the current venue in Los Angeles County is improper.
* Defendants claim that their principal place of business is actually in Sutter County despite designating Los Angeles County with the Secretary of State.
* Plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that venue is proper in Los Angeles County as it is where at least one defendant resides.

**Law Governing Venue:**

* Pursuant to CCP §397(a), the Court must transfer venue if the action was filed in the wrong county.
* Pursuant to CCP §395(a), venue in a personal injury action is proper in the county where the injury occurred and also in the county where any defendant resides.
* §395.5 defines "residence" for a corporate defendant as that corporate defendant's principal place of business.
* Per Rosas v. Superior Court (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 671, a corporation is bound for venue purposes by its designation of its principal place of business in corporate documents filed with the Secretary of State.

**Court's Ruling:**

* The motion to transfer venue is denied as defendants failed to provide any authority supporting their argument that an entity's owners' residence can nullify its corporate designation.
* The plaintiff's opposition established that venue is legally proper in Los Angeles County.

**Sanctions:**

* Both parties sought sanctions, but only the plaintiff's request was granted.
* The plaintiff will receive $3,000 in sanctions for reasonable expenses and attorney's fees incurred due to the defendants' improper motion to transfer venue.

**Case Management Conference:**

* The parties are reminded of the concurrent Case Management Conference and are asked to make arrangements to appear remotely.
