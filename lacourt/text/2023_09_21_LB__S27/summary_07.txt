Summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to transfer venue filed by the Defendants, One World Ranches, LLC, Karmdeep S. Bains, Harpreet B. Bains, and Karmdeep and Harpreet Bains. The Defendants sought to transfer the venue from Los Angeles County to Sutter County, where they reside, claiming that their principal place of business is actually in Sutter County, despite designating Los Angeles County as their principal place of business with the Secretary of State. The Judge denied the motion, citing the case law in Rosas v. Superior Court (1994), which holds that a corporation is bound by its designation of its principal place of business for venue purposes.

The Judge also awarded sanctions to the Plaintiff, Saralida Ruiz, in the amount of $3000, finding that the Defendants' motion was made in bad faith and without legal basis. The Judge also ordered the Defendants' counsel to pay the sanctions to the Plaintiff.
