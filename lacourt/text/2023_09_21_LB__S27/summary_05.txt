And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages against Connor Headey. The judge has determined that the allegations in the complaint are insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. The complaint alleges that Connor Headey was the designated driver but chose to consume alcohol despite this status, and was driving at an excessively dangerous speed, making sudden sharp, erratic turns without using turn signals, all in a residential area next to a park. However, the complaint does not allege any additional meaningful aggravating factors, such as the level of intoxication or details about the sharp and erratic turns. The judge has granted the motion to strike, but has conditionally granted leave to amend if the plaintiff can state facts in compliance with Dawes v. Superior Court (1980).
