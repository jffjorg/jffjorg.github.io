And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages against Connor Headey. The judge has determined that the allegations in the complaint are insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. The complaint alleges that Connor Headey was the designated driver but chose to consume alcohol despite this status, and was driving at an excessively dangerous speed, making sudden sharp, erratic turns without using turn signals, all in a residential area next to a park. However, the complaint does not allege any additional meaningful aggravating factors, such as the level of intoxication or details about the sharp and erratic turns. The judge has granted the motion to strike, but has conditionally granted leave to amend if the plaintiff can state facts in compliance with Dawes v. Superior Court (1980).

 **English Summary:**

The Judge has tentatively ruled to strike the request for punitive damages against Connor Headey in this case involving an automobile accident with a bicyclist.  The Judge found that the complaint, as it stands, does not provide enough specific details to show that Connor Headey acted with a "conscious disregard" for the safety of others.  This is a key legal requirement for awarding punitive damages, which are intended to punish particularly egregious conduct. 

The Plaintiff has been given the opportunity to amend their complaint to include more specific facts that could support a punitive damages claim. If they choose to do so, they have 20 days to file the amended complaint. If they do not amend, the Defendant must file an answer to the complaint, but the request for punitive damages will be removed.

## English Summary 

The judge has decided to strike (remove) the part of the lawsuit where Plaintiff Eric Diaz asks for punitive damages against Defendant Connor Headey.  The judge found that the current complaint doesn't provide enough details about Connor Headey's alleged intoxication and reckless driving to justify punitive damages.

The judge recognizes that driving under the influence can sometimes lead to punitive damages, but only if there's evidence showing a "conscious disregard" for the safety of others and that the conduct was "despicable." The current complaint doesn't meet that standard, according to the judge. 

The Plaintiff has 20 days to revise their lawsuit and add stronger evidence to support their claim for punitive damages. If they don't, the case will proceed without that claim. 



Let me know if you have any other questions.
