 Case Number:  22LBCV01000    Hearing Date:   September 21, 2023    Dept:  S27 1.     Motion
to Be Relieved as Counsel
Plaintiff, Maria Angie Gonzalez’s
attorney of record, David Azizi, moves to be relieved as counsel.  Counsel declares there has been an
irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, such that further
representation is not possible.  The
motion is denied without prejudice for two reasons.  
 
First, Counsel declares the moving
papers were served on Client at an address he was unable to confirm.  Counsel declares he attempted to confirm the
address via telephone, and certified mail, and a TLO search.  The Court wishes to hear from Counsel, at the
hearing, concerning the results of each of these attempts.  Did Counsel receive the signed return
receipt?  Did Counsel get Plaintiff’s
voicemail?  Did Counsel leave a
message?  Does counsel have an e-mail
address for Plaintiff?  What were the
results of the TLO search?  Counsel must
address these issues by way of an amended declaration.  If Counsel is unable to serve Plaintiff at a
confirmed address, Counsel must serve the moving papers on the Clerk of the
Court pursuant to CCP §1101(b) and CRC 3.1362(d).  
 
Second, there is no proof of
service on Plaintiff at her last-known address. 
Even if the address is not confirmed, Counsel must file proof of service
of the moving papers at the last-known address.
 
2.     CMC
and OSC
Counsel is reminded that there is a
case management conference and an OSC re: proof of service on calendar concurrently
with the hearing on the motion to be relieved. 
The Court asks Counsel to make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing
on the motion and the CMC/OSC.
