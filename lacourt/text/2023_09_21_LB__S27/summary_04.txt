## English Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by David Azizi, Maria Gonzalez's attorney, to be relieved as counsel. The judge denies the motion without prejudice, meaning it can be refiled, for two reasons. 

First, the judge requires more information about Azizi's attempts to serve Gonzalez with the motion. Azizi claims he couldn't confirm Gonzalez's address and tried contacting her by phone, certified mail, and a TLO search. The judge wants details on the results of these attempts, including whether he received a signed return receipt, left a voicemail, or has an email address for Gonzalez.

Second, Azizi hasn't provided proof of service at Gonzalez's last known address, even if he couldn't confirm her current address.

The judge reminds Azizi that there's a case management conference and an order to show cause regarding proof of service scheduled for the same date as the hearing on the motion. The judge also asks Azizi to appear remotely for both the hearing and the CMC/OSC.
