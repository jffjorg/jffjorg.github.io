## English Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by David Azizi, Maria Gonzalez's attorney, to be relieved as counsel. The judge denies the motion without prejudice, meaning it can be refiled, for two reasons. 

First, the judge requires more information about Azizi's attempts to serve Gonzalez with the motion. Azizi claims he couldn't confirm Gonzalez's address and tried contacting her by phone, certified mail, and a TLO search. The judge wants details on the results of these attempts, including whether he received a signed return receipt, left a voicemail, or has an email address for Gonzalez.

Second, Azizi hasn't provided proof of service at Gonzalez's last known address, even if he couldn't confirm her current address.

The judge reminds Azizi that there's a case management conference and an order to show cause regarding proof of service scheduled for the same date as the hearing on the motion. The judge also asks Azizi to appear remotely for both the hearing and the CMC/OSC.

Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Judge denies Plaintiff Maria Angie Gonzalez's attorney of record, David Azizi's, motion to be relieved as counsel without prejudice for two reasons. First, Azizi has not provided sufficient evidence that he has served the moving papers on Gonzalez at a confirmed address. Azizi must address this issue by way of an amended declaration and serve the moving papers on the Clerk of the Court if he is unable to serve Gonzalez at a confirmed address. Second, there is no proof of service on Gonzalez at her last-known address.

Additionally, the Judge reminds Azizi of the concurrent case management conference (CMC) and OSC regarding proof of service on the same date as the hearing on the motion to be relieved. Azizi is required to make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing.
