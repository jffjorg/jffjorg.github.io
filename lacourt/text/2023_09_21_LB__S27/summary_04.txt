And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

Judge denies the motion of David Azizi, attorney for Maria Angie Gonzalez, to be relieved as counsel without prejudice. The judge requires Azizi to address several issues, including the results of his attempts to serve the moving papers on Gonzalez at her last-known address, and to provide proof of service at that address. If Azizi is unable to confirm Gonzalez's address, he must serve the papers on the Clerk of the Court instead. The judge also reminds Azizi that a case management conference and an order to show cause re: proof of service are scheduled for the same date as the hearing on the motion to be relieved.
