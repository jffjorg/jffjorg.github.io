Here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling concerns a motion by Plaintiff Donna Bailey to file a Third Amended Complaint against Defendants Darelyne Heacock and Farmers and Merchants Trust Company. The motion seeks to add a cause of action for negligent hiring, training, supervision, and/or retention of Heacock. The Court has previously sustained a demurrer to a similar cause of action and clarified that no claim for negligent hiring and retention is encompassed by the negligence cause of action.

The Court has considered the evidence presented in support of the motion and finds that it does not support a claim for negligent training, hiring, supervision, and/or retention. The Plaintiff failed to provide any evidence that tends to show Farmers and Merchants Trust Company did or failed to do something that caused Heacock to assault Plaintiff.

As a result, the motion for leave to amend is denied. The Court finds that the Plaintiff did not unreasonably delay in filing the motion and that the delay did not prejudice the Defendant. However, the Court also notes that the Plaintiff failed to provide sufficient evidence to support the proposed cause of action and that the motion for leave to amend is therefore denied.

**Case Number:** 21STCV14469
**Hearing Date:** September 21, 2023, Dept: S27

**Parties:**
- Plaintiff: Donna Bailey
- Defendants: Darelyne Heacock and Farmers and Merchants Trust Company

**Background Facts:**
Donna Bailey filed a lawsuit against Darelyne Heacock and Farmers and Merchants Trust Company for damages arising from a landlord-tenant dispute. Bailey, who alleges she is disabled, has ongoing disputes with the defendants about parking and use of a garage on the property, and claims Heacock assaulted her in connection with one of these disputes.

**Court Proceedings:**
- November 2, 2021: Court heard demurrers and motions to strike directed at the FAC. Sustained and granted pleading challenges in part, ordered Bailey to file an SAC.
- June 23, 2022: Court heard demurrers and motions to strike directed at the SAC. Sustained demurrers as to the hostile environment harassment cause of action without leave to amend, deemed the motion to strike moot as to that cause of action, otherwise denied the motion to strike, and ordered Defendants to file an answer to the SAC with the hostile environment harassment cause of action deemed stricken.
- April 11, 2023: Court heard Defendant’s motion to clarify regarding the negligence cause of action. Clarified that there was no claim for negligence hiring and retention encompassed by the negligence cause of action pled against F&M.
- June 2, 2023: Court heard Plaintiff’s motion to compel and F&M’s motion for a protective order. Ruled that Plaintiff can conduct Jeremy Clark’s (F&M employee) deposition on the subject of negligent hiring, training, retention, and/or supervision of Heacock.

**Current Motion:**
- Bailey moves to file a Third Amended Complaint, asserting a cause of action for negligent training, hiring, supervision, and/or retention of Heacock.
- Court will consider whether prior rulings preclude Plaintiff from making this motion, the standard for ruling on the motion, whether Plaintiff delayed in bringing the motion and if it prejudiced Defendant, and whether the proposed TAC states a cause of action for negligent training, hiring, supervision, and/or retention.
- Court finds Plaintiff did not unreasonably delay in filing this motion and denies the motion for leave to amend as Plaintiff failed to provide evidence that F&M breached any duty that caused Heacock to assault Plaintiff.

**Order:**
- Plaintiff is ordered to give notice.
