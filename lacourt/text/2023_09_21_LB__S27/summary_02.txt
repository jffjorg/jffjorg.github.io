Here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling concerns a motion by Plaintiff Donna Bailey to file a Third Amended Complaint against Defendants Darelyne Heacock and Farmers and Merchants Trust Company. The motion seeks to add a cause of action for negligent hiring, training, supervision, and/or retention of Heacock. The Court has previously sustained a demurrer to a similar cause of action and clarified that no claim for negligent hiring and retention is encompassed by the negligence cause of action.

The Court has considered the evidence presented in support of the motion and finds that it does not support a claim for negligent training, hiring, supervision, and/or retention. The Plaintiff failed to provide any evidence that tends to show Farmers and Merchants Trust Company did or failed to do something that caused Heacock to assault Plaintiff.

As a result, the motion for leave to amend is denied. The Court finds that the Plaintiff did not unreasonably delay in filing the motion and that the delay did not prejudice the Defendant. However, the Court also notes that the Plaintiff failed to provide sufficient evidence to support the proposed cause of action and that the motion for leave to amend is therefore denied.
