 ====================================================================

BACKGROUND 
 
On March 3, 2020, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance
Company (“Plaintiff”) filed its Complaint against Juan Crisosto Tihuila aka
Juan Carlos Crus Lico aka Juan Crisostomo Tihuila (“Defendant”), and Does 1
through 5, inclusive for property damage in the amount of $17,625.90.
 
On February 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to
set aside the dismissal filed pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6
and to enter judgment against Defendant for default on the stipulation for
judgment. 
 
No opposition has been filed as of April 24, 2024.  
 
 
ANALYSIS 
 
I.          Legal Standard
Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6, subdivision (a) provides that “[i]f
parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties
outside the presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of
the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant
to the terms of the settlement.” In ruling on a motion to enter judgment, the
court acts as a trier of fact. The court must determine whether the parties
entered into a valid and binding settlement.
To do so, the court may receive oral testimony in addition to declarations. (Kohn
v. Jaymar-Ruby, Inc. (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1530, 1533.)
“[W]here
the plaintiff has filed a voluntary dismissal of an action …, the court is
without jurisdiction to act further …, and any subsequent orders of the court
are simply void.” (Paniagua v. Orange County Fire Auth. (2007) 149
Cal.App.4th 83, 89, (internal quotes omitted).) The result is different where a
signed, written settlement agreement (or oral settlement before the court)
states the court retains jurisdiction to enforce the settlement because that
agreement could be enforced under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. (See Wackeen
v. Malis (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 429, 439- 440; Khavarian Enterprises,
Inc. v. Commline, Inc. (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 310, 326—court had continuing
jurisdiction to consider attorney fees and costs motions after dismissal where
settlement agreement provided court retained jurisdiction to enforce agreement
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6.)
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 664.6, subdivision (a) further states “[i]f
requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to
enforce the settlement.” The request should be made while the court still has
jurisdiction. (Wackeen v. Malis, supra, 97 CA4th at 433; see Sayta v.
Chu (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 960, 962.)
 
II.        Discussion 
 
On or about
September 15, 2020, Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a written stipulation
for the entry of judgment (the “Stipulation”), which obligation would be
discharged upon the payment of $13,725.90; Defendant was to pay $100.00 a month.
(Susan M. Benson Decl., ¶ 3; Ex. “1.”)  
 
Defendant was
sent a default payment letter on September 8, 2023, advising Defendant of the
default and the $11,510.05 balance then due, but the post office was unable to
locate Defendant at the addresses provided; Defendant never provided notice of
an updated address as required by the Stipulation. (Benson Decl., ¶¶ 4-5; Ex.
“2.”) On September 15, 2023, Defendant made an additional payment of $150.00
bringing the total amount Defendant has paid towards the balance of the
settlement to $2,365.85, and leaving a balance due and owing in the sum of $11,360.05.
(Benson Decl., ¶ 6.) 
 
Defendant was
sent a default payment letter at Defendant’s newly discovered address on
November 21, 2023, advising Defendant of the default and the balance then due
in the sum of $11,360.05. (Benson Decl., ¶ 7; Ex. “3.”) Defendant has failed to
pay any monies since the Notice of Default was sent. (Benson Decl., ¶ 8.) 
 
The Stipulation appears
to have been executed, with signatures from the two parties. (Benson Decl.; Ex.
“1.”) As such, there is a valid agreement. 
 
On October 15,
2020, the Stipulation was filed with the Court to allow the Court jurisdiction
to enforce the stipulation. The Order for Dismissal and Court Retaining
Jurisdiction was signed on October 15, 2020. Therefore, the Court has
jurisdiction to enforce this Stipulation.
 
Plaintiff
contends Defendant failed to make payments and that the balance due is $11,360.05.
(Benson Decl., ¶¶ 7-8.) Plaintiff requests judgment entered in the sum of
$11,818.70, for a total principal of 11,360.05, plus costs of suit in the sum
of $386.65, plus filing costs of $72.00 for this motion. (Benson Decl., ¶ 10.)
 
The Court finds
Plaintiff has established that there was a valid agreement between the parties,
that the Court retains jurisdiction, and that there is a need to set aside the
dismissal and enter judgment against Defendant. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Accordingly, the
Court GRANTS the Motion to Set Aside the Dismissal Entered on 10/15/2020 and to
Enter Judgment against the Defendant. 
 
Judgment is
entered for Plaintiff and against the Defendant in the total amount of
$11,818.70.
 
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
