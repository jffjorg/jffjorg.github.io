And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint, which seeks to quiet title to a property located at 9917 Wiley Burke Avenue in Downey, California. The defendant argues that the proposed cross-complaint is compulsory and that the plaintiff has not demonstrated bad faith in failing to file the cross-complaint earlier. The court finds that the defendant has acted in good faith and that the proposed cross-complaint is compulsory, and therefore grants the motion. The defendant is ordered to serve and file the cross-complaint within 10 days of this order.
