Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is considering a demurrer filed by the defendant in a wrongful death and survival action lawsuit. The lawsuit was filed by Ebong (junior), Donnisha, and Marcus, who are the siblings of Raheem Udo-Ukon, who died on December 26, 2021. Ebong (senior), Raheem's father, was named as a nominal defendant in the original complaint, but he has now filed a cross-complaint seeking to bring his own wrongful death and survival actions.

The Judge is not persuaded by the defendant's argument that Ebong cannot file a cross-complaint because he is not a plaintiff, but rather a nominal defendant. The Judge finds that the law is well-settled that a nominal defendant is really a plaintiff, and that Ebong has not forever waived his right to sue for wrongful death.

The Judge also considers the defendant's argument that Ebong's cross-complaint is barred by the statute of limitations. The Judge finds that the statute of limitations is two years, and that Ebong's cross-complaint was filed late. However, the Judge is not convinced that the relation back doctrine does not apply, and may allow the cross-complaint to relate back to the original filing date.

In the survival action, the Judge finds that Ebong is the successor-in-interest and can bring the action. The Judge also finds that the relation back doctrine does apply, and that the survival action is not barred by the statute of limitations.

The Judge rules that the demurrer is overruled, allowing the lawsuit to proceed. The defendant has 30 days to answer the complaint, and Ebong may file an opposition to any motion for judgment on the pleadings that the defendant may file.
