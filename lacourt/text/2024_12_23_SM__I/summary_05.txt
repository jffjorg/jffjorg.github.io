And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in an unlawful detainer action brought by Jedamist, a California General Partnership against a defendant who has not paid rent. The defendant demurred to the complaint, alleging defects in parties and uncertainty. The court has overruled the demurrer and ordered the defendant to answer within 5 days. The court held that the complaint is not uncertain and that the addition of Jedamist, Inc. as a party is not required. The court also found that the complaint adequately sets forth the relevant facts and that the failure to attach the entire lease document does not render the complaint flawed. The judge notes that if the defendant believes that there are material issues that were not addressed in the demurrer, it can address those issues on summary judgment.
