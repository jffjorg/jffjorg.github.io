 Case Number:  24SMCV01343    Hearing Date:   December 23, 2024    Dept:  I The motion to quash is GRANTED.  Plaintiff alleges breach of contract and
fraud against defendant Jones.  Defendant
moves to quash, asserting that he was not properly served.  Although there is no opposition, at the last
hearing plaintiff indicated that she did oppose the motion.  
 
There is a preliminary question.  Defendant served plaintiff at an address on
Maxella Avenue.  However, that is not the
address the court has on file.  If
defendant did not serve the motion properly, then that would mean that the
court cannot hear the motion.
 
Assuming that the court can hear the motion, defendant
asserts two grounds.  The first is that
the service was jurisdictionally out of time, and the second is that the
personal service did not actually occur. 
As to the first, the defense is wrong. 
While the Code of Civil Procedure does set forth the time in which
service should be accomplished, that is not a jurisdictional time limit.  Late service, while not a good thing, still
counts.  Thus, even if defendant is
correct that the service occurred at a time outside the statutory period, that
would not be a ground to quash.
 
The more significant issue is whether defendant was actually
served.  Service is technical; it is not
enough that the defendant be aware of the lawsuit, defendant must also be
properly served.  And that is a problem
here.  The Notice and Acknowledgement is
not sufficient because defendant did not sign it.  This is a form of service that is valid when
it is filed containing the defendant’s signature because it demonstrates that
defendant has acknowledged proper service. 
The quid pro quo for obtaining that signature is that the
defendant has a little bit more time to respond to the complaint.  Here, because defendant did not sign it, it
is of no effect.  Of course, there are
other ways to serve.  Personal service is
one such way.  If a defendant is served
personally, it does not matter whether defendant acknowledges it or not.  Here, there is a declaration of service by
the process server.  However, the
declaration does not state that the process server placed the complaint and
summons into defendant’s hand or that defendant was at the door, knew that
service was being attempted, and refused to open the door.  Rather, it shows that the process server
(after making an unsuccessful attempt at what was believed to be defendant’s
place of employment) went to the address and thinks that defendant might have
been inside, but did not see him or speak with him.  That is not sufficient.  In addition, it appears that the summons and
complaint might have been mailed to defendant. 
That may be so, but mailing the summons and complaint to a defendant
within California is not good service. 
Because there is no evidence that defendant was properly served, coupled
with defendant’s affirmative denial that he was served, the court does not believe
it can find service was proper, and therefore the motion must be GRANTED.  Plaintiff may, however, continue to attempt
service on defendant.
 
The court will float an alternative idea.  Because defendant is plainly aware of the
case, rather than make plaintiff expend the time and money to effect service
(for which defendant might well be forced to pay in the end), which could
include having the process server show up at defendant’s workplace, some family
event, at the child custody exchange to effectuate service in front of the
child, or in the early morning hours, perhaps defendant will stipulate that he is
served effective today.  That will mean
that defendant will have 30 days from today to answer or otherwise respond to
the complaint and we can all do away with the formality of serving defendant
technically with process of which he is already aware.  In the court’s experience, agreeing to such a
stipulation is what people do who believe that they will win on the merits;
refusing is what people do when their major goal is to inflict harm or burden
on the other side.  Having said that,
there are exceptions to every rule, and defendant is under no obligation to
agree to this proposal.  If defendant
refuses to agree, the court will set a new CMC hearing and plaintiff will have
to serve defendant according to Code. 
The court will also direct defendant to be present in court
personally—not remotely—if he wants to attend that hearing, or, if he has
counsel, counsel may attend personally. 
It is just a suggestion so that we can move forward.
