Trial Date: UNSET
Case Name: MARY KHAMTRASHYAN v. STATE FARM MUTUAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE COMPANY
3
TENTATIVE RULINGS – COMPEL RESPONSES

In the instant case, no Complaint has been filed. According to moving
Respondent, State Farm, this action is by Claimant, Mary Khamtrashyan, to
recover damages for injuries she allegedly sustained in a motor vehicle
incident which occurred on February 9, 2020. 
 
The first document on file with the Court in this matter is
a Petition to Assign Case Number wherein State Farm sought to have a case
number assigned to the instant “underinsured motorist arbitration action
pursuant to California Insurance Code, section 11580.2(f)(1).” (Pet.
Assign Case Number, 7/10/23.)
 
Motion 1 pertains to Respondent compelling responses to
Demand for Production, Set One.
 
Motion 2 pertains to Respondent compelling responses to
Form Interrogatories, Set One.
 
Motion 3 pertains to Respondent compelling responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set One.
 
MOTION 1
 
RELIEF REQUESTED¿ 
Respondent, State
Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, moves for an order compelling
Claimant, Mary Khamtrashyan, to provide verified answers, without objections,
to Demands for Production, Set One.

$2,060.00 for the reasonable expenses and attorney fees incurred by the Movant
in connection with this proceeding as a result of Claimant’s failure to provide
any responses to discovery.

Day Lapse (CCP §12c and §1005(b):Ok
Proof of Service Timely Filed (CRC, Rule 3.1300): Ok
Correct Address (CCP §1013, §1013a): No – At the hearing, the Court will
address the issue of the what the proper service address is for Mary
Khamtrashyan. The instant motion was allegedly served by electronic
transmission on December 4, 2023. Problematic is that the instant motion was
served electronically to marykhamtrashyan@yahoo.com. However, on eCourt, Mary’s
email address is listed as tsenglaw@lawyer.com. Tseng & Associates is State
Farm’s counsel, not Mary’s. So the Movant should address why tsenglaw@lawyer.com
is listed as the email address for Mary, a self-represented litigant. Further,
the Court should inquire as to how it can confirm what Mary’s proper email address
is and if she has consented to electronic service. Additionally, the Court
notes that State Farm’s counsel, Tseng & Associates, does not have an email
address listed on eCourt.

LEGAL STANDARD – COMPEL RESPONSES, INSPECTION DEMANDS
Within
30 days after service of a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling, the party to whom the demand is directed shall serve the original of
the response to it on the party making the demand, and a copy of the response
on all other parties who have appeared in the action, unless on motion of the
party making the demand, the court has shortened the time for response, or
unless on motion of the party to whom the demand has been directed, the court
has extended the time for response. (CCP §2031.260(a).)
If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
party making the demand may move for an order compelling response to the
demand. (CCP §2031.300(b).)
If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
party to whom the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
directed waives any objection to the demand, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). (CCP §2031.300(a).) “The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280. (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response was
the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (CCP
§2031.300(a)(1)-(2).)
Unlike a motion to compel further responses, a motion
to compel responses is not subject to a 45-day time limit, and the propounding
party does not have to demonstrate either good cause or that it satisfied a
“meet and confer” requirement. (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.
Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404
citing Weil and Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The
Rutter Group 2006) ¶¶8:1137 to 8:1144, pp. 8F-59 to 8F-60, ¶¶ 8:1483 to 8:1489,
pp. 8H-29 to hH-30 (Weil & Brown).)



ANALYSIS
On
February 21, 2023, Respondent served Mary Khamtrashyan Demands for Production,
Set One. (Goldberg Decl. ¶3.) On April 27, 2023, Respondent’s counsel sent a
meet and confer to Claimant requesting that Claimant provide verified responses
without objections on or before May 4, 2023. (Goldberg Decl. ¶5.) As of the
date of Respondent’s counsel’s declaration on December 4, 2023, Claimant has
not provided verified responses without objections. (Goldberg Decl. ¶6.)
TENTATIVE RULING MOTION 1
Here, Mary Khamtrashyan
has not provided responses within 30 days of service of Demands for Production,
Set One. The Court is inclined to GRANT this motion; however, it has a few
issues that it needs Respondent to address at the instant hearing. First, are
the issues the Court previously noted with respect to whether this motion was
properly served. Second, the Court notes that the discovery itself, Demands for
Production, Set One, may potentially face some of the same service issues that
the instant motion faced because the discovery was served via electronic
transmission to marykhamtrashyan@yahoo.com. Therefore, Respondent needs to
address the service issue with respect to the motion itself and with respect to
the discovery. If Respondent can demonstrate proper service of the motion and
of the discovery, the Court is inclined to GRANT the instant motion. If the
Court grants the motion, Claimant is to provide verified responses without
objection within 15 days of this hearing.

Sanctions
Respondent
moves for an order that Claimant pay a monetary sanction to Respondent in the
sum of $2,060.00 for the reasonable expenses and attorney fees incurred by the
Respondent in connection with this proceeding as a result of Claimant’s failure
to provide any responses. 
In relevant part, 2031.300(c) states as follows:
Except as provided
in subdivision (d), the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.
 
(CCP
§2031.300(c).)
 
“The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act
in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no
opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn,
or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion
was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348(a).) 
Respondent’s counsel
requests sanctions as follows: (1) $400 per hour; (2) Three hours preparing the
motion; (3) Anticipation of another hour preparing the reply brief; (4) Another
hour appearing at the hearing on the motion; and (5) $60.00 for the filing fee.
The Court will take up the issue of sanctions at the
hearing.

LEGAL STANDARD – COMPEL RESPONSES, INTERROGATORIES
Within 30 days after service of interrogatories, the party to whom the
interrogatories are propounded shall serve the original of the response to them
on the propounding party, unless on motion of the propounding party the court
has shortened the time for response, or unless on motion of the responding
party the court has extended the time for response. (CCP § 2030.260(a).)
If
a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response,
the party propounding the interrogatories may move for an order compelling
response to the interrogatories. (CCP § 2030.290(b).)
“The
party to whom the interrogatories are directed waives any right to exercise the
option to produce writings under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to
the interrogatories, including one based on privilege or on the protection for
work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on
motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that both
of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently
served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210,
2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240. (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely
