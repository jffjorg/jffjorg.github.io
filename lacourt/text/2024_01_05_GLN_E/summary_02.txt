Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses three motions filed by State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (Respondent) to compel Claimant Mary Khamtrashyan to provide responses to discovery. The motions were served via electronic transmission to marykhamtrashyan@yahoo.com, which is problematic because Mary's email address on eCourt is listed as tsenglaw@lawyer.com, which is the email address of State Farm's counsel, not Mary's. The Court is concerned about the service of the motions and discovery and will address the issue of the proper service address for Mary Khamtrashyan at the hearing. The Court is inclined to grant the motions to compel responses to discovery, but will require Claimant to provide verified responses within 15 days of the hearing. The Court will also consider the issue of sanctions against Claimant.
