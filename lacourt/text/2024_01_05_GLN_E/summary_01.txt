Summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to bifurcate the causes of action in the First Amended Complaint and First Amended Cross-Complaint. The motion was filed by the Defendants/Cross-Complainants, Robert Friedland and Careen A. Friedland, seeking to bifurcate the quiet title and prescriptive easement causes of action in the First Amended Complaint and the quiet title cause of action in the First Amended Cross-Complaint from the nuisance and trespass causes of action. The Court found that bifurcation would not promote judicial economy or efficiency, and would instead create unnecessary complexity and duplication of effort. The Court also noted that the issues in the case are not complex or novel, and that the parties have already had numerous motions and ex parte proceedings. The hearing on the motion to bifurcate is scheduled for January 5, 2024.
