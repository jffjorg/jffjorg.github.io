And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents filed by Benny He against Porsche Cars North America, Inc. The motion was filed in connection with a complaint alleging violations of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.

The judge finds that Porsche Cars North America, Inc.'s responses to the requests for production of documents are incomplete and evasive, and therefore grants the motion to compel further responses with respect to certain requests. The judge also overrules Porsche Cars North America, Inc.'s objections to the requests.

However, the judge denies the motion to compel further responses with respect to certain other requests, finding that the plaintiff has not shown good cause for the requests. The judge also tentatively plans to deny the motion as to certain other requests, pending further argument.

The judge notes that Porsche Cars North America, Inc. has failed to comply with California Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.220, which requires a party to state that it will comply in full with a request for production of documents. The judge also finds that Porsche Cars North America, Inc.'s responses are not code-compliant with stating it will comply in full.

The judge orders Porsche Cars North America, Inc. to provide a verified, code-compliant, further response to the requests for production of documents without objection within a certain number of days of the hearing. The judge also grants Porsche Cars North America, Inc.'s request for judicial notice of the complaint.
