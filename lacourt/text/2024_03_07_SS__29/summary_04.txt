The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to continue the trial date. The Plaintiff, Felisha Willis, and the Defendant, Southwest Airlines, jointly filed the motion. The trial was originally scheduled for July 17, 2024, but the parties have shown good cause for a continuance due to the unavailability of counsel and the need to complete discovery. Specifically, the Defendant has trials scheduled on July 19, 26, 29, and August 2, 6, and counsel for both parties are unavailable for trial on July 17, 2024. Additionally, discovery requires additional time, including the need to subpoena Plaintiff's treatment and billing records from out-of-state medical providers and take out-of-state witness depositions. The Judge finds that the parties have shown good cause for a continuance and grants the motion, advancing the trial date to approximately October 4, 2024.
