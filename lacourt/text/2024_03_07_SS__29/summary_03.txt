And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling in the case of Elvia Irene Avila Perez, who filed a petition to approve a compromise for her 20-year-old disabled daughter, Victoria De Silverio Avila. The Court has reviewed the petition and found that there is no order appointing Elvia Irene Avila Perez as guardian ad litem or conservator for her daughter. According to California Code of Civil Procedure ยง 372(a)(3), the guardian or conservator must have the power to compromise with the approval of the Court. Since the petition does not meet this requirement, it is denied without prejudice. The Court orders Elvia Irene Avila Perez to obtain an order appointing her as guardian ad litem or conservator before it can consider the petition.
