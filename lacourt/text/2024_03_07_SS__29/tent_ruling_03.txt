 Case Number:  21STCV36085    Hearing Date:   March 7, 2024    Dept:  29 Hearing for
Petition to Approve Compromise for Victoria De Silverio Avila (Age 20)
 
Tentative: 
 
Petitioner
filed the Petition and Order for Minor’s Compromise on February 7, 2024. 
 
The
Court has reviewed the petition filed by Petitioner Elvia Irene Avila Perez,
parent of Claimant, a disabled adult.
 
The
Court has also reviewed its file and does not see any order appointing
Petitioner as Claimant’s guardian ad litem. 
The petition states that there is no conservatorship for Claimant.
 
“The
guardian or conservator of the estate or guardian ad litem so appearing for any
minor, person who lacks legal capacity to make decisions, or person for whom a
conservator has been appointed shall have power, with the approval of the court
in which the action or proceeding is pending, to compromise.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 372(a)(3).)
 
Accordingly,
the petition is denied without prejudice. 

 
Before the
Court can consider the petition, the Petitioner must obtain an order appointing
her as guardian ad litem (or conservator). 
Moving party to give notice.
