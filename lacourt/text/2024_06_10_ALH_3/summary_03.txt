And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendant, San Marino Gardens Wellness Center, LP, in an unlawful detainer action brought by Park Marino Convalescent Center, Inc. The defendant argues that the plaintiff's notice to cure the alleged breach is defective because it does not specify that the defendant has three days to cure the breach. The plaintiff argues that the notice is sufficient because "court days" means days other than Saturdays, Sundays, and other judicial holidays. The judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff cannot cure the defective notice. The judge has also denied leave to amend the complaint to cure the defective notice.
