And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the defendant's motion to set aside the default and default judgment. The defendant, Jennifer L. Morse, failed to file a responsive pleading, which resulted in the default and default judgment. However, the court has found that the defendant's failure to file a responsive pleading constitutes excusable neglect due to the sudden passing of her mother in September 2023 and her need to grieve. The court has granted the defendant's motion and ordered her to file her proposed answer within 20 days. The court has also set a case management conference for a future date.
