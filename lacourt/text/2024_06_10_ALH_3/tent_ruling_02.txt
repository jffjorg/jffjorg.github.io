On July 18, 2023, plaintiff Ford Motor
Credit Company LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against defendant Jennifer
L. Morse (“Defendant”) for breach of contract, recovery of personal property,
and conversion. 
Defendant was personally served with
the summons and complaint on August 7, 2023. On September 15, 2023, Defendant,
as a self-represented litigant, filed a request to waive court fees. On
September 18, 2023, Defendant filed a motion for a 45-day extension to the
deadline to respond to the complaint. Defendant’s request for fee waiver was incomplete
and denied as such on September 19, 2023. She did not submit a revised request
nor did she pay the required court fees. Therefore, although her motion for an
extension was scheduled to be heard on December 4, 2023, it was taken off
calendar. 
On December 11, 2023, the clerk entered
default against Defendant. On March 8, 2024, the Court entered a default
judgment against Defendant. Also on March 8, 2024, Defendant filed a motion to
set aside the default and default judgment. The motion is unopposed. 
Defendant moves for an order setting
aside the default and default judgment based on inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b).
Discretionary relief from a default judgment and the entry of default is
available based on a showing of “mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable
neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) The application for
discretionary relief under CCP § 473(b) must be made “within a reasonable time”
and “in no case exceeding six months.” after entry of the default. (Id.)

Defendant does not contest the manner
of service and explains that at the time the lawsuit was commenced, she was the
sole caregiver of her mother who suffered from dementia and required
supervision at all times as well as assistance with all activities with daily
living. (Motion, Morse Decl., ¶ 10.) Defendant states that her mother passed
away on September 28, 2023, and was buried on October 5, 2023. (Ibid.) Defendant
states that she would like the opportunity to respond to this claim and
participate in settlement negotiations now that she is no longer responsible
for her mother’s caregiving and has had time to grieve. (Ibid.)
Defendant attaches a copy of her proposed answer and her mother’s death
certificate. 
Relief on the grounds of excusable
neglect may be granted if there is an act or omission that might be expected of
a reasonably prudent person under similar circumstances. (Zamora v Clayborn
Contracting Group, Inc. (2002) 28 C4th 249, 257.). (See Lasalle v. Vogel
(2019) 36 Cal.App.5th 127, 131-132, n. 4.) Here, Defendant has adequately
shown that the failure to file a responsive pleading (which caused the entry of
default on December 11, 2023) constitutes excusable neglect. Courts have
recognized excusable neglect in light of significant family emergencies
requiring immediate attention. Accordingly, the unopposed motion is GRANTED. 
The Court orders Defendant to file her
proposed answer within 20 days of the date of this hearing. The Court also sets
a Case Management Conference for ____________ at 8:30 a.m. in Department 3 of
the Alhambra Courthouse.
Dated
this 10th
day of June, 2024
