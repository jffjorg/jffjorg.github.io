And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has granted the Defendant's unopposed motion to set aside the default judgment. The Defendant had failed to respond to the complaint and was subsequently defaulted. However, the Defendant has shown that the failure to respond was due to excusable neglect, as she was the sole caregiver for her mother who had dementia and passed away. The Court finds that the Defendant's failure to respond was reasonable under the circumstances. The Defendant is ordered to file her proposed answer within 20 days of the date of this hearing. A Case Management Conference is set for [insert date] at 8:30 a.m. in Department 3 of the Alhambra Courthouse.
