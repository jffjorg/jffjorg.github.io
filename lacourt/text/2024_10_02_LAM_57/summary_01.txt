And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is preparing for a hearing on October 2, 2024, and is proposing voir dire questions to assess the knowledge and potential biases of the jurors. The questions will be posed to the first 18 jurors and cover topics such as their background, occupation, and any prior knowledge of the case or the parties involved. The court will also ask about their ability to follow the law, apply the same standards to all witnesses, and keep the case confidential. Additionally, the court will inquire about potential biases and whether any of the jurors have personal connections to the parties or the legal system. The goal of the voir dire is to select an impartial jury and ensure a fair trial.
