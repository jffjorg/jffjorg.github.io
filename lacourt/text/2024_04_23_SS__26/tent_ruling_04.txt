ANALYSIS: 
 
Plaintiff Samara A. Weiner (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant
action for recovery of COVID-19 rental debt against Defendants Century Property
Management & Investment, Inc. and Deion Gerhard (“Defendants”) on July 27,
2022. Defendants filed an answer and cross-complaint against Plaintiff, Art
Koomer, and Michael Koomer on November 23, 2022. Arthur Koomer and Michael also
filed cross-complaints against unnamed cross-defendants on May 18, 2023 and
June 30, 2023, respectively.
 
On December 18,
2023, the Court granted Defendants’ Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings with
respect to the Complaint with leave to amend. (Minute Order, 12/18/23.) On
February 5, 2024, the Court granted Defendants’ ex parte application and
dismissed Plaintiff’s Complaint against them with prejudice. (Minute Order,
02/05/24.) 
 
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for
Reconsideration on February 14, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
The Motion
is brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, subdivision (a),
which states in relevant part:
 
When an application for an order has been made to a judge, or
to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or granted
conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within 10 days
after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order and based
upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make application to the
same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the matter and modify,
amend, or revoke the prior order. The party making the application shall state
by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge, what
order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances,
or law are claimed to be shown.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd.
(a).) The Court lacks the jurisdiction to reconsider a prior ruling, on motion
of a party, where the motion does not comply with the requirements of Code of
Civil Procedure section 1008. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (e); Le
Francois v. Goel (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1094, 1106.) Additionally, there is a
diligence requirement: “Courts have construed section 1008 to require a party
filing an application for reconsideration or a renewed application to show
diligence with a satisfactory explanation for not having presented the new or
different information earlier.” (Even Zohar Construction & Remodeling,
Inc. v. Bellaire Townhouses, LLC (2015) 61 Cal.4th 830, 839.)
 
Plaintiff contends that new facts exist for reconsideration
of the ex parte application as follows: Plaintiff was not given notice of the
ruling on the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, dated December 18, 2023,
until the ex parte application to dismiss the Complaint was filed on February
2, 2024. (Motion, Weiner Decl., ¶¶6-8.) The Court, upon granting the Motion for
Judgment on the Pleadings, ordered Defendants to give notice. (Minute Order,
12/18/23.) Defendants incorrectly represented, in moving for ex parte relief,
that notice of the ruling on the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings was
waived. (Ex Parte filed 02/02/24, Lopez Decl., ¶4.) As Plaintiff points out,
notice would not have been waived because the Court took the matter under
submission and only later adopted the tentative ruling granting the Motion for
Judgment on the Pleadings with leave to amend. (Minute Order, 12/18/23, p. 1.)
This demonstrates that Plaintiff was not given notice of the ruling. 
 
Furthermore, Plaintiff presented this
argument regarding lack of notice in opposition to the ex parte application to
dismiss the Complaint but it does not appear that the opposition papers were
brought to the Court’s attention prior to the ruling was issued on February 5,
2024. Specifically, the opposition to the ex parte application was filed at
12:00 am on February 5, 2024. (Objection and Opposition, filed 02/05/24, p. 1.)
However, the Court’s order granting the ex parte application only noted the
filing of the moving papers. (Minute Order, 02/05/24, p. 1.) Plaintiff’s lack
of notice of the ruling granting the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is a
new, highly material fact of which the Court was unaware at the time the ex
parte application to dismiss the Complaint was heard and which warrants
reconsideration of the order dated February 5, 2024. Had the Court been aware
that Plaintiff did not have notice of the ruling granting the Motion for
Judgment on the Pleadings with 20 days leave to amend, it would not have
granted the ex parte application to dismiss the case.
 
Based on the foregoing, the ruling on the ex
parte application dated February 5, 2024 is vacated. The Court enters a new and
different ruling denying the ex parte application to dismiss the Complaint and
granting Plaintiff 20 days from this ruling to file an amended Complaint. 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Sara
Weiner’s Motion for Reconsideration is GRANTED. THE RULING ON THE EX PARTE APPLICATION DATED FEBRUARY 5, 2024 IS VACATED.
THE COURT ENTERS A NEW AND DIFFERENT RULING DENYING THE EX PARTE APPLICATION TO
DISMISS THE COMPLAINT AND GRANTING PLAINTIFF 20 DAYS FROM THIS RULING TO FILE
AN AMENDED COMPLAINT.
