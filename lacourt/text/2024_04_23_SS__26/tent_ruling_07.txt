 In
the Matter of Wenwing Yao, et al. PETITION
FOR DAMAGESANALYSIS:
 
On December 19, 2023, Petitioner Wenming Yao (“Petition”) filed the instant “Petition for Damages.”
However, the Petition does not seek monetary damages. Instead, it seeks
injunctive relief with respect to real property. (Pet., p. 1.) The limited
jurisdiction court lacks jurisdiction to issue the injunctive relief sought in
the Petition. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 85, 86.) 
 
Therefore,
the case is reclassified as an unlimited civil case and transferred to the
Reclassification/Transfer Desk for collection of fees and reassignment of the
case to an Independent Calendar Court. Petitioner is ordered to pay the
reclassification fee within ten (10) days.

 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
