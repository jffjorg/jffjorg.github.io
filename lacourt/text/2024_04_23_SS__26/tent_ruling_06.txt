 Case Number:  23NWLC06802    Hearing Date:   April 23, 2024    Dept:  26  Creditors Adjustment Bureau, Inc v. Lübel, et al.MOTION
TO DISMISS
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendant Daniel H. Lübel aka Dan H. Lubel aka Daniel Lubel aka
Daniel Lpbel aka Dan Lubel dba DL Builders’ Motion to Dismiss is DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
On March 13, 2023, Plaintiff Creditors Adjustment Bureau,
Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendant Daniel H Lübel aka Dan H
Lubel aka Daniel Lubel aka Daniel Lpbel aka Dan Lubel dba D L Builders
(“Defendant”) alleging causes of action for (1) breach of contract, (2) open
book account, (3) account stated, and (4) reasonable value. Defendant, in
propria persona, filed an Answer to the Complaint on May 19, 2023. 
 
On July 20, 2023, the Court determined that the matter was
not a collection hub case and reassigned it to Department 25 of the Spring
Street Courthouse. (Minute Order, 07/20/23.) The Court granted Plaintiff’s
discovery motions on November 8, 2023. (Minute Order, 11/08/23.) On December
22, 2023, Defendant filed the instant Motion to Dismiss. Plaintiff filed an
opposition on March 1, 2024. The Motion was set for hearing on March 21, 2024
but the action was then transferred to Department 26 of the Spring Street
Courthouse. (Minute Order, 03/21/24.) 
 
Discussion
Defendant’s moving papers do
not provide the Court with a sufficient legal basis or relevant authority to
dismiss the action. Plaintiff correctly cites that Code of Civil Procedure
section 1010 specifically provides that notice of a motion “must state … the
grounds upon which it will be made, and the papers, if any, upon which it is to
be based. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.) Additionally, Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1110(a) provides that a notice of motion, “must state in the opening
paragraph the nature of the order being sought and the grounds for issuance of
the order.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1110(a).) Defendant’s papers cite no
legal authority that gives the Court the authority to dismiss the case. 
 “The memorandum must contain a statement of
facts, a concise statement of the law, evidence and arguments relied on, and a
discussion of the statutes, cases, and textbooks cited in support of the
position advanced.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1113(b).) Indeed, Defendant’s
failure to provide a memorandum as required by the Rule is an “admission that
the [request] is without merit and cause for its denial.” (Cal. Rules of Court,
Rule 3.1113(a), (b); In re Marriage of Falcone & Fyke (2012) 203
Cal.App.4th 964, 976.)
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Daniel H. Lübel aka Dan H. Lubel aka Daniel Lubel aka
Daniel Lpbel aka Dan Lubel dba DL Builders’ Motion to Dismiss is DENIED.
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
