CLERK TO DOCKET NOTICE OF APPEAL AND FOR LEAVE TO PROCEED
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Respondent Alexander Gerwer’s Motion to Compel Clerk to
Docket Notice of Appeal and for Leave to Proceed is DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
Petitioner Anthem, Inc. (“Petitioner”) filed the instant
Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award on January 27, 2022. Respondent filed a
response on May 10, 2022. On June 2, 2022, the Court granted the Petition and
judgment was entered on June 14, 2022. Respondent filed an appeal of the
judgment, which was dismissed by the Appellate Division on July 24, 2023.
(Remittitur, filed 07/24/23, p. 6.) The Appellate Division also ruled that
Petitioner was entitled to recover its costs on appeal. (Ibid.)
 
Petitioner filed a memorandum of costs on August 23, 2023.
On October 13, 2023, Respondent filed a Motion for Reconsideration asking the
Appellate Division to reconsider its ruling allowing Petitioner to recover its
costs on appeal. The Appellate Division ruled that it lacked jurisdiction to
hear the Motion for Reconsideration on January 24, 2024.
 
Respondent filed the instant Motion to Compel Clerk to Docket Notice of Appeal and for
Leave to Proceed on March 28, 2028. Petitioner filed an opposition on April 4,
2024 and Respondent replied on April 19, 2024. 
 
Discussion
 
Respondent has not demonstrated
that this Court can compel the clerk to docket a notice of appeal. The Motion
cites only the California Rule of Court regarding the procedure for filing a
notice of appeal, Rule 8.821. The Rule does not speak to the Court authority to
compel the clerk to accept a notice of appeal for filing. Nor does Respondent
demonstrate that the notice of appeal was even filed; the Motion is supported
only by Respondent’s declaration claiming the notice of appeal was filed on
February 20, 2024, with no corresponding documentation. (Motion, Gerwer Decl.,
¶¶2-3.) The copy of the notice of appeal attached to the Motion does not bear
any filing stamp. (Id. at Exh. A., p. 1.) 
 
In the reply brief, Respondent
cites Code of Civil Procedure section 473 for relief from an order taken against him due to mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. This is different relief from what was
requested in the Motion, which only sought an order by this court that the
clerk docket the second notice of appeal. Nor does Code of Civil Procedure
section 473 give this court any such authority. 
 
Therefore, Respondent Alexander Gerwer’s Motion
to Compel Clerk to Docket Notice of Appeal and for Leave to Proceed is DENIED.
 
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
