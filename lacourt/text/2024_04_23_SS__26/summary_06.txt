And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to dismiss the case. The plaintiff, Creditors Adjustment Bureau, Inc., filed a complaint alleging causes of action for breach of contract, open book account, account stated, and reasonable value. The defendant, Daniel H. Lübel, filed an answer to the complaint and later filed a motion to dismiss. The court found that the defendant's motion lacked sufficient legal basis and failed to provide relevant authority to support the request to dismiss the case. The court cited California Code of Civil Procedure section 1010 and California Rules of Court rules 3.1110(a) and 3.1113(b) in support of its decision.
