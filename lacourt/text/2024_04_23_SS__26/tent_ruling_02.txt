ANALYSIS:  
 
Plaintiff Stephanie Storey
(“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action against Defendant Christopher R. Mandry
(“Defendant”) on July 13, 2021. Defendant filed an answer on March 9, 2022. On
November 22, 2023, the Court granted Defendant’s Motion to Compel Responses to
Request for Production of Documents, Set One. (Minute Order, 11/22/23.) Plaintiff
was ordered to serve code-compliant responses and pay sanctions of $760.00
within 20 days’ service of the order. (Ibid.)
 
Defendant filed the instant Motion for Evidentiary or
Terminating Sanctions on March 29, 2023. Plaintiff filed an opposition on April
9, 2024 and Defendant replied on April 16, 2024. 
 
Discussion
 
Where a party willfully disobeys a discovery order, courts
have the discretion to impose terminating, issue, evidence or monetary
sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.010, subds. (d), (g); R.S. Creative,
Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 495.) Contrary to
the opposition argument, Plaintiffs’ motion is supported by authority under
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030, which states in relevant part: “The
court may impose a terminating sanction by one of the following orders: 
 
(1)   An
order striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings of any party
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process.
 
(2)   An
order staying further proceedings by that party until an order for discovery is
obeyed.
 
(3)   An
order dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that party.
 
(4)   An
order rendering a judgment by default against that party.”
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d).) The court should
look to the totality of the circumstances in determining whether terminating
sanctions are appropriate. (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225,
1246.) Ultimate discovery sanctions are justified where there is a willful
discovery order violation, a history of abuse, and evidence showing that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with discovery rules. (Van
Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.) “[A] penalty as
severe as dismissal or default is not authorized where noncompliance with
discovery is caused by an inability to comply rather than willfulness or bad
faith.” (Brown v. Sup. Ct. (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 701, 707.)
 
Plaintiff does not provide an opposition memorandum, just a
declaration from counsel setting forth the following facts. Plaintiff’s counsel
admits to non-compliance with the Court’s November 22, 2023 order to produce
responses to the Request for Production of Documents, Set One. Plaintiff’s
counsel, however, takes the full blame for non-compliance on account of
numerous medical difficulties of his own, his mother, and his girlfriend.
(Opp., Mann Decl., ¶¶1-10.) Based on these circumstances, Plaintiff requests at
least another 45 days to produce documents. (Id. at ¶10.) The Court
agrees with Defendant’s reply that these circumstances cannot adequately
explain a failure to produce documents for almost a year, and that an
additional request for an extended continuance is inappropriate. There were
periods of time during which Plaintiff’s counsel could have followed up
regarding the records, including from January 2024 to the instant hearing date.
There is also no explanation of Plaintiff’s own oversight of her counsel’s
management, or lack thereof, of the litigation. 
 
That being said, the Court is inclined to provide a brief
extension of time for Plaintiff to produce the documents, after which
Defendant’s request for terminating sanctions will be granted immediately if
the records are not produced.  
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant
Christopher R. Mandry’s Motion for Sanctions is CONTINUED TO MAY 6, 2024 AT
10:00 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE. COUNSEL OF RECORD
FOR BOTH PARTIES ARE TO APPEAR AT THE HEARING. IF PLAINTIFF FAILS TO
DEMONSTRATE THAT THE DOCUMENTS SOUGHT IN THE REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION, SET ONE,
HAVE BEEN PRODUCED BY THE NEW HEARING DATE, THE COURT WILL GRANT DEFENDANT’S
REQUEST FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS.
