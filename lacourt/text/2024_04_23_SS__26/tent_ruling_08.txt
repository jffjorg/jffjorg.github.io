ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff iFab, Inc.
(“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action against Defendant The WCCD, Inc. (“Defendant
WCCD”) and Business Alliance Insurance Co. (“Defendant BAIC”) on September 1,
2023. On November 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Conditional Settlement.
On April 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant
Motion to Enforce Settlement, and Enter Judgment. To date, no opposition has
been filed. 
 
Legal Standard
 
The instant motion is brought under Code of Civil Procedure, section
664.6, which states in relevant part:
 
If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court
or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the
court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.
If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties
to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd.
(a).) Prior to January 1, 2021, “parties” under section 664.6 meant the
litigants themselves, not their attorneys. 
(Levy v. Superior Court (1995) 10 Cal.4th 578, 586.) The current
statute provides that “parties” includes “an attorney who represents the party”
and an insurer’s agent. (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (b).) The settlement
must include the signatures of the parties seeking to enforce the agreement,
and against whom enforcement is sought. (J.B.B. Investment Partners, Ltd. v.
Fair (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 974, 985.) Plaintiff has demonstrated the settlement agreement complies with
the statutory requirements set forth above as it was signed by both parties and
their attorneys. (Motion, Artunyan Decl., Exh. A, p. 4.)
 
The
settlement provides that Defendant WCCD would pay Plaintiff $24,000.00 through three
monthly payments of $8,000.00 by October 31, 2023, November 30, 2023, and December
15, 2023. (Id. at Exh. A, ¶1.) Total payments of $8,000.00 were made towards
the settlement, after which Defendant WCCD defaulted. (Id. at ¶3 and
Exh. B.) Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff is entitled to entry of judgment
against Defendant in the amount of $16,000.00 principal ($24,000.00 - $8,000.00).

 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff iFab, Inc.’s Motion to
Enforce Settlement Agreement is GRANTED. JUDGMENT TO BE ENTERED IN PLAINTIFF’S
FAVOR AND AGAINST DEFENDANT WCCD, INC. IN
THE AMOUNT OF $16,000.00 PRINCIPAL. 
 
PLAINTIFF IS TO FILE A REQUEST TO DISMISS DEFENDANT BUSINESS
ALLIANCE INSURANCE CO. AND A PROPOSED JUDGMENT WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
