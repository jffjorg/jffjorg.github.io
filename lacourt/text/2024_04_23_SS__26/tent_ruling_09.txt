ANALYSIS:
 
On October 16, 2023, Plaintiff John Comer (“Plaintiff”)
filed the instant action against Defendants NJS Construction Inc (“Defendant
NJS”) and Jack Saiege (“Defendant Saiege”). Following Defendant Saiege’s
failure to file a responsive pleading, the Court entered their default on
January 25, 2024. 
 
Defendant Saiege filed the instant Motion to Vacate Entry of
Default on March 25, 2024. Plaintiff filed an opposition on April 8, 2024 and
Defendant Saiege replied on April 16, 2024. The reply points out that the
opposition papers were not timely served and requests a short continuance to
allow for a response on the merits. 
 
The hearing on the Motion, therefore, is continued to May
29, 2024 at 10:00 am in Department 26 in the Spring Street Courthouse. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Jack Saiege’s Motion to Vacate Entry of Default is
CONTINUED TO MAY 29, 2024 AT 10:00 AM IN DEPARTMENT 24 IN THE SPRING STREET
COURTHOUSE. REPLY PAPERS ARE TO BE FILED AND SERVED PER THE CODE OF CIVIL
