And here is a brief English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration, vacating the previous ruling that dismissed the complaint with prejudice. The plaintiff did not receive notice of the ruling on the motion for judgment on the pleadings, and the ex parte application to dismiss the complaint was granted without notice being given to the plaintiff. The judge finds that these new facts warrant reconsideration of the order. The judge enters a new and different ruling denying the ex parte application to dismiss the complaint and grants the plaintiff 20 days from this ruling to file an amended complaint.
