And here is the English summary:

This tentative ruling denies Respondent Alexander Gerwer's Motion to Compel Clerk to Docket Notice of Appeal and for Leave to Proceed. The Judge finds that the Respondent has not demonstrated that the Court can compel the clerk to docket a notice of appeal. The Respondent's motion cites only the California Rule of Court regarding the procedure for filing a notice of appeal, but this rule does not speak to the Court's authority to compel the clerk to accept a notice of appeal. The Judge also notes that the Respondent's declaration claiming the notice of appeal was filed does not provide sufficient evidence, and the copy of the notice of appeal does not bear any filing stamp.
