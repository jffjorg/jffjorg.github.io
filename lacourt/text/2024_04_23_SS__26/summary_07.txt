And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reclassified the case as an unlimited civil case and transferred it to the Reclassification/Transfer Desk for collection of fees and reassignment to an Independent Calendar Court. The petitioner, Wenming Yao, had filed a petition for damages, but instead of seeking monetary damages, it sought injunctive relief with respect to real property. However, the limited jurisdiction court lacks the authority to issue such relief. As a result, the case has been reclassified and transferred, and the petitioner is ordered to pay the reclassification fee within 10 days.
