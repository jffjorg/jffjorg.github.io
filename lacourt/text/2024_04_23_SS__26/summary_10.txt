And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled that the defendants' demurrer to the complaint is sustained, meaning that the plaintiff's complaint fails to state sufficient facts. The demurrer was filed by the defendants, Janet Nazarian and AB Inspections, and the plaintiff, Gilberto Soto, had filed an opposition. The judge has given the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint to address the deficiencies. The judge has also overruled the demurrer based on res judicata, as the earlier small claims action between the plaintiff and defendant Nazarian does not apply to this case. The judge has also noted that the attachments to the complaint, which appear to be contracts between different parties, do not support the plaintiff's claims.
