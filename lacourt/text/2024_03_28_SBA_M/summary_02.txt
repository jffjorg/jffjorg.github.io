```

Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies, in part, the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay action. The court finds that the defendant has not met its burden to establish that the first through third, fifth, and sixth causes of action are subject to arbitration. The court rules that the arbitration clause is not enforceable for these causes of action because the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) does not contain a clear and unmistakable waiver of the right to pursue statutory claims in a judicial forum. The court also elects to delay its ruling with respect to the arbitration of the fourth cause of action because the adjudication of the nonarbitrable claims may make the ruling unnecessary.
