And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling by Judge Gary Y. Tanaka addresses the demurrer to the complaint and the motion to strike portions of the complaint filed by Kyle Bergstresser, et al. The court overruled the demurrer to the first cause of action for fraud and negligent misrepresentation, and denied the demurrer to the second cause of action for aiding and abetting fraud. The court also overruled the demurrer to the third cause of action for negligence and the fifth cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress.

The court granted Kyle Bergstresser's motion to strike portions of the complaint, but only in part, with 20 days leave to amend. The court denied the motion to strike paragraphs 13, 20, 36-41, 47, 48, 50, 52-54, 57, 58, and 63 of the complaint, as they are sufficiently supported with facts and are not on their face irrelevant, false, or improper.

The court also addressed the motion to strike paragraph 3 of the prayer for relief, which requested attorneys' fees, and granted the motion with 20 days leave to amend. The court held that the plaintiff failed to state a statutory or contractual basis for the requested attorneys' fees.

The court also held that the plaintiff's allegations and prayer for punitive damages are sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages, and that the defendant acted willfully, maliciously, intentionally, fraudulently, and/or recklessly.
