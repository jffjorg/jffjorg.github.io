EIAN BERON JR. 
  
        
  vs.
 
GAS MEDIA GROUP, LLC, et al. 
  


 Case
  No.:  21STCV20431  
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  November 25, 2024




 
Plaintiff’s
motion to strike Corporate Defendants’ answer to the TAC is GRANTED. 
 
On 6/1/2021,
Plaintiff Eian Beron, Jr. (Plaintiff) filed suit against Gas Media Group, LLA,
Keaton Keller, and Oombrella Enterprises (collectively, Defendants). On
7/18/2023, Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint. On 9/20/2023, Plaintiff
filed a third amended complaint (TAC) alleging: (1) breach of oral contract:
breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (2) breach of
implied-in-fact contract; (3) fraudulent concealment; and (4) breach of
fiduciary duty. 
 
            On
9/20/2024, Plaintiff moved to strike the answer of the unrepresented corporate
Defendants Gas Media Group, LLC and Oombrella Enterprises (Corporate
Defendants) 
 
Discussion 
 
            Plaintiff
argues that the answers to the TAC must be struck because the Corporate
Defendants have not been represented by counsel since 5/8/2024, and corporate
defendants are unable to appear in this proceeding in pro per.
 
            It
is established law that “under a long-standing common law rule of procedure, a
corporation, unlike a natural person, cannot represent itself before courts of
record in propia persona, nor can it represent itself through a corporate
officer, director, or other employee who is not an attorney. It must be
represented by licensed counsel in proceedings before the court of record.” (CDL
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1145.)

 
            Given
Corporate Defendants’ lack of representation, the Court agrees their answers
must be struck.
 
            Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion to strike Corporate Defendants’ answer to
the TAC is granted. Plaintiff may seek the entry of default.  
 
It is so ordered.
