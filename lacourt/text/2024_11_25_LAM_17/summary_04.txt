Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Kenneth Lopez, has filed a claim of exemption claiming that two of his retirement accounts, a traditional IRA and a SEP-IRA, are exempt from levy. The accounts have a balance of $420,523.45. The court has reviewed the evidence and finds that the amount in the accounts is not excessive and is necessary to provide for the support of the judgment debtor and his spouse and dependents. Therefore, the court grants the defendant's claim of exemption.
