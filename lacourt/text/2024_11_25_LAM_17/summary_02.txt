And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants in a lawsuit brought by Joshua and Lemor Greer against Kinga Lovasz, Management and Leasing Services, Inc., Ruth Friedman, and Lorraine Bases-Fermo. The lawsuit alleges various causes of action, including negligence, premises liability, and breach of warranty of habitability.

The Judge has sustained the demurrer as to the third cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress (NIED), finding that it is duplicative of other causes of action. The Judge has overruled the demurrer as to the second, fourth, and seventh causes of action, finding that they have sufficient allegations to state a claim.

The Judge has granted the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages, finding that it is insufficiently pled. The Judge has also granted the motion to strike with 20 days leave to amend.

The Judge's tentative ruling will be adopted as the final order unless all parties submit on the tentative and the court receives an email indicating that they are doing so.
