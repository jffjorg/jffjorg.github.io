Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case Gurmit Deol v. Safelite Group, Inc. The case concerns allegations by Deol that Safelite Group, Inc. violated the California Trap and Trace Law (Penal Code section 638.51) by using a software called TikTok on its website to gather personal information. The judge has sustained Safelite Group's demurrer, which means that Deol's complaint has been dismissed, and has given Deol 20 days to amend his complaint. The judge's ruling is based on the argument that Deol has failed to state a claim for violation of the law because he has not alleged that his personal information was actually collected, and because he has not alleged use of a pen register or trap and trace device. The judge also ruled that software does not constitute a "device" or "process" within the meaning of the law, and that Safelite Group is exempt from liability as a provider of an electronic communication service.
