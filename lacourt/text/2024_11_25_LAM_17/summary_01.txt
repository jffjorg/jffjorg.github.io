And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff's motion to strike the answers of the corporate defendants, Gas Media Group, LLC and Oombrella Enterprises, is granted. The corporate defendants have not been represented by counsel since May 8, 2024, and are unable to appear in this proceeding in pro per. The judge cites a California court decision that a corporation must be represented by licensed counsel in proceedings before the court of record. Therefore, the Court agrees that the Corporate Defendants' answers must be struck. The plaintiff may seek the entry of default.
