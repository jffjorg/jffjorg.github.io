Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion to quash service of summons filed by Chattem, Inc. (Defendant) on the grounds of lack of personal jurisdiction. The Plaintiff, Marque Routh, alleges that he developed mesothelioma as a result of exposure to asbestos, and that Chattem, Inc. is responsible for the injury. The Defendant argues that it is incorporated and headquartered in New Jersey, and that it has no contacts with California that would justify the exercise of jurisdiction.

The court has considered the evidence presented by both parties and has found that the Plaintiff has shown that he used Gold Bond, a product owned by the Defendant, in California from the 1990s to the 2000s. The court has also found that the Defendant has failed to establish that the exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable.

Based on the evidence presented, the court has denied the motion to quash service of summons and has found that it has personal jurisdiction over the Defendant. The court has ordered the parties to give notice of its ruling.
