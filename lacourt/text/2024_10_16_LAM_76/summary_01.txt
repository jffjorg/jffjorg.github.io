Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion for leave to engage in limited-expedited discovery against non-party deponents Google, Inc. and Instagram, LLC without prejudice. The Judge ruled that the Plaintiff must demonstrate a prima facie showing that a case for defamation exists and make reasonable efforts to provide notice of the attempt to lift the shield of anonymity. The Judge also emphasized that the Plaintiff must provide screenshots of the alleged defamatory messages to support their claims. The Judge's ruling is based on the principles of defamation law, including the requirement that a statement must be false, defamatory, and have a natural tendency to injure or cause special damage. The Judge also cited various California court cases to support their decision.
