## English Summary:

The judge is considering a motion by Plaintiff Yimei Wong to change previous orders that imposed sanctions on Defendant 1605 Armacost Inc. for failing to comply with discovery requests. Originally, the sanctions were ordered to be paid to Wong's former attorneys, LS Carlson Law PC. However, Wong is now representing herself in court and wants the sanctions paid directly to her. 

Defendant argues that Wong's motion is untimely, as it was filed close to the trial date. However, the judge noted that there are exceptions to the timeliness rule for discovery motions.

The judge ruled in favor of Plaintiff, modifying the previous orders to have the total sanctions amount of $12,241 paid directly to Wong. The judge also scheduled a hearing to address Defendant's continued failure to pay the outstanding sanctions.
