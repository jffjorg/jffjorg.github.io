## English Summary:

The judge is considering a motion by Plaintiff Yimei Wong to change previous orders that imposed sanctions on Defendant 1605 Armacost Inc. for failing to comply with discovery requests. Originally, the sanctions were ordered to be paid to Wong's former attorneys, LS Carlson Law PC. However, Wong is now representing herself in court and wants the sanctions paid directly to her. 

Defendant argues that Wong's motion is untimely, as it was filed close to the trial date. However, the judge noted that there are exceptions to the timeliness rule for discovery motions.

The judge ruled in favor of Plaintiff, modifying the previous orders to have the total sanctions amount of $12,241 paid directly to Wong. The judge also scheduled a hearing to address Defendant's continued failure to pay the outstanding sanctions.

**Roles:** Plaintiff Yimei Wong seeks to have sanctions paid directly to her. Defendant 1605 Armacost, Inc., et al., oppose Plaintiff's motion and have not paid the sanctions imposed in 2021 and 2022. Judge Edward B. Moreton, Jr., will rule on the motion and determine if Defendants will be held in contempt for failing to pay the sanctions.

**Significant Statements:** The Court modifies its prior orders so that sanctions in the total amount of $12,241 shall be payable directly to Plaintiff rather than her former counsel of record. The Court also sets an order to show cause on Defendants’ continued failure to pay sanctions imposed in 2021 and 2022, which will be heard on October 11, 2023, at 9:00 a.m.
