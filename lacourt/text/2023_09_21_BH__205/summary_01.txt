And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge, Edward B. Moreton, Jr., has issued a tentative ruling on a motion by Plaintiff Yimei Wong to modify the Court's prior sanctions orders. The motion is to pay the sanctions directly to the Plaintiff rather than her former attorneys, LS Carlson Law PC. The Court awarded monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,310 plus filing fees of $240 in December 2021 and in the amount of $8,691.00 payable by Defendant to Plaintiff's counsel of record in July 2022. However, the Defendant has not paid the sanctions to date. The Court modifies its prior orders to pay the total amount of $12,241 directly to the Plaintiff. The Court also sets an order to show cause on the Defendant's continued failure to pay sanctions imposed in 2021 and 2022.
