**Matter:** Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment or In the Alternative, for Summary Adjudication

---

**Summary:**

Judge Edward B. Moreton, Jr. issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Jane Doe 448’s motion for summary judgment or in the alternative, for summary adjudication. The motion was denied due to the following reasons:

1. **Oversize Brief:** The plaintiff's motion exceeded the 20-page limit set by the California Rules of Court. The court has discretion to disregard oversize briefs, which are treated the same as late-filed briefs.

2. **Failure to State Issues Verbatim:** The plaintiff sought summary adjudication of at least 21 issues, but failed to state each issue verbatim in the separate statement of undisputed material facts, as required by Rule 3.1350(b).

The ruling is denied **without prejudice**, allowing the plaintiff to file an amended motion that addresses these issues.
