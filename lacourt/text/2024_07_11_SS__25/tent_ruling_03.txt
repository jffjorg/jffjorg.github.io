 
BACKGROUND
 
On April
27, 2023, Plaintiffs Moises Cruz and Sandy Toribio (“Plaintiffs”) filed a Complaint
against Defendants Samo Enterprises, Inc. dba Western Motor Sport (“Samo
Enterprises” or “Samo”), JB Financial, a partnership consisting of Susan
Demirci and Igya Demirci (“JB”), and Hudson Insurance Company (“Hudson”)
(collectively, “Defendants”), alleging causes of action for: (1) violation of
the Consumer Legal Remedies Act (“CLRA”) pursuant to California Civil Code
section 1750 et seq.; (2) violation of California Business and
Professions Code section 17200 et seq.; (3) claim against dealer bond;
and (4) violation of Code of Civil Procedure sections 1281.97 and 1281.99. The
complaint arises from the sale of an allegedly defective used 2010 Chevrolet
Silverado 1500 (the “Subject Vehicle”). 
 
On May 11,
2023, Plaintiffs filed a Motion to Compel Arbitration and for the Court to Pick
Arbitration Forum and Request for Stay (the “Motion”), seeking an order compelling
Defendants Samo Enterprises and JB to arbitrate the controversy pursuant to the
Retail Installment Sale Contract (“RISC”). 
 
On June
23, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a Proof of Service indicating that Defendant JB had
been served with the summons, complaint, and Motion by substituted service. 
 
On June
23, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a Non-Service Report as to Defendant Samo
Enterprises which sets forth attempts to serve Defendant Samo Enterprises at
17477 Doric St., Los Angeles, CA 91344. 
 
On July
10, 2023, the Court issued a minute order noting that Plaintiffs had filed a
defective Notice of Motion, which did not list the address of the Spring Street
Courthouse, where the hearing on the Motion would take place. (See July
10, 2023 Minute Order.) Plaintiffs also failed to file proof that the moving
papers were served on Samo Enterprises or Hudson. (Id.) The Court
continued the hearing on the Motion to August 10, 2023 and ordered “Plaintiffs
to file and serve a corrected Notice of Motion and to serve all parties in the
case.” (Id.) 
 
On July
7, 2023, Plaintiffs filed and served a Notice of Continued Motion, listing the
Spring Street Courthouse Address. On July 7, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a Proof of
Service indicating that Defendant Hudson had been served with the summons,
complaint, and Motion. 
 
On July 19,
2023, Plaintiffs filed the Declaration of Nima Heydari in response to the
Court’s July 10, 2023, Order. 
 
On July
25, 2023, Defendant Hudson filed an Answer to the Complaint. 
 
On August
1, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a Non-Service Report as to Defendant Samo
Enterprises. 
 
On August
10, 2023, the Court continued the hearing on the Motion to allow Plaintiffs
additional time to serve Defendant Samo Enterprises with the Complaint and
moving papers. (See August 10, 2023 Minute Order.) The Court continued
the hearing on the Motion to November 8, 2023 and ordered Plaintiffs “to file
supplemental papers addressing the issues discussed [in the Court’s order] at
least 16 court days before the next scheduled hearing. Failure to do so may
result in the Motion being placed off calendar or denied.” (Id.) 
 
On
September 27, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a Non-Service Report as to Defendant Samo
Enterprises. 
 
On
September 28, 2023, Plaintiffs filed an Application to Serve Defendant Samo
Enterprises through the California Secretary of State (the “Application”). 
 
On
October 24, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a declaration from Nima Heydari re: an Order
to Show Cause as to Service of Defendant Samo Enterprises.  This declaration appears to be in response to
the Court’s August 10, 2023 Order. 
 
On
November 8, 2023, the Court continued the hearing on the Motion to allow
Plaintiffs additional time to serve Defendant Samo Enterprises with the
summons, complaint, and Motion. (11/08/23 Minute Order at p. 5.) The Court also
ordered Plaintiffs to file supplemental papers addressing any additional
service efforts on Defendant Samo Enterprises. (Id.) Additionally, the
Court ordered Plaintiffs to reserve a hearing date for their application for
service. (Id.) 
 
On
February 5, 2024, Plaintiffs’ counsel filed a supplemental declaration
regarding the issue of service on Defendant Samo Enterprises. On February 8,
2024, the Court, on its own motion, continued the hearing on the Motion to
April 4, 2024, and ordered Plaintiffs to serve and electronically file
supplemental papers addressing the issue of service of the Motion on Defendant
Samo Enterprises. (02/08/24 Minute order at pp. 5-6.) 
 
On March
8, 2024, the Court rejected Plaintiffs’ Application due to a defect in the
proposed order. 
 
On March
11, 2024, Plaintiffs’ counsel filed a supplemental declaration regarding the
issue of service on Defendant Samo Enterprises. 
 
On March
25, 2024, the Court, on its own motion, continued the hearing on the Motion to
June 6, 2024 so that Plaintiff could cure the defects in the Application.
(03/25/24 Minute Order at pp. 1-2.)  
 
On April
12, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an Application to Serve Defendant Samo
Enterprises through the California Secretary of State (the “2d Application”). 
 
On April 29, 2024, the 2d
Application was granted. 
 
On May 24, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a
proof of service showing that the summons, complaint, and the instant motion
were served on Defendant Samo Enterprises on May 21, 2024 via the California Secretary
of State. 
 
On May 28, 2024, Plaintiffs’
counsel filed a declaration in support of the Motion. In such declaration,
counsel requested a 30-day continuance on the motion given that Defendant Samo
was served by way of the California Secretary of State on May 21, 2024. 
 
On June 6, 2024, the Court
continued the hearing on the Motion to July 11, 2024 so that Defendant Samo
could be afforded the opportunity to file an opposition brief as the Motion was
served on Defendant Samo with less than 16 court days’ notice. (06/06/24 Minute
Order at pp. 5-6.) 
 
Also, on June 6, 2024, Plaintiffs
filed and served a Notice of Continued Motion to Compel Arbitration Hearing. 
 
MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
            Plaintiffs
contend that the controversy is covered by the arbitration provision in the
RISC. Plaintiffs assert that the parties do not agree on the forum of
arbitration. Plaintiffs indicate that they elect the American Arbitration
Association (“AAA”) or, in the alternative, JAMS as the arbitration forum. 
 
 
 
OPPOSITION
 
            None filed
as of July 8, 2024. 
 
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
I.          Compelling
Arbitration   
A.               
Legal Standard 
“A party who claims that there is a
written agreement to arbitrate may petition the superior court for an order to
compel arbitration” pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section
1281.2. Banner Entertainment, Inc. v. Superior Court (1998) 62 Cal.App.4th
348, 356. “California law, like federal law, favors enforcement of valid
arbitration agreements.” Armendariz v. Foundation Health Psychcare Services,
Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 83, 97. “On petition of a party to an arbitration
agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a
controversy and that a party to the agreement refuses to arbitrate that
controversy, the court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to
arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the
controversy exists, unless it determines that: (a) The right to compel
arbitration has been waived by the petitioner; or (b) Grounds exist for
rescission of the agreement.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1281.2.) A party opposing a
petition to compel arbitration “bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence any fact necessary to its defense.” Banner Entertainment,
Inc. v. Superior Court, supra, 62 Cal.App.4th 348, 356. 
Where a petition to compel arbitration
is granted, a court “shall, upon motion of a party to such action or
proceeding, stay the action or proceeding until an arbitration is had in
accordance with the order to arbitrate or until such earlier time as the court
specifies.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1281.4.)
B.        Discussion  
In support of the motion, Plaintiffs’
counsel, Kasra Sadr (“Sadr”), provides a declaration. Counsel attaches a copy
of the RISC to her declaration. (Sadr Decl., ¶ 3; Exh. 1.) On or about March 7,
2022, counsel’s office sent a pre-filing CLRA demand letter to Defendants Samo and
JB’s respective places of business on behalf of Plaintiffs, and the demand
included a demand for arbitration with the AAA. (Sadr Decl., ¶ 4; Exh. 2.)
Counsel did not receive any agreement to arbitrate or pay for the AAA initial
arbitration fees from Defendants Samo or JB before filing for arbitration.
(Sadr Decl., ¶ 6.) 
On or around June 21, 2022, counsel’s
office filed for arbitration with the AAA on behalf of the Plaintiff against
Defendants Samo and JB. (Sadr Decl., ¶ 7.) On or around August 16, 2022,
counsel’s office received a letter from the AAA which indicated that the AAA
decided to close its file because there was a previous failure of Defendant
Samo to comply with AAA policies. (Sadr Decl., ¶ 8; Exh. 3.) As such, counsel’s
office informed the AAA by email that it would like to proceed solely against
Defendant JB with the AAA. (Sadr Decl., ¶ 9.) On August 22, 2022, the AAA
accepted arbitration of the dispute between Plaintiff and Defendant JB and
demanded payment to be made by Defendant JB on or by September 4, 2022. (Sadr
Decl., ¶ 10; Exh. 4.) Due to Defendant JB not making the required payments by
the due date provided by the AAA, the AAA sent a letter indicating that it
declines to administer the arbitration. (Sadr Decl., ¶¶ 11-12; Exh. 6.) Counsel
states that the RISC, which was attached as Exhibit 1 to the Complaint, was
authenticated by Plaintiffs by way of an affidavit. (Sadr Decl., ¶ 13; Exh.
7.)  
The Court has reviewed the RISC. (Sadr
Decl., ¶ 3; Exh. 1.) The RISC was entered into between Plaintiffs and Defendant
Samo. (Id.) The RISC contains an arbitration provision therein which
states that “[a]ny claim or dispute, whether in contract, tort, statute or
otherwise . . . which arises out of or relates to . . . [the] purchase or
condition of this vehicle, this contract or any resulting transaction or
relationship (including any such relationship with third parties who do not
sign this contract) shall, at your or our election, be resolved by neutral
binding arbitration and not by court action.” (Sadr Decl., ¶ 3; Exh. 1 at p.
6.) The arbitration provision provides that Plaintiff “may chose the American
Arbitration Association . . . or any other organization to conduct the
arbitration subject to our approval.” (Id.)  
The Court finds that there is a valid
arbitration agreement between Defendant Samo and Plaintiffs, and that the
arbitration agreement covers the claims alleged in the Complaint. The Court
notes that the Court can compel Defendant JB to arbitrate as the Complaint
alleges that Defendant JB was assigned the RISC and is the holder of the RISC.
(Complaint, ¶¶ 39-40.) Defendant JB has failed to oppose the Motion and
therefore the Court finds that Defendant JB has conceded to Plaintiffs’
argument that it can be compelled to arbitration as “[c]ontentions are waived
when a party fails to support them with reasoned argument and citations to
authority.” Moulton Niguel Water Dist. v. Colombo (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th
1210, 1215.  
As to Defendant Hudson, the Court
notes that Plaintiffs are not seeking to compel the arbitration of Defendant
Hudson. Defendant Hudson is not a signatory to the RISC and Plaintiffs do not
present any authority to compel Defendant Hudson to arbitrate this
action.  
Plaintiffs indicate in the motion that
the parties disagree on the arbitration forum, but Plaintiffs elect the AAA or,
alternatively, JAMS as the arbitration forum. Given that the instant motion is
unopposed, the Court finds that Defendants do not take issue with the AAA
conducting the arbitration.
II.        Conclusion 
            
            Based on the foregoing, the Court therefore GRANTS
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Arbitration and orders arbitration of this matter
with the AAA. The Court STAYS this action pending the completion of
arbitration. (CCP § 1281.4.)  
 
            Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
