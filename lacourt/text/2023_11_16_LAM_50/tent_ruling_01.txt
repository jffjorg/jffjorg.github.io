TENTATIVE RULING
  RE: 
 
PLAINTIFF’S
  MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO PLAINTIFF’S REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION OF
  DOCUMENTS, SET FOUR, AND REQUEST FOR MONETARY SANCTIONS IN THE AMOUNT OF
  $10,260 AGAINST DEFENDANT AND/OR ITS COUNSEL
 



 
Background
Plaintiff Jason Dizon (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendant Western Asset Management Company, LLC (“Defendant”) on May
20, 2020. In the Complaint, Plaintiff asserts causes of action for (1)
retaliation in violation of Equal Pay Act, (2) whistleblower retaliation, (3)
retaliation in violation of FEHA, (4) retaliation in violation of Labor Code section 98.6, (5) discrimination on the
basis of association with protected group in violation of FEHA, (6) failure to
prevent discrimination and/or retaliation in violation of FEHA, (7) wrongful
termination in violation of public policy, and (8) unlawful prohibition on
discussing wages and working conditions.[1] 
On March 3, 2023, Plaintiff served his Fourth Set of
Requests for Production of Documents on Defendant. (Freeze Decl., ¶ 6, Ex. E.)
On April 4, 2023, Defendant served responses to Plaintiff’s Fourth Set of
Requests for Production of Documents. (Freeze Decl., ¶ 7, Ex. F.) Thereafter, counsel for
Plaintiff and counsel for Defendant engaged in meet and confer correspondence
regarding Defendant’s responses to Plaintiffs’ Fourth Set of Requests for Production of
Documents. (Freeze
Decl., ¶¶ 8-9.)  
Plaintiff’s counsel states that
“an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) was initially set for
July 5, 2023 but the Court and Defense counsel were unavailable,” and that
“[t]he IDC was continued to July 19, 2023.” (Freeze Decl., ¶¶ 15-16.) 
On July 19,
2023, and IDC was held in this matter. The Court’s July 19, 2023 minute order
provides, inter alia, as follows: 
 
“The parties
completed their Informal Discovery Conference requirement regarding the issues
set forth in the IDC Statement filed by Plaintiff on June 23, 2023. The parties
agreed and the Court orders them to meet and confer further regarding the
solutions discussed and the narrowing of the requests discussed. By August 31,
2023, defendant will inform Plaintiff as to any supplemental responses that
they are willing to serve. Plaintiff is to give notice.”[2] 
Plaintiff now moves for an order compelling
Defendant “to serve further verified code-compliant responses to Plaintiff’s
Requests for Production of Documents, Set Four, specifically, Nos. 103-131
within five (5) days of the hearing of this Motion.” Plaintiff also seeks
monetary sanctions against Defendant and its attorney of record. Defendant
opposes. 
Legal Standard¿ 
¿¿Code of
Civil Procedure section 2031.310, subdivision (a)¿ permits a propounding party to move for an order
compelling a further response to a demand for inspection if the propounding
party deems that a statement of compliance is incomplete, a representation of
inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive, or an objection is
without merit or too general. (¿Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (a)¿.) A motion to compel further
responses to a demand for inspection must set forth specific facts showing good
cause for the discovery sought and must be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration. (¿Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (b)¿.) 
“Except as provided
in subdivision (j), the court shall impose a monetary sanction…against any
party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel further response to a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (h).) 
Discussion 
A.    Procedural Issues 
            As an
initial matter, in the opposition, Defendant assert that “[t]he deadline to file
a Motion to Compel for Plaintiff’s Requests was July 7, 2023—a deadline that
Plaintiff was fully aware of and acknowledged in correspondence he sent to
[Defendant] on April 25, 2023…Plaintiff failed to file this Motion until July
17, 2023.” (Opp’n at p. 3:6-10.) 
            The Court notes that pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310, subdivision
(c), “[u]nless notice of this motion is given within 45 days of the
service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or on
or before any specific later date to which the demanding party and the
responding party have agreed in writing, the demanding party waives any right
to compel a further response to the demand.” As set forth above, Plaintiff
indicates that on
April 4, 2023, Defendant served responses to Plaintiff’s Fourth Set of Requests
for Production of Documents. (Freeze Decl., 7, Ex. F.) Forty-five days after
April 4, 2023 is May 19, 2023. 
            Defendant’s counsel states in her
declaration in support of the opposition that “[a]ttached as Exhibit B hereto
is a true and accurate copy of communication from Plaintiff’s counsel to prior
counsel for Defendant, acknowledging the July 7, 2023 deadline to file the
instant Motion…” (Ryan Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. B.) Exhibit “B” to Defendant’s counsel’s
declaration is a letter dated April 25, 2023 from Plaintiff’s counsel regarding
“Dizon’s Second Meet & Confer re Defendant’s Responses to Plaintiff’s
Requests for Production of Documents (Set 4).” (Ibid.)
The letter states, inter alia, that “[a]s a preliminary matter, this
confirms our agreement that you extended Plaintiff’s deadline to file his
Motion to Compel with respect to this set until July 7, 2023.” (Ibid.) As noted by Defendant, the instant
motion was filed on July 17, 2023. 
Defendant’s
counsel states that “[t]he deadline for Plaintiff to file a Motion to Compel on
his Requests for Production, Set Four, was July 7, 2023. Based on my review of
the record in this case and consultation with prior counsel, at no point did
Defendant agree to extend that deadline to any other date, including July 17,
2023, nor did Plaintiff seek an extension of that deadline from the Court.”
(Ryan Decl., ¶ 3.)  
            In the reply, Plaintiff asserts that
“Plaintiff’s Motion is timely as the parties agreed to extend the deadline for
filing the instant Motion to July 17, 2023. This agreement was accurately
documented by Plaintiff’s attorney, Ms. Freeze in her July 9, 2023 email to
Defendant’s counsel, requesting an extension from July 17 to August 1, 2023.”
(Reply at p. 3:26-4:2.) In support of this assertion, Plaintiff cites Exhibit J
to Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration in support of the instant motion. Exhibit
J is a “copy of email correspondences between [Plaintiff’s counsel] and Defense
counsel…” (Freeze Decl., ¶ 17, Ex. A.) Exhibit “A” includes a July 9, 2023
email from Plaintiff’s counsel stating “[i]n the meantime, since we are in the
process of rescheduling the IDC, would you agree to extend the deadline to file
Dizon’s motion to compel from July 17 to August 1, 2023?” (Ibid.) Plaintiff does not appear to provide
evidence of any response by Defendant’s counsel to Plaintiff’s request for an
extension. 
            Plaintiff asserts in the reply that
“Plaintiff made an inadvertent typo in his April 25, 2023 meet and confer
letter incorrectly stating the agreed deadline as July 7, 2023, instead of July
17, 2023.” (Reply at p. 4:2-4.) But Plaintiff does not provide any evidence to
support this assertion in connection with the motion or the reply. 
Moreover,
Plaintiff argues for the first time in the reply that the parties’ purported
agreement to extend the deadline to July 17, 2023 was “documented by
Plaintiff’s attorney, Ms. Freeze in her July 9, 2023 email to Defendant’s
counsel, requesting an extension from July 17 to August 1, 2023. See Exhibit J
attached to Declaration of Tamara Freeze in Support of The Motion.” (Reply at
p. 3:28-4:2.) As this specific argument was raised for the first time in the
reply, Defendant has not had the opportunity to respond to it. Thus, the Court is inclined to
give Defendant the opportunity to respond to such argument. 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, the Court continues the hearing on Plaintiff’s
motion to December 7,2023,¿ at 10:00 a.m. in Dept. 50.¿¿¿¿
Defendant may
file and serve a surreply on or before _December 1, 2023,¿pertaining to
the issue of whether Plaintiff was provided an extension to July 17, 2023 to
file the instant motion, with
a courtesy copy delivered to Dept. 50. Defendant may not include any argument
or evidence on any other issue.¿¿¿ 
Defendant is ordered to provide notice of this
ruling.
