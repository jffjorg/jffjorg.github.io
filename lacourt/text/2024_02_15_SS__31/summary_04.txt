And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants Walmart Inc.'s unopposed motion for summary judgment in a case filed by Martha Medina Navarro against Walmart Inc. and Moises Doe. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants allowed a liquid substance to remain on the floor, causing her to slip and fall on September 29, 2019. The defendants argue that there is no evidence of actual or constructive knowledge of the spill and that they inspected their floors regularly. The court finds that the defendants met their prima facie burden by showing that they inspected their floors and did not discover the spill, and therefore the burden shifted to the plaintiff to produce evidence showing a triable issue of material fact. Since the plaintiff did not oppose the motion, the court grants the motion for summary judgment.
