And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Hon. Michelle C. Kim, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Jerome Ovdin Dubose vs. Israel Alegria Morales, ET AL. (Case No. 22STCV14872). The case involves a motor vehicle accident and three causes of action for damages. The Defendant has moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the Plaintiff cannot establish his claims against them due to granted requests for admissions. The motion is unopposed. The Judge grants the motion, finding that the deemed admissions negate the essential elements of the Plaintiff's causes of action. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff cannot amend the complaint to state a claim against the Defendants. Therefore, the Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted without leave to amend.
