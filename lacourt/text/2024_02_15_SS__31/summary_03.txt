And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Arman Mesri's motion to set aside the dismissal of his action against defendants Ralph William Stephenson and Marionette Joy Murao. The Court finds that Plaintiff's counsel's admission of neglect and mistake resulting in the dismissal is sufficient to set aside the dismissal. The Court also sets an Order to Show Cause re: Dismissal for Failure to File Proof of Service, requiring Plaintiff's counsel to appear and provide evidence of service of the summons and complaint on the defendants. If Plaintiff fails to appear and file proper proof of service, the action may be dismissed.
