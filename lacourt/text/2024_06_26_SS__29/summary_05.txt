Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the motions filed by Defendant Frank Martin Scialpi to compel Plaintiff Efren Juarez-Lara to respond to Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Production. The Court finds that Plaintiff has already responded to the discovery requests, albeit with objections. The Court notes that an order compelling initial responses is not available in this case, as Plaintiff has provided some responses. Additionally, the Court notes that a party verification is not required for objection-only responses. Therefore, the Court DENIES the motions to compel initial responses.
