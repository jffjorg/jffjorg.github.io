And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendants' motion to compel the deposition of the plaintiff, Maria Serafin, is denied without prejudice. The judge found that the defendants failed to provide sufficient evidence to support their motion, including exhibits that were referenced in the declaration but not included in the court file. The defendants had noticed the plaintiff's deposition, but the plaintiff did not serve an objection or appear for the deposition. The defendants then inquired about the non-appearance, but received no response. The judge ruled that the defendants have a right to take the plaintiff's deposition under the California Code of Civil Procedure, but must make an adequate showing with supporting evidence in their motion.
