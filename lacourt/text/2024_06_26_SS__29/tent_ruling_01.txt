  Case Number:  20STCV29319    Hearing Date:   June 26, 2024    Dept:  29 Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative, for
Summary Adjudication
 
Tentative Ruling
 
The motion for summary judgment is denied.
 
Background 
 
On August
4, 2020, Ron A. Rosen Janfaza (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Katelynn
Tilley (“Defendant”), John Doe, Jane Doe and Does 1 through 50 for motor
vehicle negligence and general negligence arising out of an automobile accident
occurring on August 5, 2018, on the 170 Hollywood Freeway near Magnolia
Boulevard. 
Defendant
filed an answer on July 29, 2022.
When the
case was filed, the Court assigned a trial date of February 1, 2022 and a Final
Status Conference date of January 18, 2022. 
At the time of the Final Status Conference, Defendant had not yet appeared.  The Court set an OSC re entry of default and
a Trial Setting Conference for July 8, 2022. 
On January 8, 2022, Defendant still had not filed an answer, but she
appeared (in pro per) at the Court hearing. 
The Court continued the Trial Setting Conference to August 25, 2022.
On August
25, 2022, the Court set a trial date of October 20, 2023, and reset the
discovery deadlines based on the new trial date.  
On
September 29, 2023, the parties signed and submitted a stipulation to continue
the trial date to July 26, 2024, due to scheduling conflicts.  No discovery deadlines were extended.  The Court approved the stipulation on October
9, 2023.
On April
12, 2024, Defendant filed this motion for summary judgment or, in the
alternative, for summary adjudication. Plaintiff filed an opposition on June
12, and Defendant filed a reply on June 21.
Legal Standard
“The purpose of
the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut
through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their
allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil
Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), “requires the trial judge to grant
summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably
deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or
evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of
the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the
issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether
there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the
pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67,
citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367,
381-382.)
As to each cause
of action as framed by the complaint, a defendant moving for summary judgment
or summary adjudication must satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting
facts to show “that one or more elements of the cause of action ... cannot be
established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of action.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25
Cal.4th at pp. 850-851; Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Once the defendant has met that burden, the burden
shifts to the plaintiff to show that a “triable issue of one or more material
facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp.
850-851.)
A plaintiff or
cross-complainant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication must
satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to show “that there is
no defense to a cause of action if that party has proved each element of the
cause of action entitling the party to judgment on the cause of action.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) Once the plaintiff or cross-complainant has
met that burden, the burden shift to the defendant or cross-defendant to show
that a “triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of
action or a defense thereto.” (Ibid.)
The party opposing
a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication may not simply “rely upon
the allegations or denials of its pleadings” but must instead “set forth the
specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 437c, subds. (p)(1) & (p)(2). To establish a triable issue of
material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial
responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151,
166.)
Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of the
party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in
favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th
384, 389.)
Discussion
On
August 5, 2018, Plaintiff sustained injuries while riding in an automobile
driven by Defendant on the 170 Hollywood Freeway.  (Complaint, pp. 3-5; Defendant’s Statement of
Undisputed Material Facts [“DSUMF”], Nos. 1, 7; Declaration of Ron A. Rosen
Janfaza [“Plaintiff Decl.”], ¶¶ 2-4.)  As
Defendant drive northbound on the freeway, a shovel and ladder suddenly fell
off of the back of a pickup truck traveling directly in front of Defendant’s
car, and the shovel struck the windshield of the car. (DSUMF, Nos. 2-4,
17.)  The pickup truck did not stop, and
the driver has never been identified. (DSUMF, No. 5.)
At
the time of the accident, Defendant was driving her vehicle with the flow of
traffic.  (DSUMF, No. 14.)  Immediately before the shovel fell off the
truck, Defendant was driving her car in a safe and prudent manner.  (DSUMF, No. 15.)  Defendant did not cause the shovel or ladder
to fall off the truck.  (DSUMF, Nos.
16-17.)  
In
her motion for summary judgment, Defendant argues (among other things) that the
evidence obtained in discovery shows that Plaintiff cannot establish essential
elements of his cause of action, including that Defendant breached her duty of
care; that any breach by Defendant caused Plaintiff’s damages; or that
Defendant sustained any damages. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).)  Defendant also argues that Plaintiff is
seeking an impermissible double recovery by pursuing this lawsuit and a
separate uninsured motorist claim.
In his opposition, Plaintiff requests a
continuance of the hearing under Code of Civil Procedure section 437c,
subdivision (h).  That subdivision
provides:
“If it appears from the
affidavits submitted in opposition to a motion for summary judgment or summary
adjudication, or both, that facts essential to justify opposition may exist but cannot, for
reasons stated, be presented, the
court shall deny the motion, order a continuance to permit affidavits to be
obtained or discovery to be had, or make any other order as may be just.  The
application to continue the motion to obtain necessary discovery may also be
made by ex parte motion at any time on or before the date the opposition
response to the motion is due.” 
(Code Civ.
Proc., § 437c, subd. (h).) A summary judgment is a drastic measure which
deprives the losing party of trial on the merits. (Bahl v. Bank of
America (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 389, 395.) To mitigate this harshness,
the Legislature included a provision in section 437c that virtually mandates a
continuance under certain circumstances. (Id.)   
“The nonmoving party seeking a continuance must show: (1) the facts to
be obtained are essential to opposing the motion; (2) there is reason to
believe such facts may exist; and (3) the reasons why additional time is
needed to obtain these facts.” (Wachs v. Curry (1993) 13
Cal.App.4th 616, 623.) Where the opposing party submits an adequate
affidavit showing that essential facts may exist but cannot be presented in a
timely manner, the Court must either deny summary judgment or grant a
continuance. (Dee v. Vintage Petroleum, Inc. (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th
30, 34-35.)   
To support his request for a continuance, Plaintiff submits a
declaration from his counsel stating that Plaintiff contends that Defendant is
at least partially at fault for the accident and that the deposition of
Defendant is essential discovery that must be conducted before the summary
motion can be adjudicated.  (Declaration
of Ilan N. Rosen Janfaza [“Counsel Decl.”], ¶¶ 3-6.)  According to counsel, Plaintiff has been
attempting to take the deposition of Defendant “since September of 2023.”  (Id., ¶ 3.) 
The deposition was initially noticed for September 8, 2023; Defendant
did not appear; and the deposition has now been renoticed for June 25,
2024.  (Ibid.)
This declaration from counsel is not sufficient to support a statutory
request for a continuance under section 437c, subdivision (h).  Nowhere does counsel explain why additional
time is needed to take this deposition, or why it was not taken sooner.  Defendant answered the complaint in July
2022, and the discovery cutoff was in September 2023.  Plaintiff had approximately 14 months to take
this deposition prior to the fact discovery cutoff.  For whatever reason (not explained by
counsel), the deposition was not noticed until 12 days before the cutoff.  And when it did not go forward, Plaintiff
took no action to compel the deposition, as Plaintiff could have done.
But the absence of explanation does not end there.  Defendant filed this motion for summary
judgment on April 12.  Plaintiff’s
opposition was due on June 12.  Plaintiff
had two months to depose Plaintiff (either by stipulation to take discovery
after the discovery cutoff or by filing a motion or application to reopen
discovery for the purpose of proceeding with the deposition).  Instead of doing so, Plaintiff noticed the
deposition for June 25, after the due date for his opposition, and only one day
before the hearing.
Plaintiff has not explained why additional time is needed to gather the
evidence in this case.  For that reason,
the request for a statutory continuance is denied.
Even when a party has failed to establish a
statutory right to a continuance under Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, however,
the Court has discretion to grant a continuance on a showing of good cause. (Cooksey
v. Alexakis (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 246, 254); Hamilton v. Orange County
Sheriff’s Dept. (2017) 8 Cal.App.5th 759; 765; Lerma v. County of Orange
(2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 709, 711-712; Chavez v. 24 Hour Fitness USA, Inc. (2015)
238 Cal.App.4th 632, 643-644.) In ruling on a request for a continuance, the Court can consider a variety
of factors, including (1) how long the case has been pending; (2) how
long the requesting party had to oppose the motion; (3) whether the continuance
motion could have been made earlier; (4) the proximity of the trial date
or the 30-day discovery cutoff before trial; (5) any prior continuances for the
same reason; and (6) the question whether the evidence sought is truly
essential to the motion. (Chavez, supra, 238 Cal.App.4th at p. 644; 3 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide:
Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023) ¶ 10:208.1.) 
The Court has considered
these factors and determines, on balance, that they weigh against a finding of
good cause for a discretionary, non-statutory continuance.  Plaintiff’s unexplained delay in seeking this
discovery, the long time that was available for Plaintiff to take the
deposition prior to the discovery cutoff, the 60-day period between the filing
of the motion and the due date for the opposition, the fact that discovery
closed approximately nine months ago, and the proximity of the trial date all weigh
heavily against the request. 
Having rejected the request
for a continuance of the hearing, the Court now turns to the merits.  
Defendant, as the party
moving for summary judgment, the initial burden of presenting facts showing “that one
or more elements of the cause of action ... cannot be established.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).)  On this record, Defendant has not done so.
To
be sure, Defendant has shown that any injury to Plaintiff occurred after a
shovel and ladder suddenly fell off of the back of a pickup truck traveling
directly in front of the car driven by Defendant, in which Plaintiff was a
passenger, and the shovel struck the car’s windshield. (DSUMF, Nos. 2-4, 17.)  Defendant did not cause the shovel or ladder
to fall off the truck.  (DSUMF, Nos.
16-17.)  And immediately before the
shovel fell off the truck, Defendant was driving her car in a safe and prudent
manner.  (DSUMF, No. 15.)  Plaintiff has admitted that these facts are
all true.
But
this evidence does not tell us whether Defendant did or did not act with due
care when the shovel and ladder fell off of the truck in front of her car.  It certainly does not show that Plaintiff
cannot establish that she breached her duty of care during this short period of
time, or that any such breach was not a substantial factor in causing (in whole
or in part) Plaintiff’s injuries.  To the
contrary, Plaintiff denied Defendant’s request that Plaintiff admit that
Defendant acted with due care after the shovel fell off of the truck and denied
Defendant’s request that Plaintiff admit that Defendant did not cause the
accident.  (See DSUMF, Nos. 18-19, 25-26
and supporting evidence.)
Defendant
argues that “factually devoid” discovery responses may be cited on summary
judgment to show that a party cannot establish one or more elements of a cause
of action.  That is absolutely true as a
statement of the law.  But it does not
apply here.  Plaintiff did not provide
factually devoid discovery responses. 
Instead, Plaintiff asserted objections to Defendant’s discovery
requests.  (See DSUMF, Nos. 20-22, 24 and
supporting evidence.)  If some or all of those
objections were without merit – which may well be the case – then Defendant’s
remedy was to bring a motion to compel a further response under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2030.300, subdivision (a)(3) (for the interrogatories) and
section 2031.310, subdivision (a)(3) (for the document requests).  Objections – even those that may have little
merit – are not the same as “factually devoid” discovery responses for purposes
of section 437c.  (See Bayramoglu v.
Nationstar Mortgage (2020) 51 Cal.App.5tha 726, 734-735 [improper exercise
of option to produce documents in response to interrogatory under section
2030.230 not treated as “factually devoid” discovery response for purposes of
motion for summary judgment]; Gaggero v. Yura (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 884,
893-894 [same for improper objection and refusal to answer].)  The Civil Discovery Act provides various
sanctions for asserting objections that are without merit; none of those
sanctions include the entry of summary judgment on the opposing party’s motion.
Defendant’s
final argument in her motion fares no better. 
Plaintiff cannot recover twice for the same injury, but there is nothing
improper in Plaintiff seeking to recover from multiple sources for his injuries.
In
sum, Defendant has not carried her initial burden as the party moving for
summary judgment of showing that one or more of the elements of Plaintiff’s
causes of action cannot be established.  To
the contrary, on this record, there are triable issues of fact as to breach,
causation, and damages.  Accordingly, the
motion is denied.
Conclusion
The Court
DENIES Defendant’s motion for summary judgment.
 
Moving
Party is ORDERED to give notice.
