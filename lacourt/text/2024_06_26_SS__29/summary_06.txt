And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Linda McLean's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against co-defendant Rochelle Linnetz. The motion is continued for approximately 30 days to allow Linnetz to be served with the motion and to be heard. The cross-complaint seeks contribution, indemnity, and declaratory relief based on the same set of facts as the plaintiff's complaint. However, the Court cannot grant the motion at this time because Linnetz has answered the complaint and appeared in the action, but was not served with the motion. The Court will reconsider the motion after 30 days, pending Linnetz's service and response.
