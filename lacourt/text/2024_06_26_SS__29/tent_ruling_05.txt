Background
On September 1, 2022, Efren Juarez-Lara
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Frank Martin Scialpi (“Defendant”) and
Does 1 through 100, asserting causes of action for premises liability and
general negligence arising out of an incident on or about September 3, 2020, in
which Plaintiff was injured while working on Defendants’ premises.
Defendant filed an answer on January 18,
2024, and an amended answer on March 1, 2024.
On January 8, 2024, Defendant served Plaintiff
with discovery, including Form Interrogatories (Set One), Special
Interrogatories (Set One), and Requests for Production (Set One).  (Todd Decls., ¶ 2 & Exhs. 1.)  After requesting and receiving a series of
extensions of time to respond, Plaintiff served responses on April 17,
2024.  (Id., ¶ 8 & Exhs. 8.)  The responses were essentially all objections,
except for in response to Form Interrogatories 1.1, 2.1, and 2.2.  (Id., ¶ 8 & Exhs. 8.)  No verifications were provided.  (Id., ¶ 9.)  Plaintiff also produced more than 10,000
pages of medical records that, according to counsel, were “not labeled or
organized in any fashion.”  (Id., ¶ 8.)
On May 21, 2024, Defendant filed these three
motions: (1) motion to compel Plaintiff to respond to Form Interrogatories; (2)
motion to compel Plaintiff to respond to Special Interrogatories; and (3)
motion to compel Plaintiff to respond to Requests for Production. Plaintiff
filed a combined opposition on June 12.  Defendant
filed three replies on June 20.
Legal Standard
A party must
respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd.
(b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no
meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition,
a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves
to compel initial responses to interrogatories, “the court shall impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (c).)
A party must
respond to requests for production of documents within 30 days after service.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for
production of documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the
requesting party may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (Id.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., §
2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
requests for production, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(c).)
Requests for admission may be propounded on a party without leave of court 10
days after the service of the summons on, or appearance by that party,
whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.020(b).)
In
Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010,
subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include
“[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd. (a).)
Discussion
Defendant served Plaintiff with discovery,
including Form Interrogatories (Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set One),
and Requests for Production (Set One). 
(Todd Decls., ¶ 2 & Exhs. 1.) 
Plaintiff served responses on April 17, 2024.  (Id., ¶ 8 & Exhs. 8.)  Plaintiff objected to every discovery request;
in response to three basic form interrogatories (Nos. 1.1, 2.1, and 2.2),
Plaintiff included objections and a substantive response.  (Id., ¶ 8 & Exhs. 8.)  No verifications were provided.  (Id., ¶ 9.)  
Defendant moves for an order under Code of Civil Procedure
sections 2030.290 and 2031.300 compelling Plaintiff to provide initial
responses to the discovery.  The motions are DENIED.  Plaintiff has
responded.  If Defendant contends that the objections lack merit, the
Civil Discovery Act provides a remedy (a motion to compel further responses) under
sections 2030.300 (for interrogatories) and 2031.310 (for requests for
production), subject to certain procedural requirements.  In this context,
an order compelling initial responses under sections 2030.290 and 2031.300 is
not available.
Moreover, as to the responses to the Special Interrogatories and
Request For Production, the Court notes that a party verification is not required for
objection-only responses.  (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.250, subd. (a) & 2031.250, subd. (a).)
Conclusion
The Court DENIES Defendant’s
motions to compel Plaintiff to provide initial responses
to Form Interrogatories (Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set One), and
Requests for Production (Set One). 
Moving party is ORDERED to give
notice.
