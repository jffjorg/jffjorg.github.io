Erick B. Novik, Esq. and Kevin Salute, Esq.
 
Tentative
 
The motion is denied without prejudice.
 
Background
On September 29, 2021, Raquel Salomon
(“Plaintiff”) filed a  complaint against
City of Los Angeles, 7353 Milwood Avenue, Elkana Arik Aharoni aka Arik Aharoni
for general negligence and premises liability causes of action arising out of a
trip and fall on the sidewalk at 7353 Milwood Avenue in Canoga Park, CA on
October 19, 2020. On August 31, 2022, Plaintiff filed the first amended
complaint against the same defendant for the same causes of action. 
On February 2, 2023, City of Los Angeles
filed an answer and cross-complaint against Arik Aharoni and 7353 Milwood
Avenue for indemnification, apportionment of fault, and declaratory relief.
On May 24, 2024, Erick
B. Novik, Esq. and Kevin Salute, Esq. of Novik Law Group (“Counsel”)
filed this motion to be relieved as counsel. No opposition has been filed. 
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial
Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.136(c)), and
MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
Counsel has
filed the Notice, Declaration and Order to be Relieved as Counsel. 
 
There are issues,
however, regarding service.  The
Declaration of Counsel (mandatory Form MC-052) states, in Item 3(b)(1)(d) that Counsel
has confirmed the client’s address within the past 30 days.  But in Attachment 2 to the Declaration,
paragraphs 6 through 9 indicate that Counsel has had no communication at all with
the client for more than two years, and that the so-called “current address” is
an apartment building that has been demolished and is now an empty lot.  
 
Both of these
things cannot be true.  
 
Assuming that
the statements in Attachment 2 are correct, Counsel has not served the client,
as is required.
 
Accordingly, the
motion is DENIED without prejudice.
Conclusion
The Court DENIES
Counsel’s motion to be relieved.
Moving Counsel
to give notice.
