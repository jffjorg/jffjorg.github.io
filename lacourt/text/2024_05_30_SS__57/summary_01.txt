And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has sustained the demurrer to the fraud claim with leave to amend, and sustained the demurrer to the negligence claim without leave to amend. The demurrer is sustained as the Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint (SAC) lacks specific allegations of misrepresentations and fails to show when, where, to whom, and by what means representations were tendered. The court is giving the Plaintiff an opportunity to clarify the relationship between the parties and the specific misrepresentations made. The court has also sustained the demurrer to the negligence claim as the Plaintiff has not pled any duty in tort that the Moving Defendants owed it and has not pled any such duty was breached.
