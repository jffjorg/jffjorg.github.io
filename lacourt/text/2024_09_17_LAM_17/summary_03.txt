Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Cynthia Lopez's motion for an order of assignment against Defendant Kenneth Lopez. The motion is continued to allow for supplemental materials to be filed. The Plaintiff seeks an order directing the Defendant to assign payments made by Solidifi U.S. Inc to the Plaintiff. The Court has determined that it cannot evaluate the Defendant's contention that he depends on all income for living expenses due to a lack of corroborating evidence. The Defendant is directed to submit all necessary documentation to corroborate his financial statement claims. The Court will adopt this tentative as the final order if all parties submit and there are no appearances at the hearing.
