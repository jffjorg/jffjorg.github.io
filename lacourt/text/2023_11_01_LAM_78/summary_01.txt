And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling denies Plaintiff Jeffrey Ito's motion to vacate judgment. The motion was filed after the Court granted Defendants' Anti-SLAPP motion to strike on July 27, 2023. The Plaintiff claims that the restraining order was falsified and that the Defendants are spreading malicious falsehoods about him. The Court found that the Plaintiff's claim for defamation arose from the filing of a restraining order, which is a protected activity. The Plaintiff failed to provide admissible evidence showing he was likely to succeed on the merits of his claim. The Court concludes that the Plaintiff's motion to vacate judgment is denied.
