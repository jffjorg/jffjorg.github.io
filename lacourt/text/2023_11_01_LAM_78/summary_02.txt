And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion for summary judgment in an unlawful detainer action brought by BLVD FOODS LLC against THE CHICKEN KOOP LLC. The plaintiff seeks to terminate the lease and recover unpaid rent and damages. The defendant has defaulted on its rent payments and failed to pay rent or quit the premises. The plaintiff's evidence shows that the defendant is in possession of the premises without permission and that the plaintiff properly served a 10-day notice to pay rent or quit. The defendant argues that the notice was not served according to the lease and that it did not receive the notice. The court finds that there are triable issues of material fact regarding the notice requirements and the defendant's receipt of the notice, and therefore, the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is denied.
