And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a Tentative Ruling in the matter of Angela Shalome Streat Wilson v. The Regents of the University of California. The Plaintiff seeks to amend the complaint to reassert an elder abuse cause of action and seek punitive, exemplary, and treble damages. The Defendant opposes the motion, arguing that the Plaintiff has unreasonably delayed in bringing the motion and that the amendment would result in prejudice.

The Court finds that the Plaintiff has demonstrated that she discovered new facts that Defendant failed to keep a constant line of sight on Plaintiff, which resulted in Plaintiff eloping from the hospital and being struck by a car and killed on December 21, 2023. The Court grants the Plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the complaint.

Additionally, the Court finds that Megan Frilot, the daughter of the decedent, has satisfied all criteria to continue litigating as the Plaintiff's successor in interest. The Court grants Ms. Frilot's request to continue litigating as the Plaintiff's successor in interest.

The Court will continue the hearing to allow for additional briefing on the issue of Plaintiff's successor in interest.
