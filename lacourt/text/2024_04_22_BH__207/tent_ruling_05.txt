SC129270




MATTER:  


Request for Default Judgment



 
On August 8, 2023, Defendants and Cross-Complainants Emaar LA
Properties, LLC and EJL Homes Realty & Construction, Inc. (“Cross-Complainants”)
filed a first amended cross-complaint (“FACC”) against Plaintiffs and
cross-defendants James Lee dba JCL Contractors (“Lee”) and JCL Contractors,
Inc. (“JCL” or “Cross-Defendant”) stemming from a dispute over a construction
contract.  Lee was dismissed on August
18, 2023.
 
Cross-Complainant now requests default judgment against
Cross-Defendant JCL in the amount of $1,349,221.75, which is
composed of general damages in the amount of $770,510.61; prejudgment interest
in the amount of $486,374.40; costs in the amount of $22,395.68; and attorneys’
fees in the amount of $69,941.06.
 
            a.         Damages 
 
            The
Cross-Complaint alleges five causes of action for (1) Breach of Written
Contract; (2) Breach of Express Warranty; (3) Breach of Implied Warranies; (4) Negligence;
and (5) Declaratory Relief. Cross-Defendant was served with a copy of the
summons and complaint via substitute service on August 14, 2023. Default was
entered against Cross-Defendant on September 26, 2023, and the Roe defendants
were dismissed on March 27, 2024. 
 
            However,
the Cross-Complaint does not specify what damages are sought.  The Court cannot award damages that are in
excess of what is pled in the Complaint. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 580, subd. (a)
[“The relief granted to the plaintiff, if there is no answer, cannot exceed
that demanded in the complaint”]; Levine v. Smith (2006)
145 Cal.App.4th 1131, 1136-1137 [“when recovering damages in a default
judgment, the plaintiff is limited to the damages specified in the complaint”].)  
 
            Therefore, the Court cannot award
Cross-Complainant’s requested damages.
 
c.         Prejudgment
Interest 
 
            Because
Cross-Complainant has not demonstrated entitlement to the requested damages,
the Court similarly cannot award prejudgment interest on the requested damages.
            
            d.         Attorney Fees and Costs 
 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 1033.5, which outlines recoverable costs to a prevailing party under
Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, permits the recovery of attorneys’ fees
when authorized by contract, statute, or law. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(10).)  Code of Civil Procedure section 1021 provides
“[e]xcept as attorney’s fees are specifically provided for by statute, the
measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law is left to
the agreement, express or implied, of the parties [….]”  Similarly, Civil Code section 1717 provides
“[i]n any action on a contract, where the contract specifically provides that
attorney’s fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract, shall
be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then the
party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract, whether he
or she is the party specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to
reasonable attorney’s fees in addition to other costs.”  (Civ. Code, § 1717, subd. (a).)
 
The Code of Civil Procedure defines the “prevailing party” as follows:

 
[T]he party with a net monetary recovery, a defendant in whose favor a
dismissal is entered, a defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains
any relief, and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any
relief against that defendant. If any party recovers other than monetary relief
and in situations other than as specified, the “prevailing party” shall be as
determined by the court, and under those circumstances, the court, in its
discretion, may allow costs or not and, if allowed, may apportion costs between
the parties on the same or adverse sides pursuant to rules adopted under
Section 1034.
 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).)
            
            Paragraph 14.1.9
of the contract provides:
 
UPON AN EVENT OF DEFAULT, […] TRADE
CONTRACTOR SHALL BE LIABLE TO CONTRACTOR FOR ANY AND ALL LOSS, DAMAGE OR
EXPENSE, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY SUFFERED BY CONTRACTOR FROM SUCH EVENT OF
DEFAULT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, REASONABLE ATTORNEYS' FEES INCURRED OR
PAID BY CONTRACTOR.
 
(Exhibit 1.)     
 
            Cross-Complainants
seek attorneys’ fees pursuant to Local Rule 3.214, which provides for cases
valued over $100,000, reasonable attorneys’ fees are $2,890 plus 1% of the
excess over $100,000.  Here, that amounts
to $9,595.11, yet Cross-Complainants seek $69,941.06, due to a mathematical
error in calculating 1% of $670,510.61, which is $6,705.11, not
$67,051.06.  (See Lee Decl. ¶ 13.)  Therefore, the Court cannot award the
requested attorneys’ fees.
 
            Plaintiff also requests $22,395.68 in costs composed of $2,193.25 in filing fees, $222.52 in process server fees, and $19,979.91
in unspecified “other” costs.  (CIV-100.)
 Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5
outlines the allowable and disallowable costs under section 1032.  Because Cross-Complainants have not specified
what the $19,979.91 in “other” costs were, the Court cannot analyze whether the
requested costs are proper.
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Cross-Complainants’
request for default judgment is denied.
