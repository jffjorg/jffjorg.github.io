And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendant, Pamela Chen, to the third and fourth causes of action in the complaint filed by the plaintiffs, Steven Gryczman and Susan Gryczman. The defendant demurred to the causes of action alleging breach of fiduciary duty and negligence, arguing that as a member of the homeowners' association board, she owes no fiduciary duty to the individual homeowners. The plaintiffs argue that the defendant violated the covenants, conditions, and restrictions of the homeowners' association by personally concealing repair proposals from the plaintiffs. The court finds that the defendant's demurrer is without merit and overrules it. The court orders the defendant to file an answer to the complaint on or before May 13, 2024.
