And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a tentative ruling on a dispute regarding an arbitration agreement. The plaintiff is challenging the agreement as unconscionable, but the judge is considering whether this challenge is directed at the agreement as a whole or specifically at the delegation clause. If the challenge is to the agreement as a whole, the delegation clause will be severed and enforced, leaving the arbitrator to determine the enforceability of the agreement. However, if the challenge is specifically to the delegation clause, the court must first determine whether that clause is enforceable before delegating the issue to the arbitrator. The judge is also considering whether the inclusion of MBUSA as a third-party beneficiary satisfies the test outlined in Goonewardene, which would allow the arbitrator to determine the enforceability of the agreement.
