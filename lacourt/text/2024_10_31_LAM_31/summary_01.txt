And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion by Defendant Cesar Rodriguez to set aside the judgment and default entered against him in a landlord-tenant dispute. Rodriguez was served with the summons and complaint, but the court finds that he has rebutted the presumption that service was proper. As a result, the default is vacated, and Rodriguez's proposed answer is deemed filed. The court directs Rodriguez to separately file his answer with the court within five days.
