MOTION
TO SET ASIDE JUDGMENT AND DEFAULT 



 
MOVING
PARTY:              Defendant Cesar Rodriguez
 
RESPONDING
PARTY:     Plaintiffs Noemi Alegria, et al. 
 
 
            This is a landlord-tenant dispute.  On November 30, 2023, Plaintiffs Noemi
Alegria and minors Joseph Rivera, Abraham Rivera, Amri Rivera and Johnny
Picazo, by and through their guardian ad litem, Noemi Alegria (collectively,
Plaintiffs) filed a Complaint against Defendants Cesar Rodriguez (Rodriguez)
and Santiago Reyes (Reyes) for (1) Breach of Implied Warranty of Habitability
(2) Breach of Statutory Warranty of Habitability, (3) Breach of the Covenant of
Quiet Enjoyment, (4) Negligence, (5) Violation of Civil Code §1942.4, (6) Private
Nuisance, (7) Violation of Tenant Anti-Harassment Ordinance, and (8) Violation
of Unfair Competition Law (Bus. & Prof. C. §§ 17200-09).  Plaintiffs were tenants in a property owned
and managed by Defendants Rodriguez and Reyes. 
 
On January 19, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a Proof of Service of
Summons showing that Rodriguez was personally served with the Summons and Complaint
on December 20, 2023.
 
On January 30, 2024, the clerk entered default against Rodriguez.  
 
On June 14, 2024, Rodriguez filed this Motion to Set Aside
the Judgment and Any Default [CCP §§ 473(b), 473.5, 473(d), 128(a)(8),
86(b)3)].  Rodriguez is self-represented.

 
            Plaintiffs filed
an opposition.  
 
Rodriguez did not file a reply.  However, on October 4, 2024, Rodriguez filed
an amended motion which includes a copy of his proposed answer. 
 
            The motion
was heard on October 9, 2024.  In advance
of the hearing, the court issued a tentative ruling finding Rodriguez had
rebutted the presumption that service was proper.  However, because (1) Rodriguez cured the
procedural defects of his motion five days before the hearing and (2)
Plaintiffs’ opposition was not supported by a declaration from their process
server, the court continued the hearing for the motion.  Further, the court granted the parties leave
to submit additional briefing as to whether the presumption of proper service
has/has not been rebutted. 
 
            The parties
did not file supplemental briefing.  Accordingly, consistent with the court’s
October 9, 2024, order, the court finds Rodriguez has rebutted the presumption
that he was properly served with the summons and complaint.  Further, Rodriguez timely filed this motion
for relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), along
with a copy of his proposed answer.  The
default entered against Rodriguez on January 30, 2024, is VACATED.  Rodriguez’s proposed answer is deemed filed
as of this date.  The court further
directs Rodriguez to separately file his answer with the court within the next
five court days.  
 
Clerk of the court to give notice.
