And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the cross-complaint filed by Kennco Plumbing, Inc. against Uponor, Inc. and has sustained Uponor's demurrer with ten days leave to amend. Uponor argues that the claims in the cross-complaint are barred by two general release agreements executed in 2017 and 2019. Kennco argues that the agreements are subject to dispute regarding whether they extend to claims that Kennco was unaware of at the time of executing the release.

The court finds that the settlement agreements extend only to claims accrued in connection with incidents taking place on December 27, 2016 and March 27, 2018, involving the Property's plumbing system. Because the allegations in the cross-complaint do not show that the damages incurred took place on either of those dates, the court cannot determine that Kennco's claims fall within the scope of the settlement agreement.

The court also finds that the cross-complaint fails to state sufficient facts to constitute any cause of action, including claims for equitable indemnity, express indemnity, breach of express and implied warranties, breaches of contract, negligence, contribution, and declaratory relief. The court sustains the demurrer as to all causes of action.
