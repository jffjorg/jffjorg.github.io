And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Defendant's Motion to Transfer Venue in Case No. 21STCV47149. The motion was opposed by the Plaintiff, Babak Piltan, who is seeking damages from the Defendants, John J. Kaiser and Kaiser Legal Services, Inc., for breach of contract, legal malpractice, breach of fiduciary duty, IIED, unjust enrichment, and conversion. The Defendants argue that the venue should be transferred to San Diego County because they reside there, while the Plaintiff argues that the venue should remain in Los Angeles County because the alleged agreements were entered into in this county. The judge finds that the venue is proper in Los Angeles County because the Defendants' obligations under the contracts were to be performed in this county. The judge also rejects the Defendants' argument that the arbitration provision in the engagement letter establishes venue for purposes of this civil action. The motion is denied.
