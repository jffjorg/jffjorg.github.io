Hidden Ridge Lot 9, LLC vs. Kennco
Plumbing, Inc, et. al., Case No. 21STCV32125
 
Tentative Ruling re:  Cross-defendant’s Demurrer to Cross-complaint
 
            Cross-Defendant
Uponor, Inc. (Uponor) demurs to the Cross-Complaint of Kennco Plumbing, Inc.
(Kennco). The demurrer is sustained with ten (10) days leave to amend.
 
In reviewing the legal sufficiency
of a complaint against a demurrer, a court will treat the demurrer as admitting
all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions, or
conclusions of law. (Blank v. Kirwan
(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318 (Blank); C & H Foods Co. v. Hartford Ins. Co.
(1984) 163 Cal.App.3d 1055, 1062.) It is well settled that a “demurrer lies
only for defects appearing on the face of the complaint[.]” (Stevens v. Superior Court (1999) 75
Cal.App.4th 594, 601.) “The rules by which the sufficiency of a complaint is
tested against a general demurrer are well settled. We not only treat the
demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but also give the
complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in
their context.” (Guclimane Co. v. Stewart
Title Guaranty Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 38 (internal quotes omitted).) For
purposes of ruling on a demurrer, the complaint must be construed liberally by
drawing reasonable inferences from the facts pleaded. (Wilner v. Sunset Life Ins. Co. (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 952, 958.)
When ruling on a demurrer, the
Court may only consider the complaint’s allegations or matters which may be
judicially noticed. (Blank, supra, 39
Cal.3d at 318.) The Court may not consider any other extrinsic evidence or
judge the credibility of the allegations plead or the difficulty a plaintiff
may have in proving his allegations. (Ion
Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 881.) A demurrer is
properly sustained only when the complaint, liberally construed, fails to state
facts sufficient to constitute any cause of action. (Kramer v. Intuit Inc. (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 574, 578.)
 
Uponor argues that the claims in the Cross-Complaint are barred
based on two “General Release” agreements between the parties, executed on July
17, 2017 and February 13, 2019. (RJN, Ex. 1, Ex. 2.) Uponor argues that the Court should take notice of these
documents as “[f]acts
and propositions that are not reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of
immediate and accurate determination by resort to sources of reasonably
indisputable accuracy.” (Evid. Code § 452, subd. (h).)  Because Kennco does not deny that it entered
into the settlement agreements, judicial notice is proper. (Performance Plastering v. Richmond American
Homes of California, Inc.
(2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 659, 666 fn. 2.) 
 
Kennco argues that the agreements are subject to
dispute regarding whether they extend to claims that Kennco was unaware of at
the time of executing the release. (Civ. Code § 1542.) Kennco’s “actual dispute
is not with the contents of the documents . . . offered in support of [Cross-Defendant’s]
motion, but rather with the legal effect and proper interpretation of those
documents.” (Chacon v. Union Pacific Railroad (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 565,
573.) Given this, judicial notice is appropriate, and the documents may be
considered for purposes of this demurrer. “If the language of the agreement is
unambiguous and no disputed extrinsic evidence bears upon its meaning,
interpretation of the document is a legal issue for the court.” (Ibid.)
            The July 17, 2017
settlement agreement provides that Uponor will pay Kennco $8,941.70, in
exchange for:
[F]ull and final
settlement and satisfaction of all claims Releasors have or may have against
Releasee relative to plumbing system failures which occurred on Releasors’
property, including any claims for physical/emotion injury, property damage or
decreased value of their home . . . and as sole consideration for the full
release and discharge of all actions, claims and demands whatsoever, that may
now or hereafter exist or accrue against Uponor, Inc. as a direct or indirect
result of the damages, accident, casualty or event which occurred on or about
December 27, 2016 at [Property] relative to the plumbing system in that house.
(RJN, Ex. 1.)
 
            The language of
the February 13, 2019 General Release is identical, except that it releases
claims relating to the “damages, accident, casualty or event which occurred on
or about March 27, 2018 at [Property] relating to the plumbing system in that
home.” (RJN, Ex. 2.)
 
            The two
settlement agreements, by their plain terms, extend only to claims accrued in
connection with incidents taking place on December 27, 2016 and March 27, 2018,
involving the Property’s plumbing system. Because the allegations do not show
that the damages incurred took place on either of those dates, the Court cannot
determine that Kennco’s claims fall within the scope of the settlement
agreement. Kennco’s Cross-Complaint does not contain any specific factual
allegations regarding the events underlying its claims, though incorporates
Plaintiff Hidden Ridge’s Complaint. (CC ¶ 15.) In the incorporated Complaint, Hidden
Ridge alleges, “[w]ithin the last three (3) years from the date of this
Complaint, Plaintiff discovered that there were certain conditions at the
Project resulting in water penetration causing tangible property damage at the
Project.” (Comp. ¶ 15.) There are no other allegations identifying the date of the
water damage incidents underlying Plaintiff’s claims. Consequently, on the face
of the documents, Kennco’s claims are not barred by the parties’ agreements. 
 
            The Court agrees
with Uponor that the Cross-Complaint fails to state sufficient facts to
constitute any cause of action. The Cross-Complaint alleges nine causes of
action against Uponor, for equitable indemnity, express indemnity, breach of
express and implied warranties, breaches of contract, negligence, contribution,
and declaratory relief. Kennco has not pled the existence of any specific
contract, warranty, or indemnification agreement. (See McKell v. Washington Mutual, Inc. (2006) 142
Cal.App.4th 1457, 1489 [“A written contract may be pleaded either by its terms
. . . or by its legal effect”]; Four Star
Electric, Inc. v. F & H Construction
(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1375, 1380 [“An indemnitee seeking to recover on an
agreement for indemnification must allege
the parties' contractual relationship…”].) Neither of Kennco’s claims for declaratory relief identify the
written instrument or contract at issue. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1060; CC ¶¶ 58-69.)
Kennco’s claim for negligence is also pled in purely conclusory terms. (CC ¶¶
51-55.) Accordingly, the demurrer is sustained as to all causes of action.
