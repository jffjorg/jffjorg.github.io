     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant halo behavioral health, inc.’s
  demurrer and motion to strike 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On May 23, 2023, Plaintiff Michael
Boyd filed this action against Defendants Megan St. Clair, Peter Burra, HALO
Behavioral Health, Inc., Brandon St. Clair, and Paul Meyers. Plaintiff filed
the operative Second Amended Complaint on June 11, 2024, asserting 15 causes of
action arising from the following facts. 
            Plaintiff alleges that he was
engaged to Kathleen St. Clair (Kathleen) until her death in May 2022.
Kathleen’s two children, Defendants Megan St. Clair (Megan) and Brandon St.
Clair (Brandon), were allegedly hostile towards Kathleen and resentful of the relationship
between Plaintiff and Kathleen. When Kathleen was hospitalized for a heart
attack, Megan allegedly used a California Advanced Health Care Directive
(CAHCD) to place Kathleen in hospice, exclude Plaintiff from visiting, and
prohibit Kathleen’s healthcare providers from communicating with Plaintiff. 
The complaint alleges that Megan and her
husband, Defendant Bryan Burra (Burra), falsely accused Plaintiff of having a
criminal record as a pretext to exclude him from Kathleen’s care. Megan and
Burra allegedly embarked on a scheme to investigate Plaintiff and fabricate and
disseminate false information on Plaintiff. This scheme allegedly involved
resources and employees of their business, Defendant HALO Behavioral Health,
Inc. (HALO). Megan allegedly filed for a temporary restraining order (TRO)
against Plaintiff based on false information. 
In November 2022, Plaintiff was
hospitalized. Defendant Paul Meyers (Meyers), Kathleen’s brother, allegedly
discovered this by calling the hospital and then informed Brandon. Brandon then
allegedly took the opportunity to break into Plaintiff’s home, taking furniture
and other property. Plaintiff alleges that Megan, Burra, and Meyers were either
present at or assisted in the burglary and that Megan and Burra took possession
of the stolen property. Plaintiff alleges that Megan and Burra burglarized his
home again in January 2023. 
On July 24, 2024, HALO filed the instant
demurrer and motion to strike against the SAC. Plaintiff filed his late
opposition on August 8, 2024. HALO filed its reply on August 12, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether
the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. (Taylor v. City of Los
Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)
In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the
pleading or by proper judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd.
(a).) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters. (SKF Farms v. Superior
Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) Therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (Ibid.) The only issue involved in a
demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with
extraneous matters, states a cause of action. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at 747.)
 
MEET AND CONFER
Before filing a demurrer or a motion to
strike, the demurring or moving party is required to meet and confer with the
party who filed the pleading demurred to or the pleading that is subject to the
motion to strike for the purposes of determining whether an agreement can be
reached through a filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, 435.5.)
The Court notes that Defendant has complied with the meet and confer
requirement. (See Martinez Decl.)
DISCUSSION
I.
Vicarious Liability
            a. Legal Principles
“Under the doctrine of respondeat
superior, an employer is vicariously liable for his employee's torts committed
within the scope of the employment.” (Perez v. Van Groningen & Sons
(1986) 41 Cal.3d 962, 967.) Wrongdoing is considered within the scope of
employment if “in the context of the particular enterprise an employee's
conduct is not so unusual or startling that it would seem unfair to include the
loss resulting from it among other costs of the employer's business.” (Rodgers
v. Kemper Constr. Co. (1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 608, 619.) 
            “In California, the scope of
employment has been interpreted broadly under the respondeat superior doctrine.”
(Farmers Ins. Group v. County of Santa Clara (1995) 11 Cal.4th 992, 1004.)
Thus, “[t]he fact that an employee is not engaged in the ultimate object of his
employment at the time of his wrongful act does not preclude attribution of
liability to an employer.” (Alma W. v. Oakland Unified School Dist.
(1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 133, 139.) “For example, acts necessary to the comfort,
convenience, health, and welfare of the employee while at work, though strictly
personal to himself and not acts of service, do not take him outside the scope
of his employment.” (Ibid.) 
“However, that is not to say, that
employers are strictly liable for all actions of their employees during working
hours. If an employee substantially deviates from his duties for personal
purposes, the employer is not vicariously liable for the employee's actions.” (Alma
W., supra, 123 Cal.App.3d at p. 139.) “Thus, if the employee ‘inflicts an
injury out of personal malice, not engendered by the employment’ [citation] or
acts out of ‘personal malice unconnected with the employment’ [citation], or if
the misconduct is not an ‘outgrowth’ of the employment [citation], the employee
is not acting within the scope of employment.” (Farmers, supra, 11
Cal.4th at p. 1005.) In such a case, “the mere fact that an employee has an
opportunity to abuse facilities or authority necessary to the performance of
his or her duties does not render the employer vicariously liable.” (Id.
at p. 1006.) “If an employee's tort is personal in nature, mere presence at the
place of employment and attendance to occupational duties prior or subsequent
to the offense will not give rise to a cause of action against the employer
under the doctrine of respondeat superior.” (Alma W., supra, 123
Cal.App.3d at p. 140.)   
b. Application
“Ordinarily, the determination whether an
employee has acted within the scope of employment presents a question of fact.”
(Farmers, supra, 11 Cal.4th at p. 1019.) Here, Plaintiff has alleged
sufficient facts to support an inference that Megan’s and Burra’s actions were
connected to their employment at HALO. Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants’
actions were in retaliation for Plaintiff’s filing of a complaint to the
Behavior Analyst Certification Board (BACB). (SAC ¶¶ 90-93.) The SAC alleges
that HALO operates under Megan’s BACB certification as a Behavior Analyst. (Id.,
¶ 87.) In Spring 2022, Plaintiff allegedly reported HALO, Megan, and Burra for
failure to comply with BACB certification and licensing requirements. (Id.,
¶ 91.) The conduct detailed in the SAC was allegedly carried out to discredit
and retaliate against Plaintiff for his complaint to the BACB. (Id., ¶
93.) 
HALO argues that the addition of
allegations regarding Plaintiff’s BACB complaint does not suddenly render HALO
liable for every cause of action in the SAC. HALO argues that Plaintiff fails
to articulate which specific acts were actually connected to the BACB issue.
HALO maintains that the allegations only demonstrate acts arising from personal
malice. However, “where the employee is combining his own business with that of
his employer, or attending to both at substantially the same time, no nice
inquiry will be made as to which business he was actually engaged in at the
time of injury, unless it clearly appears that neither directly nor indirectly
could he have been serving his employer.” (Farmers, supra, 11 Cal.4th at
p. 1004.) 
While the allegations in the SAC do
suggest personal malice based on the individual defendants’ resentment of
Plaintiff’s relationship with Kathleen, that does not preclude Megan and Burra
from also acting in the interests of HALO and their employment therein. For
demurrer purposes, it must be assumed true that Megan and Burra engaged in a
course of action to discredit and retaliate against Plaintiff for his BACB
complaint. (SAC ¶¶ 90-93.) It may be reasonably inferred that Megan and Burra
engaged in this course of action because the BACB complaint threatened HALO’s
ability to operate. Thus, the alleged acts may be “fairly attributable to
work-related events or conditions.” (See Lisa M. v. Henry Mayo Newhall
Memorial Hospital (1995) 12 Cal.4th 291, 301.) At the pleading stage, the
parties need not engage in a granular dissection of which precise acts were
actually in service of HALO. The SAC sufficiently establishes that the overall
course of conduct was done for this purpose. 

II.
Factual Sufficiency of Each Claim 
            HALO also demurs to each individual
cause of action for failure to state sufficient facts, purportedly on grounds
beyond the vicarious liability issue. However, HALO’s arguments largely fall
back on its contention that the alleged acts can only be attributed to the
individual defendants rather than HALO. HALO additionally reiterates arguments
that the Court already rejected in a prior demurrer. 
            a. Defamation
            HALO argues that statements made as
part of the TRO proceedings are privileged under Civil Code section 47.
However, as the Court held previously, the litigation privilege does not cover the
other alleged acts of defamation. For example, the alleged crafting and
publishing of a false criminal record may be reasonably considered as part of
the scheme to discredit and retaliate against Plaintiff after his BACB
complaint. (See SAC ¶¶ 42-47.) 
            HALO also argues that merely
conducting “internet searches” does not constitute defamation. Plaintiff does
not base the defamation claim on internet searches. HALO acknowledges that the
SAC alleges publications made by Megan and Burra. Thus, the SAC alleges
publications, not mere research. Again, whether these publications were
sufficiently linked to the employment with HALO is a question of fact.
            b. Malicious Prosecution
            HALO argues that the excerpted
segments of Megan’s declaration show probable cause for filing the TRO, i.e.,
she was concerned for her safety and believed Plaintiff had a criminal record.
On a demurrer, the Court cannot take judicial notice of facts asserted in a
court filing, even if the filing itself is judicially noticeable. (Herrera v.
Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1366, 1375.) Thus,
the Court cannot assume the truth of Megan’s motivations for filing the TRO. Instead, the
Court assumes Plaintiff’s allegations as true, i.e., Megan did not have
probable cause for filing the TRO. Moreover, Megan’s genuine concern for her
safety relates to her subjective intent, whereas probable cause is objective.
(See Area 55, supra, 61 Cal.App.5th at p. 165.) And as discussed above,
whether the false filing of a TRO is sufficiently connected to HALO is a
question for the trier of fact. 
            
 
c. Theft, Conversion, and Trespass
            HALO reiterates the rejected
argument that most of the property allegedly stolen belonged to Kathleen and
that the home being burglarized belonged to Kathleen. As the Court held
previously, Plaintiff alleges that his personal property was stolen, particularly
computer drives. (See SAC ¶ 83.) The Court has also already found that
Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged ownership or control of the property that
was burglarized. (See May 22, 2024 Order re Dem. 4:23-5:4.) 
Plaintiff alleges that the stolen drives
contained information relating to his BACB complaint. (SAC ¶ 83.) Therefore,
the alleged theft, conversion, and trespass may reasonably be considered as
part of the scheme to discredit and retaliate against Plaintiff for his BACB
complaint. This establishes a sufficient connection to HALO for purposes of
vicarious liability. 
d. Invasion of Privacy
As HALO acknowledges, the invasion of
privacy claims are premised on the alleged defamation and theft/trespass. As
discussed above, the defamation, theft, and trespass claims are adequately
pled. The Court has already held that the allegations are sufficiently clear
for pleading purposes and demonstrate an invasion of privacy. (May 22, 2024
Order re Dem. 5:15-23.) And as discussed above, stealing computer drivers
containing information on Plaintiff’s BACB complaint sufficiently establishes a
connection to HALO. 
e. Stalking
As the Court held previously, the
allegations sufficiently establish stalking. (May 22, 2024 Order re Dem.
6:19-24.) It is a factual matter whether the alleged surveillance of Plaintiff
sufficiently furthered the scheme to discredit and retaliate against Plaintiff
for his BACB complaint or otherwise served HALO’s interests. 
 
 
f. Intentional and Negligent Infliction of
Emotional Distress
To state a cause
of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, a plaintiff must
establish: (1) outrageous conduct by the defendant; (2) the defendant’s
intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of causing,
emotional distress; (3) the plaintiff’s suffering severe or extreme emotional
distress; and (4) actual and proximate causation of the emotional distress by
the defendant’s outrageous conduct. (Vasquez v. Franklin Management Real
Estate Fund, Inc. (2013) 222 Cal.App.4th 819, 832.) “For conduct to be
outrageous, it must be so extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually
tolerated by a civilized community.” (Faunce v. Cate (2013) 222
Cal.App.4th 166, 172.) “Severe
emotional distress [is] emotional distress of such substantial quantity or
enduring quality that no reasonable man in a civilized society should be
expected to endure it.” (Fletcher v. Western Life Insurance Co. (1970)
10 Cal.App.3d 376, 397.) 
Plaintiff fails
to allege severe emotional distress. “[D]iscomfort, worry, anxiety, upset
stomach, concern, and agitation” do not satisfy the severity standard. (Hughes
v. Pair (2009) 46 Cal.4th 1035, 1051.) Plaintiff makes generic allegations
such as “suffering, anguish, fright, horror, nervousness, grief, anxiety,
worry, shock, humiliation, and shame.” (See SAC ¶ 299.) This does not
sufficiently demonstrate severe emotional distress. 
Additionally, “[t]here is no independent
tort of negligent infliction of emotional distress; rather, ‘[t]he tort is
negligence, a cause of action in which a duty to the plaintiff is an essential
element.’” (Ragland v. U.S. Bank National Assn. (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th
182, 205, quoting Potter v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. (1993) 6
Cal.4th 965, 984.) Plaintiff has failed to allege any duty of care owed by HALO
towards him. Therefore, the NIED claim fails for this additional reason. 
 
 
g. Negligent Hiring and Civil Conspiracy 
“The plaintiff may not amend the complaint
to add a new cause of action without having obtained permission to do so,
unless the new cause of action is within the scope of the order granting leave
to amend.” (Harris v. Wachovia Mortgage, FSB (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th
1018, 1023.) Plaintiff was not given leave to assert a new cause of action.
Therefore, the negligent hiring and conspiracy claims are stricken. 
III.
Punitive Damages
            As the Court held previously, the
alleged conduct is sufficiently despicable, cruel, or unjust for pleading
purposes. (May 22, 2024 Order re Dem. 8:20-24.) Defendants allegedly sought to
discredit and retaliate against Plaintiff because he complained to the BACB.
This sufficiently shows malice. 
CONCLUSION
            HALO’s demurrer is SUSTAINED without
leave to amend as to the tenth, eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, and fifteenth
causes of action and OVERRULED in all other respects. HALO’s motion to strike
is DENIED.

  order RE:
defendant paul meyers’ demurrer to second
  amended complaint 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On May 23, 2023, Plaintiff Michael
Boyd filed this action against Defendants Megan St. Clair, Peter Burra, HALO
Behavioral Health, Inc., Brandon St. Clair, and Paul Meyers. Plaintiff filed
the operative Second Amended Complaint on June 11, 2024, asserting 15 causes of
action arising from the following facts. 
            Plaintiff alleges that he was
engaged to Kathleen St. Clair (Kathleen) until her death in May 2022.
Kathleen’s two children, Defendants Megan St. Clair (Megan) and Brandon St.
Clair (Brandon), were allegedly hostile towards Kathleen and resentful of the relationship
between Plaintiff and Kathleen. When Kathleen was hospitalized for a heart
attack, Megan allegedly used a California Advanced Health Care Directive
(CAHCD) to place Kathleen in hospice, exclude Plaintiff from visiting, and
prohibit Kathleen’s healthcare providers from communicating with Plaintiff. 
The complaint alleges that Megan and her
husband, Defendant Bryan Burra (Burra), falsely accused Plaintiff of having a
criminal record as a pretext to exclude him from Kathleen’s care. Megan and
Burra allegedly embarked on a scheme to investigate Plaintiff and fabricate and
disseminate false information on Plaintiff. This scheme allegedly involved
resources and employees of their business, Defendant HALO Behavioral Health,
Inc. (HALO). Megan allegedly filed for a temporary restraining order (TRO)
against Plaintiff based on false information. 
In November 2022, Plaintiff was
hospitalized. Defendant Paul Meyers (Meyers), Kathleen’s brother, allegedly
discovered this by calling the hospital and then informed Brandon. Brandon then
allegedly took the opportunity to break into Plaintiff’s home, taking furniture
and other property. Plaintiff alleges that Megan, Burra, and Meyers were either
present at or assisted in the burglary and that Megan and Burra took possession
of the stolen property. Plaintiff alleges that Megan and Burra burglarized his
home again in January 2023. 
On July 16, 2024, Meyers filed the instant
demurrer to the first, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, tenth, and
eleventh causes of action in the SAC. Plaintiff filed his late opposition on
August 6, 2024. Meyers filed his reply on August 9, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether
the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. (Taylor v. City of Los
Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)
In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the
pleading or by proper judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd.
(a).) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters. (SKF Farms v. Superior
Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) Therefore, it lies only where the

demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with
extraneous matters, states a cause of action. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at 747.)
MEET AND CONFER
Before filing a demurrer or a motion to
strike, the demurring or moving party is required to meet and confer with the
party who filed the pleading demurred to or the pleading that is subject to the
motion to strike for the purposes of determining whether an agreement can be
reached through a filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, 435.5.)
The Court notes that Defendant has complied with the meet and confer
requirement. (See Manaa Decl.)
DISCUSSION
I.
Defamation and False Light (First and Eighth COAs)
            The elements of a defamation claim
are: (1) publication that is (2) false, (3) defamatory, (4) unprivileged, and
(5) has a natural tendency to injure or cause special damage. (Wong v. Jing
(2010) 189 Cal.App.4th 1354, 1369.) False statements charging the commission of
crime, or tending directly to injure a plaintiff in respect to his or her
profession by imputing dishonesty or questionable professional conduct are
defamatory
per se. (Burrill v. Nair (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 357, 383.) “[Where] the
language is ambiguous and an explanation is necessary to establish the
defamatory meaning, the pleader must do two things: (1) Allege his
interpretation of the defamatory meaning of the language (the ‘innuendo,’ . .
.); (2) support that interpretation by alleging facts showing that the readers
or hearers to whom it was published would understand it in that defamatory
sense (the ‘inducement’).” (Barnes-Hind, Inc. v. Superior Court (1986)
181 Cal.App.3d 377, 387.) 
            Here, the defamation claim as
against Meyers is based on the allegation that Meyers falsely claimed that
Plaintiff was living in Kathleen’s house “for free.” (SAC ¶¶ 50-51.) A
statement that someone is living in a home for free is not defamatory per se. Plaintiff
has failed to allege the defamatory meaning of the statement, as well as the
defamatory effect on a listener. (See Barnes-Hind, supra, 181 Cal.App.3d
at p. 387.) Therefore, the defamation claim fails as a matter of law.
            “When a false light claim is coupled
with a defamation claim, the false light claim is essentially superfluous, and
stands or falls on whether it meets the same requirements as the defamation
cause of action.” (Jackson v. Mayweather (2017) 10 Cal.App.5th 1240,
1264.) Because the defamation claim fails, so does the derivative false light
claim.
The demurrer is SUSTAINED as to the first
and eighth causes of action.  
II.
Trespass, Theft, Conversion, and Invasion of Privacy (Third, Fourth, Fifth,
Sixth, and Seventh COAs) 
            Meyers argues that there are no
allegations he directly participated in the alleged breaking into Plaintiff’s
property or stealing Plaintiff’s personal belongings. However, Meyers does not
challenge the civil conspiracy claim. “The elements of an action for civil
conspiracy are (1) formation and operation of the conspiracy and (2) damage
resulting to plaintiff (3) from a wrongful act done in furtherance of the
common design.” (Prakashpalan v. Engstrom, Lipscomb & Lack (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 1105, 1136.) “The significance of a conspiracy theory of
liability is that each member may be held jointly liable as a tortfeasor, even
though he or she may not have participated directly in the underlying tort.” (Ibid.)

            The SAC alleges that Meyers assisted
in the breaking and theft by informing Brandon that Plaintiff had been
hospitalized and was away from home. (SAC ¶ 193.) The SAC further alleges that
Meyers was “present and participated” in the trespass onto Plaintiff’s
property. (Id., ¶ 222.) These facts sufficiently support liability
against Meyers under civil conspiracy. Therefore, Plaintiff has adequately pled
claims for trespass, theft, conversion, and invasion of privacy against
Meyers.  
            The demurrer is OVERRULED as to the
third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh causes of action. 
III.
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (Tenth COA)
To state a cause
of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, a plaintiff must
establish: (1) outrageous conduct by the defendant; (2) the defendant’s
intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of causing,
emotional distress; (3) the plaintiff’s suffering severe or extreme emotional
distress; and (4) actual and proximate causation of the emotional distress by
the defendant’s outrageous conduct. (Vasquez v. Franklin Management Real
Estate Fund, Inc. (2013) 222 Cal.App.4th 819, 832.) “For conduct to be
outrageous, it must be so extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually
tolerated by a civilized community.” (Faunce v. Cate (2013) 222
Cal.App.4th 166, 172.) “Severe
emotional distress [is] emotional distress of such substantial quantity or
enduring quality that no reasonable man in a civilized society should be
expected to endure it.” (Fletcher v. Western Life Insurance Co. (1970)
10 Cal.App.3d 376, 397.) 
Plaintiff fails
to allege severe emotional distress. “[D]iscomfort, worry, anxiety, upset
stomach, concern, and agitation” do not satisfy the severity standard. (Hughes
v. Pair (2009) 46 Cal.4th 1035, 1051.) Plaintiff makes generic allegations
such as “suffering, anguish, fright, horror, nervousness, grief, anxiety,
worry, shock, humiliation, and shame.” (See SAC ¶ 299.) This does not
sufficiently demonstrate severe emotional distress. 
The demurrer is SUSTAINED as to the tenth
cause of action. 
IV.
Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress (Eleventh COA)
            “There is no independent tort of
negligent infliction of emotional distress; rather, ‘[t]he tort is negligence,
a cause of action in which a duty to the plaintiff is an essential element.’” (Ragland
v. U.S. Bank National Assn. (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 182, 205, quoting Potter
v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 965, 984.) 
            Plaintiff has failed to allege any
duty of care owed by Meyers towards him. Therefore, the NIED claim fails for
this additional reason. 
            The demurrer is SUSTAINED as to the
eleventh cause of action.   
CONCLUSION
            Defendant Paul Meyers’ demurrer is
SUSTAINED in part as set forth above without leave to amend.
