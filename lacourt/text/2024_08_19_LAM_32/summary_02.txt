Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled in favor of the plaintiff, Victor Velasquez Tapia, and granted his motion to compel responses to discovery requests. The plaintiff filed the motion after the defendant, Slauson Super Mall Inc., failed to respond to the discovery requests despite being granted multiple extensions. The judge found that the defendant's failure to respond was unreasonable and that an order compelling responses was warranted. The judge did not award any sanctions to the plaintiff, as he did not request them in his notice of motion. The defendant is ordered to provide responses to the discovery requests within 10 days of the order, and objections are waived except for those related to privacy and privilege.
