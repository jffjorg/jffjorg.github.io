And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to compel arbitration in this employment discrimination action. The defendants argued that the plaintiff signed an "Agreement to Arbitrate" on June 15, 2020, which covers wrongful termination, discrimination, retaliation, and harassment. However, the judge found that the plaintiff does not dispute the existence of the agreement or its terms, and therefore, the defendants have satisfied their initial burden of proving the existence of an arbitration agreement.

The judge also considered the applicability of the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act (EFAA). The EFAA provides that no predispute arbitration agreement or predispute joint-action waiver shall be valid or enforceable with respect to a case that relates to sexual assault or sexual harassment. The judge found that the claims in this case relate to sexual harassment, and therefore, the EFAA applies.

The judge rejected the defendants' argument that the EFAA only applies to claims that accrued before March 3, 2022. Instead, the judge found that the allegations in the First Amended Complaint sufficiently establish that the sexual harassment continued through March 3, 2022, and therefore, the EFAA bars arbitration of all claims, including those related to discrimination, retaliation, and failure to accommodate.
