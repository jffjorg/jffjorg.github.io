The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendant Paul Meyers to the Second Amended Complaint (SAC). The Court has sustained the demurrer as to the first and eighth causes of action (defamation and false light) and sustained the demurrer as to the tenth and eleventh causes of action (intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress, respectively). The Court has overruled the demurrer as to the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh causes of action (trespass, theft, conversion, and invasion of privacy) against Meyers, finding that the SAC adequately pled these claims against him. The Court has also sustained the demurrer as to the fifteenth cause of action (negligent hiring and civil conspiracy) because it was not properly pled.
