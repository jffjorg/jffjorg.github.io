  Case No.:  24STCV12145
  Hearing Date:  August 19, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendants’ motion to compel arbitration
  




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On May 14, 2024, Plaintiff Daisy
Solano filed this employment discrimination action against Defendants Hawaiian
Gardens Casino and Nicholas Bolger. Plaintiff filed the First Amended Complaint
on May 31, 2024. 
            On July 25, 2024, Defendants filed
the instant motion to compel arbitration. Plaintiff filed her opposition on
August 6, 2024. Defendants filed their reply on August 14, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
“On petition of a party to an arbitration
agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a
controversy and that a party to the agreement refuses to arbitrate that
controversy, the court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to
arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the
controversy exists….” (Code Civ. Proc, § 1281.2.) “The party seeking
arbitration bears the burden of proving the existence of an arbitration
agreement, and the party opposing arbitration bears the burden of proving any
defense, such as unconscionability.” (Pinnacle Museum Tower Assn. v.
Pinnacle Market Development (US), LLC (2012) 55 Cal.4th 223, 236.)
DISCUSSION
I.
Proof of Agreement
            “The moving party ‘can meet its
initial burden by attaching to the motion or petition a copy of the arbitration
agreement purporting to bear the opposing party's signature.’” (Gamboa v.
Northeast Community Clinic (2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 158, 165.) 
            Here, Plaintiff signed an “Agreement
to Arbitrate” on June 15, 2020, covering “any and all disputes, claims or
controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the employment
relationship between the parties, or the termination of the employment
relationship.” (Fausto Decl., Ex. A.) The agreement specifically identifies
wrongful termination, discrimination, retaliation, and harassment as the types
of claims within its coverage. (Ibid.) The agreement covers “any claims
the Company may have against Employee, or that Employee may have against the
Company or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, parents,
subsidiaries, or affiliated entities.” (Ibid.) 
            Plaintiff does not dispute the
existence of the agreement, its terms, or her signature on it. Thus, Defendants
have satisfied their initial burden of proving the existence of an arbitration
agreement covering the claims at issue. 
II.
Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act (EFAA)
            a. Statutory Framework
The EFAA provides that “no predispute
arbitration agreement or predispute joint-action waiver shall be valid or
enforceable with respect to a case which is filed under Federal, Tribal, or
State law and relates to the sexual assault dispute or the sexual harassment
dispute.” (9 U.S.C. § 402.) “The term ‘predispute arbitration agreement’ means
any agreement to arbitrate a dispute that had not yet arisen at the time of the
making of the agreement.” (Id., § 401(1).) “The term ‘sexual harassment
dispute’ means a dispute relating to conduct that is alleged to constitute
sexual harassment under applicable Federal, Tribal, or State law.” (Id.,
§ 401(4).) 
            b. Application to “Disputes”
Arising After March 3, 2022
The EFAA applies “to any dispute or claim
that arises or accrues on or after March 3, 2022.” (9 U.S.C. § 401.) “[T]he
date that a dispute has arisen for purposes of the Act depends on the unique
facts of each case, but a dispute does not arise merely from the fact of injury”
or “solely from the alleged sexual conduct.” (Kader v. Southern California
Medical Center, Inc. (2024) 99 Cal.App.5th 214, 218, 222.) Instead, “[a]
dispute arises when one party asserts a right, claim, or demand, and the other
side expresses disagreement or takes an adversarial posture.” (Id. at p.
222.) This is unlike a claim, which “arises for the first time when the
plaintiff suffers an injury.” (Id. at p. 223.) Thus, “a claim may arise
or accrue before a dispute arises.” (Id. at pp. 224-25.) 
In Kader, despite the alleged
sexually harassing conduct beginning in 2018, there was no evidence that the
plaintiff ever reported the harassment to his employer or that the employer
disputed any claim before March 3, 2022. (Kader, supra, 99 Cal.App.5th
at pp. 218-19, 224.) A dispute did not arise until the plaintiff filed charges
with the Department of Fair Employment and Housing[1] in
May 2022. (Id. at p. 224.) Because the dispute arose after March 3,
2022, “the Act applied to invalidate the predispute arbitration agreement.” (Id.
at p. 225.)    
Here, Defendants argue that the EFAA does
not apply because “Plaintiff’s claims . . . arose and accrued during her
employment, beginning in 2018.” (Mtn. 10:14-16.) Defendants further argue that
“Plaintiff does not allege any acts of sexual harassment that occurred
on or after March 3, 2022.” (Reply 9:9-10.) However, as discussed above, the
date that wrongdoing is committed or a claim accrues is not dispositive,
because the EFAA operates in relation to “the sexual harassment dispute.”
(See 9 U.S.C. §§ 401, 402; Kader, supra, 99 Cal.App.5th at pp. 222-25.)
In this case, as in Kader, there is no indication that a dispute arose
until Plaintiff filed charges with the CRD in May 2024. (See Odell Decl., Ex.
C.) Even assuming a dispute arose when Plaintiff reported the harassment to
Defendants, that allegedly occurred in September 2023. (FAC ¶ 21.) Either way,
the dispute arose after March 3, 2022. Defendants identify no other date when a
dispute could have arisen. 
Defendants’ reliance on the unpublished
opinion in Martinez v. Simplified Labor Staffing Solutions (May 15,
2024, No. B331667) 2024 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 3021 is unavailing. It is true
that the court in Martinez held the EFAA applied because the plaintiff “alleged
acts that arose after EFASASH was signed into law.” (Id., at *6.)
However, the court did not hold that the EFAA only applies if the
alleged acts occur after the EFAA’s enactment. Martinez did not concern
a situation where the alleged conduct occurred before March 3, 2022, but a
dispute arose afterwards. “A court's opinion is not authority for a proposition
not considered in it.” (People v. Anderson (2015) 232 Cal.App.4th 1259,
1275.) Kader is therefore more on point and also binding, unlike Martinez.
Because the sexual harassment dispute in this case arose after March 3, 2022,
the EFAA applies.    
c. Continuing Violation
Even if the EFAA only applied to claims
that accrued before March 3, 2022, Plaintiff alleges sexual harassment
“throughout her employment,” which lasted until March 2024. (FAC ¶¶ 20, 27.)
Under the continuing violation doctrine, a claim based on a “pattern of
reasonably frequent and similar acts” accrues on the date of the last act. (Willis
v. City of Carlsbad (2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 1104, 1124.) “[H]ostile work
environment claims . . . by their very nature involve repeated conduct and thus
cannot be said to occur on any particular day.” (Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA,
Inc. (2005) 36 Cal.4th 1028, 1057.) “[A] harassment claim is composed of a
series of separate acts that collectively constitute one ‘unlawful employment
practice.’” (Ibid.) Thus, “it is appropriate to apply the continuing
violation doctrine to . . . harassment claims.” (Id. at p. 1058.)
Here, the allegations in the FAC
sufficiently establish that the sexual harassment, even if it began before
March 3, 2022, continued through that date. Thus, the sexual harassment claim
accrued after March 3, 2022. As a result, applying Defendants’ legal standard
(in contravention of Kader) leads to the same conclusion.  
d. Application to Claims Other Than Sexual
Harassment 
Defendants request the alternative remedy
of ordering arbitration for all claims except the sexual harassment claim, arguing
that the EFAA only bars arbitration of the harassment claim. The EFAA provides
that “no predispute arbitration agreement or predispute joint-action waiver
shall be valid or enforceable with respect to a case which is filed under
Federal, Tribal, or State law and relates to the sexual assault dispute
or the sexual harassment dispute.” (9 U.S.C. § 402.) 
Defendants argue that the remaining claims
do not stem from conduct fitting the EFAA’s definition of “sexual harassment.”
(See 9 U.S.C. § 401.) However, those claims, even if not for sexual harassment,
sufficiently “relate to” the sexual harassment dispute. Plaintiff alleges
discrimination based on the same mistreatment. Plaintiff alleges retaliation
for her reporting of the alleged mistreatment. Plaintiff alleges disability
discrimination and failure to accommodate based on the anxiety and stress that
she suffered as a result of the mistreatment. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants
failed to prevent or address the mistreatment. Plaintiff has not alleged
distinct claims such as wage and hour, for example. (See Doe v. Indus Invs.,
2023 Cal. Super. LEXIS 48876, *12-13 [distinguishing claims based on “other
forms of discrimination and retaliation” from “unrelated . . . wage and hour
claims” in applying the EFAA]; see also Johnson v. Everyrealm, Inc. (S.D.N.Y.
2023) 657 F.Supp.3d 535, 559 [EFAA “extends to the entirety of the case
relating to the sexual harassment dispute, not merely the discrete claims in
that case that themselves either allege such harassment or relate to a sexual
harassment dispute”].) Therefore, the claims sufficiently “relate to” the
sexual harassment dispute to fall under the EFAA. Accordingly, all of the
claims are barred from arbitration.  
CONCLUSION
            Defendants’ motion to compel
arbitration is DENIED.
