                        Plaintiff,
            v.
 
SLAUSON SUPER MALL INC.,
  
                        Defendant.
  


 
  Case No.:  23STCV22028
  Hearing Date:  August 19, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motions to compel responses
  to discovery 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On September 13, 2023, Plaintiff
Victor Velasquez Tapia filed this employment discrimination action against
Defendant Slauson Super Mall Inc. 
            On July 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant two motions to compel responses to its form interrogatories and
requests for production. Defendant has not filed an opposition. 
LEGAL STANDARD
Discovery responses are due 30 days after
service of the requests, unless the parties stipulate or the court orders
otherwise. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260(a), 2031.260(a), 2033.250(a).) If a
responding party fails to respond in time, the propounding party may move for
an order compelling the responses or deeming matters admitted. (Id., §§
2030.290(b), 2031.300(b), 2033.280(b).) The responding party also waives its
objections. (Id., §§ 2030.290(a), 2031.300(a), 2033.280(a).)  
 
 
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff propounded the subject
discovery on February 1, 2024, with a due date of March 4, 2024. (Rinka Decl. ¶
3.) Plaintiff granted Defendant’s request for an extension to April 3, 2024. (Id.,
¶ 4.) Plaintiff granted a second extension to April 18, 2024. (Id., ¶
5.) On May 27, 2024, Defendant requested a one-week extension, which Plaintiff
granted. (Id., ¶ 7.) To date, Defendant has not produced any responses.
(Id., ¶ 8.) 
            Defendant does not oppose the motion
nor dispute any of the above facts. Thus, an order compelling responses is
warranted. Although Plaintiff’s counsel submitted a declaration regarding the
time and hourly rate spent on the motion, Plaintiff did not request sanctions
in his notice of motion nor make any argument about sanctions in his points and
authorities. Therefore, the Court does not award any sanctions. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motions to compel
responses are GRANTED. Defendant shall provide responses to the subject
discovery within 10 days of this order. Objections are waived except as to
privacy and privilege.
