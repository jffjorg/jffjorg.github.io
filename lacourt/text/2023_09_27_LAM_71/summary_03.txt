And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the demurrer filed by Defendant Gregory Peck to Plaintiff Sitrick Group, LLC's complaint, as the Plaintiff filed its first amended complaint on September 13, 2023, making the demurrer moot. The demurrer was filed on July 7, 2023, and should have been taken off calendar. The judge relied on California Code of Civil Procedure section 472(a) and the case of People ex rel. Strathmann v. Acacia Research Corp. (2012) to come to this conclusion. The hearing on the demurrer is therefore denied.
