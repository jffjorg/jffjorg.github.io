SITRICK
  GROUP, LLC, 
  
         vs.
 
GREGORY PECK.


 Case No.: 
  23STCV06207
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  September 27, 2023



 
Defendant Gregory Peck’s demurrer to
Plaintiff Sitrick Group, LLC’s complaint is denied
as moot based on Plaintiff’s September 13, 2023, filing of its first amended
complaint.
 
          Defendant Gregory
Peck (“Peck”) (“Defendant”) demurs to the complaint (“Complaint”) of Plaintiff Sitrick
Group, LLC (“Sitrick”) (“Plaintiff”). 
(Notice of Demurrer, pg. 1.)  
          Defendant
filed the instant motion on July 7, 2023. 
Plaintiff filed its first amended complaint (“FAC”) on September 13,
2023.
          Pursuant to
C.C.P. §472(a), “[a] party may amend its pleading once without leave of
the court at any time before the answer, demurrer, or motion to strike is
filed, or after a demurrer or motion to strike is filed but before the demurrer
or motion to strike is heard if the amended pleading is filed and served no
later than the date for filing an opposition to the demurrer or motion to
strike.”  Plaintiff’s FAC was filed nine
court days before the hearing on the instant demurrer and is therefore timely
filed.  This demurrer should have been
taken off calendar.  (See People ex
rel. Strathmann v. Acacia Research Corp. (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 487, 506.)
 
          Conclusion
Defendant’s
demurrer to Plaintiff’s complaint is
denied as moot.

Moving Party to
give notice.
