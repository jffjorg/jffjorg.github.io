And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent the defendant from managing the intellectual property at issue. The defendant has breached the contract and the plaintiff has accelerated payments and made full payment on the contract. The court finds that the plaintiff has demonstrated a reasonable probability of success on the merits and that irreparable harm would occur if a preliminary injunction did not issue. The court also finds that the balance of the harms tips in favor of issuing a preliminary injunction. The court concludes that the motion for preliminary injunction is granted.
