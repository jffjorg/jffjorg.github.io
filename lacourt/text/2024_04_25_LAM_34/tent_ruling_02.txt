        The
Court questions the scope and number of objections filed by both sides.  In Nazir v. United Airlines, Inc. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 243. the
“litigants file[d] blunderbuss objections to virtually every item of evidence
submitted. This is hardly good advocacy, and it unnecessarily overburdens the
trial court.” (Id at p. 254, fn. 3.) 

 
        Further, “[w]e sometimes ‘hear’ that a common practice in
cases staffed by multiple levels of lawyers is to assign the most junior lawyer
to ‘do the objections,’ which was apparently done here. Perhaps a wiser
practice would be to have the most experienced lawyer, presumably with a better
understanding of the law of evidence, deal with the objections.”  (Id. at p. 257, fn. 6.)  
 
 
 
II.      
Legal Standard
 
“A party to an
arbitration agreement may file in the court in the county in which an
arbitration proceeding is pending, or if an arbitration proceeding has not
commenced, in any proper court, an application for a provisional remedy in
connection with an arbitrable controversy, but only upon the ground that the
award to which the applicant may be entitled may be rendered ineffectual
without provisional relief. The application shall be accompanied by a complaint
or by copies of the demand for arbitration and any response thereto. If
accompanied by a complaint, the application shall also be accompanied by a
statement stating whether the party is or is not reserving the party’s right to
arbitration.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.8, subd. (b).)
 
“As used in this section, ‘provisional
remedy’ includes the following: . . . (3) Preliminary injunctions and temporary
restraining orders issued pursuant to Section 527.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.8,
subd. (a)(3).)
 
“A preliminary
injunction may be granted at any time before judgment upon a verified
complaint, or upon affidavits if the complaint in the one case, or the
affidavits in the other, show satisfactorily that sufficient grounds exist
therefor. No preliminary injunction shall be granted without notice to the
opposing party.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 527, subd. (a).)
 
“[T]rial courts should evaluate two interrelated factors when
deciding whether or not to issue a preliminary injunction.¿The first is
the likelihood that the plaintiff will prevail on the merits at trial. The
second is the interim harm that the plaintiff is likely to¿sustain if the
injunction were denied as compared to the harm that the¿defendant is likely to
suffer if the preliminary injunction were issued.” (IT Corp. v. Cnty. of
Imperial (1983) 35 Cal.3d 63, 69–70, citations omitted.)
 
“Thus, the court examines all of the material before it¿in
order to consider ‘whether a greater injury will result to the defendant from
granting the injunction than to the plaintiff from refusing it’ . . . In making
that determination the court will consider the probability of the plaintiff's
ultimately prevailing in the case and, it has been said, will deny a
preliminary injunction unless there is a reasonable probability that plaintiff
will be successful in the assertion of his rights.” (Cont’l Baking Co. v.
Katz (1968) 68 Cal.2d 512, 528, quoting Santa Cruz Fair Bldg. Ass’n. v.
Grant (1894) 104 Cal. 306, 308, other citations omitted.)
 
“The ultimate goal of any test to be used in deciding whether
a preliminary injunction should issue is to minimize the harm which an erroneous
interim decision may cause.” (IT Corp., supra, 35 Cal.3d at p.
73.)
 
“In seeking a preliminary injunction, [the
party seeking the injunction bears] the burden of demonstrating both likely
success on the merits and the occurrence of irreparable harm.” (Savage v.
Trammell Crow Co. (1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 1562, 1571; Citizens for Better
Streets v. Bd. of Sup'rs of City and Cnty. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 1, 6.)
 
“The law is well settled that the decision to grant a
preliminary injunction rests in the sound discretion of the trial court.” (IT
Corp., supra, 35 Cal.3d at p. 69.)
 
III.    
Discussion
 
A. 
    The Parties’ Arguments
 
Plaintiff moves the Court to issue a
preliminary injunction. (Motion, pp. 2–4.)
 
Plaintiff argues: (1) that a preliminary
injunction is necessary to prevent ongoing harm to the Plaintiff; (2) that
Plaintiff is likely to prevail on the merits; (3) that Defendant is engaging in
trademark infringement and unfair competition; (4) that Defendant is tortiously
interfering with Plaintiff’s prospective economic relations; (5) that Plaintiff
has made a presumptive showing of irreparable harm; (6) that the balance of
harms favors Plaintiff; (7) that an injunction is necessary to prevent the
arbitration from being rendered ineffectual; and (8) that Defendant cannot avoid
an injunction by disputing termination. (Motion, pp. 15:19–20, 16:11–13,
18:11–12, 20:1–2, 22:5–6, 22:12–13.)
 
Defendant opposes the Motion, arguing: (1)
that Plaintiff is not likely to prevail on the merits; (2) that Defendant is
not engaged in trademark infringement or unfair competition; (3) that Defendant
is not tortiously interfering with Plaintiff’s prospective economic advantage;
(4) that Plaintiff cannot show irreparable harm; (5) that Defendant would face
greater harm if the Court granted the preliminary injunction than Plaintiff
would face if the injunction was denied; and (6) that Plaintiff should not be
allowed to circumvent the arbitration proceeding by way of preliminary
injunction where there is no showing that they cannot obtain full relief at
arbitration should they prevail. (Opposition, pp. 5:13, 5:19, 6:20–21, 8:1,
13:7–8, 14:5–7.)
 
In her Reply, Plaintiff argues: (1) that the
government loan unilaterally taken out by Defendant for unknown purposes is not
“Acquisition Debt”; and (2) reiterates its prior arguments. (Reply, pp.
5:24–25, 6:15–16, 9:20–21, 10:7–8, 11:9, 13:1.)
 
B. 
    The Likelihood of Plaintiff Prevailing on
the Merits at Trial
 
The issue at hand hinges on a contract
dispute. Specifically, it appears that three things need to be true for
Plaintiff to prevail in this litigation: 
 
(1)      
Plaintiff needs to have correctly ascertained that
the contract allows for Plaintiff to accelerate a full pay-off of the loan in
the case of Defendant’s breach via default;
 
(2)      
Defendant needs to have breached via default; and 
 
(3)      
Plaintiff needs to have fully paid off the loan. 
 
Has Plaintiff demonstrated a reasonable
probability of these three things?
 
Based on the evidence presented to the Court
at this time, the answer is “yes.”
 
1. 
    Acceleration Due to Default Under the
Contract
 
The Secured Subordinated Promissory Note
defines and provides for what occurs in the “Event of Default”:
 
“6.    Events of Default.      The occurrence of any one or more of the
following events shall constitute an event of default hereunder (‘Event of
Default’):
 
“(a) If Buyer shall
fail to pay when due any payment of principal or interest on this Note and such
failure continues for fifteen (15) days after Holder notifies Buyer thereof in
writing.
 
“(b) If Buyer,
after the date hereof, shall (i) become insolvent or generally fail to pay, or
admit in writing its inability or unwillingness generally to pay, its debts as
they become due, (ii) apply for, consent to, or acquiesce in the appointment of
a trustee, receiver, sequestrator or other custodian for any substantial part
of the assets or other property of any such person, or make a general
assignment for the benefit of creditors, (iii) in the absence of such
application, consent or acquiesce to or permit or suffer to exist, the
appointment of a trustee, receiver, sequestrator or other custodian for a
substantial part of the property of any thereof, and such trustee, receiver,
sequestrator or other custodian shall not be discharged within ninety (90)
days, or (iv) permit or suffer to exist the commencement of any bankruptcy,
reorganization, debt arrangement or other case or proceeding under any
bankruptcy or insolvency law or any dissolution, winding up or liquidation
proceeding, in respect thereof, and, if any such case or proceeding is not
commenced by such person, such case or proceeding shall be consented to or
acquiesced in by such person, or shall result in the entry of an order for
relief or shall remain for ninety (90) days undismissed.”
 
“7.    Remedies Upon Event of Default.       Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default
hereunder, Holder at its option, may declare the entire unpaid principal
balance and all unpaid accrued interest owing on this Note, due and payable
immediately, without further presentment, demand, protest, notice, grace, or
action of any nature whatsoever, all of which are specifically waived by
Buyer.”
 
(Decl. Kinkade, Exh. B, Secured Subordinated Promissory Note, pp. 2–3
[actual pages 87–88 of 263].)
 
        As Plaintiff correctly
argues, the contractual language indicates that a default (defined as failure
to pay payment of principal or interest for fifteen days after notice in
writing) allows Plaintiff to accelerate a full pay-off of the loan in the case
of Defendant’s breach via default.
 
2. 
    Defendant’s Breach of the Contract Via
Default
 
Plaintiff declared under penalty of perjury
that Defendant missed multiple royalty payments and still has not paid certain
interest payments. (Decl. Kinkade, ¶¶ 29–31, 35–38.) Plaintiff also declared
under penalty of perjury that, through her attorneys, she gave Defendant the
required notices of the same. (Ibid.) 
 
Defendant’s Chairman, Mark Mickelson,
declares that Defendant “is current and has paid all Royalties due to the
Kinkades” and “is compliant with all other material obligations under the
[contract].” (Decl. Mickelson, ¶¶ 21–22.) Notably, Defendant has not provided
any documentary evidence of these royalty payments, and Declarant Mickelson’s
declaration does not address the issue of the allegedly unpaid interest
payments. 
 
The Court has examined all of the material
before it and it appears that there is sufficient evidence for Plaintiff to
show that Defendant breached the contract via default. (Cont’l Baking Co.,
supra, 68 Cal.2d at p. 528.) 
 
3. 
    Plaintiff’s Full Payment of the Acquisition
Debt
 
The remaining part of Defendant’s argument is
that Plaintiff did not and has not fully accelerated and paid off the contract
because not all of the “Acquisition Debt” (i.e., the loans Defendant took out
in order to initially pay for its interest in managing the intellectual
property at issue) have been paid off. (Opposition, pp. 1:15–2:13 [including
fn. 3–4], 3:20–4:3.)
 
According to Defendant, Defendant initially
received financing (i.e., incurred “Acquisition Debt”) from Breakaway Capital
Management, LLC. (Decl. Mickelson, ¶ 5.) Defendant provides a copy of this
financing agreement, and Plaintiff’s signature is on this financing agreement.
(Decl. Mickelson, Exh. 1 [actual page 132 of 376].)
 
According to Defendant, Defendant later
received refinancing through AvidBank. (Decl. Mickelson, ¶ 10.) Defendant
provides a copy of this refinancing agreement, and Plaintiff’s signature is
also on this refinancing agreement. (Decl. Mickelson, Exh. 2 [actual page 216
of 376].)
 
According to Defendant, Defendant later
received refinancing through United States Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP
Loans”) and Economic Injury Disaster Loans (“EIDL Loans”). (Decl. Mickelson, ¶
13.) Also, according to Defendant, the PPP Loans and EIDL Loans “replaced the
AvidBank Financing Agreements with re-financing . . . making those related loan
documents the operative Financing Agreements.” (Ibid.) Notably,
Defendant does not provide a copy of any documentation regarding the PPP Loans
or the EIDL Loans, much less any documentation that indicates Plaintiff knew
about and signed off on those loans. 
 
The issue here is that the Parties’ contract
does not allow non-mutual modifications. 
 
“8.5  Modification;
Waiver. No provision of this Note may
be amended, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified except by a written
agreement mutually executed by Buyer and Holder, and subject to the terms of
the Subordination Agreement. Neither any failure nor any delay by Buyer or
Holder in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Note or any of
the documents referred to in this Note will operate as a waiver of such right,
power or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power
or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power
or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. To the
maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (a) no waiver that may be given by
Buyer or Holder will be applicable except in the specific instance for which it
is given, and (b) no notice to or demand on Buyer or Holder will be deemed to
be a waiver of any obligation of that party or of the right of the party giving
such notice or demand to take further action without notice or demand as
provided in this Note.” (Decl. Kinkade, Exh. B, Secured Subordinated Promissory
Note, p. 4 [actual page 89 of 263].)
 
        Defendant has not provided
any evidence, other than his own statement, that there was actually a PPP Loan
or an EIDL Loan to refinance the underlying Acquisition Debt. Because Plaintiff
paid the remainder of the refinanced amount, it appears that Plaintiff has
fully paid off the Acquisition Debt. (Decl. Kinkade, ¶ 42.)
 
        Furthermore, even if
Defendant had taken out a PPP Loan (which has allegedly been forgiven) and an
EIDL Loan (which allegedly remains outstanding), there is no evidence that
Plaintiff was aware of and mutually agreed to use it as a modification of the
underlying contract between the Parties. Thus, based on the evidence presented
to the Court at this time, it appears that any EIDL Loan that does exist would
be the sole responsibility of Defendant, not Plaintiff. 
 
In summary, Plaintiff has submitted
sufficient evidence to the Court to meet her burden of demonstrating a
reasonable probability of success on the merits. (Savage, supra,
223 Cal.App.3d at p. 1571.)
 
C. 
    Balance of the Relative Harms
 
Based on the evidence submitted on the Court
at this time, and only for the purposes of considering a preliminary
injunction, the Court considers the following. 
 
·                
The Parties entered into a contract. 
 
·                
The contract allowed for acceleration and full
payment by Plaintiff of remaining debts if Defendant breached the contract via
default. 
 
·                
Defendant breached the contract via default. 
 
·                
Plaintiff accelerated payments and made full payment
on the contract. 
 
·                
The contract is now terminated, and Defendant has no
rights under the contract. 
 
        Plaintiff has testified to
various harms that would occur if Defendant were to continue managing the
intellectual property at issue. According to Plaintiff, such irreparable harms
include but are not limited to: (1) damage to the reputation of the late Thomas
Kinkade, the creator of all of this intellectual property; (2) damage to
relationships between Plaintiff and licensees and sublicensees; and (3) loss of
licensing income that will never be recovered. (Decl. Kinkade, ¶¶ 57, 62.)
 
Defendant has testified to various harms that
would occur if Plaintiff were to receive the injunction. According to
Defendant, such irreparable harms include but are not limited to: (1)
termination of all of Defendant’s employees; and (2) termination of all ongoing
commercial relationships related to the intellectual property. (Decl.
Mickelson, ¶¶ 27–28.)
 
        While the Court is concerned
about the livelihoods of the employees and commercial relationships of the
businesses at issue, Defendants’ business arises from the intellectual property
of the late Thomas Kinkade. Plaintiff, who controls Kinkade’s intellectual
property, is also trying to protect his reputation. The evidence before the
Court indicates that much greater damage could befall Kinkade’s reputation than
might befall Defendants’ lucrative businesses, and for that reason alone the
balance of the harms should tip in favor of a preliminary injunction. 
 
        In addition, and
independently, the evidence before the Court indicates that Defendant no longer
has any rights under the contract. That alone would tip the balance of the
harms in favor of Plaintiff, and greatly so. 
 
        Upon considering all of the
evidence presented, the Court determines that Plaintiff has demonstrated a
reasonable probability of success on the merits, that irreparable harm would
occur if a preliminary injunction did not issue, and that the balance of the
harms tips in favor of issuing a preliminary injunction (i.e., that greater
injury will result from a preliminary injunction not issuing). 
 
        The Court ISSUES a
preliminary injunction. 
 
IV.     
Conclusion
 
The Motion for Preliminary Injunction is
GRANTED.  Plaintiff to prepare the order
for the Court.
