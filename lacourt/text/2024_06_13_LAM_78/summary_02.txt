And here is the English summary:

Judge Hon. Jill Feeney has issued a tentative ruling regarding Defendant HOA Specialists Construction Services, Inc.'s motion to stay proceedings in the case of Luis Morales vs. HOA Specialists Construction Services, Inc. (Case No. 23STCV27567). The court has denied the motion to stay proceedings. The defendant seeks to stay the proceedings due to a pending criminal case related to the same events as the Cross-Complaint. However, the court has determined that the factors do not weigh in favor of a stay. The court has considered the factors set forth in Avant! Corp. v. Superior Court (2000) and Keating v. Office of Thrift Supervision (1995), including whether the party seeking the stay's Fifth Amendment rights are implicated, the interest of the party opposing the stay in proceeding expeditiously with the litigation, and the convenience of the court in managing its cases. The court has found that the factors do not weigh in favor of a stay, as Morales is not invoking his Fifth Amendment rights and there is no evidence that HOA would be prejudiced if the proceedings continue.
