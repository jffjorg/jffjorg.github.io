The judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer filed by the defendants, Monica Potter, Sabrina Coryell, and Kevin Dwight, against the complaint filed by the plaintiff, Paul William Pilger.

The judge finds that the settlement agreement and separation agreement signed by the plaintiff in 2018 release the defendants from all causes of action arising out of their actions involving the trusts. The judge also finds that the alleged interference was not wrongful and that the claims against Defendant Kevin Dwight are time-barred. The judge grants the defendants' request for judicial notice and orders them to give notice of the ruling. The plaintiff has the option to amend the complaint to address the issues raised in the demurrer.
