  Case Number:  20STCV17442    Hearing Date:   October 6, 2023    Dept:  74 Chicago
Title Insurance Company v. Neil Stiller, et al.
Motion to Tax Costs
The
court considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply.
TENTATIVE RULING
            The court grants this motion to tax
costs in part.
BACKGROUND 
            This
action arises from a dispute over real property.
            On
May 7, 2020, Plaintiff Chicago Title Insurance Company (Plaintiff) filed a
complaint against Defendants Neil and Kimberly Stiller (Defendants).
            On
July 17, 2023, the court entered a notice of entry of judgment. Defendants were
the prevailing party. 
            On
July 27, 2023, Defendants filed a memorandum of costs.
            On
August 16, 2023, Plaintiff filed this motion to tax costs.
LEGAL STANDARD
            A
prevailing party is entitled to recover costs, including attorneys’ fees, as a
matter of right, except as otherwise expressly provided by statute. (¿¿See Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 1032, subd. (a)(4), 1032, subd. (b), 1033.5¿¿.)¿Costs
recoverable under¿¿section 1032¿¿are restricted to those that are both
reasonable in amount and reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation.
(¿Code Civ. Proc.,¿§§ 1033.5, subd. (c)(2), (3)¿.)¿Costs “¿merely convenient or
beneficial¿” to the preparation of a case are disallowed. (¿Code Civ. Proc., §
1033.5, subd. (c)(2)¿.)  
            “¿A
‘verified memorandum of costs is prima facie evidence of [the] propriety’ of
the items listed on it, and the burden is on the party
challenging these costs to demonstrate that they were not reasonable or
necessary.¿” (¿¿Adams v. Ford Motor Co. (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 1475,
1486-1487 [italics and brackets omitted]¿¿.)¿Costs otherwise allowable as a
matter of right may be disallowed if the court determines they were not
reasonably necessary, and the court has power to reduce the amount of any cost
item to an amount that is reasonable. (See Perko’s Enterprises, Inc. v. RRNS
Enterprises¿(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 238, 245 [finding that¿“the intent and
effect of section 1033.5, subdivision¿(c)(2) is to authorize a trial court to
disallow recovery of costs, including filing fees, when it determines the costs
were incurred unnecessarily”].)¿
DISCUSSION  
            In
its motion, Plaintiff argues that many of the items in Defendants’ memorandum
of costs lack evidentiary support or are suspect. In opposition, Defendants
provided evidentiary support and justification for each item at issue.
Plaintiff has conceded in its reply that Defendants provided sufficient
evidence and support for some of the requests. Accordingly, the court will not
address the items that are no longer in dispute. Be that as it may, Plaintiff
still challenges the following costs:
            $100.20
– Service of Process for Deposition of Fidelity National Law Group
            Plaintiff claims there is no documentary
proof that Defendants incurred this cost. However, Defendants have provided the
invoice. (Flores Decl.; Ex. E.) Plaintiff further
notes that personal service of Plaintiff’s counsel was not necessary. In
opposition, Defendants concede that the parties agrees that Defendants would
serve attorney Karen Ragland instead of individual third-party witnesses. Service
by email would have sufficed. Accordingly, the court will tax this cost.
            $306.00
– Courtesy Copy of Opposition to MSJ
            Plaintiff argues there is no
documentary proof that Defendants incurred this cost and Defendants have not
explained why a courtesy copy or messenger were necessary. But Defendants have
provided the invoice. (Flores Decl.; Ex. F.) Moreover, it is the court’s
understanding that a previous order from Department 74 required courtesy
copies. Accordingly, the court will not tax this cost. 
            $1,050.46
– 3 Payments for Demurrer Filing
            Plaintiff points out that Defendants
have not explained why Defendants required three payments for the filing of a
demurrer. However, Defendants have provided client invoices accounting for all
three payments. (Flores Decl., Ex. J; Ex. K; Ex. L.) The court will not tax
this cost.
