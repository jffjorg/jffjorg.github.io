 Case Number:  22STCP04254    Hearing Date:   October 6, 2023    Dept:  74 In the
Matter of Paul William Pilger
Demurrer
The
court considered the moving papers. No opposition was timely filed with the
court, although Plaintiff evidentially served an opposition on Defendants. (See
Reply p. 4)
TENTATIVE RULING
            The court sustains this demurrer
with leave to amend.
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE.
            The court grants Defendants’ request
for judicial notice.
BACKGROUND  
            This
action arises from a contractual dispute.
            On
November 30, 2022, Plaintiff Paul William Pilger (Plaintiff) filed a complaint
against Defendants Monica Potter, Sabrina Coryell, and Kevin Dwight
(Defendants). The complaint alleges intentional and/or negligent interference
with prospective economic advantage. 
            On
March 23, 2023, Defendants filed this demurrer.
LEGAL STANDARD
            A
demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable.
(¿¿Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318¿¿.) “¿To survive a
demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of
action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the
plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.¿” (¿¿C.A. v. William S. Hart Union
High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872¿¿.) For the purpose of testing
the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all
material facts properly pleaded. (¿Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992)
2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967¿.) A demurrer “¿does not admit contentions, deductions
or conclusions of fact or law.¿” (¿¿Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67
Cal.2d 695, 713¿¿.) 
            A
pleading is uncertain if it is ambiguous or unintelligible. (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.10, subd. (f).) A demurrer for uncertainty may lie if the failure to label
the parties and claims renders the complaint so confusing defendant cannot tell
what he or she is supposed to respond to. 
(Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135,
139, fn. 2.) However, “[a] demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even
where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be
clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (¿Khoury v. Maly's of
California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616¿.)
DISCUSSION  
            The
Releases Plaintiff Signed Bar His Claims for Intentional and Negligent    Interference with Prospective Economic
Advantage.
 
            In support of their demurrer,
Defendants direct the court’s attention to a settlement agreement and a
separation agreement, which Plaintiff signed in 2018. (Klein
Decl., ¶¶ 2, 3; Ex. A; Ex. B.) Under the agreements, Plaintiff releases and
discharges trustees and, among others, their agents, representatives, and
attorneys from all causes of action arising out of their actions involving the
Administrative Trust, Survivor’s Trust, and the Revocable Trust. (Klein Decl.,
¶¶ 2, 3; Ex. A, § 7; Ex. B, § 7.) This release covers Defendant Sabrina
Coryell, who is listed in the agreements as a trustee, and Defendant Monica
Potter, who is listed in the agreements as the CEO of a co-trustee. The release
also covers Defendant Kevin Dwight, an attorney acting on behalf of the trust.
(Complaint, pp. 21-23.) And most important, the release also applies to Plaintiff’s
causes of action here. 
            Plaintiff
alleges Defendants coerced him to enter the agreements. (Complaint,
pp. 23, 30-31.) First, Defendants allegedly told
Plaintiff that if he did not sign the agreements, he would receive nothing from
the trust. (Complaint, pp. 19, 23.) But as Defendants note, “it does not
constitute duress or coercion to threaten to do that which a party has a legal
right to do.” (Marshall v. Packard-Bell Co. (1951) 106 Cal.App.2d 770,
774.) Second, Defendants allegedly told Plaintiff that if he further
disputed his entitlement to trust assets, Defendants would conduct discovery
and investigate the disappearance of items from the estate’s properties to
which Plaintiff had access. (Complaint, p. 20.) However, the threat of taking
legal action generally does not constitute coercion or duress. (Leeper v.
Beltrami (1959) 53 Cal.2d 195, 204.) Thus, Plaintiff has not alleged
conduct by Defendants that renders the settlement agreement void or voidable. 
            Plaintiff
Has Not Alleged Facts Sufficient to Support His Causes of Action      Intentional and Negligent Interference with
Prospective Economic Advantage.
 
            The
elements for these causes of action are as follows: (1) an economic
relationship between the plaintiff and some third party, with the probability
of future economic benefit to the plaintiff; (2) the defendant's knowledge of
the relationship; (3) intentional or negligent acts on the part of the
defendant designed to disrupt the relationship; (4) actual disruption of the
relationship; and (5) economic harm to the plaintiff proximately caused by the
acts of the defendant. (Crown Imports, LLC v. Superior Court (2014) 223
Cal.App.4th 1395, 1404.) In addition, the alleged interference must have been
wrongful by some measure beyond the fact of the interference itself. (Della
Penna v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. (1995) 11 Cal.4th 376, 392-393.) 
            Here,
Plaintiff alleges he and Gwynneth Weiss entered a contract, which guaranteed
him lifetime employment, a condominium, and a bequest of $150,000. (Complaint,
p. 7-8.) Plaintiff further alleges that Defendants interfered with this
contract by coercing him into entering a settlement and separation agreement
with the Estate of Gwynneth Weiss. (Complaint, pp. 19, 20, 23, 30, 31.)
Moreover, the agreements excluded what the prior contract promised—namely,
lifetime employment and the condominium. (Complaint, p. 17.) But Defendants note
Plaintiff has not alleged that the interference was wrongful because their
threats that (1) Plaintiff would receive nothing from the trust if he did not
sign the agreements and (2) they would aggressively pursue discovery in
litigation, were not unlawful. (Complaint, pp. 19, 20, 23; (Marshall v.
Packard-Bell Co. supra, 106 Cal.App.2d at p. 774 [“[I]t does not constitute
duress or coercion to threaten to do that which a party has a legal right to
do.”]; Leeper v. Beltrami, supra, 53 Cal.2d at
p. 204.)
            Next,
Defendants note a cause of action for interference with prospective economic
advantage cannot lie against a party to the contract. (Kelly
v. General Telephone Co. (1982) 136 Cal.App.3d 278, 288; Applied
Equipment Corp. v. Litton Saudi Arabia Ltd. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 503, 514.) Plaintiff
alleges a contractual relationship with Gwynneth Weiss. (Complaint, p. 25.) Upon
Weiss’s death, Plaintiff would have been in a contractual relationship with the
Weiss Estate. Defendant Sabrina Coryell is a trustee of the Gwynneth Weiss Administrative Trust. (Klein Decl., ¶ 2;
Ex. A.) Moreover, Defendant Monica Potter is the CEO of a co-trustee of the
Gwynneth Weiss Administrative Trust. (Klein Decl., ¶ 2;
Ex. A.) And Defendant Kevin Dwight is an attorney acting on behalf of the
trust. (Complaint, pp. 21-23.) As such, they are agents of the Weiss Estate and
cannot be third parties to the alleged contract between Plaintiff and the Weiss
Estate. (See Kelly v. General Telephone Co., surpa, 136 Cal.App.3d at p.
288.) 
            Plaintiff’s
Causes of Action Against Defendant Kevin Dwight Are Time-Barred
            Plaintiff
has not alleged facts suggesting attorney Defendant Kevin Dwight provided his
services anywhere other than California, thus California’s statute of
limitations applies. Under Code of Civil Procedure section 340.6, subdivision
(a): “An action against an attorney for a wrongful act or omission . . . arising
in the performance of professional services shall be commenced within one year
after the plaintiff discovers or . . . should have discovered, the facts
constituting the wrongful act or omission, or four years from the date of the
wrongful act or omission, whichever occurs first.” Plaintiff does not allege
Wright committed any misconduct after the June 14, 2018 signing of the
settlement agreement. (Complaint, p. 22-24; Klein Decl., ¶ 2; Ex. A.) Plaintiff
filed his complaint on November 30, 2022. Thus, Plaintiff’s claims against
Defendant Kevin Dwight are barred.

CONCLUSION 
Based
on the foregoing, the court sustains Defendants’ demurrer with leave to amend.
Defendants
are ordered to give notice.
