Summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion for a protective order to prevent Robert Tafoya from taking depositions and disqualifying him from serving as counsel for the defendants. The court found that the plaintiff has not persuaded it that she genuinely needs Tafoya as a witness. The plaintiff had argued that Tafoya's testimony was necessary to support her claims of defamation and whistleblower retaliation, but the court held that she can obtain this evidence from other witnesses. The court also found that Tafoya serving as counsel would not compromise the integrity of the judicial process and that the defendants have a right to representation by counsel of their choice.
