```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the first amended complaint and the motion to strike. The demurrer is sustained as to the first cause of action for elder abuse and neglect, as the allegations are too conclusory and do not state a claim. The demurrer is overruled as to the second cause of action for violation of Residents' Bill of Rights, as the allegations are sufficient to state a claim.

The court grants the motion to strike paragraphs 44 and 45, which describe different violations/citations issued by the DPH, as they are not relevant to the case. The court also grants the motion to strike Plaintiff's request for punitive damages, as Plaintiff fails to allege fraud, oppression, or malice with the requisite specificity.

The court denies the motion to strike Plaintiff's request for costs and attorneys' fees, as both are recoverable under Health and Safety Code section 1430(b).

The court gives the Plaintiff 20 days to amend their complaint.
