And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Maria De La Luz Santacruz's motion to compel the deposition of Philip Holguin-Caban, a former employee of Defendant Aldi Inc. The judge has denied the motion, finding that Defendant has not shown that Holguin-Caban is incapable of testifying due to cognitive impairment. The judge also notes that Plaintiff did not issue a subpoena to Holguin-Caban, and therefore cannot compel him to appear and testify at a deposition. Additionally, the judge has declined to impose sanctions on Defendant and its counsel, citing a lack of evidence to support the request.
