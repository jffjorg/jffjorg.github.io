Plaintiff U.S. Bank National
Association (“Plaintiff”) filed this action on May 30, 2024, to recover
possession of a 2020 Mercedes-Benz C300, VIN No. W1KWF8DB9LR579143. Plaintiff
seeks a default judgment with the remedy of replevin. Since the sole remedy
requested is possession, and there is no calculation or request of damages, the
Court revises Item 8 of the proposed order on Form JUD-100 to remove the
following: “The proceeds of the sale of the property will be applied to the
damages.” Notwithstanding this edit, the application for default judgment is
GRANTED.
