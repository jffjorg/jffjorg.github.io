I.      INTRODUCTION
AND BACKGROUND
Petitioner Mic-Bry8, LLC (“Petitioner”) seeks court approval
of a proposed transfer of structured settlement payments. A direct or indirect
transfer of structured settlement payment rights is not effective unless the
transfer has been approved by a court order finding the following:¿
(1)   The transfer is in the best interest of the payee,
considering the welfare and support of the payee’s dependents.
 
(2)   The payee has been advised in writing by the transferee to
seek independent professional advice regarding the transfer and has either
received that advice or knowingly waived, in writing, the opportunity to
receive the advice.
 
(3)   The transferee has complied with the notification
requirements pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (f), the transferee has
provided the payee with a disclosure form that complies with Section 10136, and
the transfer agreement complies with Sections 10136 and 10138.
 
(4)   The transfer does not contravene any applicable statute or
the order of any court or other government authority.
 
(5)   The payee understands the terms of the transfer agreement,
including the terms set forth in the disclosure statement required by Section
10136.
 
(6)   The payee understands and does not wish to exercise the
payee’s right to cancel the transfer agreement.
 
 
(Ins. Code, §§ 10137, 10139.5.)¿ 
As a result of a personal injury
settlement, Payee Carlota Estrada  (“Payee”)
became entitled to certain structured settlement payments. Payee and Petitioner
have entered into a transfer agreement, under which Payee is to sell 240
monthly life-contingent payments of $380 beginning January 15, 2025 through and
including December 15, 2044, totaling $91,200
in exchange for a purchase price of $9,087.07
(Petition, Ex. B ) The discounted present value of the amount being sold
is  $55,656.33,
calculated by applying the 5.2 % discount rate used by the Internal
Revenue Service to value annuities in probate proceedings. The purchase price
was calculated using a discount rate of 53.32
%. If Payee did not sell the right to receive structured settlement payments
but instead borrowed the net amount of $ 9,086.51
and paid that loan back in installments with each of the payments they are now
selling, the equivalent interest rate would be 53.32%
per year. (Ibid.)
All of this information has been
disclosed to Payee by way of the disclosure form in compliance with Insurance
Code § 10136, as required by § 10139.5(a)(3). (Petition, Ex. B
) Payee was advised in writing to seek independent professional advice, both
legal and financial. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(2).) Payee chose not to
seek an independent professional’s advice and understands the terms of the
transfer agreement. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(2), (a)(5); Amended
Petition, Ex. D (“Estrada Decl.”), ¶ 11.)
Payee also understands and does not wish to exercise their right to cancel the
transfer agreement. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(6).) In addition, the
transfer agreement does not contravene any applicable statute or order of any
court or other governmental authority. (Ins. Code § 10139.5(a)(4).) 
II.     REQUIRED
DOCUMENTS 
         Not less than 20 days prior to the
scheduled hearing on any petition for approval of a transfer of structured
settlement payment rights under this article, the transferee shall file with
the court and serve on all interested parties a notice of the proposed transfer
and the petition for its authorization, and shall include the following with
that notice: 
(A)
A copy of the transferee's current petition and any other prior petition,
whether approved or withdrawn, that was filed with the court in accordance with
paragraph (6) of subdivision (c).
 
(B)
A copy of the proposed transfer agreement and disclosure form required by
paragraph (3) of subdivision (a).
 
(C)
A listing of each of the payee's dependents, together with each dependent's
age.
 
(D)
A copy of the disclosure required in subdivision (b) of Section 10136.
 
(E)
A copy of the annuity contract, if available.
 
(F)
A copy of any qualified assignment agreement, if available.
 
(G)
A copy of the underlying structured settlement agreement, if available.
 
(Ins. Code, § 10139..5, subd. (f)(2).) 
 
Copies of the proposed transfer
agreement, disclosure form, and list of Payee’s dependents are attached to the
Amended Petition. The Declaration of Lucia Sanchez, filed concurrently with the
Amended Petition, includes a letter confirming Payee’s benefit schedule with
monthly life-contingent payments of $650, beginning on July 15, 2001. (Declaration
of Lucia Sanchez, Ex. A.) A copy of the underlying settlement agreement could
not be obtained. (Sanchez Decl., ¶ 1(b)(iv).) 
 
III.    INFORMATION
ABOUT PAYEE
Payee is 63
years old. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5(c)(1); Estrada Decl. ¶ 4).
Payee resides at 345 E. Badillo St., Unit B, Covina, CA 91723. (Ibid.)
Payee is single and does not have minor children. (Ins. Code, §§ 10139.5(c)(2)-(c)(3);
Estrada Decl., ¶ 4.)¿ Payee has no child support obligations. (Ins. Code, §
10139.5(c)(5); Estrada Decl., ¶ 4.) Payee receives $1,000 per month in
disability benefits and $650 per month from her annuity. (Ins. Code, §
10139.5(c)(4); Estrada Decl., ¶ 4.) Payee has not previously assigned or
attempted to assign a portion of her structured settlement rights in the last
five years. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5(c)(6); Estrada Decl., ¶ 8.)
In sum, Payee has provided all of the information required by Insurance Code §
10139.5(c). 
In addition, in compliance with
Insurance Code § 1039.5(b), Payee indicates the purpose of the transfer and
their financial and economic situation. (Estrada
Decl., ¶ 6.) Payee states that the funds will be used to
purchase a used vehicle because their current vehicle needs a new transmission.
(Estrada Decl., ¶ 6.) Payee states that it is difficult to save enough money to
purchase a vehicle and that she has no better alternative than to assign a
portion of her annuity payments. (Estrada Decl., ¶ 6.) If the transfer is
approved, Payee will receive a lump sum from Petitioner and continue to receive
$270 a month from her annuity. (Id., ¶ 7.)
The periodic payments are not necessary for day-to-day living expenses or
intended for past/future medical expenses. (Id.,
¶ 3.) 
III.    CONCLUSION
Given the foregoing, the Court finds
that the transfer is fair, reasonable and in the best interest of Payee. (Ins.
Code § 10139.5(a)(1) & (b)(1)-(15).) Accordingly, the petition for approval
of structured settlement payments is GRANTED.
