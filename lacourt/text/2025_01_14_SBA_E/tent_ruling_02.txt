BACKGROUND
            On May 3, 2023,
Plaintiff Patrice Ann Agee filed the Complaint against Defendants City of Los Angeles, Los Angeles
World Airports, County of Los Angeles, State of California, and California
Department of Transportation, 
 
            On October 25, 2023, Plaintiff filed
the First Amended Complaint (FAC), alleging a single cause of action for
premises liability arising from an alleged trip and fall at Los Angeles
International Airport.
 
            On August 14, 2024, Defendants City
of Los Angeles and Los Angeles World Airports filed the instant Motion for
Summary Judgement.

JUDICIAL
NOTICE
            
The Court may take judicial notice of records
of (1) any court of this state or (2) any court of record of the United States
or of any state of the United States. (Evid. Code § 452 subd. (d).) The Court
may also take judicial notice of “Official acts of the legislative, executive, and
judicial departments of the United States and of any state of the United
States.” (Evid. Code § 452 subd. (c).)
            
            Defendants request the Court take
judicial notice of the First Amended Complaint. Plaintiff has not objected to
this request. Therefore, the Court grants the request.
 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
The function of a motion for summary judgment
or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing party
cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an order
of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v. Atlantic
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil Procedure section
437 subdivision (c) “requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all
the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the
evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there
is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp.
(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of the pleadings in a motion
for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the
affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of
fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.” (Juge v. County of
Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI Development, Inc. v.
Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367, 381-382.)  
 
As to each cause of action, as framed by the
complaint, the defendant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication
must satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to show “that one
or more elements of the cause of action ... cannot be established, or that
there is a complete defense to the cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
437c(p)(2); see also Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of
the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence
in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39
Cal.4th 384, 389.)  
 
Once the defendant has met that burden, the
burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more
material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto. To
establish a triable issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must
produce substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)  
 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
Plaintiff
Patricia Agee has been employed with the Department of Homeland Security,
Transportation Security Administration (TSA) at LAX for 16 years, serving as a
Lead Transportation Security Screening Officer for the past four years and a
Transportation Security Officer for the prior 13 years. (UMF 1, 3.) Her duties
include inspecting items that trigger alarms, opening passenger suitcases, and
ensuring no prohibited items are present. (UMF 4.) Plaintiff's work assignments
rotate every six months. (UMF 5.) On May 8, 2022, she began a new rotation in
Terminal 6, having previously been assigned to Terminal 7. (UMF 6.)
 
 The day before the incident, she traversed the
same area approximately three times during her new assignment. (UMF 10.) On May
9, 2022, at around 3:30 a.m., Plaintiff missed the step and fell while leaving
an office to clock in for her shift. At the time of the incident, the step was
painted yellow, but Plaintiff was looking straight ahead rather than at the
floor. (UMF 11,12.)
 
            Cause of Action 1 – Dangerous
Condition of Public Property
 
            A public entity may be liable for a dangerous
condition of public property if the property was in a dangerous condition at
the time of the injury, the dangerous condition caused the injury, the
condition created a reasonably foreseeable risk of the type of injury that
occurred, and either a negligent or wrongful act or omission of an employee
within the scope of their employment created the condition, or the public
entity had actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition in
sufficient time to take measures to protect against it. (Gov. Code § 835; Sun
v. City of Oakland (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 1177, 1183.)
 
            Workers Compensation
 
            Defendants argue that California's
workers' compensation system provides the exclusive remedy for injuries
sustained by employees arising out of and in the course of employment. (Labor
Code §§ 3600, 3602.) This exclusivity extends to all claims derivative of
workplace injuries, barring civil actions regardless of their form. (Huffman
v. Interstate Brands Companies (2004) 121 Cal. App. 4th 679, 694.) An
employee is considered to be in the "course of employment" when
performing duties reasonably connected to their job or benefiting their
employer. (LaTourette v. W.C.A.B. (1998) 17 Cal. 4th 644, 651.) Injuries
are deemed to "arise out of employment" if there is any causal
connection between the job and the injury, even if the employment is only a
contributory cause. (Maher v. Workers’ Comp. Appeals Bd. (1983) 33 Cal.
3d 729, 734.) 
 
Defendants
assert that Plaintiff’s injury occurred while she was walking in an
employee-only area at LAX to clock in for her shift, clearly situating the
incident within the course and scope of her employment. Plaintiff's prior
judicial admissions, including her workers’ compensation claim and discovery
responses, confirm she was acting in her employment capacity at the time of the
incident. This acknowledgment further supports the applicability of the
workers' compensation exclusivity defense.
 
Although
Defendants did not initially include the workers' compensation defense in their
answer, California law permits unpled affirmative defenses to be raised at the
summary judgment stage if the opposing party has adequate notice and
opportunity to respond. Cruey v. Gannett Co. (1998) 64 Cal. App. 4th
356, 367; Nieto v. Blue Shield of California Life & Health Ins. Co. (2010)
181 Cal. App. 4th 60, 75.) Defendants argue Plaintiff had sufficient notice,
given her own workers’ compensation claim and admissions. 
 
Based
on these factors, Defendants contend that the claim is barred under the
workers' compensation exclusivity rule, as Plaintiff’s injury was proximately
caused by her employment and falls squarely within the workers' compensation
system's jurisdiction.
 
            In opposition, Plaintiff argues that
TSA, not LAWA, is her employer, as TSA exercises control over her wages, hours,
and working conditions. (Labor Code §2810.8). TSA is a federal agency,
not a leasing or temporary services employer, further solidifying its employer
status. (California Unemployment Insurance Code §606.5) 
 
Plaintiff
contends that injuries sustained on an employer's premises during employment
are compensable under workers' compensation laws. (Employers Mutual
Liability Insurance Company of Wisconsin v. Industrial Accident Commission, 18
Cal. Comp Cases 286, Nov. 13, 1953). However, Plaintiff asserts that LAWA is
not TSA's premises, and she was merely performing her TSA duties on LAWA
property when the incident occurred.
 
Plaintiff
argues that under California law, workers' compensation does not preclude a
civil action against third parties. (Bailey v. Reliance Ins. Co., 65
Cal. Comp Cases, (2000), Rodgers v. Workers Compensation Appeals Bd. of
California, 49 Cal. Comp. cases 513, (1984); Labor Code § 3852). Workers'
compensation exclusivity applies only between an employee and their employer, in
this case, TSA, not a third-party entity like LAWA.
 
Plaintiff
concludes that LAWA cannot claim the protection of the workers' compensation
exclusivity rule because it is not her employer. LAWA was merely a premises
where Plaintiff performed her duties assigned by TSA, and thus, any claims
against LAWA fall outside the scope of the workers' compensation system.
 
In
reply, Defendants argue that The Workers Compensation Act presumes an
employment relationship if services are rendered, and this presumption applies
to Plaintiff’s dual employment with both TSA and LAWA. (Labor Code § 3357,
3351.) Plaintiff’s emphasis on being employed by TSA does not preclude a
dual-employer relationship, as LAWA had control over her work, including her
rotations, assignments, and workspace.
 
Defendants
highlight that Labor Code § 3602 bars recovery in civil actions against either
employer in a dual-employment scenario. (Wedeck v. Unocal Corp. (1997),
59 Cal. App. 4th 848, 856-857.)  Plaintiff concedes LAWA controlled aspects of
her work, thus establishing an employment relationship. Secondary factors from
the Borello test, such as lack of distinct occupation, no specialized
skill, LAWA-provided tools and workspace, and integration of Plaintiff's work
into LAWA’s operations, further confirm this relationship. (See, S. G.
Borello & Sons, Inc. v. Department of Industrial Relations (1989) 48
Cal.3d 341, 404.) 
 
Defendants
assert that Plaintiff was injured in the course of her employment at an
employee-only area, linking the incident to her work duties. Plaintiff’s
workers’ compensation claim constitutes a judicial admission that her injuries
arose from her employment with LAWA. Defendants maintain that Plaintiff’s sole
remedy lies within the workers' compensation system, regardless of comparative
fault or the intentionality of the conduct.
 
California's
workers' compensation system provides the exclusive remedy for injuries
sustained by employees arising out of and in the course of employment. (Labor
Code §§ 3600, 3602.) “Any person rendering service for another, other than as
an independent contractor, or unless expressly excluded herein, is presumed to
be an employee.” (Labor Code § 3357.) “An employee may have more than one
employer for purposes of workers’ compensation, and, in situations of dual
employers, the second or ‘special’ employer may enjoy the same immunity from a
common law negligence action on account of an industrial injury as does the
first or ‘general’ employer. Identifying and analyzing such situations ‘is one
of the most ancient and complex questions of law in not only compensation but
tort law.'” (Santa Cruz Poultry, Inc. v. Superior Court (1987) 194
Cal.App.3d 575, 578.)
 
The
crucial factor in determining whether a relationship is an employee-employer
relationship is whether the employee is subject to the employer's control and
direction. (Borello, supra, 48 Cal.3d 341, 353. However, the Court also
considers  “(1) the alleged employee's
opportunity for profit or loss depending on his managerial skill; (2) the
alleged employee's investment in equipment or materials required for his task,
or his employment of helpers; (3) whether the service rendered requires a
special skill; (4) the degree of permanence of the working relationship; and
(5) whether the service rendered is an integral part of the alleged employer's
business.” (Id. at 355.)
 
            When determining whether there is
preemption under the Workers Compensation Act, the Court first looks to whether
the injury was sustained by an act arising out of employment. (See Shoemaker
v. Myers (1990) 52 Cal. 3d 1, 15.) If the injury did arise in the course of
employment, the Court then looks to whether it was caused by an intentional act
of an employee; if it was, then the claim is preempted by the Workers
Compensation Act. (Id.) 
 
            Here, regarding Defendant’s control
of Plaintiff, nowhere is it stated the Defendant controls Plaintiff's rotations
at LAX, nor who Plaintiff reports to at LAX. However, it has been shown
Plaintiff has worked at LAX for 16 years, has no opportunity for profit, does
not invest in her equipment and is an integral part of running the business.
While Defendants have shown that many of the secondary factors lay in favor of
a finding of an employee-employer relationship, the crucial factor of control
has not been shown. (See, Borello, supra, 48 Cal.3d 341, 353.)
Therefore, the Court finds that Defendants have not shown that the action is
barred by the Workers Compensation Act. (Labor Code §§ 3600, 3602.)
 
            Dangerous
Condition
 
            Defendants argue that
a landowner is not required to eliminate a dangerous condition if adequate
warning of the danger is provided. A landowner is not an insurer of safety and
can assume that individuals will recognize and avoid obvious hazards. (Denieley
v. Goldmine Ski Associates, Inc. (1998) 218 Cal. App. 3d 111, 121.) “If a
danger is so apparent that an invitee can reasonably be expected to notice and
protect against it, the condition itself serves as an adequate warning.” (Matherne
v. Los Feliz Theatre (1942) 53 Cal. App. 2d 660, 666.)
 
Defendants contend that Plaintiff had
sufficient warning of the step where the incident occurred. Plaintiff had
walked up the step approximately 20 minutes before the fall and three times the
day before. Additionally, the step was painted yellow to warn of its presence.
Plaintiff admitted she fell because she was not looking at the floor but was
looking straight ahead. Defendants conclude that the step was an open and
obvious condition, for which Plaintiff received adequate warning, precluding
liability for the incident.
 
In opposition, Plaintiff argues that even if
the step qualifies as an “open and obvious” condition, Defendants still have a
duty to remedy the danger if it is foreseeable that the condition could cause
injury, especially when necessity requires individuals to encounter it. (Osborn
v. Mission Ready Mix (1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 104.) Despite Defendant's claims
that the step was adequately marked, Plaintiff contends the yellow tape was
dusty and worn, the area was poorly lit, and Defendants failed to provide proper
warnings or illumination.
 
Plaintiff acknowledges familiarity with the
step but notes prior encounters were in daylight, contrasting with the
incident’s poor lighting. Plaintiff asserts Defendant’s failure to address the
step’s condition constituted a breach of duty, directly causing her injuries.
 
Plaintiff also contends that liability for
dangerous conditions does not depend on the user’s due care but rather on
whether the property posed a significant risk. Comparative negligence, if any,
should only reduce damages and is unrelated to determining Defendant’s
liability. Since reasonable inferences could be drawn in Plaintiff’s favor,
summary judgment cannot be granted. Plaintiff concludes that the Court cannot
determine her conduct as negligent as a matter of law, emphasizing that
questions of contributory negligence must be left to the trier of fact. (See, Sparks
v. Allen Northridge Market (1959) 176 Cal.App.2d. 694, 700-701.)
 
While Defendants argue that a landowner is not
required to eliminate a dangerous hazard if an adequate warning is provided,
Plaintiff has shown even when a danger is open and obvious, a landowner still
has a duty to remedy the danger if it may cause injury. (Osborn, supra, 224
Cal.App.3d 104 115-116.) Thus, the Court finds that Defendants have not met
their burden of proof to show that one or more of the elements of the cause of
action cannot be proven. (Scalf, supra, 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) 
 
Therefore, the Court denies the Motion for
Summary Judgement.
