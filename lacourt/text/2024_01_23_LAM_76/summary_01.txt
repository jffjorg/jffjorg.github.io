Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions filed by the plaintiff, Earl Glen Harmon. The first motion is for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint, and the second motion is for an order partitioning real property and to quiet title against the deceased domestic partner's interest. The judge has granted the first motion, allowing the plaintiff to file a stand-alone copy of the Second Amended Complaint, which shall be deemed served as of the date of the order. The judge has also required the plaintiff to file a separate declaration in support of the motion, which must specify the effect of the amendment, why it is necessary and proper, when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered, and why the request for amendment was not made earlier. The judge has not made a decision on the second motion, as it will be heard at a later date.
