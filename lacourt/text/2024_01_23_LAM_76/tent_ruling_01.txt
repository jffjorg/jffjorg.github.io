ANALYSIS
Motion For Leave To File First Amended Complaint
Discussion
Plaintiff Earl Glenn Harmon moves
for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint.
Plaintiff
seeks to remove to causes of action from his complaint.
“Leave to amend is in general required to be
liberally granted (citation omitted), provided there is no statute of limitations
concern. Leave to amend may be denied if there is prejudice to the opposing
party, such as delay in trial, loss of critical evidence, or added costs of
preparation. (Citation omitted.)”  (Kolani v. Gluska (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th
402.)  Where an
additional theory of liability is proposed against an existing defendant, this
is not prejudice which would justify the denial of leave to amend. (See
Hirsa v. Superior Court
(1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 486, 490. See also Atkinson
v. Elk Corp. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th
739, 761: “[I]t is irrelevant that new legal theories are
introduced as long as the proposed amendments 'relate to the same general set
of facts.' [Citation.]" (Citation omitted.))
The proposed deletions are set forth at Pages
3:14 – 4:9 of the motion.
Moreover, Cal. Rules of Court Rule
3.1324(b) states:
A separate declaration must accompany
the motion and must specify:
 
(1)  The effect of the
amendment;
 
(2)  Why the amendment is
necessary and proper;
 
(3)  When the facts giving
rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and
 
(4)  The reasons why the
request for amendment was not made earlier. 

   (Cal. Rules of Court, 3.1324(b).)
            The
Declaration of Margaret Reyes sufficiently complies with Rule 3.1324, in light
of the fact that only deletions are proposed.
            Plaintiff’s
motion for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint is GRANTED. Plaintiff is to
file a stand-alone copy of the Second Amended Complaint, which shall be deemed
served as of the date of this order.
