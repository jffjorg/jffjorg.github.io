[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING AS MOOT MOTION
  TO QUASH SUBPOENAS; GRANTING MOTION TO SET ASIDE DEFAULT
 
Dept. 48

MOTION TO QUASH SUBPOENAS

On
May 20, 2024, Defendant Cyndi Finkle filed a motion to quash the deposition subpoenas
for John Luna and Janet Lowder, who she had designated as expert witnesses.
On
June 28, 2024, Defendant filed a Notice of Cancellation of Exchange of Expert Witness
Information.
On
July 30, 2024, Plaintiff withdrew the subpoenas.
The
motion to quash is therefore DENIED AS MOOT.
MOTION
TO SET ASIDE DEFAULT
On
June 29, 2021, Plaintiff Larchmont Place LLC filed this action against Defendant
Circle W Productions Inc. and others.  (Defendant
was named via a Doe amendment on March 28, 2023.)  On May 23, 2024, the Court entered default against
Defendant.
On
July 15, 2024, Defendant filed a motion to set aside default.  No oppositions were filed.
The Court may set aside a default or default judgment
upon a motion and affidavit attesting that the lack of actual notice in time to
defend the action was not caused by the party’s avoidance of service or inexcusable
neglect.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5.)  “If the court has acquired jurisdiction, i.e.,
summons has been served, but service of summons has not resulted in actual notice
to a defendant, although the defendant has acquired actual knowledge of the action
from another source, this does not preclude a defendant from seeking relief under
section 473.5.”  (Olvera v. Olvera
(1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 32, 40.)
Defendant’s
sole owner/officer/director declares that he never received the summons and complaint.  (Williams Decl. ¶ 3.)  The Proof of Service shows substituted service
at a private mailbox business.  (Williams
Decl. ¶ 6.)  Williams does not know anyone
matching the description of the person served, and he never received a copy of the
documents.  (Williams Decl. ¶¶ 7-8.)  He first learned of this case on April 21, 2024,
when his ex-wife forwarded an email chain from her counsel.  (Williams Decl. ¶ 2 & Ex. A.)  He retained counsel for Defendant on the same
day.  (Williams Decl. ¶ 4.)
Defendant’s
evidence shows that it did not have actual notice of this action before April 21,
2024, and it acted diligently thereafter. 
No party opposed this motion.
The
Motion to Set Aside/Vacate Default is GRANTED. 
The May 23, 2024 entry of default against Circle W Productions Inc. is VACATED.
Defendant
is ordered to file its responsive pleading within 10 days.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
