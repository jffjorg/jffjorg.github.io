  CASE NO.: 24STCV07098
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT’S MOTION
  TO QUASH SERVICE OF SUMMONS
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
August 13, 2024



 
On March 21, 2024, Plaintiff Arsen Manson filed this action
against Defendants State of California and Laura Simpton.
On June 27, 2024, Laura Simpton filed
a motion to quash service of summons.  Plaintiff
did not file any opposition.
Defendant’s request for judicial notice
is denied as unnecessary.

A
defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time to plead or within any further
time that the court may for good cause allow, may serve and file a notice of motion
and motion to quash service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of
the court over him or her.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 418.10, subd. (a)(1).)  “When a defendant
challenges the court’s personal jurisdiction on the ground of improper service of
process ‘the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the existence of jurisdiction by
proving, inter alia, the facts requisite to an effective service.’”  (Summers v. McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th
403, 413, fn. omitted.)
The
only Proof of Service filed by Plaintiff states that a Declaration of Due Diligence
was personally served at Department 48 at the Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
Plaintiff
filed a Declaration of Due Diligence on June 4, 2024, which states that on May 3,
2024, he served Defendant with the summons and complaint through Certified Mail
with signature at PO Box 350, Sacramento, CA 95812-0350.  Plaintiff served the same documents in the same
manner again on May 28, 2024.
A
defendant may be served with the summons and complaint by mail with two copies of
a notice and acknowledgment of receipt and a return envelope, postage prepaid, addressed
to the sender.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.30.)  Plaintiff’s Declaration of Due Diligence does
not show service of a notice and acknowledgment of receipt.  Although Plaintiff declares that the Certified
Mail was “received under Signature,” “[a] postal service return receipt does not
suffice as a substitute for an executed acknowledgement of receipt of summons.”  (Tandy Corp. v. Superior Court (1981) 117
Cal.App.3d 911, 913.)
Additionally,
a summons must be served by someone who is not a party to the action.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 414.10.)  The prohibition on service of a summons by the
opposing party is strictly enforced.  (Braugh
v. Dow (2023) 93 Cal.App.5th 76, 89.) 
“When a party has served notice on the opposing party, the court lacks personal
jurisdiction over the defendant.”  (Caldwell
v. Coppola (1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 859, 865.) 
The Declaration of Due Diligence states that Plaintiff mailed the summons,
and it is signed by Plaintiff.
Plaintiff
did not file an opposition, so he has not proven the facts requisite to an effective
service.  The Court therefore concludes that
Defendant was not properly served.
CONCLUSION
The
Motion to Quash Service of Summons is GRANTED.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
