[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING AMENDED PETITION
  TO APPROVE MINOR’S COMPROMISE
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
August 13, 2024



 
Claimant
C.R., a minor, by and through his guardian ad litem, Mayra N. Rodriguez, has agreed
to settle his claims against Defendants Los Angeles Unified School District, Luis
Rodriguez-Cazares, and Karen Fattal in exchange for $139,500.00.  Of this amount, $726.47 is allocated for a Medi-Cal
lien, $41,850.00 is allocated for attorney fees, and $27,351.68 is allocated for
costs and expenses, leaving a balance of $69,571.85 for Claimant.  If approved, the funds will be deposited into
a blocked account, subject to withdrawal only upon authorization of the court.
Court
approval is required for all settlements of a minor’s claim.  (Probate Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; Code
Civ. Proc. § 372.)  The Court has reviewed
the proposed settlement and finds that it is fair and reasonable.  The Court also finds that the attorney fees, which
are 30% of the funds, are fair and reasonable.
Accordingly,
the Amended Petition to Approve Minor’s Compromise is GRANTED.  The Court sets an Order to Show Cause Re: Proof
of Deposit Into Blocked Account for October 14, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.  (California Rules of Court, rule 7.953(a).)  If acknowledgements of receipt by the financial
institution are filed before that date, no appearance will be required.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
