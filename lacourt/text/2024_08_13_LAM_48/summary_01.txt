And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling continues the hearing on the motion to tax costs until November 14, 2024. The ruling requires the defendants to file an amended memorandum of costs no later than September 13, 2024, and the plaintiff to file an amended motion to tax costs. The defendants had filed multiple memoranda of costs, which caused confusion about the amount of costs claimed. The judge is ordering the defendants to file a single amended memorandum of costs, and each defendant to file its own separate memorandum of costs for only its share of costs. The hearing scheduled for August 27, 2024 is taken off calendar.
