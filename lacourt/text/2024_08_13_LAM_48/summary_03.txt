Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion to quash service of summons filed by the defendant, Laura Simpton, is granted. The plaintiff, Arsen Manson, failed to prove the facts necessary to show effective service of the summons and complaint. The plaintiff served the defendant by mail with signature at PO Box 350, Sacramento, CA, but did not provide a notice and acknowledgment of receipt, as required by law. Additionally, the plaintiff served the summons and complaint himself, which is not allowed. As a result, the judge concludes that the defendant was not properly served and grants the motion to quash service of summons.
