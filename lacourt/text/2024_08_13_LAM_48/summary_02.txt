And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively granted the amended petition to approve the minor's compromise, which allows the claimant, C.R., to settle his claims against the defendants, Los Angeles Unified School District, Luis Rodriguez-Cazares, and Karen Fattal, in exchange for $139,500.00. The court finds that the proposed settlement is fair and reasonable, and that the attorney fees, which are 30% of the funds, are also fair and reasonable. The court has set an order to show cause regarding proof of deposit into a blocked account for October 14, 2024, and has ordered the defendants to give notice to all parties involved. If all parties submit to the tentative ruling, no appearances before the court are required unless a companion hearing is also on calendar.
