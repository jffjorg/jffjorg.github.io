[TENTATIVE] ORDER CONTINUING MOTION TO TAX
  COSTS 
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
August 13, 2024



 
On June 7, 2024, the Court entered
judgment in favor of Defendants Jamison Services Inc., Central Plaza LLC, and Jamison
Realty Advisors LLC, and against Plaintiff Hyung Koo.
On
June 25, 2024, Jamison Services Inc. and Central Plaza LLC filed a memorandum of
costs for $57,376.83 in costs.
On
July 1, 2024, Jamison Services Inc., Central Plaza LLC, and Jamison Realty Advisors
LLC filed a one-page memorandum of costs for $32,726.79 in costs.  On July 2, 2024, they filed a multi-page memorandum
of costs for the same amount.  Neither of
these are identified as amended versions.
On
July 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to tax the memorandum of costs filed by
Jamison Services, Inc. and Central Plaza LLC. 
Plaintiff challenges $45,947.06 in deposition costs, $1,866.45 in fees for
electronic filing or service, and $6,255.11 in other costs.
On
July 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to tax the memorandum of costs filed by
Jamison Realty Advisors, LLC, and Central Plaza LLC.  Plaintiff challenges $2,666.67 in mediation costs.
A
prevailing party who claims costs must file a memorandum of costs—but not multiple
memoranda of costs.  (See California Rules
of Court, rule 3.1700(a).)  Defendants’ Opposition
does not acknowledge their piecemeal claims for costs.  Multiple memoranda of costs cause confusion about
the amount of costs claimed, including whether they are additional or duplicate
claims.
Defendants
are ORDERED to file an amended memorandum of costs no later than September 13, 2024.  If the three Defendants claim different allocations
of the costs, then each Defendant shall file its own separate memorandum of costs
for only its share of costs.
The
Hearing on Motion to Tax Costs is CONTINUED to November 14, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.
Plaintiff
shall file an amended motion to tax costs, Defendants shall file an amended opposition,
and Plaintiff shall file a reply based on statutory notice before the continued
hearing date.
The
Hearing on Motion to Tax Costs scheduled for August 27, 2024 is taken off calendar.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
