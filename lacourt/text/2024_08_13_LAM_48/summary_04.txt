And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has tentatively ruled that the Motion to Quash Service of Summons filed by the State of California, et al. is GRANTED. The Court finds that the Plaintiff, Arsen Manson, did not properly serve the Defendant with the summons and complaint. The Plaintiff's Declaration of Due Diligence states that the Defendant was served through Certified Mail, but it does not show service of a notice and acknowledgment of receipt. Additionally, the Plaintiff's Declaration of Due Diligence is signed by the Plaintiff, who is a party to the action, and therefore does not meet the requirements for proper service. The Court concludes that the Defendant was not properly served, and the Motion to Quash Service of Summons is therefore granted.
