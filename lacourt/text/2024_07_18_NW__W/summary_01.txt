And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Albert W. Boyajian on a demurrer to a complaint filed by Albert Boyajian against various defendants. The case involves a dispute over a sale of a bakery and the subsequent acquisition of additional companies by the parent entity. The plaintiff alleges that the lender has not given him information on the companies and has not called a meeting of the board.

The defendants demurred to the complaint on several grounds, including that California law does not allow double derivative suits, that the demand requirement has not been met, and that the complaint fails to join an indispensable party. The court overruled the demurrer on the grounds that California law does allow double derivative suits and that the demand requirement has been met. The court also found that the plaintiff has adequately pleaded his claims and that the defendants have failed to show that the complaint is legally insufficient.

The court also addressed the issue of whether the plaintiff must make a demand on the Stapleton Group, an assignee of Holdings LLC's assets. The court concluded that the plaintiff did not need to make a demand on Stapleton because such a demand would have been futile. The court also found that the plaintiff has adequately pleaded his claims against the Firmament defendants and that the defendants have failed to show that the complaint is legally insufficient.
