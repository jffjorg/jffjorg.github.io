significant_statements:
  - Public entities are not liable for injuries unless a statute declares them liable.
  - A public entity is liable for a dangerous condition of its property if the plaintiff establishes that the property was in a dangerous condition at the time of the injury, that the injury was proximately caused by the dangerous condition, and that the dangerous condition created a reasonably foreseeable risk of the kind of injury which was incurred.
  - A lack of human supervision and protection is not a deficiency in the physical characteristic of public property capable of being a “dangerous condition,” as required to support a public entity’s liability as a property owner for injuries sustained on the property.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendant, Centinela Valley Union High School District, in a case brought by plaintiff, Joseph Escobar. The defendant is arguing that the plaintiff's complaint fails to state a cause of action for negligence and breach of mandatory duties.

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the plaintiff's negligence causes of action, finding that the complaint lacks particularity and fails to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action. The judge has also sustained the demurrer to the plaintiff's cause of action for breach of mandatory duties, finding that the complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action.

The judge has also sustained the demurrer to the plaintiff's cause of action for a dangerous condition of public property, finding that the complaint lacks particularity and fails to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action.

The motion to strike is mooted as it is based on the causes of action that have been sustained in the demurrer.

The judge's decision is based on California law and relevant court cases. The judge has applied the relevant legal standards and has concluded that the plaintiff's complaints fail to state a cause of action.
