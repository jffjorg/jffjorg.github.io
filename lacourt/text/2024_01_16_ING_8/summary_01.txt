And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to continue the defendant's demurrer and motion to strike due to the unexcused filing of an oversized brief. The defendant's demurrer is seventeen pages long, exceeding the 15-page limit set by California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1113(d). The judge notes that the defendant did not obtain permission to file a longer memorandum, as required by Rule 3.1113(e). The majority of the motion to strike arguments hinge on the arguments made in the demurrer, so the judge is continuing the motion to strike as well. The judge will discuss at the hearing whether the defendant plans to re-file a code-compliant motion.
