**Summary:** The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to compel defendant FCA US LLC to respond to discovery requests, including requests for production of documents, special interrogatories, requests for admission, and form interrogatories. The ruling also grants the request for sanctions in the amount of $2,500 against defense counsel, payable within 20 days. The court finds that the defendant's belated responses were not sufficient to moot the motion, and that defense counsel's handling of the case was not justified. The ruling also notes that the defendant's failure to provide timely responses was due to their own mistake and excusable neglect.
