And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion filed by Plaintiff's counsel, Dennis P. Block & Associates, to be relieved as attorney of record for Plaintiff, Mary Elizabeth Hall. This decision is based on the fact that the attorney-client relationship between the plaintiff and the attorneys has broken down, making it impossible for the attorneys to effectively prosecute the case. The judge finds that withdrawal of the attorney of record would not cause an injustice or undue delay in the proceedings. The judge also notes that the motion was properly filed and served, and that the attorney has complied with all procedural requirements. The judge orders that the motion be granted, and that the signed order be served on the client and all parties that have appeared in the case. The order will not be effective until proof of service has been filed with the court.
