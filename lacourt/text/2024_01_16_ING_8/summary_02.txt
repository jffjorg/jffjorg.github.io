Summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a case involving a plaintiff, Vivianne Jean Coe, who purchased a used vehicle from Subaru Pacific with a balance remaining on the manufacturer's express warranty. The defendant, Subaru of America, Inc. and Subaru Pacific, filed a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication, arguing that the Song-Beverly Act does not apply to sales of used vehicles with a balance remaining on the manufacturer's express warranty. The court finds that the defendant has not met its moving burden as to the plaintiff's first cause of action for breach of express warranty under the Song-Beverly Act and declines to rely on Rodriguez v. FCA US, LLC (2022) 77 Cal.App.5th 209. The court also cannot determine whether SOA stepped into the role of a retailer, opening it up to implied warranty liability, due to the lack of attachment for Exhibit B to the declaration of James Hartzberg.
