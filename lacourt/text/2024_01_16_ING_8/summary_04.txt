And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Tesla's Motion to Compel Arbitration. The court finds that the arbitration agreement in the Motor Vehicle Purchase Agreement (MVPA) is valid and enforceable. The court disagrees with the plaintiff's arguments that the arbitration agreement is unconscionable and/or revocable. The court finds that the procedural unconscionability is low and that the substantive unconscionability is not present. The court orders that the case be arbitrated by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules.
