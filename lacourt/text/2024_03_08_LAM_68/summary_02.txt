And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions for summary judgment and summary adjudication. The case involves a dispute between Henghame Abaghi and State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company over a water supply line rupture that caused damage to Abaghi's home. State Farm denied Abaghi's insurance claim based on policy terms, and Abaghi is seeking damages for breach of contract and bad faith.

The judge has denied the motion for summary judgment on the breach of contract and bad faith claims, finding that there are triable issues of material fact. The dispute between the experts on the cause of the damage and the interpretation of the policy terms creates a genuine issue for trial.

The judge has granted the motion for summary adjudication on the punitive damages claim, finding that the circumstances do not meet the heightened factual standard required for punitive damages.

The motion to quash is scheduled for March 20, 2024, and the trial remains set for May 28, 2024.
