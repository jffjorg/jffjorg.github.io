[Tentative] Order Denying Petition for Writ of Mandate
 
 
 
            Petitioner
Qian Cheng (“Petitioner”), on behalf of her daughter Yuan Yuan Leo
(“Recipient”), petitions for a writ of administrative mandate directing
Respondent Kim Johnson, Director of the California Department of Social
Services (“Respondent”), to set aside an administrative decision denying
Petitioner’s claim for protective supervision and other services for Recipient
under the In-Home Supportive Services (“IHSS”) program.  At the trial setting conference, the court
scheduled the petition for hearing on May 22, 2024, set a briefing schedule,
and ordered the administrative record to be lodged 15 days prior to the
hearing.  Petitioner gave notice of the
trial date and briefing schedule.  Nevertheless,
Petitioner has not filed an opening brief or lodged the administrative
record.  
 
Under Code of
Civil Procedure section 1094.5(b), the pertinent issues are whether the
respondent has proceeded without jurisdiction, whether there was a fair trial,
and whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion.  An abuse of discretion is established if the
agency has not proceeded in the manner required by law, the decision is not
supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by the
evidence.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1094.5(b).)  An agency is presumed to have regularly
performed its official duties.  (Evid.
Code § 664.)  The petitioner
seeking administrative mandamus has the burden of proof and must cite to the
administrative record to support its contentions.  (See Bixby v. Pierno (1971) 4 Cal.3d 130,
143; Steele v. Los Angeles County Civil Service Commission, (1958) 166 Cal.App
2d 129, 137; see also Alford v. Pierno (1972) 27
Cal.App.3d 682, 691 [“[T]he burden of proof falls upon the party attacking the
administrative decision to demonstrate wherein the proceedings were unfair, in
excess of jurisdiction or showed prejudicial abuse of discretion.”].)  “[A] trial court must afford a
strong presumption of correctness concerning the administrative findings.” (See
Fukuda v. City of Angels (1999) 20
Cal. 4th 805, 817.)   
 
A reviewing court
“will not act as counsel for either party … and will not assume the task of
initiating and prosecuting a search of the record for any purpose of
discovering errors not pointed out in the briefs.” (Fox v. Erickson (1950) 99 Cal.App.2d 740, 742.)  A memorandum of points and authorities is
required for a noticed mandamus motion. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 1094; Cal.
Rules of Court rule 3.1113(a).)   The
absence of a memorandum is an admission that the motion is not meritorious and
may be denied.  (Cal. Rules of Court rule
3.1113(a).)  “The memorandum must contain
a statement of facts, a concise statement of the law, evidence and arguments
relied on, and a discussion of the statutes, cases, and textbooks cited in
support of the position advanced.”  (Cal.
Rules of Court rule 3.1113(b); Quantum Cooking Concepts, Inc. v. LV
Associates, Inc. (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 927, 934 [Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1113 “rests on a policy-based allocation of resources, preventing the trial
court from being cast as a tacit advocate for the moving party's theories”].)  
 
“In a section
1094.5 proceeding, it is the responsibility of the petitioner to produce a
sufficient record of the administrative proceedings; ‘... otherwise the
presumption of regularity will prevail, since the burden falls on the
petitioner attacking the administrative decision to demonstrate to the trial
court where the administrative proceedings were unfair, were in excess of
jurisdiction, or showed’ prejudicial abuse of discretion.”  (Elizabeth
D. v. Zolin (1993) 21 Cal.App.4th 347, 354, citations omitted; see also Eureka Citizens for Responsible Government
v. City of Eureka (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 357, 366 [“Failure to provide an
adequate record concerning an issue challenged on appeal requires that the
issue be resolved against the appellants.”])
 
In the instant
case, Petitioner has not filed an opening brief or lodged the administrative
record.  Accordingly, Petitioner has not
met her burden of proof under section 1094.5 to show a prejudicial abuse of discretion,
a denial of a fair trial, or other reversible error in the administrative decision.  Based upon the foregoing, the petition for
writ of mandate is denied.  The court’s
clerk shall provide notice.     
 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
