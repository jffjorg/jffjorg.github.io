And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Stephen I. Goorvitch, has issued a tentative ruling denying Petitioner Qian Cheng's petition for a writ of mandate. Petitioner seeks to set aside an administrative decision denying her claim for protective supervision and services under the In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) program for her daughter, Yuan Yuan Leo. The Judge finds that Petitioner has not met her burden of proof under section 1094.5 to show a prejudicial abuse of discretion, denial of a fair trial, or other reversible error in the administrative decision. The Judge notes that Petitioner has not filed an opening brief or lodged the administrative record, and accordingly, the petition is denied.
