And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion from the defendant, Bin Zhang, to set aside a default judgment entered against him in August 2022. The defendant claims that he did not receive actual notice of the lawsuit until March 2024, when he received an abstract of judgment registered with the Office of the Clerk of the County of Los Angeles. The judge finds that the motion is timely, as it was filed within two years of the entry of default judgment.

The judge also finds that the defendant has shown that he did not receive actual notice of the lawsuit in time to defend it. The only evidence presented by the plaintiff is the defendant's own declaration stating that he received notice of the lawsuit, which the judge finds credible.

Finally, the judge finds that the plaintiff has failed to show that the defendant is associated with De Ozark, the company where he was allegedly served via substitute service. The judge grants the defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment and orders the plaintiff to file an answer within 20 days.
