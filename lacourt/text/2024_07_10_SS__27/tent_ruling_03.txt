MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT¿AND SUMMARY ADJUDICATION 
Hearing Date: 7/10/24 
CASE NO./NAME: 21STCV40190 BATOOL SALEKI vs
CITY OF LOS ANGELES 
Moving Party: Defendant City of Los Angeles
Responding Party: Plaintiff¿ 
Notice: Sufficient¿ 
Ruling: MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT IS GRANTED
 
Background
 
On March 21, 2021, Plaintiff allegedly tripped
and fell over a 1-inch sidewalk displacement located on a public sidewalk on
Beverly Glen Blvd in the City of Los Angeles. Plaintiff sued the City for
premises liability and general negligence.  The City now moves for summary judgment because
(1) a public entity can only be sued as authorized by statute, not under a
general negligence theory, and (2) the defect at issue was trivial, consisting
of a 1-inch displacement and no aggravating factors.
 
Legal Standard
 
In reviewing a motion for summary judgment,
courts must apply a three-step analysis: “(1) identify the issues framed by the
pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has negated the opponent’s
claims; and (3) determine whether the opposition has demonstrated the existence
of a triable, material factual issue.”¿(Hinesley
v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.)
  
“[T]he initial burden is always on the moving
party to make a prima facia showing that there are no triable issues of
material fact.”¿(Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.)¿A
defendant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication “has met his or
her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if the party has
shown that one or more elements of the cause of action . . . cannot be
established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of action.”¿(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).)¿If the moving party fails to carry its burden, the inquiry is over,
and the motion must be denied. (See Id.; see also Consumer Cause,
Inc. v. SmileCare (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 454, 468.)¿Even if the moving party does carry its burden, the non-moving
party will still defeat the motion by presenting evidence of a triable issue of
material fact. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826,
849-50.)
 
To meet this burden of showing a cause of
action cannot be established, a defendant must show not only “that the
plaintiff does not possess needed evidence” but also that “the plaintiff
cannot reasonably obtain needed evidence.”¿(Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 854.)¿It is insufficient for the defendant to merely point out the
absence of evidence.¿(Gaggero
v. Yura (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 884, 891.)¿The defendant “must also produce evidence that the plaintiff cannot
reasonably obtain evidence to support his or her claim.”¿(Ibid.)¿The
supporting evidence can be in the form of affidavits, declarations, admissions,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and matters of which judicial notice
may be taken.¿(Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at
p. 855.)
 
“Once the defendant … has met that burden, the
burden shifts to the plaintiff … to show that a triable issue of one or more
material facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) The plaintiff may not merely rely on
allegations or denials of its pleadings to show that a triable issue of
material fact exists, but instead, “shall set forth the specific facts showing
that a triable issue of material fact exists as to the cause of action.”¿(Ibid.)¿“If the
plaintiff cannot do so, summary judgment should be granted.”¿(Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159
Cal.App.4th 463, 467.)
 
The court
must “liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary
judgment and resolve all doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that
party,” including “all inferences reasonably drawn therefrom.” (Yanowitz
v. L’Oreal USA, Inc. (2005) 36 Cal.4th 1028, 1037;
Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp. 844-45.) “On a summary judgment
motion, the court must therefore consider what inferences favoring the opposing
party a factfinder could reasonably draw from the evidence. While viewing
the evidence in this manner, the court must bear in mind that its primary
function is to identify issues rather than to determine issues. [Citation.] Only when the
inferences are indisputable may the court decide the issues as a matter of law.  If the
evidence is in conflict, the factual issues must be resolved by trial.” (Binder v.
Aetna Life Ins. Co. (1999) 75
Cal.App.4th 832, 839.) Further, “the
trial court may not weigh the evidence in the manner of a factfinder to
determine whose version is more likely true. [Citation.] Nor may the
trial court grant summary judgment based on the court’s
evaluation of credibility. [Citation.]” (Id. at p.
840; see also Weiss v. People ex rel. Department
of Transportation (2020) 9 Cal.5th 840, 864
[“Courts deciding motions for summary judgment or summary adjudication may not
weigh the evidence but must instead view it in the light most favorable to the
opposing party and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that party”].)
Judicial Notice and Evidentiary Ruling 
The Court
overrules Plaintiff’s Objection No 2. The Parties did not make any other objections
to evidence that were material to the Court’s ruling. (CCP § 437c(q).)
General Negligence
 
A public entity in
California is not liable for any injury, whether it arises out of act or
omission of the public entity or a public employee or any other person, except
as provided by statute. (Branch v. State of California Ex Rel. Dept. of
Transportation (1984)159 Cal. App. 3d 340, 343; Cal Gov. Code § 815(a).)
The sole statutory basis for imposing premise liability on public entities as
property owners is Government Code section 835. (See Zelig v. County
of Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.4th 1112, 1131- 32.) In
the opposition, Plaintiff acknowledges that “first cause of action should be
dismissed as the City cannot be held liable for general negligence.”
(Opposition at pg. 6.) Thus, Defendant’s summary judgment against Plaintiff’s
general negligence cause of action against the City is GRANTED.
Premises Liability
 
The Trivial Defect Doctrine
 
“Property owners are required to maintain land
in their possession and control in a reasonably safe condition and to use due
care to eliminate dangerous conditions on their property.  But a property
owner is not liable for damages caused by a minor, trivial, or insignificant
defect on its property.  The so-called ‘trivial defect doctrine’
recognizes that persons who maintain walkways, whether public or private, are
not required to maintain them in an absolutely perfect condition.  The duty
of care imposed on a property owner, even one with actual notice, does not
require the repair of minor defects.”  (Fajardo v. Dailey (2022) 85
Cal.App.5th 221, 226 [cleaned up].)  
 
“In limited circumstances a court may
determine a walkway defect is trivial as a matter of law.  Where
reasonable minds can reach only one conclusion—that there was no substantial
risk of injury—the issue is a question of law, properly resolved by way of
summary judgment.  But where sufficient evidence has been presented so
that reasonable minds may differ as to whether the defect is dangerous, summary
judgment is inappropriate.”  (Id. at p. 226.)   
   
California Courts have developed two
substantially similar tests to determine whether a sidewalk defect is trivial,
i.e., not dangerous, as a matter of law.  In Stathoulis v. City of
Montebello (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 559, 567-68, the Court of Appeal set out
a two part test. “First, the court reviews evidence regarding the type and size
of the defect.  If that preliminary analysis reveals a trivial defect, the
court considers evidence of any additional factors such as the weather,
lighting and visibility conditions at the time of the accident, the existence
of debris or obstructions, and plaintiff’s knowledge of the area.  If
these additional factors do not indicate the defect was sufficiently dangerous
to a reasonably careful person, the court should deem the defect trivial as a
matter of law ....” (See also Nunez v. City of Redondo Beach (2022) 81
Cal.App.5th 749, 758 [adopting two-step framework]; Huckey v. City of
Temecula (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 1092, 1105 [same].)
 
More recently, in Stack v. City of
Lemoore (2023) 91 Cal.App.5th 102, 110, the Court of Appeal read Government
Code section 830.2 to require a more “holistic” approach, stating, “[a]lthough
we agree with the premise that the size of the defect is the primary
determinant of triviality, as discussed below, we modify the prevailing
two-step framework into a holistic, multi-factor analysis.”  The Court
will follow Stack’s holistic approach, although the result would be the
same under either test.
 
1.  Size of the Defect
 
“We begin with the most important factor: the defect’s size.” (Stack,
91 Cal.App.5th at p. 110 [cleaned up].)  “Sidewalk elevations ranging
from three-quarters of an inch to one and one-half inches have generally been
held trivial as a matter of law.” (Huckey, supra, 37 Cal.App.5th at p.
1107; see Stathoulis, supra, 164 Cal.App.4th at p. 568 [“Several
decisions have found height differentials of up to one and one-half inches
trivial as a matter of law.”])  A more “accurate encapsulation” of the
law, according to Stack, is that “when the size of the depression begins
to stretch beyond one inch the courts have been reluctant to find that
the defect is not dangerous as a matter of law, i.e., that it is minor or
trivial.”  (Stack, supra, 91 Cal.App.5th at p. 112.)  “That
said, there is no firmly fixed arbitrary measurement in inches below which a
defect is trivial as a matter of law and above which it becomes a question of
fact whether or not the defect is dangerous.  This is because a court
should not rely solely upon the size of the defect ... although the
defect’s size ‘may be one of the most relevant factors’ to the court’s
decision.”  (Id. at pp. 112–113 [cleaned up].)
 
2.  Aggravating Factors
 
The Court next considers additional
factors. “Beyond size, additional factors courts typically consider in
assessing a sidewalk condition’s triviality as a matter of law are: the nature
and quality of the defect (including whether it has jagged breaks or cracks);
whether anything was obstructing or concealing the defect (for instance, an
object, debris, or other substance); the lighting and weather conditions at the
time of the incident; whether the defect has caused other accidents; and
plaintiff's familiarity with the area.” (Stack, supra, 91
Cal.App.5th at p. 115.)
 
Defendant’s Burden
Defendant has met its
initial burden. The displacement in question was measured at 1 inch in height
(Luevano Decl., ¶¶ 7-8). The incident occurred on March 21, 2021, around 6:30
p.m. Plaintiff fell when she was taking a walk with her daughter on Beverly
Glen Blvd near her daughter's apartment. At the time of the incident, it was
light outside. The weather was sunny. (Plaintiff’s Deposition, 14:7-11; 59:6-8;
62:10-15). Plaintiff had previously walked on the sidewalk at issue
approximately 10 to 50 times. It is located just a few steps from her daughter's
apartment (Plaintiff’s Deposition, 14:12-15:2; 26:24-27:2). Plaintiff is not
aware of anybody else who had tripped and fallen at the same location where she
fell (Plaintiff’s Deposition, 64:19-21). A search of City records showed that
no claims for personal injury with an incident date range of March 21, 2011,
through March 21, 2021, had been presented to the City of Los Angeles due to
any dangerous condition located at or near 2265 S. Beverly Glen Blvd, other
than the claim presented by Plaintiff Batool Saleki. (Brian Sam Decl. ¶6.)
Defendant has met its
burden in showing that the displacement was 1 inch in height without the
presence of any significant aggravating factors.
Triable issue of fact
Plaintiff failed to
raise a triable issue of fact. The parties do not dispute that the displacement
is 1 inch in height, Plaintiff has previously walked on the same street between
10-50 times (UMF 7), and the weather at the time of the incident was sunny and
without rain (UMF 6).
Plaintiff attempted to
argue that the area was shaded and covered with debris, but the Court's
examination of the photographs taken near the time of the incident showed clear
visibility and minimal debris. Any debris present was on the grass or edge of the
sidewalk, not near the displacement, and did not obscure visibility of the
displacement (Exhibit C, at pp. 33-34, and Exhibits 4, 5, 6, and 9).
Plaintiff introduced
evidence of a prior incident at the location, but the incident was relating to a
sign and not any trip and fall (F. Gary Gsell Decl., ¶ 16). Additionally,
Plaintiff did not present any evidence showing prior trip and fall incidents at
the location in question.
Plaintiff's counsel
argued that Plaintiff was unlikely to notice the displacement because Beverly
Glen Blvd is a major street with high-speed vehicles, people riding sccoters,
rising crime rates, homelessness, and her age made her a susceptible target for
crimes. In Stack v. City of Lemoore (2023) 91 Cal.App.5th 102, 115, the
Court outlined the aggravating factors it considers in assessing the triviality
of a defect and it does not include factors such as rising crime rates or
homelessness.  (The Court recognizes that
homelessness could play a role if an unhoused person or encampment obstructed
the sidewalk, but there is no evidence of that here.)  Even if those factors were considered, they
are simply speculative here – no evidence was presented to support the argument
that they played a role in Plaintiff’s trip and fall.
After examining all the
evidence, the Court finds the displacement in question to be trivial as a
matter of law. First, the 1-inch displacement is below the threshold where the
Court would hesitate to find it trivial. (Stack, supra, 91 Cal.App.5th
at p. 112). Courts routinely found height differentials of up to one
and one-half inches trivial as a matter of law. (See, e.g., Barrett v. City
of Claremont (1953) 41 Cal.2d 70, 74 [in the absence of aggravating
conditions, differential of less than half an inch deemed trivial]; Caloroso
v. Hathaway (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 922 927 [elevation difference of under
half an inch]; Fielder v. City of Glendale (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d
719, 724, fn. 4 [same]; Nicholson v. City of Los Angeles (1936) 5
Cal.2d 361, 367 [one and one-half inch elevation difference]; Whiting v.
City of National City (1937) 9 Cal.2d 163, 165-166 [ 69 P.2d 990]
[elevation difference of a maximum of three-fourths of an inch].)  
Second, there are no
significant aggravating factors present. Plaintiff presented no evidence of any
prior fall at the location in question. Plaintiff is knowledgeable of the area
and has walked the sidewalk at issue many times. There are no jagged edges or
potholes. The photographs show good lighting, sunny, clear weather, and minimal
debris, not covering the displacement itself.
Therefore, the Court
grants summary judgment.
