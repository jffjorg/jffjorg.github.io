Summary:
The Judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer to Macera's cause of action for equitable indemnity and contribution, and overrules the demurrer to the cause of action for declaratory relief. The Judge takes judicial notice of the Plaintiffs' discovery responses, which show only non-economic damages. The Defendant Hospital argues for immunity under Government Code 8659, but the Judge finds that the services provided did not exceed those already being rendered before the State of Emergency declaration. The Judge also determines that there is no joint legal obligation among the defendants for non-economic damages, and therefore, no indemnity or contribution is available.
