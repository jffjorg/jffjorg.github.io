The judge has granted the motion filed by Patricia A. Law, the attorney for Plaintiff Ashley Oelsen, to be relieved as counsel. The motion was unopposed and the judge found that the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship was proper grounds for withdrawal. The next hearing is scheduled for October 14, 2024, which the judge believes will be sufficient time for the Plaintiff to retain new counsel. The judge also noted that if the Plaintiff or new counsel needs additional time to prepare for trial, they can seek a continuance of the trial. The motion is granted effective upon service on the Plaintiff.
