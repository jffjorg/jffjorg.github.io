And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories and requests for production, and the requests for sanctions. The Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant failed to provide timely responses to the discovery requests, and that the Defendant's objections to the responses were waived. The Defendant argued that the responses were provided on time, and that the objections were not waived.

The Judge found that the Defendant provided proof of service showing that the initial discovery responses were mailed on June 15, 2023, and that the Defendant can choose any method of service permitted by statute, including service by mail. The Judge also found that the Defendant's verification of the discovery responses substantially complies with the requirements of CCP § 2015.5.

The Judge held that the Defendant's objections were timely, and that the lack of verification did not waive the objections. The Judge also found that the parties acted with substantial justification, and therefore denied the requests for sanctions. The Judge's tentative ruling is subject to further submission by the parties, and may be adopted as the order of the Court if no one appears to argue the motion.
