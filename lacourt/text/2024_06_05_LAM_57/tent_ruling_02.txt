 Case Number:  23STCV06384    Hearing Date:   June 5, 2024    Dept:  57 Demurrer
Defendant
Caesarstone LTD’s demurrer to the complaint of Plaintiff Willam Moz-Murcia is
overruled.
Causation
on Negligence Claim.   The allegations in Plaintiff’s complaint are
sufficient under Bockrath v. Aldrich Chemical Co. (1992) 21 Cal.4th 71,
to establish the element of causation as to Plaintiff’s claim for negligence.
Strict
Liability/Failure to Warn – Method of Exposure.  For purposes of Plaintiff’s claim that Caesarstone
is strictly liable to Plaintiff because it failed to warn Plaintiff about its
products, the complaint adequately alleges that the method by which Plaintiff
was exposed to the products. 
Strict
Liability/Design Defects.  For purposes of Plaintiff’s claim that Caesarstone
is strictly liable to Plaintiff because of design defects in Caesarstone’s products,
the complaint adequately alleges how the products were dangerously defective.
Fraudulent
concealment.  The allegations in Plaintiff’s complaint are
sufficient under Jones v. ConocoPhillips Co. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th
1187, to state a claim against Caesarstone for fraudulent concealment.
Motion
to Strike
Caesarstone’s
motion to strike is denied.
Punitive
Damages.  Plaintiff’s complaint contains sufficient
allegations on which a jury could find, for purposes of Plaintiff’s claim for
fraudulent concealment, that Caesarstone acted with malice, oppression, and
fraud and therefore is liable to Plaintiff for punitive damages. 
Other
Stone Products.  This Court has consistently taken the
position in denying the motions to strike of other Defendants in this case and
one other similar case before the Court that the allegations in Plaintiff’s
complaint about “other stone products to be identified in the course of
discovery” are sufficient to withstand a motion to strike.  The same is true with Caesarstone's motion to strike on this ground.
