Demurrer to Cross-Complaint 
 
The court has
considered the moving papers. No opposition or reply papers were filed.
The demurrer
filed by Cross-Defendant Luda Express, Inc. to the cross-complaint filed by PAF
Insurance Services, LLC is MOOT and is taken OFF-CALENDAR due to
the filing of a First Amended Cross-Complaint by PAF Insurance Services, Inc. 
 
Background
            This
is an action arising from lost or stolen sports trading cards. On June 24, 2022,
Plaintiff Artur Sargsyan, an individual doing business as Frontline Sports (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against Defendants TT Club Mutual Insurance Limited (“TTCMI”),
PAF Insurance Services, LLC (“PAF”), and DOES 1 through 20, inclusive, alleging
causes of action for: (1) breach of contract, (2) breach of the implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing, (3) reformation, (4) professional negligence,
(5) negligent misrepresentation, (6) tort of another, and (7) violation of Business
and Professions Code section 17200. 
            On
September 2, 2022, Defendant TTCMI filed an answer to the complaint. 
            On
October 2, 2022, Defendant PAF filed an answer to the complaint. 
            On
October 27, 2022, Defendant TTCMI filed a cross-complaint against Defendant PAF,
Total Quality Logistics, Luda Express, Inc. (“Luda”), and Roes 1 through 20,
alleging causes of action for: (1) violation of the Carmack Amendment, (2)
equitable/comparative/implied indemnity, (3) contribution, and (4) declaratory
relief. 
            On
December 14, 2022, Defendant PAF filed a cross-complaint against Defendant TTCMI,
Luda, and Total Quality Logistics alleging causes of action for: (1) equitable
indemnity, (2) apportionment of fault/contribution, and (3) declaratory relief.

            On
March 13, 2023, Luda filed and served the instant demurrer to the cross-complaint
filed by Defendant PAF.  
            On
January 3, 2024, Defendant PAF filed and served a First Amended Cross-Complaint
(“FAXC”) against Defendant TTCMI and Luda alleging causes of action for: (1) violation
of the Carmack Amendment, (2) equitable indemnity, (3)
apportionment/contribution, and (4) declaratory relief. 
            On
January 5, 2024, pursuant to a court order, the Court continued the hearing on
Luda’s demurrer from January 17, 2024 to March 1, 2024. 
            The
demurrer is unopposed. Any opposition to the demurrer was required to have been
filed and served at least nine court days prior to the hearing. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) 
 
Meet and Confer
            Before
filing a demurrer, the demurring party is required to meet and confer with the
party who filed the pleading sought to be demurred to, in person or telephonically
or by video conference, for the purposes of determining whether an agreement
can be reached through a filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).) 
An insufficient meet and confer process concerning a demurrer is not grounds to
sustain or overrule a demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(4).) 
            Counsel
for Luda, Frank X. Dipolito (“Dipolito”), declares that on March 1, 2023, he
spoke with counsel of record for Defendant PAF via telephone “of Luda’s intent
to file a demurrer to PAF’s Cross-Complaint on the grounds that each cause of
action alleged therein against Luda is preempted by Federal law. Mr. Scroggins
requested a written summary of [Luda’s] position.” (Dipolito Decl., ¶ 4.) On March 1, 2022,
Dipolito e-mailed a meet and confer letter to Luda’s counsel detailing the
factual and legal basis for Luda’s contemplated demurrer and requesting that
Defendant PAF dismiss its cross-complaint against Luda without prejudice. (Id.,
¶ 5.) To date, Dipolito declares that his office has not received a response to
the meet and confer letter. (Id., ¶ 6.) 
            The Court finds that the meet and
confer requirement has not been met as there was not a meet and confer discussion
in person, by telephone, or by video conference. However, the Court will assess
the demurrer. As will be explained below, the demurrer is moot due to the
filing of the FAXC. 
 
Legal
Standard
 “A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a
complaint as a matter of law.” (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183
Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.) “[T]he court gives the complaint a reasonable
interpretation, and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded.” (Ibid.)  In
testing the sufficiency of the complaint, the court must assume the truth of
(1) the properly pleaded factual allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably
inferred from those expressly pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone
and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. (SKF Farms v. Superior
Court (1984) 153 Cal. App. 3d 902, 905.) In assessing a demurrer, a court can
consider facts in exhibits attached to the complaint. (Picton v. Anderson
Union High School Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 726, 733.) Accordingly,
“[w]hether the plaintiff will be able to prove the pleaded facts is irrelevant
to ruling upon the demurrer.” (Stevens v. Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d
605, 609-10.) A general demurrer may be taken to a complaint where “[t]he
pleading does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 430.10(e).) Although courts construe pleadings liberally,
sufficient facts must be alleged to support the allegations plead to survive a
demurrer. (Rakestraw v. California Physicians' Serv. (2000) 81
Cal.App.4th 39, 43.) 
 
Discussion
            The
Filing of the FAXC
             “An amended [cross-complaint]
supersedes all prior [cross-complaints].” (Malear v. State (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th
213, 221, internal quotations omitted.) Where an amended cross-complaint is
filed “the original [cross-complaint] ceases to have any effect either as a
pleading or as a basis for judgment.” (Ibid.) “The amended [cross-complaint]
furnishes the sole basis for the cause of action, and the original [cross-complaint]
ceases to have any effect either as a pleading or as a basis for judgment.” (JKC3H8
v. Colton (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 468, 477.) “[T]here is but one [cross-complaint]
in a civil action . . . [and] the filing of an amended [cross-complaint] moots
a motion directed to a prior [cross-complaint].” (Ibid.) “A party may
amend its pleading once without leave of court . . . after a demurrer . . . is
filed but before the demurrer . . . is heard . . . if the amended pleading is
filed and served no later than the date for filing an opposition to the
demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 472.) 
Here, Luda’s
demurrer is directed at the initial cross-complaint filed by Defendant PAF. Defendant
PAF, however, has filed the FAXC which is now its operative cross-complaint.
The initial cross-complaint filed by Defendant PAF no longer has any effect as
a pleading. Thus, the demurrer filed by Luda is MOOT and is taken OFF-CALENDAR.
 
It is so
ordered.
