Summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Rolf M. Treu in the case of Artur Sargsyan, Plaintiff, vs. TT Club Mutual Insurance Limited, et al., Defendants. The case involves a dispute over lost or stolen sports trading cards and multiple parties have filed cross-complaints against each other. Luda Express, Inc. filed a demurrer to the cross-complaint filed by PAF Insurance Services, LLC, but the demurrer is now moot because PAF filed a First Amended Cross-Complaint, which supersedes the original cross-complaint. The Court finds that the demurrer is MOOT and is taken OFF-CALENDAR.
