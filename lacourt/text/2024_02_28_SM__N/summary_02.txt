And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Yeying Zhou vs. Hessam Arashfar. The Plaintiff, Yeying Zhou, had moved the Court to compel the Defendant, Hessam Arashfar, to provide further responses to her requests for production of documents. The Court has granted the motion as to Request No. 12, which seeks documents related to the Defendant's mobile phone bill and records, and denied it as moot as to Request No. 32, which sought a signed authorization for the Defendant's mobile carrier to provide the Plaintiff with the Defendant's cell phone records.

The Court has also awarded the Plaintiff monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,860, payable by the Defendant and his defense counsel, due to the Defendant's unreasonable refusal to provide responsive documents and delay in providing a necessary authorization. The Court has reduced the award to $1,860, which represents the time and effort spent reviewing responses, meeting and conferring, preparing a motion, and attending a hearing.
