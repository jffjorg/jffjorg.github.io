The plaintiff, Precision Products, Inc., has moved to set aside a dismissal of the action entered on October 24, 2023, claiming that the dismissal was the result of their counsel's mistake and neglect. The motion is unopposed. The court has found that the plaintiff is entitled to mandatory relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), as the motion was filed within six months of the dismissal and is accompanied by a sworn affidavit from counsel stating that the dismissal was caused by his mistake. Therefore, the court grants the motion and sets aside the dismissal.
