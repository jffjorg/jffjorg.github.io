 Case Number:  23STCV05954    Hearing Date:   April 22, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Enforce Settlement filed by Defendant Crystal
Villalobos.
 
Tentative
The motion is denied.
Background
 
This case arises out of an alleged motor vehicle accident on
July 25, 2021, near the intersection of Vernon Avenue and Vermont Avenue in Los
Angeles, California.
On March 17, 2023, Plaintiff Karina Elizabeth Hernandez
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint asserting causes of action for motor vehicle
negligence and general negligence against Defendants Lyft, Inc., Crystal
Villalobos, Juan C. Davalos, Guilda Asuncion Davalos, and Does 1 through 100.
The named defendants all filed answers during the period of
May through July 2023.
On May 3, 2023, Defendant Crystal Villalobos (“Defendant”) filed
a cross-complaint against Juan C. Davalos, Guilda Asuncion Davalos, and Roes 1
through 25.  The named cross-defendants
filed an answer to the cross-complaint on June 12, 2023.
On November 13,
2023, Defendant filed this motion to enforce settlement. Plaintiff filed an
opposition on December 11, 2023. Defendant filed a reply on December 15, 2023. 
 
By stipulation
of the parties, the hearing on this motion was continued to April 22.
 
Legal Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 provides: 
(a) If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a
writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If
requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to
enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement. 
(b) For purposes of this section, a
writing is signed by a party if it is signed by any of the following:
(1) The party.
(2) An attorney who represents the party.
(3) If the party is an insurer, an agent
who is authorized in writing by the insurer to sign on the insurer's behalf. 
Because of the summary nature of a proceeding to enforce a
settlement agreement under section 664.6, and because settlement of a lawsuit
implicates a substantial right of a litigant, strict compliance with the
statutory requirements is required.  (J.B.B.
Investment Partners, Ltd. v. Fair (2014)
232 Cal.App.4th 974, 985; Sully-Miller Contracting Co. v.
Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 30, 37.) 
Before the Legislature amended the statute effective as of January 1, 2021, “parties” under section 664.6 meant the litigants
themselves, not their attorneys.  (See Levy v. Superior Court
(1995) 10 Cal.4th 578, 586.)  In any event, however, for a settlement
agreement to be enforceable under section 664.6, all “parties” (as that term is
defined in the statute) must sign, including the party seeking to enforce the
agreement and the party against whom enforcement is sought.  (J.B.B.
Investment Partners, supra, 232 Cal.App.4th at p. 985.) 
If the settlement leaves material terms wanting, or confusing, the
settlement cannot be enforced through the section 664.6 summary
proceeding.  (Compare Terry v. Conlan (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 1445
[finding parties never agreed to the means that were material to the
settlement, including what role an independent manager was to play regarding
management of a trust property, and whether the trust should be qualified as a QTIP,
thereby indicating that there was no meeting of the minds as to the material
terms] with Osumi v. Sutton (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 1355 [holding trial
court’s decision to extend closing date for vendor’s agreement to repurchase
house did not create a material term and was within court’s power because the
closing date had passed by the time the motions came on for hearing and a new
closing date was necessary to grant the relief sought by both parties].)  Nonetheless, when the “parties intend that an agreement be
binding, the fact that a more formal agreement must be prepared and executed
does not alter the validity of the agreement.” (Blix St.
Records, Inc. v. Cassidy (2010)
191 CA4th 39, 48.)  
It is possible for parties to have an
enforceable settlement agreement that is not subject to the summary enforcement
proceedings of section 664.6 (including, for example, an
enforceable oral agreement to settle or an agreement that is signed by an
authorized representative who has the power to bind the party but is not listed
in subdivision (b) of the statute).  In
those circumstances, a party seeking to enforce the agreement must proceed
through other means, such as a separate civil action, an amendment to the
answer to add a new affirmative defense, and/or a motion for summary judgment,
rather than through the summary procedures of section 664.6.  (See generally Weddington Productions v.
Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793, 809 [“Section 664.6 was enacted to provide
a summary procedure for specifically enforcing a settlement contract without
the need for a new lawsuit.”].)
In ruling on a motion brought under Code of
Civil Procedure section 664.6, the court acts as a trier of fact.  The court may consider any admissible
evidence, including documents, declarations, and oral testimony.  (Kohn v. Jaymar-Ruby, Inc. (1994) 23
Cal.App.4th 1530, 1533; 3 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil
Procedure Before Trial (2023), ¶¶ 12:977-12:978.6.)
Discussion
On August 22, 2023, Defendant sent an email
to Plaintiff offering $15,000 to settle all claims against Defendant.  (Lawton Decl., Exh. B.)  Defendant served an offer to settle pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 998 in that same amount on August 24.  (Id., Exh. C.)
On September 13, 2023, at 4:34 pm, Plaintiff
responded with a lengthy letter.  (Id.,
Exhs. D-E.)  The opening sentence states,
in bold and underlined text, “This correspondence is a demand for $1,000,000.”  (Id., Exh. D, at unnumbered p. 1.)  In the second paragraph, the letter states, “this
demand is a demand to settle for the policy limits of your insured.”  (Ibid.)  After pages of contentions regarding liability
and the magnitude of Plaintiff’s injuries, Plaintiff again references policy
limits three more times.  (Id., at
unnumbered pp. 13, 15.)
At 4:54 pm on September 13, Defendant
responded with an email stating, right in the first sentence, the inconsistency
in Plaintiff’s demand letter: Defendant states, “Your demand references two
amounts.”  (Id., Exh. E.)  Defendant states that the “Flexdrive policy”
documents have been provided to Plaintiff and the applicable policy limit is
$15,000.  (Ibid.)  “There is no policy with a limit of
$1,000,000,” Defendant explains.  (Ibid.)  Defendant states, “[T]o the extent that this
is a policy limit demand for the $15,000 Flexdrive policy, it has already been
accepted.”  (Ibid.)
Four minutes later, at 4:48 pm, Plaintiff
responded by email: “The demand is for $1,000,000.  We will send an updated demand shortly [out]
of an abundance of caution.  You can
disregard the demand you just received.” 
(Wong Decl., Exh. 2.)
Then, at 5:03 pm, Plaintiff send a revised demand  (Id., Exhs. 2-3.)  The revised demand repeats the demand for
$1,000,000, without any reference to policy limits.  (Id., Exh. 3.)
The Court has reviewed all of the evidence and
argument presented by the parties.  On
this record, there is no settlement agreement that can be enforced under Code
of Civil Procedure section 664.6.  The
letter sent at 4:34 pm on September 13 was ambiguous, as Defendant noted
immediately, and is not a clear and unequivocal demand to settle at $15,000 (as
Defendant contends); indeed, given the history and prior communications between
counsel, the Court interprets the letter as stating a demand for $1,000,000.  If, as Defendant states, the only available
insurance policy has an applicable limit of $15,000, the most reasonable
reading of the references to “policy limits” in the letter is that they were a
typographical error or other mistake, as Defendant understood.  In any event, Plaintiff quickly resolved any
ambiguity as to the amount of the demand (within approximately 31 minutes).
To the extent Defendant is attempting to make
a hyper-technical argument about offer and acceptance, that argument does not
withstand scrutiny.  First, the initial
letter was ambiguous as to the critical term and thus cannot constitute a
legally sufficient offer and could not be “accepted” by Defendant.  Second, even if the letter could be construed
as a valid offer (which it was not), Defendant did not unambiguously accept it:
instead, Defendant simply observed that it had already accepted an offer to
settle at that amount  (presumably in
some other exchange of writings or oral discussion).  Before there was an unambiguous acceptance on
the letter sent on September 13, the offer was withdrawn (by email sent at 4:48
pm). 
The motion is denied. 
Conclusion
The Court DENIES the motion to enforce the
settlement agreement. 
Moving Party is
ORDERED to give notice.
