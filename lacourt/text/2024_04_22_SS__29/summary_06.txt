And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the motion to enforce the settlement agreement. The motion was filed by Defendant Crystal Villalobos to enforce a settlement agreement reached with Plaintiff Karina Elizabeth Hernandez. The settlement agreement was allegedly reached on September 13, 2023, when Plaintiff sent a letter to Defendant demanding $1,000,000 to settle all claims. Defendant responded by email, pointing out the inconsistency in the demand and stating that the applicable insurance policy limit was $15,000. The court found that the initial letter was ambiguous and lacked a clear and unequivocal demand to settle at $15,000. The court also found that the offer was not accepted by Defendant. Therefore, the court denied the motion to enforce the settlement agreement.
