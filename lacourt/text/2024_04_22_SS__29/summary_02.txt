And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court grants the City's motion in part. The Court orders that the truth of the matters specified in the City's Requests for Admission (Set One), Nos. 1-3 and 5-7, are deemed admitted as between the Plaintiff and the City. The Plaintiff's failure to provide a timely response to the Requests for Admission and failure to serve a verification of responses necessitated this motion. The Court denies the City's request for sanctions. The Court orders the moving party to give notice.
