And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the motion to compel the deposition of the plaintiff, Brandon Lara, as the case has been settled. The plaintiff filed a complaint against several defendants, including the El Monte Union High School District, alleging dangerous condition of public property and vicarious liability by public entity employees. The defendant filed a motion to compel the deposition of the plaintiff, but no opposition was filed. However, a notice of settlement was filed, which renders the motion to compel moot.
