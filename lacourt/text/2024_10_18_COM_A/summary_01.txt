And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying defendant Katrese Nickelson's motion to quash service of summons. The motion was filed in an unlawful detainer action, where Katrese is contesting her eviction from a residence owned by plaintiff Kamille Nickelson. The judge finds that although Katrese claims she did not receive service of summons on her, the proof of service indicates that she was personally served on September 7, 2024, and she also admits to receiving a copy of the summons and complaint. The judge concludes that the summons is valid and that the court has jurisdiction over Katrese. The judge orders Katrese to respond to the complaint within five days.
