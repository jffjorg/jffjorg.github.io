Piltan vs. Kaiser, et. al.,
Case No. 21STCV47149
 
Tentative Ruling re: 
Defendants’ Motion to Compel Arbitration
 
Defendants John J Kaiser and Kaiser
Legal Services, Inc. (collectively, Defendants) move to compel Plaintiff Babak
Piltan (Plaintiff) to binding arbitration and stay this action. The motion is
granted.
 
“On petition of a party to an
arbitration agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to
arbitrate a controversy and that a party thereto refuses to arbitrate such
controversy, the court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate
the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy
exists, unless it determines that: (a) The right to compel arbitration has been
waived by the petitioner; or (b) Grounds exist for the revocation of the
agreement.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1281.2,
subds. (a), (b).)
A proceeding to compel arbitration is
in essence a suit in equity to compel specific performance of a contract. (Freeman v. State Farm Mutual Auto Insurance
Co. (1975) 14 Cal.3d 473, 479.) Such enforcement may be sought by a party
to the arbitration agreement. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1280, subd. (e)(1).) 
            The petition to compel arbitration
functions as a motion and is to be heard in the manner of a motion, i.e., the
facts are to be proven by affidavit or declaration and documentary evidence
with oral testimony taken only in the court’s discretion. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§1290.2; Rosenthal v. Great Western Fin.
Securities Corp. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 394, 413–414.) The petition to compel
must set forth the provisions of the written agreement and the arbitration
clause verbatim, or such provisions must be attached and incorporated by
reference. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1330; see Condee v. Longwood Mgmt. Corp. (2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 215, 218 (Condee).)  
            Once petitioners allege that an
arbitration agreement exists, the burden shifts to respondents to prove the
falsity of the purported agreement, and no evidence or authentication is
required to find the arbitration agreement exists. (See Condee, supra, 88
Cal.App.4th at p. 219.) However, if the existence of the agreement is
challenged, “petitioner bears the burden of proving [the arbitration
agreement’s] existence by a preponderance of the evidence.” (Rosenthal v. Great Western Fin. Securities
Corp. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 394, 413; see also Espejo v. Southern California Permanente Medical Group (2016) 246
Cal.App.4th 1047, 1058–1060.)
 
In the Complaint, Plaintiff
alleges that he entered into a contract with Defendant John J Kaiser (Kaiser)
for Kaiser to represent Plaintiff in two LASC cases, 19STCV14650 and
19STCV14652. (Comp. ¶¶ 6-8.) Plaintiff asserts claims against Defendants including
for breach of contract, legal malpractice, and breach of fiduciary duty, based
on Kaiser’s alleged misconduct in connection with the two representations. 
 
Defendants present an
“Engagement Letter” from Kaiser Legal Services dated July 13, 2020 (the 52 Letter).
The Letter is addressed to “Babak Piltan on behalf of Mac Daddy Films, LLC,”
and states, “KAISER LEGAL SERVICES (‘Firm’) and MAC DADDY FILMS, LLC (‘Client’)
hereby agree that Firm will provide legal services to Client on the terms set
forth below. … The Legal Services provided under this engagement are all
litigation and trial activities in relation to representation of the Client
regarding the Los Angeles County court Case #19STCV14652.” (Kaiser Decl. ¶ 4,
Ex. 1.) The 52 Letter includes a section entitled “Arbitration,” which
provides, “[a]ny dispute, claim or controversy arising or relating to this
Agreement shall be determined by arbitration administered by JAMS pursuant to
its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. This includes: the
construction, application or performance of any obligations and services
including claims of malpractice…” (Id. [7].) The Letter lists the
“Client Name” as “MAC DADDY FILMS, LLC,” and the “Controlling Agent’s Name” as
“Babak Piltan.” (Id. [8].)
With their Reply,
Defendants present a second “Engagement Letter” concerning Defendants’
representation of Plaintiff, individually, in LASC case no. 19STCV14650 (the 50
Letter). (Kaiser Reply Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. B.) This second letter contains an
identical arbitration provision. (Id. [8].)  Because this agreement was submitted in
reply, Plaintiff was given the opportunity to file a sur-reply which the Court
has considered.
 
Plaintiff argues that he
cannot be compelled to arbitration under the 52 Letter because neither he nor
Kaiser are parties to the agreement. The Court finds that the 52 Letter’s
arbitration provision may be enforced against Plaintiff as a nonsignatory based
on equitable estoppel.
 
“In the arbitration
context, a party who has not signed a contract containing an arbitration
clause may nonetheless be compelled to arbitrate when he seeks enforcement of
other provisions of the same contract that benefit him. [Citation.] . . . [T]he equitable estoppel doctrine
applies when a party has signed an agreement to arbitrate but attempts to avoid
arbitration by suing nonsignatory defendants for claims that are ‘based on the
same facts and are inherently inseparable’ from arbitrable claims against signatory
defendants.” (Metalclad
Corp. v. Ventana Environmental Organizational Partnership (2003) 109
Cal.App.4th 1705, 1713.) “Courts
applying equitable estoppel against a signatory have ‘looked to the
relationships of persons, wrongs and issues, in particular whether the claims
that the nonsignatory sought to arbitrate were ‘intimately founded in and
intertwined with the underlying contract obligations.’ ” (Ibid.) “A nonsignatory plaintiff can
be compelled to arbitrate a claim even against a nonsignatory defendant, when
the claim is itself based on, or inextricably intertwined with, the contract
containing the arbitration clause.” (JSM Tuscany, LLC v. Superior Court
(2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 1222, 1241.)
            Here, Plaintiff’s
claims are based on and “inextricably intertwined with” the 52 Letter presented
by Defendants, as Plaintiff seeks to enforce the “contract for Defendant Kaiser
to
represent Plaintiff in the 52 case.” (Comp. ¶¶ 8, 66, 73.)
Consequently, Plaintiff is subject to the 52 Letter’s arbitration provision under
the equitable estoppel doctrine. John Kaiser, a nonsignatory, may enforce the provision
against Plaintiff as an alleged agent of Kaiser Legal Services, the signatory.
(Comp. ¶ 5; Thomas v. Westlake (2012) 204 Cal.App.4th 605, 614 [“[W]hen a
plaintiff alleges a defendant acted as an agent of a party to an arbitration
agreement, the defendant may enforce the agreement even though the defendant is
not a party thereto.”].)
 
The 50 Letter, signed by
Plaintiff in his individual capacity (Kaiser Reply Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. B), clearly
applies to Plaintiff’s claims.
