And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Defendant/Cross-Complainant Holly Seeler's motion for a protective order in part, requiring the parties to meet and confer to schedule a continued deposition date for Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Erin Hughes within 60 days. The judge also grants Seeler's request for monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $1,560, payable by Hughes and her counsel. The judge denies Hughes' request for monetary sanctions.

The judge finds that Hughes' "combative, hostile, and unprofessional behavior" during her deposition was inappropriate and that Seeler has shown good cause for a protective order. The judge also finds that Hughes and her counsel opposed Seeler's motion without substantial justification and therefore awarded sanctions.

The judge notes that while Seeler's motion is granted in part, the judge is not inclined to require the services of a discovery referee. The judge trusts that Hughes and her counsel will discontinue their personal attacks and meaningfully participate in future deposition sessions.
