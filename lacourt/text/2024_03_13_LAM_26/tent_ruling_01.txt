  Case No.:  21STCV21191
 
  Hearing Date:  March 13, 2024
 
[TENTATIVE] order RE:
Defendant kia america, inc.’s motion to
  tax costs
 
 



 
Procedural Background
            On June 4, 2021, Plaintiffs Vanessa
Johnson Ibarra and Edwin Ibarra (jointly “Plaintiffs”) filed the instant action
arising out of the lease, then purchase of a 2013 Kia Sorrento (“Subject
Vehicle”) against Defendants Kia America, Inc. (“Kia”), Ryan Cars, LLC, Pomona
Kia.  The complaint asserts three causes
of action for (1) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty,
(2) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Implied Warranty, and (3) Negligent
Repair.  
            On May 17, 2023, the parties advised
in open court that they had reached a settlement, and Plaintiffs dismissed the
action with the Court retaining jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure
section 664.6.  (Minute Order 5/17/23.)
            On July 24, 2023, Defendant Kia
filed the instant motion to tax costs. 
On February 29, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an opposition.  On March 6, 2024, Defendant Kia filed a
reply.
 
Legal Standard
“A prevailing party is entitled ‘as a
matter of right’ to recover costs in any action or proceeding unless a statute
expressly provides otherwise.”  (Segal
v. ASICS America Corp. (2022) 12 Cal.5th 651, 658.)  “Section 1033.5 sets forth the types of
expenses that are and are not allowable as costs under section 1032.
Specifically, subdivision (a) of section 1033.5 describes items that are ‘allowable
as costs,’ subdivision (b) describes items ‘not allowable as costs, except when
expressly authorized by law,’ and section 1033.5(c)(4) provides that ‘[i]tems
not mentioned in this section and items assessed upon application may be
allowed or denied in the court's discretion.’” 
(Ibid.)
To recover a cost, it must be reasonably
necessary to the litigation and reasonable in amount. (Perko’s Enterprises, Inc. v. RRNS Enterprises (l992) 4 Cal.App.4th
238, 244.) If the items appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper charges,
the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were not
reasonable or necessary. (Ladas v.
California State Automotive Assoc. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 773-74.)  On the other hand, if the items are properly
objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on the party
claiming them as costs. (Id.)  
California Rule of Court, Rule 3.1700
requires that “[a]ny notice of motion to strike or to tax costs must be served
and filed 15 days after service of the cost memorandum. If the cost memorandum
was served by mail, the period is extended” by up to 20 days. (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1700(b)(1).) Additionally, “[T]he court may extend the times for
serving and filing the cost memorandum or the notice of motion or tax costs for
a period not to exceed 30 days.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1700(b)(3).)  
 
Discussion
            Defendant
Kia seeks to tax a total of $24,765.85 in costs as follows (1) $735.00 in
filing and motion fees, claimed under Item 1; (2) $2,766.15 in deposition
costs, claimed under Item 4; (3) $688.78 in service of process costs, claimed
under Item 5; (5) $9,464.87 for expert witness fees, claimed under Item 8b; (7)
$4,600.00 for Court reporter fees, claimed under Item 12; and (8) $6,511.05 for
attorney services and messengers, appearance attorneys and travel, claimed
under Item 13.
“If items on a memorandum of costs appear
to be proper charges on their face, those items are prima facie evidence that
the costs, expenses, and services are proper and necessarily incurred.
[Citation.] The burden then shifts to the objecting party to show them to be
unnecessary or unreasonable.”  (Doe v.
Los Angeles County Dept. of Children & Family Services (2019) 37
Cal.App.5th 675, 693.)  “[T]he objecting
party has the burden to show that a cost item is unrecoverable because it was
not necessary to the litigation.”  (Hooked
Media Group, Inc. v. Apple Inc. (2020) 55 Cal.App.5th 323, 338.)  “It
is not necessary that the [moving party], …, accompany the motion to tax cost
with any affidavit.”  (State of
California v. Meyer (1985) 174 Cal.App.3d 1061, 1075.)  “However,
more than a bare objection is needed to rebut the presumption that fees were
reasonable and necessarily incurred.”  (State
of California, supra, 174 Cal.App.3d at p.1075.)
Here, Plaintiffs are prevailing buyers under the
Song-Beverly Act.  “Section 1794,
subdivision (d), permits the prevailing buyer to recover both ‘costs’ and
‘expenses.’”  (Jensen v. BMW of North
America, Inc. (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 112, 137.)  
 
The Legislature
added the “costs and expenses” language to section 1794 in 1978. (Stats. 1978,
ch. 991, § 10, p. 3065.) An analysis by the Assembly Committee on Labor,
Employment, and Consumer Affairs states: “Indigent consumers are often
discouraged from seeking legal redress due to court costs. The addition of
awards of 'costs and expenses' by the court to the consumer to cover such
out-of-pocket expenses as filing fees, expert witness fees, marshall’s fees,
etc., should open the litigation process to everyone.” (Assem. Com. on Labor,
Employment & Consumer Affairs, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 3374 (May 24,
1978) p. 2.)
(Id.
at p.138.)
“[T]he Legislature amended section 1794 to
provide for the recovery of “costs and expenses.” The
legislative history indicates the Legislature exercised its power to permit the
recovery of expert witness fees by prevailing buyers under the Act[.]”  (Ibid.)  “[T]he Legislature intended the phrase ‘costs
and expenses’ to cover items not included in ‘the detailed statutory definition
of “costs” ’ set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5.”  (Warren v. Kia Motors America, Inc. (2018)
30 Cal.App.5th 24, 42.)  Therefore, a
prevailing buyer is entitled to “costs and expenses” that have been “determined
by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with
the commencement and prosecution of such action.”  (Civ. Code, § 1794(d).)
 
Filing
Fees
Filing fees are expressly allowable as
costs. (CCP §1033.5(a)(1).)  Thus, the
burden is on Defendant Kia to show that the $735.00 in filing costs was not reasonably necessary for the
litigation.  Defendant Kia fails to meet
this burden.  Defendant Kia merely claims
that each of the filing fees it seeks to tax was for an unnecessary motions
that did not advance the litigation.  However,
Defendant fails to submit any evidence to support this claim.  A memorandum is not evidence and “the court
must disregard ‘facts’ contained in an unverified statement.”  (Smith, Smith & Kring v. Superior
Court (Oliver) (1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 573, 578.)  Though some of the motions might not have
been reasonably necessary, Defendant fails to show as such.  
However, as Plaintiffs concede in
opposition, $100.00 of filing fees were not incurred.  Accordingly, $100.00 in claimed filing fees
are stricken.
 
Deposition
Costs
            Defendant Kia seeks to tax $2,766.15
in deposition costs and $688.78 in service of process costs.  The costs for taking, video recording, and
transcribing necessary depositions are expressly permitted as costs.  (CCP § 1033.5(a)(3)(A).)  Similarly, service of process and witness
fees are expressly permitted.  (CCP §
1033.5(a)(4),(7).)  Therefore, the burden
is on Defendant Kia to show that these costs are unnecessary or
unreasonable.  Defendant Kia fails to do
so.  
            Defendant argues that the deposition
fees of service technicians were unnecessary because “Plaintiffs’ attorneys
profess to be experts in this area of the law. Given their expertise and their
knowledge of the relevant facts at the outset of the litigation, Plaintiffs'
attorneys know there is no reason to take the depositions of service advisors
and technicians because the service advisors and technicians keep a
contemporaneous record of their work on the repair orders they prepare each
time they work on a vehicle. Plaintiffs' attorneys also know the service
advisors and technicians work on hundreds of vehicles each year and cannot
remember each one. There was no reason to incur the cost of serving deposition
subpoenas on and taking the depositions of the service advisors and technicians
in this case.”  (Motion at p.6:7-15.)  However, Defendant again
fails to submit any evidence to support this claim.  A memorandum is not evidence and “the court
must disregard ‘facts’ contained in an unverified statement.”  (Smith, Smith & Kring, supra, 60
Cal.App.4th at p.578.)  At most,
Defendant Kia merely provides general objections to these costs.  This is insufficient to tax a permitted
cost.  (State of California, supra,
174 Cal.App.3d at p.1075.)  
 
Expert
Witness Fees
            Expert witness fees are generally
not permitted unless ordered by the court under Code of Civil section
1033.5(a)(8) or “except when expressly authorized by law.”  (CCP § 1038(b).)  However, Plaintiffs are prevailing buyers
under the Song-Beverly Act.  “Section
1794, subdivision (d), permits the prevailing buyer to recover both ‘costs’ and
‘expenses.’”  (Jensen v. BMW of North
America, Inc. (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 112, 137.)  
 
The Legislature
added the “costs and expenses” language to section 1794 in 1978. (Stats. 1978,
ch. 991, § 10, p. 3065.) An analysis by the Assembly Committee on Labor,
Employment, and Consumer Affairs states: “Indigent consumers are often
discouraged from seeking legal redress due to court costs. The addition of
awards of 'costs and expenses' by the court to the consumer to cover such
out-of-pocket expenses as filing fees, expert witness fees, marshall’s fees,
etc., should open the litigation process to everyone.” (Assem. Com. on Labor,
Employment & Consumer Affairs, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 3374 (May 24,
1978) p. 2.)
(Id.
at p.138.)
“[T]he Legislature amended section 1794 to
provide for the recovery of “costs and expenses.” The
legislative history indicates the Legislature exercised its power to permit the
recovery of expert witness fees by prevailing buyers under the Act[.]”  (Ibid.)  “[T]he Legislature intended the phrase ‘costs
and expenses’ to cover items not included in ‘the detailed statutory definition
of “costs” ’ set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5.”  (Warren v. Kia Motors America, Inc. (2018)
30 Cal.App.5th 24, 42.)  Therefore, a
prevailing buyer is entitled to “costs and expenses” that have been “determined
by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with
the commencement and prosecution of such action.”  (Civ. Code, § 1794(d).)
Expert fees clearly fall within the
intended expenses and legislative history of Civil Code section 1794.  (Jensen, supra, 35 Cal.App.4th at
p.138.)  Moreover, expert witness fees
are expenses that are clearly reasonably incurred by the buyer with the
commencement and prosecution of such action. 

However, not all of the claimed expert
fees here are reasonable or incurred in connection with the Song-Beverly
Claims.
As to expert Anthony Micale, the expert
fee is excessive.  As Plaintiff stated
under oath during expert witness disclosure, Micale’s hourly rates were $350.00
per hour for providing deposition testimony and or consulting with the
retaining attorney, $350.00 per hour for vehicle inspections and investigations
and $150.00 per hour for travel and an additional $0.55 per mile.  (Rotman Decl. ¶ 10, Exh. 7.)  Per the invoice provided, Micale claimed
expert fees of 27.25 hours at $400 per hour, mileage fees of 0.585 per hour,
meal costs of $168.70, parking fees of $5, and hotel fees of $315.14.  (Rotman Decl. ¶ 8, Exhs. 5-6.)  As Plaintiffs’ Counsel was required by statute
to provide accurate expert fees under penalty of perjury, (CCP § 2034.260(c)), the
Court concludes that Micale’s invoice is erroneous and that the reasonably incurred
fees are reflected in Plaintiff’s Counsel’s disclosure of the hourly rate.  Further, the travel time and deposition
preparation time are slightly excessive, especially given that only 30 minutes
were spent reviewing the vehicle.  Thus,
the Court concludes a reduction of $1,375.00 is warranted. 
 
Court
Reporter Fees
            Defendant contends that the Court
reporter fees are excessive on their face because they exceed the Los Angeles
Superior Court fee schedule and were not reasonably incurred.  In general, Court reporter fees are only
permitted in the amount established by statute. 
(CCP § 1033.5(a)(11).)  Moreover,
such costs must have been reasonably incurred. 
(CCP § 1033.5(c)(2).)  Even under
the more expansive expenses for Song-Beverly Claims, the fees must be
reasonably incurred in the prosecution of the Song-Beverly Claims.  
            Here, there was no motion or hearing
that would require a court reporter as little to no motion practice occurred in
the instant action.  The billing for the
court reporter hearings provides for only seven one-hour hearings of which only
one was for a motion.  (Rotman Decl. ¶
11, Exh. 8.)  Multiple of these hearings
involved simple ex parte applications to continue trial where undoubtedly a
court reporter was unnecessary.  Thus, a reduction
of $3,450.00 in claimed court reporter fees is warranted.
 
 
Other
Fees
Here, the memorandum claims $6,511.05 in other
fees including attorney travel costs, fees, legal research fees, mediation,
private investigator lookup, courtesy copies, postage, and other fees.
Here, Plaintiffs’ firm is from San Diego.  Thus, lodging and transportation costs for
the trial are expenses “reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the
… prosecution of such action.”  (Civ.
Code, § 1794(d).)  Though Defendant Kia
disputes the price of the hotel, Defendant Kia fails to provide any prices of
nearby hotels for the relevant time period so as to enable the Court to
determine whether the hotel costs were unreasonable.  As to the meal expenses, these were not
reasonably incurred in connection with the prosecution of the action “since
attorneys have to eat, whether they are conducting litigation or not.”  (Ladas v. California State Auto. Assn. (1993)
19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774.)  Similarly,
Plaintiffs’ counsel brought non-Song-Beverly Claims in the instant action, and Plaintiffs’
counsel cannot unilaterally claim that all legal research fees were incurred for
these claims.  Further, Plaintiffs’
counsel agrees that $318 in costs were improperly claimed.  Accordingly, the Court finds that $955.66 of other
costs were not reasonably incurred and are therefore taxed.
Conclusion and ORDER
Based
on the foregoing, Defendant Kia Motors America, Inc.’s motion to tax costs is
GRANTED IN PART.  
Plaintiffs’
costs are granted in the total amount of $24,278.73.
Moving
Party to give notice and file proof of service of such.
