And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's ex parte application for a judicial determination of the scope of the automatic stay. The plaintiff sought to have the application deemed a motion and set a hearing date, but the judge found that the plaintiff failed to show irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for granting relief on an ex parte basis. The judge also found that the plaintiff did not demonstrate good cause to advance the hearing on a motion seeking this relief. As a result, the plaintiff must bring a noticed motion to obtain the relief sought, and a hearing date will be set through the online Court Reservation System (CRS).
