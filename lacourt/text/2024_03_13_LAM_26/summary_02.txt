Here is the summary in English text:

The Judge is considering a tentative ruling on the ex parte application to continue the trial. The moving parties, SFV PORTFOLIO 14612-14654 BLYTHE OWNER LP, SFV PORTFOLIO G.P. LLC, and ENCORE 14612-14654, BLYTHE LLC, have failed to indicate whether they have met and conferred with all other parties in this action as to their availability for trial on the new date proposed, August 12, 2024. The Court has previously granted a continuance of the trial date on October 27, 2023, and the parties had stipulated to a discovery plan. However, the moving parties have failed to demonstrate that they have exercised diligence in pursuing discovery and have failed to complete fact discovery in January, February, and March 2024, and expert discovery in April 2024, as stipulated. The Judge orders the moving parties to file supplemental papers addressing the defects in their application by March 15, 2024, and to file a stipulation signed by all parties and proposed order setting forth a firm discovery plan and a joint discovery plan with stipulated firm dates for all witnesses and deadlines for exchange of written discovery.
