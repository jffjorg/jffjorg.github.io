And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to continue the trial date, which was previously set for January 13, 2025. The trial date is now continued to a date to be determined (TBD). The final status conference and related discovery deadlines are also continued to the new trial date. The judge found good cause to continue the trial date because the parties are still conducting necessary discovery and are not yet prepared for trial. The judge noted that the parties would be forced to proceed with trial preparation without sufficient discovery if the trial date were not continued, and that a continuance is necessary to properly prepare for trial. The judge also rejected the plaintiff's argument that the defendants have been stalling the action, finding that the plaintiff's allegations of prejudice were not sufficient to warrant a denial of the continuance.
