And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiffs' application for a right to attach order and writ of attachment against the defendant, Christian Rodolfo Nunez Ramirez. The plaintiffs, David Smith and Cheyanne Kane, are seeking to attach assets worth $1,876,667.20 to secure their claim for disgorgement of payment made to an unlicensed contractor. The judge found that the claim has probable validity and that the attachment is not sought for a purpose other than recovery on the claim. The defendant objected to the attachment, but the judge found that the plaintiffs have provided sufficient evidence to support their claim. The judge also ordered the plaintiffs to file an undertaking in the amount of $10,000 within 20 days of the entry of the order.
