  - "The court must not permit a record to be filed under seal based solely on the agreement or stipulation of the parties." (California Rules of Court, rule 2.551, subdivision (a))

As for the summary of the Judge's tentative ruling, the Judge has denied the Judgment Debtors' motion to seal certain documents containing confidential financial information. The Judge found that the Judgment Debtors had not met the burden of showing that the documents contained confidential information and that the public has a First Amendment right of access to these documents. The Judge also noted that the moving party's obligation is to show that there exists an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record, and that the Judgment Debtors had not met this burden. Additionally, the Judge found that the proposed order did not meet the requirements of the Code, which require that the order sealing an otherwise public filing make specific findings and direct the sealing of only those documents and pages that contain the material that needs to be placed under seal.
