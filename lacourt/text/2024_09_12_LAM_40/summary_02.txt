And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that Defendant General Motors LLC's demurrer to Plaintiff Scott E. Scaife's complaint is moot. The demurrer was filed on June 4, 2024, and Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) on August 29, 2024. The judge finds that Plaintiff was entitled to file the FAC as a matter of right, as it was filed nine court days prior to the hearing date. The judge concludes that the demurrer is off calendar and moot, and therefore, the demurrer is denied.
