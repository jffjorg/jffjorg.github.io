The text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling is:

The judge has granted the motions to compel deposition and requests for production of documents filed by Gap and Art City Center. The motions were filed against Yeezy Supply, which has failed to appear for examination or produce documents despite being properly served with deposition notices. The judge finds that there is good cause justifying the deposition and production of the requested documents, which seek information related to the condition, modifications, and maintenance of the Premises, the corporate existence and records of Yeezy Supply, and the terms of the relationship between Gap and the Yeezy Parties. The judge also finds that the deposition notices were sufficient to compel Yeezy Supply's attendance, testimony, and document production at the deposition. The motions are granted, allowing Gap and Art City Center to proceed with their depositions and requests for production of documents.
