 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Defendant General
  Motors LLC’s Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint



 
I. Background
A. Pleadings
On April 4, 2024, Plaintiff Scott
Scaife (Scaife) filed a Complaint against Defendants General Motors LLC (GM) and
Does 1 through 10 (collectively, Defendants) alleging causes of action for breach
of warranty under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, breach of the implied
warranty of merchantability, and fraudulent inducement. On or about May 25,
2019, Scaife purchased a 2019 Chevrolet Silverado. He alleges that defects and
issues, including with the vehicle’s transmission and engine, have arisen and
that GM has failed to fulfill its warranty obligations. Scaife alleges that
said defects and nonconformities substantially impair the use, value and safety
of the vehicle. 
B. Motion Before the Court
On May 6, GM’s Counsel filed a declaration
stating that they had not yet been able to meet and confer with Scaife’s
counsel. Counsel met and conferred on June 4, 2024, but were unable to reach a
resolution. On June 4, 2024, GM filed this demurrer to the complaint.
On August 29, 2024, Scaife filed a
First Amended Complaint (FAC). Proof of service shows that the FAC was served
on GM on August 29, 2024 via e-mail. 
No answers, oppositions, or replies
are on file with the Court. 
 
II. Motion
A. Legal Standard
“A party may amend its pleading once
without leave of the court at any time before the answer, demurrer, or motion
to strike is filed, or after a demurrer or motion to strike is filed but before
the demurrer or motion to strike is heard if the amended pleading is filed and
served no later than the date for filing an opposition to the demurrer or
motion to strike. A party may amend the pleading after the date for filing an
opposition to the demurrer or motion to strike, upon stipulation by the
parties.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 472, subd. (a).) “All papers opposing a motion so
noticed shall be filed with the court and a copy served on each party at least
nine court days … before the hearing.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).)
“[T]he filing of an amended complaint moots a motion directed to a prior
complaint.” (JKC3H8 v. Colton (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 468, 477; see also Sylmar
Air Conditioning v. Pueblo Contracting Services, Inc. (2004) 122
Cal.App.4th 1049, 1054 [“The filing of [a] first amended complaint render[s] [a
movant’s] demurrer moot since “‘an amendatory pleading supersedes the original
one, which ceases to perform any function as a pleading”’” (citations
omitted)].) Accordingly, a “demurrer [directed to the original pleading] should
[be] taken off calendar” when an amended complaint is filed. (People ex rel.
Strathmann v. Acacia Research Corp. (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 487, 506.) 
However, this right is limited to the
amendment of a complaint initiating an action into a first amended complaint;
otherwise stated, a party cannot amend an already amended complaint as a matter
of course even though a demurrer has been directed to the operative and already
amended pleading. (Hedwall v. PCMV, LLC (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 564,
572-579 [holding, as a matter of first impression, that a party’s right to
amend a pleading as a matter of course under Code of Civil Procedure section
472, subdivision (a) is limited to the original pleading commencing the
action].) Further, one defendant’s filing of an answer did not divest the
plaintiff of the right to amend the complaint with respect to the causes of
action brought against other demurring defendants. (Barton v. Kahn
(2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1219-1221.) 
D. Analysis
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
sections 472, subdivision (a), Scaife was entitled to, as a matter of right,
file a FAC as of August 29, 2024, nine court days prior to this hearing. 
Scaife filed the FAC on
August 29, 2024. Thus, Scaife’s filing the FAC renders the subject demurrer
moot. (See CCP § 472 subd. (a); JKC3H8,
supra, 221 Cal.App.4th at 477.) 
III. Conclusion
Defendant General Motors LLC’s Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint is OFF CALENDAR
as MOOT.
