And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has revised their tentative ruling after confusion at the hearing and further review. The judge is denying the plaintiffs' motion to compel the deposition of Kiara Janine Booker without prejudice. The judge is unable to determine whether Kiara Janine Booker is the same person as the named defendant Kara Booker. The judge finds that the proof of service attached to the motion papers is insufficient and that the notice of hearing was not properly served. The judge notes that if Kiara Janine Booker and Kara Booker are not the same person, then the motion papers and notice of hearing needed to be personally served on Kiara Janine Booker. The judge also finds that the plaintiffs did not provide sufficient evidence that the motion papers and notice of hearing were served on any person or entity. Therefore, the judge is denying the motion to compel without prejudice. The judge will set a new hearing date for counsel to address the revised ruling.
