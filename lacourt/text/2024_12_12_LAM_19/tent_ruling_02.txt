DISCUSSION
 
As an initial matter, Defendant
failed to file any opposition, effectively conceding to the merits of the
Motion and consenting to the Court granting the relief requested. (See Cal. R.
Ct., 8.54(c) [“A failure to oppose a motion may be deemed a consent to the
granting of the motion.”]; Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)
 
I.                  
Procedural Requirements
 
Before bringing a motion to compel further responses to any
discovery request, the moving party is required to make efforts to meet and
confer in good faith and must submit a declaration attesting to those efforts.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(b); 2031.310(b)(2); 2033.290(b).) “A meet and
confer declaration in support of a motion shall state facts showing a
reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue
presented by the motion.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2016.040.) However, a
discovery motion need not be denied automatically based upon the reason that
the moving parties failed to meet and confer in good faith. (See Obregon
v. Sup. Ct. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424, 434.)  
 
The notice of motion must be
served “within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any
supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific later date to
which the propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing…”;
otherwise, the demanding party waives the right to compel any further
responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(c); 2031.310(c); 2033.290(c); Sperber
v. Robinson (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 736, 745; see also Code Civ. Proc., §
1013 [extending notice time if served by mail, overnight delivery, or fax].)
The 45-day time limit is mandatory and jurisdictional. (Sexton v. Sup.Ct.
(Mullikin Med. Ctr.) (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.) 
 
Any motion involving the content of a discovery request or the
responses to such a request shall also be accompanied by a separate statement
providing all information necessary to understand each discovery request and
all the responses at issue. (Cal.
R. Ct., 3.1345(a), (c).)
 
Here, in her declaration filed
with the Motion, Plaintiff’s counsel attests that the responses in question
were served on September 16, 2022. (April Ramirez Decl., ¶ 7.) Although the
instant Motion was not filed and served until August 26, 2024, Plaintiff
contends, with evidence, that the responses remain unverified. (Motion, p. 6;
Ramirez Decl. at ¶ 7, Ex. 4.)
 
Thus, the Court finds that the
Motion is timely. Plaintiff filed the requisite separate
statement. The Court finds the declaration of April Ramirez satisfies the meet
and confer requirements. 
 
II.               
Merits
 
A.   
Motion to Compel Verification
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2030.050 provides that:
 
(a) The party
to whom the interrogatories are directed shall sign the response under oath
unless the response contains only objections.
(b) If that
party is a public or private corporation, or a partnership, association, or
governmental agency, one of its officers or agents shall sign the response
under oath on behalf of that party. If the officer or agent signing the
response on behalf of that party is an attorney acting in that capacity for the
party, that party waives any lawyer-client privilege and any protection for
work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010) during any
subsequent discovery from that attorney concerning the identity of the sources
of the information contained in the response.
(c) The
attorney for the responding party shall sign any responses that contain an
objection.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.050.)
 
The Court agrees with
Plaintiff that, since Defendant’s responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories (Employment), Set
One included substantive responses, (Ramirez Decl. at ¶ 7,
Ex. 4), Defendant was required to provide a verification. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.250(a).)
 
Thus, the Court GRANTS
Plaintiff’s request for an order compelling Defendant to provide proper
verifications for the responses.
 
B.     Sanctions
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300, subdivision (d)
provides that:
 
The court shall impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a
further response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300(d).)
 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 2023.040 provides that:
 
A request for a sanction shall, in the notice of motion, identify every
person, party, and attorney against whom the sanction is sought, and specify
the type of sanction sought. The notice of motion shall be supported by a
memorandum of points and authorities, and accompanied by a declaration setting
forth facts supporting the amount of any monetary sanction sought.
(Code Civ. Proc.,
2023.040.)
 
Given the lack of verifications, and Defendant’s failure to file any opposition, the Court finds that an imposition of a monetary sanction is warranted.
 
After consideration of the
declaration of April Ramirez, (see Ramirez Decl. at ¶¶ 12-15), and relying on its own knowledge and
familiarity with the legal market, (569 East County Boulevard LLC v.
Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc. (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 426, 437), the Court finds that the hourly rate of $450.00 per hour is reasonable. 
 
The Court finds the 0.5
hours to review the discovery responses, the 0.5 hours to meet and confer, and
the 2.5 hours to prepare the Motion, are reasonable.
 
However, the Court only
awards 0.5 hours to prepare the separate statement because the separate
statement is less than one page and copies and pastes from the Motion. (See
Motion at p. 5.)
 
The Court also awards 1.5
hours to prepare for and attend the hearing. However, given the lack of any
opposition, the Court does not award the 2.0 hours requested to review the
opposition and prepare a reply. 
 
Thus, the Court awards
attorney’s fees for 6.5 hours, for a total of $2,925.00 in attorney’s fees.
 
The Court also awards
$61.65 in costs for the filing fee, (Ramirez Decl. at ¶ 12), for a total award
of $2,986.65.
 
As such, the Court GRANTS
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions against Defendant and its counsel of record,
jointly and severally, in the reduced amount of $2,986.65.
