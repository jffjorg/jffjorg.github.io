And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to compel compliance with a deposition subpoena for personal appearance and requests for monetary sanctions. The defendant is seeking to depose Jamel Adams, the plaintiff's brother, as a key witness in the case. The judge finds that the defendant has sufficiently established that the deposition subpoena was properly served on Jamel Adams and that he failed to comply with it. As a result, the judge orders Jamel Adams to sit for a deposition via remote video conference by January 30, 2025.

The judge also grants the defendant's request for monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $1,120.00. This amount was calculated based on the defendant's attorney's fees and costs incurred due to Jamel Adams' failure to comply with the deposition subpoena. The judge finds that the defendant's request for attorney's fees and costs is reasonable and that Jamel Adams' failure to comply with the deposition subpoena was a misuse of the discovery process.
