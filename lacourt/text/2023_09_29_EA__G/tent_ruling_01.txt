BACKGROUND
This is a personal injury
action. In May 2021, Plaintiff Edward Salazar Murrieta was driving a vehicle on
Interstate 210 in Glendora with three passengers including Plaintiffs Alma
Ruelas, Nevaeh Murrieta[1],
and Breeana Murrieta. At the same time, while Defendant Antonio Reyver
Campos-Perez was operating a vehicle owned by Defendants Service Trans LLC and
Estrellita Peralta, Plaintiffs allege Campos-Perez rear-ended them.
On February 3, 2023, Plaintiffs
filed a complaint against Campos-Perez, Service Trans, Peralta, and Does 1-20,
alleging the following causes of action: (1) general negligence and (2) motor
vehicle negligence.
On August 11, 2023, Ruelas filed
the present petition on the behalf of Breeana. On the same day, Jaqueline Lopez
filed the present petition on the behalf of Nevaeh. A hearing on the petitions
is set for September 20, 2023, with a OSC Re: Dismissal set for October 3.
ANALYSIS
Plaintiffs
petition for the court’s approval of a $993,186.89 settlement reached between
Defendants and Plaintiffs.
Legal Standard
An
enforceable settlement of a minor’s or incompetent’s claim can only be
consummated with court approval. (Prob. Code, §§ 2504, 3500, 3600 et seq.; Code
Civ. Proc., § 372.) For this purpose, a petition for approval must be presented
to the court and until it is granted, there is no final settlement. (Scruton
v. Korean Air Lines Co. (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1596, 1603-1606.) Any
settlement agreement therefore is voidable by the minor’s guardian ad litem. (Id.,
at p. 1606.)
Probate
Code section 3600, et seq., governs how the settlement proceeds are to be paid.
Pursuant to Probate Code section 3601, the order shall approve payment of
reasonable expenses from the settlement as follows:
The court making the order or giving the judgment
referred to in Section 3600, as a part thereof, shall make a further order
authorizing and directing that such reasonable expenses (medical or otherwise
and including reimbursement to a parent, guardian, or conservator), costs, and
attorney’s fees, as the court shall approve and allow therein, shall be paid
from the money or other property to be paid or delivered for the benefit of the
minor or incompetent person. (Prob. Code, § 3601, subd. (a).)
In
cases pursuant to Probate Code section 3601, “unless the court has approved the
fee agreement in advance, the court must use a reasonable fee standard when
approving and allowing the amount of attorney’s fees payable from money or
property paid or to be paid for the benefit of a minor or a person with a
disability.” (Cal. Rules of Court 7.955, subd. (a)(1).) In doing so, “[t]he
court must give consideration to the terms of any representation agreement made
between the attorney and the representative of the minor or person with a
disability and must evaluate the agreement based on the facts and circumstances
existing at the time the agreement was made, except where the attorney and the
representative of the minor or person with a disability contemplated that the
attorney's fee would be affected by later events.” (Cal. Rules of Court 7.955,
subd. (a)(2).)
Discussion
The
present action involves personal injuries arising from an automobile accident
on Interstate 210 in Glendora. Breeana suffered soft tissue injuries to her
right shoulder and lower back. Nevaeh suffered soft tissue injuries to her left
rib.
Pursuant to the settlement
agreement reached between the parties, Defendants will pay a total of $993,186.89 to Plaintiffs with Breeana
receiving $2,000 and Nevaeh receiving $1,000.
With regards to attorney
fees, a retainer agreement is attached to the Petitions as Attachment 17a. In
it, the attorney fees for Plaintiffs will be 33% of the gross recovery if a
lawsuit is filed. Thus, Plaintiffs’ counsel requests $500 in attorney fees from
Breeana (25% of total recovery) and $250 from Nevaeh (25% of total recovery).
For Breeana, counsel claims costs in the amount of $30 for medical and billing
records. For Nevaeh, counsel claims costs in the amount of $40.64 for medical
and billing records and postage.
In summary, Breeana will
receive $2,000 minus $500 in attorney fees and $30 in costs for a total net
recovery of $1,470. Nevaeh will receive $1,000 minus $250 in attorney fees and
$40.54 in costs for a total net recovery of $709.46. The petitions request the
funds be paid or delivered to Breeana and Nevaeh’s parents without bond
pursuant to the conditions of Probate Code sections 3401 and 3402.
Based on the petitions, the
court finds the amounts awarded to Breeana and Nevaeh are reasonable. The court
also finds counsel’s recovery of fees in the amount of 25% is reasonable. Last,
the court finds the request to deposit the funds with the parents, in trust for
Breeana and Nevaeh, is proper as the amounts paid do not exceed $5,000. (Prob.
Code, § 3401, subd. (c).)
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiffs’
petitions are GRANTED.
