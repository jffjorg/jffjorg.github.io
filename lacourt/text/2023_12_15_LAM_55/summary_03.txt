And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by defendants Marcel Bruetsch and Capital Benefit, Inc. to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint. The demurrer is sustained as to the first, second, and third causes of action, with 20 days' leave to amend, and overruled as to the fourth. The judge finds that the Quiet Title cause of action fails to allege any of the required elements, and that the fraud claim fails to allege how, when, where, and by what means the representations were tendered. The judge also finds that the breach of contract claim neglects to allege any contract provision of an alleged contract, or any breach of such provision. However, the judge finds that the negligence claim is adequate and alleges a duty to disclose defendants' inability to lawfully do business in California, breach of that duty, and damages to the plaintiff.
