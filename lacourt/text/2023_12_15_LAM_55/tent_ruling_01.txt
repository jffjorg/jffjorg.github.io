  Case Number:  21STCV04008    Hearing Date:   December 15, 2023    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  Motion of Plaintiff to Compel Responses to
Written Discovery, Set Two; Request for Order Awarding Monetary Sanctions
Against Defendant, Lumen Property Management, LLC in the Amount of $1,860.00;  Motion Thereof to Compel the Deposition of
Person Most Qualified for Lumen Property Management, LLC and for Sanctions.
 
Both unopposed motions are granted, as prayed.  The Court will sign and file a proposed order
to be prepared by the moving party. 
 
 
On 2/1/21, MATTHEW SHELLEY (“Plaintiff”) filed a
Complaint alleging that LUMEN PROPERTY MANAGEMENT, LLC (“co-Defendant”) breached
a loan agreement, by failing to timely repay the loan plus interest.  The causes of action are:  (1) Breach of Contract;  (2) Breach of Covenant Of Good Faith And Fair
Dealing;  (3) Breach of Fiduciary Duty;  and (4) Negligent Misrepresentation.
On 6/13/23, the Court filed an order allowing counsel
to withdraw as counsel of record for co-Defendant, pursuant to its reported
consent and desire not to pay for counsel representation. To date, no attorney
has substituted in to represent co-Defendant, a limited liability company. 
 
Plaintiff filed unopposed motions:  1) to compel co-Defendant to serve initial
responses to Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for
Production of Documents (Set Two), and to impose sanctions against co-Defendant
in the sum of $1,860.00, due to no responses served;  and 2) 
to compel the deposition of the person most knowledgeable of co-Defendant,
as well as to impose issue or evidentiary sanctions, and monetary sanctions,
against co-Defendant, in the sum of $2,895.00, due to nonattendance and
noncommunication.
A motion to compel initial discovery responses need
only show that discovery was properly served on the opposing party, the time to
respond expired, and no response was served. 
Leach v. Sup. Ct. (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905-06; CCP
§§2030.290 (compelling initial interrogatory responses), 2031.300 (compelling
initial document requests). 
“Code of Civil Procedure section 2025, subdivision
(d)(6), provides that if a deposition notice describes matters on which
examination is requested, ‘the deponent shall designate and produce at the
deposition those of its officers, directors, managing agents, employees, or
agents who are most qualified to testify on its behalf as to those matters to
the extent of any information known or reasonably available to the
deponent.’"  Maldonado v. Sup. Ct.
(2002) 94 Cal. App. 4th 1390, 1395-98.
Based on proof of co-Defendant’s failures to serve
initial discovery responses, to produce a person most knowledgeable for
deposition, to meet and confer, and to arrange for an attorney to file
oppositions on behalf of the corporation, both motions are granted, as prayed.
Monetary sanctions are mandatory as to parties losing
discovery motions, unless courts find substantial justification or other
injustice.  E.g.,  Foothill Properties v. Lyon/Copley
Corona Assocs., L.P. (1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 1542, 1557-58. Here,
co-Defendant failed to oppose the motions, let alone show substantial
justification for failing to respond to the discovery requests and deposition
notice. Sanctions therefore are mandatory. 
Co-Defendant has not obtained counsel in the six
months following the order granting prior counsel’s motion to be relieved as
counsel. Co-Defendant cannot proceed in this case without counsel. Gamet v. Blanchard (2001) 91 Cal. App. 4th 1276, 1284. The
Court therefore will set an OSC why the Court should not strike co-Defendant’s
answer for failure to obtain counsel, to be held approximately 45 days from the
hearing.
