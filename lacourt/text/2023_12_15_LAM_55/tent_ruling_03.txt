 Case Number:  23STCV07896    Hearing Date:   December 15, 2023    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  Demurrer of Defendants Marcel Bruetsch and
Capital Benefit, Inc. to First Amended Complaint.
 
The demurrer is sustained as to the First Amended
Complaint’s first, second and third causes of action, with 20 days’ leave to
amend, and overruled as to the fourth.
 
 
On 4/10/23, Plaintiff LINDA MAULTSBY filed a Complaint.  On 7/6/23, Plaintiff filed a First Amended
Complaint, alleging:  The lenders, as
to her apartment property at 4757 S. Mansfield, Los Angeles, CA 90026, were
defendants MURAL MEDIA, LLC and S.B.S. TRUST DEED NETWORK that allegedly entered
into the original loan and deed of trust while incapable of legally doing
business in the State of California, due to their filing LLC cancellations.
Defendants BRUETSCH and CAPITALBENEFIT, INC., allegedly acted as agents for
defendants.  Other defendants allegedly represented
themselves as being the lien holders, thereby fraudulently inducing Plaintiff
to enter into loan modification agreements. 
The causes of action are:  1)
Quiet Title;  2) Fraud;  3) Breach of Contract;  and 4) Negligence.
 
Defendants MARCEL BRUETSCH and CAPITAL BENEFIT, INC.
demur to the First Amended Complaint. Plaintiff opposes the demurrer.    
Quiet Title
The elements of a claim for Quiet Title are: 

Description of the property;
plaintiff's title or interest and
     the basis;
defendant’s asserting adverse
     claim or antagonistic property interest;
date as of which the
     determination is sought;  and
prayer for determination of
     title.

 
CCP §761.020.  See also 
Lucas v. Sweet (1956) 47 Cal. 2d 20, 22 (sufficient to plead that plaintiff is the owner of
described property, defendant wrongfully claims interest, unless complaint
reveals a defect in title);  Leeper v.
Beltrami (1959) 53 Cal. 2d 195, 214 (“general rule that a cause of action
to quiet title may be stated in general terms.”).
Here, the First Cause of Action shows no effort at all
to allege any of the elements of Quiet Title, including a legal description of
the property or any allegations that demurring parties made
any claims to the title. 
Fraud
The elements of a claim for fraud are: 

misrepresentation;
     
knowledge of
     falsity (or "scienter");
intent to
     defraud (induce reliance);
justifiable
     reliance; and,
resulting
     damage.

 
E.g., Conroy v. Regents of Univ. of Cal. (2009) 45 Cal. 4th
1244, 1255.
With regard to fraud claims, pleadings must allege
facts as to “‘how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations
were tendered.’"  Stansfield v.
Starkey (1990) 220 Cal. App. 3d 59, 73. To allege fraud, complainants need
not plead specific information that should be within the knowledge of
defendants.  West v. JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 780, 793 (identity of document preparer
was uniquely in bank’s knowledge).  
Here, the fraud claim alleges various
misrepresentations. But the claim fails to allege how, when, where, and by what
means the representations were tendered, or alternatively, facts indicating that
demurring defendants necessarily already know such information.    
 
Breach of Contract
Complainants alleging breach of contract are not
required to attach the contract, or to plead terms verbatim.  Miles v. Deutsche Bank Nat’l Trust Co.
(2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 394, 402 (disapproving Otworth).  “In an action
based on a written contract, the plaintiff may plead the legal effect of the
contract rather than its precise language.” 
Ochs v. PacifiCare of Cal. (2004) 115 Cal. App. 4th 782,
795.  Accord  Construction Protective Services, Inc. v.
TIG Specialty Ins. Co. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 189, 198-99.
General allegations stating that defendants violated a
contract are insufficient, and instead pleaders must state facts showing a
breach.  Levy v. State Farm Mutual
Automobile Ins. Co. (2007) 150 Cal. App. 4th 1, 5-6.  "[A] pleader must state with certainty
the facts constituting a breach of contract."  Melican v. Regents of Univ. of Cal.
(2007) 151 Cal. App. 4th 168, 174.  
Plaintiff’s contract claim incorporates the prior
fraud allegations, and references various sources of law, but neglects to
allege any contract provision of an alleged contract, or any breach of such
provision  (First Amended Complaint, ¶¶ 26
-29).
 
Negligence
The elements of a claim for negligence are: 

Legal duty owed to plaintiffs to
     use due care;  
breach of duty; 
causation;  and
damage to plaintiff.

 
County of Santa Clara v. Atlantic
Richfield Co. (2006) 137 Cal. App. 4th 292,
318;  Ladd v. County of San Mateo
(1996) 12 Cal.4th 913, 917.
“Ordinarily, negligence may be pleaded in general
terms and the plaintiff need not specify the precise act or omission alleged to
constitute the breach of duty.”  Lopez
v. S. Cal. Rapid Transit Dist. (1985) 40 Cal. 3d 780, 795.  Accord  Hahn v. Mirda  (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747;  Crouse v. Brobeck (1998) 67 Cal. App.
4th 1509, 1532 (to allege negligence claims, complainants need only state what
occurred, and generally that the acts were negligently done, but “need not
state the specific act or omission constituting negligent conduct.”).  But see 
Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518,
527 (general allegations must set forth acts or omissions which are said to
have been negligent).  "In order to
state a cause of action for negligence, the complaint must allege facts
sufficient to show a legal duty on the part of the defendant to use due care, a
breach of such legal duty, and the breach as the proximate or legal cause of
the resulting injury."  Bellah v.
Greenson (1978) 81 Cal.App.3d 614, 619. 

Whether defendants owe a legal duty in a particular
factual situation is a question of law. McGarry v. Sax  (2008) 158
Cal.App.4th 983, 994.  The element of duty is
based upon considerations of policy as to whether a particular plaintiff is
entitled to protection.  Coldwell
Banker Residential Brokerage Co. v. Sup. Ct. (2004) 117 Cal. App. 4th 158,
164.  See also  SCC Acquisitions Inc. v. Central Pacific
Bank  (2012) 207 Cal.App.4th 859,
864  (a duty “may be directly imposed by
statute or other prescriptive law; it may be voluntarily assumed by contractual
undertaking; it may arise as an incident of a relationship between the
defendant and the plaintiff; and it may arise as a result of other conduct by
the defendant that makes it wrongful for him to remain silent.”).
According to the above-referenced authorities, the First
Amended Complaint’s general allegations suffice to allege a duty to disclose
defendants’ inability to lawfully do business in California, based upon
defendants being agents of the lender contracting with Plaintiff  (First Amended Complaint, ¶¶ 28-29).  Further, the complaint adequately alleges
breach of that duty, causing Plaintiff to contract with a lender and then an
assignee, both of which lacked the capacity to legally conduct business in
California, and to sustain damages such as the loss of Plaintiff’s real
property  (id. at ¶¶ 30-31).
Therefore, there is no basis to sustain the demurrer
to the negligence claim.
