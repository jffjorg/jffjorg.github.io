Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling sustains the Defendant's demurrer to the First Amended Complaint with leave to amend. The Plaintiff may serve and file a Second Amended Complaint no later than January 17, 2024. The motion for leave to amend is ordered off calendar as moot. The demurrer is sustained based on the lack of opposition and the merits of the case. The Judge also notes that the Plaintiff's motion for leave to amend was procedurally defective, but allows Plaintiff to file a new or amended pleading.
