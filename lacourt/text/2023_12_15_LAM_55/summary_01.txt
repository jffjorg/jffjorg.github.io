And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the plaintiff's unopposed motions to compel discovery responses and deposition, as well as imposing monetary sanctions against the defendant, LUMEN PROPERTY MANAGEMENT, LLC. The defendant failed to serve initial discovery responses, produce a person most knowledgeable for deposition, and meet and confer with the plaintiff. The judge finds that the defendant has not obtained counsel in the six months since the prior counsel was relieved, and therefore, the defendant cannot proceed in the case without counsel. The judge also sets an order to show cause why the defendant's answer should not be struck for failure to obtain counsel. The judge notes that monetary sanctions are mandatory in this case, as the defendant failed to show substantial justification for their failures.
