[TENTATIVE] RULING RE: 
Defendants’ motion FOR ORDER
  GRANTING RELIEF FROM ENTRY OF STIPULATED JUDGMENT ON SEPTEMBER 13, 2024
 











Defendants’
Motion for Order Granting Relief from Entry of Stipulated Judgment on September
13, 2024 is DENIED. 
FACTUAL
BACKGROUND 
This is a breach of contract
matter. The complaint alleges as follows: Plaintiff Hype Factor, LLC (“Hype
Factor”), owned by Sean Kilbane (“Kilbane”) is an entertainment company that
contracted with Defendant JFF Entertainment, LLC (“JFF”). JFF’s principal is Defendant
John Fitzpatrick (“Fitzpatrick”). (Compl. ¶¶ 24-29.) The contract provided that
Hype Factor was to ensure that Fabletics, LLC performed their tasks under the
contract, and that JFF was to ensure that social media talent Catherine Paiz
(“Paiz”) performed her tasks under the contract. (Compl. ¶ 25.) Fitzpatrick/JFF
held themselves out to be Paiz’s talent manager. (Compl. ¶ 21.) Paiz failed to
perform under the contract because Fitzpatrick and JFF failed to inform Paiz
about the agreement because JFF/Fitzpatrick were not Paiz’s talent manager.
(Compl. ¶ 54.) 
PROCEDURAL HISTORY
On July 17, 2019, Plaintiff filed the
Complaint asserting five causes of action:
1.    
Breach of Contract;
2.    
Fraud;
3.    
Conversion;
4.    
Violation of Business Code § 17200 et
seq.; and
5.    
Civil Code liability under Penal
Code § 496(c). 
On
October 9, 2019, Defendants filed a joint Answer to the Complaint. 
On
November 9, 2019, Plaintiff filed an Answer to Defendants’ Cross-Claim.  
On
April 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Enforce Settlement, which was
opposed by Defendants, and to which Plaintiff filed a reply. 
On
May 10, 2024, after hearing oral argument and taking the matter under
submission, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to enforce settlement. 
On
May 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Entry of Stipulated Judgment, which
sought entry of a stipulated judgment in accordance with the terms of the
settlement agreement between Plaintiff and Defendants. 
On
May 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Legal Fees and Costs seeking fees
and costs incurred in enforcing the settlement agreement and entering a
stipulated judgment in accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement
between the parties. 
On
June 20, 2024, Defendants filed an opposition to the motion for entry of
stipulated judgment, and Plaintiff filed a reply brief on June 25, 2024. 
On
June 25, 2024, this action was reassigned from the Honorable Jill Feeney to the
Honorable Michelle C. Kim sitting in Department 78 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse
effective July 5, 2024. 
On
June 27, 2024, Defendants filed a Notice of Appeal, which indicated that
Defendants were appealing the Court’s May 10, 2024 order dismissing the case
and enforcing the settlement agreement. 
On
July 2, 2024, after hearing oral argument, the Court denied Plaintiff’s motion
for entry of stipulated judgment. (07/02/24 Minute Order.) The motion was
denied because the Court had already granted Plaintiff’s motion to enforce
settlement, which rendered the motion for stipulated judgment unnecessary.
(07/02/24 Minute Order at p. 1.) The Court opined that the “parties need not
relitigate arguments pertaining to whether the settlement agreement was
enforceable.” (07/02/24 Minute Order at p. 2.) The Court ordered “Plaintiff . .
. to file a proposed stipulated judgment by July 9, 2024.” (07/02/24 Minute
Order at p. 2.) The Court further indicated that “Defendant’s objections to the
judgment and request for a stay is to be filed and served by July 23, 2024.
Plaintiff’s response is to be filed and served by August 9, 2024.” (07/02/24
Minute Order at p. 2.) The Court set a status conference and hearing on
proposed judgment/request for stay for September 13, 2024, at 8:30 AM.
(07/02/24 Minute Order at p. 2.) Notice was waived. (07/02/24 Minute Order at
p. 2.) 
On
July 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed a memorandum of points and authorities in support
of the entry of stipulated judgment, which indicated on the cover page that the
hearing thereon was set for September 13, 2024. 
On
July 24, 2024, Defendants filed objections to Plaintiff’s July 9, 2024
memorandum. Such objections set forth a September 13, 2024 hearing date on the
cover page thereof. 
On
July 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed a response in support of entry of the stipulated
judgment, which set forth a September 13, 2024 hearing date on the caption page
thereof. 
On
August 12, 2024, Defendants filed an opposition to the motion for attorneys’
fees, to which Plaintiff replied on August 13, 2024. 
On
August 20, 2024, the Court continued the hearing on the motion for attorneys’
fees to December 18, 2024. (08/20/24 Minute Order at p. 3.) The Court also set
a status conference re: appeal for November 18, 2024. (08/20/24 Minute Order at
p. 3.) 
On
September 13, 2024, the Court held a status conference and hearing on proposed
judgment /request for stay. (09/13/24 Minute Order.) There were no appearances
by or for Defendants. (09/13/24 Minute Order.) The Court and Plaintiff’s
counsel conferred regarding the status of the proposed judgment. (09/13/24
Minute Order.) Plaintiff was ordered to file the proposed judgment for the
Court’s signature and was also ordered to give notice. (09/13/24 Minute Order.)

On
September 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed and served a Notice of Ruling of the
Court’s September 13, 2024 order. 
On
September 16, 2024, the Court entered a Stipulated Judgment for Fraud and Civil
Liability under Penal Code § 496(c). Pursuant to the stipulated judgment,
Defendants are to pay Plaintiff, jointly and severally, the sum of $300,000.00,
of which $50,000.00 is for attorneys’ fees. (09/16/24 Stipulated Judgment at p.
1:13-16.) The stipulated judgment notes that “[t]he parties have stipulated to
the entry of the . . . judgment on the basis of Defendants’ failure to timely
pay a settlement according to the terms of the parties’ Settlement Agreement
dated April 1, 2024.” (09/16/24 Stipulated Judgment at p. 1:1-3.) Defendants’
Cross-Complaint was dismissed with prejudice. (09/16/24 Stipulated Judgment at
p. 8:9-10.) 
On
September 25, 2024, Defendants filed and served the instant Motion for Order
Granting Relief from Entry of Stipulated Judgment on September 13, 2024. The
motion is brought on the “grounds that the matter was heard and the order was
entered against Defendants in the absence of Defendants and their counsel due
to the mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect of Defendants’
attorney.” (Not. of Mot. at p. 2:2-4.) 
On
October 15, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition to the motion for an order
granting relief, to which Defendants replied on October 29, 2024. 
DISCUSSION 
I.                
EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
“The
general rule of motion practice . . . is that new evidence is not permitted
with the reply papers.” (Jay v. Mahaffey (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 1522,
1537.) “[P]oints raised for the first time in a reply brief will ordinarily not
be considered, because such consideration would deprive the respondent of an
opportunity to counter that argument.” (Id. at p. 1538.) “[T]he
inclusion of additional evidentiary matter with the reply should only be
allowed in the exceptional case . . . .” (Id. at p. 1537-1538.) 
The
Court SUSTAINS Plaintiff’s evidentiary objection number 1 to the declaration of
J.D. Stewart in support of the reply brief. 
The
Court SUSTAINS Plaintiff’s evidentiary objection number 2 to Defendants’ reply
brief. 
The
Court sustains such objections because Defendants are attempting to introduce
new evidence and new matter which was not raised in the moving papers. In the
moving papers, Defendants contend that their failure to attend the September
13, 2024 hearing was because “counsel mistakenly believed that the Court’s
August 20 order setting an appeal status conference for November 18, 2024,
vacated and replaced the pending status conference and hearing set for
September 13.” (Memo. of Ps and As at p. 3:12-14.) However, for the first time
on reply, Defendants argue and present evidence that their counsel did not
appear at the hearing because counsel’s “calendaring assistant mistakenly
entered the date of the hearing as September 13, 2023, in place of September
13, 2024.” (Reply at p. 3:27-4:1; Stewart Reply Decl., ¶ 7.) It appears that
Defendants are attempting to create an alternate basis for relief, which was
not raised in the moving papers. If such calendaring error did occur,
Defendants should have presented such argument and evidence in the moving
papers.
II.              
MOTION FOR RELIEF FROM ENTRY OF
STIPULATED JUDGMENT 
Defendants move for relief from the
Court’s September 13, 2024 order entering a stipulated judgment against
Defendants.  
“The court may, upon terms as may be
just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment,
dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or
her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
473, subd. (b).) “Application for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy of
the answer or other proposed pleading to be filed therein, otherwise the
application shall not be granted, and shall be made within a reasonable time,
in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or
proceeding was taken.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) 
Code
Civ. Proc. § 473(b) also contains a mandatory relief provision. (SJP Limited
Partnership v. City of Los Angeles (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 511, 516.) 
“[T]he court shall, whenever an application for relief is made no more than six
months after entry of judgment, is in proper form, and is accompanied by an
attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or neglect vacate any (1) resulting default entered by the clerk
against his or her client, and which will result in entry of a default
judgment; or (2) resulting default judgment or dismissal entered against his or
her client, unless the court finds that the default or dismissal was not in
fact caused by the attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.” (Ibid.)
“If the prerequisites of the mandatory relief provision of section 473,
subdivision (b) exist, the trial court does not have discretion to refuse
relief.” (Ibid.)  
“The test for
discretionary relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473 requires the
party seeking relief to show excusable error.” (Comunidad en Accion v. Los
Angeles City Council (2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1132.) “A party who seeks
relief under section 473 on the basis of mistake or inadvertence of counsel
must demonstrate that such mistake, inadvertence, or general neglect was
excusable because the negligence of the attorney is imputed to his client and
may not be offered by the latter as a basis for relief.” (Ibid.,
citation omitted, internal quotations omitted.) “In determining whether the
attorney’s mistake or inadvertence was excusable, the court inquires whether a
reasonably prudent person under the same or similar circumstances might
have made the same error.” (Ibid., citation omitted, internal quotations
omitted, emphasis in original.) Relief is only permitted under the
discretionary provision of CCP § 473 when it involves “mistakes anyone could
have made.” (Ibid., citation omitted, internal quotations omitted.)
“Conduct falling below the professional standard of care, such as the failure
to timely object or to properly advance an argument, is not therefore
excusable.” (Ibid., internal quotations omitted.) “[E]ntering the wrong
date in an attorney’s calendar [is] sufficient to warrant relief under Code of
Civil Procedure section 473.” (Id. at p. 1133.) 
“Whenever
relief is granted based on an attorney’s affidavit of fault, the court shall
direct the attorney to pay reasonable compensatory legal fees and costs to
opposing counsel or parties, in addition to whatever additional fees are
authorized by subdivision (c), of Code Civ. Proc. § 473.” (J.A.T.
Entertainment, Inc. v. Reed (1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 1485, 1491.) Whenever the
court grants relief from a dismissal based on any grounds in Code Civ. Proc. §
473, the Court may: (1) impose a penalty of no greater than one thousand
dollars ($1,000) upon an offending attorney or party; (2) direct that an
offending party pay an amount no greater than one thousand dollars ($1,000) to
the State Bar Client Security Fund; or (3) grant other relief as is
appropriate.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd.
(c)(1)(A)-(C).)    
A.   
Evidence in Support of the Motion
Counsel
for Defendants, J.D. Stewart, Esq. (“Stewart”), provides a declaration. Mr.
Stewart relevantly states the following: On August 20, 2024, the Court heard arguments
for Plaintiff’s motion for attorneys’ fees, which was continued to December 18,
2024, and, at the same time, the Court set an appeal status conference for
November 18, 2024. (Stewart Decl. ¶ 6.) As a result of such hearing and order,
Mr. Stewart reasonably but mistakenly believed that the status conference set
for September 13, 2024, was taken off calendar. (Stewart Decl. ¶ 7.) Mr.
Stewart did not realize this error until early on Sunday, September 15, when he
saw an email from opposing counsel’s office giving notice of the Court’s
September 13 order. (Stewart Decl. ¶ 8.) Mr. Stewart states that he made the
motion as soon as practicable following his discovery and he has never failed
to appear for a hearing in nearly five years of practice. (Stewart Decl. ¶¶
9-10.) 
In
his reply declaration, Mr. Stewart states that “[o]n July 2, 2024, the Court
scheduled a hearing for September 13, 2024, which was labeled on the Court’s
calendar as an appeal status conference.” (Stewart Reply Decl. ¶ 3.) On August
20, 2024, the Court issued an order setting an appeal status conference for
November 18, 2024. (Stewart Reply Decl. ¶ 4.) Mr. Stewart indicates that this
was the best rationale he could conceive for a slated hearing not being on his
office’s master calendar. (Stewart Reply Decl. ¶ 5.) Mr. Stewart indicates that
he “deduced this to be the case because [he] could not imagine another reason
for [his] calendaring assistant to not calendar the hearing or otherwise take
the hearing off calendar.” (Stewart Reply Decl., ¶ 6.) 
B.   
Evidence in Opposition to the Motion
In opposition to the motion, Plaintiff’s
counsel, Thomas Bourke (“Bourke”), provides a declaration. Mr. Bourke presents
evidence that Mr. Stewart knew about the September 13, 2024 hearing date
because he requested such hearing date. (Bourke Decl. ¶¶ 8-10, Ex. A.)
Plaintiff and Defendants each filed documents indicating that the hearing date
concerning the stipulated judgment was set for September 13, 2024. (Bourke
Decl. ¶¶ 11-13, Exs. B, C, D.) Defendants’ opposition to Plaintiff’s motion for
attorneys’ fees recognized that the motion for attorneys’ fees was different
form the motion to enter stipulated judgment. (Bourke Decl. ¶ 14.) The Court
did not mention anything about moving the hearing on the entry of stipulated judgment
set for September 13, 2024. (Bourke Decl. ¶ 17.) The August 20, 2024 minute
order, which continued the hearing on the motion for attorneys’ fees, said
nothing about the September 13, 2024 hearing or moving such hearing. (Bourke
Decl. ¶¶ 18-22, Ex. E.) Mr. Bourke attests that Mr. Stewart did not make a
showing of excusable neglect or mistake, and that he had actual knowledge of
the correct September 13, 2024 hearing date. (Bourke Decl. ¶¶ 30-33.) 
C.   
Defendants
Have Failed to Make a Showing of Excusable Mistake or Excusable Neglect 

The
Court finds that Defendants have not made a showing of mistake or excusable
neglect to warrant relief. Initially, the Court notes that the declaration of
Mr. Stewart contains misstatements of fact. Mr. Stewart declares that, on
August 20, 2024, the Court heard arguments on Plaintiff’s motion for attorneys’
fees, which was continued to December 18, 2024. (Stewart Decl. ¶ 6.) Such
statement is inaccurate as the Court did not conduct a hearing on the motion
for attorneys’ fees. (See 08/20/24 Minute Order at p. 1.) The Court merely
continued the hearing on such motion to December 18, 2024. (08/20/24 Minute
Order at p. 1.) 
Further,
the Court finds that Mr. Stewart’s contention that the Court labeled the
September 13, 2024 hearing as an “appeal status conference” is also inaccurate.
(Stewart Reply Decl. ¶ 3.) A review of eCourt—which is the Court’s electronic
case management system—shows that the September 13, 2024 hearing was calendared
as “Status Conference and hearing on proposed judgment/request for a stay.”
Thus, the September 13, 2024 hearing was never calendared as an appeal status
conference. Moreover, the Court fails to see how counsel thought the September
13, 2024 hearing was taken off calendar when the Court never issued a minute
order or any other indication stating that such hearing was taken off calendar.
(See 07/20/24 and 08/20/24 Minute Orders.) 
The
Court finds that it was unreasonable for Defendants’ counsel to believe that
the September 13, 2024 hearing was taken off calendar. Given that Defendants’
counsel requested that hearing date, as well as received and effectuated
filings showing that such hearing date was still operative and still on
calendar, the Court finds that any belief that the hearing was off calendar was
not a reasonable belief. (Stewart Decl. ¶ 6.) The Court fails to see how the
Court’s August 20, 2024 order—which merely continued the hearing on an
attorneys’ fees motion—caused Defendants’ counsel to believe that the September
13, 2024 hearing, which concerned the proposed stipulated judgment, was taken
off calendar. A reasonably prudent person would have inquired with the Court or
checked the docket to see if the hearing was still on calendar. Thus, the Court
finds that Defendants’ counsel failure to appear at the September 13, 2024
hearing was not due to an excusable mistake or excusable neglect. 
Accordingly,
the Motion for Order Granting Relief from Entry of Stipulated Judgment on
September 13, 2024 is DENIED. 
Defendants to give
notice.
