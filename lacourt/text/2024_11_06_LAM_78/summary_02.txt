Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied LG's motion for attorney fees in this case. LG had argued that it was entitled to attorney fees based on an indemnification clause in the Stock Purchase Agreement (SPA). However, the court found that this clause does not cover attorney fees, as it only specifies them as an item of loss in the event of a third-party claim. The court cited several California cases to support its decision, including Myers Bldg. Indus., Ltd. v. Interface Tech., Inc. and Rideau v. Stewart Title of California, Inc. The court ordered LG to give notice of the denial and encouraged the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court.
