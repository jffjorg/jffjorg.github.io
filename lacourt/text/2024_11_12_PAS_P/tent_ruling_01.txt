  Case Number:  23AHCV00916    Hearing Date:   November 12, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING MOTION BY DEFENDANT TO
GRANT RELIEF FROM ADMISSIONS DEEMED ADMITTEDI.         INTRODUCTION
            This action
arises from a defamation case filed by Plaintiff Ivy Zihan Geng (“Plaintiff”)
against Defendant Ella Tsai (erroneously sued as Wansong Hou) (“Defendant”).
Plaintiff served Requests for Admission (RFAs) on Defendant on August 30, 2023.
Defendant failed to respond to the RFAs by the deadline, prompting Plaintiff to
move to have the RFAs deemed admitted. The Court granted the motion on December
12, 2023, deeming all RFAs admitted and imposing sanctions on Defendant. 
Defendant has since obtained
counsel and now moves to set aside the December 12 order, asserting that her
failure to respond resulted from mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.
Defendant filed this motion on
October 15, 2024. On October 29, 2024, Plaintiff opposed the motion, and on
November 1, 2024, Defendant submitted a reply.
 
Moving arguments
Defendant argues that her failure
to respond to the RFAs resulted from a misunderstanding of U.S. procedural
requirements, given her lack of legal background, limited English proficiency,
and absence of prior experience with the U.S. court system. She asserts that,
under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.330, she is entitled to relief based
on mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.
 
Opposing arguments
Plaintiff opposes the motion,
contending that Defendant’s failure to respond was due not to excusable neglect
but to inexcusable ignorance of the law. Plaintiff further argues that granting
relief from the admissions would cause significant prejudice, as Plaintiff has
relied on these admissions in preparing for the upcoming summary judgment
hearing.
 
Reply arguments 
Defendant reiterates the same
arguments in reply. 
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
A party may withdraw or amend an
admission made in response to a request for admission only on leave of court
granted after notice to all parties. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.300, subd. (a).)
The court may permit the withdrawal only if it determines the admission was the
result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, and the party who
obtained the admission will not be substantially prejudiced in maintaining that
party’s action or defense on the merits.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.300,
subd. (b).) The “mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect” under CCP §
2033.300 have similar meanings as those words used in CCP § 473(b). (New
Albertsons, Inc. v. Superior Court (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1403,
1419.) 
“Because the law strongly favors
trial and disposition on the merits, any doubts in applying section 2033.300
must be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief. Accordingly, the court's
discretion to deny a motion under the statute is limited to circumstances where
it is clear that the mistake, inadvertence, or¿neglect was inexcusable, or
where it is clear that the withdrawal or amendment would not substantially
prejudice the party who obtained the admission in maintaining that party's
action or defense on the merits.” (New Albertsons, Inc., supra,
168 Cal.App.4th at 1420–21.)
 
            III.      DISCUSSION
Defendant moves under CCP §
2033.300, asserting that her failure to respond to RFAs was due to mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect. She argues that her pro per status, lack of
legal training, limited English proficiency, and unfamiliarity with U.S. court
procedures led to a misunderstanding of her obligations in responding to
discovery. Specifically, Defendant claims she did not understand the
consequences of failing to respond and did not believe she could be held
responsible, stating she “blah blah” (Motion, p. 9). Defendant further contends
that she was unable to retain counsel earlier due to financial constraints,
only deciding to hire an attorney after understanding the implications of
Plaintiff’s pending MSJ (Motion, p. 6). Defendant also argues that Plaintiff
will not suffer substantial prejudice if relief is granted, as there is still
time before the March 2025 discovery cutoff to develop the case on the merits
(Motion, pp. 9-10).
Plaintiff counters that Defendant’s
motion for relief is untimely, coming nearly a year after the RFAs were deemed
admitted and only one month before the summary judgment hearing. Plaintiff
contends that ignorance of procedural requirements is not a valid excuse under
California law, as pro per litigants are held to the same standards as
represented parties (Opposition, p. 2). 
(See Monastero v. Los Angeles Transit Co. (1955) 131 Cal. App. 2d
156, 160 ("Under the law one may be his (or her) own attorney if he (or
she) wants to be. A layman with resources who insists upon exercising the
privilege of representing himself must expect and receive the same treatment as
if represented by an attorney -- no different, no better, no worse.")) 
Plaintiff argues that Defendant’s
continuous disregard for discovery requests, meet-and-confer efforts, motions
to compel, and court-ordered sanctions demonstrates inexcusable neglect rather
than mistake or inadvertence. Plaintiff asserts that Defendant knowingly chose
to represent herself despite warnings from the Court and court orders,
resulting in the deemed admissions, not through “mistake, inadvertence, or
excusable neglect” (Id.).
Finally, Plaintiff argues that
granting Defendant’s motion would be prejudicial, as Plaintiff has based her
motion for summary judgment on the deemed admissions since December 2023. With
the hearing less than a month away, setting aside these admissions would impair
Plaintiff’s case preparation and strategy (Opposition, p. 3).
The Court agrees with Plaintiff and
finds that Defendant has not demonstrated mistake, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect that justifies relief. Defendant’s claimed lack of legal knowledge does
not constitute excusable neglect; rather, her prolonged inaction in response to
clear court orders and numerous discovery requests constitutes inexcusable
neglect.
While an honest mistake of law may,
in certain complex and debatable matters, constitute grounds for relief from
judgment, courts have held that relief may properly be denied where the record
reflects only ignorance of the law coupled with negligence in ascertaining it (See
Hopkins & Carley v. Gens (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1401, 135
Cal.Rptr.3d 1). Here, Defendant’s failure to act does not reflect a mere
mistake in a complex matter but rather an inexcusable lack of diligence.
The Court previously issued orders
compelling Defendant’s compliance on December 11, 2023; December 14, 2023; and
hearings were held on November 29, 2023; March 7, 2024; June 12, 2024; and July
19, 2024. These dates provided Defendant with multiple opportunities to engage
with the process or, at a minimum, to seek assistance or clarification
regarding the proceedings. Defendant’s prolonged inaction, despite frequent
court appearances and orders, renders her neglect inexcusable. 
Moreover, although the hearing on
the motion for summary judgment was rescheduled to February 2025, the Court
finds that granting relief would prejudice Plaintiff, who has reasonably relied
on the admissions obtained in December 2023 for nearly eleven months in
preparing the case.
Based on the foregoing, the Court
DENIES Defendant’s motion.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION AND ORDER
            The Court
DENIES Defendant’s motion granting relief from admissions deemed admitted.
Plaintiff is to give notice.
