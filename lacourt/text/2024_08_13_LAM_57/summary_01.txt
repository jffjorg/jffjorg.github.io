And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment, finding that all of the plaintiff's claims are subject to a three-year statute of limitations. The plaintiff, Shara Rodriguez, had argued that two of her claims were subject to a four-year statute of limitations, but failed to offer any evidence to support this contention. The defendants, Joanna Borbon and Francisco Fernando Borbon, had argued that all of the claims were subject to a three-year statute of limitations, and the court agrees with them. The court also notes two procedural defects with Rodriguez's opposition papers, including a late filing and failure to include a separate statement as required by law. As a result, the court is vacating the final status conference and trial in the action and directing the defendants to prepare a proposed order and judgment.
