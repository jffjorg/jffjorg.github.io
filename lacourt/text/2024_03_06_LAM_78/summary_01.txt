And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the defendant's special motion to strike the malicious prosecution cause of action, but denying it as to the defamation cause of action. The judge finds that the defendant's report to law enforcement and request for a civil harassment restraining order constitute protected activity under the anti-SLAPP statute. The judge also finds that the defendant's statements to law enforcement were protected by the litigation privilege, but notes that the exception to the privilege may apply if the defendant acted with reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of the report.

The judge also finds that the plaintiff cannot prevail on his claim of malicious prosecution because the unsuccessful filing of a civil harassment restraining order cannot form the basis of a malicious prosecution claim.

The judge's ruling is based on the pleadings, evidence, and arguments presented by both parties, and is subject to change based on further evidence or argument presented at the hearing.
