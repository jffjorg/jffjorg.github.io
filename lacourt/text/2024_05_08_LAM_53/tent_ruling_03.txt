MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant Cristina Amado Loomis   
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Plaintiff Chris Loomis
Motion to Set Aside Default and Default Judgment, if Entered
The court
considered the moving and opposition papers filed in connection with this
motion.  No reply papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Defendant Cristina Amado Loomis (“Defendant”) moves the court for an
order setting aside her default, entered by the clerk on February 16, 2023, on
the First Amended Complaint filed by plaintiff Chris Loomis (“Plaintiff”),
pursuant to (1) Code of Civil Procedure section 473, (2) Code of Civil
Procedure section 473.5, and (3) Civil Code section 1788.61.
Under section 473, subdivision (b), “[t]he court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or
her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding
taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.  Application for this
relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed
to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall
be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the
judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd.
(b).)  The “six-month time limitation is
jurisdictional; the court has no power to grant relief under section 473 once
the time has lapsed.”  (Austin v. Los
Angeles Unified School District (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 918, 928.)  
Similarly, “[w]hen
service of a summons has not resulted in actual notice to a party in time to
defend the action and a default or default judgment has been entered against
him or her in the action, he or she may serve and file a notice of motion to
set aside the default or default judgment and for leave to defend the
action.  The notice of motion shall be
served and filed within a reasonable time, but in no event exceeding the
earlier of: (i) two years after entry of a default judgment against him or her;
or (ii) 180 days after service on him or her of a written notice that the
default or default judgment has been entered.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5, subd. (a).)  
First, the court finds that Defendant’s motion made pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b) is untimely because it was
filed on March 20, 2024, i.e., more than six months after the clerk entered
Defendant’s default on February 16, 2023. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); Austin, supra,
244 Cal.App.4th at p. 928.)
Second, the court finds that Defendant’s motion made pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 473.5 is untimely because (1) Plaintiff has
submitted evidence establishing that, on February 24, 2023, he served Defendant
with the completed “Request for Entry of Default” form (on which the default of
Defendant was entered by the clerk on February 16, 2023), (2) Defendant filed
this motion on March 20, 2024, and (3) Defendant therefore did not file and
serve this motion no later than 180 days after the February 24, 2023 service of
written notice that her default had been entered.  (Seañez Decl., ¶ 8 [“The entered default was
served by mail”]; Seañez Decl., Ex. F, p. 1 [February 24, 2023 proof of service
of document entitled “Request for Entry of Default”]; Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 473.5, subd. (a).) 
Third, the court denies Defendant’s motion made pursuant to Civil Code
section 1788.61 because (1) that statute applies to service of a summons that
has not resulted in actual notice to a person in time to defend “an action
brought by a debt buyer[,]” and (2) Defendant has not shown that this action
filed by Plaintiff is “an action brought by a debt buyer[.]”  (Civ. Code, § 1788.61, subd. (a)(1).) 
The court therefore denies Defendant’s motion.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 473, subd.
(b), 473.5; Civ. Code, § 1788.61, subd. (a)(1).) 
ORDER
            The court denies defendant Cristina
Amado Loomis’s motion to set aside default and default judgment, if entered.  
            The court orders plaintiff Chris
Loomis to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
