(2)  
Motion
for Leave to Re-File Summons and Cross-Complaint
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with each
motion. 
 
DISCUSSION
The following two motions
filed by defendant and cross-complainant Karlen Galstyan (“Galstyan”) are now
pending before the court: (1) motion for order permitting his Cross-Complaint
to be filed nunc pro tunc as of May 3, 2022, and (2) motion for leave to
re-file his summons and cross-complaint. 
As a threshold matter, the
court notes that, on April 8, 2024, Galstyan filed an ex parte application
seeking an order permitting his Cross-Complaint to be filed nunc pro tunc as of
May 3, 2022.  On April 9, 2024, the court
issued an order (1) denying Galstyan’s ex parte application, but (2) exercising
“its discretion to deem [Galstyan’s] ex parte application to be a motion
seeking the same relief” and setting the hearing on that motion for May 8,
2024.  (April 9, 2024 Minute Order, p.
1.)  Thus, the motion for order
permitting Galstyan’s Cross-Complaint to be filed nunc pro tunc as of May 3,
2022 is properly before the court. 
The court acknowledges, as
defendants Canon Business Properties Inc. (“Canon”) and Scott R. Devore,
Trustee of the Scott R. Devore Revocable Living Trust dated February 13, 2016,
erroneously sued and served as co-trustee of the Don and Bonita Devore Family
Trust dated May 28, 2003, Bonita Devore, erroneously sued and served as
co-trustee of the Don and Bonita Devore Family Trust dated May 28, 2003, Paul
Devore, and Ed Devore (“Devore Defendants”) (collectively, “Defendants”) have
pointed out in their opposition papers, that Galstyan’s second motion for leave
to re-file his summons and complaint appears to seek relief in addition to that
which is requested in the first motion.  However,
Defendants have not cited any authority establishing that Galstyan was required
to obtain leave of court to file such a motion. 

Thus, the court finds that Galstyan
properly filed and served his second motion to re-file the summons and
cross-complaint 16 court days before the May 8, 2024 hearing date and therefore
rules on the merits of the motion.  (Mot.
for Leave, pp. 10-11 [proof of service of personal and electronic service of
motion on April 16, 2024]; Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).)
 
1.    
Motion
for Order Permitting Galstyan’s Cross-Complaint to be Filed Nunc Pro Tunc as of
May 3, 2022
Galstyan moves the court for
an order permitting his Cross-Complaint against Devore Defendants, Canon, and
the City of Los Angeles to be filed in the action filed by plaintiffs Isabel
Castellanos, Lilian Ortega, Antonio Ortega, and Valeria Ortega (Case No.
19STCV42155) (the “Castellanos Action”) nunc pro tunc as of May 3, 2022,
pursuant to (1) California Rules of Court, rule 8.77, and (2) Code of Civil
Procedure section 473.  (Karapetian
Decl., Ex. 3 [Rejected “Cross-Complaint of Karlen Galstyan to Plaintiffs’ First
Amended Complaint for Damages”].) 
Although not raised by the
parties, the court notes that Galstyan already filed a Cross-Complaint against Canon,
Devore Defendants, City of Los Angeles, and plaintiffs Isabel Castellanos,
Lilian Ortega, Antonio Ortega, and Valeria Ortega on June 5, 2020 in the Castellanos
Action (Case No. 19STCV42155) before the court issued its order consolidating
cases numbered 19STCV42155, 20STCV34002, 20STCV42358, and 20STCV34214.  (Galstyan June 5, 2020 Cross-Compl., p.
2:10-15; July 29, 2021 Minute Order, p. 1.) 
Thus, the June 5, 2020 Cross-Complaint is Galstyan’s operative
Cross-Complaint in the Castellanos Action.[1]  However, Galstyan did not advise the court of
that Cross-Complaint in his motion. 
The court finds that Galstyan’s
motion is, in effect, requesting that the court allow him to file an amended
Cross-Complaint in the Castellanos Action nunc pro tunc as of May 3,
2022.  However, a motion to amend a
pleading must (1) set forth the information specified by California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1324, including the identification of the allegations in the
pleading that are proposed to be deleted or added, and (2) be accompanied by a
supporting declaration that specifies the information set forth by that rule,
including the effect of the amendment, why amendment is necessary, and when the
facts giving rise to the amendment were discovered.  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1324, subds. (a),
(b).)  Galstyan did not, as set forth
above, advise the court and the parties that he has already filed a
Cross-Complaint in the Castellanos Action, and has not explained the
effect of the requested amendment as required. 
Thus, the court (1) finds that
Galstyan did not comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, and
therefore (2) denies Galstyan’s motion. 
2.    
Motion
for Leave to Re-File Galstyan’s Summons and Cross-Complaint
Galstyan moves the court for
an order granting him leave to re-file his Cross-Complaint in the Castellanos
Action pursuant to (1) California Rules of Court, rule 8.77, (2) Code of Civil
Procedure sections 426.40, 428.50, and 473, and (3) the court’s inherent
powers.  (Karapetian Decl., Ex. E
[Rejected “Cross-Complaint of Karlen Galstyan to Plaintiffs’ First Amended
Complaint for Damages”].) 
As set forth above, Galstyan already filed a Cross-Complaint in the Castellanos
Action on June 5, 2020.  Thus,
Galstyan’s request that the court grant him leave to file a Cross-Complaint is,
in effect, a request that the court permit him leave to amend his
Cross-Complaint.  A motion to amend a
pleading must comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324. 
For the same reasons as set forth above, the court (1) finds that Galstyan did not comply with
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, and therefore (2) denies Galstyan’s
motion.
ORDER
            The court denies defendant and
cross-complainant Karlen Galstyan’s (1) motion
for order permitting his Cross-Complaint to be filed nunc pro tunc as of May 3,
2022, and (2) motion for leave to re-file his summons and
cross-complaint.
            The court orders defendant Canon
Business Properties, Inc. to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
