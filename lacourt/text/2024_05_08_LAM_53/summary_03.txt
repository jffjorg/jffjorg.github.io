And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment, which was entered on February 16, 2023. The court finds that the defendant's motion is untimely under Code of Civil Procedure sections 473 and 473.5, as it was filed more than six months after the default judgment was entered. The court also finds that the defendant's motion is untimely under Civil Code section 1788.61, as the action filed by the plaintiff is not an action brought by a debt buyer. The court therefore denies the defendant's motion and orders the plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
