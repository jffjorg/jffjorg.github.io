English-text summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying two motions filed by defendant Karlen Galstyan. The first motion seeks to allow Galstyan to file his Cross-Complaint nunc pro tunc as of May 3, 2022, while the second motion seeks leave to re-file his summons and cross-complaint. The court found that Galstyan did not comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, and therefore denied both motions.
