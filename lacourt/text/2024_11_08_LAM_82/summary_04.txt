And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled to grant the City of Los Angeles's motion to dismiss the petition filed by the Stanford Neighborhood Association, LLC, on behalf of nine property owners/lessees on Stanford Avenue in Los Angeles. The petition sought a writ of mandate to compel the City to enforce its order to cease concrete grinding operations at three properties on the same street, which allegedly operate unlicensed and illegal concrete grinding operations. The court found that the City's decision not to enforce its order is a matter of discretion and not a ministerial duty, and therefore the court lacks authority to issue a writ. The court also noted that the petitioner's remedy lies with those at the City who have input into enforcement decisions. The court granted the City's motion to dismiss and ordered the case dismissed with prejudice, with the parties required to meet and confer and lodge a proposed judgment forthwith.
