California ex rel. Mami Martinez v. Maki Gruninger
Case No.
20STCV39311
[Tentative] Order
Denying Motion for New Trial
 
            On January
4, 2024, the court issued a default judgment in the following amounts: 
            
            1.         Damages in the amount of $483,366.05
for the qui tam claims plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $234,399.43
for a total of $717,765.48
 
            2.         Treble damages in the amount of
$1,450,098.15 
 
            3.         A statutory penalty of $11,000 
 
            4.         Attorneys’ fees in the amount of
$44,387
 
            5.         Damages in the amount of $250,000 for
the individual claims plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $121,232.88
for a total of $371,232.88.
 
            Now,
Defendant moves for a new trial, arguing that these amounts “are excessive
since there was no specific amount identified in any of the causes of action,
as is required when a defendant has not appeared.”  Defendant is incorrect.  The first and second causes of action—which
were based on Defendant having presented false claims directly to the State of
California—each sought damages “according to proof, but not less than $400,000
as a result of her IHSS fraud.” 
(Complaint, ¶¶ 29, 35.)  The third
and fourth causes of action—which were based on Defendant having presented
false claims to contractors reimbursed by the State of California—each sought
damages “according to proof, but no less than $100,000 as a result of her
respite services fraud.”  (Complaint, ¶¶
40, 45.)  In sum, the complaint provided
notice of damages between $500,000 and $1,000,000 on the qui tam claims.  The court awarded damages below this amount,
specifically, in the amount of $483,366.06. 

 
            The
complaint provided notice that on the first, second, third, and fourth causes
of action, Plaintiff would seek “[t]riple the amount of damages sustained by
the State of California and its political subdivisions as a consequence of
Defendant’s violations of the California False Claims Act.”  (Complaint, p. 19:7-8.)  The court imposed triple damages based upon
an amount of $483,366.06, which was $1,450,098.15. 
 
            The
complaint provided notice that Plaintiff would seek civil penalties “of at
least $5,500 and a maximum of $11,000” for each of “not less than 240
violations of the California False Claims Act.” 
(Complaint, ¶¶ 30, 36, 41, 46.) 
Thus, the complaint provided notice that Plaintiff might be assessed
$2,640,000 in civil penalties.  The court
ordered one civil penalty in the amount of $11,000.
 
            Finally,
the complaint sought damages of $500,000 on each of Plaintiff’s individual
claims.  (Complaint, ¶¶ 56, 60, 65,
69.)  The court ordered Defendant to pay
$250,000 in total.  Because the judgment
was in amounts far lower than those sought by Plaintiff and noticed in the
complaint, there is no basis to set aside the judgment.  
 
            In the
alternative, Defendant argues that the default judgment was void because there
was no statement of damages.  As
authority, Defendant cites Code of Civil Procedure section 425.11(c).  However, that section applies only to
“personal injury and wrongful death actions.” 
Nor did Plaintiff seek “punitive damages” in this case.     
 
            Based upon
the foregoing, the court denies Defendant’s motion for new trial.  In the alternative, Defendant moves to set
aside the default, but the court (Richardson, J.) has already denied that
request.  (See Court’s Minute Order,
dated September 10, 2024.)  
 
            The court’s
clerk shall provide notice.
