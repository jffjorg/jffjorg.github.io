The court denies the defendant's motion for a new trial, arguing that the damages awarded were excessive. The court found that the complaint provided notice of the damages and penalties sought, and that the damages awarded were below those sought. The court also denied the defendant's alternative argument that the default judgment was void because it did not include a statement of damages. The court's ruling is based on the California False Claims Act and Code of Civil Procedure section 425.11(c).
