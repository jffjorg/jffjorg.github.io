[Tentative] Order Granting Motion for
Appeal Bond
 
INTRODUCTION  
 
            California Housing Defense Fund
(“CHDF” or “Petitioner”) filed this action on July 25, 2023, alleging that the
City of La Cañada Flintridge (the “City” or “Respondent”) violated the “Builder’s
Remedy” provision of California’s Housing Accountability Act, Government Code
section 65589.5 (the “HAA”) in connection with an application for a real estate
development project filed by Real Party in Interest 600 Foothill Owner LP (“600
Foothill” or the “Real Party”).  On April
5, 2024, after a hearing held on March 1, 2024, the court (Beckloff, J.)
granted the petition and entered judgment in favor of CHDF.  On April 11, 2024, the City filed a notice of
appeal.  On June 17, 2024, CHDF filed a
motion for appeal bond (the “bond motion”) in the amount of $14,096,952
pursuant to Government Code section 65589.5(m). 
CHDF’s bond motion states that the bond is to benefit 600 Foothill and is
supported by a declaration of Jonathan C. Curtis, a founding member of Cedar
Street Partners, LLC (“Cedar”), a real estate development firm that manages 600
Foothill.  The court grants the motion
and orders the City to post a bond in the amount of $1 million.  
 
EVIDENTIARY ISSUES 
 
            CHDF’s request for judicial notice of Exhibits A through C
is granted.
            
            The
City’s motion to strike the entire declaration of John Curtis is denied.  Curtis is not offering testimony on a
technique’s acceptance within a scientific community.  Accordingly, the City’s reliance on In re
Jordan R. (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 111, 130 is misplaced.  The court confirms that in weighing the
evidence, the court will consider that Curtis has a personal financial interest
in the matter.  While the City’s hearsay
objections are persuasive as to specific parts of the declaration, they do not
justify striking the entire declaration. 

            
            The
court overrules the City’s evidentiary objections Numbers 1 through 24, 29, 31
through 33 to the Curtis declaration.  The
City’s objections to this evidence go to the weight to be given the evidence by
the court, not the admissibility of the evidence.
 
The court sustains the City’s
evidentiary objections Numbers 25, 26, and 28, and sustains in part Number 27 (as
to all parts, except page 6, lines 14 and 17) and Number 30 (as to page 7,
lines 6-14 only).  These parts of the
Curtis declaration include inadmissible hearsay and lack sufficient foundation
and personal knowledge.  
DISCUSSION 
 
A.        The HAA’s Bond Provision
Applies to the City 
 
CDHF moves for an order requiring the City to post an appeal bond
pursuant to the HAA, which states in relevant part as follows: 
 
Upon entry of the trial
court’s order, a party may . . . appeal the judgment or order of the trial
court under Section 904.1
of the Code of Civil Procedure.  If the local agency appeals the judgment
of the trial court, the local agency shall post a
bond, in an amount to be determined by the court, to the benefit of the
plaintiff if the plaintiff is the project applicant.
 
(Gov. Code § 65589.5(m), emphasis added.)  Notwithstanding the plain language of the
HAA, the City argues that it is not required to post a bond pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 995.220, which states in relevant part: 
 
Notwithstanding any other statute, if a statute provides for a bond
in an action or proceeding, … the following public entities and officers are
not required to give the bond and shall have the same rights, remedies, and
benefits as if the bond were given:
 
…. [¶] 
 
(b) A county, city,
or district, or public authority, public agency, or other political subdivision
in the state, or an officer of the local public entity in an official capacity
or on behalf of the local public entity.
 
(Code Civ.
Proc. § 995.220, emphasis added.)  The
City argues that the phrase “notwithstanding any other law” is a term of art “that
declares the legislative intent to override all contrary law.”  (See Klajic v. Castaic Lake Water Agency (2004)
121 Cal.App.4th 5, 13.)  The City also
argues that “repeals by implication are not favored.”  (People v. Encerti (1982) 130
Cal.App.3d 791, 796-797.)
  
            The court’s interpretation of these
statutes is governed by certain principles. 
“[S]tatutes covering the same
subject matter are to be construed together and harmonized, if possible, to
maintain the integrity of both statutes.” 
(Id. at 797.)  “[C]ourts
should construe all legislative enactments to give them some meaning.”  (Rosado v. Wyman, 397 U.S. 397, 415
(1970).)  Similarly, “a statute should be
interpreted so as not to render one part inoperative.”  (Mountain States Tel. & Tel. Co. v.
Pueblo of Santa Ana, 472 U.S. 237, 249 (1985).)  Moreover, “in the event of statutory conflict, a specific
provision will control over a general provision” and “later enacted statutes
prevail over earlier enacted statutes.” 
(Bitner v. Dept. of Corrections & Rehabilitation, 87
Cal.App.5th 1048, 1060-1062 (2023).)        
 
Here, the two statutes may be harmonized such that section
65589.5(m) creates a narrow exception, for purposes of the HAA, to the general
rule in section 995.220 that a public entity may not be required to post an
appeal bond.  (See Oregon Natural
Resources Council v. Thomas, 92 F.3d 792, 797-798 (9th Cir. 1996) [recognizing
that the phrase “notwithstanding any other law” should be interpreted to
“harmonize” two subsections of a statute].) 
Further, even if there is a conflict, section 65589.5(m) prevails over section
995.220—with respect to the HAA bond requirement—as the later-enacted and more
specific statute.  The City has not cited
any legislative history that undermines the court’s interpretation of the two
statutes.  (See Sheridan Decl. ¶¶
6-8.)  To the contrary, the plain
language of the HAA manifests the Legislature’s clear intention to create an
exception to section 995.220.  Therefore,
the court finds that the HAA’s bond provision applies to the City.  
 
B.        A Bond
Is Required Even if Plaintiff Is Not the Project Applicant 
   
The City argues that CHDF is not authorized by section 65589.5(m) to
seek a bond in this action because CHDF is not the “project applicant.”  (Oppo. 9-10.) 
The HAA states in relevant part as follows: 
 
Upon entry of the trial
court’s order, a party may . . . appeal the judgment or order of the trial
court under Section 904.1
of the Code of Civil Procedure.  If the local agency appeals the judgment
of the trial court, the local agency shall post a
bond, in an amount to be determined by the court, to the benefit
of the plaintiff if the plaintiff is the project applicant.
 
(Gov. Code § 65589.5(m), emphasis added.)  
 
When interpreting a statute, “significance should be given to every
word, phrase, sentence and part of an act in pursuance of the legislative
purpose.”  (People v. McCart
(1982) 32 Cal.3d 338, 342-343.)  In this
case, the statute states that if the city appeals the judgment, the city
“shall” post a bond.  This is
unambiguous.  The statute then states,
after the comma, that the bond shall be “to the benefit of the plaintiff if the
plaintiff is the project applicant.” 
This merely relates to the identity of the beneficiary of the bond and means
that the court has no discretion as to the beneficiary when the applicant was
the plaintiff.  Conversely, when the
applicant was the real party in interest, not the plaintiff, the court has
discretion to direct the bond to the real party.  (See Save Livermore Downtown v. City of
Livermore (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 1116, 1135-1136 [affirming bond at the
request of real-party-in-interest housing developer based on statute specifying
that the “defendant” could move for a bond].)
 
The City’s contrary interpretation of the bond provision is inconsistent
with the purpose and intent of the HAA.  The HAA instructs
that “[i]t is the policy of the state that this section be interpreted and
implemented in a manner to afford the fullest possible weight to the interest
of, and the approval and provision of, housing.”  (Gov. Code § 65589.5(a)(2)(L).)  In enacting the HAA’s bond provision, the
Legislature recognized that “[a]ffordable housing developers
have found that, even if they are successful in an anti-NIMBY court action
against a local government, they often lose their projects as a result of
increases in costs, loss of permits or land, or other consequences of the
amount of time it took to get through the legal process.”  (RJN Exh. A at 2.)  A project applicant such as 600 Foothill
has the same legal interests in the HAA petition regardless of whether it is
named in the pleading as the plaintiff or a real party in interest.  (See Code Civ. Proc. § 367 and Doe
v. Regents v. University of California (2022) 80 Cal.App.5th 282, 297 [recognizing that a real party in interest is a “person who
possesses the right to sue under the substantive law.”].)  However, under the City’s construction, the
bond provision would be triggered only if the project applicant is named as the
plaintiff.  The City cites no legislative
history suggesting that the Legislature intended that arbitrary and
inconsistent result.  Accordingly, the
court find’s the City’s interpretation to be unpersuasive.
 
The City points
out that judgment has not yet been entered in the related action filed by 600
Foothill.  (Oppo. 10:8-10.)  There has been no judgment in the 600
Foothill case only because the City filed an anti-SLAPP motion in that case and
then filed an interlocutory appeal from Judge Beckloff’s order denying that
motion. (See Court’s Order, Dated November 22, 2023.)  600 Foothill has not sought a bond in that
case; the two cases are related and assigned to Department 82; and there is no
risk that any portion of the bond requested here would be duplicative.  Accordingly, the City’s reference to 600
Foothill’s action does not support denying the bond.
 
C.        The Court Bases the Amount of the Bond
on what is Certain  
 
Section 65589.5(m) does not include criteria for the court to
evaluate in its determination of the amount of the bond.  Accordingly, as the City suggests, the court
may refer to the criteria set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 917.9,
which states in pertinent part:
 
(b) The
undertaking shall be in a sum fixed by the court and shall be in an amount
sufficient to cover all damages which the respondent may sustain by reason of
the stay in the enforcement of the judgment or order.
 
[¶]
 
(d) For the purpose of this section,
“damages” means either of the following:
 
(1)  
Reasonable
compensation for the loss of use of the money or property.
 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 917.9(b), (d).)    
 
As the City argues, the losses claimed by 600 Foothill
can be divided into three categories: (1) past lost net income and expenses
totaling $8 million; (2) future lost net income of $125,000 a month; and (3) future
expenses, including construction cost increases, interest, salaries, taxes, and
cost of equity, totaling about $462,373 per month.  (See Oppo. 13-16 and Curtis Decl. ¶¶
26-28.)  
 
600 Foothill’s past lost net
income and expenses are “sunk costs” and not damages caused directly by the
City’s filing of an appeal.  600 Foothill
could also lose those “sunk costs” for reasons unrelated to the appeal,
including if it does not achieve final approval of the Project under CEQA or
other relevant law.  (See Sheridan
Decl. ¶ 5 and Judgment filed April 5, 2024.) 
For those reasons, the court does not include past lost net income and
expenses in the bond amount.
 
With respect to future lost net income
and future expenses, there is a sharp conflict in the evidence between the
Curtis declaration and the declaration of Paul C. Pocalyko, the City’s expert.[1]  The court has considered these two
declarations, the City’s motion to strike and evidentiary objections to the
Curtis declaration and CHDF’s response, and the other evidence submitted by the
parties, including excerpts from Curtis’s deposition.  
 
As
shown by the court’s rulings on evidentiary objections, important parts of the
Curtis declaration are not admissible. 
Specifically, the court sustains the City’s
evidentiary objections Numbers 25, 26, and 28 and parts of Numbers 27 and 30.  The paragraphs of the Curtis declaration challenged
in these objections include inadmissible hearsay and lack sufficient foundation
and personal knowledge.  Curtis did not
satisfy the requirements of Evidence Code section 1271 to testify about the
contents of the “confidential
and proprietary forward-looking estimate” or “pro forma” upon which he relied, which
was developed by other employees of Cedar and was not submitted as an exhibit with
Curtis’s declaration.  (See also Pocalyko
Decl., Exh. 3, Curtis Depo. at 57-59, 163, 184-185.)  Nor did Curtis provide sufficient foundation
or personal knowledge in his declaration for his estimates of increased
construction costs, other expenses (except interest on loans and rent,
utilities, taxes, and insurance), and lost net income associated with each
month of delay.  (Curtis Decl. ¶¶ 25, 27-28.)  Thus, CDHF does not meet its burden of proof
in its request for a bond in excess of $14 million.  
 
Furthermore, even if the court
overruled the objections, the court would reach the same result on this motion.  As argued persuasively by the City in
opposition, and explained in the Pocalyko declaration, there is also substantial
uncertainty as to the future losses or expenses that 600 Foothill would suffer
because of the appeal.  (See Oppo.
11-18 and Pocalyko Decl. generally.) 
Among other reasons, the judgment ordered the City to process 600
Foothill’s application pursuant to the HAA and state law, including CEQA, and
make all findings required for approval, disapproval, or conditional
disapproval.  (See Sheridan Decl.
¶ 5 and Judgment filed April 5, 2024.)  Thus,
it is unclear on this record whether 600 Foothill’s project will be approved, disapproved,
or conditionally disapproved should CHDF prevail on appeal.  At this stage, it is speculative to assign
damages for lost future income, changes in construction costs, and similar
future expenses to the appeal.  The court
also finds that the bond granted by the court for carrying costs, as discussed
below, is sufficient to protect 600 Foothill from such losses considering their
uncertain nature.   
 
Under these circumstances, the
court finds persuasive the City’s contention that the bond amount should be determined
based on 600 Foothill’s carrying costs for the pendency of the appeal.  Curtis has estimated that interest on 600
Foothill’s loans will be $17,500 per month. 
(Curtis Decl. ¶ 27.)  In a
redlined declaration submitted with his deposition, Curtis also estimated that
600 Foothill will incur rent, utilities, taxes, and insurance of $7,500 per
month during the appeal.  (Pocalyko Decl.
Exh. 11 at ¶ 27.)  The City has not
challenged that estimate for purposes of its calculation of carrying
costs.  (See Oppo. 18:6.)
Accordingly, the record supports an estimate that the appeal could cause 600
Foothill to incur interest and other expenses in the amount of $25,000 per
month.  The court estimates that the
appeal could take between 18 and 24 months to complete.  (See Mot. 8-9; Sheridan Decl. ¶ 4.)  Therefore, the court assesses this amount at
$600,000.  Curtis’s estimate of
$1,500,000 in attorney’s fees is conclusory, appears overstated, and has not
been corroborated or explained in declarations from 600 Foothill’s or CHDF’s
attorneys.  (Curtis Decl. ¶ 29.)  In the court’s experience, it would be
appropriate to estimate this amount at $400,000.  
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER 
 
            Based
upon the foregoing, the court orders as follows:
 
            1.         Plaintiff’s motion for an appeal bond pursuant to
Government Code section 65589.5(m) is granted. 

 
            2.         The
court orders the City of La Cañada Flintridge to post a bond of $1 million
within sixty (60) days or to dismiss its appeal.
 
            3.         The
court’s clerk shall provide notice.
