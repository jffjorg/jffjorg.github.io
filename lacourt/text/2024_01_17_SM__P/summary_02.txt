And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is in response to the defendants' demurrer to the complaint in a commercial unlawful detainer matter. The defendants argue that the complaint fails to allege compliance with the ordinance, and therefore, the contract claim fails. The Judge rejects this argument, stating that the breach of lease claim is not solely premised on nonpayment of rent, and that the complaint adequately alleges the required elements for breach of contract damage.

The defendants also argue that impossibility bars the claim, citing the COVID-19 pandemic and the ordinance's requirement to provide commercial tenants with notice of their rights. The Judge overrules this argument, stating that the court cannot consider affirmative defenses on demurrer, and that the complaint is not uncertain and sufficiently apprises the defendants of the allegations and issues.

In the second cause of action for breach of guaranty of lease, the defendants argue that plaintiff failed to provide notice as required under the Ordinance, and therefore, cannot enforce a personal guarantee for rent incurred by a commercial tenant during the protected time period. The Judge overrules this argument, stating that pleading compliance with the Ordinance is not a requirement for the second cause of action, and that the court cannot consider affirmative defenses on demurrer.

Overall, the Judge finds that the complaint is sufficient to state a cause of action for breach of lease and breach of guaranty, and that the defendants' demurrer is overruled.
