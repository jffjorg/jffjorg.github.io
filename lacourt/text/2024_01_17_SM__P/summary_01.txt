And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling addresses the defendant's motion for relief from waiver of objections. The dispute arose from the plaintiff's failure to timely respond to interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production. The defendant received the discovery on August 17, 2023, but thought the documents were duplicates of the summons and complaint received earlier. The defendant provided responses with objections on October 20, 2023, and further responses with objections on December 3, 2023.

The judge finds that the defendant's failure to timely respond was due to mistake, inadvertence, and/or excusable neglect, particularly given that the defendant was not yet represented by counsel when the discovery was substitute served. The court concludes that there is no prejudice to the plaintiff and grants the defendant's motion.
