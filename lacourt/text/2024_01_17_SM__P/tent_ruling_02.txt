1997, LLC v. Manifest 3, LLC, et al., Case No. 23SMCV04153
Hearing date January
17, 2024
Defendants
Manifest 3, LLC and Massa Lynda Sheridan’s Demurrer to the Complaint 
 
Defendants demur
to the breach of lease and breach of guaranty claims in this commercial
unlawful detainer matter. 
 
“A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a complaint as a matter of law.” Durell
v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358. “[T]he court gives
the complaint a reasonable interpretation, and treats the demurrer as admitting
all material facts properly pleaded.” Ibid. A demurrer accepts as true
all well pleaded facts and those facts of which the court can take judicial
notice but not deductions, contentions, or conclusions of law or fact. Fox
v. JAMDAT Mobile, Inc. (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 1068, 1078. 
 
Demurring party must meet and confer and file a declaration regarding
those efforts. Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41. Though defendants have not filed a code-compliant
meet and confer declaration (Afifi Decl., ¶¶ 2-3; Exhibits 1-2), the court will
consider the merits. 
 
Defendants request the Court take judicial
notice of Executive Order N-33-20, enacted in March 2020. Plaintiff requests
judicial notice of the January 25, 2022 Resolution of the Board of Supervisors
of the County of Los Angeles Further Amending and Restating the County of Los
Angeles COVID-19 Tenant Protections Resolution (the “ordinance”). GRANTED as to
the existence of these documents. The court does not interpret either.
 
First Cause of
Action for Breach of Office Lease  
To prevail on a
cause of action for breach of contract, plaintiff must prove (1) a contract,
(2) performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) breach and (4) damage. Richman v. Hartley (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1182,
1186. “[W]here . . . a duty alleged to be commanded by an ordinance is
sought to be enforced . . . the pleading of the ordinance is necessary.” Thompson
v. Guyer-Hays, supra, 207 Cal.App.2d 366, 373.“Where, however,
the ordinance is a mere secondary incident of the cause of action, pleading it
in the complaint . . . is not a vital prerequisite…” Id.
 
Defendants argue
the complaint fails to allege compliance with the ordinance, so the contract
claim fails. The complaint does not address the ordinance and simply alleges
breach of contract. 
 
The Court rejects defendants’ argument that because
plaintiff is suing for nonpayment of rent, compliance with the ordinance should
have been alleged. Plaintiff alleges defendant Manifest failed to pay its
pro-rata share of operating expenses and late charges, as well as rent.
Complaint, ¶¶ 14-15. The breach of the lease claim is not solely premised on
nonpayment of rent. 
 
Defendants argue impossibility bars the claim.
“Impossibility is . . . not only strict impossibility but as impracticability
because of extreme and unreasonable difficulty, expense, injury or loss
involved.” Autry v.
Republic Productions (1947) 30 Cal.2d 144, 148-49.
“[I]mpossibility and impracticability . . . are common law defenses to contract
performance.” West Pueblo Partners, LLC v. Stone Brewing Co., LLC (2023) 90 Cal.App.5th 1179, 1188. [A] demurrer
based on an affirmative defense will be sustained only where the face of the
complaint discloses that the action is necessarily barred by the defense.” Stella v. Asset Management
Consultants, Inc. (2017) 8 Cal.App.5th 181,
191. 
 
Defendants contend the ordinance required
plaintiff to provide commercial tenants with notice of their rights, and, because
of COVID-19, it was impossible for them to use the office building. This is an
affirmative defense. The court, on demurrer, cannot consider such argument and must
only consider the four corners of the complaint and allegations therein, not outside
arguments.
 
The complaint is not uncertain and sufficiently
apprises defendants of the allegations and issues. People v. Lim (1941) 18 Cal.2d 872, 882. The first cause of
action pleads the required elements for breach of contract damage. Complaint,
¶¶ 8, 10, 15-20. OVERRULED. 
 
Second Cause of
Action for Breach of Guaranty of Lease 
Defendants argue plaintiff
failed to provide notice as required under the Ordinance, so cannot enforce a
personal guarantee for rent incurred by a commercial tenant during the
protected time period. Pleading compliance with the Ordinance is not a
requirement for the second cause of action. On demurrer, the court cannot
consider affirmative defenses of lack of compliance with the Ordinance.
 
“A lender is entitled to judgment on a breach
of guaranty claim based upon undisputed evidence that (1) there is a valid
guaranty, (2) the borrower has defaulted, and (3) the guarantor failed to
perform under the guaranty. Gray1 CPB, LLC v. Kolokotronis (2011) 202 Cal.App.4th 480, 486. 
 
Plaintiff alleges existence of the guaranty.
Complaint, ¶¶ 21-26. Plaintiff states a valid cause of action for breach of
guaranty of lease under Gray 1, supra, 202 Cal.App.4th 480,
486. OVERRULED.
