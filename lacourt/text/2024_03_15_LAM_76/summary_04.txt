And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling dismissing the case with prejudice. The Plaintiff, a general contractor, alleged that the Defendant, HLW International LLP, issued an unfounded and fabricated "for cause" termination certification to the Owner of the project, allowing the Owner to terminate the contract and avoid paying additional costs associated with a "for convenience" termination.

The Court found that the Plaintiff's allegations did not plead a valid cause of action for intentional interference with contractual relations, inducing breach of contract, or unfair business practices. Specifically, the Court found that the Plaintiff did not plead a valid basis for the alleged causation, and that the Defendant did not commit an independently wrongful act.

The Court also found that the Plaintiff did not plead a valid claim for fraud, as the alleged concealment of facts was fabricated and did not cause any actual loss or damage to the Plaintiff.

Finally, the Court found that the Plaintiff did not plead a valid claim for unfair business practices under the Business and Professions Code, as the alleged injury was not economic in nature and did not affect the Plaintiff personally.

The Court denied the Plaintiff's request for leave to amend the complaint, finding that any amendments would be futile.
