[1] The court grants the
request for judicial notice filed by both parties. 
 


[2] The court acknowledges that the legislative branch is entitled to deference from
the courts because of the constitutional separation of powers, meaning courts
presume legislative is valid. (California Chamber of Commerce v. State Air
Resources Bd. (2017) 10 Cal.App.5th 604, 651-652). That said, the
separation of powers principles allows courts to interpret statutes, leaving
the legislature with the task of revising it as it deems wise. (Huff v.
Securitas Security Services USA, Inc. (2018) 23 Cal.App.5th 745.) 
 


[3] As of October 10, 2023, AB 452 was
passed, which all together eliminates the statute of limitations (SOL)
for sexual assault cases arising after January 1, 2024. The motion, however, is
based upon AB 218. Therefore, any citations to CCP section 340.1 will be as to
the 2020 amendment (not 2023 amendment). 
 


[4] The opposition
largely raises Plaintiff’s own arguments and law without addressing many
of Defendant’s citations and points. The opposition is solely dedicated to the
public purpose exception, infra. (See Opp. p. 2, header ‘B. The
Retroactive Elimination of Claims Presentation Requirements in AB 218 Is
Constitutional; It Does Not Violate Gift Clause of California Constitution
Because It Has a Clear and Established Public Purpose’].) 
 


[5] Purposes which
Defendant does not otherwise dispute in Reply.
 


[6] For this reason,
Defendant in Reply avers that because Coats did not address the
constitutional issue raised in this case, it has no bearing on the issue at
hand. (Reply p. 3, citing Agnew v. State Bd. of Equalization (1999) 21
Cal.4th 310, 332 [“[i]t is axiomatic … that a decision does not stand for a
proposition not considered by the court.”].) While Coats is inapposite,
the court does note, out of fairness, that plenty of Defendant’s citations then
also have no bearing on the case because they did not address the Gifts Clause
in relation to the claims presentation requirement. (See e.g., Motion p. 12
citing to Powell v. Phelan (1903) 138 Cal. 27 [because the juror had no
legal entitlement to the payment at time the juror served jury duty, the law
allowing payment for attendance was unconstitutional]; see also Reply p. 6,
citing Perez v. Roe 1 (2006) 146 Cal.App.4th 171 [dealt with statute of
limitations, not claim presentation].)
