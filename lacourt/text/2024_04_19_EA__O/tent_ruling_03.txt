Background
 
This case
arises from the dog bite of a minor. 
 
On March 13,
2023, Plaintiff Lidia Gonzalez as Guardian Ad Litem for Ronny Gonzalez filed
suit against Defendants Manuel Castro, Maria Rosario Castro, Lucia Melo for (1)
general negligence and (2) premises liability.
 
On August 29, 2023, default was entered against
Lucia Melo and Maria Rosario Castro. 
 
On September
13, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a POS as to Estate of Manuel Castro, sued herein as
DOE 1.[1]
 
On September
14, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a notice of lis pendens.
 
On October
19, 2023, the court issued the following minute order during the CMC hearing:
“The Court informs the Defendant, Maria Rosario Castro, that she is currently
in Default Status. On the Court’s own motion pursuant to CCP §403.040(a), the
matter is set for a Walker Hearing as to whether the matter should be
reclassified as a limited jurisdiction case under Walker v. Superior Court
(1991) 53 Cal.3d 257. The parties are ordered to file briefs nine (9) calendar
days before the scheduled hearing. If a party so desires, it may file a reply
brief five (5) calendar days before the scheduled hearing.”
 
On November
6, 2023, default was entered as to the estate. 
 
On December
5, 2023, the court issued, in pertinent part, the following minute order re:  Hearing on Motion to Reclassify (Walker
Motion); Status Conference Re: Representation of Defendant, Maria Rosario
Castro; Case Management Conference: “The Defendant's oral motion for a
continuance to hire Private Counsel is heard and GRANTED.” Based thereon, the
court continued the hearing on the motion to reclassify (Walker motion) and “In
light of the above and by Order of the Court, the matter is reserved for
February 15, 2024, at the Pomona Courthouse in Department O at 10:00 a.m. for a
Hearing on Motion to Set Aside Default and Default Judgment.”
 
On January
10, 2024, the court stated, in pertinent part, the following during the Case
Management Conference; Hearing on Motion to Reclassify (Walker Motion); Status
Conference Re: Representation of Defendant, Maria Rosario Castro: “Plaintiff's
Counsel and the Defendant stipulate to vacate the Default as to Defendant Maria
Rosario Castro ONLY. Pursuant to the stipulation, the Defendant is to file an
answer ONLY. The Court orders the default entered on 08/24/2023 as to Maria
Rosario Castro vacated. The Defendant is given 30 days to Answer only. The
Defendant is ordered to file an Answer due on or before February 9, 2024. The
Defaults as to Defendants Lucia Melo and the Estate of Manuel Castro are to
remain.” That same day, Plaintiff filed an application for entry of default
judgment against Lucia. 
 
On February
5, 2024, Maria filed her answer.[2]

 
On April 9,
2024, Plaintiff filed a brief in opposition to the court’s motion pursuant to
CCP 403.040(A) to reclassify case to limited jurisdiction. 
I.               
Discussion Re:
Reclassification  
According to CCP section 403.040, a court, “on its
own motion, may reclassify a case at any time.” The court must give notice and
allow the parties an opportunity to contest the reclassification. (Stern v.
Superior Court (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 223, 229-231.)
As for the requirements of reclassification from
an unlimited to a limited case, trial court must find that the matter will
necessarily result in a verdict below the jurisdictional amount required by
statute for classification as an unlimited civil case. (Hiona v. Superior
Court (2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 866, 872.) “Necessarily” means that there is “a
high level of certainty that a damage award will not exceed $25,000.” (Walker
v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 257, 268-270.) Finding that a judgment
that exceeds $25,000 is merely “unlikely” or “not reasonably probable” is not
sufficient to support reclassification of the case as a limited civil case. (Hiona,
supra, 48 Cal.App.5th at p. 872.) In sum, in making the determination to
reclassify, legal certainty is required. (Chahal v. Superior Court
(1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 399, 402-403.)
Here, In Plaintiff’s amended brief, the damages
are as follows: $2,802.00 in medical costs, $8,000 for a possible
surgery, and future medicals in an undetermined amount. As to the latter, the
minor has been scheduled for a Neurocognitive Rehabilitation Evaluation and for
a PTSD Evaluation based on the minor’s new fear of dogs. 
Thus, even if any amount regarding future medicals
and purported emotional distress is “unlikely” or “not reasonably probable” to
exceed the jurisdictional mount of $35,000.01, is not sufficient to support
reclassification of the case as a limited civil case.
II.             
Discussion Re:
Default Judgment 
Plaintiff seeks entry of default judgment against Court
enter Judgement in his favor and against Defendant, MARIA and Lucia.
 
However, any request for default judgment as to Maria is
not ripe as her default was vacated and she timely filed her answer. 
 
As to Lucia, Plaintiff seeks General Damages of $35,000.00,
Special Damages of $4,302.00 and Costs of $ 1,957.71. The court directs
Plaintiff to Code of Civil Procedure section 585. One of the requirements is
a dismissal of all parties
against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment
under CCP § 579, supported
by a showing of grounds for each judgment. Here, the estate and Maria are still
named Defendants to the action and no showing has been provided that a separate
judgment as to Lucia should be awarded.  
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, the case appropriately falls within the unlimited jurisdictional
amount. The application for entry of default judgment as to Lucia is DENIED
without prejudice and the application for entry of default judgment as to Maria
is DENIED in that it is improper.
