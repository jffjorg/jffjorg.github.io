And here is the English text summary of the Tentative Ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in this case, addressing two main issues: the motion to reclassify the case from unlimited to limited jurisdiction and the application for entry of default judgment against Lucia Melo and Maria Rosario Castro.

Regarding the motion to reclassify, the court finds that the damages claimed by the plaintiff are not "necessarily" below the jurisdictional amount of $25,000, as required by law. Therefore, the motion is denied.

Regarding the application for entry of default judgment, the court finds that the plaintiff has not provided sufficient grounds for judgment against Lucia Melo and Maria Rosario Castro, and therefore the application is denied without prejudice.
