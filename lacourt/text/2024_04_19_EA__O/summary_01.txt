Case Number: 22STCV08077
Case Title: John Doe v. Bonita Unified School District

Parties:
  - Plaintiff: Steven Ojeda
  - Defendant: Bonita Unified School District

Background:
  - Plaintiff alleges sexual abuse by a teacher at the school in approximately 1977
  - Plaintiff reported the abuse to the vice principal, but no action was taken

Causes of Action:
  - Negligence (DOE 1 SCHOOL)
  - Negligence (DOES 2 through 25)
  - Negligent Hiring, Retention, and Supervision (DOE 1 SCHOOL)
  - Negligent Hiring, Retention, and Supervision (DOES 2 through 25)

Legal Standard:
  - Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is similar to a general demurrer
  - Court must liberally construe allegations of the complaint
  - Leave to amend should be granted if there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action

Discussion:
  - Plaintiff's failure to comply with a timely claim presentation would otherwise create liability for a past act of negligence when none existed
  - Government Code section 905 provides that a written claim must be timely presented to the defendant and rejected in whole or in part
  - Timely claim presentation is a substantive element of the claim

Ruling:
  - The motion for judgment on the pleadings is GRANTED without leave to amend
  - The court finds that the Legislature has overstepped its constitutional authority by imposing liability on public entities for past conduct where no enforceable claim existed
  - The court concludes that AB 218 is unconstitutional because it creates a liability where one did not previously exist, and therefore is a gift of public funds

Significant Statements:
  - "The Legislature has no power to create a liability against the state for any past act of negligence." (Chapman v. State)
  - "Doing otherwise would, in effect, be the making of a gift." (Heron v. Riley)
  - "All appropriations of public money for which there is no authority or enforceable claim are unconstitutional." (Conlin v. Board of Supervisors)

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, without leave to amend. The court finds that the Legislature's attempt to impose liability on public entities for past conduct where no enforceable claim existed is unconstitutional. The court concludes that Assembly Bill 218, which revived all claims of childhood sexual abuse not previously litigated to finality for a 3-year period, is unconstitutional because it creates a liability where one did not previously exist. The court finds that the Legislature has overstepped its constitutional authority and that the bill is a gift of public funds.
