And here is the English-text summary:

The court grants the request for judicial notice filed by both parties. The court acknowledges that the legislative branch is entitled to deference from the courts due to the constitutional separation of powers, which means courts presume legislative acts are valid. However, the court also has the authority to interpret statutes, leaving the legislature with the task of revising them as it deems wise. The court notes that AB 452 was passed, which eliminates the statute of limitations for sexual assault cases arising after January 1, 2024. The court addresses the opposition's arguments, noting that the opposition largely raises the plaintiff's own arguments and law without addressing many of the defendant's citations and points. The court also notes that the defendant's reply avers that because Coats did not address the constitutional issue raised in this case, it has no bearing on the issue at hand. The court concludes that the defendant's citations have no bearing on the case because they did not address the Gift Clause in relation to the claims presentation requirement.
