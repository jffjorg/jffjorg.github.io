DEFENDANT
BONITA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT’S (ERRONEOUSLY SUED AS LOS ANGELES UNIFIED
SCHOOL DISTRICT) NOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS is GRANTED.
As for leave to amend, as the complaint fails as a matter of law (and not

Background
 
This case
arises from the alleged sexual assault of a minor. Plaintiff STEVEN OJEDA
alleges the following against Defendant Doe 1 School: In approximately 1977,
when he was approximately ten (10) years of age, Plaintiff was sexually abused
and assaulted on a regular basis for approximately one year by a teacher on
premises of the school. The acts of sexual abuse included but “fondling
Plaintiff's genitals, forcing Plaintiff to masturbate [the teacher], and forced
oral copulation.” (First Amended Complaint (FAC) p. 5.) Plaintiff reported the
sexual abuse to the vice principal, but no action was taken. 
 
On March 4,
2022, Plaintiff filed suit alleging the following causes of action (COAs): 1.     Negligence (DOE 1 SCHOOL) 2.     Negligence (DOES 2 through 25) 3.     Negligent Hiring, Retention, and
Supervision (DOE 1 SCHOOL) 4.     Negligent Hiring, Retention, and
Supervision (DOES 2 through 25)
 
On May 3,
2022, Plaintiff filed a FAC naming Los Angeles Unified School District as the
Doe 1 School. 
 
On July 26,
2022, Plaintiff filed an ‘Amendment to Complaint’ replacing Los Angeles Unified
School District with Bonita Unified School District (“Defendant” or the
“District”). 
 
On October
20, 2022, Defendant filed its answer. 
 
On October
16, 2023, Defendant filed the instant motion for judgment on the pleadings
(MJOP).
 
On October 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed his opposition.  
 
On November
2, 2023, Defendant filed its reply.
 
On February
15, 2024, the court conducted a status conference and noted the following: “The
Court states it has read and considered the Minute Order dated November 9,
2023, indicating the matter is transferred to Department O for all purposes
except trial.”
 
Legal
Standard
 
It is well established in California
that either prior to trial or at the trial the plaintiff or the defendant may
move for judgment on the pleadings and that the appropriate ground for such a
motion is the same as that arguable by general demurrer, namely, the failure to
state a cause of action or defense.  (Dobbins v. Hardister (1966)
242 Cal.App.2d 787, 791; see also Sofias v. Bank of America (1985)
172 Cal.App.3d 583, 586 [The non statutory motion for judgment on the
pleadings can be made at any time, even during trial, since the grounds for a
general demurrer are never waived.]; Code Civ. Proc., § 438.) 
 
A motion for judgment on the pleadings
performs the same function as a general demurrer, and hence attacks only
defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings or by matters that can
be judicially noticed. (Lance Camper Manufacturing Corp. v. Republic
Indemnity Co. (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 194, 198.) Presentation of
extrinsic evidence is therefore not proper on a motion for judgment on the
pleadings. (Id.; Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998)
67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999.) Both a demurrer and a motion for judgment on the
pleadings accept as true all material factual allegations of the challenged
pleading, unless contrary to law or to facts of which a court may take judicial
notice.[1] 
(Mechanical Contractors Assn. v. Greater Bay Area Assn. (1998) 66
Cal.App.4th 672, 677; Edwards v. Centex Real Estate Corp, (1997) 53
Cal.App.4th 15, 27.)  On a motion for judgment on the pleadings a court
may take judicial notice of something that cannot reasonably be controverted,
even if it negates an express allegation of the pleading.  (See Columbia
Casualty Co. v. Northwestern Nat. Ins. Co. (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 457,
468-469; Evans v. California Trailer Court, Inc. (1994) 28
Cal.App.4th 540, 549.) 
 
“Matters which are subject to mandatory judicial notice may be treated
as part of the complaint and may be considered without notice to the
parties.¿¿[Citation.]¿¿Matters which are subject to permissive judicial notice
must be specified in the notice of motion, the supporting points and
authorities, or as the court otherwise permits.”¿ (Schabarum¿v. California
Legislature¿(1998)¿60 Cal.App.4th¿1205, 1216, fn. 5.)¿¿“Judgment on the
pleadings does¿not depend upon a resolution of questions of witness credibility
or¿evidentiary conflicts.¿¿In fact, judgment on the pleadings must be denied
where there are material factual issues that require evidentiary
resolution.”¿¿(Id.¿at¿1216.)¿ In ruling on a [motion for a judgment on
the pleadings], the court must “liberally construe[]” the allegations of the
complaint. ¿(Code Civ. Proc., § 452.)  “This rule of liberal construction
means that the reviewing court draws inferences favorable to the
plaintiff, not the defendant.” ¿(Perez v. Golden Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209
Cal.App.4th 1228, 1238.) 
 
Leave to amend should be granted
if there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good
cause of action.  (Virginia G. v. ABC Unified School Dist. (1993)
15 Cal.App.4th 1848, 1852.)  
 
Discussion[2]
 
In 2019, the
California Legislature passed Assembly Bill 218 (“AB 218”), which took effect
January 1, 2020, and made several significant changes to Code of Civil
Procedure section 340.1 (“CCP § 340.1”)—the statute of limitations for claims
of childhood sexual abuse.[3]
Among other things, the law revives all claims of childhood sexual abuse not
previously litigated to finality for a 3-year period; it extends the SOL for
such claims to 22 years after the age of majority (or age 40); it authorizes
treble damages for “cover ups”; and it retroactively eliminates the protection
previously afforded to public school districts by Government Code section 905,
subdivision (m), which provided a bright-line rule that public entities could
not be held liable for abuse claims arising from conduct occurring prior to
January 1, 2009. 
 
The crux of
the District’s argument is that AB 218’s imposition of liability on public
entities for past conduct where no enforceable claim existed (for failure to
comply with claims presentation requirements) is unconstitutional because it
violates Article XVI, section 6 of the California Constitution (“Gift Clause”).
The constitutional provision provides that “[t]he Legislature shall have no
power to give or to lend, or to authorize the giving or lending … in any manner
whatever, for the payment of liabilities of any individual, association,
municipal or other corporation whatever; nor shall it have power to make any
gift or authorize the making of any gift, of any public money….” (Cal. Const.
Art. XVI, sec. 6.)
 
The term ‘gift’ in the constitutional provision ‘includes
all appropriations of public money for which there is no authority or
enforceable claim,’ even if there is a moral or equitable obligation.” (Jordan
v. Department of Motor Vehicles (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 431, 450 [quoting Conlin
v. Board of Supervisors (1893) 99 Cal. 17, 21-22].) Interpreting this constitutional provision, the
California Supreme Court has stated that “the legislature has no power to
create a liability against the state for any [ ] past act of negligence.”
(Motion p. 7, quoting Chapman v. State (1894) 104 Cal. 690, 693.) Doing otherwise “would, in
effect, be the making of a gift.” (Motion p. 7, quoting Heron v.
Riley (1930) 209 Cal. 507, 517.) 
 
Here, Plaintiff’s failure to
comply with a timely claim presentation would otherwise create liability
for a past act of negligence when none existed because the claims presentation
requirement is a substantive element of the COA against the District. Government Code
section 905 provides that, aside from some exceptions, an action for money or
damages may not be maintained against a public entity unless a written claim
has first been timely presented to the defendant and rejected in whole or in
part. Government Code section 945.4 reinforces that such suits are prohibited
absent compliance with a timely claim presentation, which is to be filed not
later than six months after the accrual of the cause of action. (Gov. Code §
911.2 (a).) And case law is clear that timely claim presentation is not merely
a procedural hurdle akin to a statute of limitations but is considered a substantive
element of the claim. (Motion p. 10, citing Shirk v. Vista Unified School
District (2007) 42 Cal.4th 201, 209 [“Complaints that do not allege facts demonstrating either that a
claim was timely presented or that compliance with the claims statute is
excused are subject to a general demurrer for not stating facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action.”]; see also Motion p. 10, citing Rubenstein
v. Doe No. 1 (2017) 3 Cal.5th 903, 906 [“Compliance
with the claim requirement is a
condition precedent to suing the public entity.”], emphasis added.)

 
Accordingly, prior to AB 218, Plaintiff’s failure to file a timely claim
presentation—again, a substantive element of the claim—would result in no
valid claim against the District. (Motion p. 18, citing Hom v. Chico
Unified Sch. Dist. (1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 335, 339 [court does not have
jurisdiction over a matter wherein the plaintiff fails to make a timely claim
presentation].) 
 
To the extent that there is
alternative argument, the foregoing, though extensively briefed by Defendant,
is NOT addressed Plaintiff.[4]
 
Therefore, based on the foregoing binding authority, it appears
that the Legislature has indeed overstepped its constitutional authority when
it attempted to impose liability on public entities for past conduct where no
enforceable claim existed, which runs afoul of the Gift Clause. 
 
Notwithstanding,
both parties acknowledge that if public funds are used for a public
purpose, they are not a gift within the meaning of the Gift Clause. (See Motion p. 14, citing Jordan,
supra, 100 Cal.App.4th at p. 450; Opp. p. 7, citing Scott v. State Bd.
of Equalization (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1597.) 
 
“The
determination of what constitutes a public purpose is primarily a matter for
the Legislature to determine and its discretion will not be disturbed by the
courts so long as that determination has a reasonable basis.” (Opp. p. 4,
quoting County of Alameda v. Carleson (1971) 5 Cal.2d 73, 746, citing County
of Alameda v. Janssen (1940) 16 Cal.2d 276.) That said, an appropriation
for an unenforceable claim serves no public purpose.” (Motion p.
14:18-20; see Conlin, supra, 99 Cal.17 at pp. 21-22 [“all appropriations
of public money for which there is no authority or enforceable claim” are
unconstitutional regardless of whether “a sufficient motive appears for its
appropriation.”].) Put
plainly, if the claim is unenforceable, there is no public purpose as a matter
of law. (Motion p. 15, citing Jordan, supra, 100 Cal.App.4th at
450 [appropriation beyond the public entity’s “maximum exposure” serves no
public purpose and is a gift of public funds as a matter of law]; see also (Motion
p. 15, citing Orange County Foundation v. Irvine Co. (1983) 139
Cal.App.3d 195, 200 [“[W[hen state funds are expended pursuant to a settlement
agreement in exchange for the relinquishment of such a claim, no ‘public
purpose’ is achieved. Such an expenditure violates the gift clause.”].) 
 
Accordingly, even
if the public purpose of AB 218 is to ensure that the “victims severely
damaged by childhood sexual abuse are able to seek compensation from those
responsible” (Opp. p. 4, quoting Coats v. New Haven Unified School Dist.
(2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 415, 422) and to “increas[e] the availability of the
courts for victims of child sexual abuse” (Opp. p. 4:25-26),[5]
that is inapposite.[6]

 
In sum, the
Legislature by enactment of AB 218 created a liability where one did not
previously exist because the claim presentation requirement is a substantive
element of a claim. And when the Legislature creates a liability where one did
not previously exist, whether the enactment was for a public purpose is
irrelevant because all appropriations of public money for which there is no
statutory or enforceable claim are unconstitutional. (Conlin, supra, 99
Cal.17 at pp. 21-22.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, though the court is sympathetic to Plaintiff’s trauma caused by the
perpetrator/teacher and the court is cognizant that the Legislature has the
right to excuse claim presentation prospectively, doing so retroactively
and consequently creating liability when none existed appears to be
unconstitutional. Therefore, the motion is GRANTED without leave to
amend.
