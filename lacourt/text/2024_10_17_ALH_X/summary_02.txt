```

And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied Defendant American Honda Motor Co.'s motion for summary adjudication of the third cause of action, which alleges fraudulent inducement - concealment. The Judge found that Plaintiff has presented evidence that Defendant was aware of the defects in the vehicle and concealed them from the Plaintiff. The Judge also found that the Plaintiff relied on Defendant's information and brought the vehicle in for repairs multiple times. The Judge concluded that the Plaintiff has established a triable issue of fact as to whether the Plaintiff incurred any damage as a result of the defect in the vehicle. Additionally, the Judge found that the economic loss doctrine does not bar the Plaintiff's claim, as the Plaintiff's claim alleges presale conduct by Honda that is distinct from Honda's alleged subsequent conduct in breaching its warranty obligations.
