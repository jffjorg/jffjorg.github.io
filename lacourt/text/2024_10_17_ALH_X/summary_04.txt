And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the Defendant to the Plaintiff's complaint. The Plaintiff, David Kato, alleges that the Defendant's foreclosure of his property was wrongful and violates various California laws, including the Homeowner Bill of Rights (HBOR).

The Judge has found that the Plaintiff lacks standing to assert HBOR claims because the property was not owner-occupied and the loan was commercial. The Judge has also deemed the Plaintiff to be a borrower because of his designation as a “Borrower” in the Deed of Trust.

The Judge has sustained the demurrer to the first cause of action, which alleges violations of Civil Code section 2923.5, because the Plaintiff lacks standing to assert HBOR claims. The Judge has also sustained the demurrer to the second cause of action, which alleges violations of Civil Code section 2924(a)(1), because the Plaintiff failed to plead facts sufficient to show an illegal, fraudulent, or willfully oppressive sale.

The Judge has overruled the demurrer to the third cause of action, which alleges violations of Civil Code section 2924.9, because the Plaintiff has adequately pled a violation of this code section.

The Judge has sustained the demurrer to the fourth cause of action, which alleges wrongful foreclosure, because the Plaintiff failed to plead facts sufficient to show an illegal, fraudulent, or willfully oppressive sale.

The Judge has sustained the demurrer to the fifth cause of action, which alleges violations of California Business and Professions Code section 17200 et seq., because the Plaintiff lacks standing to maintain a UCL claim based on the alleged unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent business acts.

The Judge has sustained the demurrer to the sixth cause of action, which seeks cancellation of the recorded Notice of Default, Notice of Trustee's Sale, and Trustee's Deed Upon Sale, because the Plaintiff failed to plead facts sufficient to show the apparent validity of the instruments designated and the reason for asserting that they are actually invalid.

The Judge has given the Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to plead additional facts and allegations to support the causes of action that were sustained.
