Analysis
 
Attorney Fees Under Civil Code Section 5975,
Subdivision (c)
 
“The Davis-Stirling
Act governs an action to enforce the recorded covenants and restrictions of a
common interest development.  Civil Code
section 5975 provides that the CC&Rs may be enforced as equitable
servitudes and that in an action to enforce the governing documents, the
prevailing party shall be awarded reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.”  (Almanor Lakeside Villas Owners Assn. v.
Carson (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 761, 773; Civ. Code, § 5975, subd. (c).)
 
“The Davis-Stirling
Act does not define ‘prevailing party’ or provide a rubric for that
determination.”  (Ibid.)  Rather, California courts have found that the
test for prevailing party is “a pragmatic one, namely whether a party prevailed
on a practical level by achieving its main litigation objectives.”  (Ibid.)
 
Civil Code section
5975 provides: “In an action to enforce the governing documents, the prevailing
party shall be awarded reasonable attorney fees and costs.”  Plaintiff prevailed at trial and was deemed
the prevailing party.  Thus, Plaintiff is
entitled to an award of attorney fees and costs.  Attorney fees under Civil Code section 5975
are appropriate.
 
Reasonableness of Attorney Fees Sought
“The determination
of what constitutes a reasonable fee generally “begins with the ‘lodestar,’
i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the hourly rate.”  (Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc.
(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.)
 
“The reasonable
hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar work.”  (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22
Cal.4th 1084, 1095.)  “The experienced
trial judge is the best judge of value of professional services rendered in his
court.”  (Ibid.)  An award of attorney fees may also be based on
counsel’s declarations.  (Raining v.
Data Corp. v. Barrenechea (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1363, 1375.)  The court finds Defendant’s counsel’s hourly
rates reasonable.
 
The attorney bears
the burden of proof as to reasonableness of any fee claim.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(c)(5).)  This burden requires competent evidence as to
the nature and value of the services rendered.  (Martino v. Denevi (1986) 182
Cal.App.3d 553, 559.)  “In challenging
attorney fees as excessive because too many hours of work are claimed, it is
the burden of the challenging party to point to the specific items challenged,
with a sufficient argument and citations to the evidence.  General arguments that fees claimed are
excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice.”  (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230
Cal.App.4th 459, 488, quoting Premier Med. Mgmt. Sys., Inc. v. California
Ins. Guarantee Assn. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.) 
 
Plaintiff has
substantiated its attorney fees request with the billing records of work
performed.  (Moreno Decl., ¶ 8; Exh. 1.)  Plaintiff is claiming $28,336.00 in attorney
fees so far, plus an anticipated $1,925.00 for 5 hours of work at $385 per hour
in connection with reviewing the opposition, preparing a reply, and appearing
at the hearing. 
 
No opposition was
filed, so the Court only awards 1 hour of anticipated work at $385 for
attending the hearing of this motion.  The
Court will award the requested $28,336.00 in attorney’s fees plus $385 for
attending the hearing. 
 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s
motion and awards $28,721.00 in attorney’s fees.
