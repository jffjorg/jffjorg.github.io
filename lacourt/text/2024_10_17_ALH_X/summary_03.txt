And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for attorney fees filed by the plaintiff. The plaintiff is seeking an award of $28,336.00 in attorney fees, plus an additional $1,925.00 for anticipated work. The judge finds that the plaintiff is entitled to recover attorney fees under Civil Code Section 5975, which provides that the prevailing party in an action to enforce the governing documents of a common interest development shall be awarded reasonable attorney fees and costs. The judge determines that the plaintiff prevailed at trial and is therefore the prevailing party. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's request for attorney fees is reasonable and awards $28,721.00 in attorney fees, including $385.00 for attending the hearing on the motion.
