And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to garnish the wages of the defendant's spouse, Heather Wilson. The plaintiff has been unsuccessful in collecting on the judgment against the defendant, Karim Hamza, and seeks to garnish Wilson's wages as community property. The judge has found that the debt was incurred during the time Hamza and Wilson were married, making it a community debt. The judge has also found that the wage garnishment law provides the exclusive procedure for executing against the wages of a judgment debtor, except for cases of judgments or orders for support. Therefore, the judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to garnish Wilson's wages.
