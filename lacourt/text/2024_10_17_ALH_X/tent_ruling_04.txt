 Case Number:  23AHCV02482    Hearing Date:   October 17, 2024    Dept:  X DEMURRER
TO COMPLAINT
Defendants demur to the entire complaint, the latter of which alleges various violations related to the
foreclosure of a property. 
 
The
demurrer is OVERRULED as to the third cause of action and SUSTAINED with leave
to amend as to the first, second, fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action.
Plaintiff is to file an amended Complaint within 20 days of mailing of a notice of ruling.
Factual Allegations
Kato obtained a
mortgage loan on the subject property from JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. on July
15, 2016 for $477,367, with a maturity date of August 1, 2046. 
 
The deed of trust
was subsequently assigned three times: from JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. to
Bayview Loan Servicing, LLC on August 5, 2020, from Bayview Loan Servicing, LLC
to Nationstar Mortgage, LLC on August 16, 2022, and from Nationstar Mortgage,
LLC to VMRTG DEFENDANT on March 22, 2023.
 
On May 30, 2023, a
notice of default and election to sell under the deed of trust was recorded,
and on August 30, 2023, a notice of trustee’s sale was recorded, with the sale
date set for October 5, 2023.  The
subject property was Kato’s additional property, which he had intended to use
as a senior assisted living home, but after his wife’s passing, he decided to
rent it out.
 
Kato alleges that he
did not receive any notices regarding the foreclosure, and was unaware that the
loan had been transferred multiple times, still believing it was owned by JP
Morgan Chase.
 
The Complaint alleges eight causes of action: violations of
Civil Code Sections (1) 2923.5; (2) 2924(a)(1); (3) 2924.9; (4) wrongful
foreclosure; (5) violation of Business and Professions Code 17200 et seq.; and (6)
violation of Civil Code Section 3412. 
 
Request for Judicial Notice
Defendant’s
unopposed request for judicial notice is GRANTED as to all exhibits, Exhs. A to
I. (Evid. Code §§ 452, 453.) The Court will take judicial notice of the
recorded property documents and accepts the fact of their existence, but not
the truth of their contents. (See Herrera v. Deutsche Bank Nat'l Trust Co.
(2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1366, 137.)
 
Legal Analysis
“The function of a demurrer is to test the sufficiency of
the complaint as a matter of law.”  (Holiday
Matinee, Inc. v. Rambus, Inc. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 1413, 1420.)  A complaint “is sufficient if it alleges
ultimate rather than evidentiary facts” (Doe v. City of Los Angeles
(2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550 (“Doe”)), but the plaintiff must set forth the
essential facts of his or her case “with reasonable precision and with
particularity sufficient to acquaint [the] defendant with the nature, source
and extent” of the plaintiff’s claim.  (Doheny
Park Terrace Homeowners Assn., Inc. v. Truck Ins. Exchange (2005) 132
Cal.App.4th 1076, 1099.) 
 
Legal conclusions are insufficient.  (Id., at pp. 1098–99.)  The Court “assume[s] the truth of the
allegations in the complaint, but do[es] not assume the truth of contentions,
deductions, or conclusions of law.”  (California
Logistics, Inc. v. State of California (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 242, 247.)  A demurrer lies only for defects appearing on
the face of the complaint or from matters of which the court must or may take
judicial notice.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.40; see Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)
 
1.    
Civil Code § 2923.5
 
Civil Code section 2923.5 provides, in relevant part: 
A mortgage servicer, mortgagee,
trustee, beneficiary, or authorized agent shall not record a notice of default
pursuant to Section 2924 until both of the following: 
 
(A) Either 30 days after initial
contact is made as required by paragraph (2) or 30 days after satisfying the
due diligence requirements as described in subdivision (e). 
(B) The mortgage servicer complies
with paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 2924.18, if the borrower has
provided a complete application as defined in subdivision (d) of Section
2924.18. 
 
With regards to the “contact” required by (A) above, the
mortgage servicer “shall contact the borrower in person or by telephone in
order to assess the borrower’s financial situation and explore options for the
borrower to avoid foreclosure.”  (Civ.
Code § 2923.5(a)(2).) 
 
“By its terms, section 2923.5 operates substantively on
lenders.  They must do things in order to
comply with the law.”  (Mabry v.
Superior Court (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 208, 222.)  However, even though the law requires the
mortgage servicer to do certain things, if those actions are not taken, the
borrower’s remedy is extremely limited.  Under
the plain language of section 2923.5, “the only remedy provided is a
postponement of the [foreclosure] sale before it happens.” (Id. at 235.) 
 
Here, the Complaint alleges Defendants failed to comply with
the requirements of section 2923.5(a)(2) before recording a Notice of Default
on the plaintiff's property on May 30, 2023.  Specifically, Plaintiff claims that Defendants
failed to advise him in writing within 30 days that his Deed of Trust had been
transferred or assigned to a third party, as required by 15 U.S.C. § 1641(g).  Plaintiff also alleges that Defendants failed
to contact him in person or by telephone to assess his financial situation and
explore options to avoid foreclosure, and failed to schedule a subsequent
meeting within 14 days as mandated by section 2923.5(a)(2), before recording
the Notice of Default.
 
Defendants contend that Plaintiff lacks standing to invoke
any statutory rights or protections under the Homeowner Bill of Rights (“HBOR”)
because such protections apply only to first lien mortgages and deeds of trust
against “owner-occupied residential real property”  (Dem., pp. 8-9 (citing Civ. Code, §
2924.15(a)(1)(A)).)  For these purposes,
‘owner-occupied’ means that the property is the principal residence of the
borrower and is security for a loan made for personal, family, or household
purposes.”  (Civ. Code, § 2924.15(a)(1)(B).)
 Defendants assert Plaintiff is not the
“borrower” for the purposes of HBOR, and thus lacks standing to assert HBOR
claims. 
 
Section 2920.5 subsection (c)(1) defines “borrower” as “any
natural person who is a mortgagor or trustor and who is potentially eligible
for any federal, state, or proprietary foreclosure prevention alternative
program offered by, or through, his or her mortgage servicer.”  (Civ. Code, § 2920.5(c)(1).)
 
The Court notes that page 2 of RJN, Exhibit A (the Deed of
Trust recorded on July 15, 2016), lists under “Definitions” that “Borrower” is
David Kato and Tamara Kato.  (RJN, Exh.
A.)  Thus, it appears to the Court that
Plaintiff David Kato was a borrower.
 
However, the demurrer makes a strong argument regarding the
purposes of the loan that Plaintiff obtained.  In the complaint, Plaintiff admits, “PLAINTIFF’s
intentions were to make this a senior assisted living home to help care for
about 10 seniors that needed to have stability in their living situation” and
“PLAINTIFF did not reside at this address.”  (Compl., ¶¶ 16-17.)  Plaintiff’s admission demonstrates that this
property was not owner-occupied and that the loan was commercial and not made
for “personal, family, or household purposes.”  As such, Plaintiff lacks standing to assert
HBOR claims.  The demurrer to the first
cause of action is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
 
2.    
Civil Code § 2924(a)(1)
 
As a preliminary matter, the “owner-occupied residential
real property” requirement under Civil Code section 2924.15 does not expressly
apply to Civil Code section 2924.9. 
 
The cause of action for violation of Civil Code section
2924(a)(1) relies entirely on the assertion that no Substitution of Trustee was
recorded with the Los Angeles County Recorder office which renders the Notice
of Default and Notice of Trustee’s Sale void. 
 
Civil Code section 2924(a)(1) provides: “The trustee,
mortgagee, or beneficiary, or any of their authorized agents shall first file
for record, in the office of the recorder of each county wherein the mortgaged
or trust property or some part or parcel thereof is situated, a notice of
default.”
 
The Court notes that RJN, Exhibit F is a Substitution of
Trustee recorded on May 15, 2023, in the official records of Los Angeles County
as Document Number 20230315043.
 
Therefore, without other points or arguments regarding a
violation of section 2924(a)(1), the demurrer to the second cause of action is
SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
 
3.    
Civil Code § 2924.9
 
In relevant part, Section 2924.9 requires, within five
business days after recording a notice of default,” a mortgage services that
offers one or more foreclosure prevention alternatives to “send a written
communication to the borrower that includes all of the following information:
(1) That the borrower may be evaluated for a foreclosure prevention alternative
or, if applicable, foreclosure prevention alternatives. (2) Whether an
application is required to be submitted by the borrower in order to be considered
for a foreclosure prevention alternative. (3) The means and process by which a
borrower may obtain an application for a foreclosure prevention alternative.”
(Civ. Code §, 2924.9(a)(1)-(3).) 
 
The complaint alleges no such written communication was sent
following the May 30, 2023 recording of a Notice of Default on the property.  (Compl., ¶ 36.)
 
The demurrer argues Plaintiff is not a borrower and thus
this code section is inapplicable. As explained previously, the Court deems
Plaintiff to be a borrower because of his designation as a “Borrower” in the
Deed of Trust. (RJN, Exh. A.) 
 
Plaintiff has adequately alleged he received no
communications from Defendants after the Notice of Default was recorded.  Plaintiff alleges he was “staying in his home
when the Notice of Default was issued, and received no mail or messages.”
(Compl., ¶ 36.)
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff has adequately pled a violation of
section 2924.9.  The demurrer to this
cause of action is OVERRULED.
 
4.    
Wrongful foreclosure
 
Wrongful foreclosure “is an equitable action to set aside a
foreclosure sale, or an action for damages resulting from the sale, on the
basis that that the foreclosure was improper.”  (Sciarratta v. U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n
(2016) 247 Cal. App. 4th 552, 561.)  The
elements of the tort of wrongful foreclosure are as follows:
 
(1) the trustee or mortgagee caused
an illegal, fraudulent, or willfully oppressive sale of real property pursuant
to a power of sale in a mortgage or deed of trust; (2) the party attacking the
sale...was prejudiced or harmed; and (3) in cases where the trustor or
mortgagor challenges the sale, the trustor or mortgagor tendered the amount of
the secured indebtedness or was excused from tendering.
 
(Id. at 561-562.)  Defendant challenges Plaintiff’s wrongful
foreclosure claim on each of the three elements.
 
Defendant first argues that Plaintiff failed to plead facts
sufficient to show an illegal, fraudulent, or willfully oppressive sale.  The complaint alleges a claim for wrongful
foreclosure based on the alleged violations of HBOR.  (Compl., ¶ 41.) 
 
As to prejudice, the complaint’s allegation that plaintiff
“suffered prejudice or harm as a result of the wrongful foreclosure trustee
sale” is insufficient to meet this element.  (Compl., ¶ 43.) 
 
As to tender, Plaintiff alleged he is excused from the
tender requirements.  (Compl., ¶ 44.) However,
Plaintiff provides no more allegations to support this conclusory statement. 
 
Because the complaint fails to allege facts demonstrating
prejudice or how Plaintiff is excused from tender, the demurrer to this cause
of action is SUSTAINED with leave to amend. 
 
5.    
California Business and Professions Code § 17200, et
seq.
California’s unfair competition law (“UCL”) prohibits any
unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent business act or practice.  (Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200 et seq.)  A claim may be brought under the UCL by a
person who has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a
result of unfair competition.  (Cal. Bus.
& Prof. Code § 17204).  To establish
standing under the UCL, a plaintiff must (1) establish a loss or deprivation of
money sufficient to qualify as injury in fact, i.e., economic injury, and (2)
show that the economic injury was the result of, i.e., caused by, the unfair
business practice that is the gravamen of the claim.  (See Kwikset Corp. v. Superior Court
(2011) 51 Cal.4th 310, 337.)
 
Plaintiff alleges violations of the unfair, unlawful, and
fraudulent prongs of the UCL as a result of Defendant’s alleged HBOR violations.
 
In Jenkins v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 216
Cal.App.4th 497, 522-523, the court affirmed the dismissal of a UCL challenge
to foreclosure where the plaintiff’s default caused the foreclosure. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff lacks standing to maintain a UCL
claim based on the alleged unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent business acts.  The demurrer to this cause of action is
SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
 
6.     Cancellation of Instruments – Civil Code § 3412
 
The sixth cause of action seeks cancellation of the recorded
Notice of Default, Notice of Trustee’s Sale, and Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale.  (Compl., ¶¶ 62, 64.)
 
Under Civil Code section 3412, a court may order the
cancellation of a written instrument if “there is a reasonable apprehension
that if left outstanding it may cause serious injury to a person against whom
it is void or voidable.”  In an action to
cancel a certain instrument, “it is essential to allege the facts affecting the
validity and invalidity of the instrument which is attacked.”  (Kroeker v. Hurlbert (1940) 38
Cal.App.2d 261, 266.) “Cancellation of an instrument is essentially a request
for rescission of the instrument.”  (Deutsche
Bank Nat’l Tr. Co. v. Pyle (2017) 13 Cal. App. 5th 513, 523.)
 
Here, the complaint alleges Plaintiff “has a reasonable
belief that the Notice of Default, instrument no. 20230349457 and Notice of
Trustee’s Sale, instrument no. 20230578462 and Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale are
voidable or void ab initio.”  (Compl., ¶
62.)  It also alleges Plaintiff has a
“reasonable apprehension that if these voidable or void ab initio recorded
written instruments is left outstanding, they may cause serious injury to”
Plaintiff.  (Compl., ¶ 63.)  However, the complaint does not include any
factual allegations explaining how or why the Notice of Default, Notice of
Trustee’s Sale, and Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale are void or voidable. “A plaintiff
must provide facts, ‘not mere conclusions, showing the apparent validity of the
instrument designated, and point out the reason for asserting that it is
actually invalid.”  (Santana v. BSI
Fin. Servs., Inc. (S.D. Cal. 2020) 495 F.Supp.3d 926, 950 quoting Ephraim
v. Metropolitan Trust Co. of California (1946) 28 Cal.2d 824, 833.) 
 
Based on the above, the demurrer to the sixth cause of
action is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
