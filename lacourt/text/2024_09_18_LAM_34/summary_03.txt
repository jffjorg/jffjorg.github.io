And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion of Cedar Adams PC to be relieved as counsel for Diamond Motor Cars, effective upon the filing of proof of service showing that a copy of the signed order has been served on the client at their last known address. The court finds that the requirements of California Rules of Court Rule 3.1362 have been met, and that the attorney-client relationship has been strained due to a lack of meaningful communication and payment. The judge notes that the attorney, Adam K. Obeid, has lost contact with the client and is unable to properly prepare the case for trial. The court determines that granting the motion will not prejudice the client and will not disrupt the orderly process of justice.
