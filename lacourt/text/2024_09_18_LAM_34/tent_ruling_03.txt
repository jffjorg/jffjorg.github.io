Background
 
Plaintiff Shamil Maiden (“Plaintiff”)
alleges the following:
 
On March 12, 2022, Plaintiff
purchased the 2013 Mercedes-Benz C-Class with VIN: WDDGF4HB4DA861746 (the
"Vehicle"). Plaintiff made a total down payment of $4,000 and
financed the remaining balance. The total sale price for the Vehicle on the Retail
Installment Sales Contract was $21,963.52. Before the purchase, Defendant
Diamond Motor Cars’ (“Defendant”) salesperson told Plaintiff that the Vehicle
was in condition, that it had been driven often, that it had even been driven
home by some of Dealer's employees, and that the previous owner maintained it
regularly. Plaintiff bought the Vehicle based on Dealer's representations. By
May 2022, the Vehicle had an engine misfire. Plaintiff took the Vehicle back to
Defendant for a diagnosis, and Defendant charged Plaintiff $380.00 to replace
an ignition coil in the Vehicle. Plaintiff took the Vehicle back again to Defendant
for another issue, and Defendant refused to help Plaintiff. Plaintiff then
towed the Vehicle to Placentia Super Service, where she learned the Vehicle had
a cracked engine. Based on the condition of the Vehicle, the representations
about the Vehicle by were not accurate. 
 
On September 21, 2022, Plaintiff
filed a complaint, asserting causes of action against Defendant and Does 2-75 for:
 
1.              
Civil Code § 1750 et seq.;
2.              
Fraud and Deceit;
3.              
Negligent Misrepresentation; and
4.              
Business and Professions Code § 17200 et seq.
 
A Final Status Conference is
scheduled for September 18, 2024, and a Jury Trial is scheduled for September
30, 2024.
 
Discussion[1]     
 
Cedar Adams LP (“Firm”) seeks to be relieved as counsel of record for Defendant (“Client”).
 
The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw,
and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the
client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of 
justice. (See
Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People v. Prince
(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398.)
 
California
Rules of Court (“CRC”) Rule 3.1362 requires (1) a notice of motion and motion
directed to the client (made on the Notice
of Motion and Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a
declaration stating in general terms and without compromising the
confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of
Civil Procedure § 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under section
284(1) (made on the Declaration in
Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form
(MC-052)); (3) service of the notice of motion and motion, the declaration, and
the proposed order on the client and on all other parties who have appeared in
the case; and (4) a proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). The court may delay the effective
date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy of the
signed order on the client has been filed with the court.
 
Attorney Adam K. Obeid (“Obeid”) represents that he “has lost meaningful
contact with Diamond Motor Cars, Inc., such that counsel has been unable to
properly prepare this case for trial and secure client's witnesses, including
the expert witness retained by client. Further, there are outstanding billables
unpaid from Diamond Motor Cars. The lack of meaningful communication and the
lack of payment has strained the attorney - client relationship to an
unmanageable point. Moreover, the last communication from client was notice
that the business would be shutting down and closing. Under the totality of the
circumstances, counsel can no longer properly represent Diamond Motor Cars.” 
 
The court
determines that the requirements of Rules of Court Rule 3.1362 enumerated above

have been
sufficiently met. 
 
Accordingly, the
motion is granted, effective upon the filing of a proof
of service showing 
service of the signed order upon
the Client at the Client’s last known address.
