And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment. The defendant, Kourosh Parsapour, claims that he was unaware of the default judgment because his attorney, Barton, was handling the case and that he did not discover the judgment until July 2023. However, the court finds that Parsapour's excuses are not satisfactory and that he has failed to demonstrate meritorious defenses, a satisfactory excuse for not seeking timely relief from default, and diligence in seeking relief from the default once discovered. The court notes that Parsapour's motion is untimely and that he is not entitled to relief under Section 473 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
