Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in response to Wells Fargo's demurrer to the third and fourth causes of action in the lawsuit. The judge is overruling Wells Fargo's demurrer to the third cause of action, which alleges an equitable easement on the Zeff Property. The judge finds that the allegations in the First Amended Complaint (FAC) are sufficient to state a cause of action for an equitable easement.

The judge is sustaining Wells Fargo's demurrer to the fourth cause of action, which alleges an easement by necessity on the Zeff Property. The judge finds that the FAC fails to allege that the Zeff Easement is strictly necessary for access to the Reif Property, as the adjacent Kauffman Easement provides an alternative means of access.

The judge orders Wells Fargo to file and serve an Answer to the FAC on or before August 21, 2024.
