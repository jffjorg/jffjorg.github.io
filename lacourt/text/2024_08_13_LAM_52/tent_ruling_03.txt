 Case Number:  23STCV17130    Hearing Date:   August 13, 2024    Dept:  52 Plaintiff’s Counsel’s Motion
to Be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff Chill Space LLC
Attorney Robert L. Wallan
of Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP moves to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff
Chill Space LLC.  The motion meets all requirements
under California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. 

Granting this motion,
however, may prejudice plaintiff.  On
April 29, 2024, the court granted plaintiff’s motion for leave to file an
amended complaint and motion for an order permitting service by publication on
defendant Adam Thomas Martinelli.  The
court ordered plaintiff to file the first amended complaint “forthwith.”  Plaintiff has not filed an amended
complaint.  The court also ordered
plaintiff to submit a proposed order for publication on form LASC LACIV
145.  Plaintiff has not done so.  The court will not permit plaintiff’s counsel
to withdraw from the case until after plaintiff complies with the court’s order
by filing the first amended complaint and submitting a proposed order for
publication on form LASC LACIV 145.
Plaintiff’s counsel’s
motion to be relieved as counsel is denied without prejudice.
