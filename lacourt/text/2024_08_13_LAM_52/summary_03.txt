And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by attorney Robert L. Wallan, seeking to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff Chill Space LLC. The motion is denied without prejudice, meaning it is not final and can be re-filed. The reason for the denial is that the plaintiff has not complied with a previous court order to file an amended complaint and submit a proposed order for publication. The court will not permit the attorney to withdraw from the case until the plaintiff has fulfilled these obligations.
