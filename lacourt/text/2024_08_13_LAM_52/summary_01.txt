And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Westside Lighting, Inc.'s motion to strike defendant Aaron Green's answer and enter default based on a violation of a court order. The plaintiff seeks to strike the defendant's answer as a discovery sanction, citing Code of Civil Procedure 2023.030(d)(1). However, the judge finds that the plaintiff has not shown adequate grounds for terminating sanctions and that striking the defendant's answer would be too severe a punishment. Instead, the judge recommends that the court impose issue or evidence sanctions, as provided in CCP ยง 2023.030, subds. (b) & (c), to accomplish the objects of discovery. The judge denies the plaintiff's motion to strike the defendant's answer.
