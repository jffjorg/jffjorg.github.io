Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has ruled on the demurrer filed by the defendants in the case of Deborah Goldberg v. Serve Automation Inc., et al. The demurrer was filed on August 18, 2023, and the opposition was filed on November 29, 2023. The court has sustained the demurrer in its entirety with leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff must file an amended complaint within 14 days of notice of this order.

The court's analysis of the demurrer is as follows:

* The first, second, and seventh causes of action are sustained with leave to amend, as they fail to state a cause of action for discrimination and retaliation.
* The third, fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action are sustained with leave to amend, as they fail to state a cause of action for failure to prevent and/or investigate discrimination, FEHA retaliation, Labor Code ยง 1102.5 retaliation, and wrongful termination.
* The court has overruled the defendants' demurrer to the alter-ego liability cause of action, as it finds that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged facts supporting this cause of action.

The court's ruling is based on the following legal standards:

* A demurrer tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.
* A complaint must adequately plead facts supporting a cause of action.
* A plaintiff must show that they were engaged in a protected activity and that the employer subjected them to an adverse employment action.

The court has also considered the following case law:
