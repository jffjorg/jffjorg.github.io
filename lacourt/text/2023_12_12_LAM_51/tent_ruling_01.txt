STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On April 5, 2023, Plaintiff Farmand Property LLC (Plaintiff)
filed a Complaint against Defendant Healthy Spot 016 LLC (Defendant) for breach
of contract.
 
According to the Complaint, Plaintiff owns a commercial
building located at 1864 N. Vermont Ave., Los Angeles, California 90027 (the
Property). Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a letter of intent to lease space
at the Property on December 6, 2017, and entered into a written lease and an
Amendment No. 1 on June 15, 2018. Plaintiff alleges that as of January 1, 2023,
Defendant stopped making payments under the lease and notified Plaintiff it had
abandoned the leased portion of the Property. 
 
On April 12, 2023, Plaintiff personally served Defendant.
 
On August 7, 2023, the court found that all named Defendants
had been defaulted as of July 21, 2023. Plaintiff provided notice of this
ruling on August 11, 2023.
 
On September 29, 2023, Plaintiff applied for default
judgment.
 
On October 2, 2023, Plaintiff personally served the default
judgment application on Defendant.
 
On October 6, 2023, Defendant moved ex parte to set aside entry of default, which the court denied on
October 9, 2023.
 
On November 16, 2023, Defendant filed the instant motion. On
December 1, 2023, Plaintiff filed an opposition. Defendant’s reply was due on
or before December 5, 2023. Defendant filed a Reply at 10:59 p.m. on December
7, 2023.
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
“The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a
party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or
other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect…¿ [The application]¿shall be made
within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment,
dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.”¿ CCP¿§¿473(b).¿ 
¿ 
Although a trial court has discretion to vacate the entry
of a default or subsequent judgment, this discretion may be exercised only
after the party seeking relief has shown that there is a proper ground for
relief, and that the party has raised that ground in a procedurally proper
manner, within any applicable time limits.”
¿(Cruz v.¿Fagor¿America, Inc. (2007)
146 Cal.App.4th 488, 495.) “The defendant must … demonstrate a satisfactory
excuse for not responding to the original action in a timely manner.”¿(Id.¿at 504.) Moving parties have the
initial burden to prove excusable neglect by a preponderance of competent
evidence.¿(Kendall v. Barker¿(1988)
197 Cal.App.3d 619, 624.)¿
¿ ¿¿ 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Defendant contends that it neglected to timely file a
response to the Complaint because it was focused on an intensive restructuring
process of its business. Defendant additionally contends it will face
irreparable harm if the court does not grant this relief. Plaintiff argues inexcusable
neglect and Defendant failed to act diligently. 
 
“What is a reasonable time in any case depends upon the
circumstances of that particular case” and “whether a party has acted
diligently is a factual question for the trial court.” (Younessi v. Woolf (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 1137, 1145 [internal
citations omitted].) CCP § 473(b) “is construed liberally to further the policy
of adjudicating legal controversies on the merits.” (Id. at p. 1146.) The question is “whether a reasonably prudent
person under the same or similar circumstances would have made the same error.”
(Ibid.) Because the law strongly
favors trial and disposition on the merits, any doubts in allowing
discretionary relief from adverse orders for mistake, inadvertence, surprise,
or excusable neglect must be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief from
default. (Huh v. Wang (2007) 158
Cal.App.4th 1406.)
 
Here, before the Court reviews the merits, the Court will
discuss the many missteps of Plaintiff. First, as set forth in both Plaintiff’s
and Defendant’s filings, Defendant initially filed a complaint against
Plaintiff 21STCV22902 on June 8, 2021, alleging various causes of action
related to the same lease that underlies the complaint filed by Plaintiff in
23STCV0755 on April 5, 2023. Noticeably absent on the Civil Case Cover sheet is
any notation of this prior related case. On the contrary, counsel Davis, the
same counsel who represented Plaintiff in the prior case, asserts that there
are no related cases. This statement is inaccurate on its face. Moreover, Davis
had actual knowledge that Defendants were represented by counsel, which as
shown below, is significant. Second, counsel Davis filed proof of service that
demonstrated service was complete on April 12, 2023. According to the Declaration
of Davis, representatives for Defendant contacted Davis the very next day, on
April 13, 2023. (Dec. Davis ¶ 2.) Nonetheless, on June 1, 2023, approximately
18 days after a responsive pleading was due, Davis sought entry of default without
providing any written warning to counsel for Defendant. The speed at which
Plaintiff proceeded is not lost on this Court. Apparently, counsel Davis is not
aware of his ethical and legal obligation to warn a represented party in writing
that Davis intended to obtain default and then give a reasonable (i.e. at least
30 days) for a response before seeking default.[1]
Third, on August 7, 2023, counsel Yashar appeared for counsel Davis. No one
reported to the Court that Davis was in communication with counsel for Defendant.
If counsel had made such a report, the Court would have reminded counsel of their
ethical and legal obligation under LaSalle.
With such a record, the Court of Appeal in LaSalle
found that on this record, it was an abuse of discretion for the trial court
not to set aside the default. (LaSalle, supra, 36
Cal.App.5th at p. 137.)
 
With this in mind, discretionary relief here is warranted.
First, Defendant timely sought to set aside default. Defendant first moved to
set aside default on October 6, 2023 – four days after Plaintiff personally
served the default judgment application and less than three months after
receiving notice of the court’s August 11, 2023 ruling setting a hearing on
default and indicating default had been entered against Defendant. Second,
Defendant provided a declaration from a manager indicating that Defendant is
embroiled in what appears to be an extensive restructuring of the company.
(Booonnark Decl. ¶¶ 4, 5.) Plaintiff’s argument that Defendant knew about this
action at the outset and failed to respond is not controlling. Even accepting counsel
Davis’ testimony that Defendant’s accountant Grobstein and Defendant’s counsel
Olsen stopped communicating on June 22, 2023, this in no way relieves counsel
Davis of an ethical and legal obligation to warn counsel Olsen before seeking
default.  The record is absent of counsel
David issuing such an explicit written
warning. Moreover,  the gaps in
communication from Defendant is also consistent
with counsel Olsen’s contention that that Defendant’s actions were excusable
neglect.[2]

 
 
Accordingly, the court GRANTS Defendant’s motion to set
aside default entered on July 21, 2023.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      Motion
to Set Aside Default is GRANTED;
2.      Defendant’s
Proposed Answer attached as Exhibit 1 is deemed filed this day.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
