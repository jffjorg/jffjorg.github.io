And here is the English-text summary:

The court is considering a tentative ruling in the case of Lasalle v. Vogel, in which the plaintiff's attorney sought a default judgment without the knowledge of the defendant's counsel. The court is emphasizing the importance of warning opposing counsel of intent to request entry of default, citing authority from Lasalle v. Vogel and Fasuyi v. Permatex, Inc. The court is also referencing the State Bar Civility Guidelines and The Rutter Group practice guide, which both emphasize the importance of providing written notice of intent to request entry of default and allowing a reasonable time for the opposing party to file a responsive pleading. The court is suggesting that a client amidst restructuring is not necessarily inexcusable neglect, and that an attorney may not claim excusable neglect by being too busy.
