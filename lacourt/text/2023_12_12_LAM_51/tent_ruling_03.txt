STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On June 30, 2023, Plaintiff Deborah Goldberg (Plaintiff)
filed a Complaint against Defendants Serve Automation Inc., Benson Tsai, Brian
Langone, and James Wahawisan (Defendants) with seven causes of action for: (1)
Discrimination (Based on Age) – Disparate Treatment; (2) Discrimination (Based
on Age) – Disparate Impact; (3) Failure to Prevent and/or Investigate
Discrimination; (4) FEHA Retaliation; (5) Labor Code § 1102.5 Retaliation; (6)
Wrongful Termination; and (7) Declaratory & Injunctive Relief.
 
According to the Complaint, Plaintiff was 53 years old when
she was fired on October 7, 2022. She was hired in 2020 by Defendant Serve
Automation Inc. as their Chief Marketing officer. In September 2022, Defendants
told Plaintiff they had lost faith that she could lead the company forward and
that she was out of touch. Plaintiff complained about Defendants’ conduct and
was subsequently terminated.
 
On August 18, 2023, Defendants filed the instant demurrer. Plaintiff
filed an opposition on November 29, 2023. Defendants filed a reply on December
5, 2023.
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
Demurrer
 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states
a cause of action.¿(Hahn v. Mirda¿(2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context.¿In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be
apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice.¿(Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)¿“A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the
evidence or other extrinsic matters. …. The only issue involved in a demurrer
hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous
matters, states a cause of action.”¿(Hahn¿147
Cal.App.4th at 747.) 
 
When considering demurrers, courts
read the allegations liberally and in context, accepting the alleged facts as
true. (Nolte v. Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1406.) Courts also consider exhibits
attached to the complaint and incorporated by reference. (See Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189
Cal.App.3d 91, 94 (Frantz).)
 
Meet and Confer
 
Prior
to filing a demurrer, the demurring party is required to satisfy their meet and
confer obligations pursuant to Code of Civ. Proc. §430.41, and demonstrate that
they so satisfied their meet and confer obligation by submitting a declaration
pursuant to Code of Civ. Proc. §430.41(a)(2) & (3). Upon
reviewing the Declaration of Ashton Riley, the parties met and conferred via
letter on July 24, 2023, by telephone on July 27, 2023, and via email on August
4, 2023, but could not reach an agreement. (Riley Decl. ¶ 5.) Accordingly, the
parties sufficiently met and conferred.
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Individual
Defendants
 
Defendants contend that there are no alleged facts
supporting claims against individual defendants, as individual supervisory
employees, that are separate from the claims against the corporate employer. Defendants
also contend there are insufficient factual allegations supporting alter ego
liability. Plaintiff argues that at least the Fifth Cause of Action provides
for a claim against the individual defendants. Plaintiff additionally argues
that due to the individual defendants’ alter ego liability, they are liable as
employers. Defendants reply that Plaintiffs “boilerplate” allegations are
insufficient to find alter-ego liability.[1]

 
i.                   
Alter
Ego
 
“The essence of the alter ego doctrine is that justice be
done. ‘What the formula comes down to, once shorn of verbiage abound control,
instrumentality, agency, and corporate entity, is that liability is imposed to
reach an equitable result.’ ” (Mesler v.
Bragg Management Co. (1985) 39 Cal.3d 290, 301.) “ ‘It is the law in
California as elsewhere that, although a corporation is usually regarded as an
entity separate and distinct from its stockholders, both law and equity will,
when necessary to circumvent fraud, protect the rights of third persons and
accomplish justice, disregard this distinct existence and treat them as
identical.’” (Kohn v. Kohn (1950) 95
Cal.App.2d 708, 718.)   
 
In Rutherford
Holdings, LLC v. Plaza Del Rey (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 221, 235-36, the
court of appeal held that the following alter ego allegations were sufficient
to survive a demurrer: that the individual defendant dominated and controlled
the entity defendant; that a unity of interest and ownership existed between
the individual defendant and entity defendant; that the entity defendant was a
mere shell and conduit for the individual defendant’s affairs; that the entity
defendant was inadequately capitalized; that the entity defendant failed to
abide by corporate formalities; that the individual defendant used the entity
defendant’s assets as her own; and that recognizing the separate existence of
the entity defendant would promote injustice. 

 
Here, the court agrees with Plaintiff that the Complaint
sufficiently alleges facts for alter-ego liability. The Complaint’s alter-ego
allegations here mirror those in Rutherford.
(Compl. ¶¶ 8, 12.) 
 
Accordingly, the court OVERRULES Defendants’ demurrer on
these grounds.
 
ii.                 
Supervisor
Liability
Employees of an entity subject to FEHA are not personally
liable for FEHA discrimination. (Reno v.
Baird (1998) 18 Cal.4th 640, 643; Leek
v. Cooper (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 399, 408.)
 
Here, the court agrees with Defendants that Plaintiff has
not sufficiently alleged facts of discriminatory conduct by the individual
defendants that is separate and apart from the corporate employer’s acts.
Specifically, the Complaint alleges that the “Employing Defendants” who are
defined as Defendant Serve Automation Inc. and the fictiotusly-named
defendants, not the individual defendants, told Plaintiff that they “lost faith
that Plaintiff could lead the company forward” and that she was “out of touch.”
(Compl. ¶¶ 3, 22.) Additionally, all of Plaintiff’s causes of action refer to
conduct only of the “Employing Defendants” not of the individual defendants. Therefore,
there are no allegations of specific conduct by any individual defendant.
 
Accordingly, the court SUSTAINS Defendants’ demurrer on
these grounds with leave to amend.
 
First Cause of
Action – Discrimination (Based on Age) – Disparate Treatment
 
Defendants contend that Plaintiff has not sufficiently
alleged facts supporting age discrimination claims. Plaintiff alleges that she
plead she is a member of a protected class, that she was terminated, and that
her termination was motivated by her age. 
 
A claim for age discrimination requires plaintiff to show
she was: (1) a member of a protected class (over 40 years old); (2) plaintiff
was qualified or competent for the position sought or performed; (3) plaintiff
suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) some other circumstance
suggesting discriminatory motive. (Guz v.
Bechtel National, Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 317, 355; Sandell v. Taylor-Listug, Inc. (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 297, 321.) 
 
Here, the court agrees with Defendants that Plaintiff failed
to sufficiently allege facts supporting a claim for age discrimination. Specifically,
Plaintiff failed to allege facts supporting the second and fourth elements.
First, Plaintiff does not allege that she was qualified or competent to perform
her job. Indeed, she alleges the opposite. (Compl. ¶ 22.) Second, she alleges
she “believes” that “the perception of her age was a substantial motivating
factor” in her termination, but this is conclusory, not fact.[2]
(Compl. ¶ 28.) 
 
Accordingly, the court SUSTAINS the demurrer to the First
Cause of Action with leave to amend.
 
Second Cause of
Action – Discrimination (Based on Age) – Disparate Impact
 
The analysis here is identical to the First Cause of Action.
 
Accordingly, the court SUSTAINS the demurrer to the
Second Cause of Action with leave to amend.
 
Third Cause of
Action – Failure to Prevent and/or Investigate Discrimination
 
Defendants contend that there is no standalone claim for
failure to prevent and/or investigate discrimination under the Government Code.
Additionally, Defendants contend that there are no factual allegations
supporting such a claim. Plaintiff argues that this cause of action survives
because she sufficiently plead discrimination. Plaintiff also argues that she
did allege notifying Defendants of any potential discrimination.
 
A claim for Failure to Prevent Discrimination requires: (1)
actionable discrimination or harassment by employees or non-employees; (2)
defendant’s legal duty of care toward plaintiff (defendant is plaintiff’s
employer); (3) breach of duty (failure to take all reasonable steps necessary
to prevent discrimination from occurring); (4) legal causation; and (5) damages
to plaintiff. (Trujillo v. No. County
Transit Dist. (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 280, 287, 289; Carter v. Cal. Dept. of Veterans Affairs (2006) 38 Cal.4th 914, 925
fn. 4; Bradley v. Dept. of Corrections
& Rehabilitation (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1612, 1630; Thompson v. City of Monrovia (2010) 186
Cal.App.4th 860, 880; Kelly v. Conco
Companies (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 191, 208.)
 
Here, Plaintiff did not sufficiently allege facts supporting
this cause of action because she did not sufficiently allege actionable
discrimination.
 
Accordingly, the court SUSTAINS the demurrer to the Third
Cause of Action with leave to amend.
 
Fourth Cause of Action
– FEHA Retaliation
 
Defendants contend that Plaintiff has not sufficiently
alleged facts showing a causal link between her termination and any purported
protected activity.[3]
Plaintiff argues that Defendants’ argument is not appropriate at the pleading
stage.
 
A claim for FEHA retaliation requires Plaintiff to show: (1)
she was engaged in a protected activity as an employee; (2) the employer
subjected Plaintiff to an adverse employment action; and (3) a causal link
between the protected activity and the employer’s action. (Thompson, supra, at p. 874; Mokler
v. County of Orange (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 121, 138; Jones v. R.J. Donovan Correctional Facility (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th
1367, 1380.) 
 
Here, Plaintiff did not sufficiently allege facts supporting
this cause of action. First, Plaintiff alleges that she “protested her planned
termination and complained about Defendants’ conduct” and “voiced concerns and
complained about improper workplace behavior under the FEHA.” (Compl. ¶¶ 23, 60.)
Reading the Complaint as a whole, however, these facts do not allege that she
complained about age discrimination or otherwise engaged in a protected
activity.[4]
 
Accordingly, the court SUSTAINS the demurrer to the
Fourth Cause of Action with leave to amend.
 
Fifth Cause of
Action – Labor Code § 1102.5 Retaliation
 
For the same reasons articulated above, the court
SUSTAINS the demurrer to the Fifth Cause of Action with leave to amend.
 
Sixth Cause of
Action – Wrongful Termination
 
Defendants incorporate their arguments to the Fourth Cause
of Action.
 
A claim for wrongful termination in violation of public
policy requires that plaintiff show: (1) an adverse employment action; (2) as a
result of refusing to violate a statute, performing a statutory obligation,
exercising a statutory right, or reporting a statutory violation. (Green v. Ralee Engineering Co. (1998) 19
Cal.4th 66, 76; Stevenson v. Sup. Ct.
(Huntington Mem. Hosp.) (1997) 16 Cal.4th 880, 889-990.) 
 
Like the above discussion, Plaintiff has not sufficiently
alleged that she was terminated as a result exercising a statutory right or
reporting a statutory violation. Indeed, the court sees no allegations in the
Sixth Cause of Action that pertain to the second element of this claim.
 
Accordingly, the court SUSTAINS the demurrer to the Sixth
Cause of Action with leave to amend.
 
Seventh Cause of
Action – Declaratory & Injunctive Relief
 
Defendants contend that this cause of action is a
reformulation of the First through Fourth Causes of Action and so cannot exist
as a standalone cause of action. Additionally, Defendants contend that
Plaintiff does have an adequate remedy at law, namely her demand for money
damages. Plaintiff argues this is a “mixed motive” case so this cause of action
is appropriate as a standalone claim.
 
A plaintiff’s declaratory relief complaint must specifically
allege that an actual, present controversy exists, and must state the facts of
the respective claims concerning the disputed subject matter. (City of Cotati v. Cashman (2002) 29
Cal.4th 69, 79; Connerly v.
Schwarzenegger (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 739, 746 (Connerly).) A sufficient complaint: (1) sets forth facts showing
the existence of an actual controversy relating to the parties’ legal rights
and duties, and (2) requests the court to adjudge these rights and duties. (Ludgate Ins. Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp.
(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 592, 606; Qualified
Patients Ass’n v. City of Anaheim (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 734, 751; see also
Travers v. Louden (1967)
254.Cal.App.2d 926, 931-32 (Travers)
[commenting that declaratory relief may be appropriate for parties with a
continuing relationship].) A declaratory relief claim should not be used to
determine issues that are already engaged by other causes of action. (Hood v. Superior Court (1995) 33
Cal.App.4th 319, 324.)
 
Here, Plaintiff fails to sufficiently state facts sufficient
to support a claim for declaratory and injunctive relief. Specifically,
Plaintiff requests “a declaration from the Court that Employing Defendants have
discriminated and retaliated against Plaintiff and have wrongfully terminated
Plaintiff’s employment.”[5]
(Compl. ¶ 92.) Notably, there is no present controversy alleged. Plaintiff
alleges she was terminated, which is wholly in the past. There are no
allegations of continuing relationship or dispute on current legal rights and
duties.[6]

 
Accordingly, the court SUSTAINS the demurrer to the
Seventh Cause of Action with leave to amend.

to the Complaint is SUSTAINED in its entirety with leave to amend.
2.      Plaintiff
to file an amended complaint within 30 days of notice of this order.
