And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the arguments presented by the Plaintiff and the Employing Defendants in a case related to age discrimination and Labor Code § 1102.5. The judge is not persuaded by the Plaintiff's argument that Labor Code § 1102.5 provides individual liability, as the Plaintiff has failed to plead sufficient facts to support this claim. Additionally, the judge is not convinced that the Employing Defendants' belief that the Plaintiff was "out of touch" constitutes age discrimination. The judge also declines to address the causal link argument at this time and notes that the cause of action is potentially duplicative of other claims in the Complaint. Furthermore, the judge is not persuaded by the Plaintiff's argument for a "mixed-motive" claim, as the Plaintiff has failed to relate the cited authority to the current issues in the case.
