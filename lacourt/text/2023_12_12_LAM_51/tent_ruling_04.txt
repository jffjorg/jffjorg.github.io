Defendants also reply to Plaintiff’s argument that Labor Code § 1102.5 provides
individual liability. First, that Plaintiff reasons by analogy, and not with
authority directly supporting her position. Second, Plaintiff failed to plead
sufficient facts supporting a claim under Labor Code § 1102.5. 


[2]
The court is not persuaded that Plaintiff’s allegation that the “Employing
Defendants believed Plaintiff to be out of touch” is enough to show age

Defendants also contend this fails due to uncertainty.

The court declines to address the causal link argument at this time.


[5]
The court notes Defendants’ position that this cause of action is duplicative
of the other causes of action in the Complaint. 
 


[6]
The court is not persuaded by Plaintiff’s argument for “mixed-motive” claim
because, while she cites authority, she did not relate it to the current
issues.
