And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to set aside the default entered on July 21, 2023. The judge found that the plaintiff's counsel, Davis, failed to provide a written warning to the defendant's counsel, Olsen, before seeking default, and that the plaintiff's actions were not diligent. The judge also noted that the defendant's accountant, Grobstein, and counsel, Olsen, stopped communicating with each other on June 22, 2023, which may have contributed to the delay in the defendant's response. The judge concluded that the defendant's failure to respond was excusable neglect, and that the court should exercise its discretion to set aside the default and deem the defendant's proposed answer filed.
