Lasalle v.
Vogel (2019) 36 Cal. App. 5th 127, 135 (Lasalle), the court spoke at length of
one particular disturbing behavior, which has relevance here, the practice of racing
to the courthouse to obtain default. “ ‘The quiet
speed of plaintiffs' attorney in seeking a default judgment without the
knowledge of defendants' counsel is not to be commended.’ [citation]. . .The
State Bar Civility Guidelines deplore the conduct of an attorney who races
opposing counsel to the courthouse to enter a default before a responsive
pleading can be filed. (Fasuyi v.
Permatex, Inc. (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 681, 702,quoting section 15 of the
California Attorney Guidelines of Civility and Professionalism (2007) (Fasuy).)
Accordingly, it is now well-acknowledged that an attorney has an ethical obligation to warn opposing
counsel that the attorney is about to take an adversary's default. (Id. at pp. 701-702.)” 
“In that regard we heartily
endorse the related admonition found in The Rutter Group practice guide, and we
note the authors' emphasis on reasonable
time: “Practice Pointer: If you're representing plaintiff, and have had any contact with a lawyer representing
defendant, don't even attempt to get
a default entered without first giving such lawyer written notice of your intent to request entry of default, and a reasonable time within which defendant's
pleading must be filed to prevent your doing so.” (Weil & Brown, Cal.
Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2008) § 5:73, p.
5-19 (rev. #1, 2008) as quoted in Fasuyi,
supra, 167 Cal.App.4th at p. 702, 84 Cal.Rptr.3d 351.)” (LaSalle, supra, 36 Cal.App.5th at p. 135.)

While Plaintiff cites authority that an attorney
may not claim excusable neglect by being too busy, they have not cited
authority that a client amidst restructuring is inexcusable.
