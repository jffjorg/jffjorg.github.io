The Petitioner is seeking to impose sanctions on the Respondent for willfully failing to participate in the discovery process. The judge has denied the motion for terminating sanctions, finding that the Respondent's conduct was not willful and that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance. However, the judge has granted the motion for monetary sanctions, awarding $810 to the Petitioner for their costs and expenses.
