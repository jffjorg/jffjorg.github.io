#1 JANITORIAL SPECIALISTS,   
   
        
  vs. 
 
EL CAMINO ON SUNSET, LLC 


 Case No.:  22STCV33777 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  November 30, 2023 



 
Plaintiff #1 Janitorial
Specialists Counsel, Cynthia Valesco’s, Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel is DENIED,
without prejudice. 
 
On
October 18, 2022, Plaintiff #1 Janitorial Specialists (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Defendant El Camino on Sunset, LLC dba Mohawk Bend
(“Defendant”) alleging one cause of action for breach of contract. The
complaint alleges that the parties entered a contract whereby Plaintiff was to
clean Defendant’s property, but in July 2022, Defendant unilaterally canceled
the contract. 
          On March 1, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
First Amended Complaint. 
On April
4, 2023, Defendant El Camino on Sunset, LLC filed an Answer. 
On August
18, 2023, Plaintiff’s attorney filed the current Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel. On September 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Errata concerning
proof of service. As of November 27, 2023, no Opposition has been filed. 
 
Legal Standard 
 
California
Rule of Court rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel) requires (1)
notice of motion and motion to be directed to the client (made on the Notice of
Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a
declaration stating in general terms and without compromising the
confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of
Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under
Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the Declaration in Support of
Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-052)); (3) service
of the notice of motion and motion and declaration on all other parties who
have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order relieving counsel (prepared
on the Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form
(MC-053)).  
The
court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should
be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the client, and it does not
disrupt the orderly process of justice.  (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.) 
 
Discussion 
 
 Counsel
has submitted completed MC-51 and MC-052. Counsel’s declaration indicates that
there has been an irreparable breakdown of the attorney-client relationship,
making it impossible to continue representation. Additionally, counsel has
indicated that Plaintiff was served by mail at Plaintiff’s last known address,
which was confirmed in the last 30 days via conversation. Additionally, Counsel
filed a Notice of Errata on September 27, 2023, which included an amended Proof
of Service that was inadvertently not filed. On Form MC-051, Counsel indicates
that the motion is supported by MC-052 and MC-053. However, form MC-053, the
proposed order, has not been filed with the Court. Thus, Counsel has failed to
comply with Rule 3.1362. 
 
Conclusion 
Plaintiff’s
Counsel’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel is DENIED, without prejudice.
 Counsel
is to file Form MC-053 as required under Rule 3.1362. 
 
Moving Party to give
notice.
