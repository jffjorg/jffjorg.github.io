 Hearing Date: November 30,
  2023



 
Motion
for Terminating Sanctions is DENIED. Motion for Monetary Sanction is GRANTED. 
 
Petitioner
State Farm Automobile Insurance Company moves for terminating sanctions, or
alternatively, evidentiary and issue sanctions against Respondent Navid Faizi. 
 
Background 
On
November 12, 2021, Petitioner/Respondent State Farm Automobile Insurance
Company (“Petitioner”) filed a petition so as to move to compel discovery
responses in its uninsured motorist arbitration action. 
On
December 6, 2021, Petitioner filed 3 separate motions to compel discovery, all
of which were GRANTED. 
On
October 18, 2022, Petitioner filed a Motion for Terminating Sanctions, which
was DENIED. 
Petitioner
filed the instant motion on October 30, 2023. No opposition has been filed as
of November 27, 2023. 
 
Legal
Standard 
 Where
a party willfully disobeys a discovery order, courts have discretion to impose
terminating, issue, evidence, or monetary sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2023.010, subd. (g), 2025.450, subd. (h); R.S.
Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486,
495.)  An evidence sanction prohibits a party that misused the discovery
process from introducing evidence on certain designated matters into evidence.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (c).) Ultimate discovery sanctions are
justified where there is a willful discovery order violation, a history of
abuse, and evidence showing that less severe sanctions would not produce
compliance with discovery rules.  (Van
Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.)  “[A] penalty as
severe as dismissal or default is not authorized where noncompliance with
discovery is caused by an inability to comply rather than willfulness or bad
faith.”  (Brown v. Sup. Ct.
(1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 701, 707.)  The court may impose a terminating
sanction by one of the following orders: 
(1)
An order striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings of any party
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process. 
(2)
An order staying further proceedings by that party until an order for discovery
is obeyed. 
(3)
An order dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that party. 
(4)
An order rendering a judgment by default against that party. 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d).) 
 
 
Discussion 
Terminating
Sanctions: 
Petitioner
moves for terminating sanctions based on Respondent’s failure to produce
discovery responses and to comply with this Court’s order. Petitioner sent
discovery requests on August 26, 2022, and did not receive any responses. This
Court granted Petitioner’s three motions to compel discovery responses.
However, despite the Court order, Petitioner has not received responses from
Respondent. 
Petitioner
argues that terminating sanctions are appropriate because Respondent has not
responded to any of the discovery requests. The “repeated and willful failure
to participate in the discovery process justifies the sanction of dismissing
and barring the Respondent’s demand for Arbitration in the uninsured motorist
action.” (Motion 8: 23-25.) 
“The
trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse “after
considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the party to
determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the propounding party;
and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the discovery.” Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223
Cal.App..4th 377, 390.) Under this standard, trial courts have properly imposed
terminating sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed one or more
discovery orders. (Id.) Terminating
sanctions are to be used sparingly because of the drastic effect of their
application. (Department of Forestry
& Fire Protection v. Howell (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 154, 191.) Moreover,
“the purpose of discovery sanctions is to ‘protect the interests of the party
entitled to[,] but denied[,] discovery,’ not to ‘punish[ ]’ the noncompliant
party or to ‘put the prevailing party in a better position than he would have
had if he had obtained the discovery sought.’ ” (Siry Inv., L.P. v. Farkhondehpour (2020) 45 Cal. App. 5th 1098,
1117, as modified on denial of reh'g (Mar. 23, 2020), aff'd in part, rev'd in
part and remanded, 13 Cal. 5th 333, 513 P.3d 166 (2022).)
Previously,
this Court denied Petitioner’s motion for terminating sanctions as to
Respondent Mariam Ahmadi, stating that there is no evidence that less severe
sanctions would not produce compliance. Petitioner makes similar arguments as
to Respondent Navid Faizi that terminating sanctions are appropriate based on
Respondent’s failure to provide responses. However, Petitioner has failed to
demonstrate why evidentiary or issue sanctions would not be appropriate.
Terminating sanctions are drastic and to be used sparingly. Petitioner has not
demonstrated that Respondent’s conduct was willful, which would allow for
terminating sanctions. 
Motion
for Terminating Sanctions is DENIED. 
 
Monetary
Sanctions:
Additionally,
Plaintiff requests $810 in sanctions against Respondent. This is based on an
hourly rate of $250, with 2 hours spent on preparing the motion, an
anticipatory 1 hour for the hearing on this current motion, and a $60.00 filing
fee. The Court finds that the hourly rate is reasonable. The Court grants the
request for monetary sanctions.
 
Conclusion 
Motion
for Terminating Sanctions is DENIED. Motion for Motion for Monetary Sanctions
is GRANTED. 
 
Moving
Party to give notice.
