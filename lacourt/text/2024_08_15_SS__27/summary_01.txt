And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment, ruling that the plaintiff's claims are without merit. The incident occurred on September 23, 2019, when the plaintiff was involved in a rear-end collision with a vehicle driven by the defendant, Luther Lawson. The plaintiff followed Lawson's vehicle to a Yoshinoya restaurant and observed him enter the restaurant.

The defendant argued that the incident occurred during Lawson's afternoon break and that he was not acting within the scope of his employment at the time. The judge found that the going and coming rule applies to the facts of this case, as Lawson was traveling to a fast food restaurant for a personal break and not for any work-related purpose. The judge also found that the plaintiff failed to present any evidence that would contradict the defendant's argument.

The judge relied on various California court cases, including Sunderland v. Lockheed Martin Aero. Sys. Support (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1, to support its decision. The judge concluded that the incident occurred during Lawson's personal break and that the defendant is not liable for the plaintiff's injuries.
