And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Juan Pablo Ferrufino Mejia vs. Michelle Jo Finkelstein, granting the Plaintiff's motion to seal privileged documents and communications. The Plaintiff's counsel's office accidentally included an email communication from the Plaintiff to his case manager at Parris Law Firm in information provided to Dr. Fishman, the Plaintiff's doctor. The Plaintiff remained unaware of this disclosure until June 18, 2024, when Dr. Fishman was deposed and the email was introduced as Exhibit 7. The Plaintiff requested that the Defendant return or seal the privileged information, but the Defendant refused.

The Court finds that the email exchanges between the Plaintiff and his case manager appear to be protected by attorney-client privilege, as they discuss case evidence, seek legal advice, and instruct counsel on managing a specific aspect of the case. The Defendant's argument that the Plaintiff authorized his attorney to disclose the email to Dr. Fishman in an attempt to influence his professional judgment is speculative and unsupported.

The Court also finds that the Defendant failed to follow the protocol for handling contested information, as set forth in Code of Civil Procedure § 2031.285(b). Therefore, the Court is granting the Plaintiff's motion to seal the privileged documents and communications, and ordering the Defendant to return or destroy any copies of the privileged information in their possession.

The Court notes that the parties should submit to this tentative ruling by email, and that failure to do so may result in the Court taking the motion off calendar or adopting the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.
