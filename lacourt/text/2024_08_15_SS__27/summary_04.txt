And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion to compel a mental examination of the plaintiff is continued. The defendant has demonstrated that the plaintiff's mental condition is in controversy and that there is good cause for the examination. The judge has also found that the defendant's notice of motion meets the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) §2032.320(d) and that the list of potential tests provided by the defendant is concise and provides adequate notice to the plaintiff.

The judge has also determined that the defendant's failure to conduct a meet and confer prior to filing the motion does not constitute a sufficient effort, as the parties were not given a reasonable amount of time to respond or engage in meet and confer. Therefore, the judge has ordered the parties to meet and confer on the plaintiff's mental examination.

The judge has also noted that the parties should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue and that if the parties neither submit nor appear at the hearing, the court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the court.
