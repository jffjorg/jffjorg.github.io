Residential Briarwood Apartments, supra, 171 Cal.App.4th at page 1039, “[t]he statutory remedies are not
exclusive. Quite apart from the statutes, a person in peaceable possession of
real property may recover, in an action sounding in tort, damages for injuries
to his person and goods caused by the forcible entry of one who is, or claims
to be, the lawful owner or possessor…” (Internal quotations omitted.) 


[3]In the motion,
Defendants asserts that “the Preiestleys, as landlord, are obligated to
transfer the apartment unit of a deceased tenant to his estate, which the
Priestleys did by transferring control over the unit and its contents to GiGi
Rust. As the Priestleys’ daughter, Phyllis, was present on the Priestleys’
property at the time, she did effectuate this transfer to GiGi Rust.” (Mot. at
p. 16:23-27.)
