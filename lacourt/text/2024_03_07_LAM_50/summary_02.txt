And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion filed by The Preiestleys, who assert that Soni did not have their permission or consent to live as a tenant at Mr. Rust's apartment. The Preiestleys argue that they are obligated to transfer the apartment unit to GiGi Rust, the deceased tenant's estate, and that Phyllis, their daughter, was present on their property when this transfer occurred. The judge is considering the dispute over whether Soni had permission to live as a tenant and is referencing a previous court decision in Spinks v. Equity Residential Briarwood Apartments, which states that statutory remedies are not exclusive and that a person in peaceable possession of real property may recover damages for injuries caused by forcible entry. The judge is considering the facts and laws presented in the motion and will issue a final ruling after reviewing the arguments and evidence.
