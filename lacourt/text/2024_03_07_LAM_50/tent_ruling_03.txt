[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:  
 
SECOND AMENDED
  APPLICATION FOR ENTRY OF JUDGMENT PURSUANT TO CCP §
  584 
 




            
Plaintiff
Boss Hoss of California, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed a Second Amended Application
for Entry of Judgment stating, inter alia, that Plaintiff “applies by
Second Amended Application for Entry of Judgment against Defendant Angelia
Dimattia.” 
The
Court notes a few defects with Plaintiff’s second amended application for entry
of judgment. 
First, Plaintiff has still not
filed a Request for Court Judgment (Form CIV-100). As noted in the Court’s
October 3, 2023 and November 27, 2023 orders on
Plaintiff’s prior requests for default judgment, “[a] party seeking a default
judgment on declarations must use mandatory¿Request for Entry of Default
(Application to Enter Default)¿(form CIV-100)…” (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800, subd. (a).) The Court notes that Plaintiff
filed a Request for Entry of Default against Angelia Dimattia on July 12, 2023. However, it does not appear that any
Request for Court Judgment has been filed.  
Second,
Plaintiff did not file any Proposed Judgment (Form JUD-100) with the
instant second amended application. A party seeking a default judgment must
file “[a] proposed form of judgment.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1800, subd. (a)(6).) 
Third, as no Request for Court
Judgment or Proposed Judgment were filed with the instant second
amended application, it is unclear what judgment is
sought.  
Based
on the foregoing, the Court denies Plaintiff’s Second Amended Application for
Entry of Judgment without prejudice. The Court will discuss with Plaintiff a
schedule for resubmission of the default judgment package.
