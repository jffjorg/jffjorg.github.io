Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the demurrer filed by the cross-defendants to the first amended cross-complaint is overruled, and the motion to strike is denied. The demurrer was filed to challenge the sufficiency of the allegations in the first amended cross-complaint, specifically the allegations of fraudulent concealment and misrepresentation. The court finds that the allegations sufficiently state a cause of action and that the demurrer fails to contest the sufficiency of the pleadings. The motion to strike was filed to strike the entire second cause of action, which seeks declaratory relief. The court denies the motion to strike, finding that declaratory relief is a viable remedy for resolving disputes over the validity of a contract.
