And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling is for a final status conference in a case where the defense counsel's motion to be relieved has been granted. Despite the court's FSC order on May 22, 2023, no FSC materials have been filed, and it appears that no one wants to litigate the case. The court finds that the case is not ready for trial and vacates the trial date. The court will hold a trial status conference on June 10, 2024, to inquire whether the parties want to dismiss the case without prejudice and walk away. If not, the court will set a new trial date, but notes that the various cut-offs have all passed. The court may re-set the matter for some time in December 2024 and also set an OSC re: Dismissal for Failure to Prosecute.
