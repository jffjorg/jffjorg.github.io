 Case Number:  22SMCV02357    Hearing Date:   June 3, 2024    Dept:  I The matter is here for a final status conference.  Defense counsel’s motion to be relieved was
just granted, although defense counsel states that the client has been aware of
the issue since December.
 
The court’s FSC order was given on May 22, 2023—over a year
ago.  Yet no FSC materials have been
filed.  It appears that no one wants to
litigate this case.  
 
In any event, the matter is plainly NOT READY FOR
TRIAL.  The trial date is vacated.  The court will hold a TSC on June 10, 2024,
at 8:30.  At that time, the court will
inquire whether the parties want to dismiss the case without prejudice and walk
away.  If not, the court will set a trial
date, but the court notes that the various cut-offs have all passed.  The court may well re-set the matter for some
time in December of this year and also set an OSC re: Dismissal for Failure to
Prosecute.
