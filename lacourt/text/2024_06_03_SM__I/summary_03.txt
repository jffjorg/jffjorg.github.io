This is a tentative ruling in a case where the plaintiff alleges that the defendant broker, Elliman, breached their fiduciary duty and committed fraud. The court has denied the defendant's demurrer and allowed the plaintiff's claims to move forward. The court found that Elliman had a duty to disclose information to the plaintiff, given their fiduciary relationship and Elliman's knowledge of the development of the adjacent property. The court also found that the defendant's representations of superior "market intel" constituted an obligation to gather more information. The court further found that the defendant's failure to disclose information constituted fraud. The case is set for further litigation.
