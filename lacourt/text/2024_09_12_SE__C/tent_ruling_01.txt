  Case Number:  21STCV11698    Hearing Date:   September 12, 2024    Dept:  C John
G.Z. DOE #1, et al. vs. ROE #1, Case No. 21STCV11698
 
This
is action for child sexual assault. Defendant moves ex parte to specially set
the hearing date on LAUSD’s motion for discovery of John G.Z. Doe #1’s Pitchess
Motion on a different date than the trial date. The Pitchess Motion is currently
scheduled November 6, 2024, which is the same date as trial.  The parties agreed to set the motion for
October 15, 2024 at the earliest. 
 
The
ex parte application is DENIED.  The
Court cannot accommodate Defendant’s request for a hearing on the Pitchess Motion
before trial.  The parties are not foreclosed
from seeking a trial continuance in Dept. SE-F. 
It appears to the Court that a trial continuance will be needed in any
event for Defendant to obtain the discovery it seeks.  
 
Moving
party to give notice.
