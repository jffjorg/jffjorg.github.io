And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The East Whittier School District's motion for summary judgment is granted. The motion for summary adjudication is moot. The plaintiff, John Pehrsson, alleges that he was sexually assaulted by his teacher, Jim Wiggins, while he was a minor in the 1967-1968 school year. Pehrsson claims that the school district is liable for the assault due to its negligence in supervising Wiggins and failing to report the abuse under the Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act.

The court finds that the school district did not have knowledge of Wiggins' inappropriate sexual propensities and therefore is not liable for the assault. The court also finds that Pehrsson has failed to provide evidence that the school district had a mandatory duty to report the abuse under the Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act.

The court grants the school district's motion for summary judgment, finding that there is no triable issue of material fact and that the school district is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
