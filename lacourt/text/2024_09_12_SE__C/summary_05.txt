And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled to continue the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to the request for production of documents until February 20, 2025. The court is not persuaded that counsel have exhausted their meet and confer obligations and instructs them to make further efforts to resolve the issues. If the issues are not resolved, counsel are to submit a joint statement outlining the remaining disputed issues for a ruling. The court also reminds counsel to review the Case Management Conference Order issued on August 16, 2023, as the discovery issues may be moot.
