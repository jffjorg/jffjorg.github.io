The judge is continuing the hearing on the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to the defendant's request for production of documents. The judge is not persuaded that counsel have exhausted their meet and confer obligations and is ordering counsel to make further efforts to resolve the discovery disputes. Counsel are instructed to meet and confer on the issues outlined in the motion and submit a joint statement outlining the remaining disputed issues for which a ruling is required. If counsel are unable to informally resolve their discovery disputes, they may appear and argue the merits on the continued hearing date.
