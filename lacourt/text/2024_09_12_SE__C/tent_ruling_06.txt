AND SURETY COMPANY OF AMERICA v. JOSLEVIN REALTY CORP. OF L.A.
CASE NO.: 23NWCV01813
HEARING:  09/12/24
 
#10
 
Plaintiff TRAVELERS CASUALTY AND SURETY COMPANY OF AMERICA’s
motion for discharge is GRANTED.  
 
Moving Party to give notice. 
 
Plaintiff TRAVELERS CASUALTY AND SURETY COMPANY OF AMERICA
(“Travelers”) seeks an order that (1) Travelers deposit with the Clerk of the
Court the insurance proceeds payable under insurance policy number
Y-630-7F094319-TIL-12 issued by Travelers to Joseph Levin Realty Corp. of Los
Angeles due to a fire loss on or about November 22, 2022 at a commercial
building insured by that policy located at 5830 Soto Street, Huntington Park,
California 90255 totaling $1,772,547.92; (2) That upon making such deposit Travelers
be discharged form any further liability to any party to this action relating
to said Insurance Proceeds so deposited; and (3) That upon making such deposit,
Travelers be dismissed as a party to this interpleader action. Travelers
contends that it has no interest in the interpleaded funds. 
 
It is clear that Travelers is subject to potentially
conflicting claims, and such claims might give rise to multiple liability.
Travelers is entitled to discharge, and dismissal from the interpleader
proceeding. The Court finds that Travelers satisfies the requirements set forth
in CCP §386.5 for an Order discharging Travelers from liability upon Travelers
depositing with the clerk of the court the amount in dispute, less fees and
costs.  
 
In Response to Travelers’ Motion, Defendant JosLevin Realty
Corp. of L.A. (“JosLevin”) does not substantively oppose Travelers’ requests.
However, JosLevin maintains that Travelers may owe additional sums under the
Policy and requests that any discharge from this Court be expressly limited to
the Insurance Proceeds and not to any other obligation owed under the Policy,
and that any dismissal of Travelers as to this interpleaded action be without
prejudice. These requests are reasonable. 
 
The Motion is GRANTED. Plaintiff TRAVELERS CASUALTY AND
SURETY COMPANY OF AMERICA is ORDERED to submit a Proposed Order integrating the
limitations set forth in JosLevin’s Response within 5 days from the date of the
Court’s issuance of this Order. The Court will then sign the Proposed Order .
