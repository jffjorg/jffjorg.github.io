And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's ex parte application to set a hearing date for the Pitchess Motion on a different date than the trial date. The Pitchess Motion is currently scheduled for November 6, 2024, which is the same date as the trial. The parties had agreed to set the motion for October 15, 2024 at the earliest. The judge does not believe that it is possible to accommodate the defendant's request for a hearing on the Pitchess Motion before the trial. Instead, the parties may need to seek a trial continuance in order for the defendant to obtain the discovery it seeks.
