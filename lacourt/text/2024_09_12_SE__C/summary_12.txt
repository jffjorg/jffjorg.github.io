And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied an ex parte application by National Commercial Recovery, Inc. (Plaintiff) to enforce a settlement agreement against C&B Croissants, Inc. (Defendant). The settlement agreement, entered into on August 21, 2024, required the Defendant to make weekly payments from August 22, 2024, to November 7, 2024, totaling $35,292.05. However, the Defendant has failed to make any payments. Instead of granting the ex parte application, the judge has specially set a hearing on the Plaintiff's motion to enforce the settlement agreement for October 9, 2024, at 9:30 a.m. in Department SE-C. The Plaintiff is required to file and serve opposition and reply briefs in compliance with the new hearing date.
