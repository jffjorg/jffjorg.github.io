And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the plaintiff's motion to compel compliance with the court's January 24, 2024 order is moot, as the defendant has produced verified responses to the order on August 29, 2024. However, the judge has granted the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions, ordering the defendant to pay $2,000.00 within 60 days. The judge has also denied the plaintiff's alternative requests for evidentiary, issue, and terminating sanctions. The judge's decision is based on the fact that the defendant's failure to comply with the court's order was caused by a delay and was not a complete abandonment of the case.
