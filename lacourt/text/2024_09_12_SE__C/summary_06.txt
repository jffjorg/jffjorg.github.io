And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled in favor of Travelers Casualty and Surety Company of America's motion for discharge. Travelers seeks to deposit insurance proceeds with the Clerk of the Court, totaling $1,772,547.92, and be discharged from liability and dismissed from the interpleader action. The Judge finds that Travelers satisfies the requirements for an order discharging it from liability, as set forth in CCP ยง386.5. The Defendant, JosLevin Realty Corp. of L.A., does not oppose Travelers' requests, but asks that any discharge be limited to the insurance proceeds and not to other obligations, and that any dismissal be without prejudice. The Judge grants the motion, but orders Travelers to submit a proposed order integrating the limitations set forth in JosLevin's response within 5 days.
