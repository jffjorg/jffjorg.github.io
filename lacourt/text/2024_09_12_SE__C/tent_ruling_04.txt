Moving
Party to give notice. 
 
Counsel
Soheyl Tahsildoost filed a Substitution of Attorney on behalf of Defendant
AMERICAN HONDA MOTOR CO. (“Defendant”) on May 10, 2024 in place of former
counsel Armen Hairpetian. 
 
This
matter was originally set for hearing on June 20, 2024. However, at the June
20, 2024 hearing, Counsel for Plaintiff indicated that Defendant’s new counsel
of record was not served with the Subject Motion, and there was no appearance
on behalf of the Defendant at the hearing. Consequently, this matter was
CONTINUED from June 20, 2024, to today’s date, to ensure that defendant and
their new counsel of record received notice of this hearing.
 
Plaintiffs
move to compel Defendant’s compliance with the Court’s January 24, 2024
Compliance Order, and for monetary sanctions. Alternatively, Plaintiffs move
for the issuance of evidentiary, issue, and/or terminating sanctions.  
 
In
Opposition, Defendant argues that the Motion is moot because Defendant produced
“the verification and all responsive documents in compliance with this Court’s
Order” on August 29, 2024. (Opp. 3, ¶10; Zipser Decl., ¶10.) 
 
In
Reply, Plaintiffs acknowledge that Defendant produced verified responses to the
January 24, 2024 Order on August 29, 2024. (See Reply 1:2-5.) However,
Plaintiffs maintain that monetary sanctions should still issue due to
Defendant’s dilatory tactics which caused a delay of this case. 
 
To
the extent authorized by this chapter governing any particular discovery method
or any other provision of this title, the court, after notice to any affected
party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may impose
[sanctions] against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the
discovery process …” (CCP §2023.030.) Failing to respond to an authorized
method of discovery and disobeying a court order to provide discovery are both
misuses of the discovery process. (CCP §§2023.010 (d) and (g).)
 
It
is a commonly stated axiom that discovery sanctions “should be appropriate to
the dereliction and should not exceed that which is required to protect the
interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978)
84 Cal.App.3d 771, 793.) However, a court is empowered to apply the ultimate
sanction against a litigant who persists in the outright refusal to comply with
discovery obligations. The refusal to reveal material evidence is deemed to be
an admission that the claim or defense is without merit. (Id. at
794-795.) 
 
The request for issue, evidentiary, and terminating sanctions is
DENIED. It is undisputed that untimely responses were ultimately served on
August 29, 2024. The imposition of issue, evidentiary, or terminating sanctions
would be unduly punitive under these facts because Defendant has not completely
abandoned this case or its responsibility to participate in the discovery
process. 
 
Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,285.00.  Monetary sanctions are warranted here because
it is undisputed that compliance with this Court’s January 25, 2024 Discovery
Order was untimely, and required Court intervention.  However, the Court also considers the fact
that new counsel for Defendant came into the case on May 10, 2024, and as of
June 20, 2024, new counsel had not received the Subject Motion.  Therefore, Defendant is ORDERED to pay
Plaintiffs and their counsel of record sanctions in the amount of $2,000.00
within 60 days from the date of the Court’s issuance of this Order.
