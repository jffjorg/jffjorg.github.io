Client agrees that Attorney’s contingent fee shall be: 25% if there is recovery by settlement before filing a complaint or arbitration demand; 33% if there is recovery after filing a complaint or arbitration demand; and 40% after a trial, if approved by the trial judge.” (Ibid.)

Code, § 2611, subd. (c).Pursuant to Prob. Code, § 3604, subd. (b), in order to approve the request to establish and fund a Special Needs Trust the Court must make the following findings:1) That the person (who will be named as the beneficiary of the trust) has a disability which substantially impairs the person’s ability to provide for the individual's own care or custody and constitutes a substantial handicap2) That the person with a disability is likely to have special needs that will not be met without the trust3) That the money to be paid to the trust does not exceed the amount that appears reasonably necessary to meet the special needs of the person with a disability.The Court has made these findings herein, and therefore, the analysis of the petition turns to whether the proposed trust instrument complies with the requirements of Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.903 and Super. Ct. L.A. County, Local Rules, rule 4.116 for trusts established and/or funded by court order.
