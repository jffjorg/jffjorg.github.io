Summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling in this case is that the Defendant's motions to compel discovery are moot. However, the Plaintiff is sanctioned for not responding to discovery in a timely manner. The Plaintiff is ordered to pay $1,400 per set of discovery, totaling $5,600, within 30 days. The Plaintiff's failure to respond to discovery prompted the Defendant to file the motions, which were necessary to obtain the required responses. The Judge also notes that the Plaintiff's counsel indicated that the discovery responses were served electronically on September 2, 2024, but the Court still finds that the motions were necessary to prompt the Plaintiff to provide the discovery responses.
