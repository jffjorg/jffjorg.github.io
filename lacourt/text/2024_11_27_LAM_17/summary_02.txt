And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendant's motion to seal certain documents related to his consulting business and nonprofit fundraising activities is granted. The documents in question include a redacted invoice, a redacted email correspondence, and a redacted screenshot from the defendant's nonprofit organization's CRM. The defendant argues that these records should be sealed because they contain sensitive business information. The plaintiff argues that the documents themselves have already been redacted, making them confidential. The court notes that it previously granted the defendant's oral motion to seal the case in its entirety, and therefore all filings have been implicitly deemed sealed. The judge orders that the documents be sealed.
