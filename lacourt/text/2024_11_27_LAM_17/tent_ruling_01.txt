  vs.
 
MANHATTAN LOFT LLC, et al. 
  


 Case
  No.:  23STCV12769  
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  November 27, 2024




 
 
Defendant’s
motions to compel discovery are MOOT.
 
Plaintiff is
sanctioned, jointly and severally with counsel, $1,400 per set of discovery,
for a total of $5,600 payable within 30 days. 
 
On 6/5/2023,
Plaintiff Timothy Kinman (Plaintiff) filed suit against 12 distinct Defendants.
On 10/26/2024, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint (FAC) alleging: (1)
violation of Civil Code section 1942.4; (2) tortious breach of the warranty of
habitability; (3) private nuisance; (4) business and professions Code section
17200; (5) negligence; (6) breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment; (7)
intentional infliction of emotional distress; (8) negligence per se; (9)
violation of Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA); (10) toxic environmental mold
tort; (11) violation of tenant anti-harassment ordinance; (12) California
Welfare and Institutions Code section 15600; and (13) false advertising. 
 
On 8/23/2024,
Defendant Manhattan Loft, LLC moved to have its Requests for Admission (RFAs)
deemed admitted as to Plaintiff. Defendant also moved to compel initial
responses from Plaintiff to its: (1) Form Interrogatories; (2) Special
Interrogatories; and (3) Requests for Production (RFPs.) 
 
For ease, the
Court has consolidated its ruling into a single analysis. 
 
Discussion
 
            As
a preliminary matter, Defendant consolidated its motion to compel responses to
Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and RFPs. Given that each is a
distinct set of discovery, Defendant must still issue three filing fees for
this consolidated motion.
 
            As
for the substance of Defendant’s motions, on 3/19/2024, Defendant served
Plaintiff with the subject discovery. As such, responses were due on 4/22/2024.
Defendant indicated that at the time of these motions’ filing no response to
discovery had been received, and an extension to respond was not timely
requested. (Wayne Decl. ¶3)
 
            In
opposition, Plaintiff’s counsel indicated that discovery responses were served
electronically on 9/2/2024. 
 
            Given
that these motions were filed on 8/23/2024, the Court still finds that
Defendant’s motions were necessary to prompt Plaintiff to provided discovery
responses. This is especially true given that responses were initially due in
April 2024. 
 
            Based
on the foregoing, Defendant’s motions to compel discovery are moot. Plaintiff
is sanctioned, jointly and severally with counsel, $1,400 per set of discovery.
(350/hr x 4 hr.)  
 
 
It is so ordered.
