And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Steven Kahana vs. Marcus Gaede, case number 24STCV17034. The ruling states that the defendant's demurrer is moot, meaning it is no longer relevant. This is because the plaintiff, Steven Kahana, filed a first amended complaint (FAC) after the defendant demurred to his original complaint. As a result, the defendant's demurrer is no longer necessary. The court has ordered that the parties submit on this tentative by email to the court by 4pm the day prior to the hearing date of November 27, 2024. If all parties submit on the tentative, the court will adopt it as the final order.
