English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to compel arbitration as moot. The defendant had moved to compel arbitration of the dispute, but the parties had stipulated to stay the action pending mediation. The plaintiff brought a representative PAGA action for civil penalties under the Private Attorneys General Act. The court found that the plaintiff retains standing to bring a representative PAGA action, even if they do not bring an individual PAGA claim. The court declined to impose additional standing requirements and cited several court decisions, including Adolph v. Uber Technologies, Inc. and Balderas v. Fresh Start Harvesting, Inc. The court denied the defendant's motion to compel arbitration as moot, as the plaintiff does not bring an individual PAGA claim.
