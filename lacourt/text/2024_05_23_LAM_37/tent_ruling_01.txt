Background
 
On November 14, 2022,
Courtney Hughes (“Hughes”) filed a Complaint against Public Storage
(“Defendant”) and Does 1 to 50. The Complaint alleges a PAGA action for Civil
Penalties under the Private Attorneys General Act. (Lab. Code § 2698 et.
seq.) and asserts a representative PAGA claim but no individual PAGA claim.
 
On February 2, 2023,
Defendant filed a motion to compel arbitration, but before the hearing the
parties stipulated to stay the action pending mediation. On February 23, 2024, Defendant
renewed their motion to compel arbitration. Plaintiff opposed the Motion. 
 
On April 16, 2024,
the court ordered supplemental briefing as to whether the Plaintiff could
pursue a representative PAGA claim for civil penalties without alleging an
individual PAGA claim. The matter is now again before the court.

motion to
compel arbitration
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
Parties may be compelled to arbitrate a dispute
upon the court finding that: (1) there was a valid agreement to arbitrate
between the parties; and (2) said agreement covers the controversy or
controversies in the parties’ dispute.¿(CCP, § 1281.2; Omar v. Ralphs
Grocery Co. (2004)¿118 Cal.App.4th 955, 961.)¿ 
¿¿ 
A party petitioning to compel arbitration has the
burden of establishing the existence of a valid agreement to arbitrate and the
party opposing the petition has the burden of proving, by a preponderance of
the evidence, any fact necessary to its defense. (Banner Entertainment, Inc.
v. Superior Court¿(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 348, 356-57.)¿¿ 
¿ 
“If
a court of competent jurisdiction, whether in this State or not, has ordered
arbitration of a controversy which is an issue involved in an action or
proceeding pending before a court of this State, the court in which such action
or proceeding is pending shall, upon motion of a party to such action or
proceeding, stay the action or proceeding until an arbitration is had in
accordance with the order to arbitrate or until such earlier time as the court
specifies.” (CCP, § 1281.4.)¿ 
 
II.        Request for Judicial Notice
 
The court may take
judicial notice of records of any court of record of the United States. (Evid.
Code, § 452(d)(2).) However, the court may only judicially notice the existence
of the record, not that its contents are the truth. (Sosinsky v. Grant
(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1548, 1565.)

Minute Order (October 27, 2023)
 
Defendant’s request
for judicial notice is granted. 
 
In its supplemental brief,
Plaintiff requests judicial notice of the following: 
 
1)    
The published opinion of the Court of
Appeal of the State of California Second Appellate District Division Six, in
the matter of Lizbeth Balderas v. Fresh Start Harvesting, Inc.
(Cal. Ct. App., Mar. 20, 2024, No. 2D CRIM. B326759) 2024 WL 1673112, as
modified (Apr. 18, 2024) (“Balderas”) (Santa Barbara Super. Ct. Case No.
22CV02246), attached hereto as Exhibit A.
 
Plaintiff’s request for
judicial notice is granted. 
 
III.      Evidentiary Objections
 
Defendant objects as
follows: 
 
Objection
No. 1 to Exhibit A of Plaintiff’s Opposition. The objection is sustained as
Exhibit A has not been properly authenticated.
 
IV.       Discussion 
 
Plaintiff’s
opposition to this Motion does not dispute that on February 7, 2020, Plaintiff
signed a Pre-Employment Consent, Authorization and Release Form in which she stated
she understood that the arbitration of any employment disputes was a condition
of employment. (Coates Decl. ¶ 8, Ex. B.) Attached as Exhibit F to the Tara
Coats Declaration is a copy of the Abirritation Agreement Plaintiff agreed to
abide by. (Coats Decl. Ex. F.) 
 
However, Plaintiff asserts that
because she brings only a representative PAGA action, the action cannot be
compelled to arbitration.  “Where a plaintiff has brought a PAGA
action comprising individual and non-individual claims, an order compelling
arbitration of the individual claims does not strip the plaintiff of standing
as an aggrieved employee to litigate claims on behalf of other employees under
PAGA.” (Adolph v. Uber Technologies, Inc. (2023) 14 Cal.5th
1104, 1114  (Adolph). Plaintiff
asserts that pursuant to Adolph, PAGA claims are severable and that she
can bring a representative PAGA claim without bringing an individual PAGA
claim. 
 
Defendant argues that
Plaintiff’s PAGA claims cannot be severed into individual and representative
PAGA claims and Plaintiff “cannot evade arbitration by unilaterally foregoing the
(arbitrable) individual component of her PAGA claim and skipping straight to
litigation of the (non-arbitrable) representative component.” (Defendants’
Supp. Brief at p. 1:3-5.) Instead, the court should compel Plaintiff to submit the
individual component of Plaintiff’s PAGA claim and stay the representative
component.” (Id. at p. 1:5-6.) 
 
In Balderas v. Fresh Start
Harvesting, Inc. (2024) 101 Cal.App.5th 533, the Court of Appeal for the Second
District found that even if an employee does not bring an individual PAGA
action, the employee retains standing to bring a representative PAGA action. “[W]e
hold that an employee who does not bring an individual claim against her
employer may nevertheless bring a PAGA action for herself and other employees
of the company.” (Ibid.)
 
The Balderas Court rejected the
trial court finding that “because [the plaintiff] had not filed an individual
action seeking PAGA relief for herself, she lacked standing to pursue a
“non-individual” or representative PAGA action on behalf of other employees.” (Balderas,
supra, 101 Cal.App.5th at p. 533.) 
 
The Balderas court
explained that despite the plaintiff not bringing an individual PAGA action,
the plaintiff retained standing under Adolph to bring a representative
PAGA claim because in her complaint: 
 
She alleged that she 1) was an “aggrieved”
employee of Fresh Start, and 2) was subject to one or more Fresh Start
violations. She alleged, “[W]hen Employees including Ms. Balderas started work
for Fresh Start at around 6:00 a.m. or 7:00 a.m., they regularly were not
provided a meal period until after 5 hours of work for shifts longer than 5
hours.” This delay in providing timely meal periods for her and other employees
violated their right to have “a meal period within the first five (5) hours of
work.”

(Balderas, supra, 101 Cal.App.5th at p. 533.)
 
Accordingly, the plaintiff in Balderas
met the only two requirements needed for PAGA standing, (1) she was an
employee of the alleged violator and(2) was someone “against whom one or more
of the alleged violations was committed.” (Id. at p. 533; see Lab. Code,
§ 2699)(c).) In accordance with the California Supreme Court’s findings in Adolph
and Kim v. Reins
International California, Inc.¿(2020) Cal.5th
73, the Balderas Court declined to impose additional standing
requirements, such as requiring the plaintiff to bring both an individual and a
representative PAGA action. 
 
This court also declines to find that the
Plaintiff is required to bring an individual PAGA claim to proceed or retain
standing to bring her representative PAGA claim.  Should Defendant wish to challenge Plaintiff’s
standing to bring a PAGA action, Defendant should file a demurrer. Moreover, even
if Defendant wishes to challenge the findings of the Balderas Court, this
court is bound by the findings of the Second District. “Courts
exercising inferior jurisdiction must accept the law declared by courts of
superior jurisdiction. It is not their function to attempt to overrule
decisions of the higher court.” (Auto Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior
Court (1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 455; see also Cuccia v. Superior
Court (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 347, 353–354.) 
 
As representative PAGA claims cannot be
compelled into arbitration and Plaintiff brings no individual PAGA claims for
damages, Defendant’s Motion is moot. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant’s Motion to Compel Arbitration is denied as
moot. Defendant to give notice.
