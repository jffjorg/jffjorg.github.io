SUMMARY OF ACTION 
& PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
On 4/7/23, Plaintiff Ha Hoang Nguyen (Plaintiff) filed
this action against Defendants Amy Jam and Mohsen Haddad (collectively,
Defendants) for unlawful detainer.  
 
On 8/15/23, after a court trial, the Court entered
judgment in favor of Plaintiff awarding Plaintiff possession of the disputed
real property, holdover damages of $62,500.00 and costs of $750.00 for a total
monetary judgment of $63,250.00.
 
On 8/30/23, Plaintiff filed and served a memorandum of
costs in the amount of $14,176.75 which Defendants did not challenge by way of
a motion to tax or strike costs.
 
On 10/27/23, Plaintiff filed and served the instant
motion seeking an order amending the judgment entered on 8/15/23 pursuant to
CCP 187 to reflect the cost bill of $14,176.75 for
a total judgment of $76,676.75.  
  
On 1/23/24, Defendants filed a Notice of Stay of
Proceedings based on the bankruptcy filing by Defendants.
 
Defendants have not filed an opposition to the instant
motion.      
 
ANALYSIS
 
CRC 3.1700(a)(1) provides: 
 
“A prevailing party who claims
costs must serve and file a memorandum of costs within 15 days after the date
of service of the notice of
entry of judgment or dismissal by the clerk under Code
of Civil Procedure section 664.5 or the date of service of written
notice of entry of judgment or dismissal, or within 180 days after entry of
judgment, whichever is first. The memorandum of costs must be verified by a
statement of the party, attorney, or agent that to the best of his or her
knowledge the items of cost are correct and were necessarily incurred in the
case.”
 
CRC 3.1700(b)(1) provides:
 
“Any notice of motion to strike or
to tax costs must be served and filed 15 days after service of the cost
memorandum. If the cost memorandum was served by mail, the period is extended
as provided in Code
of Civil Procedure section 1013. If the cost
memorandum was served electronically, the period is extended as provided
in Code
of Civil Procedure section 1010.6(a)(4).”
 
CRC 3.1700(b)(4) provides: 
 
“After the time has passed for a
motion to strike or tax costs or for determination of that motion, the clerk
must immediately enter the costs on the judgment.”
 
Based on the foregoing, if the Judgment entered on
8/15/23 did not already award costs in the amount of $750.00, the Court would
find that Plaintiff is entitled to an order amending the Judgment to include
the $14,176.75 in prejudgment costs included in Plaintiff’s Memorandum of Costs
filed and served on 8/30/23 which Defendants did not challenge within the time
required well before they filed for bankruptcy protection.
 
The motion claims that the 8/15/23 Judgment included an “initial
estimate” of costs ($750.00) related to service and filing fees and claims that
there were many more costs associated with trial which were reflected in the
memorandum of costs.  (See Motion,
p.4:10-15).  However, the Judgment does
not indicate that the $750.00 in costs awarded were merely an estimate that
could be augmented by a subsequent memorandum of costs.  (See 8/15/23 Judgment).  Nor does Plaintiff provide any authority
which allows a party to provide one amount for costs at the time of Judgment
and then drastically increase that amount by way of a later filed cost
memorandum.  Plaintiff’s counsel also
does not explain why the Judgment did not leave the costs to be entirely
determined by a subsequently filed cost memorandum rather than include only a
small fraction of such costs in the Judgment. 
Further, it is not clear whether the $454.22 for filing and motion fees
included in the memorandum of costs was included in the $750.00 already awarded
for costs which purportedly included estimated costs related to service and
filing fees.  
 
CONCLUSION
 
The Court finds that because an opposition to this motion
was due after Defendants’ bankruptcy filing, the hearing on the motion is
stayed.  Once the bankruptcy is lifted,
Plaintiff’s counsel must contact the Court to reschedule the hearing on the
motion at least 30 days thereafter.
 
At least 16 court days before the rescheduled hearing
date, Plaintiff must file and serve a supplemental brief providing authority
which allows a party to claim additional costs via a cost memorandum after
costs were already awarded in the Judgment.
 
Any opposition to the motion will be due at least 9 court
days before the rescheduled hearing date and any reply will be due at least 5
court days before the continued hearing date.
