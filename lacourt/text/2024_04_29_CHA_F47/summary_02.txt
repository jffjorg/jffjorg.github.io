Here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff's motion to amend the judgment to include additional costs is stayed due to the defendants' bankruptcy filing. The court has ordered the plaintiff to reschedule the hearing at least 30 days after the bankruptcy is lifted. Prior to the rescheduled hearing, the plaintiff must file and serve a supplemental brief providing authority for claiming additional costs via a cost memorandum after costs were already awarded in the judgment. The court has also set deadlines for opposition and replies to the motion.
