And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings, which sought to dismiss the plaintiffs' claim for quiet title to a prescriptive easement. The defendants, Robert and Kathleen Goldberg, had argued that the plaintiffs, Anthony and Jeannene Scearce, had failed to state a claim for prescriptive easement in their complaint. However, the court found that the defendants had improperly included an alternative motion in limine to exclude evidence contradicting permissive use at trial, which was not properly supported by the pleadings. Additionally, the court noted that the plaintiffs had failed to explain why they did not move to amend their complaint to add a claim for prescriptive easement. As a result, the court denied the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings.
