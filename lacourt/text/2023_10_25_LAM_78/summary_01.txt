This is a tentative ruling on a motion for summary judgment/summary adjudication filed by Defendant Doe 3 Local Church. The motion is granted as to the cause of action for sexual battery related to Perpetrator 1's alleged abuse of Plaintiff Anaiah Shehori while Perpetrator 1 was babysitting her, but denied as to the remaining causes of action. The court finds that Doe 3 had a special relationship with Plaintiff and owed her a duty to protect her from Perpetrator 1's sexual abuse while he was employed as a teacher at the School. The court also finds that Doe 3 failed to provide evidence that it did not have knowledge of Perpetrator 1's alleged abuse. The motion is denied as to the remaining causes of action, including negligence, negligent failure to warn, train, or educate, and negligence per se.
