 On June 6, 2024, Plaintiff Yuyuan Gao filled the operative Complaint against Defendant Payward, Inc. for (1) fraudulent misrepresentation, (2) negligent misrepresentation, (3) aiding and abetting fraud, (4) negligence, (5) breach of fiduciary duty, (6) breach of contract, (7) breach of implied warranty of fitness for particular purpose, (8) breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, (9) violations of the UCL, (10) conversion, (11) unjust enrichment, (12) violations of the CLRA, (13) violations of the Financial Information Privacy Act, (14) intentional infliction of emotional distress (“IIED”), and (15) negligent infliction of emotional distress (“NIED”).Plaintiff alleges that he lost $48,935 after he “was approached by individuals (herein, ‘scammers’) who represented that they would invest PLAINTIFF’S money in cryptocurrency if he used DEFENDANT’S platform to first co[n]vert fiat currency to cryptocurrency and then, secondly, used DEFENDANT’S service to transfer the cryptocurrency to ‘digital wallets’ belonging to the scammers. DEFENDANTS use their platforms to attract both predators and prey. Instead of using their position to know-their-customers and prevent scams and money laundering, DEFENDANTS proceed to operate a haven to induce transfers and then parasitically profiteer off of the many illicit exchanges occurring on their platform.”DemurrerDefendant now demurs to the entirety of the Complaint for uncertainty and failure to state sufficient facts. When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context, and “treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Serrano v. Priest (1971) 5 Cal.3d 584, 591.)  “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.”  (Hahn v. Mirda¿(2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)  It is error “to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if the plaintiff shows there is a reasonable possibility any defect identified by the defendant can be cured by amendment.”  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist.¿(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)Fraud Claims“The elements of fraud, which give rise to the tort action for deceit, are (a) misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b) knowledge of falsity (or ‘scienter’); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage.”  (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 638, internal quotation marks omitted.) “[F]raud must be pled specifically; general and conclusory allegations do not suffice. [Citations] Thus the policy of liberal construction of the pleadings . . . will not ordinarily be invoked to sustain a pleading defective in any material respect.  This particularity requirement necessitates pleading facts which show how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were tendered.”  (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645, internal quotation marks omitted.) “Negligent misrepresentation is a form of deceit, the elements of which consist of (1) a misrepresentation of a past or existing material fact, (2) without reasonable grounds for believing it to be true, (3) with intent to induce another's reliance on the fact misrepresented, (4) ignorance of the truth and justifiable reliance thereon by the party to whom the misrepresentation was directed, and (5) damages.”  (Fox v. Pollack (1986) 181 Cal. App. 3d 954, 962.)A negligent misrepresentation claim should also be pleaded with specificity.  (Charnay v. Cobert (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 170, 185, fn. 14.) A finder of fact may determine a party aided and abetted a tort where it determines: (1) that the defendant knew a tort was or would be committed by a primary tortfeasor; (2) that the defendant gave substantial assistance or encouragement to the tortfeasor; and (3) that the defendant’s conduct was a substantial factor in causing harm to the plaintiff.  (CACI No. 3610.)Here, the fraud claims are not specifically pleaded.  The Complaint merely states that “DEFENDANTS, by allowing transfers to the scammer's wallet without adequate warnings or safeguards, engaged in a deceptive practice that induced PLAINTIFF to act to his detriment.”  There are hardly any facts provided.  The Opposition contends that concealment has been pleaded, despite that Plaintiff labels his claims as affirmative misrepresentations.  As an initial matter, a negligent omission is not an actionable form of deceit.   (RSB Vineyards, LLC v. Orsi (2017) 15 Cal.App.5th 1089, 1102.)  Second, even if the first cause of action relates to concealment, there are not sufficient facts indicating intent.  The Complaint indicates that Defendant knew the “scammers” were operating illegally because of the volume of their transfers.  This alone is insufficient.  Plaintiff also alleges that Defendant continues to facilitate transfers to the scammers, but fails to provide any facts as to these transfers. The Demurrer is sustained as to the first three causes of action.  Leave to amend is denied as to the second cause of action.  The Court is inclined to deny leave to amend as to the first and third causes of action.Negligence & NIEDNegligence requires duty, breach of duty, proximate causation, and damages.  (N.N.V. v. American Assn. of Blood Banks (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 1358, 1402.) There is no independent cause of action for NIED; rather, NIED is simply a claim for negligence.  (Burgess v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.4th 1064, 1072 [“We have repeatedly recognized that ‘[t]he negligent causing of emotional distress is not an independent tort, but the tort of negligence.’ ”].)   Further, “[i]n the absence of physical injury or impact to the plaintiff himself, damages for emotional distress should be recoverable only if the plaintiff: (1) is closely related to the injury victim; (2) is present at the scene of the injury-producing event at the time it occurs and is then aware that it is causing injury to the victim and, (3) as a result suffers emotional distress beyond that which would be anticipated in a disinterested witness.”  (Thing v. La Chusa (1989) 48 Cal. 3d 644, 647.)  As an initial matter, Plaintiff has utterly failed to plead emotional distress as a result of negligent conduct.  There is no physical injury to Plaintiff or a closely related victim.  Thus, the Demurrer is sustained as to the NIED claim, without leave to amend.As to ordinary negligence, the general rule in California is that every person is liable for an injury occasioned to another by his or her want of ordinary care or skill.  (Civ. Code § 1714.)  “A departure from this fundamental principle involves the balancing of a number of considerations; the major ones are the foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff, the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury, the closeness of the connection between the defendant's conduct and the injury suffered, the moral blame attached to the defendant's conduct, the policy of preventing future harm, the extent of the burden to the defendant and consequences to the community of imposing a duty to exercise care with resulting liability for breach, and the availability, cost, and prevalence of insurance for the risk involved.”  (Rowland v. Christian (1968) 69 Cal. 2d 108, 112–13.)Defendant’s briefing has not dispositively established a lack of duty at this juncture.  The issue of duty may involve factual issues as to the commercially reasonable precautions that can be taken and the relative harms and burdens between the parties.   Defendant also argues that negligence is barred by the economic loss rule.  “That judicially created doctrine bars recovery in negligence for pure economic losses when such claims would disrupt the parties’ private ordering, render contracts less reliable as a means of organizing commercial relationships, and stifle the development of contract law.”  (Sheen v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2022) 12 Cal.5th 905, 915.)  In one context, “the rule functions to bar claims in negligence for pure economic losses in deference to a contract between litigating parties.”  (Id. at p. 922.)  “Not all tort claims for monetary losses between contractual parties are barred by the economic loss rule. But such claims are barred when they arise from — or are not independent of — the parties’ underlying contracts. (See Robinson, supra, 34 Cal.4th at p. 991, 22 Cal.Rptr.3d 352, 102 P.3d 268 [holding that ‘the economic loss rule does not bar [the plaintiff's] fraud and intentional misrepresentation claims because they were independent of [the defendant's] breach of contract’]; Erlich, supra, 21 Cal.4th at pp. 551, 552, 87 Cal.Rptr.2d 886, 981 P.2d 978 [explaining that ‘[t]ort damages have been permitted in contract cases’ when ‘the duty that gives rise to tort liability is either completely independent of the contract or arises from conduct which is both intentional and intended to harm’].)”  (Id. at pp. 923–24.)Here, the parties’ relationship seems to be based on contract, and the Complaint fails to plead intentional conduct.  Thus, it appears that the economic loss rule would preclude recovery for what would be negligent performance of the contract at issue.  It is not clear what independent duty exists.  Plaintiff contends that there is a special relationship between the exchange and its customers, but, again, that relationship seems to be entirely a product of contract.  The Demurrer is sustained.  The Court is inclined to deny leave to amend.Breach of Fiduciary Duty“The elements of a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty are: (1) the existence of a fiduciary duty; (2) the breach of that duty; and (3) damage proximately caused by that breach. [Citation.]” (Mosier v. Southern Cal. Physicians Ins. Exchange (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1022, 1044.)“A fiduciary or confidential relationship can arise when confidence is reposed by persons in the integrity of others, and if the latter voluntarily accept or assume to accept the confidence, they cannot act so as to take advantage of the others' interests without their knowledge or consent.”  (Tri-Growth Ctr. City, Ltd. v. Silldorf, Burdman, Duignan & Eisenberg (1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 1139, 1150.)Plaintiff has failed to cite facts or authority supporting a fiduciary duty between a crypto exchange and its customers.  The Demurrer is sustained, without leave to amend.Contract ClaimsIn order to make out a cause of action for breach of contract, the complaint must allege: (a) the existence of a contract; (b) plaintiff's performance or excuse for non-performance; (c) defendant's breach; and (d) damages to plaintiff.  (First Coml. Mortgage v. Reece (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 731, 745.)  Moreover, “[t]he essential elements of a contract are: parties capable of contracting; the parties' consent; a lawful object; and sufficient cause or consideration.  (Lopez v. Charles Schwab & Co. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 1224, 1229–30.)The contract-based claims—causes of action 6-8—fail because Plaintiff failed to plead the material terms of the contract at issue or to attach the contract.  (See, e.g., Miles v. Deutsche Bank Nat'l Trust Co. (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 394, 402.)  The Demurrer is sustained, with 20 days leave to amend.ConversionThe elements of a conversion claim are: (1) the plaintiff's ownership or right to possession of the property; (2) the defendant's conversion by a wrongful act or disposition of property rights; and (3) damages.  (Burlesci v. Petersen (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 1062, 1066.)  Plaintiff alleges that “DEFENDANTS wrongfully interfered with PLAINTIFF’S right to possess these funds by allowing their transfer to the scammer's wallet without authorization.”It is difficult to see how Defendant interfered with Plaintiff’s possession of his money when it was Plaintiff that sought to complete the transaction and it was Defendant that merely facilitated it.  Plaintiff has failed to cite any authority in which conversion has been found because fraud-prevention actions were not taken.  On the contrary, “[C]onversion requires affirmative action to deprive another of property, not a lack of action.”  (Archer v. Coinbase, Inc. (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 266, 276.)  Liability lies with the “scammers.”  The Demurrer is sustained as to the conversion claim, without leave to amend.Unjust Enrichment“Unjust enrichment is not a cause of action, however, or even a remedy, but rather a general principle, underlying various legal doctrines and remedies .... [Citation.] It is synonymous with restitution. [Citation.] (Melchior v. New Line Productions, Inc. (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 779, 793, 131 Cal.Rptr.2d 347.) Unjust enrichment has also been characterized as describing the result of a failure to make restitution.... (Dunkin, supra, 82 Cal.App.4th at p. 198, fn. 15, 98 Cal.Rptr.2d 44, quoting Lauriedale Associates, Ltd. v. Wilson (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1439, 1448, 9 Cal.Rptr.2d 774 (Lauriedale ).)  [¶] There are several potential bases for a cause of action seeking restitution. For example, restitution may be awarded in lieu of breach of contract damages when the parties had an express contract, but it was procured by fraud or is unenforceable or ineffective for some reason. (See generally 3 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1996) Actions, §§ 148–150, pp. 218–220; 1 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1987) Contracts, §§ 112, 118, pp. 137–138, 142–144.) Alternatively, restitution may be awarded where the defendant obtained a benefit from the plaintiff by fraud, duress, conversion, or similar conduct. In such cases, the plaintiff may choose not to sue in tort, but instead to seek restitution on a quasi-contract theory (an election referred to at common law as waiving the tort and suing in assumpsit).”  (McBride v. Boughton (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 379, 387–89 (internal quotes omitted).)The Court may allow the unjust enrichment claim to move forward as a potential alternative to a breach of contract claim; however, until further facts are pleaded with respect to Defendant’s contractual promises, the viability of such a claim is somewhat uncertain.  Thus, the Demurrer is sustained as to the unjust enrichment claim, with 20 days leave to amend.CLRAThe CLRA, which is codified in Civ. Code §§ 1750-1784, protects individuals engaging in consumer transactions.  It prohibits “unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices undertaken by any person in a transaction intended to result or which results in the sale or lease of goods or services to any consumer.”  (Civ. Code § 1770(a).)  It sets forth 27 different “unfair or deceptive acts or practices” that may constitute a violation of the act.  (Ibid.)  In assessing whether the representations made in the course of the consumer transaction violate the CLRA, courts use the reasonable consumer standard—i.e., whether a reasonable consumer would be misled by the representation.  (Consumer Advocates v. Echostar Satellite Corp. (2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 1351, 1360.)  Here, the CLRA claim fails because cryptocurrency and the exchange services that surround them pertain to an intangible good that is not encompassed by the statute. (See Lu v. Enigma MPC, Inc. (N.D. Cal. Dec. 1, 2023) 2023 WL 8360052, at *5; In re Ethereummax Inv. Litig., 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 220968, *49; Suski v. Marden-Kane, Inc., 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157448, *23.)  The Demurrer is sustained as to the CLRA claim, without leave to amend.Financial Information Privacy ActThe FIPA claim fails because there is no private right of action for such a claim.  “The issue in a case such as this is primarily one of legislative intent. If the Legislature intended a private right of action, that usually ends the inquiry. If the Legislature intended there be no private right of action, that usually ends the inquiry. If we determine the Legislature expressed no intent on the matter either way, directly or impliedly, there is no private right of action (Moradi–Shalal v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Companies (1988) 46 Cal.3d 287, 305, 250 Cal.Rptr. 116, 758 P.2d 58 (Moradi–Shalal)), with the possible exception that compelling reasons of public policy might require judicial recognition of such a right. (See id. at pp. 304–305, 250 Cal.Rptr. 116, 758 P.2d 58; see also Katzberg v. Regents of University of California (2002) 29 Cal.4th 300, 317, 127 Cal.Rptr.2d 482, 58 P.3d 339 [considerations for judicial recognition of private right of action for constitutional violations].)”  (Id. at p. 142.)FIPA and its legislative history are silent on this issue and nothing therein has been cited to impliedly support a private right; therefore, the Demurrer is sustained as to the thirteenth of action, without leave to amend. IIEDThe elements of the tort of IIED are: “(1) extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendant with the intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of causing, emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff’s suffering severe or extreme emotional distress; and (3) actual and proximate causation of the emotional distress by the defendant’s outrageous conduct. . . . Conduct to be outrageous must be so extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized community.”  (Christensen v. Superior Court (1991) 54 Cal.3d 868, 903, internal quotations omitted.)  Liability does not extend to mere insults, indignities, threats, annoyances, petty oppressions, or other trivialities.  (Molko v. Holy Spirit Assn. (1986) 46 Cal.3d 1092, 1122.)Here, the Complaint fails to allege intentional conduct designed to or likely to cause emotional distress.  The Complaint only provides facts approaching negligent conduct in precluding fraudulent transactions on Defendant’s platform.  The Demurrer is sustained as to the fourteenth cause of action, without leave to amend.UCL“The UCL defines ‘unfair competition’ as ‘any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising.’ (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17200)”  (Yanting Zhang v. Superior Court (2013) 57 Cal. 4th 364, 370.)  A UCL action “ ‘is not an all-purpose substitute for a tort or contract action.’ [Citation.] Instead, the act provides an equitable means through which both public prosecutors and private individuals can bring suit to prevent unfair business practices and restore money or property to victims of these practices.... [T]he ‘overarching legislative concern [was] to provide a streamlined procedure for prevention of ongoing or threatened acts of unfair competition.’ ” (Korea Supply Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp. (2003) 29 Cal.4th 1134, 1150.)  “As a result, the remedies available to private individuals for violation of the UCL are limited to restitution and injunctive relief; damages cannot be recovered.” (Graham v. Bank of Am., N.A. (2014) 226 Cal. App. 4th 594, 610.)Because the statute “is written in the disjunctive, it establishes three varieties of unfair competition—acts or practices which are unlawful, or unfair, or fraudulent.”  (Cel–Tech Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 163, 180.)  “By proscribing ‘any unlawful’ business act or practice [citation], the UCL ‘ “borrows” ’ rules set out in other laws and makes violations of those rules independently actionable. [Citation]”  (Yanting Zhang v. Superior Court (2013) 57 Cal. 4th 364, 370.)  A “violation of another law is a predicate for stating a cause of action under the UCL's unlawful prong.” (Berryman v. Merit Property Management, Inc. (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 1544, 1554.)  Because a UCL claim is derivative and all of Plaintiff’s claims failed, the Demurrer is sustained as to the UCL claim.  The Court is inclined to deny leave to amend as it is likely that only contract claims will be amended.Summary  In sum, the Demurrer is sustained.  The Court grants 20 days leave to amend as to causes of action 6-8 and 11.  Leave to amend is otherwise denied. Motion to Strike Defendant also seeks to strike the Complaint’s references to punitive damages.Motions to strike are used to challenge defects in the pleadings not subject to demurrer.  Any party may move to strike the whole or any part of a pleading within the time allotted to respond to the pleading.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 435(b)(1).)  The grounds for a motion to strike shall appear on the face of the challenged pleading or from any matter of which the Court is required to take judicial notice.  (Id. § 437(a).)  The Court may strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading, and strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.  (Id. § 436.)  An “irrelevant” matter includes any “demand for judgment requesting relief not supported by the allegations of the complaint or cross-complaint.”  (Id. § 431.10(b)(3), (c); see also Smith v. Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1033, 1036-1042.) The Motion to Strike is granted because Plaintiff has failed to plead malicious, oppressive, or fraudulent conduct.  (Civ. Code § 3294.)  Leave to amend is denied. Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
