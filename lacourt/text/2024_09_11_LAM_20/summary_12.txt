And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English:

The Judge has ruled on the Demurrer and Motion to Strike filed by the Defendant. The Judge has sustained the Demurrer as to the first three causes of action, including fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and aiding and abetting fraud, finding that the Complaint fails to plead specific facts and intent. The Judge has also sustained the Demurrer as to the claims of negligence, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and intentional infliction of emotional distress, finding that the Complaint fails to plead emotional distress and the necessary elements of these claims.

The Judge has granted 20 days leave to amend as to causes of action 6-8 and 11, which relate to breach of contract, breach of implied warranty, and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The Judge has denied leave to amend as to the first and third causes of action.

The Judge has also granted the Motion to Strike, finding that the Plaintiff has failed to plead malicious, oppressive, or fraudulent conduct, which is necessary to support a claim for punitive damages.

Overall, the Judge has rejected most of the Plaintiff's claims and has given the Plaintiff an opportunity to amend its Complaint to address the deficiencies identified by the Judge.
