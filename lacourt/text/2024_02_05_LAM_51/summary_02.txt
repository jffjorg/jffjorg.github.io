Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

In this tentative ruling, the court addresses several issues related to the Eleventh Cause of Action, including whether the statute of limitations bars the plaintiff's claim and whether the plaintiff adequately alleged that MTV had the specific intent to facilitate any wrongful conduct. The court notes that MTV relies on a District Court opinion in Doe v. Neverson (2023) WL 9375100, but finds it neither binding nor persuasive. The court also notes that the plaintiff did not directly address MTV's argument and declines to develop the argument further.
