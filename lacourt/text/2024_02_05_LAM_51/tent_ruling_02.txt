MTV relies on Doe v. Neverson (2023) WL 9375100, a District Court opinion which
is neither binding nor persuasive on this court. Still, the court there noted
that the plaintiff was limited to the ten-year limitations period because there
were “no allegation[s] that evidence was hidden, that nondisclosure agreements
were sought, or that confidentiality agreements were reached.” The court also
noted that the plaintiff alleged the abuser’s behavior was public knowledge.
