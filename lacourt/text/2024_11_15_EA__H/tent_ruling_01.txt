One Bank (USA), N.A. v. Lu, Case No. 19PSCV00420
Plaintiff Capital One Bank (USA),
Inc.’s Motion to Vacate Dismissal and Enter Judgment Under Terms of Stipulated Settlement
is DENIED without prejudice. 
Background 
This
is a credit card collection case. On May 6, 2019, Plaintiff Capital One Bank (USA), Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint,
asserting causes of action against Jiazheng Lu (“Lu”) for breach of contract
and common counts. 
On
October 15, 2019, Plaintiff filed a “Settlement Agreement.” On October 16,
2019, Plaintiff filed a conditional “Notice of Settlement of Entire Case;” that
day, an “Order on Settlement Agreement and Stipulation for Judgment” was filed,
and the case was dismissed, without prejudice.
Legal
Standard
“If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing
signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally before the
court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may
enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the
parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the
settlement until performance in full of the terms of the settlement.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (a).)
 
Discussion
Plaintiff moves the Court for an
order, per Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6, vacating the dismissal in
this case and entering judgment against Lu.

As a preliminary matter, the Court grants Plaintiff’s
Request for Judicial Notice as to the existence and filing date (i.e., October
15, 2019) of the Settlement Agreement.
Turning to the merits, the Court notes at the
outset that the notice of motion references a “settlement sum of $35,400.00,”[FN1] whereas the proposed judgment is for $89,677.83 (i.e., principal sum of
$88,668.33 plus costs of $1,009.50). The notice of motion is deficient in this
regard.
On or about August 23, 2019, the parties entered
into the Settlement Agreement, wherein Lu stipulated to entry of judgment in
Plaintiff’s favor in the principal sum of $118,828.33 plus court costs pursuant
to a memorandum of costs, less credit for payments made before the time of
default. (Langedyk Decl., ¶ 2, Exh. B, ¶ 1.) It was also agreed therein that
Plaintiff would not request that the above judgment be entered so long as Lu
was not in default with a payment plan wherein he would pay Plaintiff
$118,828.33 payable at $590.00/month on or before the 13th day of each month
commencing in September 2019, followed by a final payment of $238.33 due on or
before June 13, 2036. (Id., ¶ 2, Exh. B, ¶ 3.)
It was agreed that, if Lu defaulted in making any
payment due to Plaintiff, Plaintiff would provide Lu with 10 days written
notice, served to Lu via mail at 4158 14th Street Riverside, CA 92501 (“or as
corrected by [Lu] at the time of signing this stipulation”), of its intent to
apply to the Court to have the dismissal set aside and vacated and to have
judgment entered under the terms of the stipulation. (Id., ¶ 2, Exh. B, ¶ 11). It was
agreed that said notice would not give Lu a right to cure the default, but
would “provide[] only an opportunity for Defendant to appear and offer evidence
that there has been no default.” (Id., ¶ 2, Exh. B, ¶ 12.) The Settlement Agreement
contained a section 664.6 clause. (Id., ¶ 2, Exh. B, ¶ 7.)
On
October 16, 2019, the case was dismissed, without prejudice. (Id., ¶ 4.) Lu has defaulted on the payment arrangement set forth in the
Settlement Agreement; the last payment from Lu was received on December 13,
2023. (Id., ¶ 5.) Lu has paid a total of $30,160.00. (Id., ¶ 7.)
The
motion is denied without prejudice. Although Langedyk represents that Lu “was provided with 10-days written
notice of the failure to make agreed upon payments and Plaintiff’s intention to
request entry of judgment under terms of the Stipulation Agreement, a copy of
which is attached hereto and marked Exhibit ‘A’” (Id., ¶ 6), Exhibit A reflects
that it was mailed to Lu at 17585 Railroad St., City of Industry, CA
91748-1125,” rather than to 4158 14th
Street Riverside, CA 92501, as set forth in Paragraph 11 of the Settlement
Agreement. Further, there is no indication that Lu made any “correct[ion]” to
this address at the time of signing the Settlement Agreement, as provided for
in Paragraph 11.
