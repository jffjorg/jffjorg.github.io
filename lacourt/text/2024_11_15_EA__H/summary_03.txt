The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrers to the Cross-Complaint filed by SA Hospital Acquisition Group, LLC, et al. against B.R. Building Resources Company. The Court has sustained the demurrers, meaning that the allegations in the Cross-Complaint do not provide sufficient facts to support a cause of action.

The Court has dismissed the second, third, and fifth causes of action in the Cross-Complaint, which alleged fraud, concealment, and conversion, respectively. The Court has also dismissed the fourth cause of action, which sought an accounting.

The Court has granted the defendants 20 days' leave to amend the Cross-Complaint to cure the defects identified by the Court. The Court has declined to strike the Cross-Complaint, which was requested by the plaintiff.

The case involves a dispute over the alleged diversion of funds for construction projects at South City Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri. The defendants allegedly mishandled and misallocated the funds, and the plaintiff seeks to recover damages. The Court has ruled that the allegations in the Cross-Complaint are insufficient to support a cause of action and have granted the defendants leave to amend the Cross-Complaint.
