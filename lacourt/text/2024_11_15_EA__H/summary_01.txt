And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Capital One Bank's (USA), Inc.'s motion to vacate the dismissal of the case and enter judgment under the terms of the stipulated settlement. The case is a credit card collection matter, and the parties entered into a settlement agreement on August 23, 2019, which included a provision for judgment to be entered if the defendant, Jiazheng Lu, defaulted on the payment arrangement. Lu has defaulted on the payments, and the last payment was made on December 13, 2023. The notice of motion references a settlement sum of $35,400.00, but the proposed judgment is for $89,677.83. The judge notes that the notice of motion is deficient in this regard.

The judge also notes that the address listed in the settlement agreement for Lu is incorrect, and that Lu did not correct this address at the time of signing the agreement. The judge concludes that the motion is denied without prejudice, meaning that the parties can re-file the motion and present additional evidence to support their claims.
