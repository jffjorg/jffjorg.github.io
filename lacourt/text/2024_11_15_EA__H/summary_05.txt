And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer to the cross-complaint filed by SA Hospital Entities, Lawrence Feigen, and Jeffrey Ahlholm against B.R. Building Resources Company. The cross-complaint alleges that B.R. failed to make payments under equipment leases, and that it mishandled and misallocated construction funds. The judge found that the cross-complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute causes of action for fraud, accounting, and conversion. The judge granted the cross-complainants 20 days' leave to amend their pleading.
