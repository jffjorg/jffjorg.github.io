And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendant Arnulfo Solis Bermejo to the complaint filed by Plaintiff Sergio Antonio Aceves Cisneros. The complaint alleges that Defendant was negligent and caused a motor vehicle accident, resulting in injuries to the Plaintiff. The judge has found that the complaint states sufficient facts to set forth a cause of action for negligence and is not uncertain or ambiguous. Therefore, the judge has overruled the demurrer and ordered the Defendant to file and serve a responsive pleading within 30 days. The judge has also set a final status conference and trial dates.
