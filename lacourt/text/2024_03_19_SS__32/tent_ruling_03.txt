MOTION
 
On July 23, 2021, Plaintiff Sergio Antonio Aceves Cisneros (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against Defendants Mark Mcintosh and Does 1 to 50 for negligence
surrounding a motor vehicle accident. 
 
            On October 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed
an amendment to the complaint substituting Arnulfo Solis Bermejo as Doe 2. 
 
Defendant Arnulfo Solis Bermejo (“Defendant”) now demurs to the complaint
for failing to state facts to constitute a cause of action and for uncertainty.
Plaintiff opposes and Defendant replies. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
A demurrer is a pleading used to
test the legal sufficiency of other pleadings. 
It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or content of the
opposing party's pleading (complaint, answer or cross-complaint).  (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 422.10, 589; see Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  It is not the function of the demurrer to
challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for purposes of the ruling on
the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are assumed to be true.  (Donabedian, 116 Cal.App.4th at 994.)
 
The general rule is that the plaintiff need only allege
ultimate facts, not evidentiary facts. (Doe v. City of Los Angeles
(2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550.) “All that is required of a plaintiff, as a matter
of pleading, even as against a special demurrer, is that his complaint set
forth the essential facts of the case with reasonable precision and with
sufficient particularity to acquaint the defendant with the nature, source and
extent of his cause of action.” (Rannard v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp. (1945) 26 Cal.2d 149,
156-157.) 
 
On demurrer, a trial court has an independent duty to
“determine whether or not the … complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a
cause of action under any legal theory.” (Das v. Bank of America, N.A.
(2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 727, 734.) Demurrers do not lie as to only parts of
causes of action, where some valid claim is alleged but “must dispose of an
entire cause of action to be sustained.” (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp.
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119.)
 
A
demurrer for uncertainty will be sustained only where the pleading is so bad
that the responding party cannot reasonably respond, i.e., he or she cannot
reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what claims are
directed against him or her. (Khoury v. Maly’s of California (1993) 14
Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) Where a demurrer is made upon the ground of uncertainty,
the demurrer must distinctly specify exactly how or why the pleading is
uncertain, and where such uncertainty appears by reference to page and line
numbers. (See Fenton v. Groveland Comm. Services Dist. (1982) 135
Cal.App.3d 797, 809.)
 
            Where a demurrer is sustained, leave
to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976)
18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to show the court that a
pleading can be amended successfully. (Id.;
Lewis v. YouTube, LLC (2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) However, “[i]f
there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause
of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).  
 
MEET
AND CONFER
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41 requires that “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this
chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone
with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the
purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve
the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd.
(a).) The parties are to meet and confer at least five days before the date the
responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(2).)
Thereafter, the demurring party shall file and serve a declaration detailing
their meet and confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(3).)
 
According to the Declaration of Defendant,
it does not appear that Defendant attempted to meet and confer with Plaintiff’s
counsel prior to filing this demurrer. (See Bermejo Decl.) Nevertheless, “[a]
determination by the court that the meet and confer process was insufficient
shall not be grounds to overrule or sustain a demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
430.41 (a)(4).)
 
ANALYSIS
 
The elements of a
cause of action for negligence are: (1) a duty on the part of defendant toward
plaintiff; (2) defendant’s breach of that duty; and (3) harm to the plaintiff
caused by that breach. (Kesner
v. Superior Court (2016)
1 Cal.5th 1132, 1142.)
 
Here,
the complaint alleges that on August 30, 2019, at Long Beach Boulevard near
Hill Street, Long Beach, California, “the defendant and each of them
named in the complaint, the defendant and each of them named did not exercise
ordinary care, caution or prudence to avoid or prevent said accident and
injuries sustained by plaintiffs were actually and proximately caused by said
fault, carelessness and negligence of defendants and each of them named in the
complaint.” (Complaint, 5.) The Complaint also alleges that Doe Defendants 1–6
were the agents or employees of other named defendants and acted within the scope
of that agency or employment. (Id. ¶ 6a.) 
 
Defendant sets forth extrinsic evidence to support that
he is not liable for the allegations in the complaint. However, at the demurrer
stage, the Court must assume the truth of the complaint, and only look at the
face of the complaint and any matters judicially noticed. Therefore, looking at
the face of the complaint, the Court cannot conclude as a matter of law that
Defendant is not liable. Additionally, the complaint appears to set forth sufficient
allegations of the elements for negligence and is not so uncertain that
Defendant cannot reasonably respond. 
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court OVERRULES Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s complaint.
Defendant shall file and serve a responsive pleading within 30 days. 
 
The Court sets a Final Status Conference for July 15, 2024 at 10:00
a.m. in Department 32 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
 
Trial is set for July 29, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 32 of the Spring
Street Courthouse.
 
Defendant shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
