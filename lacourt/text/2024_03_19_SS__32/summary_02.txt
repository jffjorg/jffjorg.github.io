  - Defendant: Gevorg Nersisyan
  - Judge: N/A
Significant Statements:
  - "The party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law."
  - "The court's task is not to decide whether a particular plaintiff's injury was reasonably foreseeable in light of a particular defendant's conduct, but rather to evaluate more generally whether the category of negligent conduct at issue is sufficiently likely to result in the kind of harm experienced that liability may appropriately be imposed on the negligent party."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court has considered the motion for summary judgment brought by Defendant Gevorg Nersisyan and has denied the motion. The court finds that there are triable issues of fact regarding all elements of negligence, including whether Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty of care and whether Defendant's conduct was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiff's injury. The court concludes that Defendant has failed to meet his initial burden of establishing the absence of a triable issue of fact. The motion for summary judgment is denied.
