And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion to consolidate four cases for all purposes. The cases, 22STCV36104, 22STCV36727, 23STCV03426, and 23STCV04630, all arise out of the same incident where an LED wall fell on attendees at the Move for MDS Walk in Griffith Park, Los Angeles on August 28, 2022. The plaintiffs in each case allege injuries caused by the falling LED wall. The court finds that the cases involve common questions of law and fact and grants the motion to consolidate, citing the purpose of consolidation to avoid unnecessary costs or delay, duplication of procedure, and inconsistent results. The court orders that all future papers be filed in case 22STCV36104 only and that all future hearings be scheduled in that case only.
