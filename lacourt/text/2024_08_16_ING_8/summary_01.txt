```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to compel and sanctions. The motions to compel were mooted by the defendant's service of verified responses to the discovery requests. However, the request for sanctions is not moot and the court will not award the excessive amount sought by the plaintiffs. Instead, the court will suggest referring the case to a discount mediation program if the parties cannot resolve the sanctions issue. The judge notes that the defendant has served verified, amended responses to the discovery requests and has provided verifications for each previously served response. The court will not award monetary sanctions, but will instead refer the parties to a mediation program to resolve the issue.
