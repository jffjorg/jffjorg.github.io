And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Omar Garcia v. General Motors, LLC, et al. The case concerns a motion to compel the deposition of General Motors' Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK) and a request for production of documents.

The judge has granted the motion to compel the deposition of the PMK, but denied the motion to compel the production of the requested documents. The judge found that the plaintiff's attorney had sufficiently attempted to meet and confer with the defendant's attorney prior to bringing the motion.

The judge also imposed a monetary sanction of $1500 to be payable by General Motors or its counsel to the plaintiff's counsel within 30 days.

The judge's decision is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and the California Rules of Court. The judge noted that the defendant failed to respond to the plaintiff's meet and confer letters and failed to provide objections to the deposition notice.

The case is still pending, and the judge's tentative ruling is subject to change after the parties have had an opportunity to file objections and briefs.
