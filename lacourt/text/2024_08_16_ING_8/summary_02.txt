As for the summary of the tentative ruling in English text, here it is:

The tentative ruling holds that the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint is overruled as to the first and second causes of action, sustained with twenty (20) days leave to amend as to the third cause of action, and overruled as to the fourth and fifth causes of action. The plaintiff's complaint alleges breach of contract, breach of guaranty, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and declaratory relief. The defendants argued that the plaintiff's complaint is uncertain and fails to state a cause of action, but the court found that the allegations are sufficient to state a cause of action for breach of contract and breach of guaranty. The court also found that the declaratory relief causes of action are not redundant and may be advanced either alone or with other relief.
