And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and appoint a guardian ad litem for the plaintiff, Emely Janeth Martin Regalo, is continued. The court has set an order to show cause (OSC) for September 3, 2024, at 9:00 am to determine why a guardian ad litem should not be appointed for the plaintiff.

The defendants have brought a motion to compel arbitration based on an agreement executed by the plaintiff on December 21, 2020, and a motion to appoint a guardian ad litem due to a judicial finding that the plaintiff was incompetent to stand trial in a criminal case filed against her in April 2023.

The judge has considered the defendants' arguments and has found that it is proper to consider their request for an appointed guardian ad litem prior to their request to compel arbitration. The judge has also noted that the applicable standards for determining mental competency in civil proceedings are the same as those used in criminal proceedings.

The plaintiff has opposed the defendants' motions, arguing that the findings of incompetency in the criminal case are inapplicable to the present civil case. However, the judge has found that the standards for determining mental competency are the same in both criminal and civil proceedings, and that the plaintiff's capacity to prosecute the action is relevant to the defendants' motion to compel arbitration.

The judge has given the plaintiff an opportunity to explain what has changed in the intervening months since the criminal court's competency determination, and has set the OSC for September 3, 2024, to determine why a guardian ad litem should not be appointed for the plaintiff. The defendants' motion to appoint a guardian ad litem is continued to that date, and the motion to compel arbitration shall be scheduled thereafter.
