The Judge has also taken off-calendar the Plaintiff's pending motions to compel further responses to requests for production, requests for admission, and interrogatories. The Judge's decision is based on the parties' construction contract, which contains a provision for the appointment of a referee, and the California Code of Civil Procedure. The Judge has also considered the Plaintiff's arguments that the reference agreement is unconscionable and that it should be permitted to withdraw from the agreement, but has found these arguments to be without merit.
