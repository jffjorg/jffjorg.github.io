And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge granted the motion for leave to amend, allowing the plaintiffs to add Quest National Holdings as a defendant and add a cause of action for negligent hiring, supervision, or retention of employee. The motion was granted due to the lack of opposition and the liberal standard in favor of leave to amend. The plaintiffs are ordered to file a separate copy of their amended complaint within ten days, and the defendants must file responsive pleadings within twenty days. If the defendants do not file responsive pleadings, their answers to the original complaint will be deemed their answers to the amended complaint.
