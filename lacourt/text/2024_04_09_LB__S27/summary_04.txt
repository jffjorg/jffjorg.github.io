And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the trial date will be continued for three months to Tuesday, September 3, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department S27. The Judge notes that the parties filed a stipulation to continue the trial date to 12/09/24, but the Court denied the stipulation because the stipulation is not permitted for use outside of the personal injury hub court system at the Spring Street Courthouse. The Judge is hopeful that the Plaintiff has complied with the 3/05/24 order requiring responses within fourteen days and that the scheduled 4/24/24 deposition will go forward. The Judge emphasizes that the Court will not permit Plaintiff to stonewall discovery and is setting the new trial date to give the parties sufficient time to complete discovery.
