And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is regarding a motion to expunge a mechanics lien filed by Leilani Lacusong. The lien was recorded on September 12, 2023, for renovation costs, sub-contractor costs, utilities, insurance, rent, security, lighting, mortgage, and taxes. The moving parties argue that the lien must be removed because some of the items listed are not proper subjects of a mechanics lien. The Judge finds that the burden to show the lien is proper is on the party opposing the motion to expunge, and since no opposition was filed in a timely manner, the motion to expunge is granted. The Judge declines to rule on additional arguments in support of the motion, but notes that they also appear to have merit.
