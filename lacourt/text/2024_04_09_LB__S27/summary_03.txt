The court has granted the Plaintiffs' motion for a protective order, finding that the Defendant's propounded interrogatories are excessive. The court finds that the Defendant failed to meet the burden of justifying the number of questions, and that the motion is warranted. The court also orders the Defendant and his attorney to pay sanctions in the amount of $4123.30 to the Plaintiffs.
