 Case Number:  23LBCV01016    Hearing Date:   April 9, 2024    Dept:  S27 1.     Background
Facts
Plaintiff, Eman Mahmoud filed this action against Defendants, Sally
Larson, et al. for damages arising out of a trip and fall.  The fall occurred on 6/04/21, and Plaintiff
filed the complaint on 6/01/23.   The case is scheduled for trial on 6/03/24.
 
2.     Motion
to Continue Trial 
Defendants propounded discovery on
Plaintiff on 10/26/23.  Plaintiff failed
to respond, and on 3/05/24, the Court granted Defendants’ motions to
compel.  Defendants scheduled Plaintiff’s
deposition for 2/15/24, but had to continue the deposition because of
Plaintiff’s failure to serve discovery responses.  The deposition is currently scheduled for
4/24/24.  
 
Defendants seek an order continuing
the trial date for an unspecified amount of time.  The Court notes that the parties filed a
stipulation to continue the trial date to 12/09/24; the Court denied the
stipulation because the stipulation is not permitted for use outside of the
personal injury hub court system at the Spring Street Courthouse.  In any event, the Court is not inclined to
continue the trial date for six months. 
The Court will not permit Plaintiff to stonewall discovery, and is
hopeful that Plaintiff has complied with the 3/05/24 order requiring responses
within fourteen days.  The Court is also
hopeful that the scheduled 4/24/24 deposition will go forward.  
 
The Court will continue the trial
date for three months, to Tuesday, 9/03/24 at 8:30 a.m. in Department S27.  The FSC is continued from 5/09/24 to
Thursday, 8/23/24 at 8:30 a.m.
 
Defendants are ordered to give
notice.
