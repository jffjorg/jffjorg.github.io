Summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to compel arbitration and stays the action pending completion of arbitration. The ruling is based on the arbitration provision in the Merchant Agreement, which delegates questions of arbitrability to the arbitrator. The Court finds that the delegation clause is enforceable and that all issues regarding the enforceability of the Arbitration Agreement are to be decided by the arbitrator. The ruling requires Defendants to give notice of the Court's ruling within five calendar days of the order.
