And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Frank Flores' motion for issue, evidentiary, and monetary sanctions in the amount of $811.65. The motion was unopposed, but the judge found it procedurally defective because it did not include a separate statement as required by California Rules of Court rule 3.1345, subdivision (a)(7). Additionally, the judge did not find that Plaintiff's failure to comply with discovery orders was a misuse of the discovery process, and instead suggested that Frank could have filed a motion to compel further responses to the Request for Production of Documents. The court ordered Frank to give notice of the ruling within five calendar days of the order.
