And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Ford Motor Credit Company's request for entry of default judgment against Arturo Solis without prejudice. The judge found that the plaintiff's default judgment package was otherwise in order, but there were some issues that needed to be addressed. Specifically, the plaintiff did not submit the request for entry of default judgment on Judicial Council Form CIV-105 as required by the California Rules of Court. Additionally, the declaration of George Galvez was ambiguous as to whether the copy of the contract submitted was an original or a copy, and the attorney fees calculation was slightly excessive. The judge also noted that the plaintiff as assignee of the original finance agreement from Bluesky Diversified Inc. did not explain why the original could not be produced. The judge has given the plaintiff an opportunity to correct these issues and resubmit its request for entry of default judgment.
