 Case Number:  24PSCV01565    Hearing Date:   October 3, 2024    Dept:  6 Plaintiff
Ford Motor Credit Company’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment 
Defendant: Arturo Solis 
TENTATIVE RULING           
Plaintiff’s request for entry of
default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.           
BACKGROUND           
            This
is a breach of contract case. On May 16, 2024, plaintiff Ford Motor Credit
Company (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendant Arturo Solis
(Defendant) and Does 1 through 10, alleging the sole cause of action for breach
of contract. On August 28, 2024, Plaintiff requested entry of default and
default judgment against Defendant.           
LEGAL
STANDARD 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party
has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party
seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court
Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other
admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest
computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration
of nonmilitary status; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all
parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate
judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for
attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.) 
ANALYSIS 
Plaintiff
seeks default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $112,418.53,
including $93,102.52 in damages, $16,047.30 in interest, $2,754.71 in attorney
fees, and $514.00 in costs. The Court finds Plaintiff’s default judgment
package is otherwise in order, except that Plaintiff, as assignee of the
original finance agreement from Bluesky Diversified Inc., did not submit the
request for entry of default judgment on Judicial Council Form CIV-105, as
required by Rule 3.1800, subdivision (a), of the California Rules of Court.
(Request for Entry of Default Judgment (8/28/24); Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800, subd. (a).) The Court also notes that the declaration of George Galvez
is ambiguous as to whether the copy of the contract submitted is an original or
a copy of the subject finance agreement. (Galvez Decl., ¶ 1 [“All of the
documents attached hereto are originals, or unaltered copies…”].) If the
original finance agreement is not attached, Plaintiff needs to explain why the
original could not be produced. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1806; Kahn
v. Lasorda’s Dugout, Inc. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 1118,
1123.) The Court also finds the attorney fees calculation to be slightly
excessive. The correct amount based on principal damages of $93,102.52 would be
$2,752.05, not $2,754.71 as requested. (Local Rule 3.214.) 
CONCLUSION           
            Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s request
for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
