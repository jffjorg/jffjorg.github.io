Bankers Healthcare Group, LLC’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment 
Defendant: Jessi P Changala 
COURT RULING           
Plaintiff’s request for entry of

directs Plaintiff to submit a revised proposed judgment correcting the defects
identified herein for the Court’s review and signature.           
BACKGROUND           
This is
a collection case. On October 23, 2023, plaintiff Bankers Healthcare Group, LLC
(Plaintiff) filed this action against defendant Jessi P Changala (Defendant)
and Does 1 through 10, alleging one cause of action for breach of contract. On September
12, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for entry of default and a default judgment
package.           
LEGAL
STANDARD 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party
has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party
seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court
Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other
admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest
computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a declaration
of military status; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all
parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate
judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for
attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.) 
ANALYSIS 
Plaintiff
seeks default judgment against Defendant in the total amount of $38,119.38,
including $35,750.63 in damages, $1,787.53 in attorney fees, and $581.22 in
costs. The Court finds Plaintiff’s default judgment package corrects the
defects the Court identified in Plaintiff’s prior default judgment packages,
but notes that the attorney fees calculation is overstated by $325.01, with the
correct total for attorney fees here being $1,462.52, i.e., 3% of $25,750.63 (excess
amount over $10,000), plus $690.00. (Local Rule 3.214.) The Court also notes
that the amount for attorney fees listed on the proposed judgment does not
match the amount stated in the request for entry of default judgment either.
(See Request for Entry of Default Judgment, ¶ 2, subd. (e); Proposed Judgment, p.
2.) Nevertheless, this can easily be remedied by Plaintiff submitting a new
proposed judgment containing the correct attorney fees amount noted herein. 
CONCLUSION           
Plaintiff’s request for entry of
default judgment is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $37,794.37. The Court directs
Plaintiff to submit a revised proposed judgment correcting the defects
identified herein for the Court’s review and signature.
