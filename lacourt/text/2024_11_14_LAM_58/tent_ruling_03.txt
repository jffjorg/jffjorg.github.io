[1] Even if Plaintiff is correct that the FAA does not
apply to the arbitration agreement with Defendants, this does not render the
Arbitration Agreement unenforceable based on the Court’s determination that
Labor Code section 432.6 does not apply to this Agreement. That is, a contract
to arbitrate does not require the FAA to be enforceable. Rather, the FAA only
preempts certain state laws that would otherwise prohibit arbitration. “Nothing
in the CAA, however, requires that an arbitration agreement explicitly reference
the CAA to be enforceable under California law.” (Garrido v. Air Liquide
Industrial U.S. LP (2015) 241 Cal.App.4th 833, 841; see also Lagatree
v. Luce, Forward, Hamilton & Scripps (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 1105, 1121
[“Assuming arguendo that the FAA does not apply, we would assess the validity
of the parties' arbitration agreements under the California Arbitration
Act.”].) Thus, the applicability of the FAA has no consequence here.

Defendants do not appear to be third party beneficiaries. To invoke the
third-party beneficiary exception, the nonsignatory “ ‘ha[s] to show that the
arbitration clause ... was made expressly for [its] benefit.’ ” (Fuentes,
supra, 26 Cal.App.5th at pp. 551–552, 237 Cal.Rptr.3d 256.) Here, the Arbitration
Agreement had its own list of intended third-party beneficiaries. Based on the
English language translation, the Agreement required arbitration of any
employment disputes between Plaintiff and CititStaff (which referred to “CitiStaff Solutions Inc.
and CitiStaff Management Group, Inc.”) and “current and former
agents, owners, officers, directors, or employees . . ..” (Cerdas Decl., ¶¶
5-6, Ex. A, ¶ 3; Slater Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. B, ¶ 3.) Here, Defendant CitiStaff repeatedly refers to non-moving
Defendants as “customers.”
