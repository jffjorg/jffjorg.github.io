And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses two key issues. Firstly, the judge holds that even if the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) does not apply to the arbitration agreement, this does not render the agreement unenforceable. The judge notes that a contract to arbitrate does not require the FAA to be enforceable, and that the FAA only preempts certain state laws that would otherwise prohibit arbitration.

Secondly, the judge rules that the non-moving defendants are not third-party beneficiaries of the arbitration agreement. The judge notes that the agreement explicitly identifies certain entities as intended third-party beneficiaries, and that the non-moving defendants are referred to as "customers" by the defendant CitiStaff, rather than being beneficiaries of the agreement. Therefore, the judge concludes that the third-party beneficiary exception does not apply.
