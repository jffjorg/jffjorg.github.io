And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's ex parte application to continue the trial to allow the court to hear their discovery motions and obtain further discovery. The defendant's application is based on their claim that the plaintiff did not respond to discovery requests, but the judge finds that the defendant is responsible for the lack of diligence in serving discovery at the last minute. The judge notes that the defendant served discovery with only a week to spare, leaving no room for error, and that even if they had brought a motion to compel, it would have been untimely. The judge also finds that the declaration in support of the application is insufficient and that the court will not hear argument on this matter. The trial is currently set for December 11, 2023.
