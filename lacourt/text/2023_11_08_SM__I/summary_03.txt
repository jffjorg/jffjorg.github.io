And here is the English summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses a demurrer filed by the defendant (cross-defendant) in a premises liability action brought by the plaintiff (cross-complainant). The cross-complaint seeks damages for the period after a prior unlawful detainer (UD) judgment. The Judge rules that the demurrer is overruled, citing the doctrine of claim preclusion, which bars parties from litigating piece-meal or splitting claims. The Judge notes that the res judicata argument could be brought again, but concludes that the doctrine of claim preclusion does not apply in this case due to the limited nature of a UD case. The Judge also considers the statute of limitations, finding that the cross-complaint is timely due to the doctrine of equitable tolling/relation back, which allows a late-filed cross-complaint to relate back to the date the complaint was filed. The Judge concludes that the demurrer is overruled and that cross-defendant has 30 days to answer.
