 Case Number:  21SMCV01420    Hearing Date:   November 8, 2023    Dept:  I The parties jointly request a continuance of the trial.  The genesis of the request is that the
parties thought that the case had settled, but the carrier ultimately refused
to fund part of the settlement.  The
error was, so far as the court can tell, an honest one.  And the court cannot fault the parties for
putting their collective “pencils down” when they thought they had a deal so as
not to incur unnecessary expenses.
The court will inquire whether there might still be a
settlement.  As the court understands it,
defendant was going to fund the settlement by increasing the loan on the
property, which would be paid off as the units now under construction were
sold.  The lender, however, will not
increase the loan as it relates to at least one plaintiff, meaning that the
funds are not there to settle with that plaintiff.  The court will inquire whether, as to that
plaintiff, there is still a settlement on the theory that plaintiff will get
first dollar in (exclusive of money needed to repay the loan) from any sale of
any unit, perhaps plus interest? 
But whether or not there is a sale, the case needs to be
continued.  The court will discuss timing
with the parties.  The application is
GRANTED.
