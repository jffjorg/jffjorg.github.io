 Case Number:  20SMCV01915    Hearing Date:   November 8, 2023    Dept:  I The ex parte application is DENIED.
Defendants seek to continue the trial to allow the court to
hear their discovery motions and obtain further discovery.  Presently, the trial is set for December 11,
2023.  The motions have been reserved for
hearing on December 8, 2023 and December 11, 2023, but no motion has actually
been filed.
Although the case was filed almost three years ago,
defendants elected to serve the discovery at issue on September 28, 2023, by
electronic mail.  They claim responses
were due on October 31, 2023 (although it might really be November 1,
2023).  Plaintiff did not respond to the
discovery.  Defendants then insisted on
responses the next day (November 1, 2023). 
Plaintiff asserted that it did not get the discovery, which turns out
(according to defendants) to be untrue. 
Plaintiff eventually said it would provide responses.  Plaintiff allegedly “dumped” 700 pages of
documents over the next 2 or 3 days.  It
also seems to have responded to the discovery requests.  Defendants claim that the discovery is not
sufficient and would like to bring a motion to compel.
The problem here is, simply, a lack of diligence.  Defendants served discovery right under the
wire.  With the discovery cutoff on
November 9, 2023, defendants served the discovery with about a week to
spare.  That left no room for error.  Worse, even had defendants brought a motion
to compel (which requires no meet and confer) the day after the responses were
due, it could not have been heard until November 28, 2023—16 court days
assuming personal service.  But that
motion would be untimely, as it would be less than 15 days before trial.
In other words, while one would have hoped plaintiff would
have responded fully and completely by October 31, 2023 (or maybe November 1,
2023), defendants took the risk of dispute upon themselves by waiting until the
last minute.  And they are simply too
late.  The declaration in support of the
application is also insufficient.  It
attaches the responses to certain interrogatories, but not of the plaintiff who
answered substantively and whose answers the other plaintiffs adopted.  And the court has been around too long to
view 700 documents as a “dump.”  Litigators
eat 700 documents for breakfast.
The court will not hear argument on this matter.
