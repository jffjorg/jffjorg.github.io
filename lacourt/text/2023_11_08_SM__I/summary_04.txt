And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants a continuance of the trial, as the parties jointly request. The case had appeared to be settled, but the carrier refused to fund part of the settlement, which was an honest mistake. The Judge cannot fault the parties for pausing their efforts to settle when they thought they had a deal, to avoid unnecessary expenses. The Judge will inquire whether there is still a possibility of settlement, as the Defendant was planning to fund the settlement by increasing the loan on the property, which would be repaid as units under construction were sold. However, the lender will not increase the loan for one plaintiff, meaning that funds are not available for that plaintiff. The Judge will discuss timing with the parties and will consider alternative settlement options, such as the plaintiff receiving the first dollar from any unit sale, plus interest.
