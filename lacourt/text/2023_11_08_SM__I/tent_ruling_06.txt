 Case Number:  22SMCV02734    Hearing Date:   November 8, 2023    Dept:  I The court’s view is unchanged from yesterday.  The same order issued then is the court’s
order today.  However, defendant did not
appear at yesterday’s hearing.  If
defendant appears today, the court will hear argument.  It could well be that defendant was confused
as to the actual hearing date due to the unexplained decision to file multiple
motions.
