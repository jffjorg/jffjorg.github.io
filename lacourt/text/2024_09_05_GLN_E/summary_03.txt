Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion to quash a subpoena issued by the plaintiff, Hejia Zhu, to Bank of America. The motion is made by Bad Rabbit Investment, LLC, a non-party that was not named as a defendant in the original complaint but was later added as a defendant in a First Amended Complaint. The judge finds that the deposition hold in CCP § 2025.210(b) applies to a deposition subpoena seeking business records and that no defendant has been served with the summons and complaint. Therefore, the judge grants the motion to quash the subpoena. Additionally, the judge will hear argument on the request for sanctions in the amount of $2,910.00.
