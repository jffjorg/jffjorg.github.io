And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to a request for production of documents. The plaintiffs, Edward Cida and Erika Yvette Vazquez, filed a complaint against Ford Motor Company and DOES 1-10 alleging three causes of action related to a 2020 Ford Escape that they purchased on May 21, 2020. The plaintiffs are seeking to compel further responses to the defendant's objections and are requesting production of documents relevant to the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (SBA) causes of action.

The court has granted the motion to compel further responses as to certain requests for production of documents, but has denied the motion as to other requests. The court found that the plaintiffs did not demonstrate good cause or relevance for the denied requests.

The court also noted that the plaintiffs' counsel did not request sanctions, but under the Discovery Act, the court may award sanctions to a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even if no opposition was filed.
