  Case Number:  23VECV02068    Hearing Date:   February 13, 2024    Dept:  T 23VECV02068 MARIA LOBO vs
CITY OF LOS ANGELES 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER:  Defendant City of Los Angeles’ Motion for
Judgment on the Pleadings is GRANTED WITH 20 DAYS LEAVE TO AMEND.  
Introduction 
Defendants City of Los Angeles
(City) and Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) (Defendant) moved for judgment
on the pleadings against Plaintiff Maria Lobo’s (Plaintiff) First Amended
Complaint (FAC).  The motion moved
against both the first cause of action (COA) for negligence and the second COA
for intentional tort.
Discussion  
Plaintiff submitted to some of
the arguments in the motion and requested leave to amend the defects in the
pleading.  (See Notice to Opposition, pg.
1:22-23.)  Plaintiff submitted to City’s
argument regarding the FAC’s failure to identify the statutory grounds for
liability; the City’s argument as to direct liability; and the non-existence of
a statute for a claim of negligent hiring, training and supervision.  (Munoz v. City of Union City (2004) 120
Cal.App.4th 1077, 1111-1115; de Villers v. County of San Diego (2007) 156
Cal.App.4th 238, 252-56.)  However, as
argued by Plaintiff, there are facts alleged to present a claim for vicarious
liability through City’s employee – an LAPD officer.  (Gov. Code, secs. 815.2 and 820.)  Based upon these facts and argument,
Plaintiff sufficiently showed an ability to cure the defects in failing to
expressly identify the statutory grounds for liability and in failing to
expressly plead vicarious liability against City.  Because the pleading defects can be cured,
there is grounds to grant Plaintiff leave to amend.
City also argued that government
entities have immunity for Discretionary Acts. 
(Gov. Code, sec. 820.2.)  City
argued that methods to effectuate a detention/arrest are discretionary choices
and subject to the Discretionary Acts Immunity. 
(Conway v. City of Tuolumne (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 1005 (Conway) – where
the Court applied the immunity in a case involving the police’s decision to use
tear gas.) The Discretionary Acts Immunity distinguishes between “planning” and
“operational” functions of government.  (Conway, supra, 231 Cal.App.4th at p.
1014.)  Planning involves basic policy
decisions and operation involves lower-level or ministerial decisions that
merely implement a basic policy already formulated.  (Conway, supra, 231 Cal.App.4th at p.
1014-1015.)  Discretionary Acts Immunity
applies to planning functions and does not apply to operational functions.  Although the Discretionary Acts Immunity has
been found to apply to many areas of police work, the immunity does not apply
to a police officer’s decision “to arrest an individual when there was no
probable cause to do so.  (Conway, supra,
231 Cal.App.4th at p. 1015; citing to Gillan v. City of San Marino (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 1033, 1047.)  Plaintiff
expressly alleged the arrest/imprisonment was without a warrant and without
legal justification – inferring lack of probable cause.  Because City’s citation to case law authority
directly contradicts City’s argument, Defendant’s argument as to immunity, at
least at this pleading stage, is unpersuasive. 

The motion for judgment on the
pleadings is GRANTED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND. 

IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE
NOTICE.
