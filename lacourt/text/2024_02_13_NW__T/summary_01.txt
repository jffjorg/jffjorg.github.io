And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Maria Lobo vs City of Los Angeles. The City has moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint (FAC) fails to identify the statutory grounds for liability and that the City has immunity for its discretionary acts. The Judge has granted the City's motion with leave to amend, finding that the Plaintiff has shown an ability to cure the defects in the pleadings. The Judge also rejected the City's argument that its discretionary acts are immune from liability, citing case law that suggests that immunity does not apply to operational functions of government, such as the decision to arrest someone without probable cause. The Judge has given the Plaintiff 20 days to amend the defects in the pleadings.
