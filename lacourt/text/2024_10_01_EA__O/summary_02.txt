```

And here is a text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a court hearing where the plaintiff's attorney fees will be determined. The plaintiff has cited certain cases, but the judge finds that one of the cases cited, a declaration from Richard Pearl, is irrelevant because it is from a different case and based on fees in San Francisco and San Diego, not Los Angeles. The judge notes that attorney fees are based on those in the same community. As a result, the judge concludes that the plaintiff's counsel has not met its burden to show that the hourly fees charged by Counsel Nourmand ($750) and Counsel De Sario ($500) are reasonable.
