[3] Notwithstanding,
Plaintiff cites to the declaration of a Richard Pearl to show the
reasonableness of their fees should the Lodestar have been used. (See Exhibit C
of Motion.) Pearl’s opinion, however, is irrelevant as it is from 2011, from a
different case, and, most importantly, based on attorney fees in San
Francisco and San Diego, not Los Angeles. It is well established that
attorney fees are based upon those in the same community. (See Ketchum
v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.) Thus, should the court have used the Lodestar method,
Plaintiff’s Counsel has not met its burden to show how Counsel
Nourmand’s hourly fee of $750 and Counsel De Sario’s hourly fee $500 are
reasonable.
