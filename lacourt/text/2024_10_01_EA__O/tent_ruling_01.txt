  Case Number:  23STCV00906    Hearing Date:   October 1, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
MOTION FOR
APPROVAL OF PAGA ACTION SETTLEMENT is GRANTED. 
 
Background
 
This is a
wage and hour action. 
 
On January
13, 2023, Plaintiff GEORGINA ARCEO, on behalf of herself and all others
similarly situated, filed suit against Ozzo, Inc. for (1) FAILURE TO PAY
OVERTIME WAGES; (2) FAILURE TO PAY MINIMUM WAGE; (3) FAILURE TO PAY ALL WAGES
UPON TERMINATION; (4) FAILURE TO PROVIDE ACCURATE WAGE STATEMENTS and (5)
Unfair Competition. 
 
On April 13,
2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Class Action Complaint for Damages and
Restitution adding a sixth COA for CIVIL PENALTIES LABOR CODE §2699. 
 
On May 25,
2023, Plaintiff dismissed only the class claims in her complaint, without
prejudice, and proceeded against Defendant for her individual Labor Code
violations in arbitration and concurrently pursued her representative claim
under the Private Attorneys General Act (“PAGA”) in state court. 
 
On July 1,
2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion. 
 
Legal
Standard
 
Labor Code section 2699, subdivision (l)(2) states:¿“The superior court
shall review and approve any settlement of any civil action filed pursuant to
this part. The proposed settlement shall be submitted to the agency at the same
time that it is submitted to the court.”  “A copy of the superior court’s
judgment in any civil action filed pursuant to this part and any other order in
that action that either provides for or denies an award of civil penalties
under this code shall be submitted to the agency within 10 days after entry of
the judgment or order.”  (Lab. Code, §2699, subd. (l)(3).) 
 
While PAGA requires court review and approval of settlements, it does not
specify the standard or criteria for such review. (Moniz v. Adecco USA, Inc.
(2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 56, 75 (Moniz).) Thus, courts have generally
applied the same review standards used for class actions, which inquire
“independently whether a PAGA settlement is fair and reasonable.” (Id.,
at p. 77.) To determine if a PAGA settlement is fair and reasonable, courts
consider factors “including the strength of the plaintiff's case, the risk, the
stage of the proceeding, the complexity and likely duration of further
litigation, and the settlement amount.” (Ibid.) Lastly, courts will also
consider if the settlement is “adequate in view of PAGA's purposes to remediate
present labor law violations, deter future ones, and to maximize enforcement of
state labor laws.” (Ibid.)
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff moves for court approval of PAGA settlement pursuant to Labor
Code section 2699, subdivision (l)(2). 
 
Defendants have agreed to settle the matter for the gross amount of
$125,000. From this, the following would be deducted: attorney fees ($43,750, or 35% of
gross settlement amount), litigation costs (up to $1,885.12), general release
fee payment to Plaintiff ($10,000.00); settlement administration costs
($2,950.00). This will yield a net settlement amount of about $66,414.88. From
the net settlement amount, further reductions in the following amounts will be
made: $49,811.16 (paid to the LWDA (75%)) and $16,603.72 (25%) which will be
distributed to the 54 aggrieved employees. 
 
Here, the court finds that the civil penalties agreed upon are fair and
reasonable. 
 
While the total award results in only about $86 in
penalties per pay period ($125,000 award divided by 1,448 pay periods in the
PAGA period), the court finds this appropriate as it takes into account the
legal issues in this case and the risk to parties in proceeding. The court also
finds this settlement is adequate under the PAGA, as other courts have imposed
even smaller penalties. (See Carrington v. Starbucks Corp. (2018) 30
Cal.App.5th 504, 517 [where violations were minimal and compliance was
attempted, court imposed a penalty of $5 per violation].) 
 
As for the
requested general release fee of $10,000 for Plaintiff, a plaintiff may receive
reasonable enhancement payments as a class representative. Courts must balance
such an award between the interests of compensating the plaintiff for the
expense or risk they incurred in bringing the suit while avoiding creating a
perverse incentive for the plaintiff to accept suboptimal settlements in
exchange for a higher enhancement payment. (See Munoz v. BCI Coca-Cola
Bottling Co. of Los Angeles (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 399, 412.) Courts
routinely grant approval of class action settlement agreements containing
service awards for the class representatives, which are "intended to
compensate class representatives for work performed on behalf of the class to
make up for financial or reputational risk undertaken in bringing the action,
and to recognize their willingness to act as a private attorney general.”
(Motion p. 14, quoting Cellphone Fee Termination Cases (2010) 186
Cal.App.4th 1380, 1393-94.) In support of this request, Plaintiff submitted a
declaration, stating Plaintiff spent approximately 40 hours meeting with
attorneys over the case and remaining actively involved in the litigation and
settlement process. Thus, the court approves the requested general release fee.

 
As for
attorney fees, pursuant to Labor Code section 2699, subdivision (g), an
employee who prevails in a PAGA action is entitled to an award of attorney fees
and costs. Though in some cases it may be appropriate
to cross-check the percentage of recovery against Counsel’s lodestar, it is not required. (Consumer Privacy Cases (2009)
175 Cal.App.4th 545, 557.) Though the lodestar method provides for “better
accountability,” a percentage method also has its advantages as it “establishes
reasonable expectations on the part of plaintiffs' attorneys as to their
expected recovery; and it encourages early settlement, which avoids protracted
litigation.” (Lafitte v. Robert Half Internat. Inc. (2016) 1 Cal.5th
480, 490.)[1]  Here, the court
elects to use a percentage method for its primary calculation of the fee award,
which is a matter of discretion. (Id. at pp. 503-504.) And empirical studies show that fee awards in class
actions average around one-third of the recovery. (Ibid, fn. 13.)[2] Therefore, Plaintiff’s
claimed fee of 35% is reasonable.[3]
 
 
Overall,
there are no defects or concerns with the motion. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, the motion is granted. (A proposed order has been filed.)
