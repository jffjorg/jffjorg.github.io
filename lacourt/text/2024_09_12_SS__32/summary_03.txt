And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Citiguard, Inc., has moved to deem matters admitted and compel responses from the plaintiff, Kenneth Moore, regarding requests for admission, interrogatories, and a request for production. The defendant served these requests on April 22, 2024, and the responses were due on May 24, 2024. Although the plaintiff's counsel requested an extension, no responses were served. The court has granted the motion to deem the matters admitted and compel the responses.

The court finds that monetary sanctions are warranted, but the amount requested is excessive given the lack of opposition and the fact that counsel may appear remotely at the hearing. The court awards monetary sanctions in the amount of $300 per motion (1.5 hour of attorney time), for a total of $1200.

The plaintiff is ordered to provide responses within 30 days and is required to pay the monetary sanctions within 30 days. The defendant is ordered to provide notice of the court's order and file a proof of service of such.
