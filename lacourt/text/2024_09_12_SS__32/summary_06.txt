And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to compel the County of Los Angeles to provide further responses to special interrogatories, set one. The plaintiff, Kelajae Kareem McClain, served the interrogatories on December 21, 2023, and the defendant responded on February 12, 2024. However, the plaintiff claims the responses were deficient and attempted to meet and confer with the defendant, but the issues were not resolved.

The judge notes that the parties participated in an informal discovery conference on June 7, 2024, but did not resolve the issues. The judge also notes that the plaintiff did not file an IDC statement with the court or schedule an IDC for this particular motion, as required by the court's June 7, 2024 order.

Based on this, the judge is ordering the plaintiff to schedule IDCs and reschedule the hearing dates on the motion. The judge is also ordering the plaintiff to provide notice of the court's orders and file a proof of service of such.
