Significant Statements:

  - "Conduct falling below the professional standard of care, such as failure to timely object or to properly advance an argument, is not therefore excusable."
  - "The mandatory relief provision does not apply to dismissals for 'failure to prosecute, dismissals for failure to serve a complaint within three years, dismissals based on running of the statute of limitations, and voluntary dismissals entered pursuant to settlement.'"

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to reconsider an order imposing monetary sanctions against Plaintiff's counsel. The sanctions were imposed on July 10, 2024, due to counsel's failure to file a request for service by publication and a motion for relief in the bankruptcy court. The motion is timely, but the mandatory provision of Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b) does not apply since the order imposing sanctions was not equivalent to a dismissal motion.

The Court finds that the mistake or neglect at the July 10 Order to Show Cause was not excusable. Counsel's failure to file the necessary documents was not due to a clerical mistake or a reasonable excuse. Therefore, the Court denies the motion to reconsider the order imposing monetary sanctions.

The Court notes that the plaintiff's memorandum only argues that because the counsel responsible for the imposition of sanctions have left the firm, that sanctions should not be imposed. However, this fails to show that the underlying mistake or neglect was excusable.
