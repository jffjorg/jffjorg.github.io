And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the motion for order compelling non-party Alex Marroquin to comply with a deposition subpoena for production of business records. The motion was filed by plaintiffs Jill Reichman and Howard Reichman, who are seeking monetary sanctions. The subpoena was served by substitute service on Marroquin's wife, but the proof of service does not show that Marroquin was mailed notice. The court finds that the motion is procedurally defective and denies it.
