And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to consolidate two cases, State Farm v. Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Case No. 23STLC07359) and Torkian v. Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, et al. (Case No. 22STCV32014). The defendant, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, moved to consolidate the cases for all purposes, citing California Code of Civil Procedure section 1048 and California Rules of Court, rule 3.350, subdivision (a)(1). The court found that the two cases are deemed related and are pending in Department 32, but there has been no reclassification of the limited case to an unlimited case. The court denied the motion to consolidate, citing the potential for delay and complexity in the trial of the cases.
