[1] Since
the Notice of Motion and memorandum seek relief solely under Code of Civil
Procedure section 473(b), the Court will rule according to that statute. (See
Code Civ. Proc. § 1010; Luri v. Greenwald¿(2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 1119, 1125
[“As a general rule, the trial court may consider only the grounds stated in
the notice of motion.”].)
