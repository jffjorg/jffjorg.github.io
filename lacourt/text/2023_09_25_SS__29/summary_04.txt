## English Summary

This tentative ruling concerns a motion to compel further discovery responses filed by Defendant Mildred Johanna Fuentes against Plaintiff Emmanuel Anyaogu. The case stems from a vehicle accident in 2019. Defendant contends that Plaintiff's responses to Form Interrogatories were incomplete and evasive, specifically regarding details about medical treatment received and income calculations.

The Judge partially grants the motion to compel, requiring Plaintiff to provide complete and specific answers to Interrogatories 6.4 and 8.4. However, the motion to compel a response to Interrogatory 17.1 is denied due to a lack of evidence that requests for admissions were served concurrently. 

The Judge also grants Defendant's request for sanctions against Plaintiff and his attorney, Chijioke O. Ikonte, for the inadequate discovery responses. The sanctions amount to $561.65, covering attorney fees and filing fees.
