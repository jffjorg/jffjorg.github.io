Here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants in part the motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories Nos. 6.4 and 8.4, as Plaintiff's responses were incomplete and evasive. The motion to compel a response to Form Interrogatory No. 17.1 is denied, as there is no evidence that requests for admission were served concurrently with the form interrogatories. The judge also grants in part the request for sanctions, ordering Plaintiff and his counsel to pay $561.65 in monetary sanctions to Defendant. The judge orders Plaintiff to provide further verified, code-compliant responses to Form Interrogatories Nos. 6.4 and 8.4 within 30 days of notice of this order.
