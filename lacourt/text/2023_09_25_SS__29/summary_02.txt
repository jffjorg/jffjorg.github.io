And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a petition to approve a minor's compromise. The only issue with the petition is that no guardian ad litem has been appointed for the minor claimant. Although the court rejected the initial application for appointment of a guardian ad litem in December 2020, no subsequent application has been filed. Since an action has been initiated by the claimant, the guardian ad litem must file the petition, not the parent. Therefore, the petition to approve the minor's compromise is continued for approximately 30 days to allow for the filing of a petition for a guardian ad litem. The moving party is required to give notice of the continuation.

## English Summary

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case 20STCV45648, scheduled for hearing on September 25, 2023. The main reason for the ruling is that a guardian ad litem has not been appointed for the minor involved in the case.

Previously, an application for appointment of a guardian ad litem was rejected on December 1, 2020, and no new application has been filed. The Judge emphasizes that, due to the ongoing lawsuit, the petition for approving the minor's compromise can only be filed by the guardian ad litem. 

Therefore, the hearing is continued for approximately 30 days to allow for a petition for a guardian ad litem to be submitted. The party who filed the petition is responsible for providing notice of this continuance.

## English Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a petition to approve a compromise settlement for a minor (Claimant) in a lawsuit.

The key issue is that no guardian ad litem has been appointed to represent the minor's best interests in this case. While a parent could potentially file the petition in a situation without an ongoing lawsuit, since a lawsuit has already been initiated, the guardian ad litem must be the one to file the petition.  

Because no guardian ad litem has been appointed, and a previous application for one was rejected, the Judge is continuing the hearing for approximately 30 days to allow for a new petition for a guardian ad litem to be submitted.

### English Text Summary
The judge's tentative ruling states that the only issue with the petition to approve the minor's compromise is the lack of a guardian ad litem. The application and order for appointment of the guardian ad litem were rejected on December 1, 2020, and no subsequent application has been filed. According to Code of Civil Procedure, § 372, a minor must appear by a guardian ad litem, or guardian or conservator of the estate. Since an action has been initiated, the guardian ad litem must file the petition. The court cannot approve the compromise without a guardian ad litem. Therefore, the petition is continued for approximately 30 days to allow for the submission of a petition for a guardian ad litem, and the moving party is required to give notice.
