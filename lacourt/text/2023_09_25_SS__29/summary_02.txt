  - However, where an action has been initiated, the guardian ad litem must file the petition.
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a petition to approve a minor's compromise. The only issue with the petition is that no guardian ad litem has been appointed for the minor claimant. Although the court rejected the initial application for appointment of a guardian ad litem in December 2020, no subsequent application has been filed. Since an action has been initiated by the claimant, the guardian ad litem must file the petition, not the parent. Therefore, the petition to approve the minor's compromise is continued for approximately 30 days to allow for the filing of a petition for a guardian ad litem. The moving party is required to give notice of the continuation.
