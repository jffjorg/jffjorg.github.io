 Case Number:  20STCV45648    Hearing Date:   September 25, 2023    Dept:  29 TENTATIVE   The only issue with this petition is the fact that no  guardian ad litem has been appointed. The Court notes that the application and  order for appointment of the guardian ad litem for Claimant was rejected on  December 1, 2020. No subsequent application to appoint guardian ad litem has  been filed. The court cannot approve the compromise of a minor who has no  guardian ad litem. A parent may file a petition for a minor’s disputed claim if  no lawsuit has been filed. However, here, where an action has been initiated,  the guardian ad litem must file the petition. (See Code Civ. Proc., §  372 [minor as party must appear by guardian ad litem, or guardian or  conservator of the estate].)   Therefore, the Petition to approve minor’s compromise is CONTINUED for approximately 30 days so that a petition for a guardian ad  litem may be submittedMoving party to give notice.
