And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants the Defendant's motion for leave to take a subsequent deposition of the Plaintiff. The Defendant had initially taken the Plaintiff's deposition on April 7, 2022, but the Plaintiff underwent surgery after the deposition, which included an invasive treatment. The Defendant did not learn about the surgery until recently and has issued written discovery to evaluate the Plaintiff's claimed damages. The Plaintiff's discovery responses were vague, evasive, and not helpful, and the Defendant believes that a second deposition will speed up the process and minimize inconvenience to all parties. The Judge finds that the Defendant has made a showing of good cause justifying a subsequent deposition of the Plaintiff, and the deposition will be limited to treatment occurring after the initial deposition and any other facts occurring after April 7, 2022 that relate to the Plaintiff's claims for damages. The deposition will be limited to 2.5 hours (excluding breaks) and will be scheduled within 30 days of notice of this order.
