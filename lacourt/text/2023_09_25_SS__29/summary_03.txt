And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants the Defendant's motion for leave to take a subsequent deposition of the Plaintiff. The Defendant had initially taken the Plaintiff's deposition on April 7, 2022, but the Plaintiff underwent surgery after the deposition, which included an invasive treatment. The Defendant did not learn about the surgery until recently and has issued written discovery to evaluate the Plaintiff's claimed damages. The Plaintiff's discovery responses were vague, evasive, and not helpful, and the Defendant believes that a second deposition will speed up the process and minimize inconvenience to all parties. The Judge finds that the Defendant has made a showing of good cause justifying a subsequent deposition of the Plaintiff, and the deposition will be limited to treatment occurring after the initial deposition and any other facts occurring after April 7, 2022 that relate to the Plaintiff's claims for damages. The deposition will be limited to 2.5 hours (excluding breaks) and will be scheduled within 30 days of notice of this order.

```

**English Summary:**

The judge has tentatively ruled to grant the defendant's motion for leave to take a subsequent deposition of the plaintiff. This is because the defendant has shown good cause, particularly since the plaintiff underwent two surgeries after her initial deposition in 2022, and her discovery responses regarding these surgeries and resulting damages have been deemed inadequate. 

The subsequent deposition will be limited to:

1. **Treatment after April 7, 2022**: This includes information about the two surgeries the plaintiff underwent.
2. **Any other facts after April 7, 2022, related to damages**: This allows the defendant to explore any new information relevant to the plaintiff's claims for compensation.

The deposition will last a maximum of 2.5 hours, excluding breaks.

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to take a subsequent deposition of the plaintiff. The plaintiff had previously been deposed in April 2022, and since then, she underwent surgery and incurred significant medical expenses. The defendant did not learn about the plaintiff's surgeries until recently and has issued written discovery requests to the plaintiff to evaluate her claimed damages. The plaintiff's discovery responses were vague, evasive, and not helpful, and the defendant believes that a second deposition will speed up the discovery process and minimize inconvenience to all parties. The judge has limited the subsequent deposition to 2.5 hours and has restricted the questioning to topics related to the plaintiff's treatment and claims for damages after the initial deposition.

Summary:
This tentative ruling grants Defendant's motion for leave to take a second deposition of Plaintiff in a personal injury case arising from a fall while trying to board a bus. Plaintiff underwent surgery after the first deposition, and Defendant discovered Plaintiff's surgeries only recently. Defendant argues that Plaintiff's discovery responses were vague and not helpful, and that a second deposition will speed up the process and minimize inconvenience to all parties. Plaintiff has not filed any opposition to the motion. The second deposition will be limited to 2.5 hours and will cover treatment occurring after the first deposition and any other facts occurring after that date that relate to Plaintiff's claims for damages. Plaintiff is ordered to appear for further deposition and answer questions on a date to be arranged by counsel within 30 days of notice of this order.
