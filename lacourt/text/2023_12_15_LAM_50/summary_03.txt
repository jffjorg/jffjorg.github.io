And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling notes that the Estate of Mr. Ridinger, who passed away on August 30, 2022, prior to the commencement of the action on October 11, 2022, was served with the Summons and Complaint via email to one of the Estate's attorneys in Florida. The Executor of the Estate, Loren Ridinger, has submitted a declaration stating that the Estate accepted service by executing a Notice and Acknowledgment of Service form. The Judge appears to be accepting these facts as true and will likely grant the Estate's motion to be added to the case at the upcoming hearing.
