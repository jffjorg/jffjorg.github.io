And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint. The proposed amendment adds a cause of action for fraudulent concealment and a prayer for punitive damages. The judge finds that the plaintiffs complied with the relevant rules and that there is no prejudice to the defendant. The judge notes that the statute of limitations and the economic loss rule are not being decided in this motion. The judge orders the plaintiffs to file the First Amended Complaint within 10 days and for their counsel to keep time records to identify the time devoted to the new claim.
