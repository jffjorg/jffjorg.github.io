And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by the Judge regarding Defendant Second Home US, Inc.'s motion to consolidate two actions: the present case (St. Andrews Second Home LLC v. Second Home US, Inc.) and St. Andrews Second Home LLC v. Second Home US Inc., et al., case No. 23STCV21223. The Judge has denied the motion. The two actions involve the same property, with one being a breach of lease and the other an unlawful detainer proceeding. Although they have overlapping issues, the primary issue in the unlawful detainer action is possession of the premises. The Judge has concluded that consolidating the cases would frustrate the summary proceeding under which the plaintiff seeks to regain possession of the property. The Judge has also noted that the cases are not in the same department and therefore cannot be consolidated under Local Rule 3.3(g)(1).
