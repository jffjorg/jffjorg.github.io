Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Armando J. Berriz, moved to compel the production of documents requested during the deposition of Jacob Emrani. The plaintiff, The Law Offices of Jacob Emrani, produced the requested documents after the motion was filed. The defendant is seeking $3,085 in monetary sanctions against the plaintiff for failing to produce the documents earlier.

The court found that the defendant made a sufficient effort to informally resolve the dispute before filing the motion. The plaintiff argued that the documents did not respond to the categories of documents requested in the notice of deposition, but the court found that the claim management system notes about the plaintiff's representation of Karen Edmonson fell within the requested categories.

The court granted the defendant's motion as to the imposition of monetary sanctions, ordering the plaintiff to pay $3,085 in sanctions within 20 days. The court also found that the plaintiff and its counsel did not act with substantial justification and that sanctions were just under the circumstances.
