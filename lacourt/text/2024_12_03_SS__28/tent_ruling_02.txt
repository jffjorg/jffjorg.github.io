On January 25, 2024, Cross-Defendant  Jasmine Novoa Torres filed an answer to Windom’s cross-complaint.  On  July 9, 2024, Plaintiffs amended the complaint to include Defendant D&W  Trucking, Inc. as Doe 3.  B.   Case number 22STCV22649  On  July 13, 2022, Plaintiff Delila Rangel, by and through her guardian ad litem  George Rangel (“Rangel”), filed an action against Defendants Windom, D & W  Trucking, Inc.

On August 5, 2024, the Court dismissed Windom’s  cross-complaint without prejudice.  On  February 5, 2024, Windom filed an answer to Rangel’s complaint.  C.   The Court relates and consolidates the cases  On  May 30, 2023, the Court found that case numbers 20STCV46032 and 22STCV22649 are  related within the meaning of California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a).  Case number 20STCV46032 became the lead case.  The cases were assigned to Department 28 of the Spring Street Courthouse for  all purposes.  On  October 10, 2023, the Court consolidated the cases for all purposes based on  the parties’ stipulation. Case number 20STCV46032 remained the lead case.  Trial  is currently scheduled for April 23, 2025.  D.   These motions            On September 30, 2024, Windom filed (1) a motion to compel  Gregorio’s responses to special interrogatories, set one, and form  interrogatories, set two (Windom should have filed separate motions to compel,  one for each type of interrogatory), (2) a motion to deem admitted matters  specified in requests for admission served on Jazmine Torres Novoa (“Novoa”),  and (3) a motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission served on Gregorio.  The  motions were set for hearing on December 3, 2024.  On September 30 and November 12, 2024, Novoa  and Gregorio (“Plaintiffs”) filed oppositions.  On November 25 and November 26, 2024, Windom  filed replies.  PARTIES’ REQUESTS  Windom  asks the Court (1) to compel Gregorio’s responses to special interrogatories,  set one, and form interrogatories, set two, (2) to deem admitted matters  specified in requests for admission served on Novoa, and (3) to deem admitted  matters specified in requests for admission served on served on Gregorio. Windom  also asks the Court to impose sanctions on Plaintiffs and their counsel.  Plaintiffs  ask the Court to deny the motions and impose sanctions on Windom and his  counsel.  LEGAL STANDARD  A.   Interrogatories  Code  of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides:  “If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails  to serve a timely response, the following rules apply:  “(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are  directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under  Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including  one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4  (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that  party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following  conditions are satisfied:  “(1) The party has subsequently served a response that  is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and  2030.240.  “(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response  was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  “(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may  move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories.  “(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under  Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or  attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to  interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted  with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition  of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling  answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition  of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under  Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that  sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing  with Section 2023.010).”  (Code Civ. Proc., §  2030.290.)            B.       Requests  for admission            Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280 provides:            “If a party to whom requests for admission are  directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply:  “(a) The party to whom the requests for admission are  directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege  or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section  2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its  determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied:  “(1) The party has subsequently served a response that  is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230.  “(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response  was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  “(b) The requesting party may move for an order that  the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the  requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7  (commencing with Section 2023.010).  “(c) The court shall make this order, unless it finds  that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has  served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests  for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. It is  mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing  with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to  serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.)   DISCUSSION  A.   Windom’s motion to compel interrogatory responses  On August  12, 2024, Windom served form interrogatories, set two, and special interrogatories,  set one, on Gregorio.  Windom argues that Gregorio did not serve timely responses  and had not served responses by the time Defendant filed these motions.  However, on September 10, 2024, Plaintiffs’ counsel  sent Windom’s counsel an email which listed Plaintiffs’ objections to the interrogatories.  (Exh. I.)   No verification is required for objection-only interrogatory responses.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.250, subd. (a).)  If Windom believed Plaintiffs’ objections were without  merit or too general, Windom could have filed a motion to compel further  responses to the interrogatories.  (See  Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a)(3).)   Windom, however, filed a motion to compel responses, which is not  authorized when the party to whom the interrogatories are directed has served a  timely response.  (See Code Civ. Proc., §  2030.290.)  The  Court denies Windom’s motion.  Plaintiffs  request $1,100.00 in monetary sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section  2030.290, subdivision (c), based on four hours of attorney time at a rate of  $275.00 per hour “to prepare opposition, reply and attend the hearings in these  matters . . . .”  The Court awards  Plaintiffs $500.00 in sanctions based on two hours of attorney time at a reasonable  rate of $250.00 per hour.  B.   Windom’s motions to deem admitted matters specified in  requests for admission  On  August 12, 2024, Windom served requests for admission, set one, on Gregorio and  Novoa.  Windom argues that Gregorio and Novoa did not serve timely responses  and had not served responses by the time Defendant filed these motions.  However,  on September 10, 2024, Plaintiffs’ counsel sent Windom’s counsel an email which  listed Plaintiffs’ objections to the requests for admission.  (Exh. I.)   No verification is required for objection-only responses to requests for  admission.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.240,  subd. (a).)  Nonetheless, Plaintiffs do not rely on their objections served on September 10, 2024.  Instead, Plaintiffs assert that they served verified responses to the requests for admission on November 4, 2024, preventing the Court from deeming admitted the matters specified in the requests for admission.  Plaintiffs also ask the Court to refrain from imposing sanctions because, they assert, the requests for admission were not propounded in separate documents.  In his replies, however, Windom has submitted an email which shows that his counsel separately served the requests for admission electronically.  (Exh. J.)  Windom admits that Plaintiffs served verified responses to the requests for admission prior to the hearing on the motions but argues the responses are deficient.  If Windom complies with the statutory requirements and the Court's Eighth Amended Standing Order, Windom may file a motion to compel further responses to the requests  for admission.  (See Code Civ. Proc., §  2033.290.) Sanctions are mandatory under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (c).   Windom requests monetary sanctions based on 5 hours of attorney time at a rate of $300.00 per hour and two $60.00 filing fees.  Counsel spent 1.5 hours of attorney time to prepare each motion and anticipated spending two hours to attend the hearing.  The Court awards Windom $620.00 based on two hours of attorney time at a reasonable rate of $250.00 per hour and two filing fees.   CONCLUSION  The Court DENIES Defendant Franklin  Windom’s motion to compel Plaintiffs Jazmin Torres Novoa and  Ashley Gregorio, by her guardian ad litem Jazmin Torres Novoa, to serve responses  to form interrogatories, set two, and special interrogatories, set one.  The Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ request for  sanctions and orders Defendant Franklin Windom and his counsel to pay Plaintiffs  Jazmin Torres Novoa and Ashley Gregorio, by her guardian ad litem Jazmin Torres  Novoa, $500.00 by January 2, 2025.   The  Court DENIES Defendant Franklin Windom’s motion to deem admitted matters  specified in requests for admission served on Plaintiff Jazmin Torres Novoa.The Court DENIES Defendant Franklin Windom’s motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission served on Plaintiff Ashley Gregorio, by her guardian ad litem Jazmin Torres Novoa.The Court GRANTS Defendant Franklin Windom's request for sanctions on his motions to deem matters admitted and orders Plaintiffs Jazmin Torres Novoa and Ashley Gregorio, by her guardian ad litem Jazmin Torres Novoa, and their counsel to pay Defendant Frank Windom $620.00 by January 2, 2025. The Court ORDERS Defendant Frank Windom to pay the Court an additional $60.00 filing fee by January 2, 2025 based on his failure to file separate motions to compel responses to form and special interrogatories.  Moving  party is to give notice of this ruling.  Moving  party is ordered to file proof of service of this ruling with the Court within  five days.
