And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motions filed by the parties and has reached a tentative ruling. The Defendant, City of Pomona, seeks to reopen discovery to correct errors made by its previous counsel, whose untimely death caused the Court to continue the trial. The Defendant argues that it should have the opportunity to correct these errors, including the failure to seek to amend its expert witness list to include the doctor who it now wishes to examine the Plaintiff. The Court has considered the factors listed in California Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050 and declines to exercise its discretion to reopen discovery. The Defendant has not shown sufficient diligence to warrant the Court's exercise of discretion, and the Court finds that reopening discovery would not be in the best interest of justice. Therefore, the Court DENIES the Defendant's motion to reopen discovery.
