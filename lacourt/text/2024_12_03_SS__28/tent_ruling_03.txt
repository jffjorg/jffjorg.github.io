Petitioner

compromise of Plaintiff Micaela Avilez’s claims. 
DISCUSSION 
A.   Plaintiff Ozais Banuelos Verdugo 
The petition provides the following information: 
Gross settlement amount:                              $10,000.00
Total medical expenses:                                 $3,713.00
Medical expenses paid:                                  $421.40
Reductions:                                                    $105.35
          To be
paid/reimbursed from proceeds:            $316.05
          Liens:                                                             $421.40
          Attorney’s
fees:                                             $2,500.00
          Costs:                                                             $120.90
          Net
balance:                                                   $7,063.05

 Section
12a(1) of the petition states that total medical expenses were $3,713.00.
Section 12a(3) of the petition states that this amount was reduced by $105.35.
This should mean that the remaining amount of medical expenses – $3,607.65 –
will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. However, Section
12a(4) of the petition states that only $316.05 will be paid or reimbursed from
the settlement proceeds.  As a result, $3,291.60
of the medical expenses remain unaccounted for. 
The
reduction amounts listed in Section 12b(5)(b) of the petition do not appear to
be included in Section 12a(3). 
Section
12b(5)(b)(i) states that City of Montebello charged $581.00 for medical
services and received payment of $581.00. 
Although Medi-Cal appears to have paid the other medical providers, the
petition does not state who paid $581.00 to City of Montebello or whether the person
or entity who made this payment has waived the right to be reimbursed from the
settlement proceeds for the payment. 
  The Court cannot grant a petition unless it
shows that all medical expenses that have not been waived or reduced will be
paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. 
The
Court denies the petition. 
B.   Micaela Avilez 
The
petition provides the following information: 
Gross
settlement amount:                              $75,000.00
Total
medical expenses:                                 $89,093.90
Medical
expenses paid:                                  $10,279.10
Reductions:                                                    $78,814.80
To
be paid/reimbursed from proceeds:           $11,387.15
Liens:                                                             $21,873.10
Attorney’s
fees:                                             $18,750.00
or $15,000.00
Costs:                                                             $179.13
Net
balance:                                                   $48,433.72
 Section
12a(1) of the petition states that total medical expenses were $89,093.90.
Section 12a(3) of the petition states that this amount was reduced by $78,814.80.
This should mean that the remaining amount of medical expenses – $10,279.10 –
will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. However, Section
12a(4) of the petition states that $11,387.15 will be paid or reimbursed from
the settlement proceeds.  This is $1,108.05 more than the difference between
the total medical expenses and the reduction amount.  The petition does not explain why the
settlement proceeds will be used to pay or reimburse an amount in excess of the
non-reduced medical expenses. 
Section
13a of the petition states that attorney’s fees are $18,750.00.  However, section 16c states that attorney’s
fees are $15,000.00.  The figures should
be the same. 
The
Court denies the petition.
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES without prejudice the petition to
approve the compromise of Plaintiff Ozais Banuelos Verdugo’s claims filed by
Petitioner Alfredo Verdugo on October 14, 2024. 
 The
Court DENIES without prejudice the petition to approve the compromise of
Plaintiff Micaela Avilez’s claims filed by Petitioner Veronica Banuelos on
October 14, 2024.

are ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Petitioners
