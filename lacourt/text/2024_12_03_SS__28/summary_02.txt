And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers and has made the following ruling. The plaintiff, Jazmin Torres Novoa, and her guardian ad litem, Ashley Gregorio, filed a complaint against the defendant, Franklin Winbom, and others. The case was related to another case filed by a different plaintiff, Delila Rangel, and was consolidated with that case.

The defendant, Franklin Winbom, filed a motion to compel the plaintiffs to respond to certain interrogatories and requests for admission. The Court denied the motion, finding that the plaintiffs had served timely responses to the interrogatories and requests for admission. The Court also awarded the plaintiffs $500.00 in sanctions for the defendant's failure to comply with the Court's rules.

The defendant also filed a motion to deem admitted certain matters specified in the requests for admission. The Court denied this motion, finding that the plaintiffs had served verified responses to the requests for admission prior to the hearing on the motion. The Court also awarded the defendant $620.00 in sanctions for his failure to comply with the Court's rules.

The Court ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiffs $500.00 and the Court an additional $60.00 filing fee by January 2, 2025. The Court also ordered the plaintiffs and their counsel to pay the defendant $620.00 by the same date.
