And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on two petitions to approve the compromise of claims for two plaintiffs, Ozais Banuelos Verdugo and Micaela Avilez. The petitions were filed by their guardians ad litem, Alfredo Verdugo and Veronica Banuelos. The petitions seek approval of the compromise of the claims based on the gross settlement amounts and medical expenses. However, the judge has denied both petitions due to inconsistencies in the medical expense reductions and the lack of explanation for excess payment from the settlement proceeds. The judge has also noted inconsistencies in the attorney's fees claimed. The petitions have been denied without prejudice, meaning that the petitioners can refile the petitions and address the issues raised by the judge.
