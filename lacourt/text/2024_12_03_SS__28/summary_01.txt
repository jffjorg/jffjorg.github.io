Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to compel the plaintiff, Sasoon Abramian, to attend an orthopedic examination in California. The examination will be conducted by board-certified orthopedic surgeon Scott K. Forman, M.D. at California Orthopaedic Specialists in Newport Beach, California. The examination will consist of an interview and a physical examination, and will not be invasive. The defendants will pay for Dr. Forman's examination fees and related costs, and the plaintiff will be responsible for any cancellation fees that arise from his conduct.

The judge's ruling is based on the court's finding of good cause, despite the plaintiff's counsel's earlier agreement to an orthopedic examination in California. The judge notes that the issue is not moot due to the plaintiff's shifting positions on his place of residence. The examination is to take place on a date and time to be agreed upon by the parties, but no later than 30 days after the court's order.
