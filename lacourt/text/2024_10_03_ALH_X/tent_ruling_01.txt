  Case Number:  21BBCV00436    Hearing Date:   October 3, 2024    Dept:  X Motions
(2) to Compel Further Responses to Discovery 
 
Plaintiffs move for an order compelling a further response to Request for Production of Documents (Set Four, from Mark Strauss) and Special Interrogatories (Set One,
from Mark Strauss).
 
Plaintiffs’
Claims 
This
case arises from Plaintiffs Rhonda Strauss and Mark Strauss’ (“Plaintiffs”)
claim that Defendants unlawfully placed tracking devices on Plaintiffs’
vehicle.  Plaintiffs filed this complaint
on May 5, 2021 alleging one cause of action for invasion of privacy.  Plaintiffs claim the tracking devices were
placed during a prior personal injury lawsuit filed by Plaintiff Rhonda Strauss
arising from a slip and fall incident at a Vons location. 
 
Plaintiffs’ Motions Are
Granted In Part and Denied In Part
The
motion compelling a further response to special interrogatories is granted as
to Special Interrogatory Nos. 23 and 25. 
The responses may be limited to the requested persons knowledgeable about
any authorization and/or placement of tracking devices on Rhonda Strauss in
connection with the underlying lawsuit.  The
motion is denied as to Nos. 24 and 26.
 
The
motion compelling a further response to requests for production is granted as
to Request No. 34, and is denied in all other respects.  The Court finds Defendant has met its burden
to demonstrate attorney-client privilege and how the requested documents in Nos.
29, 30, 32, 33, 37, and 38 are attorney work-product.  The Court further sustains the objections to
Request Nos. 31, 35, 36, and 39 as the requested documents are either
irrelevant/overbroad or contain confidential and proprietary information
including trade secrets. Moving Party is to give notice.
