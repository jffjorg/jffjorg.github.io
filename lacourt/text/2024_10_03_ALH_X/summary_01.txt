And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to discovery. The plaintiffs, Rhonda and Mark Strauss, have moved to compel a response to special interrogatories and requests for production of documents. The judge has granted the motion in part, compelling a response to special interrogatory numbers 23 and 25, which relate to the authorization and placement of tracking devices on Rhonda Strauss's vehicle. The judge has also granted the motion in part, compelling a response to request number 34, but has denied the motion in all other respects. The judge has sustained objections to certain requests for production, finding that the requested documents are either irrelevant, overbroad, or contain confidential and proprietary information. The judge has also found that the defendant has met its burden to demonstrate attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine, and has denied the motion as to certain requests for production.
