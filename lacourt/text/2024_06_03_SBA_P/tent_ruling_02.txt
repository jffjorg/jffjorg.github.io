Plaintiff Mira Costa Band Boosters, Inc. is ordered to file and serve its amended complaint within 30 days of this proceeding.BACKGROUNDOn 12/05/2023, Plaintiff Mira Costa Band Boosters, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants ZNK Partners, LLC, a Texas limited liability company, dba Lone Star Percussion (“Lone Star”), Yamaha Corporation of America (“Yamaha”), and Does 1 through 10, inclusive, asserting one cause of action for breach of contract.On February 28, 2024, the Court sustained Yamaha’s demurrer to the Complaint with leave to amend.On April 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint for (1) breach of contract, and (2) negligent misrepresentation. The case arises from the purchase of Yamaha musical equipment from Lone Star.On April 30, 2024, Yamaha filed the instant demurrer to the second cause of action for negligent misrepresentation on basis that the FAC fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.On May 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed its opposition.On May 24, 2024, Yamaha filed its reply.LEGAL STANDARDA demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747. When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context. Wilson v. Transit Authority of City of Sacramento (1962) 199 Cal.App.2d 716, 720-21.In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994. “A demurrer tests the pleading alone, and not on the evidence or facts alleged.” E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315. As such, the court assumes the truth of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. Ibid. However, it does not accept as true deductions, contentions, or conclusions of law or fact. Stonehouse Homes LLC v. City of Sierra Madre (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 531, 538.A demurrer may be sustained “only if the complaint fails to state a cause of action under any possible legal theory.” Sheehan v. San Francisco 49ers, Ltd. (2009) 45 Cal.4th 992, 998.“If a complaint does not state a cause of action, but there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment, leave to amend must be granted.” Milligan v. Golden Gate Bridge Highway & Transportation Dist. (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1, 6.DISCUSSIONYamaha argues that Plaintiff fails to plead negligent misrepresentation with the requisite specificity, and further that the pleading cannot be on information and belief.Negligent misrepresentation requires assertion of an untrue fact that is believed by the defendant to be true, lack of reasonable ground for the belief, defendant’s intent to induce plaintiff’s reliance upon the representation, plaintiff’s justifiable reliance upon the representation, and resulting damage. (Moncada v. West Coast Quartz Corp. (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 768, 781; Charnay v. Cobert (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 170, 184.) Negligent misrepresentation, like fraud, must be pled with specificity. (Small v. Fritz Companies, Inc. (2003) 30 Cal.4th 167, 184.) “The particularity demands that a plaintiff plead facts which show how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were tendered.” (Cansino v. Bank of America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1469.) In the case of a corporate defendant, the plaintiff must allege the names of the persons who made the representations, their authority to speak on behalf of the corporation, to whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when the representation was made. (West v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 780, 793.)Here, there are insufficient allegations. The FAC states in relevant part: “Specifically, in order to purchase Yamaha musical percussion equipment, Yamaha required customers to conduct business through one of its “authorized dealers,” which Yamaha held out to the public asbeing a viable company in which to purchase Yamaha musical equipment. MCBB purchased Yamaha musical equipment from Lone Star, which at all times relevant herein, was an authorized dealer of Yamaha . . . MCBB is “informed and believes” that Yamaha and DOES 6 through 10, inclusive, represented to the general public, including MCBB, that purchase of its equipment was required through one if its “authorized dealers,” including Lone Star. MCBB is “informed and believes” that Yamaha and DOES 6 through 10, inclusive, further represented to the general public, including MCBB, that Lone Star was a viable company that would fulfill the purchase of Yamaha equipment.” (FAC, ¶¶6, 16-17.) There are no facts showing how, when, where, who or by what means Yamaha represented to the general public that Lone Star was an authorized dealer and to purchase equipment from it.For those reasons, the Demurrer is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.Moving party is ordered to give notice.
