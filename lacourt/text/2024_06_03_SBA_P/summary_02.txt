Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Mira Costa Band Boosters, Inc. v. ZNK Partners, LLC, dba Lone Star Percussion, Yamaha Corporation of America. The plaintiff, Mira Costa Band Boosters, Inc., filed a complaint against the defendants alleging breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation. The defendants, ZNK Partners, LLC, dba Lone Star Percussion, and Yamaha Corporation of America, demurred to the complaint, arguing that the plaintiff failed to state a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation. The court has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, ordering the plaintiff to file and serve an amended complaint within 30 days. The court found that the plaintiff's allegations of negligent misrepresentation were insufficient, as they failed to specify the facts showing how, when, where, who or by what means the defendants represented to the public that Lone Star was an authorized dealer.
