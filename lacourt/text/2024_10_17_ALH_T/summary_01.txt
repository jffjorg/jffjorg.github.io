And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the application of Attorney John E. Tyrrell to appear pro hac vice in the products liability action brought by Plaintiff Harrigan against Defendant Columbus McKinnon Corporation. The application was filed by the defendant on September 23, 2024, and was not opposed by the plaintiff or any other party. The judge found several errors in the application and supporting documents, including the failure to serve the application via mail to the State Bar with proof of service, the payment of a $50 fee when the current fee is $500, and the lack of proof of Tyrrell's exact residential address. The judge also noted inconsistencies in the addresses provided by the attorney of record for the defendant, Robert E. Davies. As a result, the judge denied the application for pro hac vice.
