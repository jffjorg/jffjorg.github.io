Significant Statements:
The Court concludes that the FAC does not adequately plead which contractual terms were breached by alleging simply that “Defendants removed or permitted the removal of Newland’s Coins from Newland’s segregated account . . . without Newland’s consent.” The Court sustains the demurrer to the seventh cause of action with leave to amend. The Court overrules the demurrer to the eighth cause of action, finding that the FAC sufficiently alleges breach of bailment.
