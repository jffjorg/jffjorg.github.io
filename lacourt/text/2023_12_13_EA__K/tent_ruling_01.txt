  Case Number:  19PSCV00643    Hearing Date:   December 13, 2023    Dept:  K Background[1]   
Case No. 19PSCV00643
Plaintiffs Syed M. Hammad Rizvi (“Rizvi”), Afsah Moinuddin (“Moinuddin”) and
Eagle Ridge Property Management, LLC (“Eagle Ridge”) (collectively,
“Plaintiffs”) allege as follows:
Rizvi and Moinuddin are married and formed Eagle Ridge to hold title to
their primary residence located at 10068 Eagle Ridge Court, Rancho Cucamonga,
CA (“Eagle Ridge Residence”). In March 2018, Rizvi met Vincente Cuevas (“V.
Cuevas”) outside of a partially completed home located on a 1.24 acre
lot at 1533 Calle Cristina, San Dimas, California (“the Cristina Property”). V.
Cuevas represented that he was the owner and builder of the Cristina Property.
After Rizvi consulted with his banker and informed V. Cuevas that he was unable
to purchase the Cristina Property, V. Cuevas advised Rizvi that he could help
Rizvi structure the purchase and arrange a loan so he could afford to buy it.
V. Cuevas subsequently introduced Rizvi to Kevin Cornell (“Cornell”) of KWC
Realty Services, Inc. dba Priority One Mortgage (“Priority One”).  
 
In April 2018, Cornell
told Rizvi that he could obtain a purchase and construction loan to finish the
construction of the home and that there would be at least one year of reserve
funds (later modified to six months) to pay for the construction and monthly
interest payments while the construction was being completed. V. Cuevas also
promised Rizvi that he would refer $1.2 million of the purchase price for at
least 5 years. Rizvi decided to purchase the Cristina Property and engaged
Cornell and Priority One to assist as the mortgage broker. Cornell advised
Rizvi that he would help fill out the salient information in the Uniform
Residential Loan Application (“Loan Application”) and told Rizvi to ignore the
asset, liability or income sections on same. The Loan Application Cornell
initially sent to Rizvi was partial only and indicated that the loan was for
the purchase of a primary residence. Cornell also advised Rizvi that Plaintiffs
should take title to the Cristina Property under Eagle Ridge. Plaintiffs signed
the purchase agreement on April 19, 2018. 
 
On May 9, 2018, Cornell
provided Rizvi with a completed Loan Application which modified the purpose of
the property from “primary residence” to “investment.” On June 18, 2018,
Plaintiffs executed a promissory note with Diligent Lending, a hard money lender,
for the principal sum of $2,699,000.00. Per the terms of the promissory note,
Plaintiffs were to make interest only payments of $25,033.15 per month, with an
interest rate of 10.99%, and a 28.99% default interest rate (“Note”). A deed of
trust in the principal amount of the Note was recorded. On May 28, 2018,
Cornell sent a short form deed of trust to Rizvi and told him to sign and
return it. A deed of trust in the amount of $940,000.00 was then recorded in
second position in favor of Cuevas and Jesus
Anthony Rubio (identified therein as “Tony Rubio;” hereinafter, “Rubio”)
and references a note, even though no such note exists; although Plaintiffs
executed a note for $2,040,000.00 in favor of V. Cuevas and Rubio, Cornell and
V. Cuevas told Plaintiffs that this $2,040,000.00 reflected the amount owed to
Rubio by V. Cuevas previously secured by the Cristina Property in first
position as well as V. Cuevas’s equity in the Cristina Property that he was
willing to forego for at least five years. The $2,040,000.00 note is not
reflected in the escrow instructions or closing statement but indicates that it
is secured by a deed of trust on the Cristina Property. Cornell, Priority One
and Diligent Lending purposefully and fraudulently characterized the Note as a
business purpose loan.
 
Shortly
after escrow closed, on August 23, 2018, Rizvi received a notice from Diligent
Lending demanding that he start making monthly interest payments of $25,033.15
on the Note. Rizvi asked Diligent Lending about the 6 months interest reserve
that was supposedly built into the loan but was told by Cornell and Diligent
Lending that there were no reserve funds. Plaintiffs had to refinance the Eagle
Ridge Residence and get equity out to save the Cristina Property. Now that
Plaintiffs had to use the equity in the Eagle Ridge Residence to maintain the
Note payments, though, Plaintiffs did not sufficient funds for a down payment
to refinance. Plaintiffs have since defaulted on their obligations under the
Note.
On July 18, 2019,
Plaintiffs filed a complaint, asserting causes of action against Diligent
Lending, Priority One, Cornell and Does 1-100 for:

Case No. 19PSCV00656
Rubio alleges as follows:
In the summer of 2017, V. Cuevas, Maria G. Cuevas (“M. Cuevas”) and New Home
Design & Construction (“NHDC”) approached Rubio about investing in a
construction and development project at the Cristina Property. V. Cuevas
and Rubio agreed that Rubio would receive a 30% interest in the project and an
additional 5% of the profits when the Cristina Property was sold and the
project was complete. V. Cuevas represented to Rubio that there was only one
loan on the Cristina Property, a $1,000,000.00 seller carry back, and that the
Cristina Property had been appraised to be work $4.9 million on completion.
Rubio subsequently loaned monies to V. Cuevas totaling $800,000.00 between July
25-December 11, 2017, which was documented by a promissory note and deed of
trust. In April, 2018 Rubio learned that the Cristina Property was in
foreclosure and at risk of being sold. V. Cuevas assured Rubio that his
investment was safe and that a new investor would pay off the existing
financing and provided security for Rubio’s investment. V. Cuevas told Rubio
that he would need to surrender his lien on the Cristina
Property in exchange for a larger lien so that additional construction
lending could be obtained by Rizvi, whom V. Cuevas represented was his “new
partner” on the project. V. Cuevas told Rubio that Rizvi’s involvement would
allow Rubio to make more money and that Rizvi would pay Rubio an additional
$125,000.00 in cash within two weeks of closing. Rubio’s security interest in
the Cristina Property was subsequently released on order to facilitate the
Rizvi note and deed of trust. Rubio did not receive the $125,000.00 promised
after escrow closed. Rubio has unsuccessfully demanded a return of the loan
monies. On June 11, 2019, a new lender recorded and served a notice of default
and intent to sell the Cristina Property.
On July 23, 2019, Rubio filed a complaint, asserting causes of action
against V. Cuevas, Maria G. Cuevas, Home Design & Construction and Does
1-10 for:
1.

Discussion
The Law Offices of
Edward T. Weber (“Firm”) seeks to be relieved as counsel of record for
Bayshore, FMC and Rushmyfile
(“Clients”).
The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw,
and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the
client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. (See
Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People v. Prince
(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398.)
California
Rule of Court (“CRC”) Rule 3.1362 requires (1) a notice of motion and motion
directed to the client (made on the Notice
of Motion and Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a
declaration stating in general terms and without compromising the
confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of
Civil Procedure § 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under section
284(1) (made on the Declaration in
Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form
(MC-052)); (3) service of the notice of motion and motion, the declaration, and
the proposed order on the client and on all other parties who have appeared in
the case; and (4) a proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). The court may delay the effective
date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy of the
signed order on the client has been filed with the court.
Attorney Edward T. Weber (“Weber”) represents, in relevant part, that
Clients have ceased operations and that he has no further authority to defend
or represent them in this action. Weber also represents that Substitutions of
Counsel cannot be obtained as there is no new attorney available to take over
the case.
Weber states that he has served Clients by mail at Clients’ last known
address(s) with copies of the respective motion papers served with his
declaration and that he has confirmed within the past 30 days that the
address(es) are current, via communications by emails to Clients multiple
times.
The court
determines that the requirements of Rules of Court Rule 3.1362 enumerated above have been
sufficiently met.
Accordingly,
the motions are granted, effective upon the filing of the
respective proofs of service showing service of the respective
signed orders upon the respective Clients at the respective Clients’ last known address(es).
The court will set an Order to
Show Cause Re: Representation of Corporations for January 16, 2024 at 9:00 a.m.
