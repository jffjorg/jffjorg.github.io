And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the demurrer filed by The Bread Factory Artisans, Inc. (BFA) to the complaint filed by Oscar Rideau, a minor, against Smart & Final LLC, Smart & Final Stores, LLC, and BFA. The court has granted BFA's request for judicial notice of various documents and has considered the arguments presented by both sides.

The court has sustained BFA's demurrer on the basis of Code of Civil Procedure § 430.10, subdivision (c), which prohibits a second action between the same parties on the same cause of action. The court has determined that the two actions, Case No. BC700926 and Case No. 23PSCV02834, involve the same issues, parties, and injury allegations, and that the same primary right is involved in both actions. The court has entered an interlocutory judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 597.

The court has declined Plaintiff's request to stay this action pending the outcome of Plaintiff's writ filed in Case No. BC700926. The court has also rejected BFA's contention that the sham pleading doctrine applies in this case, finding that the doctrine is inapplicable where a party does not attempt to circumvent a court's ruling by omitting facts or adding inconsistent allegations.
